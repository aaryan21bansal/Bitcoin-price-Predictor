"Addiction services in England could struggle to cope with ""soaring"" numbers of people misusing alcohol, the Royal College of Psychiatrists is warning. Many adults are drinking more since the coronavirus pandemic began,data shows,external. The college estimates that in June, more than 8.4m people in England were drinking at higher-risk levels, up from 4.8m in February. It says deep cuts made to addiction services could mean patients will miss out on life-saving care. 'I became alcoholic during lockdown' 'Tackle harmful lockdown drinking' The rise in risky drinking comes at a time when more people addicted to opiates are seeking help from addiction services, says the college, referring to National Drug Treatment Monitoring System statistics showing 3,459 new adult cases in April - up 20% from 2,947 in the same month the previous year. Check how much you are drinking,external Guidelines advise people drink no more than 14 units of alcohol (equivalent to six large glasses of wine or six pints of beer) a week, spreading consumption over three days or more. Drinking too much can damage your liver and increases the risk of other health conditions such as heart disease and stroke. People with alcohol use disorder are more likely to develop serious complications if they catch Covid-19. The college is asking the government to invest millions more in addiction services. Prof Julia Sinclair, chair of the college's addictions faculty, said: ""Covid-19 has shown just how stretched, under-resourced and ill-equipped addiction services are to treat the growing numbers of vulnerable people living with this complex illness. ""There are now only five NHS inpatient units in the country, and no resource anywhere in my region to admit people who are alcohol dependent with co-existing mental illness. ""Drug-related deaths and alcohol-related hospital admissions were already at all-time highs before Covid-19. I fear that unless the government acts quickly we will see these numbers rise exponentially."" Laura Bunt from the drug, alcohol and mental health charityWe Are With You,externalsaid: ""Social isolation and a lack of a human connection is a big factor behind why some people turn to alcohol as a coping mechanism, so clearly the pandemic continues to be really tough for many people. ""When you consider that the UK had some of the highest levels of alcohol-related harms in Europe even before the lockdown in March, the need for government action now is clear."" A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: ""We have increased their funding this year, providing over Â£3.2 billion to spend on public health services like addiction. ""We support evidence-based approaches to reduce the health-related harms of drug misuse and, as part of our NHS Long Term Plan, alcohol care teams will be introduced in hospitals where alcohol-related admissions are high, intervening in 50,000 cases over five years to reduce harm.""

"Sir Patrick Vallance says he ""argued stronger than anyone for action for lockdown"" The government's chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance has said he was rebuked for arguing strongly in favour of imposing Covid lockdown restrictions earlier this year, it has emerged. In an email uncovered by a BBC Freedom of Information request, Sir Patrick reveals he was given a ""telling off"" from other senior officials. Some scientists argue lives could have been saved had a lockdown been introduced earlier. The government insists there was ""no delay"". In a statement, the Department of Health and Social Care said government policy had been ""guided by the advice of world-renowned scientists"". Did herd immunity change the course of the outbreak? The UK has one of the highest number of coronavirus deaths per capita in the world, though officials insist it's too early to draw accurate comparisons with other countries. The Department for Health and Social Care insists there was no delay in locking down. The email obtained by the BBC appears to be a discussion of aSunday Times article,externalin May criticising the delays in announcing a lockdown in March.

A full lockdown was not introduced until 23 March. It's now thought the number of cases rose dramatically in the period just before that.

"Only four of Marseille's resuscitation beds were free, officials said The use of hospital beds by Covid-19 patients in the French city of Marseille is ""close to saturation"" amid a sharp spike in infections. Surgeries are being reduced to cope with an incidence rate that has risen to 312 per 100,000 since September. New limits on gatherings are being introduced around Marseille and in the south-western city of Bordeaux. The two cities are the main new hotspots ina country that on Saturday recorded a big surge in cases. The 10,561 new infections over 24 hours represented the biggest rise since large-scale testing began. The figures for Sunday and Monday were lower - as tends to be the case for weekend reporting - but the seven-day rolling average, which smoothes out these irregularities, recorded an increase in infections for the 28th day in a row. Europe lockdown: New coronavirus rules country-by-country France has recorded more than 425,000 infections, and almost 31,000 deaths, in the coronavirus epidemic, Johns Hopkins University research shows. On Friday, Prime Minister Jean Castex warned of ""worrying developments"" in Marseille and its department of Bouches-du-RhÃ´ne, and in Bordeaux. He called for new measures to be laid out by Monday. At a briefing on Monday, Philippe de Mester, director general of the Provence-Alpes-CÃ´te d'Azur health agency, said the rate of positive tests had reached 10.6% in Marseille and 8.5% in the Bouches-du-RhÃ´ne overall. Intensive care capacity was close to overload. Marseille hospitals director Jean-Olivier Arnaud said 31 of 35 resuscitation beds and 129 of 155 dedicated Covid patient beds were in use, adding: ""We are not far from saturation."" ""We are at the top of the national ranking of departments whose situation is developing the most unfavourably,"" Mr de Mester said. The Bordeaux region has also seen a large spike Yann Bubien, a Bordeaux hospital director and a member of the government's Covid scientific advisory council, said there had been ""a very rapid increase over the past 10 days"" in the city. ""All the warning signals are flashing red,"" he said. In Marseille and the Bouches-du-RhÃ´ne until 1 October: Large-scale gatherings for the public limited to 1,000 seated people, with minimum one-metre (3ft) distance Student parties banned and school outings suspended No private meetings of more than 10 people, including on beaches and in parks, in high-risk areas Masks compulsory in 27 high-risk areas in the department from 06:00 (04:00 GMT) to 02:00 (00:00 GMT), except in large outdoor areas Very similar measures were introduced for Bordeaux, including the 1,000 limit on large-scale gatherings and 10-person limit on private meetings.

"Blowing a ram's horn is a key feature of Rosh Hashanah - but extra care must be taken this year The government has issued highly detailed dos and don'ts for the UK Jewish community as it celebrates its most important festivals of the year. Rosh Hashanah, Yom Kippur and Sukkot normally involve packed synagogues and large family gatherings. This year, synagogues will have to ensure social distancing and avoid communal prayer shawls and books. The person blowing the shofar (ram's horn) for Rosh Hashanah should keep 2m from other worshippers. Hope for better times as festivals begin Beginning on Friday, the three-week period known as the Days of Awe is the central feature of the Jewish religious year, but many of its traditions will be impossible this year. A long checklist,externalmakes clear that synagogues can be used as long as Covid secure measures are in place. 'Religion helped me through lockdown' What are the changes to places of worship? What is the future of religious worship in the UK? But communal prayer books and prayer shawls, normally strewn around the synagogue, must be removed with worshippers told to bring their own prayer books. Microphones should be used where possible, though these would normally be unacceptable in orthodox synagogues. Mask-wearing is advised, and people should not mix in groups of more than six in line with the new limits on social gatherings. SOCIAL DISTANCING:What are the rules now? SCHOOLS:What will happen if children catch coronavirus? LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? YOUR QUESTIONS:We answer your queries The guidance acknowledges that the ""rule of six"" will have a particular impact on the tradition of hospitality around Sukkot - the Feast of Tabernacles, which marks the end of harvest and commemorates the Exodus from Egypt. Running from 2 October to 9 October this year, the festival normally involves constructing ""sukkah"" the little shelter many Jews build in their gardens to eat in during the eight-day Succot festival. Normally guests would be invited and crammed inside, but now the limit is six people - unless the social bubble is bigger than that. Sharing food or cutlery is out, as are social gatherings in a communal sukkah and ""sukkah crawls"" across the community. A central feature of Rosh Hashanah - the Jewish New Year - is the blowing of the shofar, a musical instrument made from a ram's horn that may present a risk for a virus spread through droplets. To reduce the risk, the guidance says the shofar blower must be at least 2m from anyone else, and it should not be blown towards anyone. There is also detailed guidance for a ceremony known as Tashlich, where on Rosh Hashanah worshippers go to a body of moving water like a river and figuratively throw away their sins. This video can not be played Losing a âbeacon of lightâ of the UKâs ultra-Orthodox community to coronavirus As well as the rule of six and social distancing, the guidance says items used during the ceremony should not be shared, such as prayer books or the breadcrumbs that some worshippers cast on the water. Meanwhile, the Prince of Wales has been appointed patron of a Jewish youth organisation as it celebrates in 125th year. Neil Martin, chief executive of the JLGB (Jewish Lads' and Girls' Brigade), said it is an ""absolute honour"" and praised the prince as ""a tremendous believer in the power of young people"".

"This video can not be played Boris Johnson: ""I have absolutely no desire to use these measures"" Boris Johnson has said the UK must reserve the right to override the Brexit deal to protect the country's ""economic and political integrity"". The PM said legislation was needed to resolve ""tensions"" in the EU-UK deal. He said it would ensure the UK could not be ""broken up"" by a foreign power and the EU was acting in an ""extreme way"", by threatening food exports. Labour said the PM had caused the ""mess"" by reneging on a deal he had previously called a ""triumph"". The Internal Market Bill is expected to pass its first parliamentary test shortly, when MPs vote on it at about 22.00 BST, despite the reservations of many MPs that it gives the UK the power to break international law. A number of Conservative MPs have said they will not support the bill as it stands and some could register their concerns by abstaining. How could the Northern Ireland Brexit deal change? Brexit bill powers 'insurance policy' for UK Blair and Major urge MPs to reject Brexit bill The UK left the EU on 31 January, having negotiated and signed the withdrawal agreement with the bloc. A key part of the agreement - which is now an international treaty - was the Northern Ireland Protocol, designed to prevent a hard border returning to the island of Ireland. The Internal Market Bill proposed by the government would override that part of that agreement when it comes to movement of goods between Northern Ireland and Britain and would allow the UK to re-interpret ""state aid"" rules on subsidies for firms in Northern Ireland, in the event of the two sides not agreeing a future trade deal. Speaking at the start of the five-hour debate, the PM said the bill should be ""welcomed by everyone"" who cares about the ""sovereignty and integrity of the UK"". He said the UK had signed up to the ""finely balanced"" withdrawal agreement, including the Northern Ireland Protocol, in ""good faith"" and was committed to honouring its obligations, including the introduction of ""light touch"" checks on trade between Britain and Northern Ireland. But he said additional ""protective powers"" were now necessary to guard against the EU's ""proven willingness"" to interpret aspects of the agreement in ""absurd"" ways, ""simply to exert leverage"" in the trade talks. This video can not be played Ed Miliband says it is not an argument of Leave versus Remain, but âan argument about right versus wrongâ. ""What we cannot tolerate now is a situation where our EU counterparts seriously believe they have the power to break up our country,"" he told MPs. ""We cannot have a situation where the very boundaries of our country can be dictated to by a foreign power or international organisation."" He also suggested the EU was threatening not to allow British firms to export products of animal origin to either the continent or Northern Ireland. ""Absurd and self-defeating as that action would be...the EU still have not taken this revolver off the table,"" he told MPs. However, he sought to reassure MPs that the powers were an ""insurance policy"" and Parliament would be given a vote before they were ever invoked, insisting ""I have absolutely no desire to use these measures"". But former Labour leader Ed Miliband, standing in for Sir Keir Starmer afterthe Labour leader was forced to self-isolate at home, said the ""very act of passing the law"" would constitute a breach of international law. He told MPs the PM ""could not blame anyone else"", having drawn up and signed the Brexit deal himself. ""It is his deal, it is his mess, it is his failure,"" he said. ""For the first time in his life, it is time to take responsibility and to fess up,"" he said. ""Either he was not straight with the country in the first place or he did not understand it."" He added: ""This is not just legislative hooliganism on any issue, it is on the most sensitive issue of all."" Among Tory MPs to speak out were ex-ministers Andrew Mitchell, Sir Bob Neill and Stephen Hammond, all of whom urged the government to settle differences with the EU through the arbitration process in the Agreement. Conservative MP Charles Walker said the EU was a ""pain in the neck"" but urged the government not to ""press the nuclear button"" before all other options had been exhausted. ""I am not going to be voting for this bill at second reading because if you keep whacking a dog, don't be surprised when it bites you back,"" he said. And Former Chancellor Sajid Javid has joined the ranks of potential rebels, saying he could not see why it was necessary to ""pre-emptively renege"" on the withdrawal agreement. ""Breaking international law is never a step that should be taken lightly,""he tweeted,external. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

A senior government source told the BBC ""all options are on the table"" in terms of possible action against Tory MPs who do not support the bill. The bill, which sets out how trade between different nations of the UK will operate after the UK leaves the EU single market on 31 December, is likely to face more difficulties in its later stages, especially in the House of Lords. The DUP's Sammy Wilson welcomed the bill, but said his party still had concerns and would be tabling amendments to ""ensure Northern Ireland is not left in a state aid straight jacket and our businesses are not weighed down by unnecessary paperwork when trading within the United Kingdom"". The SNP's Ian Blackford said the bill was the ""greatest threat"" to devolved government in Scotland since the establishment of the Scottish Parliament 20 years ago. This video can not be played David Cameron said he has âmisgivings about what is being proposedâ ""We are discussing the details of a bill which this government casually and brazenly admits breaks international and domestic law, he said. Five former prime ministers have raised concerns about the bill, including Boris Johnson's predecessor Theresa May - who is absent from Monday's debate as she is on a visit to South Korea. Speaking earlier on Monday, David Cameron said ""passing an act of Parliament and then going on to break an international treaty obligation...should be the absolute final resort"".

"Boris Johnson's government has a hefty majority. It was never going to lose Monday night's vote in the Commons. Downing Street calculates that most of the public won't pay that much attention to yet more Westminster argy-bargy about the Brexit process.

And where it does, they would much more likely take the side of the government taking a tough line with the EU than share the concerns of former prime ministers or august lawyers foaming about the government's behaviour. Read full story as PM's Brexit bill clears first hurdle How could the Brexit deal change? Fifth ex-PM speaks out against post-Brexit bill And yet -  first off, to state the obvious, opposition from former occupants of No 10, former chancellors and former cabinet ministers is not exactly a sign of peace and harmony. There are plenty of people who are not, as one cabinet minister claimed to be, ""supremely relaxed"" about the government admitting that its strategy could break international law if it helps get a deal with the EU. Second, the current Downing Street might relish the idea of uniting their opponents - former Remainers, the Lords, and much of the legal profession just like this time last year. But the resistance to No 10 goes beyond the usual suspects this time. Some Brexiteers are spitting chips too - one senior Tory, raging, told me ""we can never go back from this"". And crucially a couple of the new group of MPs were brave enough to stick their heads above the parapets too. More MPs may well vote against the government when it comes to making changes to the legislation next week - easier to back tweaks then, than try to block the bill outright on Monday. This video can not be played Miliband to Johnson: ""He hasn't read the bill"" But, at the other end of Parliament, where there is even more gold leaf, the legislation is likely to go slap bang into a very fancy red and gilt wall. As things stand, this bill is deeply unlikely to make it through the House of Lords, so expect a painful back and forth over many weeks that could suck up parliamentary time, effort and political oxygen when the government is trying to deal with another big crisis. To try perhaps to avert some of that, Boris Johnson held a conference call with Conservative peers on Monday night, but one of those listening was rather less than complimentary of what the prime minister had to say. This video can not be played Boris Johnson: ""I have absolutely no desire to use these measures"" There is also some suspicion among some who have previously supported the government at its form of tactics. Bang the pots, crash the conventions, create noise so, as we discussed last week, if in the end the government backs down and signs a deal, well, an impression has been created that the bravado is what got things over the line. That would of course be denied by ministers, adamant the legislation is necessary. Yet for some in government, there is no denying this is an uncomfortable moment - a strategy that could be worth it, if it shows the EU a seriousness of intent. But it is far from clear that the outcome will be worth the risk. PS. If, as many MPs are wondering, you are pondering why the Northern Ireland Secretary, Brandon Lewis,said what he said at the despatch box last week,which lit the fuse on what would already have been a big row in Parliament, I'm told that his candour was entirely deliberate and a plan for him to utter those exact words had been discussed and signed off in government. The sentiment was, it's said, that having agreed on a course of action (to drive the EU and opponents crazy or to quite rightly protect the UK, delete depending on your political preferences) ministers ought to be explicit about what was happening, and indeed, no cabinet minister could mislead the House of Commons. It is however worth noting that no minister since then has been quite so ready to repeat Mr Lewis' admission. Let's see, after this first vote, if any others are willing to go there.

"This video can not be played David Cameron said he has âmisgivings about what is being proposedâ David Cameron has become the fifth former prime minister to criticise a new bill attempting to override the Brexit withdrawal agreement. No 10 says the Internal Market Bill was a ""critical piece of legislation for the UK"". But Mr Cameron said he had ""misgivings"" over it and breaking an international treaty should be the ""final resort"". Former Tory PMs Theresa May and Sir John Major, and Labour's Tony Blair and Gordon Brown have condemned the plan. However, Boris Johnson's official spokesman said the bill delivered a ""vital legal safety net"" so the government can ""take the necessary steps to ensure the integrity of UK's internal market"" - steps it hoped never to have to use. Brexit bill powers 'insurance policy' for UK Blair and Major urge MPs to reject Brexit bill 'Firm and strong' EU response expected - Irish PM MPs have begun debating the bill at its second reading, with the PM making the opening remarks, and it is expected to pass this early stage after a vote at around 22:00. But the legislation is likely to face more difficulties in its later stages, especially when the bill heads for debate in the Lords. Former Attorney General Geoffrey Cox accused Mr Johnson of doing""unconscionable"" damage to Britain's international reputationand said he would ""withhold"" his support for the bill in its current form. The PM's special envoy for Freedom of Religion or Belief, Tory MP Rehman Chishti,has resigned over the proposed law,external, saying: ""I have always acted in a manner which respects the rule of law... [and] voting for this bill as it currently stands would be contrary to the values I hold dearest."" A senior government source told the BBC ""all options are on the table"" in terms of possible action against Tory MPs who do not support the bill. Labour's shadow business secretary, Ed Miliband, also called the proposed law ""legislative hooliganism"". Mr Miliband will stand in for Sir Keir Starmer at the opposition dispatch box afterthe Labour leader was forced to self-isolate at homewhen a member of his household developed possible coronavirus symptoms. The UK left the EU on 31 January, having negotiated and signed the withdrawal agreement with the bloc. The two sides are now in the closing weeks of negotiations for a post-Brexit trade deal beforethe transition periodends on 31 December - with informal talks taking place in Brussels this week. A key part of the withdrawal agreement - which is now an international treaty - was the Northern Ireland Protocol, designed to prevent a hard border returning to the island of Ireland. The Internal Market Bill proposed by the government would override that part of that agreement when it came to goods and would allow the UK to modify or re-interpret ""state aid"" rules on subsidies for firms in Northern Ireland, in the event of the two sides not agreeing a future trade deal. Last week,Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis said the bill would ""break international law"" in a ""specific and limited way"", leading to swathes of criticism from all sides of the political spectrum. Here we go again... a Brexit deadline looms, there's a whole lot of noise about it in Westminster, and the UK and the EU can't agree. And yes, yet again, there is a swirling soup of jargon every other sentence. Take a few steps back though, and here is what this all amounts to - how the UK will trade with its nearest neighbours from January next year onwards and how the different parts of the UK will trade with each other. This matters economically - and matters politically too. The Brexit process has long exposed the tensions between the UK and Brussels, but don't underestimate the tensions it places on the UK as well. Those in Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales who have long argued to be unshackled from London, as they see it, argue Brexit is the ultimate case study to illustrate their argument. And so the government at Westminster's delicate task is to extricate the UK from one union, the EU, while holding together another one, the UK. All of these rows have that central aim at their core. Mr Cameron - who called the EU referendum when he was PM - said he had ""misgivings about what is being proposed"". Speaking to reporters, he said: ""Passing an act of Parliament and then going on to break an international treaty obligation is the very, very last thing you should contemplate. It should be the absolute final resort."" Mr Cameron said the ""bigger picture"" was about trying to get a trade deal with the EU, urging the government to ""keep that context [and] that big prize in mind."" The comments follow stronger criticism by the four other surviving former prime ministers of the UK. Mrs May, who still sits as an MP in the Commons, said breaking international law would damage ""trust"" in the UK, while Mr Brown said it would be akin to ""self-harm"" for the country. Sir John and Mr Blair - who were both in office during key periods of the Northern Ireland peace process -wrote a joint article in the Sunday Times,externalaccusing Mr Johnson of ""embarrassing"" the UK and urging MPs to reject the ""shameful"" attempt to override parts of the withdrawal agreement. Earlier, Policing Minister Kit Malthouse called the bill a ""practical"" step, saying it ""solves the problem that we're faced with"" over the future of trade with the EU. He told BBC Breakfast: ""What we've done is to say transparently that this is a situation which we think may occur - certainly that's what's being intimated from the EU. It's a problem we have to solve so here's a bill that solves it. ""In the end those people that oppose this bill have to tell us what the resolution is."" On Sunday, Justice Secretary Robert Buckland told the BBC the bill was an ""insurance policy"" in case the UK and EU do not agree a post-Brexit trade deal. He said he hoped powers being sought by ministers would never be needed, and that he would resign if the UK ended up breaking international law ""in a way I find unacceptable"". But Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer accused government ministers of handing out ""misinformation"" over the weekend and ""spinning"" the reasons they were pursuing the new bill. He told LBC: ""[Mr Johnson] is making a mistake reneging on a treaty - that will have reputational damage for the UK. ""I would say to the prime minister, look go away, go back to the drawing board, drop these problems, don't act in this reckless and wrong way and we'll look again at the legislation."" This video can not be played Robert Buckland: ""If I see the rule of law being broken in a way that I find unacceptable then of course I will go"" The bill has split opinion on the Tory backbenches. MP Sir Desmond Swayne said he would be supporting the bill, praising the government for preparing in case no trade deal is agreed by the end of the year. He told BBC News: ""If the government didn't take precautions against that possibility, it would be utterly negligent. It is right it arm itself with the powers just in case."" But his colleague, and chair of the Justice Select Committee, Sir Bob Neill, said the government and its supporters needed to ""calm the language"". He said there was already a mechanism for addressing the government's concerns, but he was willing to ""meet them half-way"" with an amendment to the bill - only allowing the elements that would break international law to be used if Parliament signs it off.

"Blowing a ram's horn is a key feature of Rosh Hashanah - but extra care must be taken this year The government has issued highly detailed dos and don'ts for the UK Jewish community as it celebrates its most important festivals of the year. Rosh Hashanah, Yom Kippur and Sukkot normally involve packed synagogues and large family gatherings. This year, synagogues will have to ensure social distancing and avoid communal prayer shawls and books. The person blowing the shofar (ram's horn) for Rosh Hashanah should keep 2m from other worshippers. Hope for better times as festivals begin Beginning on Friday, the three-week period known as the Days of Awe is the central feature of the Jewish religious year, but many of its traditions will be impossible this year. A long checklist,externalmakes clear that synagogues can be used as long as Covid secure measures are in place. 'Religion helped me through lockdown' What are the changes to places of worship? What is the future of religious worship in the UK? But communal prayer books and prayer shawls, normally strewn around the synagogue, must be removed with worshippers told to bring their own prayer books. Microphones should be used where possible, though these would normally be unacceptable in orthodox synagogues. Mask-wearing is advised, and people should not mix in groups of more than six in line with the new limits on social gatherings. SOCIAL DISTANCING:What are the rules now? SCHOOLS:What will happen if children catch coronavirus? LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? YOUR QUESTIONS:We answer your queries The guidance acknowledges that the ""rule of six"" will have a particular impact on the tradition of hospitality around Sukkot - the Feast of Tabernacles, which marks the end of harvest and commemorates the Exodus from Egypt. Running from 2 October to 9 October this year, the festival normally involves constructing ""sukkah"" the little shelter many Jews build in their gardens to eat in during the eight-day Succot festival. Normally guests would be invited and crammed inside, but now the limit is six people - unless the social bubble is bigger than that. Sharing food or cutlery is out, as are social gatherings in a communal sukkah and ""sukkah crawls"" across the community. A central feature of Rosh Hashanah - the Jewish New Year - is the blowing of the shofar, a musical instrument made from a ram's horn that may present a risk for a virus spread through droplets. To reduce the risk, the guidance says the shofar blower must be at least 2m from anyone else, and it should not be blown towards anyone. There is also detailed guidance for a ceremony known as Tashlich, where on Rosh Hashanah worshippers go to a body of moving water like a river and figuratively throw away their sins. This video can not be played Losing a âbeacon of lightâ of the UKâs ultra-Orthodox community to coronavirus As well as the rule of six and social distancing, the guidance says items used during the ceremony should not be shared, such as prayer books or the breadcrumbs that some worshippers cast on the water. Meanwhile, the Prince of Wales has been appointed patron of a Jewish youth organisation as it celebrates in 125th year. Neil Martin, chief executive of the JLGB (Jewish Lads' and Girls' Brigade), said it is an ""absolute honour"" and praised the prince as ""a tremendous believer in the power of young people"".

"Stricter restrictions barring household visits in the west of Scotland have been extended for another week. The measures cover 1.75 million people living in and around Glasgow. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon urged everyone living in the areas to follow the rules in a bid to ""get more control over the virus"". The restrictions apply in Glasgow city, East and West Dunbartonshire, North and South Lanarkshire, Renfrewshire, and East Renfrewshire. People living in the seven areas are not allowed to host others inside their home, or visit anyone else's home anywhere in Scotland. The announcement comes on the same day that lockdown restrictions across the country were tightened, with gatherings now restricted to a maximum of six people from two households. New rules limit social gatherings to six people Sturgeon seeks 'urgent' talks over testing backlog The Scottish government said reported cases of Covid-19 were higher than average in the seven council areas, although an ""early assessment"" had suggested the tougher measures were ""working to slow the increase in cases"". The first minister said it was ""clearly regrettable"" that the restrictions would have to continue, but said ""we must act to get more control over the virus in these areas"". Ms Sturgeon said: ""I would ask everyone in the affected areas to continue being extra vigilant, to follow all guidance and to isolate and book a test if they have any symptoms. Do not lose ground now."" The only exception to the bar on indoor meetings is for those in extended households, while only essential indoor visits are being permitted in hospitals and care homes. People from two different households are still allowed to meet up outdoors and in hospitality settings, as long as groups do not exceed six and wider guidance around hygiene and physical distancing is followed. The local restrictions will be reviewed again on Tuesday 22 September. The rules, which had already covered Glasgow city, East and West Dunbartonshire, Renfrewshire, and East Renfrewshire, wereextended to cover Lanarkshireon Friday. On Saturday, those seven areas had the highest rates of new Covid-19 cases in Scotland.

"The torch relay toured the UK for 70 days ahead of the London 2012 Olympic Games An automotive firm that made the 2012 London Olympic torch has gone into liquidation. Premier Sheet Metals said it blamed ""conditions within the automotive sector which were further compounded by the onset of Covid-19"". Based in Exhall, Warwickshire, the firm said a fall in sales had affected its cash flow and could no longer trade. It produces sheet metal parts for the automotive sector, which has been struggling throughout the pandemic. The first six months of the year saw the number of cars built in the UKslump to the lowest level since 1954. Premier Sheet Metals alsomade the 8,000 torches used in the relay that marked the opening of the 2012 games. A spokesman for the firm said despite ""substantial cash injections"", extra funding could not be secured, ""largely due to the absence of any certainty in the marketplace"". ""Following a review of the company's financial position and cashflow requirements by the company's advisors, it became apparent that Premier Sheet Metal (Coventry) Ltd could not generate sufficient sales and in turn cash flow to enable it to continue to trade,"" he added.

"The information was online for 20 hours before being taken down The details of more than 18,000 people who tested positive for coronavirus were published online by mistake by Public Health Wales. The health body said the data of 18,105 Welsh residents was viewable online for 20 hours on 30 August. Most cases gave initials, date of birth, geographical area and sex, meaning the risk of identification was low, Public Health Wales (PHW) said. However 1,928 people in living in communal settings were more at risk. Nursing home residents or those living in supported housing also had the name of their place of residence published, meaning the risk, while still considered low, was higher. The incident was the result of ""individual human error"" when the information was uploaded to a public server searchable by anyone using the site. PHW said the information had been viewed 56 times before it was removed but there was no evidence so far that the data had been misused. Anyone with concerns can contact Public Health Wales for help Chief executive Tracey Cooper told BBC Wales the failure was one of the ""biggest data breaches"" she had come across and said it ""should never have happened"". Dr Cooper also said Public Health Wales could have acted more quickly in removing the information. The person who was alerted to the breach on the evening of 30 August after the information was posted at 14:00 that day did not follow the body's serious incident reporting procedures. The data was not removed until 09:55 the next morning. Finding out why is part of the terms of reference of an external investigation which will be carried out by NHS Wales Informatics Service. ""I think we should have taken it down quicker,"" she said. Tracey Cooper said it was one of the biggest data breaches she had come across The team that ""takes data protection responsibilities extremely seriously"" was ""devastated that this has happened"", Ms Cooper said. ""I can't apologise enough because on this occasion we failed."" Dr Cooper said she was not considering resigning, saying: ""I'm the person who is accountable and as chief executive that's where the buck stops. ""I want to get to the bottom of it so I'm not at this stage [considering my position]."" PHW said it had already taken steps, including making sure any data uploads were now undertaken by a senior team member. Welsh Conservative spokesman on health, Andrew RT Davies MS, said: ""I acknowledge that the risk is considered to be 'low', but I'm not sure that that will be much comfort to the nearly 2,000 residents of care homes or other enclosed settings whose - albeit limited - information was posted along with their place of residence. ""The health minister appears to have sat on this for two weeks and done a press conference earlier today without disclosing this significant failing - and that's unacceptable."" His Plaid Cymru counterpart, Rhun ap Iorwerth MS, said: ""Any data breach is serious, and this data breach including potential means of identifying patients is of serious concern. ""Public Health Wales and the Welsh Government have to be able to explain how exactly this happened, and give assurances that this can't happen again."" The Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) and the Welsh Government have been informed. The ICO said it would be making inquires following the alert. This is the second time a part of the Welsh NHS has had to refer itself to the ICO over a data breach during the pandemic. In April, NHS Wales Informatics Services - the health service's IT arm - contacted the watchdog after 13,000 shielding letters were sent to the wrong addresses. Anyone concerned that their data or that of a close family member could have been published can get advice fromPublic Health Wales,external.

"This video can not be played Sir Keir Starmer calls for âurgent talksâ to set up ânew targeted supportâ when the furlough scheme ends Sir Keir Starmer has called on the government to replace the furlough scheme and outlaw ""firing and re-hiring"" methods to avoid the ""scarring effect"" of ""mass unemployment"". Almost 10 million workers have been furloughed since March but the scheme is set to end on 31 October. The Labour leader made an ""open offer"" to work on a plan with the PM including targeted support for badly-hit sectors. Chancellor Rishi Sunak said he would be ""creative"" in helping people find work. He told Cabinet it was his ""top priority"", but said that ""indefinitely keeping people out of work is not the answer"". However, Employment Minister Mims Davies hinted there could be a more targeted approach when Chancellor Rishi Sunak unveils his budget later in the year. She said there would be ""sectors that take longer to come back"" from the pandemic, adding: ""I don't think this government is afraid of supporting where we can [and we] have fiscal events where the chancellor can start to look at that."" Sir Keir's speech at this year's Trades Union Congress' annual conference comes as the latest UK unemployment figures are released, showingthe highest level for two years. The unemployment rate grew to 4.1% in the three months to July - compared with 3.9% previously - with young people were particularly hard hit. Will the furlough scheme be extended? Could UK adopt German or French scheme? TUC warns Chancellor 'act or face job loss tsunami' Sir Keir made the case for replacing the job retention scheme - also known as the furlough scheme - which was introduced to support employers and staff during the coronavirus lockdown. Under it, employees placed on leave due to virus restrictions have received 80% of their pay up to a maximum of Â£2,500 a month. Since September, firms have had to start making a contribution to wages as part of the scheme winding down. The government has been reluctant to extend the furlough scheme beyond October with Boris Johnson arguing that it would only keep people ""in suspended animation"". Speaking to the conference via Zoom while isolating at home, Sir Keir said: ""We all know the furlough scheme can't go on as it is forever, but the truth is the virus is still with us and infections are increasing. ""It just isn't possible to get back to work or reopen businesses. It isn't a choice. It's the cold reality of this crisis. ""So it makes no sense at all for the government to pull support away now in one fell swoop."" The Labour leader said the government should hold urgent talks with his party, trade unions and businesses, and use a ""bit of imagination"" to create ""new targeted support that can replace the job retention scheme and develop those sectors where it is most needed"" - such as retail, hospitality and aviation. ""Imagine how powerful it would be if we all shared a national plan to protect jobs, create new ones and invest in skills and trade,"" he added. ""So I'm making an open offer to the prime minister: work with us to keep millions of people in work, work with the trade unions, work with businesses and do everything possible to protect jobs and deliver for workers. My door is open."" Politically, Keir Starmer's language was at least as interesting as his post-furlough policies. First, his call for a ""national plan"" and his offer of an ""open door"" to government. He is attempting to appear as a consensus-builder, and placing responsibility for any lack of engagement on Boris Johnson. This is felt to be a more effective tactic than unadulterated criticism - offering potential solutions as well as pointing out problems. It has caused teeth-gnashing amongst some on his party's left, however. Second, and perhaps more significantly, was the language he used to encase a commitment that Jeremy Corbyn could have made. The re-hiring of employees on worse conditions was ""against British values"" and hit those who worked hard he said and should be banned. This terminology is aimed at those residing amidst the ruins of the red wall, presenting left-wing positions that might appeal to them as ""patriotic"". The question for the future is how far Keir Starmer will feel he has to change previous Labour policies rather than to re-badge them. Other proposals from Labour include expanding part-time working and rewarding employers who give people hours rather than cut jobs, and providing training and support for those who can't come back full-time. ""We know only too well the scarring effect massive mass unemployment will have on communities and families across the country,"" Sir Keir added. ""We cannot let that happen again."" The Labour leader praised trade unions as ""unsung heroes"" saying: ""Without you there would have been no furlough scheme, no life raft for seven million people."" And he pledged to ""stand together"" with the unions under his leadership. During questions from union members, Sir Keir also called for a ""different approach"" to the care sector, which he said had been ""underpaid and undervalued"" for years. And asked about the return to workplaces, he criticised the government communications for ""being all over the place"" but said going back safely was ""in the best interest of everybody and in the best interests of the country"".

"Planet Venus: The phosphine is detected at mid-latitudes It's an extraordinary possibility - the idea that living organisms are floating in the clouds of Planet Venus. But this is what astronomers are now considering after detecting a gas in the atmosphere they can't explain. That gas is phosphine - a molecule made up of one phosphorus atom and three hydrogen atoms. On Earth, phosphine is associated with life, with microbes living in the guts of animals like penguins, or in oxygen-poor environments such as swamps. For sure, you can make it industrially, but there are no factories on Venus; and there are certainly no penguins. So why is this gas there, 50km up from the planet's surface? Prof Jane Greaves, from Cardiff University, UK and colleagues are asking just this question. They've publisheda paper in the journal Nature Astronomy,externaldetailing their observations of phosphine at Venus, as well as the investigations they've made to try to show this molecule could have a natural, non-biological origin. But for the moment, they're stumped - as they tell the BBC's Sky At Night programme, which has talked at length to the team.You can see the show on BBC Four tonight (Monday) at 22:30 BST. Given everything we know about Venus and the conditions that exist there, no-one has yet been able to describe an abiotic pathway to phosphine, not in the quantities that have been detected. This means a life source deserves consideration. ""Through my whole career I have been interested in the search for life elsewhere in the Universe, so I'm just blown away that this is even possible,"" Prof Greaves said. ""But, yes, we are genuinely encouraging other people to tell us what we might have missed. Our paper and data are open access; this is how science works."" Will private firms win the race to Venus? This video can not be played How corrosive is sulphuric acid? Dr William Bains shows Sky At Night's Chris Lintott Prof Greaves' team first identified phosphine at Venus using the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope in Hawaii, and then confirmed its presence using the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array in Chile. Phosphine has a distinctive ""absorption line"" that these radio telescopes discern at a wavelength of about 1mm. The gas is observed at mid-latitudes on the planet at roughly 50-60km in altitude. The concentration is small - making up only 10-20 parts in every billion atmospheric molecules - but in this context, that's a lot. The phosphine molecule is made up of one phosphorus atom and three hydrogen atoms Venus is not at the top of the list when thinking of life elsewhere in our Solar System. Compared to Earth, it's a hellhole. With 96% of the atmosphere made up of carbon dioxide, it has experienced a runaway greenhouse effect. Surface temperatures are like those in a pizza oven - over 400C. Space probes that have landed on the planet have survived just minutes before breaking down. And yet, go 50km up and it's actually ""shirtsleeves conditions"". So, if there really is life on Venus, this is exactly where we might expect to find it. Artwork: Venus is envisioned as a hellish world, an unlikely candidate to host life The clouds. They're thick and they're mainly composed (75-95%) of sulphuric acid, which is catastrophic for the cellular structures that make up living organisms on Earth. Dr William Bains, who's affiliated to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in the US, is a biochemist on the team. He's studied various combinations of different compounds expected to be on Venus; he's examined whether volcanoes, lightning and even meteorites could play a role in making PH3 - and all of the chemical reactions he's investigated, he says, are 10,000 times too weak to produce the amount of phosphine that's been observed. To survive the sulphuric acid, Dr Bains believes, airborne Venusian microbes would either have to use some unknown, radically different biochemistry, or evolve a kind of armour. ""In principle, a more water-loving life could hide itself away inside a protective shell of some sorts inside the sulphuric acid droplets,"" he told Sky At Night. ""We're talking bacteria surrounding themselves by something tougher than Teflon and completely sealing themselves in. But then how do they eat? How do they exchange gases? It's a real paradox."" The Soviet probes that landed survived just long enough to radio back a handful of pictures Cautious and intrigued. The team emphatically is not claiming to have found life on Venus, only that the idea needs to be further explored as scientists also hunt down any overlooked geological or abiotic chemical pathways to phosphine. Oxford University's Dr Colin Wilson worked on the European Space Agency's Venus Express probe (2006-2014), and is a leading figure in the development of a new mission concept called EnVision. He said Prof Greaves' observations would spur a new wave of research at the planet. ""It's really exciting and will lead to new discoveries - even if the original phosphine detection were to turn out to be a spectroscopic misinterpretation, which I don't think it will. I think that life in Venus' clouds today is so unlikely that we'll find other chemical pathways of creating phosphine in the atmosphere - but we'll discover lots of interesting things about Venus in this search,"" he told BBC News. Prof Lewis Dartnell from the University of Westminster is similarly cautious. He's an astrobiologist - someone who studies the possibilities of life beyond Earth. He thinks Mars or the moons of Jupiter and Saturn are a better bet to find life. ""If life can survive in the upper cloud-decks of Venus - that's very illuminating, because it means maybe life is very common in our galaxy as a whole. Maybe life doesn't need very Earth-like planets and could survive on other, hellishly-hot, Venus-like planets across the Milky Way."" The phosphine signal was confirmed by the ALMA telescope facility in Chile By sending a probe to investigate specifically the atmosphere of Venus. The US space agency (Nasa) asked scientists recently to sketch the design for a potential flagship mission in the 2030s. Flagships are the most capable - and most expensive - ventures undertaken by Nasa. This particular concept proposed an aerobot, or instrumented balloon, to travel through the clouds of Venus. ""The Russians did this with their Vega balloon (in 1985),"" said team-member Prof Sara Seager from MIT. ""It was coated with Teflon to protect it from sulphuric acid and floated around for a couple of days, making measurements. ""We could definitely go make some in-situ measurements. We could concentrate the droplets and measure their properties. We could even bring a microscope along and try to look for life itself."" Artwork: One of the best ways to resolve the uncertainty would be with instrumented balloons The Sky At Night special on this story can be seen at 22:30 on BBC Four,and afterwards on the BBC iPlayer.

"Dr David Hepburn was one of the first NHS doctors to become ill with Covid-19 New rules to curb a rise in the number of coronavirus cases could be ""shutting the door after the horse has bolted"", an intensive care doctor has warned. David Hepburn, from the Royal Gwent Hospital, was one of the first NHS doctors to become ill with Covid-19. He said he feared a second wave had already started and could last six months amida rise in cases in Newport linked to pubs and clubs in the city. Health Minister Vaughan Gething said closing such venues was an option. Mr Gething said if people's behaviour does not change Wales could face a national lockdown within seven weeks' time. Newport spike blamed on bank holiday weekend party Dr Hepburn's warning comes as the BMA warned that doctors' greatest fear was a ""very likely"" second wave. Speaking to BBC Radio Wales Breakfast, Dr Hepburn said there was ""definitely a sense that things are ramping up again"", likening it to the situation in February ""before we started to get active cases in March"". ""It is worth emphasising there are patients in hospital in south Wales with Covid and it is only a matter of time before we start getting patients sick enough to end up with us [in intensive care],"" he told Oliver Hides. Public Health Wales has named a number of pubs and bars in Newport where cases have been confirmed New rules came into force in Wales on Monday, mandating the wearing of masks in shops and other indoor public spaces, and banning indoor meetings of more than six people from an extended household. On Monday, Pembrokeshire council asked care homes for older people in the county to suspend all non-essential indoor visits from Tuesday. It said it was a precautionary measure to help keep residents as safe as possible. Visits to care homes have already beenstopped in Rhondda Cynon Taffand Caerphilly. The changes come after,externalto avoid followingCaerphilly into a local lockdown, with Wales' First Minister Mark Drakeford warning Covid-19 was ""on the rise again"" as 20 people in 100,000 had the virus. ""Modelling always showed a double peak or a triple peak distribution,"" Dr Hepburn continued. ""There is still time if people obey the rules, wear masks and try to stay apart. We know that being outdoors is much better than being indoors, so if we have to meet up with someone you are much better doing it outdoors. ""We can turn it around, but I have a terrible feeling now we are shutting the door after the horse has bolted, and this increased activity at the minute is going to translate into another big wave for us in critical care in the next four to six weeks, which would be a shame."" At its peak, 49 patients were critically ill on ventilators at the Royal Gwent Hospital's intensive care unit in Newport - the unit's usual maximum capacity being 14 - withDr Hepburn comparing it with ""scenes from a science fiction film"". 86% of doctors and medical students who took part in a survey said they fear a ""very likely"" second wave Dr Hepburn said if it was the start of a second wave it could last longer than the first wave because it was happening before the winter months when cases were expected to rise as people move indoors. ""It was fairly acute last time - it was all over by May, June last time,"" he explained. ""But if we see a big surge in hospital admissions this time, it could last for six months which would be a big problem."" He added: ""There was always going to be a natural ramping up but the question is now whether behaviour modification and whether people pulling together locally to avoid a big surge will work, and I really hope it does because I can tell you this now, I'm really not looking forward to going through it again."" The British Medical Association (BMA) has reported 86% of doctors and medical students who responded to a survey said a second peak was likely or very likely in the next six months. ""The survey results expose the greatest fears of doctors in Wales - fears borne out of their everyday experiences of treating patients with Covid-19 and witnessing the dramatic impact of the virus on the NHS,"" said Dr David Bailey, BMA Cymru Wales council chairman. ""As a profession, and I'm sure as a nation, we do not wish to return to the scenes we saw earlier in the year, where hospitals were full with Covid-19 patients, many people dying every day."" Health Minister Vaughan Gething said he would be willing to impose a national lockdown in Wales, even if other parts of the UK do not Mr Gething said he was waiting to see the results of recent testing in Newport, Rhondda Cynon Taff and Merthyr Tydfil before deciding whether local measures were needed. He said he could not rule out a national lockdown in Wales, even if other parts of the UK do not. Later at a press conference he added: ""If there isn't a change in behaviour we could well be not just seven weeks away from a potential national lockdown, but a lot quicker."" ""If we see cases continue to riseâ¦ then we may be in a position to make that decision and need to make that decision sooner than the seven week period of time.""

"People should report their neighbours for any suspected breaches of new ""rule of six"" limits on social gatherings, the crime minister has said. Kit Malthouse urged residents to pass on details of suspected law-breaking through non-emergency numbers. From today, new rules restrict indoor and outdoor gatherings in England and Scotland, and indoor groups in Wales. They come after the UK'sreproduction, or R, number escalatedto between one and 1.2 for the first time since March. There were a further 2,621 confirmed cases of coronavirus in the UK on Monday, a fall after three consecutive days with more than 3,000 positive tests. But there have been widespread concerns about the availability of testing. Nine more deaths were reported within 28 days of a positive test. What are the new rules? Why is the R number so important? 'We've got four kids so can't see anyone else' Asked on BBC Radio 4's Today programme whether a person should report a gathering of seven or more in a neighbour's garden, Mr Malthouse said: ""It is open to neighbours to do exactly that through the non-emergency number. ""And if they are concerned and they do see that kind of thing, then absolutely they should think about it."" The crime and policing minister added there were ""discussions about what reporting mechanisms there might be, but there is obviously the non-emergency number (101) that people can ring and report issues they wish to"". National Police Chiefs' Council (NPCC) chairman Martin Hewitt denied that enforcement of the rule of six relied on people ""grassing up"" their neighbours. ""It relies on all of us being responsible,"" he told BBC Breakfast. BBC home affairs correspondent Daniel Sandford said guidance to police forces in England on how to enforce the new rule was not yet ready, so people were unlikely to be fined for a few days. Meanwhile, Prof Bobby Duffy, director of King's College London's policy institute, told the BBC that one in 20 people said in a survey of attitudes during the pandemic that they had reported others for rule breaches. Social gatheringsof more than six peoplein England, Scotland and Wales will not be allowed in lawfrom Monday 14 Septemberwith some exceptions The new ruleapplies to people in private homes, indoors and outdoors, and places such as pubs, restaurants, cafes and public outdoor spaces In Scotland, the rule appliesto a maximum of two householdsand in Wales it applies tothe same extended household Itapplies to all agesin England, but not to those aged12 and under in Scotland, and thoseunder 11 in Walesin those households The ruledoes not apply to schools, universities and workplaces, or weddings, funerals and organised team sports A full list of exemptionshas beenpublished in England,external Peoplewho ignore policecould be fined Â£100 - doubling with each offence to a maximum of Â£3,200 Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer told LBC he backed the rules, adding: ""You can make the argument of why not five or why not six or seven - you have to go with a number backed by the science and they say six, and I think we should abide by that rule."" Later, it was announced Sir Keir would self-isolate, after a family membershowed possible coronavirus symptoms. The new rules come into force amid reports that the UK's testing systems are overwhelmed, withScotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon expressing ""serious concern""over what she described as a backlog of results in the lab network. Alice Wiseman, Gateshead's director of public heath, told the BBC local authorities had requested a mobile testing unit on Saturday, only to see it arrive a day late with dozens of people directed elsewhere for tests. ""We're not able to do contact tracing unless we have a positive result,"" she said. ""In theory, there are potentially people walking around with Covid who just don't know."" Doris-Ann Williams, chief executive of laboratory testing industry body the British In Vitro Diagnostic Association, said delays to testing were being caused by a lack of staff and they were ""trying to desperately recruit more"" to increase capacity for the winter. Police in Bristol spoke to one mum at a toddler's picnic with seven people As the new law on gatherings came into force, police in Bristol were soon explaining the changes to confused members of the public. One mum was told her toddler's picnic - a group of seven - was now illegal. ""It's very difficult to understand though, if I'm allowed to be in a pub with a group of people a metre apart but I can't be with my kids' friends,"" she replied to the officer. Another woman, Nicky, said she thought her gathering of more than six was allowed because the children all attended school together. Groups like this would be allowed in nearby Wales and in Scotland, where children do not count towards the total. ""We could just go over the bridge and be with a much larger group of people,"" Nicky said. ""It does feel a bit unfair."" Most people were aware of the changes and kept to groups of six or fewer Elsewhere, the new rule brought hobbies and clubs to a halt. Jacky Wadsworth, secretary of Rockingham Brass Band in South Yorkshire, said their 28-person band was like a ""second family"" but now members would not be able to meet at the same time. They had hired a larger hall to allow for social distancing, but the new rules meant ""we are back to square one"". The ""rule of six"" in England - hailed as ""super simple"" by Health Secretary Matt Hancock - replaces guidance on allowing two households to meet indoors and a previous ban on gatherings which exceeded 30 people. Under the changes, larger gatherings are still allowed at gyms, schools, places of worship, weddings and funerals. Education and work settings are not affected. And new details of exemptions,externalpublished on Monday revealed that shooting, yachting and ultimate frisbee were among the sports that could continue in groups of more than six. Some Tory MPshave also urged No 10to exempt young children in England and called for a debate over the rules. TESTING:What tests are available? SYMPTOMS:What are they and how to guard against them? LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? TEST AND TRACE:How does it work? Groups larger than six can be broken up by police, with members of the group facing fines of Â£100 for a first offence, doubling on each further offence up to Â£3,200. But it emerged that fewer than half of people fined under existing coronavirus regulations in England and Wales had paid their penalties. A letter from the Attorney General,external, written on 25 August and published last week, said 46% of more than 19,000 fines issued were past the deadline for payment and could be considered for prosecution. In other developments: the government's chief scientific adviser sayshe was rebuked by other senior officials for arguing strongly in favour of a lockdownbefore it was imposed in March Downing Street said that about 99% of schools expected to reopen had done so, with only a ""very small number"" asking some pupils to stay at home due to outbreaks a new antibody treatment is to be trialledon Covid-19 patients in UK hospitals a ban on household visits affecting 1.75m people in Glasgow and the west of Scotland is to beextended for another week a British Medical Association survey of 8,000 doctors and medical students suggested a second peak of Covid-19 was their number one concern pub chain JD Wetherspoon insisted its venues were safe after it confirmed 66 of its workershad tested positive for coronavirus THE RULE OF SIX:What's in the small print?

"Schools worked hard to get ready for the new term - but there are worries about lack of access to testing Schools in England are being ""severely hampered"" by delays in Covid tests for teachers, say head teachers. Jules White, organiser of the WorthLess? network of over 5,000 heads, says there is growing frustration at the lack of access to testing. This means teachers have to isolate and that ""serious staff shortages"" could force partial closures in school. But a government spokeswoman said ""testing capacity is the highest it has ever been"". Mr White, a West Sussex head teacher whose group grew out of a school funding campaign, has written to England's Education Secretary Gavin Williamson to warn of disruption from delays in Covid testing. He warns that efforts to get pupils back for the autumn term are being seriously undermined by a ""test and trace system that is simply not working effectively enough"".Â The group of head teachers, across 75 local authorities, warns that schools are struggling to cope with teachers not being able to get quickly tested for Covid-19 and find out whether they can get back to the classroom. Isolating teachers are still teaching via video School closes as pupil tests positive for Covid-19 Year group sent home to isolate after Covid case The head teachers say this is leaving staff in isolation and ""out of action"". The letter warns that schools need to help pupils catch up and get ready for exams next year - and instead the lack of staff could mean even more lost lesson time. Pupils are back in schools but they face safety measures against the spread of Covid-19 They also warn this uncertainty about Covid cases could be further compounded by seasonal ""coughs and colds"" - and that urgent action is needed on testing, rather than ""vague promises"". ""It is beyond frustration that we are now seeing teachers and support staff being unable to attend work because they cannot get a test or the results from it are far too slow,"" said Mr White. ""Time after time, schools are doing their utmost to support the national effort and time after time, we are left confounded by a lack of effective support from government."" Tehmina Hashmi, head of Bradford Academy in West Yorkshire, who is supporting the letter, warns of the confusion facing her school community over testing. ""It feels really tense in Bradford,"" she says, with parents reporting they cannot get Covid tests. Ms Hashmi says after working hard to get the school ready through the summer, there is great ""frustration"" at what she says has been ""inept leadership"" over Covid testing. Last week Geoff Barton, leader of the ASCL head teachers' union, said teachers were struggling to get tests locally and were being directed to testing sites hundreds of miles away. An academy trust leader has called for a more ""robust strategy"" to help schools facing Covid cases among pupils or staff - as more schools are going to face disruption. Steve Chalke, chief executive of the Oasis academy trust, said that several of the trust's school have already had to send home year groups, affecting about 1,200 pupils. He says that Covid testing needed to be available on the school site and results needed to be turned around quickly - and that eventually there would need to be routine, daily testing. Mr Chalke argued that it would be better to accept the need for a planned rota system, with pupils switching between school and online learning at home, rather than having a ""rotation system by default"" each time a case was discovered. He is also calling for a more ""credible"" approach to how next year's exam season will operate in a fair way and wants a big increase in the pupil premium, which provides schools with extra funding for disadvantaged pupils. A government spokeswoman said that testing levels have increased - ""but we are seeing a significant demand for tests. It is vital that children and school staff only get a test if they develop coronavirus symptoms"". ""If a positive case is confirmed in a school, swift action is being taken to ask those who have been in close contact to self-isolate, and Public Health England's local health protection teams continue to support and advise schools in this situation,"" said the government spokeswoman. ""Children who are self-isolating will receive remote education. We will continue to work with schools to ensure all appropriate steps are taken to keep pupils and staff safe.""

"German carmaker Daimler, which owns Mercedes-Benz, has agreed to pay $1.5bn (Â£1.2bn) to resolve US government claims that it designed its diesel vehicles to cheat air pollution tests. The firm was investigated for installing software to evade emissions laws in 250,000 Mercedes cars and vans. US officials said they hoped the fine would deter future misbehaviour. Daimler called the deal an ""important step"" towards resolving diesel proceedings but denied the claims. ""By resolving these proceedings, Daimler avoids lengthy court actions with respective legal and financial risks,"" the company said. In addition to the $1.5bn settlement with US authorities, Daimler said it had agreed to pay $700m to settle a class action lawsuit brought by owners. It also disclosed ""further expenses of a mid three-digit-million EUR amount to fulfil requirements of the settlements."" The deals, which Daimler had said it was nearing last month, conclude an investigation that the US started in 2016, after ""defeat devices"" were discovered through testing. Officials said that an $875m fine included in the $1.5bn settlement with authorities is the second-largest civil penalty the US has ever imposed under its Clear Air Act and the largest if measured on a per-vehicle basis. Daimler has also agreed to fix the affected cars, which were sold between 2009 and 2016, at no cost to their owners. US officials said that commitment was worth about $400m. At a press conference on Monday, Andrew Wheeler, the head of the US Environmental Protection Agency, said: ""The message we are sending today is clear: We will enforce the law. ""If you try to cheat the system and mislead the public, you will be caught. Those whoÂ violate public trust in pursuit of profits will forfeit both."" The penalties are the latest in a wide-ranging scandal that has cast a cloud over the motor industry since 2015, whenVolkswagen admitted to installing secret softwareon vehicles sold in the US. The system allowed the cars to emit up to 40 times legally permitted emissions and evade detection during tests. Volkswagen later admitted the devices affected more than 11 million vehicles globally. The company more than $20bn to resolve claims in the US alone. But investigations soon widened to other companies, including Ford, Mitsubishi, and Nissan. Fiat offices raided over diesel emissions claims Lawsuit alleges defeat devices in Nissan petrol cars Volkswagen: The scandal explained In 2018, Daimler recalled more than 700,000 vehicles in Europethat had ""defeat devices"" installed. BMW and Porsche have also recalled cars over the issue. Fiat Chrysler in Europe were raided this summer over the matter. The firm agreed to an estimated$800m settlement,externalto resolve civil claims in the US in January. Daimler said the US settlement concerned vehicles that were not sold in the same configurations in Europe.

"US tech firm Oracle has confirmed that TikTok's owner has formally proposed it become a ""trusted technology partner"" to the video-sharing app. Full details of the tie-up have yet to be disclosed, but the aim is to avoid President Trump's threat to shut down the Chinese-owned service in the US. Mr Trump has cited national security concerns, suggesting users' data could be accessed by Beijing under current arrangements. Current owner Bytedance denies this. It says it has taken,external""extraordinary measures to protect the privacy and security of TikTok's US user data"", which is stored in the States and Singapore. Oracle is a database specialist without experience of running a social media app targeted at the general public. Earlier in the day, US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said that the Trump administration had been contacted by the American firm to discuss plans to make TikTok a US-headquartered company. He said the White House intended to review the idea this week. Microsoft had also attempted to buy the platform, butrevealed it had been rejected on Sunday,external. TikTok has released a statement that does not make direct reference to Oracle. ""We can confirm that we've submitted a proposal to the Treasury Department which we believe would resolve the administration's security concerns,"" it said. ""This proposal would enable us to continue supporting our community of 100 million people in the US who love TikTok for connection and entertainment, as well as the hundreds of thousands of small business owners and creators who rely upon TikTok to grow their livelihoods and build meaningful careers."" Oracle's shares were trading about 5% higher in lunchtime trade in New York. ""While I can see the upside for Oracle from a cloud perspective, it is hard not to think how much of this deal rests on politics rather than tech,"" commented Carolina Milanesi from the Silicon Valley-based research firm Creative Strategies. Oracle's chairman, the billionaire Larry Ellison, is a supporter of Mr Trump and in February held a fundraiser at his California home to aid the Republican leader's re-election campaign. The White House is also taking a harsh line against other Chinese tech companies - including Huawei, Tencent and a number of artificial intelligence start-ups - restricting what business they can do with US counterparts without the administration's approval. President Trump had given TikTok's owner Bytedance until this week to secure a deal. What is Oracle and why does it want TikTok? TikTok rejects Microsoft bid at eleventh hour Chinese chip giant 'in shock' after US trade ban threat Failure to do so would have seen US companies prevented from doing business with it from Sunday, and Bytedance being forced to give up TikTok's US operations one way or another by 12 November. The app's US teamsued the US government last monthin an effort to challenge the moves. Oracle was not the favourite to buy or otherwise link up to TikTok's US arm - Microsoft was the early frontrunner. But as time wore on, Microsoft became increasingly concerned about what it would be acquiring. It became clear that China might attempt to block the sale of the technology behind the app's powerful algorithm. Privately there were concerns too that Microsoft was about to create a rod for its own back by becoming involved with a mass market, youth-focused social network - it already owns LinkedIn, but that caters for a very different audience. Political bias, child safety issues and right-wing militias are just some of the problems TikTok has had to deal with in the last few months. Even so, TikTok's hundreds of millions of users make it an attractive proposition in a sector where size is everything: if all your friends are on a platform, you too are more likely to join. Oracle has decided it's worth the risk. The big questions now are what exactly is Oracle's involvement, and will the tie-up be approved by the US and Chinese authorities.

"A picture of Earth taken from a Rocket Lab Photon. The craft will go to Venus in 2023 With astronomers detecting a potential signature of life in the clouds of Venus, there's obviously going to be a big push to get some new space missions to the planet. We don't know if thephosphine gas recently observed by telescopesis coming from floating microbes or has a simple non-biological origin. Right now, nothing is conclusive. But the only way we're likely to find out for sure is by taking some scientific instruments there. The Japanese space agency's Akatsuki orbiter is the one mission at the planet at present, and it was built long before the phosphine question came up â so it's not really best-suited to study the issue. What's needed are some dedicated investigations. And the first opportunity we'll probably get to perform these will be with the private Rocket Lab company. Is there life floating in the clouds of Venus? European and NZ rockets return to action Blast-off for Nasa mission to detect life on Mars This start-up has been making waves with its small Electron rocket, which launches from the Mahia Peninsula in New Zealandâs North Island. The company's CEO, Peter Beck, is fascinated by Venus and has already announced his intention to send a mission there in 2023. He's funding and constructing it in-house. Rocket Lab will do it with the Photon ""kick-stage"" that goes on the top of an Electron. In Earth orbit, this stage does the final placement of small satellites in the part of the sky they want to operate. But the Photon is extremely capable and could shepherd a probe to another planet, and even carry some sensors of its own. Beck's plan is to drop off an atmospheric entry probe at Venus. As this falls through the âairâ, it would radio back its observations of Venusian clouds to the Photon, which in turn would relay that data back to Earth. Peter Beck says Venus deserves a little more love from space missions The entrepreneur's team is working on a payload mass of 37kg. ""That might not sound a lot, but 37kg can get you an awful lot of instrumentation, especially if you're now very targeted in what you're looking for and what you're trying to measure,â Beck told BBC News. ""Venus hasn't had a lot of love recently, and I think 2023 is the opportunity to put that right. It's very hard for governments to move quickly but a private mission can. We can go there for a small amount of money, and we can go there many times and have many goes at it, and iterate the learning."" Rocket Lab's Photon: It will drop off an entry probe to fall through the Venusian atmosphere Itâs true, the big space agencies operate by a different philosophy. They aim for super, high-fidelity science and engineering â but this means their top-notch missions fly infrequently and at high cost. It's a question of trade-offs. A Rocket Lab entry probe when it falls through the atmosphere at Venus is not going to spend long in the key zone where phosphine has been detected â between 50km and 60km in altitude. The measurements will be brief. Ideally, what you need is some sort of long-lived platform, dwelling in the clouds of Venus for weeks or months at a time. Like a balloon. That's the kind of thing big space agencies do. ""This would allow detailed measurement of cloud,"" explains Dr Colin Wilson from Oxford University, UK, who worked on the European Space Agency's Venus Express probe (2006-2014) ""We proposed such a mission â the European Venus Explorer â to Esa in 2010, unsuccessfully. This year, in a Nasa-run Venus Flagship Mission study, we proposed including a balloon that would explore the cloud layer for two months, with specific instruments designed to detect biological material if present."" It's a fantastic idea and follows in the pioneering footsteps of the Soviet Vega balloons at Venus in the 1980s, although they only worked for a couple of days. A Nasa concept study earlier this year proposed a long-lived balloon The problem is that, even if approved for development, we wouldn't see a Nasa Venus flagship mission - and its balloon - fly until the 2030s at the earliest. And the more modest mission concepts now before Nasa and Esa for consideration are looking at launch slots no sooner than the back end of this decade. Which brings us back to the Rocket Lab type of approach if we want quicker results. Prof Jane Greaves from Cardiff University led the team that detected phosphine in the atmosphere at Venus. She hopes scientists can find inventive ways of getting new probes to the planet. âI think in the fairly near-term, we'd like to send even just a really small probe that maybe some other mission could drop off on the way - you know, something going to the Sun. Perhaps it could drop a tiny 'lab on a chip' package through the atmosphere so we can get some new data back."" Peter Beck's message is ""give me a call. If anybody wants to join the team, come join us. But, you know, the bus is leaving; we're going!""

"JD Wetherspoon has said that 66 of its workers have tested positive for the coronavirus but maintains that visiting pubs is safe. The company, which employs more than 41,000 people, said the vast majority of its pubs had recorded no positive tests for the virus. There had been one or more cases among staff at 50 of its pubs. Wetherspoon's boss Tim Martin dismissed claims by disease expert Professor Hugh Pennington that pubs are ""dangerous"". He said: ""The situation with regard to pubs has been widely misunderstood."" Aberdeen University's Prof Pennington said last month that pubs are ""far, far more dangerous places to be"" when discussing sending children back to school during the pandemic. Since reopening on 4 July, the company said some 32 million people have visited its 861 open pubs. What are the rules when I go to the pub? Wetherspoon pubs set out post-lockdown plans Forty of its pubs have reported one worker testing positive for the coronavirus and six have disclosed two. In addition, two pubs reported three staff testing positive and another two said four workers had. A spokesman for Wetherspoon said the pubs have not been closed for a deep clean. The company said it has invested Â£15m in hygiene and social distancing measures at its premises. The spokesman said: ""The advice Wetherspoon has received from the public health authorities is that employees should self-isolate if they come into close contact with someone who has tested positive. Close contact means within 2 metres for 15 minutes or more or 1 metre for 1 minute or more. ""Unless social distancing policies have not been observed, the health authorities, in our experience, do not normally advise closure."" He added that since the company's pubs reopened: ""Staff are conducting regular surface cleaning and numerous hand sanitisers have been installed in each pub."" He said each premises is cleaned throughout trading and at the end of the day. Wetherspoon said 28 of the affected employees had returned to work. A spokesman for the company said the workers, as well as those who worked in close proximity to them, self-isolated for 14 days and were paid in full. The chain said signing up to the NHS track-and-trace system was mandatory in its premises. The company's spokesman said there was no list of the pubs that had been affected. ""Whenever there has been a situation we have dealt with the local press, public health and the council,"" he said. Mr Martin argued that pubs and shops were safer than homes. ""It is much easier to inadvertently pass on the virus in someone's house, where people are more relaxed and less vigilant,"" he said. From Monday, social gatherings of more than six people have been banned both indoors and outdoors in England and Scotland and indoors only in Wales. It follows a rise in new coronavirus cases, with a further 3,330 positive cases recorded in the UK on Sunday. Mr Martin said there had not been a rush of people coming to its pubs before the so-called ""rule of six"" was introduced and trade was 22.5% below the equivalent Saturday last year. He added: ""If pubs are closed, or restricted so much that they become unprofitable, a great deal of the strenuous effort of the hospitality industry's 3.2 million employees, currently engaged on upholding hygiene and social distancing standards, will be lost.""

"Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer is self-isolating after a member of his household ""showed possible symptoms of the coronavirus"", the party has said. The person displaying symptoms has had a test and Sir Keir is now awaiting the results ""in line with NHS guidelines"", they added. The Labour leader will not be speaking inMonday's Commons debate on the government's post-Brexit plans. However, he is not reported to have shown any coronavirus symptoms. Sir Keir - who is due to address the TUC Congress on Tuesday - found out about the concerns over the member of his household following an appearance on LBC radio on Monday morning. A Downing Street spokesman said: ""The prime minister has spoken to the leader of the opposition this morning and gave best wishes to him and his family."" Antibody treatment to be given to Covid patients Report 'rule of six' breaches, urges minister What you can and can't do under today's new rules The coronavirus infection rate is rising across the UK, with rules restricting the size of social gatherings coming into force in England, Scotland and Wales from Monday. A Labour spokesperson said: ""This morning Keir Starmer was advised to self-isolate after a member of his household showed possible symptoms of the coronavirus. ""The member of his household has now had a test. In line with NHS guidelines, Keir will self-isolate while awaiting the results of the test and further advice from medical professionals."" Sir Keir's family secured tests via his wife Victoria's workplace. The hospital where she works, in occupational health, provides on-site testing for staff and their families who have symptoms. The move comes ahead of what was to be one of Sir Keir's most important parliamentary performances since becoming Labour leader in April. Instead shadow business secretary - and former leader - Ed Miliband will open for the party in the debate over the government's Internal Market Bill on Monday afternoon. The legislation attempts tooverride parts of the Brexit withdrawal agreementreached by the UK and EU. Last week, Commons Leader Jacob Rees-Mogg announced he was self-isolating at home after one of his children showed symptoms of coronavirus.

"Nicola Sturgeon has voiced ""very serious concerns"" about an apparent backlog of coronavirus test results. The Scottish first minister said she was seeking ""urgent discussions"" with UK ministers over delays to results. Only 70 new positive cases of the virus were confirmed in Scotland on Monday, compared with 244 on Sunday. Ms Sturgeon said the figures were ""not yet complete"", and suggested that schools going back in England could be causing a spike in demand for tests. Thesystem in Scotland was hit by ""exceptional demand""when pupils returned to schools in August. The Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) said a ""significant"" number of people had been seeking tests, including some ""who do not have symptoms and are not otherwise eligible"" - but that capacity was at its highest level ever. Live: Latest on coronavirus in Scotland New rules limit social gatherings to six people The ""vast bulk"" of Scotland's coronavirus testing is carried out as part of a UK-wide network of test centres and mobile testing units, with the results processed in Lighthouse labs such as the one in Glasgow. Ms Sturgeon said the Scottish government had been ""fully engaged and involved in that system"", and wanted to work ""in partnership with the UK government"" to solve any problems. However, amid reports of a backlog of tests, she said UK ministers needed to ""share the scale and nature of the issues"" so that ""we can collectively and very quickly find solutions"". Ms Sturgeon said: ""We now have a very serious concern that the backlog of test results being faced by the UK lab network is starting to impact on the timeous reporting of Scottish results. ""We have reason to be concerned that the figures that have been reported today are not complete, because some of the turnaround of the tests done in Scotland over yesterday is longer. ""I'll be seeking urgent discussions later today with UK government counterparts just to make sure we are doing everything possible to get on top of this before it becomes a bigger issue."" On Sunday, the DHSC said the Test and Trace system was working and that ""our capacity is the highest it has ever been"". However, it added: ""We are seeing a significant demand for tests, including from people who do not have symptoms and are not otherwise eligible. ""New booking slots and home testing kits are made available daily for those who need them and we are targeting testing capacity at the areas that need it most, including those where there is an outbreak, and prioritising at-risk groups. ""Our laboratories are processing more than a million tests a week and we recently announced new facilities and technology to process results even faster."" At her daily coronavirus briefing, the first minister said Scotland was in a ""precarious situation"". Even with a lower number of positive results on Monday, they still represented 2.7% of people tested. A few weeks ago that figure was usually around or below 1%. Ms Sturgeon said the number of new cases was trebling roughly every three weeks, a pattern which is ""not sustainable"". Newrestrictions on the number of people who can meet upwere imposed on Monday, limiting gatherings to six people from two households. Ms Sturgeon said: ""We have to act now, we have to act quickly to prevent and even greater increase in cases as we go through autumn and into winter.""

"A record one-day rise in the number of new coronavirus cases around the world has been recorded The World Health Organization (WHO) says 307,930 confirmed infections were reported over 24 hours The leader of the UK's Labour party Sir Keir Starmer is self-isolating after a member of his household showed signs of infection Restrictions banning social gatherings of more than six people have come into effect in England and Scotland But Downing Street suggests police will not begin fining people on day one The UK government's chief scientific adviser says he was rebuked for arguing for an earlier lockdown In Marseille, France, officials say they are running out of hospital beds for patients The UAE approves an 'emergency' vaccine for healthcare workers after successful trials Israel has become the first country to announce it will reimpose a second nationwide lockdown later this week Owen Amos That's all from us until tomorrow. Here are some of the key news stories so far today.  The news was brought to you by Ashitha Nagesh, Emma Harrison, Victoria Bisset and Victoria Lindrea. It was edited by Mal Siret and Owen Amos. About 3,000 undertakers in South Africa have gone on strike over pay and working conditions. As part of the strike they're refusing to collect bodies from people's homes and hospitals, and are also not holding burials. Their union wants the government to set up a coronavirus relief fund for the industry. Undertakers have struggled with the increasing cost of burials during the pandemic, because of the need for personal protective equipment (PPE), sanitiser and other extra protective items. But officials say they're worried the strike will cause a significant risk to public health. Macy's department store is making its famous Thanksgiving Day Parade a television-only special presentation, with no in-person spectators, the company said in a joint statement with the City of New York. Instead of going around the traditional 2.5-mile route, this year the parade will be staged solely around the Herald Square area of Midtown Manhattan. The first parade was staged in 1924, and has been a major fixture on the US festive calendar ever since. In recent years, more than 3.5m people have lined the streets each year to watch the parade in person. Faced with a surging coronavirus outbreak and poor working conditions, medical staff from across Morocco have been staging protests over the past few weeks. The country reported a record 2,430 cases last Friday, and has seen more than 1,000 new cases every day since July. Meanwhile, medical unions say some intensive care units are overrun and other wards are full. Morocco's Health Ministry has tried to raise capacity by setting up field hospitals - tents with beds and oxygen - but some medics say the main problem is staff shortages, particularly in rural areas. Anas Qarim, a nurse working at a Covid-19 hospital in Meknes, told Reuters news agency that they had just three nurses and two doctors to treat 120 patients. ""Imagine wearing full protective gear in the summer heat working continuously for hours,"" he said. There could be a second national lockdown in Wales if people fail ""to reconsider the choices we're making"", the health minister has warned. Vaughan Gething warned the pattern of increasing cases was ""similar to the situation we faced in early February"" - and that national lockdown remained an option. The number of new coronavirus cases in Wales increased by 183 on Monday - the largest rise in daily cases since 19 May, bringing the total number of confirmed cases in the country to 19,573. It comes as the government in Wales introduces mandatory face masks in all indoor public spaces and restricts more than six people from an extended household from meeting inside. ""If there isn't a change in behaviour, we could well be not just seven weeks away from a national lockdown, it could potentially be much quicker,"" Mr Gething said. Sameer HashmiMiddle East Business Correspondent, BBC News Volunteers for the phase three trial have come from countries including Egypt The United Arab Emirates government has approved
the use of a Covid-19 vaccine for frontline healthcare workers following
successful clinical trials. The countryâs health minister said the vaccine could be utilised in ""cases of emergency"" involving the
country's healthcare staff. He said the decision came after the phase three trial showed no adverse effects and that the vaccine was able to create antibodies. He added that 31,000 volunteers, representing 125 nationalities, had participated in the clinical trials. China-based Sinopharm CNG has developed
the vaccine and has been conducting the phase three clinical trial along with the

In aletter to parents,external, Stantonbury International School, in Milton Keynes, said all of Year Eight had been ""in close contact"" with the person. It said those pupils and ""a number of teachers"" would have to self-isolate for 14 days. The state-funded academy has about 1,600 pupils; all pupils, except Year Eight, were expected to return by Wednesday. Head teacher Alison Ramsay thanked parents for their ""understanding at this difficult time"".  As we told you earlier, there were a further 2,621 confirmed cases of coronavirus in the UK today - after three consecutive days with more than 3,000 positive tests. It means the seven-day average for daily infections now stands at 3,004. The marked rise in infections over the past week is in keeping with many other countries in Europe, notably Spain and France. Nine more deaths - within 28 days of a positive test - were reported by the UK government on Monday. Deaths remain low - compared to figures at the height of the lockdown in April and May - despite the current spike in infections. On average, there were 12 deaths a day over the past seven days. Six the Musical will be at the Lyric theatre in London from 14 November Everybody's Talking About Jamie and Six will become the first musicals back in London's West End in mid-November, eight months after the curtain came down. They will hit the stage three weeks after a string of non-musical shows reopen London's theatre district. The Play That Goes Wrong, Agatha Christie's The Mousetrap and Adam Kay's This Is Going To Hurt will all admit socially distant audiences in October. Venue bosses said ""robust risk mitigation"" would be in place including reduced capacities, contactless tickets, temperature tests and deep cleans, as well as hand sanitation, face coverings and track and trace.

But where else have cases been surging? Which countries are experiencing a second wave? And what about the US, which remains the country with both the highest number of cases and deaths? In the US, overall, the daily number of new cases is continuing to fall: Some European countries are experiencing second surges of cases of the virus, after getting their outbreaks under control over the summer: A number of countries outside Europe have experienced second surges, too. In Israel, the government is imposing a second national lockdown from Friday in an attempt to control the outbreak: And in some countries, cases have been rising steadily for months: Kat Kingsley said she would be wary of giving her details out again A woman said she was sent ""creepy"" messages by a city bus tour worker who got her details from her test-and-trace form. Kat Kingsley, 25, from Hayle in Cornwall, went on the Original Tour bus in Windsor on Thursday. On Sunday she received two messages from a member of staff at the company saying he wanted to see her. Original Tour said it had launched an investigation as it ""takes the matter extremely seriously"".

All but four of Marseille's intensive care beds are in use, they say, and plans have been made to reallocate resources from other areas to deal with the increase in patients. The authorities have also imposed a number of new restrictions - including making it mandatory to wear masks outdoors in the worst-hit areas, and banning groups of more than 10 from meeting in beaches and parks. Cases have been surging across France. This weekend, the country reporteda single-day increase of more than 10,000 new coronavirus cases. Labour has accused the government of trying to ""exempt the bloodsport passions of their big donors"" from new coronavirus restrictions, after it emerged thatso-called 'rule of six' limitswould not apply to hunting. Government guidelines exempt activities shooting and paintball, as part of a wider exemption for sport that can be done with more than five others. Other activities which are excluded from the ""rule of six"" regulations include team sports such as football, hockey and netball. But shadow environment secretary Luke Pollard said: ""Across the country, people are struggling to get Covid-19 tests anywhere near their homes. ""But the Conservatives are distracted with trying to exempt the bloodsport passions of their big donors from coronavirus regulations. ""It shows where this Government's priorities really lie."" As we reported earlier, the World Health Organization (WHO) has said there has been a record single-day rise in the number of new coronavirus cases. According to the WHO, 307,930 new cases were reported over the past 24 hours. The biggest increases were in India, the US and Brazil. We've put together this chart showing where in the world cases are surging - and falling. Fewer than half of all coronavirus fines handed out in England and Wales since the end of March have been paid so far. Of the 19,171 fines handed out by police for breaching coronavirus restrictions, just 8,930 were paid. Figures published in the letter to the Justice Committee revealed 8,954 fixed penalty notices - 8,325 in England and 629 in Wales - have not been paid within the 28-day payment period, meaning prosecution may follow. Another 1,287 unpaid fines are still pending. Police were given powers to fine people for breaching coronavirus restrictions from 27 March, following the lockdown on 23 March. There have been 2,621 new cases of coronavirus recorded across the UK. It marks a fall of more than 600 cases on Sunday's figures, when 3,330 positive cases were recorded. However weekend figures are often lower, due to delays in reporting. A further nine deaths have been recorded since 09:00 on Sunday, bringing the total reported death toll across the UK to 41,628. A death is anyone who dies within 28 days of testing positive for Covid-19. This video can not be played How not to wear a face mask Does it matter if you wear your face mask wrong? Well, yes. Wearing a face mask or covering incorrectly can make it easier for coronavirus to spread. From today it is compulsory to wear face coverings in shops and indoor places in Wales for everyone aged 11 and over. Face coverings must also be worn in shops, supermarkets and shopping centres in England, Scotland and Northern Ireland. Read

"Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer is self-isolating after a member of his household ""showed possible symptoms of the coronavirus"", the party has said. The person displaying symptoms has had a test and Sir Keir is now awaiting the results ""in line with NHS guidelines"", they added. The Labour leader will not be speaking inMonday's Commons debate on the government's post-Brexit plans. However, he is not reported to have shown any coronavirus symptoms. Sir Keir - who is due to address the TUC Congress on Tuesday - found out about the concerns over the member of his household following an appearance on LBC radio on Monday morning. A Downing Street spokesman said: ""The prime minister has spoken to the leader of the opposition this morning and gave best wishes to him and his family."" Antibody treatment to be given to Covid patients Report 'rule of six' breaches, urges minister What you can and can't do under today's new rules The coronavirus infection rate is rising across the UK, with rules restricting the size of social gatherings coming into force in England, Scotland and Wales from Monday. A Labour spokesperson said: ""This morning Keir Starmer was advised to self-isolate after a member of his household showed possible symptoms of the coronavirus. ""The member of his household has now had a test. In line with NHS guidelines, Keir will self-isolate while awaiting the results of the test and further advice from medical professionals."" Sir Keir's family secured tests via his wife Victoria's workplace. The hospital where she works, in occupational health, provides on-site testing for staff and their families who have symptoms. The move comes ahead of what was to be one of Sir Keir's most important parliamentary performances since becoming Labour leader in April. Instead shadow business secretary - and former leader - Ed Miliband will open for the party in the debate over the government's Internal Market Bill on Monday afternoon. The legislation attempts tooverride parts of the Brexit withdrawal agreementreached by the UK and EU. Last week, Commons Leader Jacob Rees-Mogg announced he was self-isolating at home after one of his children showed symptoms of coronavirus.

People living in the seven areas are not allowed to host others inside their home, or visit anyone else's home anywhere in Scotland. The announcement comes on the same day that lockdown restrictions across the country were tightened, with gatherings now restricted to a maximum of six people from two households. New rules limit social gatherings to six people Sturgeon seeks 'urgent' talks over testing backlog The Scottish government said reported cases of Covid-19 were higher than average in the seven council areas, although an ""early assessment"" had suggested the tougher measures were ""working to slow the increase in cases"". The first minister said it was ""clearly regrettable"" that the restrictions would have to continue, but said ""we must act to get more control over the virus in these areas"". Ms Sturgeon said: ""I would ask everyone in the affected areas to continue being extra vigilant, to follow all guidance and to isolate and book a test if they have any symptoms. Do not lose ground now."" The only exception to the bar on indoor meetings is for those in extended households, while only essential indoor visits are being permitted in hospitals and care homes. People from two different households are still allowed to meet up outdoors and in hospitality settings, as long as groups do not exceed six and wider guidance around hygiene and physical distancing is followed. The local restrictions will be reviewed again on Tuesday 22 September. The rules, which had already covered Glasgow city, East and West Dunbartonshire, Renfrewshire, and East Renfrewshire, wereextended to cover Lanarkshireon Friday. On Saturday, those seven areas had the highest rates of new Covid-19 cases in Scotland. The seven-day rate is calculated by adding up all the new cases over the previous week, then dividing it by the total population of the area. IMPACT:How is the pandemic affecting life in Scotland?

"Illustration of antibodies attacking the coronavirus A new antibody treatment is to be trialled on Covid-19 patients in UK hospitals. Monoclonal antibodies, which are potent, laboratory-made antibodies, will be given to about 2,000 people to see if they are effective against coronavirus. It forms part of the UK Recovery Trial, which found that a cheap steroid called dexamethasone could save lives. The first patients will be given the new drugs in the coming weeks. Prof Martin Landray from the University of Oxford, who is co-leading the Recovery Trial, said: âThis is the first type of treatment that's targeted for this specific virus. âThere are lots of good reasons for thinking it might well be effective - stopping the virus from reproducing, stopping the virus from causing damage, improving survival for patients. âWe need to know, and the way to know is to do the trials that will tell us whether that hope turns into reality.â Antibodies could be described as the ""warriors"" of the immune system. When coronavirus infects your body, antibodies attach to the spikes of the virus, blocking it from entering your cells. But we produce many different types of antibodies - the most potent are called neutralising antibodies. So scientists ""sieve"" through them to find the one thatâs best at sticking to the spike. The chosen antibody is multiplied in the lab, and produced in huge quantities. This is then given to patients, immediately boosting their immune response. This video can not be played The BBC's Rebecca Morelle explains how the monoclonal antibodies work The trial will test a mixture of two monoclonal antibodies made by the US biotech company Regeneron. Both attach to the spike of the virus at slightly different places. So if the virus mutates, and the structure changes, at least one should still work. Regeneron has already produced monoclonal antibodies that can treat Ebola. Leah Lipsich, vice president of the company, said: ""We're hoping that we can springboard from that very effective result against Ebola to something that's just as effective with Covid-19."" The UK Recovery Trial,externalwas set up at the start of the pandemic to identify treatments that could help people admitted to hospital with Covid-19. It has already showed the steroid dexamethasone cuts the risk of death by a third for patients on ventilators, and by a fifth for those on oxygen. Patients will start being given monoclonal antibodies in the next few weeks, and the results will be compared with other patients who have not been given the antibodies. Prof Landray expects that about 2,000 people in each group will be needed to answer key questions. He said: âWe need to understand not only if these treatments work. We also need to understand in whom do they work, and in whom do they work best. âDo they work in people who are older or younger? Do they work in people with more severe or milder disease? Do they work in people only when they're on ventilators or, possibly more likely, before they ever need ventilators?â The results will also be compared with people receiving convalescent plasma, another treatment currently undergoing trials by the Recovery team. This is where plasma, the yellowish, liquid part of blood, is taken from people whoâve recovered from coronavirus and given to patients. The Recovery Trial is also looking at azithromycin, a commonly used antibiotic, and tocilizumab, an anti-inflammatory treatment. Monoclonal antibodies have been used clinically since the 1980s, and are used to treat many diseases including some forms of cancer. But because they are a relatively new technology, they can be expensive. The price for the Covid treatment has not yet been set. But Prof Landray says if it works, fair access to all patients, internationally, is an issue that needs to be considered. Some vaccines are entering the final phase of trials, but none are near being ready to roll out. And with Covid cases rising, people are still being hospitalised and some are dying. Apart from dexamethasone and another cheap steroid, hydrocortisone, there are no other clinically proven treatments for Covid-19, so finding new ways to help patients is vital. But even once we do have a vaccine, treatments will continue to play a role. Leah Lipsich, from Regeneron, said: âThere will be populations - the immunocompromised, the elderly - who may not mount a sufficient immune response to a vaccine and will require treatment. âAnd we feel very strongly that these highly potent neutralising antibodies really will help boost the immune response, and will always be needed even even when a vaccine is available.â Follow Rebecca on Twitter,external What is dexamethasone and how does it fight Covid-19?

Here are some of the key news stories so far today.  The news was brought to you by Ashitha Nagesh, Emma Harrison, Victoria Bisset and Victoria Lindrea. It was edited by Mal Siret and Owen Amos. About 3,000 undertakers in South Africa have gone on strike over pay and working conditions. As part of the strike they're refusing to collect bodies from people's homes and hospitals, and are also not holding burials. Their union wants the government to set up a coronavirus relief fund for the industry. Undertakers have struggled with the increasing cost of burials during the pandemic, because of the need for personal protective equipment (PPE), sanitiser and other extra protective items. But officials say they're worried the strike will cause a significant risk to public health. Macy's department store is making its famous Thanksgiving Day Parade a television-only special presentation, with no in-person spectators, the company said in a joint statement with the City of New York. Instead of going around the traditional 2.5-mile route, this year the parade will be staged solely around the Herald Square area of Midtown Manhattan. The first parade was staged in 1924, and has been a major fixture on the US festive calendar ever since. In recent years, more than 3.5m people have lined the streets each year to watch the parade in person. Faced with a surging coronavirus outbreak and poor working conditions, medical staff from across Morocco have been staging protests over the past few weeks. The country reported a record 2,430 cases last Friday, and has seen more than 1,000 new cases every day since July. Meanwhile, medical unions say some intensive care units are overrun and other wards are full. Morocco's Health Ministry has tried to raise capacity by setting up field hospitals - tents with beds and oxygen - but some medics say the main problem is staff shortages, particularly in rural areas. Anas Qarim, a nurse working at a Covid-19 hospital in Meknes, told Reuters news agency that they had just three nurses and two doctors to treat 120 patients. ""Imagine wearing full protective gear in the summer heat working continuously for hours,"" he said. There could be a second national lockdown in Wales if people fail ""to reconsider the choices we're making"", the health minister has warned. Vaughan Gething warned the pattern of increasing cases was ""similar to the situation we faced in early February"" - and that national lockdown remained an option. The number of new coronavirus cases in Wales increased by 183 on Monday - the largest rise in daily cases since 19 May, bringing the total number of confirmed cases in the country to 19,573. It comes as the government in Wales introduces mandatory face masks in all indoor public spaces and restricts more than six people from an extended household from meeting inside. ""If there isn't a change in behaviour, we could well be not just seven weeks away from a national lockdown, it could potentially be much quicker,"" Mr Gething said. Sameer HashmiMiddle East Business Correspondent, BBC News Volunteers for the phase three trial have come from countries including Egypt The United Arab Emirates government has approved
the use of a Covid-19 vaccine for frontline healthcare workers following
successful clinical trials. The countryâs health minister said the vaccine could be utilised in ""cases of emergency"" involving the
country's healthcare staff. He said the decision came after the phase three trial showed no adverse effects and that the vaccine was able to create antibodies. He added that 31,000 volunteers, representing 125 nationalities, had participated in the clinical trials. China-based Sinopharm CNG has developed
the vaccine and has been conducting the phase three clinical trial along with the
Abu Dhabi government and UAE-based artificial intelligence firm, G42
Healthcare. A secondary school in the UK has been closed and an entire year group asked to self-isolate, due to one confirmed case of coronavirus. In aletter to parents,external, Stantonbury International School, in Milton Keynes, said all of Year Eight had been ""in close contact"" with the person. It said those pupils and ""a number of teachers"" would have to self-isolate for 14 days. The state-funded academy has about 1,600 pupils; all pupils, except Year Eight, were expected to return by Wednesday. Head teacher Alison Ramsay thanked parents for their ""understanding at this difficult time"".  As we told you earlier, there were a further 2,621 confirmed cases of coronavirus in the UK today - after three consecutive days with more than 3,000 positive tests. It means the seven-day average for daily infections now stands at 3,004. The marked rise in infections over the past week is in keeping with many other countries in Europe, notably Spain and France. Nine more deaths - within 28 days of a positive test - were reported by the UK government on Monday. Deaths remain low - compared to figures at the height of the lockdown in April and May - despite the current spike in infections. On average, there were 12 deaths a day over the past seven days. Six the Musical will be at the Lyric theatre in London from 14 November Everybody's Talking About Jamie and Six will become the first musicals back in London's West End in mid-November, eight months after the curtain came down. They will hit the stage three weeks after a string of non-musical shows reopen London's theatre district. The Play That Goes Wrong, Agatha Christie's The Mousetrap and Adam Kay's This Is Going To Hurt will all admit socially distant audiences in October. Venue bosses said ""robust risk mitigation"" would be in place including reduced capacities, contactless tickets, temperature tests and deep cleans, as well as hand sanitation, face coverings and track and trace.

But where else have cases been surging? Which countries are experiencing a second wave? And what about the US, which remains the country with both the highest number of cases and deaths? In the US, overall, the daily number of new cases is continuing to fall: Some European countries are experiencing second surges of cases of the virus, after getting their outbreaks under control over the summer: A number of countries outside Europe have experienced second surges, too. In Israel, the government is imposing a second national lockdown from Friday in an attempt to control the outbreak: And in some countries, cases have been rising steadily for months: Kat Kingsley said she would be wary of giving her details out again A woman said she was sent ""creepy"" messages by a city bus tour worker who got her details from her test-and-trace form. Kat Kingsley, 25, from Hayle in Cornwall, went on the Original Tour bus in Windsor on Thursday. On Sunday she received two messages from a member of staff at the company saying he wanted to see her. Original Tour said it had launched an investigation as it ""takes the matter extremely seriously"". Read more here Officials in Marseille say the city is facing a spike in coronavirus cases, and that hospitals are close to running out of space to treat people with the virus. All but four of Marseille's intensive care beds are in use, they say, and plans have been made to reallocate resources from other areas to deal with the increase in patients. The authorities have also imposed a number of new restrictions - including making it mandatory to wear masks outdoors in the worst-hit areas, and banning groups of more than 10 from meeting in beaches and parks. Cases have been surging across France. This weekend, the country reporteda single-day increase of more than 10,000 new coronavirus cases. Labour has accused the government of trying to ""exempt the bloodsport passions of their big donors"" from new coronavirus restrictions, after it emerged thatso-called 'rule of six' limitswould not apply to hunting. Government guidelines exempt activities shooting and paintball, as part of a wider exemption for sport that can be done with more than five others. Other activities which are excluded from the ""rule of six"" regulations include team sports such as football, hockey and netball. But shadow environment secretary Luke Pollard said: ""Across the country, people are struggling to get Covid-19 tests anywhere near their homes. ""But the Conservatives are distracted with trying to exempt the bloodsport passions of their big donors from coronavirus regulations. ""It shows where this Government's priorities really lie."" As we reported earlier, the World Health Organization (WHO) has said there has been a record single-day rise in the number of new coronavirus cases. According to the WHO, 307,930 new cases were reported over the past 24 hours. The biggest increases were in India, the US and Brazil. We've put together this chart showing where in the world cases are surging - and falling. Fewer than half of all coronavirus fines handed out in England and Wales since the end of March have been paid so far. Of the 19,171 fines handed out by police for breaching coronavirus restrictions, just 8,930 were paid. Figures published in the letter to the Justice Committee revealed 8,954 fixed penalty notices - 8,325 in England and 629 in Wales - have not been paid within the 28-day payment period, meaning prosecution may follow. Another 1,287 unpaid fines are still pending. Police were given powers to fine people for breaching coronavirus restrictions from 27 March, following the lockdown on 23 March. There have been 2,621 new cases of coronavirus recorded across the UK. It marks a fall of more than 600 cases on Sunday's figures, when 3,330 positive cases were recorded. However weekend figures are often lower, due to delays in reporting. A further nine deaths have been recorded since 09:00 on Sunday, bringing the total reported death toll across the UK to 41,628. A death is anyone who dies within 28 days of testing positive for Covid-19. This video can not be played How not to wear a face mask Does it matter if you wear your face mask wrong? Well, yes. Wearing a face mask or covering incorrectly can make it easier for coronavirus to spread. From today it is compulsory to wear face coverings in shops and indoor places in Wales for everyone aged 11 and over. Face coverings must also be worn in shops, supermarkets and shopping centres in England, Scotland and Northern Ireland. Read

About 3,000 undertakers in South Africa have gone on strike over pay and working conditions. As part of the strike they're refusing to collect bodies from people's homes and hospitals, and are also not holding burials. Their union wants the government to set up a coronavirus relief fund for the industry. Undertakers have struggled with the increasing cost of burials during the pandemic, because of the need for personal protective equipment (PPE), sanitiser and other extra protective items. But officials say they're worried the strike will cause a significant risk to public health. Macy's department store is making its famous Thanksgiving Day Parade a television-only special presentation, with no in-person spectators, the company said in a joint statement with the City of New York. Instead of going around the traditional 2.5-mile route, this year the parade will be staged solely around the Herald Square area of Midtown Manhattan. The first parade was staged in 1924, and has been a major fixture on the US festive calendar ever since. In recent years, more than 3.5m people have lined the streets each year to watch the parade in person. Faced with a surging coronavirus outbreak and poor working conditions, medical staff from across Morocco have been staging protests over the past few weeks. The country reported a record 2,430 cases last Friday, and has seen more than 1,000 new cases every day since July. Meanwhile, medical unions say some intensive care units are overrun and other wards are full. Morocco's Health Ministry has tried to raise capacity by setting up field hospitals - tents with beds and oxygen - but some medics say the main problem is staff shortages, particularly in rural areas. Anas Qarim, a nurse working at a Covid-19 hospital in Meknes, told Reuters news agency that they had just three nurses and two doctors to treat 120 patients. ""Imagine wearing full protective gear in the summer heat working continuously for hours,"" he said. There could be a second national lockdown in Wales if people fail ""to reconsider the choices we're making"", the health minister has warned. Vaughan Gething warned the pattern of increasing cases was ""similar to the situation we faced in early February"" - and that national lockdown remained an option. The number of new coronavirus cases in Wales increased by 183 on Monday - the largest rise in daily cases since 19 May, bringing the total number of confirmed cases in the country to 19,573. It comes as the government in Wales introduces mandatory face masks in all indoor public spaces and restricts more than six people from an extended household from meeting inside. ""If there isn't a change in behaviour, we could well be not just seven weeks away from a national lockdown, it could potentially be much quicker,"" Mr Gething said. Sameer HashmiMiddle East Business Correspondent, BBC News Volunteers for the phase three trial have come from countries including Egypt The United Arab Emirates government has approved
the use of a Covid-19 vaccine for frontline healthcare workers following
successful clinical trials. The countryâs health minister said the vaccine could be utilised in ""cases of emergency"" involving the
country's healthcare staff. He said the decision came after the phase three trial showed no adverse effects and that the vaccine was able to create antibodies. He added that 31,000 volunteers, representing 125 nationalities, had participated in the clinical trials. China-based Sinopharm CNG has developed
the vaccine and has been conducting the phase three clinical trial along with the

In aletter to parents,external, Stantonbury International School, in Milton Keynes, said all of Year Eight had been ""in close contact"" with the person. It said those pupils and ""a number of teachers"" would have to self-isolate for 14 days. The state-funded academy has about 1,600 pupils; all pupils, except Year Eight, were expected to return by Wednesday. Head teacher Alison Ramsay thanked parents for their ""understanding at this difficult time"".  As we told you earlier, there were a further 2,621 confirmed cases of coronavirus in the UK today - after three consecutive days with more than 3,000 positive tests. It means the seven-day average for daily infections now stands at 3,004. The marked rise in infections over the past week is in keeping with many other countries in Europe, notably Spain and France. Nine more deaths - within 28 days of a positive test - were reported by the UK government on Monday. Deaths remain low - compared to figures at the height of the lockdown in April and May - despite the current spike in infections. On average, there were 12 deaths a day over the past seven days.

But where else have cases been surging? Which countries are experiencing a second wave? And what about the US, which remains the country with both the highest number of cases and deaths? In the US, overall, the daily number of new cases is continuing to fall: Some European countries are experiencing second surges of cases of the virus, after getting their outbreaks under control over the summer: A number of countries outside Europe have experienced second surges, too. In Israel, the government is imposing a second national lockdown from Friday in an attempt to control the outbreak: And in some countries, cases have been rising steadily for months: Kat Kingsley said she would be wary of giving her details out again A woman said she was sent ""creepy"" messages by a city bus tour worker who got her details from her test-and-trace form. Kat Kingsley, 25, from Hayle in Cornwall, went on the Original Tour bus in Windsor on Thursday. On Sunday she received two messages from a member of staff at the company saying he wanted to see her. Original Tour said it had launched an investigation as it ""takes the matter extremely seriously"". Read more here Officials in Marseille say the city is facing a spike in coronavirus cases, and that hospitals are close to running out of space to treat people with the virus. All but four of Marseille's intensive care beds are in use, they say, and plans have been made to reallocate resources from other areas to deal with the increase in patients. The authorities have also imposed a number of new restrictions - including making it mandatory to wear masks outdoors in the worst-hit areas, and banning groups of more than 10 from meeting in beaches and parks. Cases have been surging across France. This weekend, the country reporteda single-day increase of more than 10,000 new coronavirus cases. Labour has accused the government of trying to ""exempt the bloodsport passions of their big donors"" from new coronavirus restrictions, after it emerged thatso-called 'rule of six' limitswould not apply to hunting. Government guidelines exempt activities shooting and paintball, as part of a wider exemption for sport that can be done with more than five others. Other activities which are excluded from the ""rule of six"" regulations include team sports such as football, hockey and netball. But shadow environment secretary Luke Pollard said: ""Across the country, people are struggling to get Covid-19 tests anywhere near their homes. ""But the Conservatives are distracted with trying to exempt the bloodsport passions of their big donors from coronavirus regulations. ""It shows where this Government's priorities really lie."" As we reported earlier, the World Health Organization (WHO) has said there has been a record single-day rise in the number of new coronavirus cases. According to the WHO, 307,930 new cases were reported over the past 24 hours. The biggest increases were in India, the US and Brazil. We've put together this chart showing where in the world cases are surging - and falling. Fewer than half of all coronavirus fines handed out in England and Wales since the end of March have been paid so far. Of the 19,171 fines handed out by police for breaching coronavirus restrictions, just 8,930 were paid. Figures published in the letter to the Justice Committee revealed 8,954 fixed penalty notices - 8,325 in England and 629 in Wales - have not been paid within the 28-day payment period, meaning prosecution may follow. Another 1,287 unpaid fines are still pending. Police were given powers to fine people for breaching coronavirus restrictions from 27 March, following the lockdown on 23 March. There have been 2,621 new cases of coronavirus recorded across the UK. It marks a fall of more than 600 cases on Sunday's figures, when 3,330 positive cases were recorded. However weekend figures are often lower, due to delays in reporting. A further nine deaths have been recorded since 09:00 on Sunday, bringing the total reported death toll across the UK to 41,628. A death is anyone who dies within 28 days of testing positive for Covid-19. This video can not be played How not to wear a face mask Does it matter if you wear your face mask wrong? Well, yes. Wearing a face mask or covering incorrectly can make it easier for coronavirus to spread.

"This video can not be played Boris Johnson: ""I have absolutely no desire to use these measures"" Boris Johnson has said the UK must reserve the right to override the Brexit deal to protect the country's ""economic and political integrity"". The PM said legislation was needed to resolve ""tensions"" in the EU-UK deal. He said it would ensure the UK could not be ""broken up"" by a foreign power and the EU was acting in an ""extreme way"", by threatening food exports. Labour said the PM had caused the ""mess"" by reneging on a deal he had previously called a ""triumph"". The Internal Market Bill is expected to pass its first parliamentary test shortly, when MPs vote on it at about 22.00 BST, despite the reservations of many MPs that it gives the UK the power to break international law. A number of Conservative MPs have said they will not support the bill as it stands and some could register their concerns by abstaining. How could the Northern Ireland Brexit deal change? Brexit bill powers 'insurance policy' for UK Blair and Major urge MPs to reject Brexit bill The UK left the EU on 31 January, having negotiated and signed the withdrawal agreement with the bloc. A key part of the agreement - which is now an international treaty - was the Northern Ireland Protocol, designed to prevent a hard border returning to the island of Ireland. The Internal Market Bill proposed by the government would override that part of that agreement when it comes to movement of goods between Northern Ireland and Britain and would allow the UK to re-interpret ""state aid"" rules on subsidies for firms in Northern Ireland, in the event of the two sides not agreeing a future trade deal. Speaking at the start of the five-hour debate, the PM said the bill should be ""welcomed by everyone"" who cares about the ""sovereignty and integrity of the UK"". He said the UK had signed up to the ""finely balanced"" withdrawal agreement, including the Northern Ireland Protocol, in ""good faith"" and was committed to honouring its obligations, including the introduction of ""light touch"" checks on trade between Britain and Northern Ireland. But he said additional ""protective powers"" were now necessary to guard against the EU's ""proven willingness"" to interpret aspects of the agreement in ""absurd"" ways, ""simply to exert leverage"" in the trade talks. This video can not be played Ed Miliband says it is not an argument of Leave versus Remain, but âan argument about right versus wrongâ. ""What we cannot tolerate now is a situation where our EU counterparts seriously believe they have the power to break up our country,"" he told MPs. ""We cannot have a situation where the very boundaries of our country can be dictated to by a foreign power or international organisation."" He also suggested the EU was threatening not to allow British firms to export products of animal origin to either the continent or Northern Ireland. ""Absurd and self-defeating as that action would be...the EU still have not taken this revolver off the table,"" he told MPs. However, he sought to reassure MPs that the powers were an ""insurance policy"" and Parliament would be given a vote before they were ever invoked, insisting ""I have absolutely no desire to use these measures"". But former Labour leader Ed Miliband, standing in for Sir Keir Starmer afterthe Labour leader was forced to self-isolate at home, said the ""very act of passing the law"" would constitute a breach of international law. He told MPs the PM ""could not blame anyone else"", having drawn up and signed the Brexit deal himself. ""It is his deal, it is his mess, it is his failure,"" he said. ""For the first time in his life, it is time to take responsibility and to fess up,"" he said. ""Either he was not straight with the country in the first place or he did not understand it."" He added: ""This is not just legislative hooliganism on any issue, it is on the most sensitive issue of all."" Among Tory MPs to speak out were ex-ministers Andrew Mitchell, Sir Bob Neill and Stephen Hammond, all of whom urged the government to settle differences with the EU through the arbitration process in the Agreement. Conservative MP Charles Walker said the EU was a ""pain in the neck"" but urged the government not to ""press the nuclear button"" before all other options had been exhausted. ""I am not going to be voting for this bill at second reading because if you keep whacking a dog, don't be surprised when it bites you back,"" he said. And Former Chancellor Sajid Javid has joined the ranks of potential rebels, saying he could not see why it was necessary to ""pre-emptively renege"" on the withdrawal agreement.

A senior government source told the BBC ""all options are on the table"" in terms of possible action against Tory MPs who do not support the bill. The bill, which sets out how trade between different nations of the UK will operate after the UK leaves the EU single market on 31 December, is likely to face more difficulties in its later stages, especially in the House of Lords. The DUP's Sammy Wilson welcomed the bill, but said his party still had concerns and would be tabling amendments to ""ensure Northern Ireland is not left in a state aid straight jacket and our businesses are not weighed down by unnecessary paperwork when trading within the United Kingdom"". The SNP's Ian Blackford said the bill was the ""greatest threat"" to devolved government in Scotland since the establishment of the Scottish Parliament 20 years ago. This video can not be played David Cameron said he has âmisgivings about what is being proposedâ ""We are discussing the details of a bill which this government casually and brazenly admits breaks international and domestic law, he said. Five former prime ministers have raised concerns about the bill, including Boris Johnson's predecessor Theresa May - who is absent from Monday's debate as she is on a visit to South Korea. Speaking earlier on Monday, David Cameron said ""passing an act of Parliament and then going on to break an international treaty obligation...should be the absolute final resort"".

However weekend figures are often lower, due to delays in reporting. A further nine deaths have been recorded since 09:00 on Sunday, bringing the total reported death toll across the UK to 41,628. A death is anyone who dies within 28 days of testing positive for Covid-19. This video can not be played How not to wear a face mask Does it matter if you wear your face mask wrong? Well, yes. Wearing a face mask or covering incorrectly can make it easier for coronavirus to spread. From today it is compulsory to wear face coverings in shops and indoor places in Wales for everyone aged 11 and over. Face coverings must also be worn in shops, supermarkets and shopping centres in England, Scotland and Northern Ireland. Read

The health body said the data of 18,105 Welsh residents was online for 20 hours on 30 August and it was viewed 56 times before it was removed. Most cases gave initials, date of birth, geographical area and sex, meaning the risk of identification was low, Public Health Wales said. However 1,928 people in living in communal settings were more at risk as nursing home residents or those living in supported housing also had the name of their place of residence published. The incident was the result of ""individual human error"" when the information was uploaded to a public server searchable by anyone using the site. Read

school for millions of Italian children today. I grew up learning the three Rs, but today Italian children have to know the three Ms: Mascherina, Mani, Metro (mask,
hands, metre). There was the usual mix of first-day excitement and nerves. Ten-year-old
Gabriele posed joyfully for a photo with his classmates in masks. His mother,
an A&E doctor, was impressed to see them greeting each other with elbow
bumps â not the usual bear hugs. ""The parents were far less disciplined,"" she
remarked. My seven-year-old is relieved to return to proper lessons
with teachers, instead of ""full-time homework"". But she is sad that coronavirus
means ""it's never going to be the same"". She's worried about playtime - ""what
happens when it rains?"" - and nervous about all the new rules. So are the
parents. Which entrance will they use? What if you have two kids at
the school? Borrowing in class is banned and everything has to be name-labelled.
Each individual pencil?! Masks can only be removed once children are seated at their
desks. At our school, washable masks aren't allowed: they must be surgical,
changed daily, and for now provided by the parents. Disappointingly, our class sizes haven't been reduced or
classrooms extended. Pigeon holes have simply been removed to make room to
space out the desks. Despite our worries, my daughter is looking on the bright side: ""At least nobody can nick my pencil sharpener."" Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking.",Negative,6.5455174e-15
"People should report their neighbours for any suspected breaches of new ""rule of six"" limits on social gatherings, the crime minister has said. Kit Malthouse urged residents to pass on details of suspected law-breaking through non-emergency numbers. From today, new rules restrict indoor and outdoor gatherings in England and Scotland, and indoor groups in Wales. They come after the UK'sreproduction, or R, number escalatedto between one and 1.2 for the first time since March. There were a further 2,621 confirmed cases of coronavirus in the UK on Monday, a fall after three consecutive days with more than 3,000 positive tests. But there have been widespread concerns about the availability of testing. Nine more deaths were reported within 28 days of a positive test. What are the new rules? Why is the R number so important? 'We've got four kids so can't see anyone else' Asked on BBC Radio 4's Today programme whether a person should report a gathering of seven or more in a neighbour's garden, Mr Malthouse said: ""It is open to neighbours to do exactly that through the non-emergency number. ""And if they are concerned and they do see that kind of thing, then absolutely they should think about it."" The crime and policing minister added there were ""discussions about what reporting mechanisms there might be, but there is obviously the non-emergency number (101) that people can ring and report issues they wish to"". National Police Chiefs' Council (NPCC) chairman Martin Hewitt denied that enforcement of the rule of six relied on people ""grassing up"" their neighbours. ""It relies on all of us being responsible,"" he told BBC Breakfast. BBC home affairs correspondent Daniel Sandford said guidance to police forces in England on how to enforce the new rule was not yet ready, so people were unlikely to be fined for a few days. Meanwhile, Prof Bobby Duffy, director of King's College London's policy institute, told the BBC that one in 20 people said in a survey of attitudes during the pandemic that they had reported others for rule breaches. Social gatheringsof more than six peoplein England, Scotland and Wales will not be allowed in lawfrom Monday 14 Septemberwith some exceptions The new ruleapplies to people in private homes, indoors and outdoors, and places such as pubs, restaurants, cafes and public outdoor spaces In Scotland, the rule appliesto a maximum of two householdsand in Wales it applies tothe same extended household Itapplies to all agesin England, but not to those aged12 and under in Scotland, and thoseunder 11 in Walesin those households The ruledoes not apply to schools, universities and workplaces, or weddings, funerals and organised team sports A full list of exemptionshas beenpublished in England,external Peoplewho ignore policecould be fined Â£100 - doubling with each offence to a maximum of Â£3,200 Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer told LBC he backed the rules, adding: ""You can make the argument of why not five or why not six or seven - you have to go with a number backed by the science and they say six, and I think we should abide by that rule."" Later, it was announced Sir Keir would self-isolate, after a family membershowed possible coronavirus symptoms. The new rules come into force amid reports that the UK's testing systems are overwhelmed, withScotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon expressing ""serious concern""over what she described as a backlog of results in the lab network. Alice Wiseman, Gateshead's director of public heath, told the BBC local authorities had requested a mobile testing unit on Saturday, only to see it arrive a day late with dozens of people directed elsewhere for tests. ""We're not able to do contact tracing unless we have a positive result,"" she said. ""In theory, there are potentially people walking around with Covid who just don't know."" Doris-Ann Williams, chief executive of laboratory testing industry body the British In Vitro Diagnostic Association, said delays to testing were being caused by a lack of staff and they were ""trying to desperately recruit more"" to increase capacity for the winter. Police in Bristol spoke to one mum at a toddler's picnic with seven people As the new law on gatherings came into force, police in Bristol were soon explaining the changes to confused members of the public. One mum was told her toddler's picnic - a group of seven - was now illegal. ""It's very difficult to understand though, if I'm allowed to be in a pub with a group of people a metre apart but I can't be with my kids' friends,"" she replied to the officer. Another woman, Nicky, said she thought her gathering of more than six was allowed because the children all attended school together. Groups like this would be allowed in nearby Wales and in Scotland, where children do not count towards the total. ""We could just go over the bridge and be with a much larger group of people,"" Nicky said. ""It does feel a bit unfair."" Most people were aware of the changes and kept to groups of six or fewer Elsewhere, the new rule brought hobbies and clubs to a halt. Jacky Wadsworth, secretary of Rockingham Brass Band in South Yorkshire, said their 28-person band was like a ""second family"" but now members would not be able to meet at the same time. They had hired a larger hall to allow for social distancing, but the new rules meant ""we are back to square one"". The ""rule of six"" in England - hailed as ""super simple"" by Health Secretary Matt Hancock - replaces guidance on allowing two households to meet indoors and a previous ban on gatherings which exceeded 30 people. Under the changes, larger gatherings are still allowed at gyms, schools, places of worship, weddings and funerals. Education and work settings are not affected. And new details of exemptions,externalpublished on Monday revealed that shooting, yachting and ultimate frisbee were among the sports that could continue in groups of more than six. Some Tory MPshave also urged No 10to exempt young children in England and called for a debate over the rules. TESTING:What tests are available? SYMPTOMS:What are they and how to guard against them? LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? TEST AND TRACE:How does it work? Groups larger than six can be broken up by police, with members of the group facing fines of Â£100 for a first offence, doubling on each further offence up to Â£3,200. But it emerged that fewer than half of people fined under existing coronavirus regulations in England and Wales had paid their penalties. A letter from the Attorney General,external, written on 25 August and published last week, said 46% of more than 19,000 fines issued were past the deadline for payment and could be considered for prosecution. In other developments: the government's chief scientific adviser sayshe was rebuked by other senior officials for arguing strongly in favour of a lockdownbefore it was imposed in March Downing Street said that about 99% of schools expected to reopen had done so, with only a ""very small number"" asking some pupils to stay at home due to outbreaks a new antibody treatment is to be trialledon Covid-19 patients in UK hospitals a ban on household visits affecting 1.75m people in Glasgow and the west of Scotland is to beextended for another week a British Medical Association survey of 8,000 doctors and medical students suggested a second peak of Covid-19 was their number one concern pub chain JD Wetherspoon insisted its venues were safe after it confirmed 66 of its workershad tested positive for coronavirus THE RULE OF SIX:What's in the small print?

"Alison Keen and her husband have four children so are already a group of six Indoor and outdoor social gatherings of more than six people will be banned in England from Monday as coronavirus restrictions are tightened. Although larger households are able to gather within their bubbles, some can no longer meet up with friends and family. Before the pandemic hit, Alison Keen had planned a big party for her 40th birthday on 21 September. When lockdown happened, she postponed it until 2021 and instead had hoped for a family gathering. But now that too cannot go ahead. She and her husband have four children, meaning the new""rule of six""applies solely to their family. ""I can't meet up with anyone just because I've got kids,"" said Mrs Keen, from Newcastle-under-Lyme, Staffordshire. ""Mum's upset that she can't see me on my birthday and really annoyed that she could have come to see the kids last week, but not next week."" Mrs Keen said allowing her children, between six and 11, to go back to school but not have family gatherings ""seems daft"". The family had thought her parents, who live in Birmingham, would be able to see Mrs Keen's two sisters, who both have fewer children. But from Tuesdayadditional restrictions in Birmingham will prevent this. Mrs Keen's four children have all recently returned to school Prime MinisterBoris Johnson announced the new rules""to avoid a second national lockdown"" as the rate of infection climbs across the country. It applies both indoors and outdoors and to all ages - although there are some exemptions, such as gatherings for work or school. The new rules will be enforced by police who will have powers to issue fines and make arrests. ""I get they're trying to simplify the rules, but that's not how viruses work,"" said Mrs Keen. ""At the end of the day it's a new virus and as you learn, policies have to evolve. But it feels awful."" This video can not be played The prime minister said the new measures were ""not another national lockdown"" Dee Jones, a mum of six from Telford, in Shropshire, said the new restrictions means she won't be able to see all of her children, five of whom have moved out and married. She works two jobs and so only has one weekend off each month - the family would normally use that weekend to get together for a big meal. ""We can't do that now, unless my son-in-law sits out in the garden and eats his dinner there."" The ""rule of six"" will make it almost impossible to arrange seeing her family and already they are having to do so ""almost on a rota"". She said a turkey, bought for the family's Easter meal, had been ""stuck in the freezer all throughout lockdown - if I didn't laugh about it I would have cried"", adding she was finding the restrictions ""quite depressing"". ""Honestly, it's ridiculous. I'm frustrated. We've done what we've been advised and there are clearly people out there who haven't."" Stephanie Raheel, from Yardley in Birmingham, has three children, Alina, Amaya and Arissa. Her husband's parents are at the heart of their family and they would usually meet them regularly with extended family members. To go back to stricter measures will be hard, she said, ""especially for the children - it's hard for them to understand"". Latest news and updates from the West Midlands So how many friends can I meet - and where? What can police do if I break the new rules? Mrs Raheel's children, aged between three and six, have returned to school and nursery but she worries the restrictions will mean the older people in her family will miss out on special moments with her young daughters. ""Within our family we've had two babies born in lockdown,"" she said. ""The key moments, you want to celebrate with your loved ones. ""The grandparents too, they love to see the little ones."" Birmingham has the second highest rate of infections in England - 85.4 per 100,000 people Mrs Raheel said her mother-in-law is due to have an eye operation next week, something her husband and his six brothers are keen to support her with. ""We'll all just want to go and see her and check she's OK - when people are in need, it's difficult."" She is not sure how the family will be able to keep checking in on loved ones without breaking the new restrictions, but thinks they will just have to take it in turns to visit. ""Everyone is just a little bit puzzled about why it is six people, and they're not shutting restaurants and pubs - it just doesn't make any sense. ""There are so many different things you're allowed to do and not allowed to do, we just have to accept that's the way it is.""

"The bomb was detonated at the end of an Ariana Grande concert, killing 22 people Bereaved families whose loved ones were killed in the Manchester Arena attack have shared their heartache as the inquiry heads into its second week. The father of Martyn Hett was the first to present a ""pen portrait"" of his son, whose ""memory will shine brightly"". The portraits will give each family the chance to present a personal insight into the lives of those who died. Twenty-two people were killed when Salman Abedi detonated a bomb as 14,000 fans left the arena in May 2017. The inquiry comes more than three years after the bombing at the end of an Ariana Grande concert, which left hundreds more injured. What is the Manchester Arena inquiry? It was due to start in June, but was delayed by the trial of Abedi's brother Hashem,who was jailed for at least 55 years for 22 murders on 20 August. The inquiry is being held at Manchester Magistrates' Court, less than a mile away from where the bombing happened. The ""pen portraits"" will be provided by family members, or others on their behalf, reading out witness statements and playing music and videos to remember those who died. Tributes were left in in St Ann's Square in Manchester city centre in the wake of the bombing Paul Greaney QC, counsel to the inquiry, said they would ""ensure the deceased and their families are at the centre of this process"". ""Each 'pen portrait' is deeply affecting. The experience will be moving and distressing... and exceptionally difficult for the families,"" he added. During the first ""pen portrait"", the inquiry hearda moving testimony from Mr Hett's father Paul. ""How would I describe Martyn's personality in one simple word? Fun. He had the most wicked sense of humour,"" Mr Hett said. The 29-year-old, from Stockport, Greater Manchester, ""lit up everyone around him"", his father added. Martyn Hett, pictured centre, was ""so vibrant, so full of energy"" The family of John Atkinson, 28, from Radcliffe in Bury, told the public inquiry he had a ""massively addictive personality"" andhis ""smile would light the room up"". ""He loved everyone and everyone loved him,"" his parents Kevan and Daryl said. ""He was the centre of our world."" ""He was the centre of our world,"" said John Atkinson's parents Eilidh MacLeod, 14, from the Isle of Barra, was described as a ""bundle of fun"" with""perfect quips, one-liners and an infectious laugh"". The teenager, who loved playing the bagpipes, was ""growing into a lovely young woman with this fantastic gift she was able to express herself with"", her father Roderick said. Her former primary school teacher Michelle McLean said: ""The whole island community misses her - as her teacher she taught me to be a better person."" Eilidh MacLeod was described as a ""bundle of fun"" Sorrell Leczkowski was ""hungry for knowledge"" anddreamed of studying in New York to fulfil her ambition to become an architect, her mother told the inquiry. The 14-year-old had gone to the Manchester Arena with her family to collect her sister who was at the concert. Her mother Samantha and grandmother Pauline were both seriously injured. Sorrell Leczkowski dreamed of studying in New York The commemorative hearings are expected to conclude on 23 September. The inquiry was set up to examine the background to the attack and the response of the emergency services. Its chairman, Sir John Saunders, will make a report and recommendations once all the evidence has been heard, which is expected to take up to six months.

"This video can not be played David Cameron said he has âmisgivings about what is being proposedâ David Cameron has become the fifth former prime minister to criticise a new bill attempting to override the Brexit withdrawal agreement. No 10 says the Internal Market Bill was a ""critical piece of legislation for the UK"". But Mr Cameron said he had ""misgivings"" over it and breaking an international treaty should be the ""final resort"". Former Tory PMs Theresa May and Sir John Major, and Labour's Tony Blair and Gordon Brown have condemned the plan. However, Boris Johnson's official spokesman said the bill delivered a ""vital legal safety net"" so the government can ""take the necessary steps to ensure the integrity of UK's internal market"" - steps it hoped never to have to use. Brexit bill powers 'insurance policy' for UK Blair and Major urge MPs to reject Brexit bill 'Firm and strong' EU response expected - Irish PM MPs have begun debating the bill at its second reading, with the PM making the opening remarks, and it is expected to pass this early stage after a vote at around 22:00. But the legislation is likely to face more difficulties in its later stages, especially when the bill heads for debate in the Lords. Former Attorney General Geoffrey Cox accused Mr Johnson of doing""unconscionable"" damage to Britain's international reputationand said he would ""withhold"" his support for the bill in its current form. The PM's special envoy for Freedom of Religion or Belief, Tory MP Rehman Chishti,has resigned over the proposed law,external, saying: ""I have always acted in a manner which respects the rule of law... [and] voting for this bill as it currently stands would be contrary to the values I hold dearest."" A senior government source told the BBC ""all options are on the table"" in terms of possible action against Tory MPs who do not support the bill. Labour's shadow business secretary, Ed Miliband, also called the proposed law ""legislative hooliganism"". Mr Miliband will stand in for Sir Keir Starmer at the opposition dispatch box afterthe Labour leader was forced to self-isolate at homewhen a member of his household developed possible coronavirus symptoms. The UK left the EU on 31 January, having negotiated and signed the withdrawal agreement with the bloc. The two sides are now in the closing weeks of negotiations for a post-Brexit trade deal beforethe transition periodends on 31 December - with informal talks taking place in Brussels this week. A key part of the withdrawal agreement - which is now an international treaty - was the Northern Ireland Protocol, designed to prevent a hard border returning to the island of Ireland. The Internal Market Bill proposed by the government would override that part of that agreement when it came to goods and would allow the UK to modify or re-interpret ""state aid"" rules on subsidies for firms in Northern Ireland, in the event of the two sides not agreeing a future trade deal. Last week,Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis said the bill would ""break international law"" in a ""specific and limited way"", leading to swathes of criticism from all sides of the political spectrum. Here we go again... a Brexit deadline looms, there's a whole lot of noise about it in Westminster, and the UK and the EU can't agree. And yes, yet again, there is a swirling soup of jargon every other sentence. Take a few steps back though, and here is what this all amounts to - how the UK will trade with its nearest neighbours from January next year onwards and how the different parts of the UK will trade with each other. This matters economically - and matters politically too. The Brexit process has long exposed the tensions between the UK and Brussels, but don't underestimate the tensions it places on the UK as well. Those in Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales who have long argued to be unshackled from London, as they see it, argue Brexit is the ultimate case study to illustrate their argument. And so the government at Westminster's delicate task is to extricate the UK from one union, the EU, while holding together another one, the UK. All of these rows have that central aim at their core. Mr Cameron - who called the EU referendum when he was PM - said he had ""misgivings about what is being proposed"". Speaking to reporters, he said: ""Passing an act of Parliament and then going on to break an international treaty obligation is the very, very last thing you should contemplate. It should be the absolute final resort."" Mr Cameron said the ""bigger picture"" was about trying to get a trade deal with the EU, urging the government to ""keep that context [and] that big prize in mind."" The comments follow stronger criticism by the four other surviving former prime ministers of the UK. Mrs May, who still sits as an MP in the Commons, said breaking international law would damage ""trust"" in the UK, while Mr Brown said it would be akin to ""self-harm"" for the country. Sir John and Mr Blair - who were both in office during key periods of the Northern Ireland peace process -wrote a joint article in the Sunday Times,externalaccusing Mr Johnson of ""embarrassing"" the UK and urging MPs to reject the ""shameful"" attempt to override parts of the withdrawal agreement. Earlier, Policing Minister Kit Malthouse called the bill a ""practical"" step, saying it ""solves the problem that we're faced with"" over the future of trade with the EU. He told BBC Breakfast: ""What we've done is to say transparently that this is a situation which we think may occur - certainly that's what's being intimated from the EU. It's a problem we have to solve so here's a bill that solves it. ""In the end those people that oppose this bill have to tell us what the resolution is."" On Sunday, Justice Secretary Robert Buckland told the BBC the bill was an ""insurance policy"" in case the UK and EU do not agree a post-Brexit trade deal. He said he hoped powers being sought by ministers would never be needed, and that he would resign if the UK ended up breaking international law ""in a way I find unacceptable"". But Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer accused government ministers of handing out ""misinformation"" over the weekend and ""spinning"" the reasons they were pursuing the new bill. He told LBC: ""[Mr Johnson] is making a mistake reneging on a treaty - that will have reputational damage for the UK. ""I would say to the prime minister, look go away, go back to the drawing board, drop these problems, don't act in this reckless and wrong way and we'll look again at the legislation."" This video can not be played Robert Buckland: ""If I see the rule of law being broken in a way that I find unacceptable then of course I will go"" The bill has split opinion on the Tory backbenches. MP Sir Desmond Swayne said he would be supporting the bill, praising the government for preparing in case no trade deal is agreed by the end of the year. He told BBC News: ""If the government didn't take precautions against that possibility, it would be utterly negligent. It is right it arm itself with the powers just in case."" But his colleague, and chair of the Justice Select Committee, Sir Bob Neill, said the government and its supporters needed to ""calm the language"". He said there was already a mechanism for addressing the government's concerns, but he was willing to ""meet them half-way"" with an amendment to the bill - only allowing the elements that would break international law to be used if Parliament signs it off.

Twenty-two people were killed when Salman Abedi detonated a bomb as 14,000 fans left the arena in May 2017. The inquiry comes more than three years after the bombing at the end of an Ariana Grande concert, which left hundreds more injured. What is the Manchester Arena inquiry? It was due to start in June, but was delayed by the trial of Abedi's brother Hashem,who was jailed for at least 55 years for 22 murders on 20 August. The inquiry is being held at Manchester Magistrates' Court, less than a mile away from where the bombing happened. The ""pen portraits"" will be provided by family members, or others on their behalf, reading out witness statements and playing music and videos to remember those who died. Tributes were left in in St Ann's Square in Manchester city centre in the wake of the bombing Paul Greaney QC, counsel to the inquiry, said they would ""ensure the deceased and their families are at the centre of this process"". ""Each 'pen portrait' is deeply affecting. The experience will be moving and distressing... and exceptionally difficult for the families,"" he added. During the first ""pen portrait"", the inquiry hearda moving testimony from Mr Hett's father Paul. ""How would I describe Martyn's personality in one simple word? Fun. He had the most wicked sense of humour,"" Mr Hett said. The 29-year-old, from Stockport, Greater Manchester, ""lit up everyone around him"", his father added. Martyn Hett, pictured centre, was ""so vibrant, so full of energy"" The family of John Atkinson, 28, from Radcliffe in Bury, told the public inquiry he had a ""massively addictive personality"" andhis ""smile would light the room up"". ""He loved everyone and everyone loved him,"" his parents Kevan and Daryl said. ""He was the centre of our world."" ""He was the centre of our world,"" said John Atkinson's parents Eilidh MacLeod, 14, from the Isle of Barra, was described as a ""bundle of fun"" with""perfect quips, one-liners and an infectious laugh"". The teenager, who loved playing the bagpipes, was ""growing into a lovely young woman with this fantastic gift she was able to express herself with"", her father Roderick said. Her former primary school teacher Michelle McLean said: ""The whole island community misses her - as her teacher she taught me to be a better person."" Eilidh MacLeod was described as a ""bundle of fun"" Sorrell Leczkowski was ""hungry for knowledge"" anddreamed of studying in New York to fulfil her ambition to become an architect, her mother told the inquiry. The 14-year-old had gone to the Manchester Arena with her family to collect her sister who was at the concert. Her mother Samantha and grandmother Pauline were both seriously injured. Sorrell Leczkowski dreamed of studying in New York The commemorative hearings are expected to conclude on 23 September. The inquiry was set up to examine the background to the attack and the response of the emergency services. Its chairman, Sir John Saunders, will make a report and recommendations once all the evidence has been heard, which is expected to take up to six months.

"This video can not be played Trump: ""It'll start getting cooler"" US President Donald Trump has dismissed concerns over climate change on a visit to fire-ravaged California, telling an official ""I don't think science knows"" about global warming. ""It'll start getting cooler, you just watch,"" Mr Trump said after he was urged not to ""ignore the science"". Blazes in several states have burned vast areas of land and killed at least 36 people since early August. Scientists say human activities have driven up global temperatures. But Mr Trump has blamed poor forest management for the fires that have burned almost 2 million hectares (5 million acres) of land in California, Oregon and Washington state. During his visit to the US West Coast, Mr Trump - who hasoften denied climate change- repeated his argument on forest management as he met Californian officials involved in the battle against the wildfires. A really simple guide to climate change Is Trump right about the cause of US wildfires? Climate change takes centre stage in presidential campaign Earlier on Monday, Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden called Mr Trump ""a climate arsonist"". In 2018,the president criticised California's forest management, pointing to Finland, where he said they raked and cleared the forests to prevent fires. When asked by a reporter whether climate change was a factor in the massive wildfires, Mr Trump responded: ""I think this is more of a management situation."" He also claimed that other countries had not dealt with the same level of forest fires, despite major conflagrations in Australia and the Amazon rainforest in recent years that experts attributed to the changing climate. This video can not be played Drone footage shows Oregon town covered in flame retardant ""They don't have problems like this,"" he said. ""They have very explosive trees, but they don't have problems like this."" He added: ""When you get into climate change, well is India going to change its ways? And is China going to change its ways? And Russia? Is Russia going to change its ways?"" Mr Trump has previously called climate change ""mythical"", ""non-existent"", or ""an expensive hoax""- but has also described it as a ""serious subject"". He pulled the US out of the Paris climate agreement, which committed the US and 187 other countries to keeping a global temperature rise this century well below 2C (3.6F) above pre-industrial levels. It's a path well worn by President Trump, especially in relation to climate change - other countries are taking advantage of the US and not doing their fair share. But the irony is that the absence of the US from the Paris agreement is making a changing of the ways much harder to achieve. In the Paris pact, China committed to peak its carbon emissions by 2030 at the latest - and is on course to do that. India agreed to reduce the intensity of its emissions by 2030, and significantly increase renewables as part of the energy mix. Last year, India's spending on solar energy eclipsed coal fired power for the first time. Russia has pledged to cut carbon by up to 30% of 1990 levels by 2030. So all these countries have undertaken and are set to meet their commitments. Where the president might have a point though, is in the scale of these countries' efforts, which have all been rated as ""highly insufficient"" if the world is to avoid dangerous warming. However, the real strength of the Paris agreement was to get every country to commit to doing something, however paltry, and then use peer pressure to ratchet up those commitments over time. Strong winds and low humidity have been hampering efforts to keep the fires under control. Authorities in California, where 25 people have died since 15 August, report that firefighters are working to tackle ""hot spots"" to allow some residents to return to several neighbourhoods in areas near San Francisco. State officials have also warned that while storms forecast for later in the week could bring much-needed rainfall, they could also bring more lightning. Thousands of homes and other properties have been destroyed in California, Oregon and Washington state, and large areas of land have been covered with ash. This video can not be played Drone footage shows homes completely wiped out by wildfires At least 10 people have been killed in Oregon in the past week. Officials have said dozens of people are missing and warned that the death toll could rise. Police in Oregon have set up the state's first ever mobile mortuary,external, the Oregonian newspaper reports. The report adds that a separate facility is being created to allow the families of those reported missing to undergo DNA testing to help with the identification process. One person has died in Washington, where there were five large fires on Sunday. Speaking at a meeting with Mr Trump on Monday, California Governor Gavin Newsom acknowledged that ""we have not done justice on our forest management"", but he said that more than half of the land in California was under federal, not state control. The state itself owns just three per cent, with the rest owned by private individuals or companies or Native American groups. But he echoed his own statement from Friday thatthe fires showed the debate about climate change was ""over"". ""The hots are getting hotter, the dries are getting drier,"" he said. ""We submit the science is in and observed evidence is self-evident: that climate change is real and that is exacerbating this."" In pictures: Oregon fires force thousands to flee Smoke from California wildfires turns skies orange False claims about Oregon fires spread online A really simple guide to climate change Oregon Governor Kate Brown has said her state is facing ""the perfect firestorm"" and called the moment ""truly the bellwether for climate change on the West Coast"". ""And this is a wake-up call for all of us that we have got to do everything in our power to tackle climate change,"" she said. Six of the 20 largest fires on record in California have all occurred this year Washington Governor Jay Inslee described the situation as ""apocalyptic"" and condemned Mr Trump's stance on the climate. Nine of the world's 10 warmest years on record have occurred since 2005, and the UN warned this week that the five years from 2016 until this year will very probably be the hottest such period yet recorded. Both Oregon and California have warmed by more than 1C since 1900. This video can not be played Five ways that show the scale of California's 2020 wildfires The sustained warmth has seen six of the 20 largest fires on record in California all occur this year. In Oregon, the spate of fires burned almost twice the amount of average annual losses in a week. In California, a prolonged drought over the past decade has killed millions of trees, turning them into potent fuel for the fires. Mountain regions that are normally cooler and wetter have dried out more rapidly in the summer, adding to the potential fuel load.

"Six the Musical will be at the Lyric theatre in London from 14 November Six and Everybody's Talking About Jamie will become the first musicals back in the West End in mid-November, eight months after the curtain came down. They will hit the stage three weeks after a string of non-musical shows reopen London's theatre district. The Play That Goes Wrong, Agatha Christie's The Mousetrap and Adam Kay's This Is Going To Hurt will all admit socially distant audiences in October. Venue bosses said ""robust risk mitigation"" would be in place. They include reduced capacities, contactless tickets, temperature tests and deep cleans, as well as hand sanitation, face coverings and track and trace. Everybody's Talking About Jamie is expected to return to the Apollo Theatre in November The producers of Six, the hit show about Henry VIII's wives, will take a separate cast to The Lowry in Salford from late November. The musical had been due to be staged in the Greater Manchester venue's 450-capacity Quays theatre over Christmas, but will move into the complex's 1,700-seater Lyric in order to accommodate all ticket holders while ensuring social distancing. Lloyd Webber says arts are at 'point of no return' What is it like going back to the theatre? The socially distanced show must go on - is it fun? âââââ The queens will hit Salford two weeks after they return to the West End at another Lyric Theatre - on Shaftesbury Avenue - on 14 November. ""We are reconfiguring the entire stalls to absolutely comply with social distancing,"" Nimax Theatres boss Nica Burns told BBC Breakfast. Promising more legroom as one positive consequence of the new set-up, she added: ""We're taking out some of the rows. We feel very sure that we'll be able to keep this venue safe for our audiences."" The Apollo was covered in tape as part of the Live Theatre Missing campaign in July Most of the shows that have announced their reopening plans so far will be staged at Nimax venues. Producers hope Everybody's Talking About Jamie will resume at the Apollo in November, but the group's biggest production - Harry Potter and the Cursed Child at the Palace - will not return until at least February. ""It's impossible to open a large show with social distancing,"" Burns said. ""These shows are very, very expensive and you simply can't meet your weekly costs. So we have to do smaller shows."" The company said it would be operating at a loss after the furlough scheme ends at the end of October. ""We looked at the financial and human cost of large-scale redundancies,"" a statement said. ""We preferred to put the potential redundancy monies towards employment rather than unemployment."" The Nimax plans will save 355 jobs. Separately, Six's producers said the two productions in London and Salford would account for 100 jobs. This video can not be played Behind the scenes at the Arts Theatre in London to meet the sassy women in King Henry VIII's life One of the producers, Kenny Wax, called for news from the government about insurance and a date to welcome audiences without social distancing. ""We're desperate for some news on a government-backed insurance scheme, which would enable the bigger shows to open,"" he told BBC Breakfast. ""That's one of the answers, and the second is the crucial thing, which is stage five of [Culture Secretary] Oliver Dowden's five-point plan, which is no social distancing. Those two things are the things that are going to get all of the West End back open, which of course drives tourism and the economy."" A smattering of theatres have already reopened, including the Troubadour in Wembley, north London, where a musical based on the film Sleepless In Seattlehad its world premiere in August.

"UK-based computer chip designer ARM Holdings is being sold to the American graphics chip specialist Nvidia. The deal values ARM at $40bn (Â£31.2bn), four years after it was bought by Japanese conglomerate Softbank for $32bn. ARM's technology is at the heart of most smartphones, among many other devices. Nvidia has promised,externalto keep the business based in the UK, to hire more staff, and to retain ARM's brand. It added that the deal would create ""the premier computing company for the age of artificial intelligence"" (AI). ""ARM will remain headquartered in Cambridge,"" said Nvidia's chief executive Jensen Huang. ""We will expand on this great site and build a world-class AI research facility, supporting developments in healthcare, life sciences, robotics, self-driving cars and other fields."" This video can not be played WATCH: Nvidia chief explains why he wants to buy ARM A number of business leaders have signed anopen letter calling on the Prime Minister to stop the merger,external. A senior government source told the BBC that it would not block the sale, but said conditions could be imposed on the takeover. Softbank made commitments to secure jobs and keep ARM's headquarters in the UK until September next year. ""So far, when you read the announcement coming from Nvidia they said they will honour that Softbank has made at the time,"" said Sonja Laud, chief investment officer at Legal & General Investment Management. ""But with the expiry about to happen and obviously the Brexit negotiations under way it will be very interesting to see how this develops in the future."" This appears to address concerns that British jobs would be lost and decision-making shifted to the US. Last week,the Labour Party had urged the government to intervene. But two of ARM's co-founders have raised other issues about the takeover. Hermann Hauser and Tudor Brown had suggested ARM should remain ""neutral"", rather than be owned by a company like Nvidia, which produces its own processors. The concern is that there would be a conflict of interest since ARM's clients would become dependent on a business with which many also compete for sales. Moreover, the two co-founders also claimed that once ARM was owned by an American firm, Washington could try to block Chinese companies from using its knowhow as part of a wider trade clash between the countries. Hermann Hauser (left) and Tudor Brown (right) have warned the takeover would have negative consequences ""If ARM becomes a US subsidiary of a US company, it falls under the Cfius [Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States] regulations,"" Mr Hauser told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. ""[That] means that if hundreds of UK companies that incorporate ARM's [technology] in their products, want to sell it, and export it to anywhere in the world including China - which is a major market - the decision on whether they will be allowed to export it will be made in the White House and not in Downing Street."" He added that he believed the pledge to retain and increase the number of UK jobs was ""meaningless"" unless UK ministers stepped in to make it legally enforceable. ARM: Can 'crown jewel' of UK technology be protected? ARM's sale could put tech sector 'in jeopardy' Chinese chip giant 'in shock' after US trade ban threat But ARM's chief executive played down the threat of export bans. ""It isn't to do with the ownership of the company, it's all to do with analysis of the product itself,"" Simon Segars told the BBC. ""The majority of our products are designed in the UK or outside the US, and the majority of our products don't fall under much of the US export control set of rules."" Mr Huang added that ARM had ""some of the finest computer scientists in the world"" in Cambridge and he intended to both retain them and attract others to what would become Nvidia's largest site in Europe. The UK prime minister's spokesman said ""ministers have spoken to both companies"", adding that the government would be scrutinising the deal ""including what it means for the Cambridge HQ"". ARM creates computer chip designs that others then customise to their own ends. It also develops instruction sets, which define how software controls processors. It is based in Cambridge but also has offices across the world, including a joint venture in Shenzhen, China. Hundreds of companies license its innovations including Apple, Samsung, Huawei and Qualcomm. To date, ARM says 180 billion chips have been made based on its solutions. When Softbank acquired ARM, it promised to keep the company's headquarters in the UK and to increase the number of local jobs, which it did. Softbank's founder Masayoshi Son described the firm as being a ""crystal ball"" that would help him predict where tech was heading. But losses on other investments, including the office rental company WeWork, prompted a rethink. California-headquartered Nvidia overtook Intel to become the world's most valuable chipmaker in July. Until now, it has specialised in high-end graphics processing units (GPUs). These are commonly used by gamers to deliver more detailed visuals, as well as by professionals for tasks including scientific research, machine learning, and cryptocurrency ""mining"". Nvidia is also one of ARM's clients, using its designs to create its line-up of Tegra central processing units (CPUs). Under the terms of the deal, Nvidia will pay Softbank $21.5bn in its own stock and $12bn in cash. It will follow with up to a further $5bn in cash or stock if certain targets are met. Nvidia will also issue $1.5bn in equity to ARM's employees. Mr Huang has already said that one of the changes he wants to make is to accelerate development of ARM's designs for CPUs used in computer servers - a rapidly growing sector. Amazon is amongcompanies that are already betting on the tech,external. The use of internet-based services has led to ever-growing demand for computer servers But experts say one risk Nvidia faces is that the takeover could encourage ARM's wider client list to shift focus to a rival type of chip technology, which lags behind in terms of adoption but has the benefit of not being controlled by one company. ""ARM is facing growing competition from RISC-V, an open-source architecture,""wrote CCS Insight's Geoff Blaber in a recent research note,external. ""If its partners believed that ARM's integrity and independence was compromised, it would accelerate the growth of RISC-V and in the process devalue ARM."" Mr Blaber also suggested regulators might block the deal. ""This process will take months if not years with a high chance of failure,"" he told the BBC. Mr Huang has said that he expects it to take more than a year to ""educate"" regulators and answer all their questions, but said he had ""every confidence"" they would ultimately approve the investment. It's a deal which the man who founded ARM says is a disaster. And many in the UK's technology industry will agree with Hermann Hauser. He opposed the 2016 sale of the chip designer to Softbank but accepted that the Japanese firm stood by its guarantees to boost employment and research in Cambridge. But a takeover by Nvidia, one of the many firms that licences ARM's designs, appears to pose a threat to its business model - why will its hundreds of other customers now have faith that they will have equal access to its technology? In recent days leading figures in the Cambridge technology sector have lobbied Downing Street, calling for ministers to intervene to bring ARM back under UK ownership. There have been signs that the government is considering a more active industrial policy. Dominic Cummings, who has talked of the need for the UK to have a trillion dollar tech company, is leading the drive for a more interventionist approach. Now, with Hermann Hauser and others warning that this deal will make Britain a US vassal state, the government is under pressure to step in and ensure that control over vital home-grown technology is not lost to a foreign power.

About 3,000 undertakers in South Africa have gone on strike over pay and working conditions. As part of the strike they're refusing to collect bodies from people's homes and hospitals, and are also not holding burials. Their union wants the government to set up a coronavirus relief fund for the industry. Undertakers have struggled with the increasing cost of burials during the pandemic, because of the need for personal protective equipment (PPE), sanitiser and other extra protective items. But officials say they're worried the strike will cause a significant risk to public health. Macy's department store is making its famous Thanksgiving Day Parade a television-only special presentation, with no in-person spectators, the company said in a joint statement with the City of New York. Instead of going around the traditional 2.5-mile route, this year the parade will be staged solely around the Herald Square area of Midtown Manhattan. The first parade was staged in 1924, and has been a major fixture on the US festive calendar ever since. In recent years, more than 3.5m people have lined the streets each year to watch the parade in person. Faced with a surging coronavirus outbreak and poor working conditions, medical staff from across Morocco have been staging protests over the past few weeks. The country reported a record 2,430 cases last Friday, and has seen more than 1,000 new cases every day since July. Meanwhile, medical unions say some intensive care units are overrun and other wards are full. Morocco's Health Ministry has tried to raise capacity by setting up field hospitals - tents with beds and oxygen - but some medics say the main problem is staff shortages, particularly in rural areas. Anas Qarim, a nurse working at a Covid-19 hospital in Meknes, told Reuters news agency that they had just three nurses and two doctors to treat 120 patients. ""Imagine wearing full protective gear in the summer heat working continuously for hours,"" he said. There could be a second national lockdown in Wales if people fail ""to reconsider the choices we're making"", the health minister has warned. Vaughan Gething warned the pattern of increasing cases was ""similar to the situation we faced in early February"" - and that national lockdown remained an option. The number of new coronavirus cases in Wales increased by 183 on Monday - the largest rise in daily cases since 19 May, bringing the total number of confirmed cases in the country to 19,573. It comes as the government in Wales introduces mandatory face masks in all indoor public spaces and restricts more than six people from an extended household from meeting inside. ""If there isn't a change in behaviour, we could well be not just seven weeks away from a national lockdown, it could potentially be much quicker,"" Mr Gething said.

Head teacher Alison Ramsay thanked parents for their ""understanding at this difficult time"".  As we told you earlier, there were a further 2,621 confirmed cases of coronavirus in the UK today - after three consecutive days with more than 3,000 positive tests. It means the seven-day average for daily infections now stands at 3,004. The marked rise in infections over the past week is in keeping with many other countries in Europe, notably Spain and France. Nine more deaths - within 28 days of a positive test - were reported by the UK government on Monday. Deaths remain low - compared to figures at the height of the lockdown in April and May - despite the current spike in infections. On average, there were 12 deaths a day over the past seven days. Six the Musical will be at the Lyric theatre in London from 14 November Everybody's Talking About Jamie and Six will become the first musicals back in London's West End in mid-November, eight months after the curtain came down.

But where else have cases been surging? Which countries are experiencing a second wave? And what about the US, which remains the country with both the highest number of cases and deaths? In the US, overall, the daily number of new cases is continuing to fall: Some European countries are experiencing second surges of cases of the virus, after getting their outbreaks under control over the summer: A number of countries outside Europe have experienced second surges, too. In Israel, the government is imposing a second national lockdown from Friday in an attempt to control the outbreak: And in some countries, cases have been rising steadily for months: Kat Kingsley said she would be wary of giving her details out again A woman said she was sent ""creepy"" messages by a city bus tour worker who got her details from her test-and-trace form. Kat Kingsley, 25, from Hayle in Cornwall, went on the Original Tour bus in Windsor on Thursday. On Sunday she received two messages from a member of staff at the company saying he wanted to see her. Original Tour said it had launched an investigation as it ""takes the matter extremely seriously"". Read more here Officials in Marseille say the city is facing a spike in coronavirus cases, and that hospitals are close to running out of space to treat people with the virus. All but four of Marseille's intensive care beds are in use, they say, and plans have been made to reallocate resources from other areas to deal with the increase in patients. The authorities have also imposed a number of new restrictions - including making it mandatory to wear masks outdoors in the worst-hit areas, and banning groups of more than 10 from meeting in beaches and parks. Cases have been surging across France. This weekend, the country reporteda single-day increase of more than 10,000 new coronavirus cases. Labour has accused the government of trying to ""exempt the bloodsport passions of their big donors"" from new coronavirus restrictions, after it emerged thatso-called 'rule of six' limitswould not apply to hunting. Government guidelines exempt activities shooting and paintball, as part of a wider exemption for sport that can be done with more than five others. Other activities which are excluded from the ""rule of six"" regulations include team sports such as football, hockey and netball. But shadow environment secretary Luke Pollard said: ""Across the country, people are struggling to get Covid-19 tests anywhere near their homes. ""But the Conservatives are distracted with trying to exempt the bloodsport passions of their big donors from coronavirus regulations. ""It shows where this Government's priorities really lie."" As we reported earlier, the World Health Organization (WHO) has said there has been a record single-day rise in the number of new coronavirus cases. According to the WHO, 307,930 new cases were reported over the past 24 hours. The biggest increases were in India, the US and Brazil. We've put together this chart showing where in the world cases are surging - and falling. Fewer than half of all coronavirus fines handed out in England and Wales since the end of March have been paid so far. Of the 19,171 fines handed out by police for breaching coronavirus restrictions, just 8,930 were paid. Figures published in the letter to the Justice Committee revealed 8,954 fixed penalty notices - 8,325 in England and 629 in Wales - have not been paid within the 28-day payment period, meaning prosecution may follow. Another 1,287 unpaid fines are still pending. Police were given powers to fine people for breaching coronavirus restrictions from 27 March, following the lockdown on 23 March. There have been 2,621 new cases of coronavirus recorded across the UK. It marks a fall of more than 600 cases on Sunday's figures, when 3,330 positive cases were recorded. However weekend figures are often lower, due to delays in reporting. A further nine deaths have been recorded since 09:00 on Sunday, bringing the total reported death toll across the UK to 41,628. A death is anyone who dies within 28 days of testing positive for Covid-19. This video can not be played How not to wear a face mask Does it matter if you wear your face mask wrong? Well, yes. Wearing a face mask or covering incorrectly can make it easier for coronavirus to spread. From today it is compulsory to wear face coverings in shops and indoor places in Wales for everyone aged 11 and over. Face coverings must also be worn in shops, supermarkets and shopping centres in England, Scotland and Northern Ireland. Read

school for millions of Italian children today. I grew up learning the three Rs, but today Italian children have to know the three Ms: Mascherina, Mani, Metro (mask,
hands, metre). There was the usual mix of first-day excitement and nerves. Ten-year-old
Gabriele posed joyfully for a photo with his classmates in masks. His mother,
an A&E doctor, was impressed to see them greeting each other with elbow
bumps â not the usual bear hugs. ""The parents were far less disciplined,"" she
remarked. My seven-year-old is relieved to return to proper lessons
with teachers, instead of ""full-time homework"". But she is sad that coronavirus
means ""it's never going to be the same"". She's worried about playtime - ""what
happens when it rains?"" - and nervous about all the new rules. So are the
parents. Which entrance will they use? What if you have two kids at
the school? Borrowing in class is banned and everything has to be name-labelled.
Each individual pencil?! Masks can only be removed once children are seated at their
desks. At our school, washable masks aren't allowed: they must be surgical,
changed daily, and for now provided by the parents. Disappointingly, our class sizes haven't been reduced or
classrooms extended. Pigeon holes have simply been removed to make room to
space out the desks. Despite our worries, my daughter is looking on the bright side: ""At least nobody can nick my pencil sharpener."" Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking.",Positive,0.9986349
"Nicola Sturgeon has voiced ""very serious concerns"" about an apparent backlog of coronavirus test results. The Scottish first minister said she was seeking ""urgent discussions"" with UK ministers over delays to results. Only 70 new positive cases of the virus were confirmed in Scotland on Monday, compared with 244 on Sunday. Ms Sturgeon said the figures were ""not yet complete"", and suggested that schools going back in England could be causing a spike in demand for tests. Thesystem in Scotland was hit by ""exceptional demand""when pupils returned to schools in August. The Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) said a ""significant"" number of people had been seeking tests, including some ""who do not have symptoms and are not otherwise eligible"" - but that capacity was at its highest level ever. Live: Latest on coronavirus in Scotland New rules limit social gatherings to six people The ""vast bulk"" of Scotland's coronavirus testing is carried out as part of a UK-wide network of test centres and mobile testing units, with the results processed in Lighthouse labs such as the one in Glasgow. Ms Sturgeon said the Scottish government had been ""fully engaged and involved in that system"", and wanted to work ""in partnership with the UK government"" to solve any problems. However, amid reports of a backlog of tests, she said UK ministers needed to ""share the scale and nature of the issues"" so that ""we can collectively and very quickly find solutions"". Ms Sturgeon said: ""We now have a very serious concern that the backlog of test results being faced by the UK lab network is starting to impact on the timeous reporting of Scottish results. ""We have reason to be concerned that the figures that have been reported today are not complete, because some of the turnaround of the tests done in Scotland over yesterday is longer. ""I'll be seeking urgent discussions later today with UK government counterparts just to make sure we are doing everything possible to get on top of this before it becomes a bigger issue."" On Sunday, the DHSC said the Test and Trace system was working and that ""our capacity is the highest it has ever been"". However, it added: ""We are seeing a significant demand for tests, including from people who do not have symptoms and are not otherwise eligible. ""New booking slots and home testing kits are made available daily for those who need them and we are targeting testing capacity at the areas that need it most, including those where there is an outbreak, and prioritising at-risk groups. ""Our laboratories are processing more than a million tests a week and we recently announced new facilities and technology to process results even faster."" At her daily coronavirus briefing, the first minister said Scotland was in a ""precarious situation"". Even with a lower number of positive results on Monday, they still represented 2.7% of people tested. A few weeks ago that figure was usually around or below 1%. Ms Sturgeon said the number of new cases was trebling roughly every three weeks, a pattern which is ""not sustainable"". Newrestrictions on the number of people who can meet upwere imposed on Monday, limiting gatherings to six people from two households. Ms Sturgeon said: ""We have to act now, we have to act quickly to prevent and even greater increase in cases as we go through autumn and into winter.""

"The bomb was detonated at the end of an Ariana Grande concert, killing 22 people Bereaved families whose loved ones were killed in the Manchester Arena attack have shared their heartache as the inquiry heads into its second week. The father of Martyn Hett was the first to present a ""pen portrait"" of his son, whose ""memory will shine brightly"". The portraits will give each family the chance to present a personal insight into the lives of those who died. Twenty-two people were killed when Salman Abedi detonated a bomb as 14,000 fans left the arena in May 2017. The inquiry comes more than three years after the bombing at the end of an Ariana Grande concert, which left hundreds more injured. What is the Manchester Arena inquiry? It was due to start in June, but was delayed by the trial of Abedi's brother Hashem,who was jailed for at least 55 years for 22 murders on 20 August. The inquiry is being held at Manchester Magistrates' Court, less than a mile away from where the bombing happened. The ""pen portraits"" will be provided by family members, or others on their behalf, reading out witness statements and playing music and videos to remember those who died. Tributes were left in in St Ann's Square in Manchester city centre in the wake of the bombing Paul Greaney QC, counsel to the inquiry, said they would ""ensure the deceased and their families are at the centre of this process"". ""Each 'pen portrait' is deeply affecting. The experience will be moving and distressing... and exceptionally difficult for the families,"" he added. During the first ""pen portrait"", the inquiry hearda moving testimony from Mr Hett's father Paul. ""How would I describe Martyn's personality in one simple word? Fun. He had the most wicked sense of humour,"" Mr Hett said. The 29-year-old, from Stockport, Greater Manchester, ""lit up everyone around him"", his father added. Martyn Hett, pictured centre, was ""so vibrant, so full of energy"" The family of John Atkinson, 28, from Radcliffe in Bury, told the public inquiry he had a ""massively addictive personality"" andhis ""smile would light the room up"". ""He loved everyone and everyone loved him,"" his parents Kevan and Daryl said. ""He was the centre of our world."" ""He was the centre of our world,"" said John Atkinson's parents Eilidh MacLeod, 14, from the Isle of Barra, was described as a ""bundle of fun"" with""perfect quips, one-liners and an infectious laugh"". The teenager, who loved playing the bagpipes, was ""growing into a lovely young woman with this fantastic gift she was able to express herself with"", her father Roderick said. Her former primary school teacher Michelle McLean said: ""The whole island community misses her - as her teacher she taught me to be a better person."" Eilidh MacLeod was described as a ""bundle of fun"" Sorrell Leczkowski was ""hungry for knowledge"" anddreamed of studying in New York to fulfil her ambition to become an architect, her mother told the inquiry. The 14-year-old had gone to the Manchester Arena with her family to collect her sister who was at the concert. Her mother Samantha and grandmother Pauline were both seriously injured. Sorrell Leczkowski dreamed of studying in New York The commemorative hearings are expected to conclude on 23 September. The inquiry was set up to examine the background to the attack and the response of the emergency services. Its chairman, Sir John Saunders, will make a report and recommendations once all the evidence has been heard, which is expected to take up to six months.

"The small town of Leighton Buzzard has experienced two earthquakes within a week Leighton Buzzard residents have felt a second earthquake within a week. The British Geological Survey (BGS) said a 2.1-magnitude tremor was felt in the Bedfordshire town at 00:20 BST on Monday. It comes after a 3.5-magnitude earthquake hit the town on Tuesday. The BGS tweeted there had been ""a small number of reports"" from the public with one saying this earthquake ""felt slower and less intense"". One Twitter user said: ""What is going on??? Just woken by another earthquake in Leighton Buzzard!"" Leighton Linslade Town Council mayor Dave Bowater said he slept through the second quake, but the first had been ""a little bit frightening"". ""We've had two now and the experts say that is one and the aftershock,"" he said. ""We should be done now."" Mr Bowater, who once spent 10 days living on the 14th floor of a hotel in Tokyo while a number of four and above-magnitude earthquakes took place, said he was surprised to experience two in Leighton Buzzard. ""It brings things sharply into focus when you can be hit that strongly out of the blue,"" he said. The first earthquakestruck just north of Leighton Buzzardand was also felt in Dunstable, Bedfordshire, and Milton Keynes and Aylesbury in Buckinghamshire. A BGS spokesman said the second tremor was more than 100 times smaller than the first. He said it ""could have occurred because all the stress in the rocks was not relieved"" or because the first earthquake ""caused a slight change to the stress regime in that location"".

"UK-based computer chip designer ARM Holdings is being sold to the American graphics chip specialist Nvidia. The deal values ARM at $40bn (Â£31.2bn), four years after it was bought by Japanese conglomerate Softbank for $32bn. ARM's technology is at the heart of most smartphones, among many other devices. Nvidia has promised,externalto keep the business based in the UK, to hire more staff, and to retain ARM's brand. It added that the deal would create ""the premier computing company for the age of artificial intelligence"" (AI). ""ARM will remain headquartered in Cambridge,"" said Nvidia's chief executive Jensen Huang. ""We will expand on this great site and build a world-class AI research facility, supporting developments in healthcare, life sciences, robotics, self-driving cars and other fields."" This video can not be played WATCH: Nvidia chief explains why he wants to buy ARM A number of business leaders have signed anopen letter calling on the Prime Minister to stop the merger,external. A senior government source told the BBC that it would not block the sale, but said conditions could be imposed on the takeover. Softbank made commitments to secure jobs and keep ARM's headquarters in the UK until September next year. ""So far, when you read the announcement coming from Nvidia they said they will honour that Softbank has made at the time,"" said Sonja Laud, chief investment officer at Legal & General Investment Management. ""But with the expiry about to happen and obviously the Brexit negotiations under way it will be very interesting to see how this develops in the future."" This appears to address concerns that British jobs would be lost and decision-making shifted to the US. Last week,the Labour Party had urged the government to intervene. But two of ARM's co-founders have raised other issues about the takeover. Hermann Hauser and Tudor Brown had suggested ARM should remain ""neutral"", rather than be owned by a company like Nvidia, which produces its own processors. The concern is that there would be a conflict of interest since ARM's clients would become dependent on a business with which many also compete for sales. Moreover, the two co-founders also claimed that once ARM was owned by an American firm, Washington could try to block Chinese companies from using its knowhow as part of a wider trade clash between the countries. Hermann Hauser (left) and Tudor Brown (right) have warned the takeover would have negative consequences ""If ARM becomes a US subsidiary of a US company, it falls under the Cfius [Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States] regulations,"" Mr Hauser told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. ""[That] means that if hundreds of UK companies that incorporate ARM's [technology] in their products, want to sell it, and export it to anywhere in the world including China - which is a major market - the decision on whether they will be allowed to export it will be made in the White House and not in Downing Street."" He added that he believed the pledge to retain and increase the number of UK jobs was ""meaningless"" unless UK ministers stepped in to make it legally enforceable. ARM: Can 'crown jewel' of UK technology be protected? ARM's sale could put tech sector 'in jeopardy' Chinese chip giant 'in shock' after US trade ban threat But ARM's chief executive played down the threat of export bans. ""It isn't to do with the ownership of the company, it's all to do with analysis of the product itself,"" Simon Segars told the BBC. ""The majority of our products are designed in the UK or outside the US, and the majority of our products don't fall under much of the US export control set of rules."" Mr Huang added that ARM had ""some of the finest computer scientists in the world"" in Cambridge and he intended to both retain them and attract others to what would become Nvidia's largest site in Europe. The UK prime minister's spokesman said ""ministers have spoken to both companies"", adding that the government would be scrutinising the deal ""including what it means for the Cambridge HQ"". ARM creates computer chip designs that others then customise to their own ends. It also develops instruction sets, which define how software controls processors. It is based in Cambridge but also has offices across the world, including a joint venture in Shenzhen, China. Hundreds of companies license its innovations including Apple, Samsung, Huawei and Qualcomm. To date, ARM says 180 billion chips have been made based on its solutions. When Softbank acquired ARM, it promised to keep the company's headquarters in the UK and to increase the number of local jobs, which it did. Softbank's founder Masayoshi Son described the firm as being a ""crystal ball"" that would help him predict where tech was heading. But losses on other investments, including the office rental company WeWork, prompted a rethink. California-headquartered Nvidia overtook Intel to become the world's most valuable chipmaker in July. Until now, it has specialised in high-end graphics processing units (GPUs). These are commonly used by gamers to deliver more detailed visuals, as well as by professionals for tasks including scientific research, machine learning, and cryptocurrency ""mining"". Nvidia is also one of ARM's clients, using its designs to create its line-up of Tegra central processing units (CPUs). Under the terms of the deal, Nvidia will pay Softbank $21.5bn in its own stock and $12bn in cash. It will follow with up to a further $5bn in cash or stock if certain targets are met. Nvidia will also issue $1.5bn in equity to ARM's employees. Mr Huang has already said that one of the changes he wants to make is to accelerate development of ARM's designs for CPUs used in computer servers - a rapidly growing sector. Amazon is amongcompanies that are already betting on the tech,external. The use of internet-based services has led to ever-growing demand for computer servers But experts say one risk Nvidia faces is that the takeover could encourage ARM's wider client list to shift focus to a rival type of chip technology, which lags behind in terms of adoption but has the benefit of not being controlled by one company. ""ARM is facing growing competition from RISC-V, an open-source architecture,""wrote CCS Insight's Geoff Blaber in a recent research note,external. ""If its partners believed that ARM's integrity and independence was compromised, it would accelerate the growth of RISC-V and in the process devalue ARM."" Mr Blaber also suggested regulators might block the deal. ""This process will take months if not years with a high chance of failure,"" he told the BBC. Mr Huang has said that he expects it to take more than a year to ""educate"" regulators and answer all their questions, but said he had ""every confidence"" they would ultimately approve the investment. It's a deal which the man who founded ARM says is a disaster. And many in the UK's technology industry will agree with Hermann Hauser. He opposed the 2016 sale of the chip designer to Softbank but accepted that the Japanese firm stood by its guarantees to boost employment and research in Cambridge. But a takeover by Nvidia, one of the many firms that licences ARM's designs, appears to pose a threat to its business model - why will its hundreds of other customers now have faith that they will have equal access to its technology? In recent days leading figures in the Cambridge technology sector have lobbied Downing Street, calling for ministers to intervene to bring ARM back under UK ownership. There have been signs that the government is considering a more active industrial policy. Dominic Cummings, who has talked of the need for the UK to have a trillion dollar tech company, is leading the drive for a more interventionist approach. Now, with Hermann Hauser and others warning that this deal will make Britain a US vassal state, the government is under pressure to step in and ensure that control over vital home-grown technology is not lost to a foreign power.

"The information was online for 20 hours before being taken down The details of more than 18,000 people who tested positive for coronavirus were published online by mistake by Public Health Wales. The health body said the data of 18,105 Welsh residents was viewable online for 20 hours on 30 August. Most cases gave initials, date of birth, geographical area and sex, meaning the risk of identification was low, Public Health Wales (PHW) said. However 1,928 people in living in communal settings were more at risk. Nursing home residents or those living in supported housing also had the name of their place of residence published, meaning the risk, while still considered low, was higher. The incident was the result of ""individual human error"" when the information was uploaded to a public server searchable by anyone using the site. PHW said the information had been viewed 56 times before it was removed but there was no evidence so far that the data had been misused. Anyone with concerns can contact Public Health Wales for help Chief executive Tracey Cooper told BBC Wales the failure was one of the ""biggest data breaches"" she had come across and said it ""should never have happened"". Dr Cooper also said Public Health Wales could have acted more quickly in removing the information. The person who was alerted to the breach on the evening of 30 August after the information was posted at 14:00 that day did not follow the body's serious incident reporting procedures. The data was not removed until 09:55 the next morning. Finding out why is part of the terms of reference of an external investigation which will be carried out by NHS Wales Informatics Service. ""I think we should have taken it down quicker,"" she said. Tracey Cooper said it was one of the biggest data breaches she had come across The team that ""takes data protection responsibilities extremely seriously"" was ""devastated that this has happened"", Ms Cooper said. ""I can't apologise enough because on this occasion we failed."" Dr Cooper said she was not considering resigning, saying: ""I'm the person who is accountable and as chief executive that's where the buck stops. ""I want to get to the bottom of it so I'm not at this stage [considering my position]."" PHW said it had already taken steps, including making sure any data uploads were now undertaken by a senior team member. Welsh Conservative spokesman on health, Andrew RT Davies MS, said: ""I acknowledge that the risk is considered to be 'low', but I'm not sure that that will be much comfort to the nearly 2,000 residents of care homes or other enclosed settings whose - albeit limited - information was posted along with their place of residence. ""The health minister appears to have sat on this for two weeks and done a press conference earlier today without disclosing this significant failing - and that's unacceptable."" His Plaid Cymru counterpart, Rhun ap Iorwerth MS, said: ""Any data breach is serious, and this data breach including potential means of identifying patients is of serious concern. ""Public Health Wales and the Welsh Government have to be able to explain how exactly this happened, and give assurances that this can't happen again.""

"This video can not be played Pupils at Olfcha Comprehensive get used to new systems at school Groups of children being told to self-isolate due to school Covid cases is to be expected, according to the education minister. Since term began, dozens of schools have reported cases and entire year groups have self-isolated. Pupils are being grouped together in ""bubbles"" in an attempt to limit the spread of the virus in the case of an outbreak. Kirsty Williams thanked affected schools for their ""immediate action"". After a staggered start to the term, all year groups are due back full time from Monday. Government guidance to schools says they should group pupils together and avoid contact between groups as much as possible, but how this is done will depend on each individual school. Public Health Wales data released at the end of last week indicated that there had been 36 cases in 31 schools. All Year 7 children at two Newport secondary schools were told to self-isolate after pupils tested positive for coronavirus and a Bridgend school told more than 200 pupils to stay at home. But the number of schools has risen over the weekend and it is believed it could be closer to 50. In Cardiff, eight pupils and three members of staff from Llanishen Fach Primary School have been asked to self-isolate. Another 57 pupils and two staff members from Whitchurch High School are also self isolating. A Welsh Government spokesperson said the operational guidance for schools made it clear that ""small, consistent groups help reduce the risk of transmission by limiting the number of learners and staff in contact with each other"". At Olchfa Comprehensive School in Swansea, head teacher Hugh Davies believes they are well-prepared. The school's 1,800 pupils are being organised in separate groups in six learning zones. ""Essentially what we're doing here is making sure that children of different age groups are kept separate - this is the idea that you might have heard of as the bubble,"" he said. ""So in our school's case we have six learning zones...and the idea is that those pupils come in separately at the start of the day, they take their breaks separately, they eat separately, they go home separately and therefore tracking and tracing can work more effectively if, God forbid, we had an outbreak. ""I think the name of the game at this point has to be to stay as calm as you can, to respond to events as they occur and just deal with them in a calm way."" Gagany, 14, said: ""At first I was quite anxious to go back because I thought there was no security measures put into place for school, because in Olchfa there is a lot of students and it's quite impossible to social distance everyone. ""But I think they found a method to find a good way to socially distancing everyone and we have our own bubble, so we stick to our bubble and we have a learning zone. ""By following these measures it keeps everyone safe and secure from the virus."" Max, 14, said: ""I think it's definitely taken a lot of getting used to, especially coming to school - there's certain gates we have to come through and zones you have to go through, rules you have to abide by. ""But I think anyone who's been alive in the last six months would understand how Covid works and the reasons we're taking the safety measures and I think that as long as everything's in place it's the best for everyone."" Danny, 14, said: ""They are very straightforward rules. ""Moving classroom to classroom you do notice it if you are paying attention to everything around, but the teaching hasn't changed. It's gone really smoothly."" Thomas, 14, said: ""I was initially quite worried... through lockdown up until we came back. But since we came back I've got more confident and it's a new normal, so we have obviously been in our bubbles and we've adapted to that very easily."" What are the rules on school buses in Wales?

"From today, face masks have to be worn in shops in Wales by everyone aged 11 and over No more than six people from extended households can meet indoors at any one time, not counting children aged 10 and under However, an intensive care doctor warns the new rules and lockdowns may have come too late to prevent a second wave of the pandemic Groups of children being told to self-isolate due to school Covid cases is to be expected, says Education Minister Kirsty Williams The details of more than 18,000 people who tested positive for coronavirus were published online by mistake, Public Health Wales has revealed David Dulin and Andy Roberts That brings an end to our live page coverage of the Welsh Government's briefing on the coronavirus pandemic. Health Minister Vaughan Gething said a lockdown could be less than seven weeks away unless people changed their behaviour. He said a spike in Newport was due to a house party on bank holiday weekend. It comes on the day:  We'll keep you updated on further developments via the BBC Wales News website and social media channels. The details of more than 18,000 people who tested positive for coronavirus werepublished online by mistakeby Public Health Wales, it has revealed. The health body said the data of 18,105 Welsh residents was viewable online for 20 hours on 30 August. Most cases gave initials, date of birth, geographical area and sex, meaning the risk of identification was low, Public Health Wales (PHW) said. However 1,928 people in living in communal settings were more at risk. Anyone with concerns can contact Public Health Wales for help There were 47 new cases in Caerphilly county borough which is under lockdown and 42 in Rhondda Cynon Taf. Newport was next with 14 new cases, then Cardiff with 12. Merthyr Tydfil - highlighted recently as another possible hotspot - had another six confirmed cases. There have beena further 183 cases of coronavirus confirmed in Wales, Public Health Wales has said. However, for the 13th day in a row, no new deaths have been reported. This video can not be played Coronavirus: Fears for extra needs pupils entering jobs market The head of the UK's biggest special education school has said he fears Covid-19 will make it even more difficult for his pupils to find jobs. Chris Britten, at Ysgol y Deri in Penarth, Vale of Glamorgan, said people with additional learning needs faced an even greater struggle for meaningful work. Employers, he said, would likely be ""swamped"" with applicants. The school of 200 pupils aged between three and 19 is featured in a new documentary series. A Special Schoolcan be seen tonight at 20:30 BST on BBC One Wales, with all three episodes available on the BBC iPlayer after the first programme has aired. Keeping out of lockdown ""depends on the choices that each one of us is prepared to make"", Health Minister Vaughan Gething said. He told Monday's Welsh Government press conference that while cases were kept low during the summer, the autumn poses a challenge. ""The challenge comes back to how we've chosen to behave through the summer and going into the autumn,"" he said. ""We suppressed coronavirus pretty significantly through the summer, we were in a position with low levels of transmission to have further easements. ""The challenge is that we've seen some people relaxing too much perhaps and small instances where people know that they're breaking the rules, and in particular larger social gatherings in people's homes, and a couple of businesses that have not enforced the rules in terms of where their customers behave. ""Now that's a challenge for us and we see as I said in Caerphilly the infection rate has moved so more people over 40 and over 50 are testing positive. ""Their risks of harm are much greater than fit and healthy people in their teens and twenties so the risks are there. ""And of course it's about what our health and social care system prepares for what might come through the autumn, and the winter, and that's entirely the right thing to do our ability to keep out of lockdown depends on the choices that each one of us is prepared to make to help keep us safe."" Sarah DickinsBBC Wales Economics Correspondent For 40 years, June Phillips has been growing plants with her brother Steve and selling them at Abergavenny market in Monmouthshire. They have loyal customers, she says, made up of country people who come into town and valleys people from as far as Merthyr Tydfil. When Covid-19 closed the market they delivered to about 100 of their customers. The market has been open again for a month but she says shoppers aren't spending like they did before lockdown. ""They are buying but it's a lot quieter and people are still very nervous about coming out,"" she said. ""We are still delivering to about 50 people who are not confident that it is all over so it's going to take a long time to get back to normal."" Read moreabout how Abergavenny is surviving the pandemic. Chris DeardenBBC Wales News There is ""real concern"" aboutplans to reduce Covid-19 testing from weekly to fortnightly at care homes in north Wales, social services bosses have warned. In an email sent on behalf of managers in several counties, officials said the move was ""premature"", given that Wales could be ""heading towards a second wave"". Conservative Member of the Senedd Darren Millar condemned the proposal while Plaid Cymru said weekly tests must continue. The Welsh Government said it was taking steps to boost testing resources. Wales' health minister says there will be a network of field hospitals in place for coronavirus. A Â£33m facility is being built at the University Hospital of Wales in Cardiff asthe Dragonâs Heart hospital at the Principality Stadium is being decommissioned. Vaughan Gething said there would be field hospitals in each health board area with more detail on the arrangements to follow. He said whether or not the hospitals will be needed âdepends on the behaviour of the publicâ. Health Minister Vaughan Gething said Wales was in a ""much better position now"" than when the nation initially went into lockdown in March. While warning that the coronoavirus situation in Wales is currently similar to where it was in February, he said: ""We've signifcantly restocked our provision of PPE [personal protective equipment], we have a range of orders still to come but we're in a much better position now than previously. ""But even with that additional assurance, it's still the case that we don't want our health and social care staff using even more significant amounts of PPE, because we want to avoid more cases of covid coming into our health and care system. ""Even with that better provision and the assurance the public should take from that, it should not lead to risk-taking behaviour and avoiding or ignoring the rules."" Wales could have to lockdown in less than seven weeks' time if there is no change in behaviour, the health minister has warned. âIf we see cases continue to riseâ¦ then we may be in a position to make that decision and need to make that decision sooner than the seven-week period of time,"" Vaughan Gething said. âIt does, I think, say to the public there is a limited period of weeks for us to reconsider the choices we're making, and to behave in a different way, if we are to avoid more local lockdowns or a national lockdown.â He added: âYou want to engage with people to persuade people but ultimately if people want to break the rules, then theyâll find there are consequences that come from that.â The Welsh Government would impose other restrictions and closures before shutting schools if coronavirus worsens, Health Minister Vaughan Gething warned. Earlier steps could include restricting pubsâ opening hours. He said:
âWe want to keep schools open so other closures would take place first to protect our ability to keep children in school. âBecause we know the significant harm it does to children's wellbeing in the here and now, from having schools closed, as well as the harm to their future prospects.â Wales' Health Minister Vaugahn Gething said it is up to individuals and businesses to think carefully âabout the choices we makeâ when it comes to following Covid rules. Asked whether the Welsh Government has been too reliant on people's goodwill in following the rules, Mr Gething said there was âmore concerted action by local authorities across the countryâ. He said Caerphilly had increased its enforcement, adding: âI spoke with the leader of Newport today - theyâre increasing their enforcement activity."" In Rhondda Cynon Taf, a pub was closed in the last few days because it was not following the rules while enforcement notices have been issued against supermarkets. Mr Gething added: âSo itâs really important that businesses play their part.â But he said even if a business was doing what it should, customers still had choices about their behaviour. âThat means people not going into pubs and restaurants in more mixed groups,"" he said. ""Itâs important that we stick with the rules that weâve got about limiting our contact to our extended households. ""Otherwise we may not just see a large number of cases but all the consequences in closing down a range of businesses with consequences for peopleâs livelihoods.â Wales' health minister warned the testing problem at UK level needed to be resolved before the demand for tests surged ahead of the ""pinch point"" of a potential second peak. Vaughan Gething said: ""Autumn and winter is likely to be the most demanding period of time, with more coughs colds and other challenges that mimic the symptoms of coronavirus, as well as of course the pinch point of returning to school, universities returning, so this is happening in a particularly difficult time for all of us. ""But I don't think it's going to be resolved for a number of weeks, and that follows a constructive conversation that all four health ministers had at the end of last week. ""That's why we are moving part of our capacity from NHS Wales labs to make sure that mobile testing units are run through Welsh labs, to make sure we've got enough capacity if we do see further spikes to move those units around, whilst the lighthouse lab issues are being resolved."" When asked why the Welsh NHS was not using its whole testing capacity, Health Minister Vaughan Gething said the Welsh Government wanted to move ""more resources"" to where they understand there is a spike in cases. Mr Gething added that testing from the UK-wide Lighthouse Labs ""didn't properly account"" for outbreaks in heightened areas of concern. He said if more testing capacity was moved back to NHS Wales they could ""make choices about highest priority areas"" if they knew there was not going to be enough testing capacity. When asked why testing in north Wales care homes had been moved from weekly to fortnightly, the minister said north Wales had a ""very low incidence"" of tests coming back positive. Mr Gething added that in areas of concern including Caerphilly and Rhondda Cynon Taf more regular testing has been introduced and those county boroughs, along with Newport, had taken the decision to end visiting in care homes. New restrictions on who can meet up and where have come into force today across the UK. All four nations are following a ""rule of six"" on the maximum number which can meet indoors, but there are variations on the numbers for outdoor gatherings. In Wales, up to 30 people can still meet outdoors, but in England the number has been cut to six. Wales' health minister said there has been a change in the pattern of coronavirus infection in Caerphilly county borough. Vaughan Gething said more people in the 40s and 50s age brackets were testing positive, while there have been cases in care homes and people being admitted to hospital. But the situation in Merthyr Tydfil was ""more complex"". He added: ""There is a cluster of cases linked to people working in a company; we are also seeing cases linked to Caerphilly borough, as well as those associated with socialising and holiday travel."" On Rhondda Cynon Taf, he said the cases were largely centred on the lower Rhondda Valley and  linked to people socialising without social distancing and returning from holiday. ""We also have a small cluster of cases linked to a caravan park"", he added. Community coronavirus testing in the Rhondda area has been hampered by the ongoing issues with the UK governmentâs Lighthouse Lab system, according to Wales' health minister who said it ""plainly isn't acceptable"". Vaughan Gething added: ""Late on Friday night, the UK government made the unilateral decision to reduce the Lighthouse testing capacity at all mobile testing units in Wales, including in the Rhondda, to just 60. ""We intervened to increase this over the weekend. And crucially the health board, the local authority and the Welsh Ambulance Service also made extra testing capacity available to cope with the demand."" Mr Gething said there were also issues with people trying to book a test at drive-in centres but finding they were full or had to travel hundreds of miles for one. He said he had spoken to the UK government's health secretary Matt Hancock ""on several occasions over the weekend"" and they agreed immediate action ""to protect capacity in areas experiencing higher incidence and spikes and make sure restrictions are not placed on Wales again"". Mr Gething added that the Welsh Government was switching testing facilities to Welsh laboratories to increase capacity through the mobile testing units while the UK government resolves issues with the Lighthouse system. Health Minister Vaughan Gething said there has beena ""rapid rise"" in new cases in Newport, following a similar pattern to that in neighbouring Caerphilly county borough. Mr Gething added: ""At the heart of it appears to be a party over the bank holiday weekend, which led to 18 new cases of coronavirus, many of whom visited other venues on nights out while infectious. ""Public Health Wales yesterday asked people who had visited a list of bars and pubs in the city to be aware of the symptoms of coronavirus."" Coronavirus have risen sharply recently in Caerphilly county borough, Merthyr Tydfil, Rhondda Cynon Taf and Newport, according to Wales' health minister. Vaughan Gething said there were many similarities between the rises in each of the areas ""including socialising indoors and at home without social distancing, and imported cases from holiday travel"". He added the Welsh Government was looking at increasing the range of measures to tackle the outbreaks including the ""possible introduction"" of curfews, restricting alcohol sales and changing pub operations, including shorter opening hours or only selling alcohol with food.

"The humpback whale was found in Australia's East Alligator River Australian officials say they will try to guide a humpback whale out of a crocodile-infested river in the Northern Territory after it got lost and ended up 30km (18.5 miles) inland. The whale and others were on an annual sea migration when some of them ""took a wrong turn"", experts believe. Two whales were later able to swim out of the river, but at least one remains. It's the first known instance of a whale being found in crocodile territory so far inland in Australia. Given its estimated 16m (52 ft) length, the humpback is considered unlikely to be disturbed by crocodiles. But that risk could escalate if the whale were to become stranded in the shallow waters, officials said on Monday. The whales were spotted last week in the East Alligator River by people boating in the Kakadu National Park - Australia's biggest national park and a World Heritage-listed site. The sight of the animals swimming along the muddy bends of the river - so far from open water - has amazed locals. The whale swam about 30 km (18.5 miles) upstream ""It's something that's never been recorded before - not just in the Northern Territory - but [in] Australia. It's really, really unusual,"" said Carole Palmer, a marine ecosystems scientist for the territory's government. It was hard to determine if more than one whale needed assistance because of the river's ""murky brown water"", she added. Ms Palmer told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation that experts weren't sure ""why these whales took a wrong turn"" off the country's north coast. It is thought they had been heading south to Antarctica but mistakenly entered an estuary which took them further upstream into the river system. Whales migrate to warmer waters off Australia during spring to give birth before heading back to Antarctica to feed. Whale migration: Rare encounter on Great Barrier Reef Although the river teems with saltwater crocodiles, experts do not expect a confrontation. This video can not be played The East Alligator River connects to Cahills Crossing, a river bridge notorious in Kakadu for its proximity to crocodiles But if the whale becomes trapped in the shallow bends and washes up on a bank ""it's an easy feed for them,"" Ms Palmer told the ABC. ""There's no way we can lift a 12-16m humpback whale off the sandbar and that's potentially when the crocs would kick in."" To clear a path to the ocean, boats have been banned along part of the river. It had been hoped the whale would leave on its own, but it has remained around the deepest section of the river - about 20km from sea. Park rangers are trying to help the whale get out of the river system Ms Palmer said officials were considering several options to draw it out, such as using ""noisy sound"" from nearby boats or recordings of humpback whale calls. ""It's tricky on every level, but everyone is really trying to move forward with this in the most positive way that we can,"" she said. 'Super rare' whale encounter on Great Barrier Reef.

""It's impossible to open a large show with social distancing,"" Burns said. ""These shows are very, very expensive and you simply can't meet your weekly costs. So we have to do smaller shows."" The company said it would be operating at a loss after the furlough scheme ends at the end of October. ""We looked at the financial and human cost of large-scale redundancies,"" a statement said.

"Yoshihide Suga was born the son of strawberry farmers Japan's governing party has elected Yoshihide Suga as its new leader to succeed Shinzo Abe, meaning he is almost certain to become the country's next prime minister. Last month Mr Abe announced his resignation for reasons of ill health. Mr Suga, 71, serves as chief cabinet secretary in the current administration and was widely expected to win. He is considered a close ally of Mr Abe and likely to continue his predecessor's policies. Yoshihide Suga: The man set to be Japan's next PM Defining Shinzo Abe and his legacy Mr Suga won the vote for the presidency of the conservative Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) by a large margin, taking 377 of a total of 534 votes from lawmakers and regional representatives. He saw off two other contenders - Fumio Kishida, a former foreign minister, and Shigeru Ishiba, a former LDP secretary-general and one time defence minister. Shigeru Ishiba (left), Yoshihide Suga and Fumio Kishida Now that the party has chosen its new leader, there will be another vote on Wednesday in parliament, where Mr Suga is almost certain to be made prime minister because of the LDP's majority. Taking over mid-term, Mr Suga is expected to stay in post until elections due in September 2021. Born the son of strawberry farmers, Mr Suga is a veteran politician. Given his central role of chief cabinet secretary in the administration, he is expected to provide continuity heading an interim government until the 2021 election. ""Shinzo Abe and the other party bosses picked and joined the bandwagon for Mr Suga precisely because he was the best 'continuity' candidate, someone who they think could continue Abe government without Abe,"" Koichi Nakano, dean and political science professor at Tokyo's Sophia University, told the BBC. While not considered the most energetic or passionate politician, Mr Suga has a reputation of being very efficient and practical. One of his most prominent appearances recently was during the transition from Emperor Akihito, who abdicated, to his son Naruhito in 2019. It fell to Mr Suga to unveil the name of the new Reiwa era to the Japanese and global public. He was nicknamed ""Uncle Reiwa"" after unveiling Japan's new era name Yet, while he was the favourite to clinch the LDP leadership after Mr Abe's resignation, it is much less clear whether he will lead the party in next year's general election. Observers suggest that by then, the party dynamic could shift to put a more vibrant man at the helm who can reach a wider general electorate. Mr Suga has promised to continue with ""Abenomics"", Mr Abe's signature economic policy that was designed to stimulate the world's third biggest economy through monetary easing, fiscal spending and structural reforms. But like his predecessor he will first need to tackle the pressing demands of the coronavirus pandemic. Ahead of his election Mr Suga had pledged to expand Covid-19 testing and source vaccines for Japan by the first half of 2021. He also said he would raise the minimum wage, promote agricultural reforms and boost tourism. On foreign policy, too, he is expected to follow in Mr Abe's footsteps, prioritising Japan's long-running alliance with the US while also maintaining stable relations with China. The leadership transition comes at a difficult time for the country. Japan is still struggling with the coronavirus pandemicwhich has caused its biggest economic slump on record. Mr Abe's long-standing project of kickstarting the economy, dubbed Abenomics was, even before the pandemic hit, still a work in progress and the country has seen several years of stagnation, recession or only very slow growth. There's also unfinished business in the government's plans to reform the post-war pacifist constitution. Mr Abe wanted to change a section in the constitution to formally recognise Japan's military, which is currently called the Self Defence Force and is essentially barred from participating in any international military mandates. For all those projects, a new administration under Mr Suga could provide stability. Japan has been hit by the pandemic and an economic slump But during his time as chief cabinet secretary, he was ""remarkably lacking in vision"", Prof Nakano cautions. ""The only slogan he came up with is ""Self help, mutual help, and public help"" - emphasising neoliberal self-help and self-responsibility at the time of [a] pandemic that is exposing a whole lot of people to economic vulnerability."" New general elections for the Diet, the lower house, are scheduled for September 2021 and by then, there will likely be another leadership contest within the LDP. That contest will be more about who can win over the general electorate - rather than merely promise continuity, observers say. Mr Abe said he did not want his illness to get in the way of decision making, and apologised to the Japanese people for failing to complete his term in office. Defining Shinzo Abe and his legacy The hawk who gave his name to 'Abenomics' The 65-year-old has suffered for many years from ulcerative colitis, an inflammatory bowel disease, but he said his condition had worsened recently. Last year, he became Japan's longest serving prime minister. His current period in office began in 2012. He abruptly resigned from a previous term as prime minister in 2007 also because of his chronic condition.

"A big chunk of ice has broken away from the Arctic's largest remaining ice shelf - 79N, or Nioghalvfjerdsfjorden - in north-east Greenland. The ejected section covers about 110 square km; satellite imagery shows it to have shattered into many small pieces. The loss is further evidence say scientists of the rapid climate changes taking place in Greenland. ""The atmosphere in this region has warmed by about 3C since 1980,"" said Dr Jenny Turton. ""And in 2019 and 2020, it saw record summer temperatures,"" the polar researcher at Friedrich-Alexander University in Germany told BBC News. Nioghalvfjerdsfjorden is roughly 80km long by 20km wide and is the floating front end of the Northeast Greenland Ice Stream - where it flows off the land into the ocean to become buoyant. At its leading edge, the 79N glacier splits in two, with a minor offshoot turning directly north. It's this offshoot, or tributary, called Spalte Glacier, that has now disintegrated. 'Unprecedented' ice loss as Greenland breaks record Milne Ice Shelf: Satellites capture Arctic ice split Satellites record history of Antarctic melting The ice is being attacked from above and below The ice feature was already heavily fractured in 2019; this summer's warmth has been its final undoing. Spalte Glacier has become a flotilla of icebergs. Look closely at the satellite pictures and the higher air temperatures recorded in the region are obvious from the large number of melt ponds that sit on top of the shelf ice. The presence of such liquid water is often problematic for ice platforms. If it fills crevasses, it can help to open them up. The water will push down on the fissures, driving them through to the base of the shelf in a process known as hydrofracturing. This will weaken an ice shelf. Oceanographers have also documented warmer sea temperatures which mean the shelf ice is almost certainly being melted from beneath as well. ""79N became 'the largest remaining Arctic ice shelf' only fairly recently, after the Petermann Glacier in northwest Greenland lost a lot of area in 2010 and 2012,"" explained Prof Jason Box from the Geological Survey of Denmark and Greenland (GEUS). ""What makes 79N so important is the way it's attached to the interior ice sheet, and that means that one day - if the climate warms as we expect - this region will probably become one of the major centres of action for the deglaciation of Greenland."" Greenland and Antarctica ice loss accelerating Greenland Ice Sheet: 'More than 50 hidden lakes' detected Climate change: Greenland's ice faces melting 'death The trunk of N79 is covered in melt ponds and streams The Northeast Greenland Ice Stream drains about 15% of the interior ice sheet. The stream funnels its ice either down N79 or the glacial member just to the south, Zachariae Isstrom. Zachariae has already lost most of its floating ice shelf area. Prof Box said N79 could resist longer because it was penned in right at its forward end by some islands. This lends a degree of stability. But, he added, the shelf continues to thin, albeit mostly further back along the trunk. ""This will likely lead to N79 disintegrating from the middle, which is kind of unique. I guess, though, that won't happen for another 10 or 20 years. Who knows?"" he told BBC News. July witnessed another large ice shelf structure in the Arctic lose significant area. This was Milne Ice Shelf on the northern margin of Canada's Ellesmere Island. Eighty sq km broke free from Milne, leaving a still secure segment just 106 sq km in size. Milne was the largest intact remnant from a wider shelf feature that covered 8,600 sq km at the start of the 20th Century. The fast pace of melting in Greenland was underlined in a study last month that analysed data from the US-German Grace-FO satellites. These spacecraft are able to track changes in ice mass by sensing shifts in the pull of local gravity. They essentially weigh the ice sheet. The Grace mission found 2019 to have been a record-breaking year, with the ice sheet shedding some 530 billion tonnes. That's enough meltwater running off the land into the ocean to raise global sea-levels by 1.5mm.

"Microsoft has said that its offer to buy the US operations of hugely popular video-sharing app TikTok has been rejected, paving the way for Oracle to secure a last-minute deal. US President Donald Trump gave a 15 September deadline for the Chinese-owned app to sell or shut down. The Trump administration claims TikTok and other Chinese apps are national security threats. Microsoft and Oracle led the race to buy TikTok from Chinese firm ByteDance. TikTok is a hugely popular video sharing app - which has been downloaded 2 billion times globally - where people make and upload 15 second clips. The Wall Street Journal,externalandReuters,externalreported that Oracle, which sells database technology and cloud systems to businesses, had won the bidding war, citing people familiar with the matter. Earlier reports said Oracle was seriously considering buying TikTok's businesses in the US, Canada, Australia and New Zealand with investment firms, including General Atlantic and Sequoia Capital. A TikTok spokesperson told the BBC the firm was ""not commenting on either the Microsoft development nor the Oracle speculation"". China takes aim at US 'bullying' of its tech firms Trump gives nod to Oracle buyout of TikTok in US No deadline extension for TikTok sale - Trump On Sunday Microsoft announced that âByteDance let us know today they would not be selling TikTokâs US operations to Microsoft. We are confident our proposal would have been good for TikTokâs users, while protecting national security interests.â âWe look forward to seeing how the service evolves in these important areas,â its statement added. This paves the way for Oracle, who Mr Trump said would be ""a great company"" to take over TikTok's US operations last month. Oracle's chairman Larry Ellison is a supporter of Mr Trump and held a fundraising event for him in February. This video can not be played Why is TikTok so popular among teens? Earlier this month Mr Trump said the government should get a ""substantial portion"" of the sale price of TikTok's US unit if an American firm buys it. However, there is some confusion over the deadline. Mr Trump's executive order gave a deadline of 20 September. But the US President has repeatedly said the deadline is 15 September. Mr Trump ordered TikTok's owner ByteDance to sell its US business within 90 days or face being shut down.The forced sale of TikTok's US business is part of a wider crackdown on Chinese technology firms in America. Mr Trump has said apps such as TikTok, WeChat and equipment maker Huawei pose a national security threat because data collected about users can be shared with the Chinese government. The Chinese firms deny this claim. Huawei also faces a ban on 15 September that affects its non-American suppliers. They will have to stop shipping to Huawei if their products contain US technology. To be able to supply Huawei they will need a licence from the US Commerce Department. Two weeks ago, China announced new government restrictions on tech exports. The rules are believed to be aimed at delaying the TikTok sale. The restrictions mean some technologies such as AI, will need government approval before they can be exported. TikTok has become so popular because it has highly-advanced algorithms that predict what users want to watch. This sort of technology will now be under the spotlight from the Chinese government. These highly-valued algorithms will not be sold or transferred according to a report in the South China Morning Post. TikTok is now the second example of a high profile Chinese company that has become caught up in the US China tech cold war. Huawei was first - getting embroiled in a battle that has now effectively seen it crippled from doing any business in the US or buying any parts that have US components in them. The Trump administration says this is about levelling the playing field and national security - protecting Americans' data and privacy. But Beijing says this is the US being a bully - dissatisfied with its lack of progress in key technology areas, it is worried about losing ground, and that's why it has either tried to block Chinese tech or acquire it - in the case of TikTok. It's still not clear though what form TikTok will have if indeed it ends up in American hands - and how popular it will remain with American users. All of this of course could slow down the firm's growth in the US, but it's beginning to hint that it has already turned its focus elsewhere from the markets it's being pushed out of - the US and India - and investing in South East Asian markets instead. It's unclear what will happen to the popular video-sharing app which has around 100m active users in the US. Neither Microsoft or Oracle are seen as the most obvious suitors for TikTok, which has a predominantly young audience who share short-form lip-synching videos. Any deal will still need approval from a number of interested parties including the US and Chinese governments, ByteDance and investors. In August, TikTok filed a lawsuit against the US government in response to Mr Trump's executive order to ban the app. Why does Oracle's billionaire founder want TikTok?

"From today, face masks have to be worn in shops in Wales by everyone aged 11 and over No more than six people from extended households can meet indoors at any one time, not counting children aged 10 and under However, an intensive care doctor warns the new rules and lockdowns may have come too late to prevent a second wave of the pandemic Groups of children being told to self-isolate due to school Covid cases is to be expected, says Education Minister Kirsty Williams The details of more than 18,000 people who tested positive for coronavirus were published online by mistake, Public Health Wales has revealed David Dulin and Andy Roberts That brings an end to our live page coverage of the Welsh Government's briefing on the coronavirus pandemic. Health Minister Vaughan Gething said a lockdown could be less than seven weeks away unless people changed their behaviour. He said a spike in Newport was due to a house party on bank holiday weekend. It comes on the day:  We'll keep you updated on further developments via the BBC Wales News website and social media channels. The details of more than 18,000 people who tested positive for coronavirus werepublished online by mistakeby Public Health Wales, it has revealed. The health body said the data of 18,105 Welsh residents was viewable online for 20 hours on 30 August. Most cases gave initials, date of birth, geographical area and sex, meaning the risk of identification was low, Public Health Wales (PHW) said. However 1,928 people in living in communal settings were more at risk. Anyone with concerns can contact Public Health Wales for help There were 47 new cases in Caerphilly county borough which is under lockdown and 42 in Rhondda Cynon Taf. Newport was next with 14 new cases, then Cardiff with 12. Merthyr Tydfil - highlighted recently as another possible hotspot - had another six confirmed cases. There have beena further 183 cases of coronavirus confirmed in Wales, Public Health Wales has said. However, for the 13th day in a row, no new deaths have been reported. This video can not be played Coronavirus: Fears for extra needs pupils entering jobs market The head of the UK's biggest special education school has said he fears Covid-19 will make it even more difficult for his pupils to find jobs. Chris Britten, at Ysgol y Deri in Penarth, Vale of Glamorgan, said people with additional learning needs faced an even greater struggle for meaningful work. Employers, he said, would likely be ""swamped"" with applicants. The school of 200 pupils aged between three and 19 is featured in a new documentary series. A Special Schoolcan be seen tonight at 20:30 BST on BBC One Wales, with all three episodes available on the BBC iPlayer after the first programme has aired. Keeping out of lockdown ""depends on the choices that each one of us is prepared to make"", Health Minister Vaughan Gething said. He told Monday's Welsh Government press conference that while cases were kept low during the summer, the autumn poses a challenge. ""The challenge comes back to how we've chosen to behave through the summer and going into the autumn,"" he said. ""We suppressed coronavirus pretty significantly through the summer, we were in a position with low levels of transmission to have further easements. ""The challenge is that we've seen some people relaxing too much perhaps and small instances where people know that they're breaking the rules, and in particular larger social gatherings in people's homes, and a couple of businesses that have not enforced the rules in terms of where their customers behave. ""Now that's a challenge for us and we see as I said in Caerphilly the infection rate has moved so more people over 40 and over 50 are testing positive. ""Their risks of harm are much greater than fit and healthy people in their teens and twenties so the risks are there. ""And of course it's about what our health and social care system prepares for what might come through the autumn, and the winter, and that's entirely the right thing to do our ability to keep out of lockdown depends on the choices that each one of us is prepared to make to help keep us safe."" Sarah DickinsBBC Wales Economics Correspondent For 40 years, June Phillips has been growing plants with her brother Steve and selling them at Abergavenny market in Monmouthshire. They have loyal customers, she says, made up of country people who come into town and valleys people from as far as Merthyr Tydfil. When Covid-19 closed the market they delivered to about 100 of their customers. The market has been open again for a month but she says shoppers aren't spending like they did before lockdown. ""They are buying but it's a lot quieter and people are still very nervous about coming out,"" she said. ""We are still delivering to about 50 people who are not confident that it is all over so it's going to take a long time to get back to normal."" Read moreabout how Abergavenny is surviving the pandemic. Chris DeardenBBC Wales News There is ""real concern"" aboutplans to reduce Covid-19 testing from weekly to fortnightly at care homes in north Wales, social services bosses have warned. In an email sent on behalf of managers in several counties, officials said the move was ""premature"", given that Wales could be ""heading towards a second wave"". Conservative Member of the Senedd Darren Millar condemned the proposal while Plaid Cymru said weekly tests must continue. The Welsh Government said it was taking steps to boost testing resources. Wales' health minister says there will be a network of field hospitals in place for coronavirus. A Â£33m facility is being built at the University Hospital of Wales in Cardiff asthe Dragonâs Heart hospital at the Principality Stadium is being decommissioned. Vaughan Gething said there would be field hospitals in each health board area with more detail on the arrangements to follow. He said whether or not the hospitals will be needed âdepends on the behaviour of the publicâ. Health Minister Vaughan Gething said Wales was in a ""much better position now"" than when the nation initially went into lockdown in March. While warning that the coronoavirus situation in Wales is currently similar to where it was in February, he said: ""We've signifcantly restocked our provision of PPE [personal protective equipment], we have a range of orders still to come but we're in a much better position now than previously. ""But even with that additional assurance, it's still the case that we don't want our health and social care staff using even more significant amounts of PPE, because we want to avoid more cases of covid coming into our health and care system. ""Even with that better provision and the assurance the public should take from that, it should not lead to risk-taking behaviour and avoiding or ignoring the rules."" Wales could have to lockdown in less than seven weeks' time if there is no change in behaviour, the health minister has warned. âIf we see cases continue to riseâ¦ then we may be in a position to make that decision and need to make that decision sooner than the seven-week period of time,"" Vaughan Gething said. âIt does, I think, say to the public there is a limited period of weeks for us to reconsider the choices we're making, and to behave in a different way, if we are to avoid more local lockdowns or a national lockdown.â He added: âYou want to engage with people to persuade people but ultimately if people want to break the rules, then theyâll find there are consequences that come from that.â The Welsh Government would impose other restrictions and closures before shutting schools if coronavirus worsens, Health Minister Vaughan Gething warned. Earlier steps could include restricting pubsâ opening hours. He said:
âWe want to keep schools open so other closures would take place first to protect our ability to keep children in school. âBecause we know the significant harm it does to children's wellbeing in the here and now, from having schools closed, as well as the harm to their future prospects.â Wales' Health Minister Vaugahn Gething said it is up to individuals and businesses to think carefully âabout the choices we makeâ when it comes to following Covid rules. Asked whether the Welsh Government has been too reliant on people's goodwill in following the rules, Mr Gething said there was âmore concerted action by local authorities across the countryâ. He said Caerphilly had increased its enforcement, adding: âI spoke with the leader of Newport today - theyâre increasing their enforcement activity."" In Rhondda Cynon Taf, a pub was closed in the last few days because it was not following the rules while enforcement notices have been issued against supermarkets. Mr Gething added: âSo itâs really important that businesses play their part.â But he said even if a business was doing what it should, customers still had choices about their behaviour. âThat means people not going into pubs and restaurants in more mixed groups,"" he said. ""Itâs important that we stick with the rules that weâve got about limiting our contact to our extended households. ""Otherwise we may not just see a large number of cases but all the consequences in closing down a range of businesses with consequences for peopleâs livelihoods.â Wales' health minister warned the testing problem at UK level needed to be resolved before the demand for tests surged ahead of the ""pinch point"" of a potential second peak. Vaughan Gething said: ""Autumn and winter is likely to be the most demanding period of time, with more coughs colds and other challenges that mimic the symptoms of coronavirus, as well as of course the pinch point of returning to school, universities returning, so this is happening in a particularly difficult time for all of us. ""But I don't think it's going to be resolved for a number of weeks, and that follows a constructive conversation that all four health ministers had at the end of last week. ""That's why we are moving part of our capacity from NHS Wales labs to make sure that mobile testing units are run through Welsh labs, to make sure we've got enough capacity if we do see further spikes to move those units around, whilst the lighthouse lab issues are being resolved."" When asked why the Welsh NHS was not using its whole testing capacity, Health Minister Vaughan Gething said the Welsh Government wanted to move ""more resources"" to where they understand there is a spike in cases. Mr Gething added that testing from the UK-wide Lighthouse Labs ""didn't properly account"" for outbreaks in heightened areas of concern. He said if more testing capacity was moved back to NHS Wales they could ""make choices about highest priority areas"" if they knew there was not going to be enough testing capacity. When asked why testing in north Wales care homes had been moved from weekly to fortnightly, the minister said north Wales had a ""very low incidence"" of tests coming back positive. Mr Gething added that in areas of concern including Caerphilly and Rhondda Cynon Taf more regular testing has been introduced and those county boroughs, along with Newport, had taken the decision to end visiting in care homes. New restrictions on who can meet up and where have come into force today across the UK. All four nations are following a ""rule of six"" on the maximum number which can meet indoors, but there are variations on the numbers for outdoor gatherings. In Wales, up to 30 people can still meet outdoors, but in England the number has been cut to six. Wales' health minister said there has been a change in the pattern of coronavirus infection in Caerphilly county borough. Vaughan Gething said more people in the 40s and 50s age brackets were testing positive, while there have been cases in care homes and people being admitted to hospital. But the situation in Merthyr Tydfil was ""more complex"". He added: ""There is a cluster of cases linked to people working in a company; we are also seeing cases linked to Caerphilly borough, as well as those associated with socialising and holiday travel."" On Rhondda Cynon Taf, he said the cases were largely centred on the lower Rhondda Valley and  linked to people socialising without social distancing and returning from holiday. ""We also have a small cluster of cases linked to a caravan park"", he added. Community coronavirus testing in the Rhondda area has been hampered by the ongoing issues with the UK governmentâs Lighthouse Lab system, according to Wales' health minister who said it ""plainly isn't acceptable"". Vaughan Gething added: ""Late on Friday night, the UK government made the unilateral decision to reduce the Lighthouse testing capacity at all mobile testing units in Wales, including in the Rhondda, to just 60. ""We intervened to increase this over the weekend. And crucially the health board, the local authority and the Welsh Ambulance Service also made extra testing capacity available to cope with the demand."" Mr Gething said there were also issues with people trying to book a test at drive-in centres but finding they were full or had to travel hundreds of miles for one. He said he had spoken to the UK government's health secretary Matt Hancock ""on several occasions over the weekend"" and they agreed immediate action ""to protect capacity in areas experiencing higher incidence and spikes and make sure restrictions are not placed on Wales again"". Mr Gething added that the Welsh Government was switching testing facilities to Welsh laboratories to increase capacity through the mobile testing units while the UK government resolves issues with the Lighthouse system. Health Minister Vaughan Gething said there has beena ""rapid rise"" in new cases in Newport, following a similar pattern to that in neighbouring Caerphilly county borough. Mr Gething added: ""At the heart of it appears to be a party over the bank holiday weekend, which led to 18 new cases of coronavirus, many of whom visited other venues on nights out while infectious. ""Public Health Wales yesterday asked people who had visited a list of bars and pubs in the city to be aware of the symptoms of coronavirus."" Coronavirus have risen sharply recently in Caerphilly county borough, Merthyr Tydfil, Rhondda Cynon Taf and Newport, according to Wales' health minister. Vaughan Gething said there were many similarities between the rises in each of the areas ""including socialising indoors and at home without social distancing, and imported cases from holiday travel"". He added the Welsh Government was looking at increasing the range of measures to tackle the outbreaks including the ""possible introduction"" of curfews, restricting alcohol sales and changing pub operations, including shorter opening hours or only selling alcohol with food.

Here are some of the key news stories so far today.  The news was brought to you by Ashitha Nagesh, Emma Harrison, Victoria Bisset and Victoria Lindrea. It was edited by Mal Siret and Owen Amos. About 3,000 undertakers in South Africa have gone on strike over pay and working conditions. As part of the strike they're refusing to collect bodies from people's homes and hospitals, and are also not holding burials. Their union wants the government to set up a coronavirus relief fund for the industry. Undertakers have struggled with the increasing cost of burials during the pandemic, because of the need for personal protective equipment (PPE), sanitiser and other extra protective items. But officials say they're worried the strike will cause a significant risk to public health. Macy's department store is making its famous Thanksgiving Day Parade a television-only special presentation, with no in-person spectators, the company said in a joint statement with the City of New York. Instead of going around the traditional 2.5-mile route, this year the parade will be staged solely around the Herald Square area of Midtown Manhattan. The first parade was staged in 1924, and has been a major fixture on the US festive calendar ever since. In recent years, more than 3.5m people have lined the streets each year to watch the parade in person. Faced with a surging coronavirus outbreak and poor working conditions, medical staff from across Morocco have been staging protests over the past few weeks. The country reported a record 2,430 cases last Friday, and has seen more than 1,000 new cases every day since July. Meanwhile, medical unions say some intensive care units are overrun and other wards are full. Morocco's Health Ministry has tried to raise capacity by setting up field hospitals - tents with beds and oxygen - but some medics say the main problem is staff shortages, particularly in rural areas. Anas Qarim, a nurse working at a Covid-19 hospital in Meknes, told Reuters news agency that they had just three nurses and two doctors to treat 120 patients. ""Imagine wearing full protective gear in the summer heat working continuously for hours,"" he said. There could be a second national lockdown in Wales if people fail ""to reconsider the choices we're making"", the health minister has warned. Vaughan Gething warned the pattern of increasing cases was ""similar to the situation we faced in early February"" - and that national lockdown remained an option. The number of new coronavirus cases in Wales increased by 183 on Monday - the largest rise in daily cases since 19 May, bringing the total number of confirmed cases in the country to 19,573. It comes as the government in Wales introduces mandatory face masks in all indoor public spaces and restricts more than six people from an extended household from meeting inside. ""If there isn't a change in behaviour, we could well be not just seven weeks away from a national lockdown, it could potentially be much quicker,"" Mr Gething said. Sameer HashmiMiddle East Business Correspondent, BBC News Volunteers for the phase three trial have come from countries including Egypt The United Arab Emirates government has approved
the use of a Covid-19 vaccine for frontline healthcare workers following
successful clinical trials. The countryâs health minister said the vaccine could be utilised in ""cases of emergency"" involving the
country's healthcare staff. He said the decision came after the phase three trial showed no adverse effects and that the vaccine was able to create antibodies. He added that 31,000 volunteers, representing 125 nationalities, had participated in the clinical trials. China-based Sinopharm CNG has developed
the vaccine and has been conducting the phase three clinical trial along with the
Abu Dhabi government and UAE-based artificial intelligence firm, G42
Healthcare. A secondary school in the UK has been closed and an entire year group asked to self-isolate, due to one confirmed case of coronavirus. In aletter to parents,external, Stantonbury International School, in Milton Keynes, said all of Year Eight had been ""in close contact"" with the person. It said those pupils and ""a number of teachers"" would have to self-isolate for 14 days. The state-funded academy has about 1,600 pupils; all pupils, except Year Eight, were expected to return by Wednesday. Head teacher Alison Ramsay thanked parents for their ""understanding at this difficult time"".  As we told you earlier, there were a further 2,621 confirmed cases of coronavirus in the UK today - after three consecutive days with more than 3,000 positive tests. It means the seven-day average for daily infections now stands at 3,004. The marked rise in infections over the past week is in keeping with many other countries in Europe, notably Spain and France. Nine more deaths - within 28 days of a positive test - were reported by the UK government on Monday. Deaths remain low - compared to figures at the height of the lockdown in April and May - despite the current spike in infections. On average, there were 12 deaths a day over the past seven days. Six the Musical will be at the Lyric theatre in London from 14 November Everybody's Talking About Jamie and Six will become the first musicals back in London's West End in mid-November, eight months after the curtain came down. They will hit the stage three weeks after a string of non-musical shows reopen London's theatre district. The Play That Goes Wrong, Agatha Christie's The Mousetrap and Adam Kay's This Is Going To Hurt will all admit socially distant audiences in October. Venue bosses said ""robust risk mitigation"" would be in place including reduced capacities, contactless tickets, temperature tests and deep cleans, as well as hand sanitation, face coverings and track and trace.

But where else have cases been surging? Which countries are experiencing a second wave? And what about the US, which remains the country with both the highest number of cases and deaths? In the US, overall, the daily number of new cases is continuing to fall: Some European countries are experiencing second surges of cases of the virus, after getting their outbreaks under control over the summer: A number of countries outside Europe have experienced second surges, too. In Israel, the government is imposing a second national lockdown from Friday in an attempt to control the outbreak: And in some countries, cases have been rising steadily for months: Kat Kingsley said she would be wary of giving her details out again A woman said she was sent ""creepy"" messages by a city bus tour worker who got her details from her test-and-trace form. Kat Kingsley, 25, from Hayle in Cornwall, went on the Original Tour bus in Windsor on Thursday. On Sunday she received two messages from a member of staff at the company saying he wanted to see her. Original Tour said it had launched an investigation as it ""takes the matter extremely seriously"". Read more here Officials in Marseille say the city is facing a spike in coronavirus cases, and that hospitals are close to running out of space to treat people with the virus. All but four of Marseille's intensive care beds are in use, they say, and plans have been made to reallocate resources from other areas to deal with the increase in patients. The authorities have also imposed a number of new restrictions - including making it mandatory to wear masks outdoors in the worst-hit areas, and banning groups of more than 10 from meeting in beaches and parks. Cases have been surging across France. This weekend, the country reporteda single-day increase of more than 10,000 new coronavirus cases. Labour has accused the government of trying to ""exempt the bloodsport passions of their big donors"" from new coronavirus restrictions, after it emerged thatso-called 'rule of six' limitswould not apply to hunting. Government guidelines exempt activities shooting and paintball, as part of a wider exemption for sport that can be done with more than five others. Other activities which are excluded from the ""rule of six"" regulations include team sports such as football, hockey and netball. But shadow environment secretary Luke Pollard said: ""Across the country, people are struggling to get Covid-19 tests anywhere near their homes. ""But the Conservatives are distracted with trying to exempt the bloodsport passions of their big donors from coronavirus regulations. ""It shows where this Government's priorities really lie."" As we reported earlier, the World Health Organization (WHO) has said there has been a record single-day rise in the number of new coronavirus cases. According to the WHO, 307,930 new cases were reported over the past 24 hours. The biggest increases were in India, the US and Brazil. We've put together this chart showing where in the world cases are surging - and falling. Fewer than half of all coronavirus fines handed out in England and Wales since the end of March have been paid so far. Of the 19,171 fines handed out by police for breaching coronavirus restrictions, just 8,930 were paid. Figures published in the letter to the Justice Committee revealed 8,954 fixed penalty notices - 8,325 in England and 629 in Wales - have not been paid within the 28-day payment period, meaning prosecution may follow. Another 1,287 unpaid fines are still pending. Police were given powers to fine people for breaching coronavirus restrictions from 27 March, following the lockdown on 23 March. There have been 2,621 new cases of coronavirus recorded across the UK. It marks a fall of more than 600 cases on Sunday's figures, when 3,330 positive cases were recorded. However weekend figures are often lower, due to delays in reporting. A further nine deaths have been recorded since 09:00 on Sunday, bringing the total reported death toll across the UK to 41,628. A death is anyone who dies within 28 days of testing positive for Covid-19. This video can not be played How not to wear a face mask Does it matter if you wear your face mask wrong? Well, yes. Wearing a face mask or covering incorrectly can make it easier for coronavirus to spread. From today it is compulsory to wear face coverings in shops and indoor places in Wales for everyone aged 11 and over. Face coverings must also be worn in shops, supermarkets and shopping centres in England, Scotland and Northern Ireland. Read

Israel ""do not expect a problem"" fulfilling their European Championship play-off against Scotland despite a national lockdown being put in place. Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahuannounced new restrictions from Fridayfor at least three weeks. Scotland are due to host Israel at Hampden Park on 8 October.

Read more here The details of more than 18,000 people who tested positive for coronavirus were published online by mistake by Public Health Wales. The health body said the data of 18,105 Welsh residents was online for 20 hours on 30 August and it was viewed 56 times before it was removed. Most cases gave initials, date of birth, geographical area and sex, meaning the risk of identification was low, Public Health Wales said. However 1,928 people in living in communal settings were more at risk as nursing home residents or those living in supported housing also had the name of their place of residence published. The incident was the result of ""individual human error"" when the information was uploaded to a public server searchable by anyone using the site. Read

The number of new coronavirus cases in Wales increased by 183 on Monday - the largest rise in daily cases since 19 May, bringing the total number of confirmed cases in the country to 19,573. It comes as the government in Wales introduces mandatory face masks in all indoor public spaces and restricts more than six people from an extended household from meeting inside. ""If there isn't a change in behaviour, we could well be not just seven weeks away from a national lockdown, it could potentially be much quicker,"" Mr Gething said. Sameer HashmiMiddle East Business Correspondent, BBC News Volunteers for the phase three trial have come from countries including Egypt The United Arab Emirates government has approved
the use of a Covid-19 vaccine for frontline healthcare workers following
successful clinical trials. The countryâs health minister said the vaccine could be utilised in ""cases of emergency"" involving the
country's healthcare staff. He said the decision came after the phase three trial showed no adverse effects and that the vaccine was able to create antibodies. He added that 31,000 volunteers, representing 125 nationalities, had participated in the clinical trials. China-based Sinopharm CNG has developed
the vaccine and has been conducting the phase three clinical trial along with the
Abu Dhabi government and UAE-based artificial intelligence firm, G42
Healthcare. A secondary school in the UK has been closed and an entire year group asked to self-isolate, due to one confirmed case of coronavirus. In aletter to parents,external, Stantonbury International School, in Milton Keynes, said all of Year Eight had been ""in close contact"" with the person. It said those pupils and ""a number of teachers"" would have to self-isolate for 14 days. The state-funded academy has about 1,600 pupils; all pupils, except Year Eight, were expected to return by Wednesday. Head teacher Alison Ramsay thanked parents for their ""understanding at this difficult time"".  As we told you earlier, there were a further 2,621 confirmed cases of coronavirus in the UK today - after three consecutive days with more than 3,000 positive tests. It means the seven-day average for daily infections now stands at 3,004. The marked rise in infections over the past week is in keeping with many other countries in Europe, notably Spain and France. Nine more deaths - within 28 days of a positive test - were reported by the UK government on Monday. Deaths remain low - compared to figures at the height of the lockdown in April and May - despite the current spike in infections. On average, there were 12 deaths a day over the past seven days. Six the Musical will be at the Lyric theatre in London from 14 November Everybody's Talking About Jamie and Six will become the first musicals back in London's West End in mid-November, eight months after the curtain came down. They will hit the stage three weeks after a string of non-musical shows reopen London's theatre district. The Play That Goes Wrong, Agatha Christie's The Mousetrap and Adam Kay's This Is Going To Hurt will all admit socially distant audiences in October. Venue bosses said ""robust risk mitigation"" would be in place including reduced capacities, contactless tickets, temperature tests and deep cleans, as well as hand sanitation, face coverings and track and trace.

But where else have cases been surging? Which countries are experiencing a second wave? And what about the US, which remains the country with both the highest number of cases and deaths? In the US, overall, the daily number of new cases is continuing to fall: Some European countries are experiencing second surges of cases of the virus, after getting their outbreaks under control over the summer: A number of countries outside Europe have experienced second surges, too. In Israel, the government is imposing a second national lockdown from Friday in an attempt to control the outbreak: And in some countries, cases have been rising steadily for months: Kat Kingsley said she would be wary of giving her details out again A woman said she was sent ""creepy"" messages by a city bus tour worker who got her details from her test-and-trace form. Kat Kingsley, 25, from Hayle in Cornwall, went on the Original Tour bus in Windsor on Thursday. On Sunday she received two messages from a member of staff at the company saying he wanted to see her. Original Tour said it had launched an investigation as it ""takes the matter extremely seriously"". Read more here Officials in Marseille say the city is facing a spike in coronavirus cases, and that hospitals are close to running out of space to treat people with the virus. All but four of Marseille's intensive care beds are in use, they say, and plans have been made to reallocate resources from other areas to deal with the increase in patients. The authorities have also imposed a number of new restrictions - including making it mandatory to wear masks outdoors in the worst-hit areas, and banning groups of more than 10 from meeting in beaches and parks. Cases have been surging across France. This weekend, the country reporteda single-day increase of more than 10,000 new coronavirus cases. Labour has accused the government of trying to ""exempt the bloodsport passions of their big donors"" from new coronavirus restrictions, after it emerged thatso-called 'rule of six' limitswould not apply to hunting. Government guidelines exempt activities shooting and paintball, as part of a wider exemption for sport that can be done with more than five others. Other activities which are excluded from the ""rule of six"" regulations include team sports such as football, hockey and netball. But shadow environment secretary Luke Pollard said: ""Across the country, people are struggling to get Covid-19 tests anywhere near their homes. ""But the Conservatives are distracted with trying to exempt the bloodsport passions of their big donors from coronavirus regulations. ""It shows where this Government's priorities really lie."" As we reported earlier, the World Health Organization (WHO) has said there has been a record single-day rise in the number of new coronavirus cases. According to the WHO, 307,930 new cases were reported over the past 24 hours. The biggest increases were in India, the US and Brazil. We've put together this chart showing where in the world cases are surging - and falling. Fewer than half of all coronavirus fines handed out in England and Wales since the end of March have been paid so far. Of the 19,171 fines handed out by police for breaching coronavirus restrictions, just 8,930 were paid. Figures published in the letter to the Justice Committee revealed 8,954 fixed penalty notices - 8,325 in England and 629 in Wales - have not been paid within the 28-day payment period, meaning prosecution may follow. Another 1,287 unpaid fines are still pending. Police were given powers to fine people for breaching coronavirus restrictions from 27 March, following the lockdown on 23 March. There have been 2,621 new cases of coronavirus recorded across the UK. It marks a fall of more than 600 cases on Sunday's figures, when 3,330 positive cases were recorded. However weekend figures are often lower, due to delays in reporting. A further nine deaths have been recorded since 09:00 on Sunday, bringing the total reported death toll across the UK to 41,628. A death is anyone who dies within 28 days of testing positive for Covid-19. This video can not be played How not to wear a face mask Does it matter if you wear your face mask wrong? Well, yes. Wearing a face mask or covering incorrectly can make it easier for coronavirus to spread. From today it is compulsory to wear face coverings in shops and indoor places in Wales for everyone aged 11 and over. Face coverings must also be worn in shops, supermarkets and shopping centres in England, Scotland and Northern Ireland. Read

The health body said the data of 18,105 Welsh residents was online for 20 hours on 30 August and it was viewed 56 times before it was removed. Most cases gave initials, date of birth, geographical area and sex, meaning the risk of identification was low, Public Health Wales said. However 1,928 people in living in communal settings were more at risk as nursing home residents or those living in supported housing also had the name of their place of residence published. The incident was the result of ""individual human error"" when the information was uploaded to a public server searchable by anyone using the site. Read

school for millions of Italian children today. I grew up learning the three Rs, but today Italian children have to know the three Ms: Mascherina, Mani, Metro (mask,
hands, metre). There was the usual mix of first-day excitement and nerves. Ten-year-old
Gabriele posed joyfully for a photo with his classmates in masks. His mother,
an A&E doctor, was impressed to see them greeting each other with elbow
bumps â not the usual bear hugs. ""The parents were far less disciplined,"" she
remarked. My seven-year-old is relieved to return to proper lessons
with teachers, instead of ""full-time homework"". But she is sad that coronavirus
means ""it's never going to be the same"". She's worried about playtime - ""what
happens when it rains?"" - and nervous about all the new rules. So are the
parents. Which entrance will they use? What if you have two kids at
the school? Borrowing in class is banned and everything has to be name-labelled.
Each individual pencil?! Masks can only be removed once children are seated at their
desks. At our school, washable masks aren't allowed: they must be surgical,
changed daily, and for now provided by the parents. Disappointingly, our class sizes haven't been reduced or
classrooms extended. Pigeon holes have simply been removed to make room to
space out the desks. Despite our worries, my daughter is looking on the bright side: ""At least nobody can nick my pencil sharpener."" Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking.",Positive,1.0
"Illustration of antibodies attacking the coronavirus A new antibody treatment is to be trialled on Covid-19 patients in UK hospitals. Monoclonal antibodies, which are potent, laboratory-made antibodies, will be given to about 2,000 people to see if they are effective against coronavirus. It forms part of the UK Recovery Trial, which found that a cheap steroid called dexamethasone could save lives. The first patients will be given the new drugs in the coming weeks. Prof Martin Landray from the University of Oxford, who is co-leading the Recovery Trial, said: âThis is the first type of treatment that's targeted for this specific virus. âThere are lots of good reasons for thinking it might well be effective - stopping the virus from reproducing, stopping the virus from causing damage, improving survival for patients. âWe need to know, and the way to know is to do the trials that will tell us whether that hope turns into reality.â Antibodies could be described as the ""warriors"" of the immune system. When coronavirus infects your body, antibodies attach to the spikes of the virus, blocking it from entering your cells. But we produce many different types of antibodies - the most potent are called neutralising antibodies. So scientists ""sieve"" through them to find the one thatâs best at sticking to the spike. The chosen antibody is multiplied in the lab, and produced in huge quantities. This is then given to patients, immediately boosting their immune response. This video can not be played The BBC's Rebecca Morelle explains how the monoclonal antibodies work The trial will test a mixture of two monoclonal antibodies made by the US biotech company Regeneron. Both attach to the spike of the virus at slightly different places. So if the virus mutates, and the structure changes, at least one should still work. Regeneron has already produced monoclonal antibodies that can treat Ebola. Leah Lipsich, vice president of the company, said: ""We're hoping that we can springboard from that very effective result against Ebola to something that's just as effective with Covid-19."" The UK Recovery Trial,externalwas set up at the start of the pandemic to identify treatments that could help people admitted to hospital with Covid-19. It has already showed the steroid dexamethasone cuts the risk of death by a third for patients on ventilators, and by a fifth for those on oxygen. Patients will start being given monoclonal antibodies in the next few weeks, and the results will be compared with other patients who have not been given the antibodies. Prof Landray expects that about 2,000 people in each group will be needed to answer key questions. He said: âWe need to understand not only if these treatments work. We also need to understand in whom do they work, and in whom do they work best. âDo they work in people who are older or younger? Do they work in people with more severe or milder disease? Do they work in people only when they're on ventilators or, possibly more likely, before they ever need ventilators?â The results will also be compared with people receiving convalescent plasma, another treatment currently undergoing trials by the Recovery team. This is where plasma, the yellowish, liquid part of blood, is taken from people whoâve recovered from coronavirus and given to patients. The Recovery Trial is also looking at azithromycin, a commonly used antibiotic, and tocilizumab, an anti-inflammatory treatment. Monoclonal antibodies have been used clinically since the 1980s, and are used to treat many diseases including some forms of cancer. But because they are a relatively new technology, they can be expensive. The price for the Covid treatment has not yet been set. But Prof Landray says if it works, fair access to all patients, internationally, is an issue that needs to be considered. Some vaccines are entering the final phase of trials, but none are near being ready to roll out. And with Covid cases rising, people are still being hospitalised and some are dying. Apart from dexamethasone and another cheap steroid, hydrocortisone, there are no other clinically proven treatments for Covid-19, so finding new ways to help patients is vital. But even once we do have a vaccine, treatments will continue to play a role. Leah Lipsich, from Regeneron, said: âThere will be populations - the immunocompromised, the elderly - who may not mount a sufficient immune response to a vaccine and will require treatment. âAnd we feel very strongly that these highly potent neutralising antibodies really will help boost the immune response, and will always be needed even even when a vaccine is available.â Follow Rebecca on Twitter,external What is dexamethasone and how does it fight Covid-19?

"The small town of Leighton Buzzard has experienced two earthquakes within a week Leighton Buzzard residents have felt a second earthquake within a week. The British Geological Survey (BGS) said a 2.1-magnitude tremor was felt in the Bedfordshire town at 00:20 BST on Monday. It comes after a 3.5-magnitude earthquake hit the town on Tuesday. The BGS tweeted there had been ""a small number of reports"" from the public with one saying this earthquake ""felt slower and less intense"". One Twitter user said: ""What is going on??? Just woken by another earthquake in Leighton Buzzard!"" Leighton Linslade Town Council mayor Dave Bowater said he slept through the second quake, but the first had been ""a little bit frightening"". ""We've had two now and the experts say that is one and the aftershock,"" he said. ""We should be done now."" Mr Bowater, who once spent 10 days living on the 14th floor of a hotel in Tokyo while a number of four and above-magnitude earthquakes took place, said he was surprised to experience two in Leighton Buzzard. ""It brings things sharply into focus when you can be hit that strongly out of the blue,"" he said. The first earthquakestruck just north of Leighton Buzzardand was also felt in Dunstable, Bedfordshire, and Milton Keynes and Aylesbury in Buckinghamshire.

"The Chain Home Tower at Great Baddow, Essex has been Grade II listed on the advice of Historic England A radar tower that helped win World War Two's Battle of Britain by providing early warning of Luftwaffe attacks has been given protected status. The Chain Home Tower at Great Baddow in Essex has been Grade II listed by the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS). It is the only complete tower of its kind surviving in the British Isles. Tony Calladine from Historic England said it was ""a testament to the men and women who developed the technology"". It has been listed to mark the 80th anniversary of the Battle of Britain, which took place between July and October 1940. The tower, one of five complete Chain Home masts still standing, was originally erected at RAF Canewdon in south-east Essex in 1937 and relocated to Great Baddow in 1956. The tower, a prominent Essex landmark, was moved to the Marconi Company research site at Great Baddow Chain Home was the first early warning radar network in the world and the first military radar system to be fully operational. As well as detecting enemy planes, the technology was vital to the defence of London, through the tracking of destructive V1 flying bombs and V2 missiles later in World War Two. British Library architect's school design listed 18th Century lighthouse reduced to rubble 'Show must go on' at listed pier's theatre When the tower, which is 109m (358ft) high, was relocated in 1956 it was used in defence research and communications during the Cold War. It was particularly crucial in the development of the radio guidance system forthe British ""Blue Streak"" intercontinental ballistic missile. Daniel Black, who campaigned for the tower to be listed, said: ""This tower represents not only the innovation and brilliance of pre-war engineers and scientists but also the heritage of the local area.""

"The Chain Home Tower at Great Baddow, Essex has been Grade II listed on the advice of Historic England A radar tower that helped win World War Two's Battle of Britain by providing early warning of Luftwaffe attacks has been given protected status. The Chain Home Tower at Great Baddow in Essex has been Grade II listed by the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS). It is the only complete tower of its kind surviving in the British Isles. Tony Calladine from Historic England said it was ""a testament to the men and women who developed the technology"". It has been listed to mark the 80th anniversary of the Battle of Britain, which took place between July and October 1940. The tower, one of five complete Chain Home masts still standing, was originally erected at RAF Canewdon in south-east Essex in 1937 and relocated to Great Baddow in 1956. The tower, a prominent Essex landmark, was moved to the Marconi Company research site at Great Baddow Chain Home was the first early warning radar network in the world and the first military radar system to be fully operational. As well as detecting enemy planes, the technology was vital to the defence of London, through the tracking of destructive V1 flying bombs and V2 missiles later in World War Two. British Library architect's school design listed 18th Century lighthouse reduced to rubble 'Show must go on' at listed pier's theatre When the tower, which is 109m (358ft) high, was relocated in 1956 it was used in defence research and communications during the Cold War. It was particularly crucial in the development of the radio guidance system forthe British ""Blue Streak"" intercontinental ballistic missile. Daniel Black, who campaigned for the tower to be listed, said: ""This tower represents not only the innovation and brilliance of pre-war engineers and scientists but also the heritage of the local area.""

"The humpback whale was found in Australia's East Alligator River Australian officials say they will try to guide a humpback whale out of a crocodile-infested river in the Northern Territory after it got lost and ended up 30km (18.5 miles) inland. The whale and others were on an annual sea migration when some of them ""took a wrong turn"", experts believe. Two whales were later able to swim out of the river, but at least one remains. It's the first known instance of a whale being found in crocodile territory so far inland in Australia. Given its estimated 16m (52 ft) length, the humpback is considered unlikely to be disturbed by crocodiles. But that risk could escalate if the whale were to become stranded in the shallow waters, officials said on Monday. The whales were spotted last week in the East Alligator River by people boating in the Kakadu National Park - Australia's biggest national park and a World Heritage-listed site. The sight of the animals swimming along the muddy bends of the river - so far from open water - has amazed locals. The whale swam about 30 km (18.5 miles) upstream ""It's something that's never been recorded before - not just in the Northern Territory - but [in] Australia. It's really, really unusual,"" said Carole Palmer, a marine ecosystems scientist for the territory's government. It was hard to determine if more than one whale needed assistance because of the river's ""murky brown water"", she added. Ms Palmer told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation that experts weren't sure ""why these whales took a wrong turn"" off the country's north coast. It is thought they had been heading south to Antarctica but mistakenly entered an estuary which took them further upstream into the river system. Whales migrate to warmer waters off Australia during spring to give birth before heading back to Antarctica to feed. Whale migration: Rare encounter on Great Barrier Reef Although the river teems with saltwater crocodiles, experts do not expect a confrontation. This video can not be played The East Alligator River connects to Cahills Crossing, a river bridge notorious in Kakadu for its proximity to crocodiles But if the whale becomes trapped in the shallow bends and washes up on a bank ""it's an easy feed for them,"" Ms Palmer told the ABC. ""There's no way we can lift a 12-16m humpback whale off the sandbar and that's potentially when the crocs would kick in."" To clear a path to the ocean, boats have been banned along part of the river. It had been hoped the whale would leave on its own, but it has remained around the deepest section of the river - about 20km from sea. Park rangers are trying to help the whale get out of the river system Ms Palmer said officials were considering several options to draw it out, such as using ""noisy sound"" from nearby boats or recordings of humpback whale calls. ""It's tricky on every level, but everyone is really trying to move forward with this in the most positive way that we can,"" she said. 'Super rare' whale encounter on Great Barrier Reef.

"GP practices are being told they must make sure patients can be seen face to face when they need such appointments. NHS England is writing to all practices to make sure they are communicating the fact doctors can be seen in person if necessary, as well as virtually. It's estimated half of the 102 million appointments from March to July were by video or phone call, NHS Digital said. The Royal College of GPs said any implication GPs had not been doing their job properly was ""an insult"". NHS England said research suggested nearly two thirds of the public were happy to have a phone or video call with their doctor - but that, ahead of winter, they wanted to make sure people knew they could see their GP if needed. Nikki Kanani, medical director of primary care for NHS England, said GPs had adapted quickly in recent months to offer remote consultations and ""safe face-to-face care when needed"". How GPs are changing the way they work UK faces 'balancing act' Who would get a vaccine - and how? She added: ""While many people, particularly those most vulnerable to Covid-19, want the convenience of a consultation over the phone or video, the NHS has been and will continue to offer face-to-face appointments and I would urge anyone who feels they need medical support to come forward so they can get the care, support and advice they need - the NHS is here for you."" NHS England said it would be reminding GPs they faced enforcement action if they failed to offer face-to-face appointments when necessary on medical grounds. Failure to do so was a breach of their contract, it said. Prof Martin Marshall, chair of the Royal College of GPs, said general practice was ""open and has been throughout the pandemic"", with a predominantly remote service to help stop the spread of coronavirus. This video can not be played Dr Debbie Noland wears full PPE when seeing patients and cleans the examination room between patients He said: ""The college does not want to see general practice become a totally, or even mostly, remote service post-pandemic. ""However, we are still in the middle of a pandemic. We need to consider infection control and limit footfall in GP surgeries - all in line with NHS England's current guidance."" He said most patients had understood the changes and that clinical commissioning groups had been asked to work with GP practices where face-to-face appointments were not possible - for example, if all GPs were at a high risk from coronavirus. ""Any implication that they have not been doing their job properly is an insult to GPs and their teams who have worked throughout the pandemic, continued delivering the vast majority of patient care in the NHS and face an incredibly difficult winter ahead,"" he said. Research from the college indicated that routine GP appointments were back to near-normal levels for this time of year, after decreasing at the height of the pandemic. ""Each and every day last week an estimated third of a million appointments were delivered face to face by general practices across the country,"" added Prof Marshall. TESTING:What tests are available? SYMPTOMS:What are they and how to guard against them? LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? LOCAL LOCKDOWNS:What happens if you have one? TEST AND TRACE:How does it work? It comes as thousands of doctors say a second peak is likely this winter - and is their greatest fear. The British Medical Association survey of more than 8,000 doctors and medical students found that 86% of them believed a second peak was likely, or very likely, in the next six months. The survey indicated doctors thought the two most important measures to help prevent such a peak were having a fit-for-purpose test-and-trace system and a ""coherent, rapid and consistent approach to local outbreaks"". BMA council chair Dr Chaand Nagpaul said: ""We, as a profession, want, above all, to avoid a return to the scenes we saw in April, when hospitals were full with Covid-19 patients, and hundreds were dying every day. Meanwhile, thousands of others missed out on vital appointments and procedures as routine care was put on hold. ""But while the forecast in this survey may be bleak, it is not an inevitability if the government takes decisive, robust and timely action to stamp down the spread of the infection."" He called on the government to focus on ""sorting out the test-and-trace debacle once and for all"", adding: ""We are at a critical crossroads in the fight against this deadly virus.""

About 3,000 undertakers in South Africa have gone on strike over pay and working conditions. As part of the strike they're refusing to collect bodies from people's homes and hospitals, and are also not holding burials. Their union wants the government to set up a coronavirus relief fund for the industry. Undertakers have struggled with the increasing cost of burials during the pandemic, because of the need for personal protective equipment (PPE), sanitiser and other extra protective items. But officials say they're worried the strike will cause a significant risk to public health. Macy's department store is making its famous Thanksgiving Day Parade a television-only special presentation, with no in-person spectators, the company said in a joint statement with the City of New York. Instead of going around the traditional 2.5-mile route, this year the parade will be staged solely around the Herald Square area of Midtown Manhattan. The first parade was staged in 1924, and has been a major fixture on the US festive calendar ever since. In recent years, more than 3.5m people have lined the streets each year to watch the parade in person. Faced with a surging coronavirus outbreak and poor working conditions, medical staff from across Morocco have been staging protests over the past few weeks. The country reported a record 2,430 cases last Friday, and has seen more than 1,000 new cases every day since July. Meanwhile, medical unions say some intensive care units are overrun and other wards are full. Morocco's Health Ministry has tried to raise capacity by setting up field hospitals - tents with beds and oxygen - but some medics say the main problem is staff shortages, particularly in rural areas. Anas Qarim, a nurse working at a Covid-19 hospital in Meknes, told Reuters news agency that they had just three nurses and two doctors to treat 120 patients. ""Imagine wearing full protective gear in the summer heat working continuously for hours,"" he said. There could be a second national lockdown in Wales if people fail ""to reconsider the choices we're making"", the health minister has warned. Vaughan Gething warned the pattern of increasing cases was ""similar to the situation we faced in early February"" - and that national lockdown remained an option. The number of new coronavirus cases in Wales increased by 183 on Monday - the largest rise in daily cases since 19 May, bringing the total number of confirmed cases in the country to 19,573. It comes as the government in Wales introduces mandatory face masks in all indoor public spaces and restricts more than six people from an extended household from meeting inside. ""If there isn't a change in behaviour, we could well be not just seven weeks away from a national lockdown, it could potentially be much quicker,"" Mr Gething said. Sameer HashmiMiddle East Business Correspondent, BBC News Volunteers for the phase three trial have come from countries including Egypt The United Arab Emirates government has approved
the use of a Covid-19 vaccine for frontline healthcare workers following
successful clinical trials. The countryâs health minister said the vaccine could be utilised in ""cases of emergency"" involving the
country's healthcare staff. He said the decision came after the phase three trial showed no adverse effects and that the vaccine was able to create antibodies. He added that 31,000 volunteers, representing 125 nationalities, had participated in the clinical trials. China-based Sinopharm CNG has developed
the vaccine and has been conducting the phase three clinical trial along with the

In aletter to parents,external, Stantonbury International School, in Milton Keynes, said all of Year Eight had been ""in close contact"" with the person. It said those pupils and ""a number of teachers"" would have to self-isolate for 14 days. The state-funded academy has about 1,600 pupils; all pupils, except Year Eight, were expected to return by Wednesday. Head teacher Alison Ramsay thanked parents for their ""understanding at this difficult time"".  As we told you earlier, there were a further 2,621 confirmed cases of coronavirus in the UK today - after three consecutive days with more than 3,000 positive tests. It means the seven-day average for daily infections now stands at 3,004. The marked rise in infections over the past week is in keeping with many other countries in Europe, notably Spain and France. Nine more deaths - within 28 days of a positive test - were reported by the UK government on Monday. Deaths remain low - compared to figures at the height of the lockdown in April and May - despite the current spike in infections. On average, there were 12 deaths a day over the past seven days.

But where else have cases been surging? Which countries are experiencing a second wave? And what about the US, which remains the country with both the highest number of cases and deaths? In the US, overall, the daily number of new cases is continuing to fall: Some European countries are experiencing second surges of cases of the virus, after getting their outbreaks under control over the summer: A number of countries outside Europe have experienced second surges, too. In Israel, the government is imposing a second national lockdown from Friday in an attempt to control the outbreak: And in some countries, cases have been rising steadily for months: Kat Kingsley said she would be wary of giving her details out again A woman said she was sent ""creepy"" messages by a city bus tour worker who got her details from her test-and-trace form. Kat Kingsley, 25, from Hayle in Cornwall, went on the Original Tour bus in Windsor on Thursday. On Sunday she received two messages from a member of staff at the company saying he wanted to see her. Original Tour said it had launched an investigation as it ""takes the matter extremely seriously"". Read more here Officials in Marseille say the city is facing a spike in coronavirus cases, and that hospitals are close to running out of space to treat people with the virus. All but four of Marseille's intensive care beds are in use, they say, and plans have been made to reallocate resources from other areas to deal with the increase in patients. The authorities have also imposed a number of new restrictions - including making it mandatory to wear masks outdoors in the worst-hit areas, and banning groups of more than 10 from meeting in beaches and parks. Cases have been surging across France. This weekend, the country reporteda single-day increase of more than 10,000 new coronavirus cases. Labour has accused the government of trying to ""exempt the bloodsport passions of their big donors"" from new coronavirus restrictions, after it emerged thatso-called 'rule of six' limitswould not apply to hunting. Government guidelines exempt activities shooting and paintball, as part of a wider exemption for sport that can be done with more than five others. Other activities which are excluded from the ""rule of six"" regulations include team sports such as football, hockey and netball. But shadow environment secretary Luke Pollard said: ""Across the country, people are struggling to get Covid-19 tests anywhere near their homes. ""But the Conservatives are distracted with trying to exempt the bloodsport passions of their big donors from coronavirus regulations. ""It shows where this Government's priorities really lie."" As we reported earlier, the World Health Organization (WHO) has said there has been a record single-day rise in the number of new coronavirus cases. According to the WHO, 307,930 new cases were reported over the past 24 hours. The biggest increases were in India, the US and Brazil. We've put together this chart showing where in the world cases are surging - and falling. Fewer than half of all coronavirus fines handed out in England and Wales since the end of March have been paid so far. Of the 19,171 fines handed out by police for breaching coronavirus restrictions, just 8,930 were paid. Figures published in the letter to the Justice Committee revealed 8,954 fixed penalty notices - 8,325 in England and 629 in Wales - have not been paid within the 28-day payment period, meaning prosecution may follow. Another 1,287 unpaid fines are still pending. Police were given powers to fine people for breaching coronavirus restrictions from 27 March, following the lockdown on 23 March. There have been 2,621 new cases of coronavirus recorded across the UK. It marks a fall of more than 600 cases on Sunday's figures, when 3,330 positive cases were recorded. However weekend figures are often lower, due to delays in reporting. A further nine deaths have been recorded since 09:00 on Sunday, bringing the total reported death toll across the UK to 41,628. A death is anyone who dies within 28 days of testing positive for Covid-19. This video can not be played How not to wear a face mask Does it matter if you wear your face mask wrong? Well, yes. Wearing a face mask or covering incorrectly can make it easier for coronavirus to spread. From today it is compulsory to wear face coverings in shops and indoor places in Wales for everyone aged 11 and over. Face coverings must also be worn in shops, supermarkets and shopping centres in England, Scotland and Northern Ireland. Read

The health body said the data of 18,105 Welsh residents was online for 20 hours on 30 August and it was viewed 56 times before it was removed. Most cases gave initials, date of birth, geographical area and sex, meaning the risk of identification was low, Public Health Wales said. However 1,928 people in living in communal settings were more at risk as nursing home residents or those living in supported housing also had the name of their place of residence published. The incident was the result of ""individual human error"" when the information was uploaded to a public server searchable by anyone using the site. Read

He added that 31,000 volunteers, representing 125 nationalities, had participated in the clinical trials. China-based Sinopharm CNG has developed
the vaccine and has been conducting the phase three clinical trial along with the

Healthcare. A secondary school in the UK has been closed and an entire year group asked to self-isolate, due to one confirmed case of coronavirus. In aletter to parents,external, Stantonbury International School, in Milton Keynes, said all of Year Eight had been ""in close contact"" with the person. It said those pupils and ""a number of teachers"" would have to self-isolate for 14 days. The state-funded academy has about 1,600 pupils; all pupils, except Year Eight, were expected to return by Wednesday. Head teacher Alison Ramsay thanked parents for their ""understanding at this difficult time"".  As we told you earlier, there were a further 2,621 confirmed cases of coronavirus in the UK today - after three consecutive days with more than 3,000 positive tests. It means the seven-day average for daily infections now stands at 3,004. The marked rise in infections over the past week is in keeping with many other countries in Europe, notably Spain and France. Nine more deaths - within 28 days of a positive test - were reported by the UK government on Monday. Deaths remain low - compared to figures at the height of the lockdown in April and May - despite the current spike in infections. On average, there were 12 deaths a day over the past seven days. Six the Musical will be at the Lyric theatre in London from 14 November Everybody's Talking About Jamie and Six will become the first musicals back in London's West End in mid-November, eight months after the curtain came down. They will hit the stage three weeks after a string of non-musical shows reopen London's theatre district. The Play That Goes Wrong, Agatha Christie's The Mousetrap and Adam Kay's This Is Going To Hurt will all admit socially distant audiences in October. Venue bosses said ""robust risk mitigation"" would be in place including reduced capacities, contactless tickets, temperature tests and deep cleans, as well as hand sanitation, face coverings and track and trace.

But where else have cases been surging? Which countries are experiencing a second wave? And what about the US, which remains the country with both the highest number of cases and deaths? In the US, overall, the daily number of new cases is continuing to fall: Some European countries are experiencing second surges of cases of the virus, after getting their outbreaks under control over the summer: A number of countries outside Europe have experienced second surges, too. In Israel, the government is imposing a second national lockdown from Friday in an attempt to control the outbreak: And in some countries, cases have been rising steadily for months: Kat Kingsley said she would be wary of giving her details out again A woman said she was sent ""creepy"" messages by a city bus tour worker who got her details from her test-and-trace form. Kat Kingsley, 25, from Hayle in Cornwall, went on the Original Tour bus in Windsor on Thursday. On Sunday she received two messages from a member of staff at the company saying he wanted to see her. Original Tour said it had launched an investigation as it ""takes the matter extremely seriously"". Read more here Officials in Marseille say the city is facing a spike in coronavirus cases, and that hospitals are close to running out of space to treat people with the virus. All but four of Marseille's intensive care beds are in use, they say, and plans have been made to reallocate resources from other areas to deal with the increase in patients. The authorities have also imposed a number of new restrictions - including making it mandatory to wear masks outdoors in the worst-hit areas, and banning groups of more than 10 from meeting in beaches and parks. Cases have been surging across France. This weekend, the country reporteda single-day increase of more than 10,000 new coronavirus cases. Labour has accused the government of trying to ""exempt the bloodsport passions of their big donors"" from new coronavirus restrictions, after it emerged thatso-called 'rule of six' limitswould not apply to hunting. Government guidelines exempt activities shooting and paintball, as part of a wider exemption for sport that can be done with more than five others. Other activities which are excluded from the ""rule of six"" regulations include team sports such as football, hockey and netball. But shadow environment secretary Luke Pollard said: ""Across the country, people are struggling to get Covid-19 tests anywhere near their homes. ""But the Conservatives are distracted with trying to exempt the bloodsport passions of their big donors from coronavirus regulations. ""It shows where this Government's priorities really lie."" As we reported earlier, the World Health Organization (WHO) has said there has been a record single-day rise in the number of new coronavirus cases. According to the WHO, 307,930 new cases were reported over the past 24 hours. The biggest increases were in India, the US and Brazil. We've put together this chart showing where in the world cases are surging - and falling. Fewer than half of all coronavirus fines handed out in England and Wales since the end of March have been paid so far. Of the 19,171 fines handed out by police for breaching coronavirus restrictions, just 8,930 were paid. Figures published in the letter to the Justice Committee revealed 8,954 fixed penalty notices - 8,325 in England and 629 in Wales - have not been paid within the 28-day payment period, meaning prosecution may follow. Another 1,287 unpaid fines are still pending. Police were given powers to fine people for breaching coronavirus restrictions from 27 March, following the lockdown on 23 March. There have been 2,621 new cases of coronavirus recorded across the UK. It marks a fall of more than 600 cases on Sunday's figures, when 3,330 positive cases were recorded. However weekend figures are often lower, due to delays in reporting. A further nine deaths have been recorded since 09:00 on Sunday, bringing the total reported death toll across the UK to 41,628. A death is anyone who dies within 28 days of testing positive for Covid-19. This video can not be played How not to wear a face mask Does it matter if you wear your face mask wrong? Well, yes. Wearing a face mask or covering incorrectly can make it easier for coronavirus to spread. From today it is compulsory to wear face coverings in shops and indoor places in Wales for everyone aged 11 and over. Face coverings must also be worn in shops, supermarkets and shopping centres in England, Scotland and Northern Ireland. Read

Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahuannounced new restrictions from Fridayfor at least three weeks. Scotland are due to host Israel at Hampden Park on 8 October.

Read more here The details of more than 18,000 people who tested positive for coronavirus were published online by mistake by Public Health Wales. The health body said the data of 18,105 Welsh residents was online for 20 hours on 30 August and it was viewed 56 times before it was removed. Most cases gave initials, date of birth, geographical area and sex, meaning the risk of identification was low, Public Health Wales said. However 1,928 people in living in communal settings were more at risk as nursing home residents or those living in supported housing also had the name of their place of residence published. The incident was the result of ""individual human error"" when the information was uploaded to a public server searchable by anyone using the site. Read

school for millions of Italian children today. I grew up learning the three Rs, but today Italian children have to know the three Ms: Mascherina, Mani, Metro (mask,
hands, metre). There was the usual mix of first-day excitement and nerves. Ten-year-old
Gabriele posed joyfully for a photo with his classmates in masks. His mother,
an A&E doctor, was impressed to see them greeting each other with elbow
bumps â not the usual bear hugs. ""The parents were far less disciplined,"" she
remarked. My seven-year-old is relieved to return to proper lessons
with teachers, instead of ""full-time homework"". But she is sad that coronavirus
means ""it's never going to be the same"". She's worried about playtime - ""what
happens when it rains?"" - and nervous about all the new rules. So are the
parents. Which entrance will they use? What if you have two kids at
the school? Borrowing in class is banned and everything has to be name-labelled.
Each individual pencil?! Masks can only be removed once children are seated at their
desks. At our school, washable masks aren't allowed: they must be surgical,
changed daily, and for now provided by the parents. Disappointingly, our class sizes haven't been reduced or
classrooms extended. Pigeon holes have simply been removed to make room to
space out the desks. Despite our worries, my daughter is looking on the bright side: ""At least nobody can nick my pencil sharpener."" Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking.",Positive,1.0
"This video can not be played Pupils at Olfcha Comprehensive get used to new systems at school Groups of children being told to self-isolate due to school Covid cases is to be expected, according to the education minister. Since term began, dozens of schools have reported cases and entire year groups have self-isolated. Pupils are being grouped together in ""bubbles"" in an attempt to limit the spread of the virus in the case of an outbreak. Kirsty Williams thanked affected schools for their ""immediate action"". After a staggered start to the term, all year groups are due back full time from Monday. Government guidance to schools says they should group pupils together and avoid contact between groups as much as possible, but how this is done will depend on each individual school. Public Health Wales data released at the end of last week indicated that there had been 36 cases in 31 schools. All Year 7 children at two Newport secondary schools were told to self-isolate after pupils tested positive for coronavirus and a Bridgend school told more than 200 pupils to stay at home. But the number of schools has risen over the weekend and it is believed it could be closer to 50. In Cardiff, eight pupils and three members of staff from Llanishen Fach Primary School have been asked to self-isolate. Another 57 pupils and two staff members from Whitchurch High School are also self isolating. A Welsh Government spokesperson said the operational guidance for schools made it clear that ""small, consistent groups help reduce the risk of transmission by limiting the number of learners and staff in contact with each other"". At Olchfa Comprehensive School in Swansea, head teacher Hugh Davies believes they are well-prepared. The school's 1,800 pupils are being organised in separate groups in six learning zones. ""Essentially what we're doing here is making sure that children of different age groups are kept separate - this is the idea that you might have heard of as the bubble,"" he said. ""So in our school's case we have six learning zones...and the idea is that those pupils come in separately at the start of the day, they take their breaks separately, they eat separately, they go home separately and therefore tracking and tracing can work more effectively if, God forbid, we had an outbreak. ""I think the name of the game at this point has to be to stay as calm as you can, to respond to events as they occur and just deal with them in a calm way."" Gagany, 14, said: ""At first I was quite anxious to go back because I thought there was no security measures put into place for school, because in Olchfa there is a lot of students and it's quite impossible to social distance everyone. ""But I think they found a method to find a good way to socially distancing everyone and we have our own bubble, so we stick to our bubble and we have a learning zone. ""By following these measures it keeps everyone safe and secure from the virus."" Max, 14, said: ""I think it's definitely taken a lot of getting used to, especially coming to school - there's certain gates we have to come through and zones you have to go through, rules you have to abide by. ""But I think anyone who's been alive in the last six months would understand how Covid works and the reasons we're taking the safety measures and I think that as long as everything's in place it's the best for everyone."" Danny, 14, said: ""They are very straightforward rules. ""Moving classroom to classroom you do notice it if you are paying attention to everything around, but the teaching hasn't changed. It's gone really smoothly."" Thomas, 14, said: ""I was initially quite worried... through lockdown up until we came back. But since we came back I've got more confident and it's a new normal, so we have obviously been in our bubbles and we've adapted to that very easily."" What are the rules on school buses in Wales?

About 3,000 undertakers in South Africa have gone on strike over pay and working conditions. As part of the strike they're refusing to collect bodies from people's homes and hospitals, and are also not holding burials. Their union wants the government to set up a coronavirus relief fund for the industry. Undertakers have struggled with the increasing cost of burials during the pandemic, because of the need for personal protective equipment (PPE), sanitiser and other extra protective items. But officials say they're worried the strike will cause a significant risk to public health. Macy's department store is making its famous Thanksgiving Day Parade a television-only special presentation, with no in-person spectators, the company said in a joint statement with the City of New York. Instead of going around the traditional 2.5-mile route, this year the parade will be staged solely around the Herald Square area of Midtown Manhattan. The first parade was staged in 1924, and has been a major fixture on the US festive calendar ever since. In recent years, more than 3.5m people have lined the streets each year to watch the parade in person. Faced with a surging coronavirus outbreak and poor working conditions, medical staff from across Morocco have been staging protests over the past few weeks. The country reported a record 2,430 cases last Friday, and has seen more than 1,000 new cases every day since July. Meanwhile, medical unions say some intensive care units are overrun and other wards are full. Morocco's Health Ministry has tried to raise capacity by setting up field hospitals - tents with beds and oxygen - but some medics say the main problem is staff shortages, particularly in rural areas. Anas Qarim, a nurse working at a Covid-19 hospital in Meknes, told Reuters news agency that they had just three nurses and two doctors to treat 120 patients. ""Imagine wearing full protective gear in the summer heat working continuously for hours,"" he said. There could be a second national lockdown in Wales if people fail ""to reconsider the choices we're making"", the health minister has warned. Vaughan Gething warned the pattern of increasing cases was ""similar to the situation we faced in early February"" - and that national lockdown remained an option. The number of new coronavirus cases in Wales increased by 183 on Monday - the largest rise in daily cases since 19 May, bringing the total number of confirmed cases in the country to 19,573. It comes as the government in Wales introduces mandatory face masks in all indoor public spaces and restricts more than six people from an extended household from meeting inside. ""If there isn't a change in behaviour, we could well be not just seven weeks away from a national lockdown, it could potentially be much quicker,"" Mr Gething said.

Social gatherings of more than six peopleÂ have become illegal in England.Versions of the ""rule of six"" -explained in detail- are now in place right across the UK and areÂ designed to provide clarity. However,Â there are significant differences betweenÂ nations. It applies indoors and out in England and Scotland, but not in Wales and Northern Ireland. In Scotland and Wales, children under 11 and 12 respectively are exempt. A reminder of why this is all being brought in -that crucial R number is rising. Every GP practice in England has been sent a lettertelling them they must make sure patients can access face-to-face appointments where needed. It follows concerns that vulnerable people have been shut out due to the pandemic. The Royal College of GPs said it was an ""insult"" to suggest its members hadn't been doing their jobs properly.

Mr Malthouse also echoed comments made by Justice Secretary Robert Buckland on Sunday, who said the billwas an ""insurance policy"". Labour's shadow business secretary, Ed Miliband, called the proposed law ""legislative hooliganism"". Mr Cox backed Brexit and was the government's top legal adviser when the withdrawal agreement was drawn up. He was replaced by fellow Brexiteer Suella Braverman in Februaryafter the prime minister asked him to resign. NI parties seek to amend Internal Market Bill Brexit bill powers 'insurance policy' for UK Blair and Major urge MPs to reject Brexit bill The UK left the EU on 31 January, having negotiated and signed the withdrawal agreement with the bloc. The two sides are now in the closing weeks of negotiations for a post-Brexit trade before the transition period ends on 31 December. A key part of the withdrawal agreement - which is now an international treaty - was the Northern Ireland Protocol, designed to prevent a hard border returning to the island of Ireland. The Internal Market Bill proposed by the government would override that part of that agreement when it came to goods and would allow the UK to modify or re-interpret ""state aid"" rules on subsidies for firms in Northern Ireland, in the event of the two sides not agreeing a future trade deal. Last week,Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis said the bill would ""break international law"" in a ""specific and limited way"", leading to swathes of criticism from all sides of the political spectrum. The latest critic is Mr Cox.writing in the Times,,externalhe said there was ""no doubt"" the ""unpalatable"" implications of the withdrawal agreement were known when the PM signed it. He wrote: ""We, the British government and Parliament, have given our word. Our honour, our credibility, our self-respect and our future influence in the world all rest upon us keeping that word."" The Tory MP said that there were lawful ways for the government to deal with its concerns, such as using a procedure set out in the agreement to take ""temporary and proportional measures"" to protect the UK's interests if approved by the Commons. ""What ministers should not do, however provoked or frustrated they may feel, is to take or use powers permanently and unilaterally to rewrite portions of an agreement into which this country freely entered just a few months ago,"" he added. Mr Malthouse called the response ""poetic"", but said it did not ""solve the problem that we're faced with"" over the future of trade with the EU. He told BBC Breakfast: ""What we've done is to say transparently that this is a situation which we think may occur - certainly that's what's being intimated from the EU. It's a problem we have to solve so here's a bill that solves it. ""In the end those people that oppose this bill have to tell us what the resolution is."" This video can not be played Robert Buckland: ""If I see the rule of law being broken in a way that I find unacceptable then of course I will go"" Labour's Mr Miliband said ""seeking to break international law [and] an agreement it signed"" is ""not normal"" for any government, calling it a ""sad day"" for the country. He told Radio 4's Today programme: ""We are known around the world for being the foundation with the Magna Carta for the rule of law.  If we want to strike trade deals with other countries, our word is our bond, and we are saying we are going to go back on our word we gave less than a year ago. ""It is self defeating, I fear."" Justice Secretary Mr Buckland told the BBC he hoped powers being sought by ministers would never be needed, and that he would resign if the UK ended up breaking international law ""in a way I find unacceptable"". The government's intentions have drawn widespread criticism, with former Prime Ministers Tony Blair and Sir John Major accusing Mr Johnson of ""embarrassing"" the UK. The former leaders were in office during key periods of the Northern Ireland peace process. The two urged MPs to reject the ""shameful"" attempt to override parts of the agreement,writing in the Sunday Times,externalthat the government's actions were ""irresponsible, wrong in principle and dangerous in practice"". The EU has warned the UK it could face legal action if it does not ditch controversial elements of the Internal Market Bill by the end of the month. THE RULE OF SIX:What's in the small print?

"This video can not be played David Cameron said he has âmisgivings about what is being proposedâ David Cameron has become the fifth former prime minister to criticise a new bill attempting to override the Brexit withdrawal agreement. No 10 says the Internal Market Bill was a ""critical piece of legislation for the UK"". But Mr Cameron said he had ""misgivings"" over it and breaking an international treaty should be the ""final resort"". Former Tory PMs Theresa May and Sir John Major, and Labour's Tony Blair and Gordon Brown have condemned the plan. However, Boris Johnson's official spokesman said the bill delivered a ""vital legal safety net"" so the government can ""take the necessary steps to ensure the integrity of UK's internal market"" - steps it hoped never to have to use. Brexit bill powers 'insurance policy' for UK Blair and Major urge MPs to reject Brexit bill 'Firm and strong' EU response expected - Irish PM MPs have begun debating the bill at its second reading, with the PM making the opening remarks, and it is expected to pass this early stage after a vote at around 22:00. But the legislation is likely to face more difficulties in its later stages, especially when the bill heads for debate in the Lords. Former Attorney General Geoffrey Cox accused Mr Johnson of doing""unconscionable"" damage to Britain's international reputationand said he would ""withhold"" his support for the bill in its current form. The PM's special envoy for Freedom of Religion or Belief, Tory MP Rehman Chishti,has resigned over the proposed law,external, saying: ""I have always acted in a manner which respects the rule of law... [and] voting for this bill as it currently stands would be contrary to the values I hold dearest."" A senior government source told the BBC ""all options are on the table"" in terms of possible action against Tory MPs who do not support the bill. Labour's shadow business secretary, Ed Miliband, also called the proposed law ""legislative hooliganism"". Mr Miliband will stand in for Sir Keir Starmer at the opposition dispatch box afterthe Labour leader was forced to self-isolate at homewhen a member of his household developed possible coronavirus symptoms. The UK left the EU on 31 January, having negotiated and signed the withdrawal agreement with the bloc. The two sides are now in the closing weeks of negotiations for a post-Brexit trade deal beforethe transition periodends on 31 December - with informal talks taking place in Brussels this week. A key part of the withdrawal agreement - which is now an international treaty - was the Northern Ireland Protocol, designed to prevent a hard border returning to the island of Ireland. The Internal Market Bill proposed by the government would override that part of that agreement when it came to goods and would allow the UK to modify or re-interpret ""state aid"" rules on subsidies for firms in Northern Ireland, in the event of the two sides not agreeing a future trade deal. Last week,Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis said the bill would ""break international law"" in a ""specific and limited way"", leading to swathes of criticism from all sides of the political spectrum. Here we go again... a Brexit deadline looms, there's a whole lot of noise about it in Westminster, and the UK and the EU can't agree. And yes, yet again, there is a swirling soup of jargon every other sentence. Take a few steps back though, and here is what this all amounts to - how the UK will trade with its nearest neighbours from January next year onwards and how the different parts of the UK will trade with each other. This matters economically - and matters politically too. The Brexit process has long exposed the tensions between the UK and Brussels, but don't underestimate the tensions it places on the UK as well. Those in Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales who have long argued to be unshackled from London, as they see it, argue Brexit is the ultimate case study to illustrate their argument. And so the government at Westminster's delicate task is to extricate the UK from one union, the EU, while holding together another one, the UK. All of these rows have that central aim at their core. Mr Cameron - who called the EU referendum when he was PM - said he had ""misgivings about what is being proposed"". Speaking to reporters, he said: ""Passing an act of Parliament and then going on to break an international treaty obligation is the very, very last thing you should contemplate. It should be the absolute final resort."" Mr Cameron said the ""bigger picture"" was about trying to get a trade deal with the EU, urging the government to ""keep that context [and] that big prize in mind."" The comments follow stronger criticism by the four other surviving former prime ministers of the UK. Mrs May, who still sits as an MP in the Commons, said breaking international law would damage ""trust"" in the UK, while Mr Brown said it would be akin to ""self-harm"" for the country. Sir John and Mr Blair - who were both in office during key periods of the Northern Ireland peace process -wrote a joint article in the Sunday Times,externalaccusing Mr Johnson of ""embarrassing"" the UK and urging MPs to reject the ""shameful"" attempt to override parts of the withdrawal agreement. Earlier, Policing Minister Kit Malthouse called the bill a ""practical"" step, saying it ""solves the problem that we're faced with"" over the future of trade with the EU. He told BBC Breakfast: ""What we've done is to say transparently that this is a situation which we think may occur - certainly that's what's being intimated from the EU. It's a problem we have to solve so here's a bill that solves it. ""In the end those people that oppose this bill have to tell us what the resolution is."" On Sunday, Justice Secretary Robert Buckland told the BBC the bill was an ""insurance policy"" in case the UK and EU do not agree a post-Brexit trade deal. He said he hoped powers being sought by ministers would never be needed, and that he would resign if the UK ended up breaking international law ""in a way I find unacceptable"". But Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer accused government ministers of handing out ""misinformation"" over the weekend and ""spinning"" the reasons they were pursuing the new bill. He told LBC: ""[Mr Johnson] is making a mistake reneging on a treaty - that will have reputational damage for the UK. ""I would say to the prime minister, look go away, go back to the drawing board, drop these problems, don't act in this reckless and wrong way and we'll look again at the legislation."" This video can not be played Robert Buckland: ""If I see the rule of law being broken in a way that I find unacceptable then of course I will go"" The bill has split opinion on the Tory backbenches. MP Sir Desmond Swayne said he would be supporting the bill, praising the government for preparing in case no trade deal is agreed by the end of the year. He told BBC News: ""If the government didn't take precautions against that possibility, it would be utterly negligent. It is right it arm itself with the powers just in case."" But his colleague, and chair of the Justice Select Committee, Sir Bob Neill, said the government and its supporters needed to ""calm the language"". He said there was already a mechanism for addressing the government's concerns, but he was willing to ""meet them half-way"" with an amendment to the bill - only allowing the elements that would break international law to be used if Parliament signs it off.

"JD Wetherspoon has said that 66 of its workers have tested positive for the coronavirus but maintains that visiting pubs is safe. The company, which employs more than 41,000 people, said the vast majority of its pubs had recorded no positive tests for the virus. There had been one or more cases among staff at 50 of its pubs. Wetherspoon's boss Tim Martin dismissed claims by disease expert Professor Hugh Pennington that pubs are ""dangerous"". He said: ""The situation with regard to pubs has been widely misunderstood."" Aberdeen University's Prof Pennington said last month that pubs are ""far, far more dangerous places to be"" when discussing sending children back to school during the pandemic. Since reopening on 4 July, the company said some 32 million people have visited its 861 open pubs. What are the rules when I go to the pub? Wetherspoon pubs set out post-lockdown plans Forty of its pubs have reported one worker testing positive for the coronavirus and six have disclosed two. In addition, two pubs reported three staff testing positive and another two said four workers had. A spokesman for Wetherspoon said the pubs have not been closed for a deep clean. The company said it has invested Â£15m in hygiene and social distancing measures at its premises. The spokesman said: ""The advice Wetherspoon has received from the public health authorities is that employees should self-isolate if they come into close contact with someone who has tested positive. Close contact means within 2 metres for 15 minutes or more or 1 metre for 1 minute or more. ""Unless social distancing policies have not been observed, the health authorities, in our experience, do not normally advise closure."" He added that since the company's pubs reopened: ""Staff are conducting regular surface cleaning and numerous hand sanitisers have been installed in each pub."" He said each premises is cleaned throughout trading and at the end of the day. Wetherspoon said 28 of the affected employees had returned to work. A spokesman for the company said the workers, as well as those who worked in close proximity to them, self-isolated for 14 days and were paid in full. The chain said signing up to the NHS track-and-trace system was mandatory in its premises. The company's spokesman said there was no list of the pubs that had been affected. ""Whenever there has been a situation we have dealt with the local press, public health and the council,"" he said. Mr Martin argued that pubs and shops were safer than homes. ""It is much easier to inadvertently pass on the virus in someone's house, where people are more relaxed and less vigilant,"" he said. From Monday, social gatherings of more than six people have been banned both indoors and outdoors in England and Scotland and indoors only in Wales. It follows a rise in new coronavirus cases, with a further 3,330 positive cases recorded in the UK on Sunday. Mr Martin said there had not been a rush of people coming to its pubs before the so-called ""rule of six"" was introduced and trade was 22.5% below the equivalent Saturday last year. He added: ""If pubs are closed, or restricted so much that they become unprofitable, a great deal of the strenuous effort of the hospitality industry's 3.2 million employees, currently engaged on upholding hygiene and social distancing standards, will be lost.""

It has the highest number of deaths in Latin America, with about 131,000 so far. The US has recorded almost a quarter of the world's total number of coronavirus cases - more than six million. It saw an increase in the number of daily cases in July, but the numbers have fallen since then. The US has the world's highest recorded death toll from Covid-19, with more than 194,000 fatalities. Countries across Europe are recording a rising number of daily cases amid fears of a resurgence of the virus.

"The humpback whale was found in Australia's East Alligator River Australian officials say they will try to guide a humpback whale out of a crocodile-infested river in the Northern Territory after it got lost and ended up 30km (18.5 miles) inland. The whale and others were on an annual sea migration when some of them ""took a wrong turn"", experts believe. Two whales were later able to swim out of the river, but at least one remains. It's the first known instance of a whale being found in crocodile territory so far inland in Australia. Given its estimated 16m (52 ft) length, the humpback is considered unlikely to be disturbed by crocodiles. But that risk could escalate if the whale were to become stranded in the shallow waters, officials said on Monday. The whales were spotted last week in the East Alligator River by people boating in the Kakadu National Park - Australia's biggest national park and a World Heritage-listed site. The sight of the animals swimming along the muddy bends of the river - so far from open water - has amazed locals. The whale swam about 30 km (18.5 miles) upstream ""It's something that's never been recorded before - not just in the Northern Territory - but [in] Australia. It's really, really unusual,"" said Carole Palmer, a marine ecosystems scientist for the territory's government. It was hard to determine if more than one whale needed assistance because of the river's ""murky brown water"", she added. Ms Palmer told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation that experts weren't sure ""why these whales took a wrong turn"" off the country's north coast. It is thought they had been heading south to Antarctica but mistakenly entered an estuary which took them further upstream into the river system. Whales migrate to warmer waters off Australia during spring to give birth before heading back to Antarctica to feed. Whale migration: Rare encounter on Great Barrier Reef Although the river teems with saltwater crocodiles, experts do not expect a confrontation. This video can not be played The East Alligator River connects to Cahills Crossing, a river bridge notorious in Kakadu for its proximity to crocodiles But if the whale becomes trapped in the shallow bends and washes up on a bank ""it's an easy feed for them,"" Ms Palmer told the ABC. ""There's no way we can lift a 12-16m humpback whale off the sandbar and that's potentially when the crocs would kick in."" To clear a path to the ocean, boats have been banned along part of the river. It had been hoped the whale would leave on its own, but it has remained around the deepest section of the river - about 20km from sea. Park rangers are trying to help the whale get out of the river system Ms Palmer said officials were considering several options to draw it out, such as using ""noisy sound"" from nearby boats or recordings of humpback whale calls. ""It's tricky on every level, but everyone is really trying to move forward with this in the most positive way that we can,"" she said. 'Super rare' whale encounter on Great Barrier Reef.

Video shared on social media showed Mr Walker being held down by two white deputies, one of whom punches him. In a statement, Clayton County Sheriff's Office said ""the deputy who repeatedly struck Roderick Walker"" was to lose his job ""for excessive use of force"". How are African Americans treated under the law? A criminal investigation has been turned over to the district attorney's office, the statement added. The incident, which happened on Friday near the Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport, comes amid heightened tensions in the US over racism and police brutality. Mr Walker's lawyer, Shean Williams, said his client had been a passenger in the lift-share car with his girlfriend, their five-month-old child and his stepson when police pulled them over.

Mr Walker became upset when he was asked for his identification as he hadn't been driving the car, Mr Williams said in a statement quoted by ABC News. ""He informed them that he did not have any ID and that he didn't need any since he was not driving a vehicle,"" he said. ""When they didn't like his question, they then demanded that he get out of a vehicle that he wasn't driving. It escalates to him being beaten on the ground, being tased, and almost dying. And they take him to jail."" In footage of the arrest, a child in the car yells ""Daddy"" and Mr Walker's girlfriend screams. One of the deputies says Mr Walker bit him. Mr Williams said that his client lost consciousness at least twice during the arrest and denied biting the deputy. A photograph of Mr Walker taken later in custody shows him with a swollen left eye.

""My reaction to the video is that it just shows, unfortunately, another incident where an African American male's civil rights have been violated by people and officers and law enforcement who have the duty first to protect and serve,"" Mr Williams said. Mr Walker is charged with two counts of obstructing officers and two counts of battery, ABC News reported. His family and his lawyers are pressing to have him released from jail. In recent months the US has been grappling with the treatment of African-Americans at the hands of the police, as well as wider questions about racism in society. Debates were triggered by the death in police custody in Minneapolis of another black man, George Floyd, in May. His death sparked protests around the country, and abroad, and has ignited calls for police reform in the US. More recently, the shooting of Jacob Blake, 29, in Wisconsin led to further violent protests. What's next after racial equity donations?

"The Trades Union Congress made a direct appeal to the chancellor on Monday The TUC's leader is asking for government action to avert ""mass unemployment"" amid the pandemic. Trades Union Congress general secretary Frances O'Grady has told its annual meeting the chancellor must ""stand by working families"" as the furlough scheme nears its end. She said: ""If the government doesn't act, we face a tsunami of job losses."" A government spokesperson said supporting jobs was ""an absolute priority"". Under the government's furlough scheme, workers placed on leave have been able to receive 80% of their pay, up to a maximum of Â£2,500 a month. Take-up has been significant,with 9.6 million workers furloughed since March.,external The scheme is due to finish at the end of October andChancellor Rishi Sunakhas repeatedly ruled out an extension to it. Speaking at the trade union body's congress in London on Monday, Ms O'Grady said time is running out to prevent huge job losses as the job retention scheme (JRS) comes to a close: ""Millions of livelihoods were saved [by the scheme] - both employees and the self-employed. From this Thursday, it will be just 45 days before the JRS ends. ""That's the notice period that companies have to give if they intend to make mass redundancies. The TUC also called for a new ""job protection and skills deal"" ""Rishi Sunak, stand by working families - don't walk away. It's so much better to keep people working, paying their taxes, spending and helping to rebuild the economy."" Furlough wind down: 'We prepared for the worst' Extend furlough scheme 'or risk second wave of job cuts' What happens when the furlough scheme ends? The trade unions body is also calling for a new ""job protection and skills deal"", which would include mandatory training and ""up-skilling"" for workers placed on furlough, for example. A government spokesperson said: ""Supporting jobs is an absolute priority which is why we've set out a comprehensive 'Plan for Jobs' to protect, create and support jobs across the UK by providing significant, targeted support where it is needed the most. ""We are continuing to support livelihoods and incomes through our Â£2bn Kickstart scheme, creating incentives for training and apprenticeships, a Â£1,000 retention bonus for businesses that can bring furloughed employees back to work, and doubling the number of frontline work coaches to help people find work. ""We are also supporting and protecting jobs in the tourism and hospitality sectors through our VAT cut and last month's Eat Out to Help Out scheme.""

"The Confederation of British Industry (CBI) is urging government to create new green jobs to lift productivity after the pandemic. Chief Dame Carolyn Fairbairn will say the UK must become a global leader in climate action at a virtual conference. She will say the next Budget should invest in low-carbon technologies such as hydrogen and carbon capture. A government spokesperson said the prime minister is ""committed to tackling climate change"". Dame Carolyn will open the industry body's first virtual conference about plans for zero emissions. It's a far cry from times past when the CBI used to warn that tackling climate change could destroy jobs. For several years now the group has promoted the opposite message: that targeted support for clean technologies can actually create jobs. The prime minister and some of his colleagues have spoken of the need for a âgreenâ recovery from the coronavirus pandemic. But Dame Carolyn says actions must now underpin those promises. She is expected to say: âFor so many, this feels like a time of fiercely competing goals. The world faces two seemingly separate yet fundamental problems - Covid-19, the biggest health crisis in living memory, and climate change â the defining challenge of the modern era. âBut they are not separate. The response to one affects success on the other. And the defining question is, how does the UK use this moment to rebuild our economy?"" Firms can't cope with no deal and virus - CBI boss Tax frequent fliers and get rid of SUVs, government told UK warned to avoid climate change crisis She says business urgently needs the government to publish a slew of policy documents. That includes a long-term carbon-cutting plan â along with the energy white paper, National Infrastructure Strategy, and plans for the decarbonisation of transport, heat and buildings. She will urge the UK to take a strong international lead: âTogether business and government can lay the foundations for a strong, sustainable future. ""Not just for the UK, but through our global leadership, beyond our shores as wellâ¦ a to-do list for this generation to pass on a better world to the next.â The CBIâs ""Green Recovery Roadmap"" outlines six priorities including: Accelerating the delivery of electric vehicle charging points and funding battery manufacturing Lifting the cap on auctions for renewable power and introducing a financing model for new nuclear capacity Becoming a leader in carbon capture, utilisation and storage technology Spending at least Â£1bn on testing hydrogen programmes and encouraging the production of hydrogen The CBI also wants Â£500m of government cash to support the UKâs first commercial sustainable fuel plant. A government spokesperson told BBC News: âThe prime minister is committed to tackling climate change and building back greener, and has set out his vision that the UK should have the most ambitious environmental programme of any country on earth.â They said ministers have set out billions in support for a low-carbon economy. Many policies were in train, they continued, with consultations on ending coal power and phasing out new petrol and diesel cars, supporting renewable energy projects across the UK and announcing over Â£3bn to transform the energy efficiency of the UKâs homes and public buildings.

"People should report their neighbours for any suspected breaches of new ""rule of six"" limits on social gatherings, the crime minister has said. Kit Malthouse urged residents to pass on details of suspected law-breaking through non-emergency numbers. From today, new rules restrict indoor and outdoor gatherings in England and Scotland, and indoor groups in Wales. They come after the UK'sreproduction, or R, number escalatedto between one and 1.2 for the first time since March. There were a further 2,621 confirmed cases of coronavirus in the UK on Monday, a fall after three consecutive days with more than 3,000 positive tests. But there have been widespread concerns about the availability of testing. Nine more deaths were reported within 28 days of a positive test. What are the new rules? Why is the R number so important? 'We've got four kids so can't see anyone else' Asked on BBC Radio 4's Today programme whether a person should report a gathering of seven or more in a neighbour's garden, Mr Malthouse said: ""It is open to neighbours to do exactly that through the non-emergency number. ""And if they are concerned and they do see that kind of thing, then absolutely they should think about it."" The crime and policing minister added there were ""discussions about what reporting mechanisms there might be, but there is obviously the non-emergency number (101) that people can ring and report issues they wish to"". National Police Chiefs' Council (NPCC) chairman Martin Hewitt denied that enforcement of the rule of six relied on people ""grassing up"" their neighbours. ""It relies on all of us being responsible,"" he told BBC Breakfast. BBC home affairs correspondent Daniel Sandford said guidance to police forces in England on how to enforce the new rule was not yet ready, so people were unlikely to be fined for a few days. Meanwhile, Prof Bobby Duffy, director of King's College London's policy institute, told the BBC that one in 20 people said in a survey of attitudes during the pandemic that they had reported others for rule breaches. Social gatheringsof more than six peoplein England, Scotland and Wales will not be allowed in lawfrom Monday 14 Septemberwith some exceptions The new ruleapplies to people in private homes, indoors and outdoors, and places such as pubs, restaurants, cafes and public outdoor spaces In Scotland, the rule appliesto a maximum of two householdsand in Wales it applies tothe same extended household Itapplies to all agesin England, but not to those aged12 and under in Scotland, and thoseunder 11 in Walesin those households The ruledoes not apply to schools, universities and workplaces, or weddings, funerals and organised team sports A full list of exemptionshas beenpublished in England,external Peoplewho ignore policecould be fined Â£100 - doubling with each offence to a maximum of Â£3,200 Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer told LBC he backed the rules, adding: ""You can make the argument of why not five or why not six or seven - you have to go with a number backed by the science and they say six, and I think we should abide by that rule."" Later, it was announced Sir Keir would self-isolate, after a family membershowed possible coronavirus symptoms. The new rules come into force amid reports that the UK's testing systems are overwhelmed, withScotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon expressing ""serious concern""over what she described as a backlog of results in the lab network. Alice Wiseman, Gateshead's director of public heath, told the BBC local authorities had requested a mobile testing unit on Saturday, only to see it arrive a day late with dozens of people directed elsewhere for tests. ""We're not able to do contact tracing unless we have a positive result,"" she said. ""In theory, there are potentially people walking around with Covid who just don't know."" Doris-Ann Williams, chief executive of laboratory testing industry body the British In Vitro Diagnostic Association, said delays to testing were being caused by a lack of staff and they were ""trying to desperately recruit more"" to increase capacity for the winter. Police in Bristol spoke to one mum at a toddler's picnic with seven people As the new law on gatherings came into force, police in Bristol were soon explaining the changes to confused members of the public. One mum was told her toddler's picnic - a group of seven - was now illegal. ""It's very difficult to understand though, if I'm allowed to be in a pub with a group of people a metre apart but I can't be with my kids' friends,"" she replied to the officer. Another woman, Nicky, said she thought her gathering of more than six was allowed because the children all attended school together. Groups like this would be allowed in nearby Wales and in Scotland, where children do not count towards the total. ""We could just go over the bridge and be with a much larger group of people,"" Nicky said. ""It does feel a bit unfair."" Most people were aware of the changes and kept to groups of six or fewer Elsewhere, the new rule brought hobbies and clubs to a halt. Jacky Wadsworth, secretary of Rockingham Brass Band in South Yorkshire, said their 28-person band was like a ""second family"" but now members would not be able to meet at the same time. They had hired a larger hall to allow for social distancing, but the new rules meant ""we are back to square one"". The ""rule of six"" in England - hailed as ""super simple"" by Health Secretary Matt Hancock - replaces guidance on allowing two households to meet indoors and a previous ban on gatherings which exceeded 30 people. Under the changes, larger gatherings are still allowed at gyms, schools, places of worship, weddings and funerals. Education and work settings are not affected. And new details of exemptions,externalpublished on Monday revealed that shooting, yachting and ultimate frisbee were among the sports that could continue in groups of more than six. Some Tory MPshave also urged No 10to exempt young children in England and called for a debate over the rules. TESTING:What tests are available? SYMPTOMS:What are they and how to guard against them? LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? TEST AND TRACE:How does it work? Groups larger than six can be broken up by police, with members of the group facing fines of Â£100 for a first offence, doubling on each further offence up to Â£3,200. But it emerged that fewer than half of people fined under existing coronavirus regulations in England and Wales had paid their penalties. A letter from the Attorney General,external, written on 25 August and published last week, said 46% of more than 19,000 fines issued were past the deadline for payment and could be considered for prosecution. In other developments: the government's chief scientific adviser sayshe was rebuked by other senior officials for arguing strongly in favour of a lockdownbefore it was imposed in March Downing Street said that about 99% of schools expected to reopen had done so, with only a ""very small number"" asking some pupils to stay at home due to outbreaks a new antibody treatment is to be trialledon Covid-19 patients in UK hospitals a ban on household visits affecting 1.75m people in Glasgow and the west of Scotland is to beextended for another week a British Medical Association survey of 8,000 doctors and medical students suggested a second peak of Covid-19 was their number one concern pub chain JD Wetherspoon insisted its venues were safe after it confirmed 66 of its workershad tested positive for coronavirus THE RULE OF SIX:What's in the small print?

"Alison Keen and her husband have four children so are already a group of six Indoor and outdoor social gatherings of more than six people will be banned in England from Monday as coronavirus restrictions are tightened. Although larger households are able to gather within their bubbles, some can no longer meet up with friends and family. Before the pandemic hit, Alison Keen had planned a big party for her 40th birthday on 21 September. When lockdown happened, she postponed it until 2021 and instead had hoped for a family gathering. But now that too cannot go ahead. She and her husband have four children, meaning the new""rule of six""applies solely to their family. ""I can't meet up with anyone just because I've got kids,"" said Mrs Keen, from Newcastle-under-Lyme, Staffordshire. ""Mum's upset that she can't see me on my birthday and really annoyed that she could have come to see the kids last week, but not next week."" Mrs Keen said allowing her children, between six and 11, to go back to school but not have family gatherings ""seems daft"". The family had thought her parents, who live in Birmingham, would be able to see Mrs Keen's two sisters, who both have fewer children. But from Tuesdayadditional restrictions in Birmingham will prevent this. Mrs Keen's four children have all recently returned to school Prime MinisterBoris Johnson announced the new rules""to avoid a second national lockdown"" as the rate of infection climbs across the country. It applies both indoors and outdoors and to all ages - although there are some exemptions, such as gatherings for work or school. The new rules will be enforced by police who will have powers to issue fines and make arrests. ""I get they're trying to simplify the rules, but that's not how viruses work,"" said Mrs Keen. ""At the end of the day it's a new virus and as you learn, policies have to evolve. But it feels awful."" This video can not be played The prime minister said the new measures were ""not another national lockdown"" Dee Jones, a mum of six from Telford, in Shropshire, said the new restrictions means she won't be able to see all of her children, five of whom have moved out and married. She works two jobs and so only has one weekend off each month - the family would normally use that weekend to get together for a big meal. ""We can't do that now, unless my son-in-law sits out in the garden and eats his dinner there."" The ""rule of six"" will make it almost impossible to arrange seeing her family and already they are having to do so ""almost on a rota"". She said a turkey, bought for the family's Easter meal, had been ""stuck in the freezer all throughout lockdown - if I didn't laugh about it I would have cried"", adding she was finding the restrictions ""quite depressing"". ""Honestly, it's ridiculous. I'm frustrated. We've done what we've been advised and there are clearly people out there who haven't."" Stephanie Raheel, from Yardley in Birmingham, has three children, Alina, Amaya and Arissa. Her husband's parents are at the heart of their family and they would usually meet them regularly with extended family members. To go back to stricter measures will be hard, she said, ""especially for the children - it's hard for them to understand"". Latest news and updates from the West Midlands So how many friends can I meet - and where? What can police do if I break the new rules? Mrs Raheel's children, aged between three and six, have returned to school and nursery but she worries the restrictions will mean the older people in her family will miss out on special moments with her young daughters. ""Within our family we've had two babies born in lockdown,"" she said. ""The key moments, you want to celebrate with your loved ones. ""The grandparents too, they love to see the little ones."" Birmingham has the second highest rate of infections in England - 85.4 per 100,000 people Mrs Raheel said her mother-in-law is due to have an eye operation next week, something her husband and his six brothers are keen to support her with. ""We'll all just want to go and see her and check she's OK - when people are in need, it's difficult.""

"GP practices are being told they must make sure patients can be seen face to face when they need such appointments. NHS England is writing to all practices to make sure they are communicating the fact doctors can be seen in person if necessary, as well as virtually. It's estimated half of the 102 million appointments from March to July were by video or phone call, NHS Digital said. The Royal College of GPs said any implication GPs had not been doing their job properly was ""an insult"". NHS England said research suggested nearly two thirds of the public were happy to have a phone or video call with their doctor - but that, ahead of winter, they wanted to make sure people knew they could see their GP if needed. Nikki Kanani, medical director of primary care for NHS England, said GPs had adapted quickly in recent months to offer remote consultations and ""safe face-to-face care when needed"". How GPs are changing the way they work UK faces 'balancing act' Who would get a vaccine - and how? She added: ""While many people, particularly those most vulnerable to Covid-19, want the convenience of a consultation over the phone or video, the NHS has been and will continue to offer face-to-face appointments and I would urge anyone who feels they need medical support to come forward so they can get the care, support and advice they need - the NHS is here for you."" NHS England said it would be reminding GPs they faced enforcement action if they failed to offer face-to-face appointments when necessary on medical grounds. Failure to do so was a breach of their contract, it said. Prof Martin Marshall, chair of the Royal College of GPs, said general practice was ""open and has been throughout the pandemic"", with a predominantly remote service to help stop the spread of coronavirus. This video can not be played Dr Debbie Noland wears full PPE when seeing patients and cleans the examination room between patients He said: ""The college does not want to see general practice become a totally, or even mostly, remote service post-pandemic. ""However, we are still in the middle of a pandemic. We need to consider infection control and limit footfall in GP surgeries - all in line with NHS England's current guidance."" He said most patients had understood the changes and that clinical commissioning groups had been asked to work with GP practices where face-to-face appointments were not possible - for example, if all GPs were at a high risk from coronavirus. ""Any implication that they have not been doing their job properly is an insult to GPs and their teams who have worked throughout the pandemic, continued delivering the vast majority of patient care in the NHS and face an incredibly difficult winter ahead,"" he said. Research from the college indicated that routine GP appointments were back to near-normal levels for this time of year, after decreasing at the height of the pandemic. ""Each and every day last week an estimated third of a million appointments were delivered face to face by general practices across the country,"" added Prof Marshall. TESTING:What tests are available? SYMPTOMS:What are they and how to guard against them? LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? LOCAL LOCKDOWNS:What happens if you have one? TEST AND TRACE:How does it work? It comes as thousands of doctors say a second peak is likely this winter - and is their greatest fear. The British Medical Association survey of more than 8,000 doctors and medical students found that 86% of them believed a second peak was likely, or very likely, in the next six months. The survey indicated doctors thought the two most important measures to help prevent such a peak were having a fit-for-purpose test-and-trace system and a ""coherent, rapid and consistent approach to local outbreaks"". BMA council chair Dr Chaand Nagpaul said: ""We, as a profession, want, above all, to avoid a return to the scenes we saw in April, when hospitals were full with Covid-19 patients, and hundreds were dying every day. Meanwhile, thousands of others missed out on vital appointments and procedures as routine care was put on hold. ""But while the forecast in this survey may be bleak, it is not an inevitability if the government takes decisive, robust and timely action to stamp down the spread of the infection."" He called on the government to focus on ""sorting out the test-and-trace debacle once and for all"", adding: ""We are at a critical crossroads in the fight against this deadly virus.""

"This video can not be played Police made dozens of arrests as opposition supporters gathered for the march Tens of thousands of people have been marching in the capital Minsk and other cities, in the latest of several weeks of mass protest against President Alexander Lukashenko. Large numbers of police have been deployed, blocking key areas. Police said they arrested about 400 people ahead of and during the protests, dubbed the March of Heroes. The protests have been triggered by a widely disputed election a month ago and subsequent brutal police crackdown. Demonstrators want Mr Lukashenko to resign after alleging widespread ballot-rigging. But the Belarusian leader - in power for 26 years - has denied the allegations and accuses Western nations of interfering. The 66-year-old has promised to defend Belarus. Most opposition leaders are now under arrest or in exile. It is the fifth successive Sunday of mass protests, with about 100,000 rallying each week. This video can not be played The BBC's Jonah Fisher reports from Minsk as police turn their sights on female protesters Eyewitnesses said the centre of Minsk was flooded with people. They marched on the elite residential area of Drozdy, where the country's top officials including President Lukashenko live, but were blocked by police. Rallies are also being held in Brest, Gomel, Mogilyev and other cities. Europe's longest-serving ruler under fire What's happening in Belarus? 'Breathing freedom' - Belarusians hope for change However, the Interior Ministry said that as of 15:00 local time (12:00 GMT) the protests involved no more than 3,000 people across the country. Mr Lukashenko has refused to make any concessions to the opposition The ministry said arrests were made in various districts of the capital, and that those detained were carrying flags and placards ""of an insulting nature"". Analysis by BBC correspondent Jonah Fisher In many ways Sunday's demonstration was similar to previous weeks. When the march was at full strength the riot police had little choice but to watch on as the protesters filled the streets and waved their red and white flags. The now famous ""Goose for a free Belarus"" was there, a bow tie round its neck, flapping its wings and posing for selfies. Plenty of families came too, determined to enjoy the warm weather. It's on the side streets, and in the exposed moments when people arrive and disperse in smaller groups that the security forces strike. It's not dignified or disciplined. The police, their faces usually covered, launch crude tackles at the protesters before dragging them kicking and screaming into waiting minivans. After five Sundays of huge demonstrations there's still no sign of enthusiasm dwindling or that the threat of violence is stopping people from coming. Video footage showedmen in balaclavas pulling people out of the crowds,externalgathering for the start of the march and taking them to unmarked minibuses. Protests were triggered by elections on 9 August, in which Mr Lukashenko was handed an overwhelming victory amid widespread reports of vote-rigging. Why Poland is backing the opposition in Belarus Belarus election: 'He threatened to burn us alive' 'If we step back now we will become slaves' Violent clashes on several nights following the poll led to thousands of arrests, and details emerged of severe beatings by police and overcrowding in detention centres. This produced a new wave of demonstrations, with weekend rallies drawing tens of thousands. Mr Lukashenko has said he may establish closer ties with Russia, his main ally. On at least two occasions in the past few weeks, he has been photographed near his residence in Minsk carrying a gun and being surrounded by his heavily armed security personnel.
