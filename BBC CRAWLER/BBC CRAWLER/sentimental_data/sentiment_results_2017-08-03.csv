"This video can not be played Queen Margrethe married Prince Henrik in 1967 Prince Henrik of Denmark will not be buried next to his wife Queen Margrethe, royal officials say, with the prince unhappy at never being designated her equal. The 83-year-old has long complained at being named as prince rather than king. It had been expected that the pair would be buried together in a specially-designed sarcophagus at Roskilde Cathedral. The queen, 77, is said to have accepted her husband's decision. ""It is no secret that the prince for many years has been unhappy with his role and the title he has been awarded in the Danish monarchy,"" the Royal Danish House's director of communications told the tabloid BT. ""For the prince, the decision not to be buried beside the queen is the natural consequence of not having been treated equally to his spouse - by not having the title and role he has desired."" Born Henri Marie Jean AndrÃ© de Laborde de Monpezat in France in 1934, he and the queen have two sons. Henrik retired from public life last year. The royal house said despite rumours to the contrary the prince wants to be buried in Denmark rather than France.

"Robert Mueller has not given details himself of the investigation The special counsel investigating claims of Russian meddling in the US election has begun using a grand jury in Washington, reports say. The move suggests Robert Mueller may be taking a more aggressive approach to gathering data on possible collusion with Donald Trump's campaign team. Grand juries are used to issue subpoenas to compel people to testify. The president has again poured scorn on the inquiry, telling a rally in West Virginia it was a ""total fabrication"". What is a grand jury? Trump: US-Russia relations are at 'dangerous low' The Trump-Russia saga in 200 words Russia: The 'cloud' over the White House In the US, grand juries are composed of members of the public who hear evidence in secret. Prosecutors use them to gather evidence, as they can compel people to testify or hand over documentation. They consider whether evidence is strong enough to issue indictments for a criminal trial. The juries do not decide the innocence or guilt of a potential defendant. Prosecutors have for months been using a grand jury in the Eastern District of Virginia, which had issued some subpoenas in the case, reports say. This video can not be played All you need to know about the Trump-Russia investigation Mr Mueller has now opted for one of the several grand juries that sit in Washington, and reportedly began using it several weeks ago. Analysts say it shows Mr Mueller is taking full control of the investigation. He has already replaced most of the prosecutors originally on the case, in favour of his own legal minds. The switch from Virginia to Washington is also more practical. Mr Mueller's office will be closer and he knows the Washington federal courthouse better. As grand juries are secret, there will be no disclosure. Mr Mueller himself has given no details. It is clear Mr Mueller is investigating a meeting in June last year, in which Mr Trump's son, Donald Jr, and his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, met a Russian lawyer. Mr Trump Jr has admitted he was promised damaging material on Mr Trump's rival in the presidential race, Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton, though he says none was forthcoming. According to Reuters news agency, the special counsel is examining whether anyone affiliated with the Trump campaign encouraged the Russians to start releasing material about the Clinton campaign. Mr Mueller is reportedly seeking to determine whether Mr Trump knew of his son's meeting before it happened, or if he was briefed on it afterwards. US media have also quoted sources close to the investigation as saying that the special counsel is looking into whether President Trump obstructed justice when he fired FBI chief James Comey, who was leading the previous investigation into Russian interference. Mr Mueller was then appointed in May by the deputy attorney general of the Department of Justice to continue the inquiry. Mr Mueller is also reportedly investigating the financial dealings of former Trump campaign chief Paul Manafort as well as those of Michael Flynn, who Mr Trump sacked as national security adviser because he failed to disclose his Russian contacts. Mr Trump was his defiant self at a rally in Huntington, West Virginia, on Thursday evening. Donald Trump in West Virginia: ""We didn't win because of Russia, we won because of you"" Mr Trump said the allegations were a ""hoax"" that were ""demeaning to our country"". ""The Russia story is a total fabrication,"" he said. The crowd went wild as he continued: ""Most people know there were no Russians in our campaign. There never were. We didn't win because of Russia, we won because of you."" Ty Cobb, a lawyer appointed last month as White House special counsel, said he had been unaware a grand jury was being used. But he added: ""Grand jury matters are typically secret. The White House favours anything that accelerates the conclusion of [Mr Mueller's] work fairly. The White House is committed to fully co-operating with Mr Mueller."" Another Trump lawyer, John Dowd, told Associated Press: ""With respect to the news of the federal grand jury, I have no reason to believe that the president is under investigation."" Anthony Zurcher, BBC North America reporter Robert Mueller's special counsel investigation has always been a concern for the Trump administration. Now it's deadly serious business. With the news that a grand jury has been convened in Washington DC, and that it is looking into the June 2016 meeting between Donald Trump Jr and Russian nationals, it's clear the investigation is focusing on the president's inner circle. This news shouldn't come as a huge shock, given that Mr Mueller has been staffing up with veteran criminal prosecutors and investigators. It is, however, a necessary step that could eventually lead to criminal indictments. At the very least it's a sign that Mr Mueller could be on the trail of something big - expanding the scope beyond former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn and his questionable lobbying. It also indicates his investigation is not going to go away anytime soon.

"Marcus Hutchins wanted to remain anonymous after the WannaCry outbreak, but his identity was revealed British cyber-security researcher Marcus Hutchins will appear in court in Las Vegas later charged in a US cyber-crime case. The 23-year-old has been accused of involvement with Kronos - a piece of malware used to steal banking logins from victims' computers. Mr Hutchins, from Ilfracombe in Devon, came to prominence after he stalled the WannaCry cyber-attack which hit the NHS in May. The FBI arrested him on Wednesday. The UK's National Cyber Security Centre has said it was aware of the situation with fellow cyber-security researchers expressing surprise at the indictment. WannaCry spread rapidly through computer systems around the world, in an unprecedented outbreak that began on 12 May. Shortly afterwards, Mr Hutchins was thrust into the limelight after he found a way to stop it from spreading. He had been in Las Vegas attending the Black Hat and Def Con cyber-security conferences, but activity on his Twitter feed - usually highly active - ceased two days ago. ""Marcus Hutchins... a citizen and resident of the United Kingdom, was arrested in the United States on 2 August, 2017, in Las Vegas, Nevada, after a grand jury in the Eastern District of Wisconsin returned a six-count indictment against Hutchins for his role in creating and distributing the Kronos banking Trojan,"" the US Department of Justice (DoJ) said in a statement. ""The charges against Hutchins, and for which he was arrested, relate to alleged conduct that occurred between in or around July 2014 and July 2015."" It is not known where Mr Hutchins is being held in custody. Kronos is malware that is designed to steal banking login and other financial data from infected computers. The DoJ's indictment is dated 12 July, before Mr Hutchins arrived in the US. It alleges that he created and sold Kronos on internet forums, including the AlphaBay dark web market,which was recently shut downafter an international law enforcement operation. His mother, Janet Hutchins, said it was ""hugely unlikely"" that her son was involved, saying he had spent ""enormous amounts of time and even his free time"" stopping attacks like these. A second defendant is also included in the indictment, but their name has not been made public. Mr Hutchins tweeted about Kronos shortly after it was reported in the press: ""Anyone got a Kronos sample?"" he wrote. Mr Hutchins tweets under the pseudonym 'MalwareTech' People, who work with Mr Hutchins investigating malware, have said ""it looks like the US justice system has made a huge mistake"". He was arrested while at an airport, his colleagues say, and has not been allowed visitors. Digital rights groups have said they are ""deeply concerned"" by Mr Hutchin's situation. A spokesman for the UK's National Cyber Security Centre said: ""This is a law enforcement matter and it would be inappropriate to comment further."" The DoJ has said Mr Hutchins' case was investigated by the FBI's cyber-crime unit in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. The British Consulate in Los Angeles said it is in contact with the local authorities in Las Vegas and was providing support to his family. The AlphaBay dark web market went offline earlier this month US cyber-attorney Tor Ekeland said Mr Hutchins could face ""40 years in jail"" if found guilty but admitted the case had not named any victims. Speaking on Radio 4's Today, he said alleging that writing software of this type is potentially illegal is ""highly problematic"" for the information security industry. ""I can think of a number of examples of legitimate software that would potentially be a felony under this theory of prosecution."" This video can not be played Marcus Hutchins could face ""decades in jail"", computer-crime attorney Tor Ekeland tells Radio 4's Today Kronos is a type of malware known as a Trojan, meaning it disguises itself as legitimate software. It is thought to be named after a mythological creature. Kronos first came tolight in July 2014,external, when it was advertised on a Russian underground forum for $7,000 (Â£5,330) - a relatively high figure at the time. It was marketed as way to steal logins for banking websites and other financial data. Its vendor boasted it could evade existing anti-virus software and said it worked with the latest versions of Internet Explorer, Firefox and Chrome web browsers. In an unusual step, the developer promised free upgrades and bug fixes and the option of a $1,000 one week trial. After much publicity it faded from view until October 2015, whenIBM researchers reported,externalthat Kronos had been spotted in attacks on UK and Indian bank websites. Kronos then struck again in May 2016, when the cyber-security firm Proofpoint reported it had been used to target customers ofCanadian financial institutions,external. In November Proofpoint reported it hadspotted the Trojan being,externaldistributed via emails sent to organisations involved in the financial services, hospitality, higher education and healthcare industries. The messages contained attachments and links that claimed to be related to Microsoft Sharepoint documents, but in fact led victims' computers to be infected with other malware, including a credit card number-stealing tool.

"Hardy's children described him as 'gruff, elegant, twinkly and always dignified' The actor Robert Hardy, star of TV series All Creatures Great and Small, has died aged 91, his family has said. Hardy, they said, had a ""tremendous life"" and ""a giant career in theatre, television and film spanning more than 70 years"". He was also known for numerous portrayals of Winston Churchill. In more recent years, he appeared as Cornelius Fudge, the Minister for Magic, in four of the Harry Potter films. Robert Hardy: A life in pictures His family said: ""Gruff, elegant, twinkly, and always dignified, he is celebrated by all who knew him and loved him, and everyone who enjoyed his work."" His children Emma, Justine and Paul said in the statement: ""Dad is also remembered as a meticulous linguist, a fine artist, a lover of music and a champion of literature, as well a highly respected historian, and a leading specialist on the longbow. ""He was an essential part of the team that raised the great Tudor warship The Mary Rose."" Hardy as Cornelius Fudge in 2007's Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix With his instantly recognisable voice and British bulldog manner, Robert Hardy enjoyed a distinguished acting career which spanned seven decades. By the time he endeared himself to television audiences in the BBC's All Creatures Great and Small, he had already carved out a reputation as one of Britain's most versatile actors. While his earlier career gave him a firm grounding in the theatre his best known roles were in front of the camera - particularly in television, a medium he obviously enjoyed. Read the full obituary Hardy, from Cheltenham, Gloucestershire, started his acting career at the age of 24 with the Shakespeare Memorial Company in Stratford, later the Royal Shakespeare Company, starring in a stage adaptation of Coriolanus.

Timothy said he had last seen Hardy 18 months ago and found him ""frail, yet still sparkly and twinkly."" ""He was a very clever fellow,"" he went on. ""I remember once on set he was talking about manure, and his description of the smell was poetry.""

"MPs have enjoyed free activities from Wimbledon to Glastonbury, according to their latest register of interests. Speaker John Bercow, a tennis fan, got two Royal Box tickets for Wimbledon, with an estimated value of Â£8,590. Labour deputy leader Tom Watson also got two cheaper Wimbledon tickets while Tory Damian Collins and Nigel Adams declared Glastonbury tickets. Meanwhile Theresa May registered a discount card from shoe shop Russell & Bromley. The prime minister, whose love of shoes is well documented, has worn the retailer's shoes to Conservative Party conferences and registered a discount card valid from January 2017 to January 2018 - without details of what it entitled her to. Several MPs went to Glastonbury - some went free courtesy of complimentary tickets The Labour Party said Mr Watson had received his tickets in his capacity as shadow sport secretary. Conservative Mr Collins is chairman of the Commons Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Select Committee while Mr Adams is also a committee member. Labour Leader Jeremy Corbyn - whose speech on Glastonbury's Pyramid Stage drew thousands - had previously declared two tickets worth Â£476 but said they were given to a family member. As a speaker at the event, he did not need a ticket.

Michelle Carter, now 20, will serve 15 months of her term behind bars and five years of probation. Carter was convicted in June of the involuntary manslaughter of Conrad Roy, who took his own life on 13 July 2014. Mr Roy's father told Thursday's hearing: ""My family is heartbroken. My son was my best friend."" What the texting suicide case tells us Carter was allowed to remain free pending an appeal. She had faced a maximum sentence of 20 years, but her legal team argued that both she and Mr Roy suffered from mental illness. Dressed in red trousers and a cream blouse, Carter stood tearfully with hands clasped and eyes cast down as she was sentenced. ""Her actions killed Conrad Roy,"" the prosecutor told the court. ""She ended his life to better her own."" ""She has not accepted responsibility,"" she said. ""She has shown no remorse."" But Carter's lawyer said it was a ""horrible circumstance that she completely regrets"". This video can not be played How text messages led to a suicide However, Judge Lawrence Moniz said he did not find that her ""age or level of maturity or even her mental illness have any significant impact on her actions"". A prosecutor read a statement from Mr Roy's mother, Lynn Roy, saying there was ""not one day I do not mourn the loss of my beloved son"". Michelle Carter: What the texting suicide case tells us ""I want him to be proud of me and how I am handling everything - I am trying to be there for his sisters in all of my pain we will carry with us for eternity,"" it said. Mr Roy's sister, Camdyn Roy, testified that she was ""haunted"" by the realisation that she would never attend her brother's wedding or be an aunt to his children. ""Not having that one person I've been with every day since birth is a pain I'll always keep with me for the rest of my life,"" she said. Carter reportedly texted Mr Roy that his parents would ""get over"" his suicide The case appears to set a legal precedent, as there is no Massachusetts law that criminalises telling a person to commit suicide. Carter was 17 when Mr Roy was found dead of carbon monoxide poisoning in a vehicle in 2014. The case drew national attention after Carter's text messages revealed she had encouraged him to end his life. ""Hang yourself, jump off a building, stab yourself I don't know there's a lot of ways,"" she said in several messages sent in the two weeks before his death while he was on holiday with his family. In the moments before his suicide, she wrote: ""You need to do it, Conrad"" and ""All you have to do is turn the generator on and you will be free and happy."" Judge Moniz said Carter sought attention through Mr Roy's death, ordering that she not be allowed to profit from the case through any press. The case has divided legal opinion. Among the few to defend Carter was Amanda Knox, who was convicted of murdering her British roommate in Italy in 2007 before she was cleared two years ago. Ms Knox, 30, published anop-ed in the Los Angeles Times,externalsaying: ""Michelle Carter deserves sympathy and help, not prison.""

"Moisturiser holds the water in the skin and protects against dryness Actress Helen Mirren has been quoted - in colourful language - saying that moisturiser probably does nothing at all for the skin. Is she right? Not really. If you have dry skin, moisturiser does help by supplying water to the skin and trapping it there. Most moisturisers contain a greasy substance that holds the water in. Many years ago, moisturisers were very greasy on the skin - but now there are huge numbers of moisturisers and creams for sale, each one with a slightly different mix of ingredients. The key, according to Dr Sweta Rai, from the British Association of Dermatologists, is finding one that suits your skin type and feels comfortable. ""A moisturiser's job is to maintain an outer armour on the skin, which prevents against infection and helps skin conditioning,"" she says. ""If you're using a good moisturiser for you, then it will be doing a good job for your skin."" For oily skins, she recommends lotions that contain more water. For dry skins, the advice is to choose ointments or creams that contain a little more oil. Dr Rai says ""many people are probably using the wrong moisturiser"". The Oscar-winning actress Helen Mirren is the face of one of L'Oreal's moisturiser ranges Dr Rai suggests using a sun cream with a sun protection factor (SPF) of 30 as a moisturiser - that way it can protect against the Sun's rays, be reapplied regularly and keep the skin hydrated. And she says it is possible to get a good moisturiser for under Â£10. But standard moisturisers don't stop wrinkles or ageing, she says. However,scientists who tested a cream with anti-ageing ingredients,externalin 2012 did find that it appeared to smooth out wrinkles in some people. As babies, we all start out with wonderfully smooth skin. During puberty, glands in the skin start producing oil, and as we age, exposure to sun, cold weather and central heating systems all dry out the skin. In winter the skin naturally dries out more, and in summer the skin naturally produces oils - but dry skin affects most people to some degree all year round. It isn't a medical issue normally, but it can become one if the skin becomes sore, tender, itchy and inflamed. An article from Harvard Medical School,externalsets out the ingredients in moisturiser and explains why they help with dry skin. water soaks into the skin occlusives hold water in humectants draw water up from the skin emollients make the skin feel smooth lactic acid makes skin more flexible The article says: ""You really can't go very wrong. ""Almost all the moisturisers on the market will help with dry skin, and in most cases, the choice comes down to subjective experience."" Turn down the heating - hot air is usually drier than cooler air Take warm baths and showers - not hot ones, because hot water takes away fatty substances in the skin that help retain water Use bath oils diluted in some warm water, which are a good post-bath moisturiser Use a mild soap - cleansers are an alternative Wear loose clothing because tight clothes that rub can dry out skin Stay protected in the cold - chilly air can be very drying Bye bye fake tan!

"Rashan Charles died after being apprehended by police in Dalston A man who died after a police chase in London had a package in his throat containing ""a mixture of paracetamol and caffeine"", investigators have said. Rashan Charles wasfollowed by officers in Dalston on 22 Julyand became ill after putting an object in his mouth. In a statement, the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) said the package was ""wrapped in plastic"". Commissioner Cindy Butts added the police watchdog had not yet been given a confirmed cause of death. Mr Charles' death sparked a number of protests in east London,including one which turned violent. Violence broke out in Kingsland Road during a protest over the death of Mr Charles Ms Butts said the IPCC had decided to release information about what was in the package ""given the inflammatory nature of some ongoing speculation"". Last week the police watchdog said the evidence it had seen so far suggested the 20-year-old had been followed by a police officer into a shop on Kingsland Road. The officer then restrained Mr Charles and attempts were made to remove an object from his mouth or throat. His condition later deteriorated and a police medic was called to provide assistance before paramedics arrived. Ms Butts said the IPCC echoed the family's appeal for calm after a wave of angry protests and violent clashes amid accusations of alleged police brutality. The police watchdog's announcement came after shadow home secretary Diane Abbott said the initial forensic findings would cause ""deep concern"" after  figures showed a ""disproportionate"" use of force against minority groups by police. On Tuesday figures released for the first time showed Metropolitan Police officers used ""force"" at a rate of around once every 10 minutes. There were 12,605 incidents of force against people by individual officers registered in the three months to the end of June. The data showed 45% of the individuals subject to force were white, 36% black and 10% from the Asian community.

"Robert Mueller has not given details himself of the investigation The special counsel investigating claims of Russian meddling in the US election has begun using a grand jury in Washington, reports say. The move suggests Robert Mueller may be taking a more aggressive approach to gathering data on possible collusion with Donald Trump's campaign team. Grand juries are used to issue subpoenas to compel people to testify. The president has again poured scorn on the inquiry, telling a rally in West Virginia it was a ""total fabrication"". What is a grand jury? Trump: US-Russia relations are at 'dangerous low' The Trump-Russia saga in 200 words Russia: The 'cloud' over the White House In the US, grand juries are composed of members of the public who hear evidence in secret. Prosecutors use them to gather evidence, as they can compel people to testify or hand over documentation. They consider whether evidence is strong enough to issue indictments for a criminal trial. The juries do not decide the innocence or guilt of a potential defendant. Prosecutors have for months been using a grand jury in the Eastern District of Virginia, which had issued some subpoenas in the case, reports say. This video can not be played All you need to know about the Trump-Russia investigation Mr Mueller has now opted for one of the several grand juries that sit in Washington, and reportedly began using it several weeks ago. Analysts say it shows Mr Mueller is taking full control of the investigation. He has already replaced most of the prosecutors originally on the case, in favour of his own legal minds. The switch from Virginia to Washington is also more practical. Mr Mueller's office will be closer and he knows the Washington federal courthouse better. As grand juries are secret, there will be no disclosure. Mr Mueller himself has given no details. It is clear Mr Mueller is investigating a meeting in June last year, in which Mr Trump's son, Donald Jr, and his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, met a Russian lawyer. Mr Trump Jr has admitted he was promised damaging material on Mr Trump's rival in the presidential race, Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton, though he says none was forthcoming. According to Reuters news agency, the special counsel is examining whether anyone affiliated with the Trump campaign encouraged the Russians to start releasing material about the Clinton campaign. Mr Mueller is reportedly seeking to determine whether Mr Trump knew of his son's meeting before it happened, or if he was briefed on it afterwards. US media have also quoted sources close to the investigation as saying that the special counsel is looking into whether President Trump obstructed justice when he fired FBI chief James Comey, who was leading the previous investigation into Russian interference. Mr Mueller was then appointed in May by the deputy attorney general of the Department of Justice to continue the inquiry. Mr Mueller is also reportedly investigating the financial dealings of former Trump campaign chief Paul Manafort as well as those of Michael Flynn, who Mr Trump sacked as national security adviser because he failed to disclose his Russian contacts. Mr Trump was his defiant self at a rally in Huntington, West Virginia, on Thursday evening. Donald Trump in West Virginia: ""We didn't win because of Russia, we won because of you"" Mr Trump said the allegations were a ""hoax"" that were ""demeaning to our country"". ""The Russia story is a total fabrication,"" he said. The crowd went wild as he continued: ""Most people know there were no Russians in our campaign. There never were. We didn't win because of Russia, we won because of you."" Ty Cobb, a lawyer appointed last month as White House special counsel, said he had been unaware a grand jury was being used. But he added: ""Grand jury matters are typically secret. The White House favours anything that accelerates the conclusion of [Mr Mueller's] work fairly. The White House is committed to fully co-operating with Mr Mueller."" Another Trump lawyer, John Dowd, told Associated Press: ""With respect to the news of the federal grand jury, I have no reason to believe that the president is under investigation."" Anthony Zurcher, BBC North America reporter Robert Mueller's special counsel investigation has always been a concern for the Trump administration. Now it's deadly serious business. With the news that a grand jury has been convened in Washington DC, and that it is looking into the June 2016 meeting between Donald Trump Jr and Russian nationals, it's clear the investigation is focusing on the president's inner circle. This news shouldn't come as a huge shock, given that Mr Mueller has been staffing up with veteran criminal prosecutors and investigators. It is, however, a necessary step that could eventually lead to criminal indictments. At the very least it's a sign that Mr Mueller could be on the trail of something big - expanding the scope beyond former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn and his questionable lobbying. It also indicates his investigation is not going to go away anytime soon.

"The Dukes of Hazzard star was arrested outside Boston on Wednesday night Dukes of Hazzard actor Tom Wopat has appeared in court to deny drug possession and groping a fellow cast member in a musical. Mr Wopat, 65, was freed on $1,000 (Â£760) bail and told to stay away from the woman whose buttocks he allegedly grabbed. The 65-year-old pleaded not guilty to indecent assault and battery and the drug charge. He was arrested in a Boston suburb on Wednesday night. According to court documents, Mr Wopat said he flirts but did ""nothing that could be considered inappropriate"". The 1980s TV star also told police he buys cocaine ""in large quantities and uses it over time"". Waltham, Massachusetts, police Det Sgt Tim King told the BBC: ""During an inventory search of Mr Wopat and his vehicle, two bags of white powder believed to be cocaine were discovered."" Mr Wopat was due to star in 42nd Street starting on Thursday, but the theatre announced that a different actor would play the role. Mr Wopat (right) played Luke Duke with fellow cast members John Schneider (L) as Bo Duke and Catherine Bach (M) as Daisy Duke Hours before he was to tread the boards, Mr Wopat's official Twitter feed posted an advert for the performance. It is due to run from 3-13 August at the Reagle Music Theater in Waltham. ""Don't miss your chance to see it!"" read the post, before it was deleted. Mr Wopat's movie credits in recent years include the Oscar-winning Quentin Tarantino film Django Unchained (2012).

"Sir James said: ""It is a disgrace... that a judge in 2017 should be faced with the problems thrown up by this case"" Society should be ""ashamed"" for not protecting a suicidal girl in secure custody, a senior judge has said. The president of Family Division of the High Court said there would be ""blood on our hands"" if the 17-year-old did not now receive adequate supervision. She is due to be released in 11 days, but a secure unit place has not yet been found for her - a situation Sir James Munby said was ""utterly shaming"". NHS sources later indicated that three possible beds had been found. Dr Mike Prentice, medical director for the NHS North Region, said: ""A number of options have now been identified, with detailed clinical and social assessments taking place tomorrow (Friday) to ensure the right package of care can be put in place before her release date."" The girl, identified only as ""X"", has tried to kill herself several times. Thejudgement,externalin the case of X - who is in the formal care of Cumbria County Council - revealed she was convicted at a youth court and has been detained in custody for almost six months. Sir James had previously noted the ""enormity of the task facing the local authority"" but stressed that the need for a final care plan was ""overwhelming"". During the latest hearing in July, he emphasised this need further, adding: ""On a large number of occasions... X has made determined attempts to commit suicide"". Staff at the unit where she is being held have said sending her back to her home town would be a ""suicide mission to a catastrophic level"". The judgement said: ""Staff do not think it will take more than 24 to 48 hours before they receive a phone call stating that X has made a successful attempt on her life."" An earlier ruling heard how unit staff had witnessed ""a profoundly disturbing and distressing scene when X self-harmed by repeatedly banging her head and face against the wall"". Staff have said she has to be checked every 50 seconds when she is in the shower. This video can not be played The case reflects a ""wholly unacceptable situation in our country"", says former health minister Norman Lamb Earlier, Simon Rowbotham, the solicitor for the legal guardian of the teenage girl, told the BBC that X has a ""determined wish"" to kill herself and lives in a stripped-down room and is restrained ""for hours on end"". By Mark Easton, home editor, BBC News The problem of providing suitable services for disturbed children and young people has been flagged up to ministers before. Two months ago, after complaints from police that cells were being used to accommodate youngsters who should have been in a mental health unit, the government introduced a law banning their use for such purposes. Doctors are warning there is still a critical shortage of appropriate care beds. A survey of child and adolescent mental health workers, conducted by the Royal College of Psychiatrists in 2015, found 62% had seen adolescent patients held in inappropriate settings, with 14% saying patients had attempted to kill themselves while waiting for a suitable bed. The prime minister has promised a ""revolution"" in mental health care, and the number of mental health staff in the NHS in England is rising by 21,000. But the agonies of a judge unable to help a suicidal young woman suggest the revolution still has some way to go. When X was younger, she ""was a child with poor school attendance, low-level criminality and periods of absconding"", a previous judgement said. In Sir James' judgement, delivered in private in the High Court family division sitting in Manchester, he said: ""If this is the best we can do for X, and others in similar crisis, what right do we, what right do the system, our society and indeed the State itself, have to call ourselves civilised? ""The honest answer to this question should make us all feel ashamed."" People stranded in mental health units 'We've travelled 8,000 miles to see our anorexic daughter' Mental health reforms to focus on young people - PM He went on: ""I feel shame and embarrassment; shame, as a human being, as a citizen and as an agent of the State, embarrassment as President of the Family Division, and, as such, Head of Family Justice, that I can do no more for X"". Liberal Democrat former health minister Norman Lamb told the BBC that the judgement reflected a ""wholly unacceptable situation in our country"". ""This is not a unique case, families are being let down routinely across our country and there is a moral imperative that we address this as a matter of real urgency,"" he said. By Philippa Roxby, health reporter, BBC News There are about 1,440 hospital beds for children and young people with mental health problems in the NHS in England. But a recent review found that they were not evenly spread across the country - for example, some areas had no in-patient beds within a 50-mile radius. The picture is also complicated by who those beds are for - some are in specialist units for children with eating disorders, others are in high dependency units for young people with complex needs. And there are many more specialist beds than high dependency ones. This means that children and their families often travel large distances to access in-patient treatment. NHS England says it wants to change this by increasing the number of beds in badly-served parts of the country and by offering crisis help to children and young people in the community, at an earlier stage. Mr Lamb said if investment was not made up front in the NHS, families would continue to be let down. ""The real problem is that the whole of the finances of the NHS are under such strain that the government's fine words about recruiting extra staff won't be delivered, because the money won't get through to mental health. ""Mental health always loses out whenever the money is tight and I fear that that will be the same again this time."" Earlier this week, Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt announced thatthousands more mental health workers were to be recruitedby the NHS in England. The government said an extra Â£1bn already promised for mental health services in England would fund the scheme - part of a pot of Â£1.3bn committed in 2016 to transform provision. The judge said copies of the ruling would be sent to the chief executive officer of NHS England Simon Stevens, Home Secretary Amber Rudd, Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt, Education Secretary Justine Greening and Justice Secretary David Lidington. Labour MP Luciana Berger, who previously served as shadow minister for mental health, tweeted that it was a ""devastating"" judgement, while Conservative MP and former children's minister Tim Loughton said it was ""worrying"".

Professor Wendy Burn, president of The Royal College of Psychiatrists, said some mental healthcare units were ""desperately short"" of suitable beds. She said the college urged the government in 2015 to prioritise investment in crisis care services for children and young people. It had also called on NHS England, clinical commissioning groups and social services to ensure emergency care pathways were in place. ""It's alarming to see that two years later, children are still not getting the support they need,"" Prof Burn said.

"Mark Carney: ""You really have to hold your nerve and keep the focus."" The governor of the Bank of England has said the banking sector could double in size but still needs tough regulation. Mark Carney told the Guardian the financial sector could be worth 20 times the UK's economic output in 25 years. He said: ""If the UK financial system thrives in a post-Brexit world... it will be 15 to 20 times GDP in another quarter of century. ""Well then you really have to hold your nerve and keep the focus."" Carney was speaking to the Guardian to mark the 10th anniversary of the start of the global financial crisis in August 2007. He said the UK could not return to the pre-crisis light-touch regulation in order to attract business after leaving the EU. The governor has previously said the UK after Brexit could be the ""investment banker for Europe"". He said: ""We have a financial system that is [now] ten times the size of this economyâ¦ It brings many strengths, it brings a million jobs, it pays 11% of tax revenue, it is the biggest export industry by some tokenâ¦ all good things. ""But it's risky."" ""We have a viewâ¦ that post-Brexit the level of regulation will be at least as high as it currently is and that's a level that in many cases substantially exceeds international norms. ""The problem you have is that the same issues re-emerge under different labelsâ¦ and the progress that's been madeâ¦ is gradually chipped away."" Mr Carney's comments come as US regulators begin formal proceedings to loosen regulations brought in after the financial crisis to curb the way banks took high-risk bets on the financial markets.

"US President Donald Trump urged the Mexican president to stop publicly saying he would not pay for a proposed border wall, according to transcripts. Mr Trump admonished Enrique Pena Nieto for publicly denouncing the wall during a 27 January phone call, transcripts obtained by the Washington Post show. ""You cannot say that to the press,"" he reportedly told him. Transcripts of his first call with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull were also published. In a rancorous call, President Trump tells him it was the ""worst"" conversation he had that day, and one with Russian President Vladimir Putin was more pleasant. What Trump really meant in those phone calls Mr Trump launched his presidential campaign on a promise to build a wall along the US southern border and vowed to make Mexico pay for the project. But the transcripts show the US president acknowledged the funding would come from other sources, saying the money ""will work out in the formula somehow"". He added: ""If you are going to say that Mexico is not going to pay for the wall then I do not want to meet with you guys anymore because I cannot live with that."" Six things that could topple Trump's wall Australian PM mocks Trump in leaked audioWho is going to pay for The House of Representatives approved $1.6 billion towards the border wall last week, and the federal government has been viewing proposals submitted by construction contractors. Speaker of the House Paul Ryan, the highest ranked congressional Republican, also released a video this week of his visit to the southern border, saying ""it's time for The Wall"". Here are some key quotes, with analysis by the BBC's Anthony Zurcher. TRUMP:""I won New Hampshire because New Hampshire is a drug-infested den."" AZ:Donald Trump lost New Hampshire in the general election, but he won its Republican primary last February, which cemented his status as the front-runner for the party's nomination. While he was campaigning there he acknowledged the state's opioid addiction epidemic, but never in such derogatory terms. TRUMP:""You have some pretty tough hombres in Mexico that you may need help with, and we are willing to help you with that big-league. But they have to be knocked out and you have not done a good job of knocking them out."" AZ:The ""tough hombre"" line had leaked - and been roundly derided as insensitive - shortly after the president had his conversation with Mr Pena Nieto. Now it can be viewed in context, which doesn't do much to help the president appear diplomatic. TRUMP:""Your words are so beautiful. Those are beautiful words and I do not think I can speak that beautifully, okay? It would be great to put those words at the end of the statement."" AZ:During the campaign, Mr Trump once boasted: ""I know the best words."" Perhaps the president is acknowledging that, in Mr Pena Nieto, he's finally met his match. Trump speaks on the phone with Turnbull in the White House Oval Office TRUMP:""This [refugee resettlement deal] is going to kill me. I am the world's greatest person that does not want to let people into the country."" AZ:Mr Trump apparently walked into his phone call with Mr Turnbull with no clear understanding of the details of the refugee resettlement agreement, aside from what ""somebody"" told him the day before. TRUMP:""I guarantee you they [refugees] are bad. That is why they are in prison right now. They are not going to be wonderful people who go on to work for the local milk people."" AZ:The refugees in question were being detained, not imprisoned - a key difference. And, as Mr Turnbull points out, the US did not agree to admit all 1,250 individuals, but rather to screen them and then admit only those who would pose no threat to the ""milk people"". TRUMP:""I have had it. I have been making these calls all day and this is the most unpleasant call all day. Putin was a pleasant call. This is ridiculous."" AZ:There were news reports after the conversation that Mr Trump's interactions with Mr Turnbull were less than cordial. The president and the White House denied it, but the transcript tells a different story. The line about Vladimir Putin is just the icing on the cake. Republicans on building wall.

"Marcus Hutchins wanted to remain anonymous after the WannaCry outbreak, but his identity was revealed British cyber-security researcher Marcus Hutchins will appear in court in Las Vegas later charged in a US cyber-crime case. The 23-year-old has been accused of involvement with Kronos - a piece of malware used to steal banking logins from victims' computers. Mr Hutchins, from Ilfracombe in Devon, came to prominence after he stalled the WannaCry cyber-attack which hit the NHS in May. The FBI arrested him on Wednesday. The UK's National Cyber Security Centre has said it was aware of the situation with fellow cyber-security researchers expressing surprise at the indictment. WannaCry spread rapidly through computer systems around the world, in an unprecedented outbreak that began on 12 May. Shortly afterwards, Mr Hutchins was thrust into the limelight after he found a way to stop it from spreading. He had been in Las Vegas attending the Black Hat and Def Con cyber-security conferences, but activity on his Twitter feed - usually highly active - ceased two days ago. ""Marcus Hutchins... a citizen and resident of the United Kingdom, was arrested in the United States on 2 August, 2017, in Las Vegas, Nevada, after a grand jury in the Eastern District of Wisconsin returned a six-count indictment against Hutchins for his role in creating and distributing the Kronos banking Trojan,"" the US Department of Justice (DoJ) said in a statement. ""The charges against Hutchins, and for which he was arrested, relate to alleged conduct that occurred between in or around July 2014 and July 2015."" It is not known where Mr Hutchins is being held in custody. Kronos is malware that is designed to steal banking login and other financial data from infected computers. The DoJ's indictment is dated 12 July, before Mr Hutchins arrived in the US. It alleges that he created and sold Kronos on internet forums, including the AlphaBay dark web market,which was recently shut downafter an international law enforcement operation. His mother, Janet Hutchins, said it was ""hugely unlikely"" that her son was involved, saying he had spent ""enormous amounts of time and even his free time"" stopping attacks like these. A second defendant is also included in the indictment, but their name has not been made public. Mr Hutchins tweeted about Kronos shortly after it was reported in the press: ""Anyone got a Kronos sample?"" he wrote. Mr Hutchins tweets under the pseudonym 'MalwareTech' People, who work with Mr Hutchins investigating malware, have said ""it looks like the US justice system has made a huge mistake"". He was arrested while at an airport, his colleagues say, and has not been allowed visitors. Digital rights groups have said they are ""deeply concerned"" by Mr Hutchin's situation. A spokesman for the UK's National Cyber Security Centre said: ""This is a law enforcement matter and it would be inappropriate to comment further."" The DoJ has said Mr Hutchins' case was investigated by the FBI's cyber-crime unit in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. The British Consulate in Los Angeles said it is in contact with the local authorities in Las Vegas and was providing support to his family. The AlphaBay dark web market went offline earlier this month US cyber-attorney Tor Ekeland said Mr Hutchins could face ""40 years in jail"" if found guilty but admitted the case had not named any victims. Speaking on Radio 4's Today, he said alleging that writing software of this type is potentially illegal is ""highly problematic"" for the information security industry. ""I can think of a number of examples of legitimate software that would potentially be a felony under this theory of prosecution."" This video can not be played Marcus Hutchins could face ""decades in jail"", computer-crime attorney Tor Ekeland tells Radio 4's Today Kronos is a type of malware known as a Trojan, meaning it disguises itself as legitimate software. It is thought to be named after a mythological creature. Kronos first came tolight in July 2014,external, when it was advertised on a Russian underground forum for $7,000 (Â£5,330) - a relatively high figure at the time. It was marketed as way to steal logins for banking websites and other financial data. Its vendor boasted it could evade existing anti-virus software and said it worked with the latest versions of Internet Explorer, Firefox and Chrome web browsers. In an unusual step, the developer promised free upgrades and bug fixes and the option of a $1,000 one week trial. After much publicity it faded from view until October 2015, whenIBM researchers reported,externalthat Kronos had been spotted in attacks on UK and Indian bank websites. Kronos then struck again in May 2016, when the cyber-security firm Proofpoint reported it had been used to target customers ofCanadian financial institutions,external. In November Proofpoint reported it hadspotted the Trojan being,externaldistributed via emails sent to organisations involved in the financial services, hospitality, higher education and healthcare industries. The messages contained attachments and links that claimed to be related to Microsoft Sharepoint documents, but in fact led victims' computers to be infected with other malware, including a credit card number-stealing tool.

"Pistorius was a global sporting icon before his conviction for the murder of his girlfriend Jailed former Olympian Oscar Pistorius has been taken to hospital, authorities have confirmed. Pistorius was jailed for six years in 2016 for murdering his girlfriend, Reeva Steenkamp. An official statement confirmed that Pistorius ""was this morning taken to an outside hospital establishment for medical examination"". Details of Pistorius' condition were not released, but he is expected to remain in hospital overnight. A spokesman for South Africa's correctional services told broadcaster SABC that there was ""nothing out of the ordinary"" in Pistorius' hospitalisation. The corrections service also played down earlier media reports that Pistorius had been suffering from ""chest pains"". ""I am not aware of [that report] or what he suffered from,"" a spokesman told Reuters news agency. The making and unmaking of Oscar Pistorius Has Pistorius got off lightly? Oscar Pistorius trial: 10 key moments Pistorius has previously received hospital treatment in August 2016,after slipping in his cell and injuring his wrists. The former athlete quickly rose to fame in the Paralympics, and made headlines when he became the first track and field athlete to compete in both the Paralympic and Olympic Games - racing against non-disabled athletes. But in February 2013, he shot and killed Reeva Steenkamp at his home, alleging that he had mistaken her for an intruder. His trial became the subject of widespread international attention, as he was initially cleared of murder in favour of a manslaughter charge - then convicted of murder on appeal in 2016.

" There was nothing quite like it. Before that there were physique magazines - pictures of people in gymnasiums doing muscle exercises. But they weren't gay magazines.” Then, in 1969, a breakthrough. Jeremy arrived. Tim Hughes, who worked as a writer at its Carnaby Street office in London, still has copies of Jeremy from that groundbreaking period. Tim Hughes He picks one out. The masthead is pink and a slogan says: “Gay gay power to the gay gay people!” In those days “gay power” was not a widely known term. “I think this was probably the first time it appeared in England on the front of any magazine or newspaper,” Tim says. Tim as a young man Flicking through, there's a feature on “queer” kings of England, a gay horoscope and a piece about gay skinheads. “It was an attempt to provide the gay world with a magazine of its own.” Horoscope page Newsagents wouldn't stock it. So it was subscription only and money was often tight. “We invented this thing called Jeremy Fundies,” he recalls. They were briefs bought in bulk and then sold via mail order to make money for the magazine. It was very much a Y-front world. People had never thought about being able to wear things like that.” But it was the death in London in June 1969 of the singer and Wizard of Oz actress Judy Garland that secured Jeremy's place in musical history. “One day we got this phone call from the manager of a young singer who'd been very affected by the way the gay community had turned out a few months before at Judy Garland's death,” says Tim. “The manager wanted to promote this person to the gay community.” The singer was David Bowie. The magazine's writers spent two weeks hanging out with him. Bowie was not yet a legend but his career was taking off, with the release of his first hit single, Space Oddity. In the subsequent profile that Tim wrote with a colleague, Bowie is quoted saying: “I'm a loner, I don't feel the need for conventional relationships.” The piece marked an important first step in Bowie's sexual identity. This was the first article I think where he intimated that he might be bisexual.” Today, with the magazine's seminal legacy safe, one mystery remains. “I don't know why it was called Jeremy,” says Tim. His guess: “It's a bit camp - a camp boys name.” Tim and the other contributors feature in BBC Four'sPrejudice and Pride:The People's History of LGBTQ Britain. Books can change people's lives - especially banned books. Gill Williamson in Glasgow treasures a novel that helped her through the late 1960s. The Well of Loneliness by Radclyffe Hall had been published in 1928 and was banned soon after. It was a simple lesbian love story involving two women who struggle to cope with society's harsh judgment. Gill Williamson as a young woman At the time, the editor of the Sunday Express said that he would rather give a child prussic acid (hydrogen cyanide) than let them read the novel. “Poison kills the body but moral poison kills the soul,” he wrote. By the time Gill discovered it, the novel had cult status among gay women. Being a lesbian was never illegal but they were virtually invisible in public life at the time. The novel made her feel less alone. It was one of the first novels I read that contained a story about lesbians. And the main character comes across as being a bit of a tomboy, and that was similar to myself.” Gill Williamson Gill's other significant object from that era is a letter from her mother. Gill had just come out to her mother and moved to Aberdeen with her lover. Her mother is sympathetic and supportive but what she writes is also telling: “I wonder if it was something I did wrong in your childhood to make you feel that way.” And just before signing off with love, she adds: It is best you never let Dad know as it goes against all his principles. I think he would disown you.” Carol Steele felt like a girl in a boy's body. It was the 1950s and there was no-one to tell. Carol Steele as a child She remembers her father reading from the newspaper about a transgender person: “I was lying on the floor reading a comic and my ears pricked up - there was somebody else like me out there.” And then at the end of the story my father turned to my mum and said 'perverts like that should be locked in a loony bin and the key thrown away'.” Carol Steele By the 1970s Carol had been prescribed hormones to become a woman. Her body was changing. She had landed her dream job as a research scientist. But the company medical triggered a summons from her boss. “He said, 'We've heard back from the medical report and we will not allow anything like that to happen in this company,'” Carol recalls. A cleaner at the firm arranged for the union to go out on strike in solidarity. But Carol decided against going public. “I didn't want to be recognised and ill-treated on the streets. In the end I said, 'Thank you so much but no, I'm going to disappear and start my new life.'” In 1975 came an important landmark. Carol received a passport in her new name. She remains deeply fond of that dark blue UK passport. That for me is one of my favourite relics from the past. I was formally recognised as me, as being female.” She still has a photograph of herself on a beach in Biarritz six months later - a woman on holiday, no longer a person trapped in the wrong body. Finally, in 2004 the law changed to allow trans people to amend their birth certificates. The next year Carol received hers in the post. In the column for sex it said 'Girl'. I just sat there on the bed and sobbed my heart out. It was the final piece in the jigsaw.” They look like ordinary legal documents, but for Sandi Hughes they marked the end of her family life, the loss of her four children and the beginning of a new life as a lesbian. Growing up in Liverpool in the post-war decades, Sandi would read True Romance magazine. Sandi Hughes “It was about a man and a woman falling in love, living happily ever after. So I was looking for that kind of lifestyle,” she says. Sandi married the first man who said he loved her. They had four children together in five years. He was a sailor and away at sea most of the time. “So I was like a single parent. But I loved it.” A snap of Sandi's children when they were young After six years he came out of the navy and they began living together. I loved my kids but I was really aware of not being happy.” Sandi was faced with an agonising choice. Spend the rest of her life being someone she wasn't, or try to be true to herself as a lesbian. Divorce proceedings began. “This is the court case for custody,” she says leafing through documents. “And it was all built around me being gay.” She was asked to make a terrible choice. The judge said you won't have custody of your daughters because you're a lesbian and unfit to be a mother to them. But you can have custody of your son.” She was shocked. “I felt a bit of a cold sweat come over me and thought wow I must be really bad if I can't have my daughters. And I remember thinking there and then, how can I separate them, how can I take the boy out of the family?” She couldn't split the family up. It was time to say goodbye. I knelt down until I was their height and gave them all a hug. I had a really heavy pain in my chest - that must have been my heart.” Sandi moved to a bedsit and tried to rebuild her life. She got a camera and began documenting her new life. She made friends in the gay community. One of them was an aspiring performer - a young, out and proud Holly Johnson, who became lead vocalist with the 80s band Frankie Goes to Hollywood. Sandi's old friends - including Holly Johnson (r) “Back in those days it wasn't about falling in love and settling down happily ever after. It was about telling each other our stories, how we came out, who we were, what we expected. It was like we were all new and fresh at being gay.” Eventually she became part of her children's lives again. It was a theatre, a social centre, a church. A place to go to be sad, a place to escape the tyranny of work. Coming here you realised there was a community. People were out and proud. I always felt I'd come home.” Martyn Butler Martyn Butler is talking about Heaven, the legendary gay club in London's Charing Cross. He was one of the lucky few to have a Heaven Gold card. Martyn's Heaven Gold card Queen's frontman Freddie Mercury, and the comedian and broadcaster Kenny Everett, were also said to have one. Heaven gave Martyn a place where he could feel normal. 1980s at Heaven I was a young gay boy, 16, from South Wales. I was only really happy when I suddenly found myself among 2,000 people.” Part of that, he thinks is from being deaf. “Coming into a nightclub everybody is equal. The sound is so loud that you have to shout.” Martyn went on to become head of lasers, creating spectacular light shows for the clubbers. He still has his crew T-shirt and is proud of his time at Heaven. We'd come from a very, very dark period. Don't tell anyone, be afraid of the police. And by 1982 we had our own music, there was already a sense that we were taking control.” “We knew from our first kiss that we would always be together,” says Susan Douglas Scott. But for most of their lives there was no way for gay people to make a legally binding, public commitment to one another. The Civil Partnership Act in 2005 changed all that. Susan and Gerrie Douglas Scott “We had already made our vows to each other about 10 years before on a little boat in Perthshire,” says Gerrie Douglas Scott, Susan's partner. But for us to make that public statement with all our friends and family around about us was very important.” In 2014, after gay marriage became legal, Susan and Gerrie were the first women in Scotland to marry. First minister Nicola Sturgeon was a witness. It has been a stunning turnaround in gay rights, says Susan: For those two changes to have come within a decade - it's just amazing.” Susan and Gerrie on their wedding day They were colourful and punchy: “Heterosexuality Breeds”, “Liberated Men Are More Fun”, “Gay Liberation Front”. A badge was a mini manifesto. The message was pinned to your jacket. “Gay liberation was accessible,” says Angela Cooper, a student in Manchester during the 1970s. “Anyone could put on a badge and become part of the gay liberation movement.” It was about being visible and political. The GLF was in favour of not just gay rights but tearing down the system and starting again. It saw a link between capitalism, social division and repression. “The first requirement of the Gay Liberation Front was coming out,” recalls GLF activist Stuart Feather. “So you put this badge on, you'd be on the tube and people would say 'what's the Gay Liberation Front?'” And the conversation would begin. Georgie Long and Frankie O'Reilly The doctor sat us down. He said: 'The two of you should go home, put your affairs in order and enjoy whatever time you have left. You've both got the Aids virus.'” Frankie O'Reilly and his partner Georgie Long were 25 years old. They had met at primary school in Northern Ireland and been inseparable ever since. It was the 1980s and HIV - the virus which can lead to Aids - was a terrifying new phenomenon. “People started dying who were diagnosed after us,” Frankie recalls. “The fear set in.” One day they were at Ikea looking at blinds. Georgie suddenly started having a seizure. For the next six months he had 40 or 50 seizures a day. Near the end, Georgie was interviewed about living with Aids. “You can make yourself a prisoner within yourself,” he said. “I should have been talking to other people. Everybody's in the same boat. There's nothing to be frightened of, there are people out there who care.” Georgie being interviewed shortly before his death Georgie died on 26 October 1992. Just before Christmas that same year, a grief-stricken Frankie enrolled on a course at the London Lighthouse, an Aids hospice. He wanted to make a section of the UK's Aids Memorial Quilt. The idea had started in the US and was now taking off here. People took a piece of fabric and sewed a panel for a loved one who'd died. Each panel was then added to others to make a huge patchwork quilt of memories. Frankie made a striking design in red, black and white. I'm really glad I made it, as 25 years later it's still there.” It gives the dates of Georgie's birth and death, where he grew up - “Derry” - and three photographs. There's one photo of him as a young boy. We rarely think of gay men before they were adults. It's to remind people that he was once someone's baby.” (Getty Images) Underneath the photos there's a picture Georgie drew in his final year - a hand holding a crystal ball. In 1994, Frankie saw the 384 panels which made up the UK quilt - they were laid out in full at London's Hyde Park and covered nearly 7,000 square feet. For a decade the panels were stored in a garage in North East England, but they are now kept in a storage unit in the South East. Sections of the UK Aids quilt in St Paul's Cathedral, London(Getty Images) Last year some of the quilt sections, including Georgie's, were exhibited in St Paul's Cathedral for World AIDS Day. “I found it more powerful this time,” Frankie says. “In the late 80s we went through that awful period when everyone was dying.” Frankie For 12 years it was nursing people and carrying coffins. Just over 30 years later we've now come through that. And I'm still here.” Louise Carolin puts the tape in the cassette player. She presses play and suddenly it is 20 February 1988 again. The sound of people chanting, cheering, whistles. Then her commentary: “Under the bridge now, we're running... There are some really nice people up on a balcony clapping and cheering... People are dancing in the streets here, the police are looking on.” The 1988 Manchester demonstration against Clause 28 Louise was 21 at the time. She had travelled up to Manchester with a friend. They were at a mass demonstration against Clause 28, later known as Section 28. It is a notorious chapter in LGBTQ history. Section 28 was the Thatcher government's attempt to ban “the promotion of homosexuality”, a backlash against gay rights. The legislation followed tabloid outrage over a book called Jenny Lives with Eric and Martin, which told the tale of a little girl growing up with her dad and his gay lover. “It was really personal because that legislation was about protecting children,” Louise recalls. This idea that we were somehow a threat to the children... it was so toxic.” Louise Carolin's old union cards But the legislation had an unintended consequence. Although we were angry, although we felt threatened, Section 28 actually brought a community together and kind of galvanised people.” Louise Carolin Louise made the tape of the demonstration because she was writing for Shocking Pink, the lesbian magazine for young women. She still has a copy of her article. It quotes actress Sue Johnston, famous at the time for playing Sheila Grant in Brookside and more recently for her role as Barbara in the sitcom the Royle Family. Johnston told the crowd: “When I first heard about Clause 28, I thought about Hitler's burning of the books and we all know what happened over there, and it must not happen over here!” Louise's Shocking Pink article reports that the crowd responded, “with roars of 'SHEILA, SHEILA, SHEILA!'” Sue Johnston in the magazine - Shocking Pink Six years later Brookside would go on to make history, by screening the first pre-watershed lesbian kiss on UK television. That demonstration gave everyone hope, Louise recalls. We were so hungry for affirmation. For people to say this was wrong.” It was six o'clock in the morning when they came for Emma Riley. I was asleep. There was a knock on the door. They came in and they said get up, get downstairs, you're under arrest.” And then they went through all her possessions. A colleague had told the Royal Navy police that Emma was a lesbian. They took her letters, they took Suede's debut album - it shows two women kissing on the cover - and her video of comedian Julian Clary. “Because, of course, if you have a Julian Clary video you must be gay,” she says wryly. Emma Riley Up until 2000, servicemen and women could be arrested and court-martialled for being lesbian or gay. Emma joined the navy in 1990 and was drafted to HMS Cornwall as a radio operator, part of the first batch of women to be on the ship. She says she was seen as officer material. I very much enjoyed the work and I was good at it.” But three years later her secret was out. Like hundreds of other personnel each year during the 1980s, she was thrown out of the armed forces because of her sexuality. Her service papers give the bland official version: 26 Nov 93 DISCHARGE SHORE Emma's discharge sheet And below that a stamp: TERMINAL BENEFITS AWARDED Not only was she out of a job she loved, she had to come out to her parents. “I was so terrified of how they were going to feel about it, how disappointed they were going to be.” But in the end her anxiety was misplaced: They were brilliant. I'm extremely lucky to have the parents I have. They said 'Don't worry, we love you'.” Emma in uniform with her parents “My friend Tina said they were like wearing little clouds on your feet in heaven.” Jennifer Black Jennifer Black is wearing the Ugg boots she bought exactly four years ago - on the day she transitioned to being a woman.

"Trump calls Turnbull but the conversation doesn't go well Deconstructing a Donald Trump verbatim transcript has become the hottest new pastime in Washington, DC. Just days after being treated to a veritable treasure trove of strange presidential assertions and non sequiturs in a previously unreleased Wall Street Journal interview, the public has been offered a blast from the (recent) past in leaked records of Mr Trump's phone conversations with Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto and Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull. The conversations took place on the same day in January, in the US president's first week in office, during a marathon session of phone calls to world leaders. It gives an inside view into how Mr Trump talks when he doesn't think the public is listening (hint: it's not much different from his public performances). Here are some highlights. TRUMP:""Well, Canada is no problem - do not worry about Canada, do not even think about them. That is a separate thing and they are fine and we have had a very fair relationship with Canada. It has been much more balanced and much more fair. So we do not have to worry about Canada, we do not even think about them."" AZ:This could be an example of the Trump administration's seeming preference for bilateral trade negotiations, rather than multi-party agreements like Nafta. While the president professed to have ""no problem"" with Canada, since his conversation with Mr Pena Nieto, Mr Trump has been quite critical of his northern neighbour, blasting the nation's policies on dairy and soft lumber exports. TRUMP:""I won New Hampshire because New Hampshire is a drug-infested den."" AZ:Donald Trump lost New Hampshire in the general election, but he won its Republican primary last February, which cemented his status as the front-runner for the party's nomination. While he was campaigning there he acknowledged the state's opioid addiction epidemic, but never in such derogatory terms. TRUMP:""You have some pretty tough hombres in Mexico that you may need help with, and we are willing to help you with that big-league. But they have to be knocked out and you have not done a good job of knocking them out."" Trump and Pena Nieto have had some awkward exchanges AZ:The ""tough hombre"" line had leaked - and been roundly derided as insensitive - shortly after the president had his conversation with Mr Nieto. Now it can be viewed in context, which doesn't do much to help the president appear diplomatic. TRUMP:""If you are going to say that Mexico is not going to pay for the wall, then I do not want to meet with you guys anymore because I cannot live with that,"" he said. ""You cannot say that to the press"". AZ:One of Mr Trump's key campaign promises runs up against a cold hard reality critics had pointed out from the very beginning. Mexico just isn't going to pay for the border wall. The president seems to recognise his predicament and the public relations fiasco that could result. His solution? Trying to convince Mr Pena Nieto to stop talking about it to the press. TRUMP:""It is you and I against the world, Enrique, do not forget."" AZ:Well, this is a strange sentiment given that Mexico - and undocumented Mexican immigrants - were a regular punching bag for Mr Trump for much of his presidential campaign. Mr Pena Nieto's flattery throughout the conversation seems to have softened the president's attitude, at least for the moment. TRUMP:""Your words are so beautiful. Those are beautiful words and I do not think I can speak that beautifully, okay? It would be great to put those words at the end of the statement."" AZ:During the campaign, Mr Trump once boasted: ""I know the best words."" Perhaps the president is acknowledging that, in Mr Pena Nieto, he's finally met his match. TRUMP:""This [refugee resettlement deal] is going to kill me. I am the world's greatest person that does not want to let people into the country."" AZ:Mr Trump apparently walked into his phone call with Mr Turnbull with no clear understanding of the details of the refugee resettlement agreement, aside from what ""somebody"" told him the day before. TRUMP:""I guarantee you they [refugees] are bad. That is why they are in prison right now. They are not going to be wonderful people who go on to work for the local milk people."" AZ:The refugees in question were being detained, not imprisoned - a key difference. And, as Mr Turnbull points out, the US did not agree to admit all 1,250 individuals, but rather to screen them and then admit only those who would pose no threat to the ""milk people"". Australian PM mocks Trump in leaked audioWho is going to pay for 'I wasn't exactly mocking you, Donald' TRUMP:""That is why they lost the election, because of stupid deals like this. You have brokered many a stupid deal in business and I respect you, but I guarantee that you broke many a stupid deal. This is a stupid deal."" AZ:One seldom has to wait for long for Mr Trump to bring up the 2016 presidential election, whether it's in a phone call with a foreign leader, a White House event for a championship sports team or a speech to a Boy Scout jubilee. That - and the art of successful deal-making - are the president's two favourite topics of discussion. Mr Turnbull gets a two-for-one special. TRUMP:""What is the thing with boats? Why do you discriminate against boats?"" AZ:One of the things Mr Trump doesn't seem to understand is why Australia will not grant asylum to anyone who arrives on its soil by seagoing vessel. As Mr Turnbull tries to explain, the reason is to discourage human traffickers and make the dangerous water voyage less appealing to refugees. It has nothing to do with the country of origin of the refugees or the perceived risk associated with granting them residency. TRUMP:""I have had it. I have been making these calls all day and this is the most unpleasant call all day. Putin was a pleasant call. This is ridiculous."" AZ:There were news reports after the conversation that Mr Trump's interactions with Mr Turnbull were less than cordial. The president and the White House denied it, but the transcript tells a different story. The line about Vladimir Putin is just the icing on the cake.

"Paris-St Germain have completed their deal to sign Neymar from Barcelona for 222m euros (Â£198m). Some people, including Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp, questioned how this transfer could be allowed under European football's governing bodyUefa's Financial Fair Play (FFP) rules.,external Remember, the Â£198m is only the initial outlay - PSG will also have to pay the Brazilian star that amount in wages over a five-year contract, as well as hefty fees to his father who is his agent and insurance premiums to protect their investment. Barcelona presidentJosep Maria Bartomeu had threatened to report PSG to Uefafor breaching FFP rules. But Uefadoes not have the power to block the deal.In a statement, it told the BBC: ""We are not in a position to stop clubs from buying players, but the clubs will face sanctions if they fail to abide by Financial Fair Play rules."" Uefa introduced break-even FFP rules in 2013 to stop clubs accumulating too much debt and to prevent wealthy owners from injecting too much cash into their clubs. The rules state that over a three-year period a club like PSG, which is owned by the Gulf state of Qatar via its Oryx Qatar Sports Investments fund, can spend 30m euros more than it earns. It is possible that PSG has accumulated lots of profits over the past two years to make it easier for them to make such a big outlay in the current year. Uefa allows spending on things like stadiums, youth development and women's teams to be excluded from the calculations. Barcelona was given the whole transfer fee up front, but that does not mean it has to all be accounted for in the current year. ""For FFP accounting purposes, the transfer fee will be divided over the length of the player's contract,"" says Daniel Geey, a sports lawyer at Sheridans. ""So if it's a five-year deal, that will count as around Â£40m of transfer spending per year."" But Â£40m a year plus wages is still a hefty outlay, so how might PSG balance the books? There has been much talk of the club recouping the outlay by selling lots of Neymar shirts, but Mr Geey is not optimistic. ""It's a complete misnomer that clubs make a fortune from shirt sales increasing after big transfers,"" he says. Kit deals tend to involve a big outlay up front with only limited profit-sharing of 10% to 15% after a certain number of shirts have been sold, he explains, so many millions of extra shirts would have to be sold to make serious inroads into the extra spending. Of course, it may mean the club receives more money from Nike when it comes to renegotiate, but its current deal runs until 2022. PSG is presumably confident that such a high-profile player will help it to sign other commercial deals and there is no limit to the number of official products they could have. We do not know what deal has been struck over Neymar's image rights, but if PSG can get a proportion of those it will help with meeting the FFP rules. Then there is money to be earned on the pitch. PSG is already making a considerable amount of money in the Champions League - in the last five years it has reached the quarter-finals four times and been knocked out in the round of 16 once. Last year, a team getting to the semi-final was paid an extra 7.5m euros (Â£6.7m), the losing finalists earned 11m euros (Â£9.9m) and the winner 15.5m euros (Â£14m). And that's just prize money, there are other pots of cash distributed to successful teams. The club came second in the French league last year but had won the title for the previous four years so there is not much scope for extra prize money there. They may argue that their huge acquisition will make French football more popular and lead to more lucrative television deals from around the world, but that would be a big impact for a single player, although it might help them sell expensive hospitality packages at their stadium the Parc des Princes. Of course, PSG could always balance the books by selling a few of their existing players, but losing them would not help their Champions' League ambitions. PSG fell foul of the FFP rules in 2014 when Uefa ruled that a Â£167m commercial contract with the Qatar Tourism Authority was unfairly generous - effectively, the governing body ruled that Qatar had been using the contract to bypass the FFP rules. They were given a Â£20m fine, their spending was capped at Â£49m and they competed in the 2014-15 Champions League with 21 players in their squad instead of the usual 25.

"The big squeeze on incomes will get tighter from here and will last longer than previously thought. At the moment, prices are rising 2.6% while wages are rising just 2%. That gap is expected to widen later this year. Inflation is expected to peak at around 3% in October, as the surge in import prices caused by the post-Brexit-referendum drop in the pound continues to feed through to shop prices. When prices rise faster than wages, we get poorer on average every day. This explains why the Bank cut its forecast for economic growth for this year and next. It is also the main reason why the Bank of England has decided - for the 120th month in a row - not to raise interest rates. The Bank of England is faced with a delicate balancing act: keeping inflation under control - that means near its target of 2% - while trying not to damage the economy. Under normal circumstances, faced with inflation above target and rising while unemployment is at its lowest level in over 40 years, the bank would already be raising interest rates. But the consumers that power three-quarters of the economic growth are already under pressure as their incomes are eroded by inflation. To put further pressure on them by increasing the cost of borrowing is seen as too much of a risk - for six of the eight rate setters. Of course, one way to keep up living standards while your spending power is dwindling is to borrow money to top it up. Consumers have been doing exactly that - piling on extra debt at a rate the Bank of England thinks is worrying. Consumer credit (personal loans, credit cards, overdrafts, etc) has risen by 10% in the last year alone - far outstripping the growth in wages or the economy. Just last week, one of the bank's top officials accused lenders of a ""spiral of complacency"" in dishing out this credit. The irony is that some of this money has come courtesy of the Bank of England, which lent the High Street banks Â£100bn in super-cheap money last August to combat the perceived risks to the economy of the EU referendum vote. The Bank confirmed today they had authorisation from the chancellor to increase that pot to Â£115bn. That flow of money will be shut down in February next year - as originally planned - but the increase to the pot sends mixed messages. On the one hand, the Bank is worried that consumers are getting deeper into debt while at the same time increasing High Street banks' ability to offer irresistibly low borrowing rates. It's a contradiction that perhaps shows just how tough this delicate this balancing act can be. The good news is the big squeeze won't last forever. According to the Bank, wages will begin to rise faster than inflation in the second half of next year. The bad news for borrowers - and good for savers - is that is the moment when rates finally begin to rise.

"The four tower blocks in the Chalcots estate are covered in the same cladding as Grenfell Almost six weeks ago, in the wake of the devastating Grenfell Tower blaze, fire safety concerns prompted the evacuation of 3,000 people - with little notice - from their homes in four tower blocks on another London estate. Many residents were angry then and they are fearful now - worried that the ""urgent"" works they were moved out for have been rushed and shoddily done. More than 700 flats on the Chalcots estate in north-west London were emptied, with families housed first on air beds in a nearby leisure centre and later in hotels. Residents in all but two flats have now moved back in but the situation looks far from resolved. David lives at the top of a tower on the Swiss Cottage development and has a list of issues with the state of the building. His block, Taplow, and three others on the estate are clad in the same combustible material used at Grenfell Tower. At the time of the evacuations Camden Council, which owns the blocks, said improvements were needed to the internal, communal areas of the towers. The council says the urgent works have now been signed off but David (not his real name) believes the work is incomplete. Filming on the estate was not allowed but photographs taken by the BBC illustrate some of his concerns. David's worries start with his front door and the mechanism, called a closer, which is designed to automatically pull the door shut. It is a key factor because people faced with a fire often flee without remembering to close doors behind them. The one fitted to David's front door has already broken, and if a fire was to happen a door left open would do nothing to stop fire spilling out from inside the flat to the corridor. David points out a succession of other problems, including a sizeable gap at the bottom of his neighbour's front door. A secure front door is a key barrier to keeping fires contained for as long as possible - but David demonstrates how quickly he fears flames will be able to get past this particular barrier. ""I can get my entire hand under the front door and if your hand was a fire it'd be out in seconds,"" he says, kneeling down to demonstrate his point. Non-slip strips in the fire escape stairwell - in place so that residents can see each step - are worn and barely visible even in daylight. ""Imagine what they'd be like when the lights are off - they are clearly not fit for purpose,"" David says. Safety strips should be visible across these fire escape steps Camden Council has reassured residents that fire marshals will be seated on each floor, 24 hours a day, to ensure their safety. But David claims they have not had the correct training. ""They themselves have told us they have none,"" David said. ""A lot of them are standard security guys who have come from agencies and have been told to put on an orange apron and double up as a fire marshal. ""None have training whatsoever,"" he says. His concerns are echoed by independent surveyor and fire safety expert Arnold Tarling. ""From what I have seen in one flat in Taplow and in the common parts, the building is not safe,"" he said. David says he has been unable to get a straight answer from the council. ""I've written to the council on numerous occasions, and my MP and the chief councillor, and I've been fobbed off [by the council] with copied and pasted text they've been publishing on their website. ""They aren't answering my questions directly. I've been asking for reassurances and they've not offered one."" Exposed electrical cables were covered by cardboard Ella May is a single mother-of-three who lives on the ground floor of Taplow. She also feels the urgent works have not been properly completed. She showed the BBC a mass of exposed electrical cables running out of her fuse box into a gaping hole in the ceiling. She says the cables were covered by a council-contracted electrician using cardboard. A week ago the council told her re-boxing the cables properly was urgent safety work but now she has been told the work is superficial. Resident Ella May was told the work required to re-box electrical cables was 'superficial' Camden Council told the BBC it had completed the urgent works identified by the London Fire Brigade (LFB), relating to fire containment issues inside the blocks. The LFB said it had visited the premises since the work began and was satisfied sufficient progress had been made to allow a phased re-occupation of the building. There is further work planned by the council to improve fire doors, it added.

"The Archbishop of Canterbury's trip to Africa has raised the plight of South Sudanese refugees in Uganda, but has also highlighted divisions within the Church of England over same-sex relationships. Above the lush plains of Uganda, two archbishops are on a mission, flying north in a light aircraft towards refugee camps on the border with South Sudan. We are travelling with them. This youngest of nations, which became independent in 2011, has descended into the oldest of enmities - conflict between ethnic groups. The result is that almost one million South Sudanese have been permanently displaced, living in several Ugandan refugee camps. And that number is growing. Despite their desperate circumstances, as soon as the Archbishops of Canterbury and Uganda disembark near the first camp in Moyo, the reception is joyous. Justin Welby met a teacher in the refugee camp who has nearly 800 pupils ""These people are living through the most horrendous suffering,"" says the Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby as he tours the camp. ""Their sense of endurance and perseverance is incredible."" As he enters a mud-walled building, which cannot be more than 12 feet (3.7m) square and is home to a family of five, Mr Welby asks if it can withstand rain? ""No,"" says the father, who points to the single matted carpet that is still damp from the previous day's rainfall. ""This is dreadful,"" is the archbishop's quiet response. Yet compared to the horrors they witnessed in their homeland, these camps are appreciated by most of their inhabitants. South Sudan country profile South Sudan: the fastest growing refugee crisis Church of England: Plea for 'urgency' on new sexuality policy Church split over homosexuality would be a failure - Welby ""What we cannot fail to acknowledge,"" says Mr Welby, ""is the extraordinary response of the Ugandan government. ""The president of Uganda has said that they do not use the word 'refugee' because, in his words, 'We are all Africans'. This is in marked contrast to the xenophobic and racist reaction of some European nations to asylum seekers and refugees."" The majority of those in this camp of 20,000 refugees, rushed towards the border carrying only their children, who must now be educated in classrooms that are designated by markers on trees. One of the teachers, surrounded by hundreds of five and six-year-olds, explains that his ""school"" numbers almost 786 pupils. The Archbishop shouts: ""784"", repeating what he had just heard from the teacher. ""That's incredible."" Throughout his visit, Mr Welby has been accompanied by the Archbishop of Uganda, the Most Reverend Stanley Ntagali. On the issue of refugees, the suffering of displaced persons and the desperate plight of South Sudan, there is complete unanimity. But there are other issues that are troubling their relationship. Mr Ntagali is a leading conservative evangelical, whose province in Uganda is continuing to grow in Christian converts. The Archbishop of Uganda, Stanley Ntagali (r), will not be attending the next archbishops' meeting But he was angered by the American Episcopal Church's decision to endorse same-sex relationships and walked out of a global gathering of archbishops in Canterbury last year. He issued a statement saying that he would not be returning until ""godly order"" had been restored and the Bible returned to what he said is its rightful place ""as the authority for our faith and morals"". Since then, the Canadian and Scottish Episcopal Churches have formally voted to endorse same-sex marriage. Mr Ntagali says the Bible teaches that marriage is between a man and a woman - and that the growing Ugandan church will not remain in fellowship with those who support same-sex unions. A choir of refugees performed for the archbishops ""This is the basis of our faith and it is founded in the Scriptures,"" he explains. It is a theological tussle that has the potential to pull the Anglican Communion apart - a communion that numbers no less than 80 million Christians in 166 countries. The next gathering of archbishops will again take place in Canterbury, this coming October. But Mr Ntagali has written to the Archbishop of Canterbury explaining that he will not be attending. While Mr Welby respects the assertion of strong theological views, he believes that the church should not be split by issues that are not, in his words, ""creedal"", that is, not directly related to the creed of the church. ""It is a constant source of deep sadness,"" he explained after Mr Ntagali walked out of last year's primates meeting, ""that people are persecuted because of their sexuality"". But he also said, ""It is not for us to divide the Body of Christ."" After visiting a second refugee camp near the town of Adjumani, Mr Welby asked all of us to pray for peace and reconciliation in South Sudan. A prayer that he probably repeated, privately, for the church that he leads.

"Late last year, the BBC's Mike Thomson received a desperate call from a bomb shelter in the Syrian city of Aleppo. It came from head teacher and mother of three Om Mudar, who pleaded for help getting her terrified family out of the rebel-held part of the city. When Thomson was unable to make contact again, he feared the worst - but, as he explains here, months later a text message arrived that revealed Om's fate. ""The worse thing is the night, it's so long,"" Om tells me, speaking after an especially heavy air attack last October. ""All the time there are rockets, helicopters, bombs. I'm so afraid for my children. I can't sleep until 5am. Before then, I just pray."" The oldest of her three children, 12-year-old Wissam, then reveals his own technique for getting through the night. ""I sometimes manage to sleep when there is bombing at night by putting my fingers in my ears. When that doesn't work I place a pillow over my head,"" he tells me. Om's sons Zane and Wissam paint a mural in East Aleppo But soon, as pro-government forces close in and the bombing raids get heavier, neither pillows over heads nor fingers in ears are a passport to sleep any more. What remains of rebel-held territory in East Aleppo is being pounded with unparalleled ferocity. Just before 8pm on Tuesday 18 December, my mobile phone pings.  It is a voicemail message from Om. ""Please, please help us get out of Aleppo by safe corridor,"" she pleads. ""Me and my family and my neighbourâ¦ we are terrifiedâ¦ please help us."" Om is a dedicated supporter of the anti-Assad revolution who has sworn to never leave Aleppo, so I know things must now be really bad. Om, on the right, at a rally in East Aleppo I call Om's number, hoping she will be able to hear her phone amid the ear-shattering explosions. There is no response. I try again and again. Finally, after several more attempts I get through. A distressing cacophony of crying children and babies comes on the line. Then I hear Om's clearly petrified voice. She is speaking from an overcrowded basement bomb shelter, packed with distraught people, many of them children. We manage to have the following very brief and harrowing conversation. ""More than 100 people, more than 50 of them childrenâ¦ orphansâ¦ orphans. Their parents were killed by bombing while they were out buying food and they are all alone here."" ""Where did you find these children?"" I ask. ""In hospitals and on the streets."" Then the line cuts out. I redial repeatedly but cannot get through again. Over the following days I call Om numerous times and send messages via social media. There is no response. Listen toLast call from AleppoonAssignment, on the BBC World Service During the many months I have corresponded with her, there have always been times when the internet has been down and we have lost contact for a while. But these periods have never lasted long. So, as days of silence turn into weeks, my fears that she and her family have been killed in the bombing begin to grow. I remember conversations in which Om made clear that she did not expect her family to get out of East Aleppo alive. Take this chilling text message she sent me last November after a night of heavy bombing: ""We do not want anything just let us die silently .. the last breath taken out now.. we are dying..my last message."" Thankfully she did survive that awful bombardment, but did she escape that basement she was sheltering in when we last talked? My hope is that she and her family were safely evacuated from East Aleppo along with 40,000 other people in late December. Worryingly though, none of the evacuees I have spoken to in Idlib province, where the convoy of Aleppo evacuees was taken, has seen Om and her family. As winter rolls into spring, my calls and texts remain unanswered and my hope fades. Then, one evening after arriving home from work, a message appears on my mobile. It is short, and so casual, but its significance is enormous. ""Hi Mike, this is my new number phone. Om Mudar."" Om Mudar in eastern Aleppo Om is alive! I find it hard to believe. After months of silence, in which all my messages and phone calls have gone unanswered, I get this brief, breezy text! She clearly had no idea that I thought she was dead. But, then again, why would she? And it seems her long silence is down to little more than having lost her phone in the dreadful scramble to leave East Aleppo. So, what happened after that traumatic last phone call and where is she now? I waste no time in calling her back to find out. Soon after I board a plane heading for Turkey. Om and her family are now living in Gaziantep, in the south of the country, close to the border with Syria. There, in a quiet suburb of a city that is now home to more than 300,000 Syrian refugees, I am greeted by Om's husband, Salim, an artist. He guides me through a large ornate metal door to a bright, modern-looking ground-floor apartment. The lack of obvious decorations or pictures on the walls suggests that either the family have not lived here long or are not planning on staying. Om Mudar with her daughter Naya and husband Salim I recognise her two smiling boys, Wissam 12, and Zane, 11, from photos and videos Om sent me. Little Naya, her four-year-old daughter, is at first nervous of the tall foreigner, but is soon beaming from ear to ear. Om, wearing a blue denim jacket and traditional black headscarf, greets me warmly and soon begins to talk about conditions in the basement where the family was holed up the last time she spoke to me from Aleppo. There were more than 100 people without food or water, she says, young and old, babies crying, bombs crashing to earth nearby. There was the fear of arrest once government troops arrived, and for women the fear of rape. Zane tells me that the room next door was on fire and buildings outside were collapsing. It was terrifying, he says. Zane's older brother, Wissam, had his own coping mechanism. ""I just closed my ears to everything and did lots of drawing,"" he says. ""When I am drawing I forget everything around me. So I forgot the bombs, I forgot the shelling, I focused only on my drawing."" Wissam and his brother Zane coped with the bombardments by drawing Her sons' accounts bring tears to Om's eyes. She remembers, around this time, seeing other families running towards government-controlled West Aleppo to escape the bombing, and trying to warn them that they might be arrested or killed. ""I shouted, 'Why do you go to death?' They said to me, 'Here is also death.' So, we have no choice."" In the end, on 22 December, she and her family left too. They were among the last 200 people to be evacuated from East Aleppo, under a deal agreed between the rebels and the Syrian government. Before they left, Salim remembers, they burned all of their possessions they couldn't take. ""These were our memories and we didn't want the Syrian regime to take them or abuse them,"" he says. ""All we had left was the clothes we were wearing."" Om Mudar's bombed kitchen The evacuation bus took them all to Idlib. From there the family made their own way north towards Turkey, where Om's mother had already fled. But they had to spend five days on the border, in the cold and rain, waiting for a chance to cross. ""We tried three times and each time we were caught by police,"" she says. ""Finally we made it over the border and after three hours' walking we got to my mother's home."" Om tells me how all of them were covered in mud from head to toe and were put straight into a hot shower by her mother. A few days later, clean and refreshed, they travelled on to Gaziantep. Here, thanks to her teaching experience, Om got a job researching children's programmes for a local television channel. So things worked out so much better for Om than I had feared. The family is safe, well-fed and well-clothed - which makes me unprepared for her next statement. ""This is not my country. I can't live here, I can't,"" she says. This video can not be played Om Hadar explains why she is taking her family back to Syria ""So we decide, my husband, even my kids. We hold a meeting and make a decision to go back to Syria. There are so many kids that need me there. I still am strong. Here I'm weak. If I come back to Syria I will be more strong."" What I am hearing seems hard to believe, so I press for confirmation. ""So, having finally reached safety after months under shell fire and bombing, you are going to leave this smart, secure flat and go back to Syria with your children?"" I ask. ""I want to go back, even (though) I know that it's so dangerous for my family,"" she replies. ""Maybe others think me crazy, but I say to them: 'You don't know what country means.'"" Salim nods his head in agreement. But what about the children, I wonder, what do they think? Sweet little Naya, at just four years old, is too young to ask. But the boys? Having been through so much at such a young age, and knowing what may await them back in Syria, do they really want to do this, I ask 12-year-old Wissam. His words say one thing, but his eyes, which begin to brim with tears as he answers, seem to say another. ""I am not happy here because all of my memories are in Aleppo,"" he says. ""So I'll be happy to go back because at least I will be in my country."" He then adds: ""To die in my own country is better than living outside of it."" Is a child of this age really capable of making a decision such as this? I am not convinced. But there is no doubting the tight bonds that glue this remarkable family together. Although Salim believes that the family's home in East Aleppo is still standing, they have no plans to return there just yet. He says he has heard there is little left to return to. No electricity, no water and no work. Plus, Salim adds, there is a possibility that he and Om might be arrested by the Syrian regime. Instead they aim to join his relatives in a rural area of rebel-controlled Idlib province. To an outsider, including my Syrian translator, this plan seems unwise, particularly given that Idlib could become the next big battlefield in Syria. But the family insist that they have made their decision. Om tells me how she has brought soil with her from the graveyard in East Aleppo where some of her relatives were buried. She plans to use it to plant ""Aleppo trees"" when they get to their new home from home in Idlib. I ask her again why she is doing this, why she is risking so much to go back? This is her answer: ""We don't want anything impossible, just our freedom, social justice and liberty. We have the right to be free.""

"Paris-St Germain have completed their deal to sign Neymar from Barcelona for 222m euros (Â£198m). Some people, including Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp, questioned how this transfer could be allowed under European football's governing bodyUefa's Financial Fair Play (FFP) rules.,external Remember, the Â£198m is only the initial outlay - PSG will also have to pay the Brazilian star that amount in wages over a five-year contract, as well as hefty fees to his father who is his agent and insurance premiums to protect their investment. Barcelona presidentJosep Maria Bartomeu had threatened to report PSG to Uefafor breaching FFP rules. But Uefadoes not have the power to block the deal.In a statement, it told the BBC: ""We are not in a position to stop clubs from buying players, but the clubs will face sanctions if they fail to abide by Financial Fair Play rules."" Uefa introduced break-even FFP rules in 2013 to stop clubs accumulating too much debt and to prevent wealthy owners from injecting too much cash into their clubs. The rules state that over a three-year period a club like PSG, which is owned by the Gulf state of Qatar via its Oryx Qatar Sports Investments fund, can spend 30m euros more than it earns. It is possible that PSG has accumulated lots of profits over the past two years to make it easier for them to make such a big outlay in the current year. Uefa allows spending on things like stadiums, youth development and women's teams to be excluded from the calculations. Barcelona was given the whole transfer fee up front, but that does not mean it has to all be accounted for in the current year. ""For FFP accounting purposes, the transfer fee will be divided over the length of the player's contract,"" says Daniel Geey, a sports lawyer at Sheridans. ""So if it's a five-year deal, that will count as around Â£40m of transfer spending per year."" But Â£40m a year plus wages is still a hefty outlay, so how might PSG balance the books? There has been much talk of the club recouping the outlay by selling lots of Neymar shirts, but Mr Geey is not optimistic. ""It's a complete misnomer that clubs make a fortune from shirt sales increasing after big transfers,"" he says. Kit deals tend to involve a big outlay up front with only limited profit-sharing of 10% to 15% after a certain number of shirts have been sold, he explains, so many millions of extra shirts would have to be sold to make serious inroads into the extra spending. Of course, it may mean the club receives more money from Nike when it comes to renegotiate, but its current deal runs until 2022. PSG is presumably confident that such a high-profile player will help it to sign other commercial deals and there is no limit to the number of official products they could have. We do not know what deal has been struck over Neymar's image rights, but if PSG can get a proportion of those it will help with meeting the FFP rules. Then there is money to be earned on the pitch. PSG is already making a considerable amount of money in the Champions League - in the last five years it has reached the quarter-finals four times and been knocked out in the round of 16 once. Last year, a team getting to the semi-final was paid an extra 7.5m euros (Â£6.7m), the losing finalists earned 11m euros (Â£9.9m) and the winner 15.5m euros (Â£14m). And that's just prize money, there are other pots of cash distributed to successful teams. The club came second in the French league last year but had won the title for the previous four years so there is not much scope for extra prize money there. They may argue that their huge acquisition will make French football more popular and lead to more lucrative television deals from around the world, but that would be a big impact for a single player, although it might help them sell expensive hospitality packages at their stadium the Parc des Princes. Of course, PSG could always balance the books by selling a few of their existing players, but losing them would not help their Champions' League ambitions. PSG fell foul of the FFP rules in 2014 when Uefa ruled that a Â£167m commercial contract with the Qatar Tourism Authority was unfairly generous - effectively, the governing body ruled that Qatar had been using the contract to bypass the FFP rules. They were given a Â£20m fine, their spending was capped at Â£49m and they competed in the 2014-15 Champions League with 21 players in their squad instead of the usual 25.

"Green & Black's Velvet Edition: Cocoa Life, not Fairtrade Green & Black's, which pioneered organic Fairtrade chocolate, is launching its first UK product without a Fairtrade or organic label. The new Velvet Edition dark chocolate bars go on sale in the UK this month. Instead of the Fairtrade mark, it carries the Cocoa Life certification, set up by Mondelez International, the owner of Green & Black's. Mondelez calls Cocoa Life ""a holistic, cocoa sustainability programme in partnership with Fairtrade"". And unlike all other Green & Black's bars, there is no organic label. Glenn Caton, Northern Europe president of Mondelez, said: ""These beans are not available in organic at the scale required for Green and Black's, but I am proud that they are sustainably sourced, independently verified beans from the Cocoa Life programme, of which Fairtrade will ensure we remain an accountable partner for farmers."" Green & Black's was founded on the Portobello Road in London by Craig Sams and Jo Fairley in 1991. Three years later, its Maya Gold bar was the first chocolate in the UK to be awarded the Fairtrade mark. It sources its organic cocoa from the Dominican Republic. All its ranges, apart from the Velvet Edition, will continue to be organic and carry the Fairtrade logo, which is considered to be one of themost widely recognised and trusted ethical brands in the world,external. Mondelez, formerly Kraft Foods, owns Green & Black's through Cadbury's, which bought Green & Black's in 2005, before being bought itself by Kraft in 2010. Its Cocoa Life branding is now rapidly replacing the Fairtrade logo across all its chocolate products.  By 2019, Cadbury's entire chocolate range in the UK and Ireland - including Flake, Twirl and Wispa - will display the Cocoa Life logo. Green & Blacks said in a statement: ""Cocoa Life, which is independently verified, means Green and Black's will build more and stronger relationships with farming communities and become an accountable partner, not just a buyer. "" Cocoa beans ""not available in organic at the scale required for Green and Black's"" The UK Fairtrade label is administered by the Fairtrade Foundation, an independent non-profit organisation, and appears on some 5,000 products. It claims there are more than 1.65 million farmers and workers in 1,226 producer organisations across the Fairtrade system, which guarantees decent working conditions and a minimum price for produce. Last year, it went into partnership with Cocoa Life to create ""greater scale and impact for cocoa farmers and their communities"". It says the partnership means that five times as much Cadbury chocolate will now be made with sustainably sourced cocoa. Fairtrade admitted: ""The cocoa for Cadbury products in the UK and Ireland under Cocoa Life will not be traded according to the Fairtrade Standards of certification."" But it insists farmers will not lose out: ""They will instead receive a competitive price for the cocoa, additional loyalty cash payments plus further investments in projects and support to improve their farming practices and implement community action plans. ""The value of all this will be at least equivalent to that previously delivered under Fairtrade."" Cadbury owner is renamed Mondelez Cadbury's owner scraps Hershey bid Has Fairtrade had its day?

"Stephen was raped in 2011 during the conflict in the Democratic Republic of Congo ""If I talked about it, I would have been separated from the people. Even those who treated me would not have shaken my hands."" Stephen Kigoma was raped during the conflict in his home country, the Democratic Republic of Congo. He described his ordeal in an interview with the BBC's Alice Muthengi, calling for more survivors to come forward. ""I hid that I was a male rape survivor. I couldn't open up - it's a taboo,"" he said. ""As a man, I can't cry. People will tell you that you are a coward, you are weak, you are stupid."" DR Congo: '48 rapes every hour' Army commander led 'mass rape' in DR Congo Rape 'used as torture' in prisons The rape took place when men attacked Stephen's home in Beni, a city in north-eastern DR Congo. ""They killed my father. Three men raped me, and they said: 'You are a man, how are you going to say you were raped?' ""It's a weapon they use to make you silent."" After fleeing to Uganda in 2011, Stephen got medical help - but only after a physiotherapist treating him for a back problem realised there was more to his injuries. He was taken to see a doctor treating survivors of sexual violence, where he was the only man in the ward. ""I felt undermined. I was in a land I didn't belong to, having to explain to the doctor how it happened. That was my fear."" Stephen was treated at the Mulago Hospital, Uganda's biggest referral hospital Stephen was able to get counselling through the Refugee Law Project, an NGO in Uganda's capital, Kampala, where he was one of six men speaking about their ordeal. But they're far from being the only ones. The Refugee Law Project, which has investigated male rape in DR Congo, has also published a report on sexual violence among South Sudanese refugees in northern Uganda. It found that more than 20% of women reported being raped - compared to just 4% of men. ""The main reason that fewer men come forward is that people assume they should be invulnerable, they should fight back. They have allowed it so they must be homosexual,"" Dr Chris Dolan, director of the organisation, told the BBC's Focus on Africa programme. Uganda took in more refugees in 2016 than any other country - most fleeing the conflict in South Sudan Legal challenges pose a problem when it comes to men reporting rape, he added. ""In the Rome Statute [which established the International Criminal Court] you have a definition of rape that is wide enough to include women and men, but in most domestic legislation, the definition of rape involves the penetration of the vagina by the penis. That means if a man comes forward, they'll be told it wasn't rape, it was sexual assault. ""There's the problem of criminalisation of same-sex activity - it revolves around penetration of the male body, not around consent or lack of consent."" In 2016, Uganda took in more refugees than any other country in the world, and has been praised for having some of the world'smost welcoming policies towards them. But for male rape survivors like Stephen, life there can be tough. Homosexual acts are illegal in Uganda, and going to the police to report rape is not always an option. ""When I asked the police, they said that if it has anything to do with penetration between a man and a man, it is gay,"" he said. ""If it happens to a woman, we listen to them, treat them, care and listen to them - give them a voice. But what happens to men?""

"Marcus Hutchins wanted to remain anonymous after the WannaCry outbreak, but his identity was revealed British cyber-security researcher Marcus Hutchins will appear in court in Las Vegas later charged in a US cyber-crime case. The 23-year-old has been accused of involvement with Kronos - a piece of malware used to steal banking logins from victims' computers. Mr Hutchins, from Ilfracombe in Devon, came to prominence after he stalled the WannaCry cyber-attack which hit the NHS in May. The FBI arrested him on Wednesday. The UK's National Cyber Security Centre has said it was aware of the situation with fellow cyber-security researchers expressing surprise at the indictment. WannaCry spread rapidly through computer systems around the world, in an unprecedented outbreak that began on 12 May. Shortly afterwards, Mr Hutchins was thrust into the limelight after he found a way to stop it from spreading. He had been in Las Vegas attending the Black Hat and Def Con cyber-security conferences, but activity on his Twitter feed - usually highly active - ceased two days ago. ""Marcus Hutchins... a citizen and resident of the United Kingdom, was arrested in the United States on 2 August, 2017, in Las Vegas, Nevada, after a grand jury in the Eastern District of Wisconsin returned a six-count indictment against Hutchins for his role in creating and distributing the Kronos banking Trojan,"" the US Department of Justice (DoJ) said in a statement. ""The charges against Hutchins, and for which he was arrested, relate to alleged conduct that occurred between in or around July 2014 and July 2015."" It is not known where Mr Hutchins is being held in custody. Kronos is malware that is designed to steal banking login and other financial data from infected computers. The DoJ's indictment is dated 12 July, before Mr Hutchins arrived in the US. It alleges that he created and sold Kronos on internet forums, including the AlphaBay dark web market,which was recently shut downafter an international law enforcement operation. His mother, Janet Hutchins, said it was ""hugely unlikely"" that her son was involved, saying he had spent ""enormous amounts of time and even his free time"" stopping attacks like these. A second defendant is also included in the indictment, but their name has not been made public. Mr Hutchins tweeted about Kronos shortly after it was reported in the press: ""Anyone got a Kronos sample?"" he wrote. Mr Hutchins tweets under the pseudonym 'MalwareTech' People, who work with Mr Hutchins investigating malware, have said ""it looks like the US justice system has made a huge mistake"". He was arrested while at an airport, his colleagues say, and has not been allowed visitors. Digital rights groups have said they are ""deeply concerned"" by Mr Hutchin's situation. A spokesman for the UK's National Cyber Security Centre said: ""This is a law enforcement matter and it would be inappropriate to comment further."" The DoJ has said Mr Hutchins' case was investigated by the FBI's cyber-crime unit in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. The British Consulate in Los Angeles said it is in contact with the local authorities in Las Vegas and was providing support to his family. The AlphaBay dark web market went offline earlier this month US cyber-attorney Tor Ekeland said Mr Hutchins could face ""40 years in jail"" if found guilty but admitted the case had not named any victims. Speaking on Radio 4's Today, he said alleging that writing software of this type is potentially illegal is ""highly problematic"" for the information security industry. ""I can think of a number of examples of legitimate software that would potentially be a felony under this theory of prosecution."" This video can not be played Marcus Hutchins could face ""decades in jail"", computer-crime attorney Tor Ekeland tells Radio 4's Today Kronos is a type of malware known as a Trojan, meaning it disguises itself as legitimate software. It is thought to be named after a mythological creature. Kronos first came tolight in July 2014,external, when it was advertised on a Russian underground forum for $7,000 (Â£5,330) - a relatively high figure at the time. It was marketed as way to steal logins for banking websites and other financial data. Its vendor boasted it could evade existing anti-virus software and said it worked with the latest versions of Internet Explorer, Firefox and Chrome web browsers. In an unusual step, the developer promised free upgrades and bug fixes and the option of a $1,000 one week trial. After much publicity it faded from view until October 2015, whenIBM researchers reported,externalthat Kronos had been spotted in attacks on UK and Indian bank websites. Kronos then struck again in May 2016, when the cyber-security firm Proofpoint reported it had been used to target customers ofCanadian financial institutions,external. In November Proofpoint reported it hadspotted the Trojan being,externaldistributed via emails sent to organisations involved in the financial services, hospitality, higher education and healthcare industries. The messages contained attachments and links that claimed to be related to Microsoft Sharepoint documents, but in fact led victims' computers to be infected with other malware, including a credit card number-stealing tool.

"This video can not be played Paula plans to cover 1,800 miles, swimming for six hours at a time Paula McGuire was once too afraid of the water to walk down the steps into the shallow end of a pool. Now she is to embark on a challenge to become the first person to swim round the coast of mainland Britain. The 36-year-old, from the east end of Glasgow, describes herself as a recovering aquaphobe and ""basket case"". ""I am someone who has had a lot of problems with social anxiety and mental health,"" she says. ""I used to be so terrified of failing that I just wouldn't try anything."" But something changed when she turned 30 - a realisation that unless she did something, she might continue life as a ""functioning recluse"" for another 30 years. The first fear she decided to tackle was learning to ride a bike. By all accounts it wasn't pretty. Paula left her first adult class knee deep in bruises. But she stuck at it, and eventually she was able to triumphantly cycle round Glasgow's Sir Chris Hoy Velodrome. Despite getting battered and bruised in the process, Paula learned to ride a bike In a campaign she named ""Paula must try harder,external"", she had a go at all 17 sports featured in the Glasgow Commonwealth Games. After the games, she kept setting herself more challenges - from stripping naked as a life model for an art class and flying a jet to simply shopping on her own. ""Everything over the last few years has built me up to this point,"" she says. ""Now I know that the only thing that will make me fail is if I stop trying."" She admits her latest challenge to swim from Land's End to John o' Groats and back may seem ""a bit ridiculous since I've only recently learned to swim"". Over about five months she plans to cover 1,800 miles, swimming for six hours at a time, sometimes starting in the middle of the night to beat the tides. ""But I've no doubt that I'll do it,"" she says. ""With the right attitude and support, I'm a firm believer that we can achieve incredible things."" As someone with a fear of water who has learned to swim, Paula perhaps knows this better than anyone. Paula has developed coping mechanisms to help her manage panic attacks She describes the process as the equivalent of ""trying to learn to knit while running away from a bear"". ""When I was being instructed I couldn't really take anything in,"" she says. ""I would be shaking, I could randomly burst into tears. ""My head would be going a million miles an hour, and I would be trying to calm my body down."" Over time she developed coping mechanisms. She learned to focus on her breathing and to ""connect"" herself to things around her by naming things she could see, hear and feel. In true Paula style, she just kept trying and it paid off. ""Thinking back, I couldn't even stand in the water, I couldn't even get near a puddle without breaking into a sweat,"" she says. ""But now it's where I go when I want to relax, it's my place of peace. ""There's nothing quite like moving through the water under my own steam, putting one arm in front of the other- it's almost dreamlike. ""Even though I do still have mild panics in the water, it is a place of comfort for me now."" Next May she will step out of her comfort zone once more, and wade into the water at Land's End to start her challenge. Paula hopes to raise awareness about mental health, and to show people who have these issues that you can still have a fulfilling life. ""Looking ahead to next year, I know that there will be days when I am exhausted and the fear will take over,"" she says. ""But as long as I keep trying and keep swimming I know that I will succeed.""

"Rashan Charles died after being apprehended by police in Dalston A man who died after a police chase in London had a package in his throat containing ""a mixture of paracetamol and caffeine"", investigators have said. Rashan Charles wasfollowed by officers in Dalston on 22 Julyand became ill after putting an object in his mouth. In a statement, the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) said the package was ""wrapped in plastic"". Commissioner Cindy Butts added the police watchdog had not yet been given a confirmed cause of death. Mr Charles' death sparked a number of protests in east London,including one which turned violent. Violence broke out in Kingsland Road during a protest over the death of Mr Charles Ms Butts said the IPCC had decided to release information about what was in the package ""given the inflammatory nature of some ongoing speculation"". Last week the police watchdog said the evidence it had seen so far suggested the 20-year-old had been followed by a police officer into a shop on Kingsland Road. The officer then restrained Mr Charles and attempts were made to remove an object from his mouth or throat. His condition later deteriorated and a police medic was called to provide assistance before paramedics arrived. Ms Butts said the IPCC echoed the family's appeal for calm after a wave of angry protests and violent clashes amid accusations of alleged police brutality. The police watchdog's announcement came after shadow home secretary Diane Abbott said the initial forensic findings would cause ""deep concern"" after  figures showed a ""disproportionate"" use of force against minority groups by police. On Tuesday figures released for the first time showed Metropolitan Police officers used ""force"" at a rate of around once every 10 minutes. There were 12,605 incidents of force against people by individual officers registered in the three months to the end of June. The data showed 45% of the individuals subject to force were white, 36% black and 10% from the Asian community.

"This video can not be played Households have cut spending since Brexit, says Bank of England's Mark Carney The governor of the Bank of England has warned that uncertainty over Brexit is already weighing on the economy. Mark Carney's comments came as the Bank voted to hold rates and cut growth forecasts. It edged this year's growth forecast down to 1.7% from its previous forecast of 1.9% made in May. It also cut its forecast for 2018 from 1.7% to 1.6%. Sterling dropped to a nine-month low against the euro after the downward revision to the growth forecasts. The pound fell about 0.76% to 1.1063 euros. The bank voted 6-2 to keep interest rates on hold at 0.25%. They have been at that level since August last year. Mr Carney said that business investment was slower than it would have been expected to be because of Brexit. ""It's evident in our discussions across the country with businesses,"" he said, ""that uncertainties about the eventual relationship are weighing on the decisions of some businesses."" He said that investment had been weaker than otherwise would have been expected ""in a very strong world"" and the consequences of that was starting to build: ""The speed limit of the economy, if you will, has slowed."" Mr Carney said the Bank expected business investment to pick up from its current ""very subdued"" levels, but that it was still below historic rates. He added that Brexit uncertainty was also hitting pay negotiations. ""There is an element of Brexit uncertainty which is affecting the wage bargaining. Some firms, potentially a material number of firms, are less willing to give bigger pay rises given that it is not as clear what their market access is going to be over the course of the next few years,"" he said. Former British Chambers of Commerce director general and co-chairman of pro-Brexit lobby group Leave Means Leave, John Longworth, said he agreed that business confidence is ""lower than it ought to be"". Mr Longworth added that Bank of England was ""notoriously bad at forecasting"", so ""we should always take it with a pinch of salt"". Analysis: BBC business editor Simon Jack The big squeeze on incomes will get tighter from here and will last longer than previously thought. At the moment, prices are rising 2.6% while wages are rising just 2%. That gap is expected to widen later this year. Inflation is expected to peak at about 3% in October, as the surge in import prices caused by the post-Brexit-referendum drop in the pound continues to feed through to shop prices. When prices rise faster than wages, we get poorer on average every day. This explains why the Bank cut its forecast for economic growth for this year and next. It is also the main reason why the Bank of England has decided - for the 120th month in a row - not to raise interest rates. Read more here FTSE rises on Bank move Simon Jack: Wage squeeze to get tighter The Bank is also now gloomier on prospects for wage growth and thinks wages will grow by 3% in 2018, down from the 3.5% estimate it made in May. Weak wage growth, combined with rising inflation, has been weighing on the spending power of households. There has not been an interest rate rise since July 2007. Many economists think the UK could see a move this year and recent speeches by Bank officials have raised that expectation. Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) member Andrew Haldane recently said an increase might be ""prudent"" in the second half of this year. The bank highlighted that the 18% fall in the pound since November 2015 has been raising the price of imports for the UK, which in turn has been making life more expensive for consumers. Shoppers may have noticed significant increases in the prices of items such as butter, meat and computer software. The bank also said there had been evidence that spending on cars, home wares and electrical goods had been falling. It also noted weakness in the housing market and a fall in consumer confidence, which it thinks could indicate that households will curb their spending in the months to come. The bank expects wage growth of just 2% this year, which is well below price inflation, currently running at 2.6%. To help bridge the gap between weak wage growth and inflation, consumers have been borrowing more, aided by low rates. In its report, the Bank said that interest rates on a Â£10,000 personal loan were close to record lows. Bank officials have been expressing concern about household debt. Last week, Alex Brazier, the financial stability director, warned that High Street banks risked entering a ""spiral of complacency"" over mounting consumer debt. Members of the MPC also voted in favour of extending a credit facility to British banks from Â£100bn to Â£115bn. The so-called Term Funding Scheme (TFS) runs until February 2018 and has already lent Â£78bn to banks at close to the bank's base rate of 0.25%. The TFS is backed by the Treasury.

"Ex-EastEnders actor Joseph Shade admitted sex offences against three girls between 2012 and 2015 Former EastEnders actor Joseph Shade has admitted sexual offences against three teenage girls. The youth worker, from Sheringham in Norfolk, played Peter Beale as a child from 1998 until 2004. Shade, 24, admitted five counts of causing or inciting a child under 18 to engage in sexual activity while in a position of trust and one count of sexual activity with a child. He was released on bail and will be sentenced at a later date. The offences were committed against three girls aged between 14 and 17, and happened between 2012 and 2015, Norwich Crown Court heard. More news from Norfolk Shade was a youth worker at a project in Norfolk at the time when he sent sexual text messages to girls and touched one on the bottom, prosecutor Chris Paxton said. The former soap actor had been helped by the youth project himself, but ""as he reached the age of 18 he became formally employed as a youth worker... and engaged with many young people who came from similar backgrounds and vulnerabilities as he had"", Mr Paxton said. He played the character Peter Beale (being carried, above) between 1998 and 2004 ""During the course of his employment he accepts by his pleas that his relationships became too close to a number of attendees and he would engage with them by texting them messages asking them to have sex or to send sexual pictures of breasts and the like. ""On one occasion and only one occasion he touched one of them."" Shade had no previous convictions and was ""tearful and expressed a degree of remorse"" when interviewed by police, Mr Paxton told the court. Joseph Shade denied the charges when he first appeared in court last December He had initially denied 11 sexual offences against four girls, but changed his plea, admitting to six counts against three of the teenagers. The prosecution ordered the remaining five counts to lie on file. Judge Maureen Bacon warned Shade he could face a jail sentence. Speaking after the hearing, an NSPCC spokesman said: ""Shade was trusted to protect children but he appallingly abused this trust by carrying out sex offences against them. ""Crimes of this nature can have a lasting effect on children and [his] young victims must receive all appropriate support to recover."" Shade is one of a number of actors who have appeared in the BBC soap playing Ian and Cindy Beale's son, Peter. The character was named after his grandfather, market stallholder Pete Beale.

"With his instantly recognisable voice and British bulldog manner, Robert Hardy enjoyed a distinguished acting career which spanned eight decades. By the time he endeared himself to television audiences in the BBC's All Creatures Great and Small, he had already carved out a reputation as one of Britain's most versatile actors. While his earlier career gave him a firm grounding in the theatre his best known roles were in front of the camera - particularly in television, a medium he obviously enjoyed. He became something of a specialist in the role of Sir Winston Churchill, playing the great man on half a dozen occasions as well as being in demand to reproduce the wartime leader's voice. Timothy Sydney Robert Hardy was born in Cheltenham on 29 October 1925. The youngest of a large family, he was a self-professed ""odd child"". His father was the headmaster of Cheltenham College and Hardy himself went to Rugby School before going up to Magdalen College, Oxford to read English. It was while at Oxford that he struck up an enduring friendship with a fellow student, Richard Burton and both men found their studies interrupted when they were called up and posted to an RAF station in Norfolk. Robert Hardy as Henry V in a 1960 BBC production Unlike Burton, Hardy returned to Oxford after his war service and gained a BA (Hons) in English as well as having enjoyed the opportunity to study under two of Oxford's most eminent names, JRR Tolkien and CS Lewis. He had always been fascinated by Hollywood films and had determined to become an actor, joining the Shakespeare Memorial Theatre in 1949. He was once asked what was needed to be successful in such a competitive profession. ""A certain amount of talent, luck, a spine of steel, a ruthlessness of mind that does not jib at murder and patience,"" he replied. He was much in demand as a stage actor during the 1950s mainly playing Shakespearean roles, although he did make his first foray into cinema in 1958 playing a naval officer in the Glenn Ford film Torpedo Run. He turned down Sir Peter Hall's offer of a contract with the Royal Shakespeare Company in 1960, complaining that it was for middle-of-the-roadish parts. ""I stormed at him one day and I behaved extremely badly,"" he said. He was reunited with his friend Richard Burton in the 1965 film, The Spy Who Came In From the Cold, where he played the role of Dick Carlton. A year later he was given his first continuing role as the ruthless businessman Alex Stewart in the BBC production, The Troubleshooters, a drama based on a fictitious oil company called Mogul. In 1978, Hardy took the part of the irascible but good-natured Siegfried Farnon in All Creatures Great and Small, the long-running BBC series based on James Herriot's best-selling books. As the senior vet of the small Yorkshire Dales practice, Robert Hardy became one of the best-known faces on British television. Robert Hardy, Carol Drinkwater and Christopher Timothy in All Creatures Great and Small Full of animals, nostalgia and rural scenery, the show became a massive hit, attracting audiences of up to 20 million. The original run ended in 1978 but the series was revived 10 years later after the BBC obtained permission to write new storylines, having exhausted the original James Herriot books. But the new scripts failed to meet with Hardy's approval and he rewrote large parts of his dialogue. ""All they did was make Siegfried explode and be bad-tempered. I kept changing things."" Hardy cornered the market in the role of blustering aristocrat, often dressed in tweed. He appeared in The Far Pavilions, The Cleopatras, Bramwell and Middlemarch, and on the big screen in The Shooting Party and Sense and Sensibility. He explained: ""When you've lived a goodish span as I have, it's a case of roaming round the attic and borrowing a few characters."" Despite this range, Robert Hardy's own volatility and ability to express his wrath were channelled most successfully into his many portrayals of Britain's most revered premier. He played Winston Churchill many times, even once in French on stage in Paris, but most memorably in the 1981 mini-series The Wilderness Years. Hardy said himself of his complete immersion into the character, ""My family complained loudly about my behaviour while I was playing him."" Hardy played Sir Toby Belch in the BBC's Twelfth Night He was married twice and had three children. Awarded a CBE in 1981 for his services to acting, Hardy was also a keen student of military history and supported the project to raise the Mary Rose. In 1995, he gave up his long-time home in Oxfordshire, to become laird of a Scottish mansion, a 13th Century miniature castle situated near Edinburgh, complete with a walled garden and 50-foot tower. The actor had visited the place as a child and sworn always to return, following in the footsteps of a previous visitor, Sir Walter Scott, one of Hardy's personal heroes. In later years he suffered from cancer of the colon, but recovered to resume as busy a career as ever, including film work. Although he failed to make the lasting impact on Hollywood enjoyed by some British actors, his face became known the world over when he appeared as the Minister of Magic, Cornelius Fudge, in several of the Harry Potter films. He was dropped from the role after the studio balked at paying a Â£1 million life insurance premium which was demanded because of his advancing age. Off screen he became something of an authority on the English longbow, his interest having been stimulated when, as a child, he found two of the weapons in the family attic . He wrote two books on the history of the weapon as well as presenting a BBC documentary on the subject. Hardy's on-screen temper was matched by a famously short fuse away from the camera and he admitted that, as an actor, he belonged to a set of ""difficult people"".

"This video can not be played ""Monkmania"" took the nation by storm If watching University Challenge makes your head hurt, you might want to take an aspirin before listening to a new show Radio 4 are planning. Eric Monkman and Bobby Seagull - the breakout stars of the last series of the BBC Two quiz show - are getting behind the microphone. The pairwill presentMonkman and Seagull's Polymathic Adventure on BBC Radio 4 on 21 August. The duo became friends during filming, despite being captains of rival teams. University Challenge: Why do the contestants go viral? Why Monkman is a winner, despite losing Monkman and Seagull each went viral in their own right, with the former proving so popular he sparked what was termed ""Monkmania"" among viewers. The Cambridge economics student attracted a loyal following for his animated - and very meme-able - facial expressions. Monkman and Seagull became friends after appearing on the show The 29-year-old's blue jumper, impressive intellect and tendency to answer questions with an upward inflection cemented his place in the hearts of quiz show fans. He and Seagull became friends off screen and even travelled to interviews together during the series as their popularity soared. So what will their new radio show actually be about? Good question. The pair are set to explore whether being highly intelligent is actually a useful quality. They will discuss whether it's possible to be a useful polymath (a person of wide knowledge or learning) with guests including Stephen Fry. If this goes well, we're keeping our fingers crossed it's just the start of their media careers. Surely introducing Justin Bieber songs on Radio 1 would be the next logical step?

"Britons need to get to know their neighbours, a former Downing Street advisor has said, as he launched a campaign to encourage people to connect in real life. Max Chambers says social media has allowed people to ""live in a bubble"" with people they already know. But he wants them to ""share a cuppa"" with someone in their area in August. It comes after a survey suggests 60% of people do not know their neighbours well or at all. Mr Chamber's social network Nextdoor has teamed up with Neighbourhood Watch and a charity called The Challenge to call on the government to create an official national Good Neighbours Day in 2018. Do you have a good neighbour? Do you feel you can rely on them in time of need? Tell us your stories by emailinghaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,externalor get in touch on WhatsApp 07555 173285. They want it to be a follow-up tothe Great Get Together - organised by Brendan Cox in memory of murdered Labour MP Jo Cox. A survey of 2,000 people commissioned by Nextdoor suggests some 75% of people say they would not want their neighbour to look after their pet while on holiday. Almost two-thirds of people said they would not feel confident leaving a spare key with their neighbour. Mr Chambers warned that the internet meant people were ""losing touch with those immediately around us"". Some 63% said they never borrowed something or exchanged favours with the people next door. The unlikely friendship from World War Two Speaking on BBC Radio West Midlands, he said: ""Organisations like Facebook and Twitter allow us to live in a bubble with people we already know maybe that we went to school with or know through work. ""It's meaning we're interacting with different kinds of people less and less."" Asked what his former role with counter-terrorism had to do with communities, Mr Chambers said he had seen first hand the UK becoming less integrated. Dame Louise Casey, government advisor on social integration, said recent events like the Grenfell Tower fire had shown ""how powerful the public can be when we pull together, united in the common good to protect and care for each other"". ""Government and public services will always have a role in this but it is the public, residents and families, first and foremost who are in the best position to knit that social fabric together."" The West Midlands is the most neighbourly area in the UK with 59% saying they feel very or somewhat connected to their neighbourhood. Wales, Yorkshire and the West Midlands are the regions where people are most friendly with their neighbours People in Northern Ireland and Scotland feel the most lonely in the communities they live in. Londoners are least likely to know the names of their neighbours.

"Air passengers in Ottawa, Canada rang the emergency services after they were trapped on a delayed flight without food or water. Two separate Air Transat flights were diverted to Ottawa airport on Monday due to bad weather, leaving passengers on one of the planes stuck for more than five hours. The Canadian Transportation Agency has launched an inquiry to examine the two incidents. ""Air travel is an integral part of modern life. Usually, it goes smoothly, but if something goes wrong, passengers have rights,"" said agency chair Scott Streiner. ""This inquiry will determine, based on the evidence and the law, whether the treatment of passengers on the two flights was in line with the airline's obligations - and if not, what corrective measures should be ordered,"" he added. Passenger Laura Mah was on an Air Transat flight from Brussels to Montreal that was forced to land due to thunderstorms. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"Lloyd told benefits assessors he could not bend or stretch and needed walking aids A benefits cheat who won a triathlon and climbed Mount Kilimanjaro while claiming he could not walk more than 50 metres has been jailed for 20 weeks. Mark Lloyd, of Ynysybwl, Rhondda Cynon Taff, received Â£6,551.80 in Personal Independence Payments, saying a slipped disc in his back left him in agony. At the same time, he took part in the World Powerboat Championships. He wasconvicted of fraudat Merthyr Tydfil Magistrates' Court in July but sentenced on Thursday. Lloyd claimed the cash between October 2014 and February 2016, but magistrates at his trial were shown photos of him competing in the HSBC triathlon in September 2015 - a race he won in the adult taster category. That month, he also took part in a five-day trek to the peak of Kilimanjaro in Tanzania, which involved walking between eight and 12 hours a day. He also took part in the World Powerboat Championships in Malta and went skiing in the Alps. Despite this, the court heard he claimed he needed assistance to use the lavatory, could not stand in the kitchen and took an hour to prepare a meal. Magistrates heard Lloyd was called ""Action Man Mark"" because of his love of physical activity District Judge Martin Brown said Lloyd, a former paratrooper, ""exaggerated grossly"" his condition, while taking part in ""a number of gruelling events"". ""You were in abuse of your position having served well in the Parachute Regiment,"" he said. ""What you did attracted attention and you got plaudits."" He called Lloyd's claims ""fanciful"", saying he had ""no basis"" for claiming benefits. Lloyd was medically discharged from the Army in 2011 after suffering an injury to his lower back while serving in Afghanistan. In 2014, he applied for the Personal Independence Payment - up to Â£141 a week for those suffering long-term ill health to help cover the costs of their care. The following year, he applied for more money, saying his condition had worsened and he would be bedridden for a day if he walked more than 164ft (50m). Lloyd was also in breach of a road rage incident Defence solicitor James Harris said Lloyd suffers from post traumatic stress disorder as a result of his service, which was undiagnosed at the time of the offences and may have impacted on his behaviour. The defendant works in online advertising, a form of Bitcoin mining, and said he had the equivalent of US$5,000 he could use to pay a fine. But the judge said he had ""blatantly lied throughout"" and sentenced him to 20 weeks in prison, of which he will serve half. The offence put him in breach of a suspended sentence relating to a road rage incident in May 2015, the judge added. He imposed eight weeks of this, which will be served concurrently. Lloyd was also ordered to pay Â£620 costs and Â£115 victim surcharge.

"Ian Paterson has had his jail sentence increased from 15 to 20 years by Court of Appeal judges A breast surgeon who intentionally wounded his patients has had his 15-year jail term increased to 20 years. Ian Paterson, 59, who appeared at the Court of Appeal via video link, was told his current sentence was ""not sufficient"" to reflect the seriousness and the totality of his offending. Paterson was found guilty in April at Nottingham Crown Court of 17 counts of wounding with intent. Jurors also convicted him of three further wounding charges. Explaining the decision to increase his jail term, one of the three Appeal Court judges - Lady Justice Hallett - told Paterson his victims had been, ""left feeling violated and vulnerable"". She described his treatment of patients as ""brutal and sustained"". ""They have lost their trust in others, particularly some in the medical profession,"" she said. This video can not be played Victim Debbie Douglas: ""I didn't think I'd be so emotional"" ""Some have experienced long-term psychological effects."" Representing Paterson, Nicholas Johnson QC said ""his crimes are truly notorious"". He said in prison the surgeon was regarded as a ""marked man"" so had to be kept apart from other inmates. Surgeon 'psychopathic like Shipman' 'He took a pound of flesh for money' That decision has been met with some satisfaction by Ian Paterson's victims who have come to the Court of Appeal today. They were hoping for at least 20 years when he was sentenced to 15 years in Nottingham at the end of May. They felt that day, that whilst they were glad he had gone to prison, that he should have been sent to prison for longer. Paterson has appeared via video link from Nottingham Prison. He was taking notes and shaking his head occasionally. Lady Justice Hallett said the Appeal Court judges had to impose a ""just and proportionate sentence"". The judges found the exercise difficult but they did think the original sentence had been unduly lenient. They said there had been a breach of trust and an abuse of power and took into account the vulnerability of the patients - some of whom were under his care for a decade or more. She said ultimately the 15-year sentence just was not long enough, given the totality of all of those factors. Paterson, of Altrincham, Greater Manchester, wasjailed in Mayfollowing an eight-week trial trial. This video can not be played What is cleavage-sparing surgery? The court heard from nine women and one man who were treated in the private sector at Little Aston and Parkway Hospitals, run by Spire Healthcare, in the West Midlands between 1997 and 2011. However the case was referred to the Court of Appeal by Solicitor General Robert Buckland. Mr Buckland argued that Paterson's offending was ""so serious and so exceptional"" that a jail term ""significantly higher"" than 15 years was required. This video can not be played Solicitor General Robert Buckland says Ian Paterson ""systematically mutilated"" vulnerable victims The trial heard Paterson, who treated thousands of patients during his career, exaggerated or invented cancer risks and claimed payments for more expensive procedures in some cases. Jurors were not told Paterson also carried out hundreds of unnecessary operations on NHS patients, with a hospital trust paying out Â£17.8m in damages and legal costs. In October, more than 500 of Paterson's private patients who had unnecessary operations will seek compensation at the High Court. Paterson was found guilty of wounding patients at Spire private hospitals Linda Millband from Thompsons Solicitors, which is representing them, said: ""Many of our clients were subjected to significant harm at the hands of Mr Paterson and some have been left with life-long conditions. ""While no length of sentence can undo this harm, it seems right and fair that this otherwise lenient sentence was revised, and extended by the courts."" Diane Green, who was given two unnecessary double mastectomies by Ian Paterson, said: ""I lost everything - my home, my job, my marriage - as a result of what that man did. ""While no amount of jail time can repay or make up for what he did, a sentence 15 years... was never going to be enough for maiming and butchering hundreds of women like me."" ""It is encouraging to see the Court of Appeal listening to victims like me and extending the sentence to 20 years.""

"The WannaCry ransomware infected computers around the world More than $140,000 (Â£105,000) worth of bitcoins paid by victims of the WannaCry ransomware outbreak have been removed from their online wallets. It has been nearly three months since infections struck organisations worldwide, including the NHS, which faced days of disruption as a result. The bitcoin activity was noticed bya Twitter bot,externalset up by Quartz journalist Keith Collins. The balance of all wallets known to be associated with WannaCry is now zero. The ransomware hit many businesses hard, quickly infecting multiple computers on corporate networks and encrypting them so they became useless. Victims were asked to pay between $300 and $600 to get their systems back. Back in May, manycyber-security experts and law enforcement agencies advised victimsthat paying the ransom would probably only encourage other cyber-criminals and not result in restored access to computers. However, many clearly decided to take a chance. This video can not be played Technology explained: what is ransomware? According to bitcoin-monitoring company Elliptic, an initial portion of the WannaCry fundswere moved in late July,external. And at about 04:10 BST on Thursday, the vast majority were finally withdrawn in entirety. Many watchers expect that the WannaCry bitcoins will be put through a ""mixer"" - in which the currency is transferred and mixed into a larger series of payments that make it much harder to track where it ends up. But the incident has left some cyber-security experts confused. ""I have no idea why they would move that money to be honest,"" said Andy Patel at F-Secure. ""I wouldn't imagine that they are going to try and turn those bitcoins into real money. If they do, it's going to give someone a way to track them to an actual person."" Instead, Mr Patel told the BBC the funds could be used to pay for dark web services that might leave less of a digital paper trail. In July, bitcoins paid as ransom following a separate attack - NotPetya - were moved from their online wallets. Many people assume Bitcoin is anonymous: the online equivalent of cash. However, every transaction is completely visible to anyone who cares to look. There are even online sites that allow you to view what is happening in the blockchain - the distributed ledger that records all bitcoin movements. The blockchain is more like a Swiss bank account: you know the account number and which account transfers money to which other accounts, but you don't necessarily know who stands behind that account number. A technique called ""cluster analysis"" looks across all of these bitcoin addresses and attempts to find addresses that are being used by the same people. Then, some of the other transactions in that cluster, which were not intended to be anonymous, can provide evidence of who owns those addresses. Law enforcement agencies often use this classic approach to track criminals - the idea, of course, is: ""Follow the money."" Alan Woodward is professor of cyber-security at the University of Surrey.

"This video can not be played Johnny Mercer MP talks to Mark D'Arcy about his journey to Westminster Frustrated by out-of-touch politicians and the poor treatment of veterans, former army commando Johnny Mercer decided the best course of action was to become an MP. He spoke to the BBC's Mark D'Arcy about his new book, which charts his journey to Westminster. The prospect of becoming a politician wasn't particularly appealing for Johnny Mercer and it was a career move that ""disappointed"" his wife. He says he belongs to a generation that has ""very little faith"" in the political class. Such was his disengagement that, until he became an MP two years ago, he'd never voted in an election. Even now, when asked if he's a politician, he balks at the idea and jokes: ""That's not really a term people are going to queue up to get is it? I would hate to say yes but I suppose I'm a Member of Parliament so yes, I guess in some ways I may be."" Despite his reservations, the former army commando - who completed three tours of Afghanistan - felt he had  a ""calling"" to bridge what he calls the ""appalling"" gap between what politicians say about military action and the realities of war. A Conservative MP since 2015, Johnny Mercer told BBC Parliament'sBooktalk programme:""I got fed up of the difference between what people say in the House of Commons and these platitudes that come out on Remembrance Day and how that actually feels for people who've lost their sons and daughters in operations. This video can not be played Mercer: 'Looking after veterans isn't sexy' ""That gap is appalling and in some ways it still remains. For a nation to treat its servicemen like that, in my view, is unacceptable and that is what's fuelled this change to a career in politics, which is hugely challenging - and I don't always enjoy it - but there's work to be done and I'm determined to do it."" His time in Afghanistan included seeing his friend Mark Chandler shot dead next to him. He is among the 456 British servicemen and women killed in that country. Another friend later committed suicide, leaving a note saying: ""Ever since I came back from hell I've turned into a horrible person and I don't like who I am anymore."" The UK began military operations in Afghanistan in 2001 - in the wake of the 9/11 attacks. From 2006, the UK was based in Helmand, one of the most dangerous regions in a volatile country. The UK's involvement in the conflict ended in 2014 although around British 500 troops are still there, training the Afghan army. David Cameron was given a ""sanitised"" view of the Afghan conflict, the MP believes Over the 13-year combat period three prime ministers - Tony Blair, Gordon Brown and David Cameron - came and went. The MP recalled visits to Afghanistan by ministers who, he says, were given a ""sanitised"" version of the operation. ""I remember looking at them, the likes of David Cameron and William Hague, and thinking... you don't really know what I'm going on about - but you make the executive decisions because you are elected."" Mr Mercer was speaking to BBC Parliament about his book - ""We Were Warriors: One Soldier's Story Of Brutal Combat"" - in which he gives a frank account of a challenging childhood, his military career and his decision to stand as Conservative MP for Plymouth Moor View. He said the decision to become an MP ""was not particularly appealing... my wife was thoroughly disappointed, but I'm afraid when you've got a calling and you believe in something, you're prepared to take the hits as you go."" There was no road to Damascus moment. It was prompted by what he judged to be ignorance at Westminster, the failure to treat army personnel properly when they got home - and having a family. This video can not be played Johnny Mercer's maiden Commons speech focused on veterans' care ""When you're running into rooms not knowing what's there, it's inherently dangerous, and as you get older and you get married and you have children, you're making that calculation all the time - is this sensible? ""You go through all these internal battles. Am I turning into a bit of a wimp? Those things came together and I thought I'm not prepared to accept the way we treat our servicemen in this country."" He chose the Conservative Party because it was his ""nearest home"". But that certainly doesn't mean he agrees with everything the party does. He thought the Conservatives were on the ""wrong side of the argument"" in the past by opposing gay marriage and the minimum wage. He has also polled his constituents on fox hunting in a form of direct democracy - he pledged to vote for whichever view had the majority. What steered him towards the Conservative Party was its position on welfare reform because he believes it is not ""right"" for people to be better off on benefits than in work. ""I don't blame people for having a life on benefits. That's the system. But what you can do is change the system and that's why I decided to join the Conservative Party."" Johnny Mercer increased his majority in this year's general election. Since then, he's been trying to challenge the narrative he thinks has developed around veterans that they are in some way ""broken"" and ""not much use for anything"". ""I think the vast majority of veterans contribute wonderfully to life after their service. We just need to give a little bit of help to some of them at the right time. ""With veterans' care if you intervene early enough, upstream, before people get really poorly with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, before they hit substance abuse or homelessness... you can change the whole conversation around it."" And he feels there is no time to lose. ""If we don't tackle this veterans' care problem now, it's just going to get worse. There are some brilliant organisations in this country who are doing some amazing things, if the government could take a lead and coordinate it."" ""The thing is, veterans' care is not sexy. Looking after people isn't sexy but I would argue it's a fundamental part of conflict, of what we do in this country. The Americans are much more ahead of the game than us on this and I would like to see us catch them up - because the blokes deserve it."" * You can watch Mark D'Arcy's interview with Johnny Merceron BBC iPlayer.

"Listening figures for Evans (left) are down while Grimshaw's see an increase Chris Evans's BBC Radio 2 breakfast show lost almost half a million listeners in the past year, figures show. It comes just weeks after he was namedas the BBC's highest paid star. The DJ drew 9.01m listeners a week between April and June 2017, down from 9.47m over the same period in 2016, according to figures by audience research body Rajar. He was paid between Â£2.2m and Â£2.25m during that same year. The figures show Evans lost 370,000 listeners between the first and second quarter of this year - before his salary was published. Chris Evans tops best-paid BBC stars list Reprieve for Radio 4's Saturday Review University Challenge stars get own radio show It's better news for Nick Grimshaw - whose breakfast show on Radio 1 saw its weekly audience rise by 350,000 listeners on the previous quarter to reach 5.5m. It is also an increase on the 5.43m listeners who tuned in during the same period in 2016. Rickie, Melvin and Charlie co-host the Kiss breakfast show Radio 1 as a whole saw its audience jump by nearly half a million between April 3 and July 25 - with 9.6m listeners compared with 9.1m in the first three months of 2017. The figures show Radio 4's Today programme has increased its weekly listeners to reach a record high - with 7.66m tuning in during the second quarter, compared to 7.13m three months earlier. Radio 4 itself also reached its biggest audience since records began in 1999 - with 11.55m listeners every week. Bob Shennan, director of BBC radio and music, said Radio 4 was ""as vital as ever as it approaches its 50th anniversary"". The BBC's figures overall were ""fantastic news for radio, illustrating its enduring appeal in a crowded digital marketplace"", he added. The Today programme attracted its biggest ever audience LBC's audience also increased, with 2m listeners a week between April and June 2017, compared to 1.7m over the same period in 2016. The station's parent company Global said it was an all-time high for LBC, with presenters Nick Ferrari and James O'Brien both reaching record audiences. Radio X, which was rebranded from XFM in 2015, also reached its best weekly audience yet with 1.4 million. Alan Brazil's breakfast show on talkSPORT lost about 400,000 listeners, with 1.6m a week in the 2016 period down to 1.2m in 2017. The figures show the morning slot on Kiss saw its weekly audience drop slightly to 2m in the last quarter from 2.1m. But the programme, hosted by Rickie, Melvin and Charlie, remains the most popular commercial breakfast show in the UK. Classic FM's symphonies struck the right chords as its weekly audience increased by over 200,000. And Heart 80s - a new station that launched in March and plays exclusively eighties music - attracted 850,000 listeners in its first Rajar quarter.

"Sir James said: ""It is a disgrace... that a judge in 2017 should be faced with the problems thrown up by this case"" Society should be ""ashamed"" for not protecting a suicidal girl in secure custody, a senior judge has said. The president of Family Division of the High Court said there would be ""blood on our hands"" if the 17-year-old did not now receive adequate supervision. She is due to be released in 11 days, but a secure unit place has not yet been found for her - a situation Sir James Munby said was ""utterly shaming"". NHS sources later indicated that three possible beds had been found. Dr Mike Prentice, medical director for the NHS North Region, said: ""A number of options have now been identified, with detailed clinical and social assessments taking place tomorrow (Friday) to ensure the right package of care can be put in place before her release date."" The girl, identified only as ""X"", has tried to kill herself several times. Thejudgement,externalin the case of X - who is in the formal care of Cumbria County Council - revealed she was convicted at a youth court and has been detained in custody for almost six months. Sir James had previously noted the ""enormity of the task facing the local authority"" but stressed that the need for a final care plan was ""overwhelming"". During the latest hearing in July, he emphasised this need further, adding: ""On a large number of occasions... X has made determined attempts to commit suicide"". Staff at the unit where she is being held have said sending her back to her home town would be a ""suicide mission to a catastrophic level"". The judgement said: ""Staff do not think it will take more than 24 to 48 hours before they receive a phone call stating that X has made a successful attempt on her life."" An earlier ruling heard how unit staff had witnessed ""a profoundly disturbing and distressing scene when X self-harmed by repeatedly banging her head and face against the wall"". Staff have said she has to be checked every 50 seconds when she is in the shower. This video can not be played The case reflects a ""wholly unacceptable situation in our country"", says former health minister Norman Lamb Earlier, Simon Rowbotham, the solicitor for the legal guardian of the teenage girl, told the BBC that X has a ""determined wish"" to kill herself and lives in a stripped-down room and is restrained ""for hours on end"". By Mark Easton, home editor, BBC News The problem of providing suitable services for disturbed children and young people has been flagged up to ministers before. Two months ago, after complaints from police that cells were being used to accommodate youngsters who should have been in a mental health unit, the government introduced a law banning their use for such purposes. Doctors are warning there is still a critical shortage of appropriate care beds. A survey of child and adolescent mental health workers, conducted by the Royal College of Psychiatrists in 2015, found 62% had seen adolescent patients held in inappropriate settings, with 14% saying patients had attempted to kill themselves while waiting for a suitable bed. The prime minister has promised a ""revolution"" in mental health care, and the number of mental health staff in the NHS in England is rising by 21,000. But the agonies of a judge unable to help a suicidal young woman suggest the revolution still has some way to go. When X was younger, she ""was a child with poor school attendance, low-level criminality and periods of absconding"", a previous judgement said. In Sir James' judgement, delivered in private in the High Court family division sitting in Manchester, he said: ""If this is the best we can do for X, and others in similar crisis, what right do we, what right do the system, our society and indeed the State itself, have to call ourselves civilised? ""The honest answer to this question should make us all feel ashamed."" People stranded in mental health units 'We've travelled 8,000 miles to see our anorexic daughter' Mental health reforms to focus on young people - PM He went on: ""I feel shame and embarrassment; shame, as a human being, as a citizen and as an agent of the State, embarrassment as President of the Family Division, and, as such, Head of Family Justice, that I can do no more for X"". Liberal Democrat former health minister Norman Lamb told the BBC that the judgement reflected a ""wholly unacceptable situation in our country"". ""This is not a unique case, families are being let down routinely across our country and there is a moral imperative that we address this as a matter of real urgency,"" he said. By Philippa Roxby, health reporter, BBC News There are about 1,440 hospital beds for children and young people with mental health problems in the NHS in England. But a recent review found that they were not evenly spread across the country - for example, some areas had no in-patient beds within a 50-mile radius. The picture is also complicated by who those beds are for - some are in specialist units for children with eating disorders, others are in high dependency units for young people with complex needs. And there are many more specialist beds than high dependency ones. This means that children and their families often travel large distances to access in-patient treatment. NHS England says it wants to change this by increasing the number of beds in badly-served parts of the country and by offering crisis help to children and young people in the community, at an earlier stage. Mr Lamb said if investment was not made up front in the NHS, families would continue to be let down. ""The real problem is that the whole of the finances of the NHS are under such strain that the government's fine words about recruiting extra staff won't be delivered, because the money won't get through to mental health. ""Mental health always loses out whenever the money is tight and I fear that that will be the same again this time."" Earlier this week, Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt announced thatthousands more mental health workers were to be recruitedby the NHS in England. The government said an extra Â£1bn already promised for mental health services in England would fund the scheme - part of a pot of Â£1.3bn committed in 2016 to transform provision. The judge said copies of the ruling would be sent to the chief executive officer of NHS England Simon Stevens, Home Secretary Amber Rudd, Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt, Education Secretary Justine Greening and Justice Secretary David Lidington. Labour MP Luciana Berger, who previously served as shadow minister for mental health, tweeted that it was a ""devastating"" judgement, while Conservative MP and former children's minister Tim Loughton said it was ""worrying"".

"Sunita Devi says the attack has left her traumatised More than 50 women in the northern Indian states of Haryana and Rajasthan have reported that they have had their hair chopped off while they were unconscious. Police are struggling to solve the mystery that is leaving women paranoid and worried, reports the BBC's Vikas Pandey. ""There was a strong flash of light that left me unconscious. An hour later, I found that my hair had also been chopped off,"" says Sunita Devi, a 53-year-old housewife from the Bhimgarh Kheri area of Gurgaon district in Haryana. The ""attack"" on Friday has left her traumatised. ""I am unable to sleep or concentrate on anything. I had read about such incidents taking place in Rajasthan, but never thought it would happen to me,"" she adds. Reports of ""phantom barbers"" first emerged in early July from Rajasthan, but a spate of similar incidents are being reported from Haryana and even the capital, Delhi. Sunita Devi lives in a close-knit community of traders and farmers. Some of her neighbours are taking it in turns to stay with her until she is able to come out of the shock. She says her attacker was an elderly man ""dressed in bright-coloured clothes"". ""I was alone on the ground floor of the house, and my daughter-in-law and grandson were upstairs when the attack happened at around 21:30,"" she says. They saw and heard nothing. Munesh Devi says there is fear in the community The mystery deepens when I ask if anybody else saw the attacker. Sunita Devi's neighbour Munesh Devi says that the narrow lane, which has around 20 houses, is usually buzzing between 21:00 and 22:00. ""People get together after dinner to just talk and relax. Friday was no different, but none of us saw any unknown person going in or coming out of Sunita's house,"" she says. Burqas or bus seats? How a photo caused an internet stir Planetary protection officer wanted, generous salary Diner grants dying US woman's last wish And it didn't end there. Just a few yards away, homemaker Asha Devi lost her hair in a similar attack the following day. But this time the attacker was reportedly a woman. Asha Devi's father-in-law, Suraj Pal, says that following the incident, he sent her and other women of his family to a relative's house in Uttar Pradesh state. ""They were so paranoid after the attack, I told them to be away for a few weeks. There is fear in the community,"" he says. Mr Pal says he was at home when Asha Devi went outside to complete a household chore at around 22:00. ""I went outside to find her when she didn't return for more than 30 minutes. We found her unconscious in the bathroom. Her hair was chopped and thrown on the floor,"" he says. Attacks have also taken place in Delhi He adds that Asha gained consciousness after an hour and told him that a woman had attacked her. ""She told me that everything happened in less than 10 seconds,"" he says. I found similar cases in rural areas of Rewari district - around 70km (43 miles) from Gurgaon. These are a few: Reena Devi, 28, from Jonawasa village says she was attacked on Thursday. And the attacker seems to be a cat this time. ""I was doing my chores when I saw a large figure that resembled a cat. Then I felt somebody touching my shoulders, and that's the last thing I remember,"" she says. She agrees that her ""story is hard to believe"". ""I know it sounds impossible. But that's what I saw. Some people say I cut my hair, but why would I do that?"" she asks. In the neighbouring village of Kharkharra, Sundar Devi, 60, has been bedridden since she was attacked on Saturday. ""I was going to a neighbour's house when somebody tapped my shoulder from behind. When I looked back, there was nobody. That's the last thing I remember,"" she says. Reema Devi, 28, says her hair was chopped off while she was playing a game on her phone on Thursday. ""My husband and children were also in the room. I felt a pull on my hair and when I looked back, my hair was on the floor,"" she says. Gurgaon police spokesperson Ravinder Kumar says that the complaints are being investigated. ""These are bizarre cases. We have found no clues at crime scenes, medical tests of the victims show nothing abnormal,"" he said, adding that nobody has seen the alleged attackers. Mr Kumar adds that police from different districts are coordinating efforts to ""make some sense"" of these incidents. ""Only the victims say that they have seen or felt the presence of attackers. We will get to the bottom of these cases, but until then, I urge people to not believe in rumours,"" he says. Sundar Devi, 60, has been bedridden since she was attacked on Saturday Women in some parts of Delhi have been using bands containing pictures of gods to protect their hair And rumours are not in short supply. As I travelled from one village to another, I was given different theories for the attacks. In one village, an elderly man told me that an organised gang was involved.  Another said he believed that tantriks, or so-called witch doctors, were behind the attacks because people went to them for treatment in such scenarios. One woman insisted ""supernatural forces"" were involved.  Others accused the ""victims"" of cutting their hair to get attention. Rationalist Sanal Edamaruku told the BBC that he believed that these cases were a classic example of ""mass hysteria"". ""There is no miracle or supernatural force behind all this. Women who have reported these cases must be going through some internal psychological conflict."" he says. ""When they hear about such incidents, they end up replicating it - sometimes even subconsciously."" But Reena Devi disagrees. ""I spent years growing my hair and it made me happy. And now that it's gone, you can't even imagine my pain. It's ridiculous to say that women are chopping off their own hair,"" she says. In the mid-1990s, millions of Hindus around the world were gripped by reports in Delhi of sacred statues ""drinking"" milk. In the early morning of 21 September 1995, rumours of the elephant-headed deity Ganesha sipping milk from a spoon spread across the country. Offering food and drink like milk to the gods is an integral part of Hindu rituals. In 2001, ""a monkey-man"" reportedly attacked hundreds of people in Delhi. Reports later suggested it was  case of mass hysteria. Thousands started travelling to a popular beach in Mumbai in 2006 after rumours that the sea water had miraculously turned sweet.

"The film, England Is Mine, ends when The Smiths were born As subjects for music biopics go, there can be few trickier than Morrissey, the idolised, enigmatic, prickly former frontman of The Smiths. However, that reputation did not deter an Oscar-nominated film-maker who grew up down the road from the singer. Morrissey has a funny place in British culture - he's an aloof national treasure whose melodramatic croon and pithy pop poetry are burned into the hearts of millions, yet whose hallowed status has been somewhat eroded in recent years thanks to his outspoken online rants. Despite all that, there are plenty of people who are wary of an attempt to tell his story in fictionalised form, who are fiercely protective of him and his band, and who see it as sacred ground. ""I just have to ignore them,"" says Mark Gill, who has directed and co-written England Is Mine, the movie about the singer's pre-fame years. This video can not be played England Is Mine: Morrissey's early life explored Gill grew up less than a mile from Morrissey's house in Stretford, Manchester, and, like countless other 1980s music fans, was ""obsessed"" with The Smiths. So he was desperate to be the one to tell Morrissey's story. ""I wanted to make this film and I was determined that if anyone was going to cock it up, it would be me."" England Is Mine follows Morrissey from moping mop-topped teenager to bequiffed budding idol. It ends when he meets future bandmate Johnny Marr. The consensus seems to be that Gill hasn't cocked it up, while the director says he thinks he has created ""something really special"". Gill became a fan of The Smiths after being given their first LP at the age of 15. But his dad wouldn't let his teenage son travel into Manchester to see them live before they split up in 1987. ""My dad loathes The Smiths,"" he says. ""He absolutely cannot stand them. He used to come in and say, 'Turn that off.'"" The film ends when Morrissey (Jack Lowden, left) meets Johnny Marr (Laurie Kynaston) So what does Mr Gill senior make of the fact his son has directed his debut feature film about them? ""Who knows what he thinks. He probably thinks, when am I going to stop with this band?"" The release of England Is Mine comes three years after Gill and producing partner Baldwin Liwere nominated for an Oscarfor best live action short. Gill says he and England Is Mine co-writer William Thacker tried to strip away the persona that Morrissey has created since finding fame. Scottish actor Lowden plays the young Steven Patrick Morrissey It is a remarkable transformation for Lowden, who plays a Spitfire pilot on Dunkirk ""We wanted to make him just a very human character,"" the director says. ""I kept saying we weren't making a film about Morrissey. ""It was about this young kid, and despite the fact he goes on to be somebody of great importance artistically, he did start out as a normal teenage kid going through the same sort of stuff that the rest of us have gone through. ""In a sense it relieved us all of that pressure of making a film about an icon, because we weren't. He goes on to do that. To me, the more interesting thing was the journey towards that. ""I grew up in Stretford in the '80s and it wasn't a ghetto by any stretch of the imagination, but if you were slightly different, the pack closes in on you. ""And Morrissey was very different, 10 years previously. So I often think, how did he survive?"" Downton Abbey's Jessica Brown Findlay plays Morrissey's friend Linder Sterling Steven Patrick Morrissey is played by Jack Lowden, who can also be seen currently in a very different role - that of a World War II Spitfire pilot in Christopher Nolan's Dunkirk. At 27, Lowden was born three years after The Smiths split up and was not a particular fan before he landed this role. ""Obviously I knew of him and I knew the reputation he had of being quite morose,"" Lowden says. ""And the script was so funny for me that I thought, we have to go for this."" It was ""freeing"" to think only about those early years and not the singer's later image, the actor says. ""You cannot play a guy in the early part of his life if you're constantly aware of what he went on to become. And I think it did help that I was a Smiths virgin."" Director Mark Gill: ""You don't have to be into The Smiths and Morrissey. But it helps."" Gill says he has not been in touch with the real Morrissey directly, but that the film-makers have ""done everything we can to be respectful"". He says: ""We don't want to upset him. And you'll see it's not that type of film."" In recent years, Morrissey's most prominent forays into the public eye have been in the form of outspoken interviews and blogs. As well as his zealous protection of animal rights - his favourite subject - he also raised eyebrows with comments about politics, the royal family, the media and Islam. To some his candid views are refreshing. Others find him increasingly unsavoury. Much of the film was shot on location in Stretford ""You can separate the person from the art I think,"" Gill says when asked what he thinks of Morrissey now. ""He says some things which you just laugh out loud at and there are other things I don't agree with, but that's the same with anybody. ""But one thing I do like about him is that he is one of the only artists who has consistently remained authentic. I don't see any difference between some of the things he says now and some of the things he said in The Smiths. ""His views may have hardened or softened in certain directions, but nowadays it's incredibly rare for somebody like that to speak his mind. Who else does that? Nobody."" So what if Morrissey launches one of his famous tirades against this new film and its makers? ""I'll frame it,"" Gill replies with a smile. ""Nothing's going to change - the film's coming out. ""It would have been nice to have a conversation directly to say, 'This is what I'm doing. Trust me.'"" England Is Mine is out in the UK on 4 August.

"Naweed Ali, Khobaib Hussain and Mohibur Rahman were sentenced at the Old Bailey Three would-be jihadists who dubbed themselves the Three Musketeers have been jailed for life for plotting an attack on a police or military target. Naweed Ali, 29, Khobaib Hussain, 25, both of Sparkhill, Birmingham, and Mohibur Rahman, 33, of Stoke-on-Trent, had planned a ""mass casualty attack"". Tahir Aziz, 38, also from Stoke, was given a life term for the same crime. Old Bailey judge Mr Justice Globe said the men were gripped by a ""long-standing, radical, violent ideology"". When police arrested the four men in August last year they found weapons including a meat cleaver and a partially constructed pipe bomb. Inside the sting that caught four jihadis Ali, Hussain and Rahman - who called themselves the Three Musketeers in group messages - were each sentenced to a minimum of 20 years in prison. All three refused to attend court. They have all previously served prison sentences for terrorism offences. Aziz, who joined the group days before the arrests. was sentenced to a minimum term of 15 years in prison. Tahir Aziz, 38, from Stoke-on-Trent, was sentenced to a minimum term of 15 years Mr Justice Globe said he was satisfied it was only because of the work of undercover police and the security services that a terrorist attack ""involving a considerable loss of life"" was stopped. The purpose of the planned attack was ""to kill or injure and cause terror"" and ""to promote an anti-Western ideology,"" he said. Police say the men, who had pleaded not guilty, had been inspired by so-called Islamic State, also known as Daesh. The four men were arrested on 26 August last year after counter-terrorism officers set up a fake courier firm, called Hero Couriers, where Hussain and Ali were offered driving shifts. When Ali arrived for his first shift at the fake Birmingham depot MI5 officers secretly searched his Seat Leon car. Inside they found a JD Sports bag containing the partially-constructed pipe bomb and meat cleaver with the word ""kafir"" - meaning non-believer - scratched on it. An imitation gun, cartridges, a 9mm bullet, latex gloves and industrial tape were also recovered, while a samurai-style sword was found in Aziz's car. Police found a meat cleaver with the word Kafir scratched on it Police said the men had looked at violent material online, joined extremist social media groups and bought new mobile phones to help them further their plans. They used a Three Musketeers image from the Disney cartoon as a logo on encrypted Telegram messages sent between them. The court heard how neighbours Ali and Hussain had previously been jailed for terrorism offences. They had attempted to join an al-Qaeda training camp in Pakistan in 2011. However, when they arrived back in the UK they were arrested and the following year both pleaded guilty to engaging in conduct in preparation of terrorist acts. The pair first met Rahman - who had been convicted of possessing an al-Qaeda magazine - while in prison. During the four-and-a-half-month trial, the defence claimed incriminating evidence had been planted by an undercover officer, known as ""Vincent"", who posed as the boss of the fake courier firm. In a statement issued after sentencing, a solicitor representing Ali and Hussain raised questions about whether officers had kept their police notebooks up to date, saying she was concerned the jury had ""got it wrong."" Gareth Peirce said there was a ""clear distortion of the normal criminal justice process"" in the case, which was partly held in secret and saw some officers give evidence anonymously. She drew parallels with the Birmingham Six, in which a group of Irish men were wrongly convicted of bombing two pubs in 1974. Officers covertly photographed the men meeting in August last year However, the jury rejected the defence's claim that Vincent had planted the cleaver and the pipe bomb in Ali's car. Sentencing the men, Judge Globe rejected the claims as ""totally unfounded"". He said there had been ""a root and branch attack on the credibility of just about every prosecution witness in the case"". Detective Chief Superintendent Matt Ward, head of the West Midlands Counter Terrorism Unit, said the sentences reflected ""the level of danger that these four men represented to the public"". ""They were committed to carrying out an attack which would have undoubtedly resulted in loss of life,"" he said. ""This is the second time three of these individuals have been convicted of terrorism offences after planning an attack. ""Although much work is being done in prisons and following the release of individuals it is clear that more needs to be done.""

"Most parents say they keep their young children's photos off social networks Parents are divided about whether it is right to post photos of one's children to social media, according to a study by the UK's communications watchdog. Ofcom reported,externalthat just over half of parents it surveyed said they avoided what it termed ""sharenting"" altogether. A desire to protect the privacy of under-18s was the most commonly given reason, it said. But about one in five parents said they posted such images at least once a month, the regulator added. The figures are contained in the organisation's annual Communications Market Report. It is based on an online survey of 1,000 adults carried out in April by YouGov. Ofcom suggested that posting family videos and photos to social media had become a ""Marmite issue"" - a reference to the opinion-splitting food spread. ""Parents are really divided about whether it's sensible to share photos of their children online,"" Ofcom's consumer group director Lindsey Fussell told the BBC. ""The good news is that of those who do share, over 80% feel very confident about restricting who can see those photos... to friends and family, for example."" Of the abstainers, 87% said their offspring's lives should remain private, and 38% said their children would not want them to upload the material. But 52% of the sharers said their children were happy for photos and videos of themselves to be online, and only 15% had concerns about what their children might think when they grew up. Is too much TV making you tired? Most parents who shared photos of their children said they used only shots the youngsters would be happy with Most of those questioned acknowledged that they tended to accept social media and messaging apps' terms and conditions  without reading them, and half acknowledged it was not always easy to erase imagery from the net once it had been uploaded. In light of the findings, the NSPCC children's charity urged parents to carefully consider the issues involved. ""Each time a photo or video is uploaded, it creates a digital footprint of a child which can follow them into adult life,"" said a spokeswoman. ""It is always important to ask a child for their permission before posting photos or videos of them. ""For very young children, think about whether they would be happy for you to post or if it will embarrass them. If you aren't sure, it's best not to post."" The study also examined the care people took over the images they upload of themselves. On average, it said, respondents took six photos of themselves for every selfie that they posted. Moreover, it said, the popularity of filters in Instagram, Snapchat and Facebook as well as a plethora of face-enhancement apps had helped encourage nearly half of all selfie-snappers to take over a minute to edit the pictures before posting them. Millions skip sleep to binge-watch TV Kids see 'worrying' amount of hate online How can I keep my kids safe online? The truth behind selfies The report also pointed to a disconnect between how people felt about their own self-portraits and what they thought about others': 61% of respondents said their own images were an accurate reflection of themselves, but 74% said at times other people's presented ""rose tinted"" versions of their lives. The wide-ranging report also indicated that while there might be more Britons on YouTube (42 million) than Facebook (39.7 million), the latter appears to be more addictive. In the summer of 2016, the watchdog released a smartphone-tracking app of its own for Android devices and analysed the data generated for 1,200 volunteers. It revealed that on average the participants used Facebook's app 11.7 times a day. By contrast, the figure for YouTube was 2.6 times. Other results from the report include: tablet ownership has declined for the first time, although Ofcom cautioned that the 1% annual drop might not be statistically significant close to 40% of the under-55s now own an internet-connected TV - whether it be because it is linked up to a games console, set-top box or dongle, or because it has built-in capability. This has helped encourage Brits to ""binge"" on several episodes of the same television programme in one sitting 9% of those surveyed said they watched films and TV shows on the toilet, and a matching number said they did so in the garden Snapchat saw the biggest growth among the mainstream social networks last year. It added 3.1 million UK members to take its tally to 10.3 million.

"This video can not be played Households have cut spending since Brexit, says Bank of England's Mark Carney The governor of the Bank of England has warned that uncertainty over Brexit is already weighing on the economy. Mark Carney's comments came as the Bank voted to hold rates and cut growth forecasts. It edged this year's growth forecast down to 1.7% from its previous forecast of 1.9% made in May. It also cut its forecast for 2018 from 1.7% to 1.6%. Sterling dropped to a nine-month low against the euro after the downward revision to the growth forecasts. The pound fell about 0.76% to 1.1063 euros. The bank voted 6-2 to keep interest rates on hold at 0.25%. They have been at that level since August last year. Mr Carney said that business investment was slower than it would have been expected to be because of Brexit. ""It's evident in our discussions across the country with businesses,"" he said, ""that uncertainties about the eventual relationship are weighing on the decisions of some businesses."" He said that investment had been weaker than otherwise would have been expected ""in a very strong world"" and the consequences of that was starting to build: ""The speed limit of the economy, if you will, has slowed."" Mr Carney said the Bank expected business investment to pick up from its current ""very subdued"" levels, but that it was still below historic rates. He added that Brexit uncertainty was also hitting pay negotiations. ""There is an element of Brexit uncertainty which is affecting the wage bargaining. Some firms, potentially a material number of firms, are less willing to give bigger pay rises given that it is not as clear what their market access is going to be over the course of the next few years,"" he said. Former British Chambers of Commerce director general and co-chairman of pro-Brexit lobby group Leave Means Leave, John Longworth, said he agreed that business confidence is ""lower than it ought to be"". Mr Longworth added that Bank of England was ""notoriously bad at forecasting"", so ""we should always take it with a pinch of salt"". Analysis: BBC business editor Simon Jack The big squeeze on incomes will get tighter from here and will last longer than previously thought. At the moment, prices are rising 2.6% while wages are rising just 2%. That gap is expected to widen later this year. Inflation is expected to peak at about 3% in October, as the surge in import prices caused by the post-Brexit-referendum drop in the pound continues to feed through to shop prices. When prices rise faster than wages, we get poorer on average every day. This explains why the Bank cut its forecast for economic growth for this year and next. It is also the main reason why the Bank of England has decided - for the 120th month in a row - not to raise interest rates. Read more here FTSE rises on Bank move Simon Jack: Wage squeeze to get tighter The Bank is also now gloomier on prospects for wage growth and thinks wages will grow by 3% in 2018, down from the 3.5% estimate it made in May. Weak wage growth, combined with rising inflation, has been weighing on the spending power of households. There has not been an interest rate rise since July 2007. Many economists think the UK could see a move this year and recent speeches by Bank officials have raised that expectation. Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) member Andrew Haldane recently said an increase might be ""prudent"" in the second half of this year. The bank highlighted that the 18% fall in the pound since November 2015 has been raising the price of imports for the UK, which in turn has been making life more expensive for consumers. Shoppers may have noticed significant increases in the prices of items such as butter, meat and computer software. The bank also said there had been evidence that spending on cars, home wares and electrical goods had been falling. It also noted weakness in the housing market and a fall in consumer confidence, which it thinks could indicate that households will curb their spending in the months to come. The bank expects wage growth of just 2% this year, which is well below price inflation, currently running at 2.6%. To help bridge the gap between weak wage growth and inflation, consumers have been borrowing more, aided by low rates. In its report, the Bank said that interest rates on a Â£10,000 personal loan were close to record lows. Bank officials have been expressing concern about household debt. Last week, Alex Brazier, the financial stability director, warned that High Street banks risked entering a ""spiral of complacency"" over mounting consumer debt. Members of the MPC also voted in favour of extending a credit facility to British banks from Â£100bn to Â£115bn. The so-called Term Funding Scheme (TFS) runs until February 2018 and has already lent Â£78bn to banks at close to the bank's base rate of 0.25%. The TFS is backed by the Treasury.

"Ian Paterson has had his jail sentence increased from 15 to 20 years by Court of Appeal judges A breast surgeon who intentionally wounded his patients has had his 15-year jail term increased to 20 years. Ian Paterson, 59, who appeared at the Court of Appeal via video link, was told his current sentence was ""not sufficient"" to reflect the seriousness and the totality of his offending. Paterson was found guilty in April at Nottingham Crown Court of 17 counts of wounding with intent. Jurors also convicted him of three further wounding charges. Explaining the decision to increase his jail term, one of the three Appeal Court judges - Lady Justice Hallett - told Paterson his victims had been, ""left feeling violated and vulnerable"". She described his treatment of patients as ""brutal and sustained"". ""They have lost their trust in others, particularly some in the medical profession,"" she said. This video can not be played Victim Debbie Douglas: ""I didn't think I'd be so emotional"" ""Some have experienced long-term psychological effects."" Representing Paterson, Nicholas Johnson QC said ""his crimes are truly notorious"". He said in prison the surgeon was regarded as a ""marked man"" so had to be kept apart from other inmates. Surgeon 'psychopathic like Shipman' 'He took a pound of flesh for money' That decision has been met with some satisfaction by Ian Paterson's victims who have come to the Court of Appeal today. They were hoping for at least 20 years when he was sentenced to 15 years in Nottingham at the end of May. They felt that day, that whilst they were glad he had gone to prison, that he should have been sent to prison for longer. Paterson has appeared via video link from Nottingham Prison. He was taking notes and shaking his head occasionally. Lady Justice Hallett said the Appeal Court judges had to impose a ""just and proportionate sentence"". The judges found the exercise difficult but they did think the original sentence had been unduly lenient. They said there had been a breach of trust and an abuse of power and took into account the vulnerability of the patients - some of whom were under his care for a decade or more. She said ultimately the 15-year sentence just was not long enough, given the totality of all of those factors. Paterson, of Altrincham, Greater Manchester, wasjailed in Mayfollowing an eight-week trial trial. This video can not be played What is cleavage-sparing surgery? The court heard from nine women and one man who were treated in the private sector at Little Aston and Parkway Hospitals, run by Spire Healthcare, in the West Midlands between 1997 and 2011. However the case was referred to the Court of Appeal by Solicitor General Robert Buckland. Mr Buckland argued that Paterson's offending was ""so serious and so exceptional"" that a jail term ""significantly higher"" than 15 years was required. This video can not be played Solicitor General Robert Buckland says Ian Paterson ""systematically mutilated"" vulnerable victims The trial heard Paterson, who treated thousands of patients during his career, exaggerated or invented cancer risks and claimed payments for more expensive procedures in some cases. Jurors were not told Paterson also carried out hundreds of unnecessary operations on NHS patients, with a hospital trust paying out Â£17.8m in damages and legal costs. In October, more than 500 of Paterson's private patients who had unnecessary operations will seek compensation at the High Court. Paterson was found guilty of wounding patients at Spire private hospitals Linda Millband from Thompsons Solicitors, which is representing them, said: ""Many of our clients were subjected to significant harm at the hands of Mr Paterson and some have been left with life-long conditions. ""While no length of sentence can undo this harm, it seems right and fair that this otherwise lenient sentence was revised, and extended by the courts."" Diane Green, who was given two unnecessary double mastectomies by Ian Paterson, said: ""I lost everything - my home, my job, my marriage - as a result of what that man did. ""While no amount of jail time can repay or make up for what he did, a sentence 15 years... was never going to be enough for maiming and butchering hundreds of women like me."" ""It is encouraging to see the Court of Appeal listening to victims like me and extending the sentence to 20 years.""

"Orange is the New Black was the top show on streaming services at the end of 2016 About 10 million Britons have skipped sleep or made themselves tired the next day because they were binge-watching TV, new research suggests. More than half of British adults watch more than one episode of the same show back-to-back at least once a month. Of those, a third - almost 10 million - admit they have missed sleep or become tired as a result, while a quarter say they have neglected household chores. Media watchdog Ofcom did the research into what it called ""box set Britain"". Scott Bryan, TV editor at BuzzFeed UK, thinks it's simply down to people being unable to resist temptation. ""The old days of having a TV schedule that used to dictate when the drama started and ended is long gone,"" he told the BBC. ""Now it's hard not to follow on that temptation, especially when the next episodes are available straight away.""

The days of waiting a week for the next episode are largely gone, with people finding it hard to resist watching multiple episodes around the house or on the move. ""But live television still has a special draw, and the power to bring the whole family together in a common experience."" Social media is another reason why Scott Bryan believes live TV will continue to draw in viewers. ""The Great British Bake Off and Twitter were perfect companions as people were using it for jokes and references,"" he said. ""That commentary was like watching it with a mate.""

"Naweed Ali, Khobaib Hussain and Mohibur Rahman were sentenced at the Old Bailey Three would-be jihadists who dubbed themselves the Three Musketeers have been jailed for life for plotting an attack on a police or military target. Naweed Ali, 29, Khobaib Hussain, 25, both of Sparkhill, Birmingham, and Mohibur Rahman, 33, of Stoke-on-Trent, had planned a ""mass casualty attack"". Tahir Aziz, 38, also from Stoke, was given a life term for the same crime. Old Bailey judge Mr Justice Globe said the men were gripped by a ""long-standing, radical, violent ideology"". When police arrested the four men in August last year they found weapons including a meat cleaver and a partially constructed pipe bomb. Inside the sting that caught four jihadis Ali, Hussain and Rahman - who called themselves the Three Musketeers in group messages - were each sentenced to a minimum of 20 years in prison. All three refused to attend court. They have all previously served prison sentences for terrorism offences. Aziz, who joined the group days before the arrests. was sentenced to a minimum term of 15 years in prison. Tahir Aziz, 38, from Stoke-on-Trent, was sentenced to a minimum term of 15 years Mr Justice Globe said he was satisfied it was only because of the work of undercover police and the security services that a terrorist attack ""involving a considerable loss of life"" was stopped. The purpose of the planned attack was ""to kill or injure and cause terror"" and ""to promote an anti-Western ideology,"" he said. Police say the men, who had pleaded not guilty, had been inspired by so-called Islamic State, also known as Daesh. The four men were arrested on 26 August last year after counter-terrorism officers set up a fake courier firm, called Hero Couriers, where Hussain and Ali were offered driving shifts. When Ali arrived for his first shift at the fake Birmingham depot MI5 officers secretly searched his Seat Leon car. Inside they found a JD Sports bag containing the partially-constructed pipe bomb and meat cleaver with the word ""kafir"" - meaning non-believer - scratched on it. An imitation gun, cartridges, a 9mm bullet, latex gloves and industrial tape were also recovered, while a samurai-style sword was found in Aziz's car. Police found a meat cleaver with the word Kafir scratched on it Police said the men had looked at violent material online, joined extremist social media groups and bought new mobile phones to help them further their plans. They used a Three Musketeers image from the Disney cartoon as a logo on encrypted Telegram messages sent between them. The court heard how neighbours Ali and Hussain had previously been jailed for terrorism offences. They had attempted to join an al-Qaeda training camp in Pakistan in 2011. However, when they arrived back in the UK they were arrested and the following year both pleaded guilty to engaging in conduct in preparation of terrorist acts. The pair first met Rahman - who had been convicted of possessing an al-Qaeda magazine - while in prison. During the four-and-a-half-month trial, the defence claimed incriminating evidence had been planted by an undercover officer, known as ""Vincent"", who posed as the boss of the fake courier firm. In a statement issued after sentencing, a solicitor representing Ali and Hussain raised questions about whether officers had kept their police notebooks up to date, saying she was concerned the jury had ""got it wrong."" Gareth Peirce said there was a ""clear distortion of the normal criminal justice process"" in the case, which was partly held in secret and saw some officers give evidence anonymously. She drew parallels with the Birmingham Six, in which a group of Irish men were wrongly convicted of bombing two pubs in 1974. Officers covertly photographed the men meeting in August last year However, the jury rejected the defence's claim that Vincent had planted the cleaver and the pipe bomb in Ali's car. Sentencing the men, Judge Globe rejected the claims as ""totally unfounded"". He said there had been ""a root and branch attack on the credibility of just about every prosecution witness in the case"". Detective Chief Superintendent Matt Ward, head of the West Midlands Counter Terrorism Unit, said the sentences reflected ""the level of danger that these four men represented to the public"". ""They were committed to carrying out an attack which would have undoubtedly resulted in loss of life,"" he said. ""This is the second time three of these individuals have been convicted of terrorism offences after planning an attack. ""Although much work is being done in prisons and following the release of individuals it is clear that more needs to be done.""

"This video can not be played The Lullaby Trust's Francine Bates says baby boxes are not as good as cots or Moses baskets A cot death charity has raised doubts over the benefits of Finnish-style baby boxes, which infants can sleep in. Issuing new advice to parents, The Lullaby Trust said there was no evidence baby boxes reduced the rate of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). The cardboard box, filled with baby products and a mattress, can itself be used as a bed, and has been given to new parents by some NHS trusts. The charity said its leaflets would no longer be put in the boxes. ""We will no longer allow our branded leaflets to be enclosed...as this suggests we endorse the product,"" said the charity, which provides expert advice on safer baby sleep for the NHS. The box tradition originates from Finland, where for 75 years, every pregnant woman has been given a box filled with things like nappies, clothes, bedding and a mattress. Do baby boxes really save lives? Why Finnish babies sleep in cardboard boxes Why babies all over the world are now sleeping in boxes Finland has one of the lowest infant mortality rates in the world - two deaths per 1,000 live births, compared with a global rate of 32 in 1,000, according to the UN. Francine Bates, chief executive of the Lullaby Trust, told BBC Radio 5 live Finland's ""fantastic record"" was due to a variety of reasons, including lower teenage pregnancy rates. She said: ""The fact that they give a box out to every family may be a factor but we can't say that definitively."" Miia's son slept in his baby box until he outgrew it at five months old Miia, 40, and her partner Tim, from Reading, were sent a baby box by her Finnish mother when their son was born eight months ago. She told the BBC: ""It's quite a traditional thing. I slept in one myself. You get a box full of baby clothes from newborn to one years old. ""The idea is that you get the basics so you don't have to buy any more. You also get toys and toothbrushes and all sorts of other things. ""A foam mattress is included so you can use it as a box to sleep in. We ended up using it until he was about five months old. ""We kept the box on the floor next to the bed on my side. He was happy and I think he felt quite safe in it. I was quite reluctant to move him away from it. ""But when he got bigger he started to wake himself up knocking against the side of the box. It was getting a bit snug."" A box scheme is due to berolled out for all newborn babies across Scotlandthis month. Some areas in England also give out boxes. A spokesperson for the Scottish government said it was ""proud"" to introduce the box in Scotland, where it will ""help tackle deprivation, improve health and support parents"". They said the Scottish baby box meets the ""highest safety standards"", adding: ""It was awarded British Safety Standard accreditation as a crib for domestic use - the first non-commercial baby box in the world to do so.""

""We're very clear that a cot or a Moses basket is the safest place for a baby to sleep,"" she said, adding that she was concerned the boxes were being marketed as products to reduce sudden infant death syndrome.

"This video can not be played All you need to know about the Trump-Russia investigation Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev has said new sanctions imposed by the US are tantamount to declaring a ""full-scale trade war"" against Moscow. He said the measures, signed by Donald Trump, demonstrated the complete impotence of the US president, who he said had been humiliated by Congress. The law aims to punish Russia for its alleged meddling in the 2016 US elections and its actions in Ukraine. Mr Trump accused Congress of overreach on the legislation. In signing the Countering America's Adversaries Through Sanctions Act on Wednesday, he attached a statement calling the measure ""deeply flawed"". The legislation limits the amount of money Americans can invest in Russian energy projects, and makes it more difficult for US companies to do business with Russia. It also imposes sanctions on Iran and North Korea. Iran said the new sanctions violated the nuclear deal and it would respond in an ""appropriate and proportional"" manner, reports the semi-official Isna news agency. North Korea has so far made no public comments on the US move. The Trump-Russia saga in 200 words Reality Check: What are the sanctions against Russia? Writing on his Facebook page,externalon Wednesday, Mr Medvedev said the sanctions package ""ends hopes for improving our relations with the new US administration. ""The sanctions regime has been codified and will remain in effect for decades unless a miracle happens."" Dmitry Medvedev said Russia would ""calmly"" continue to develop its economy, despite the sanctions Mr Medvedev also warned that the US Congress would take new steps aimed at removing President Trump - whom he described as a ""non-systemic player"" - from power. Moscow - which denies interfering in the US presidential election - had already retaliated last week when Congress passed the bill by ordering the US to cut to 455 the number of staff at the US embassy and consulates in Russia - a reduction of 755 people altogether - and also by denying access to a US country house and a warehouse in Moscow. Several European nations, including Germany, had been fearful of the economic consequences butEuropean Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker expressed satisfaction,externalover what he described as the softening of the bill after the EU had expressed its concerns. ""Moreover, the US Congress has now also committed to only apply sanctions after the country's allies are consulted. And I do believe we are still allies of the US,"" he said. President Trump has repeatedly rejected any allegations that his campaign staff colluded with Russia to help him win. And he accused Congress, which last week overwhelmingly passed the bill and sent it to the White House, of overstepping its constitutional authority. ""As president, I can make far better deals with foreign countries than Congress,"" he said. Allegations by the US intelligence community that Russia interfered in the US election to aid Mr Trump are currently being investigated by Congress and a special investigator. Anthony Zurcher, BBC News, Washington Donald Trump has signed the bill but he's clearly not happy about it. Hardly surprising, as any president would probably object to congressional efforts to curtail executive power included in this legislation. As is becoming routine, however, this administration didn't draw its battle lines in the expected way. There were several ""signing statements"". The first reads like a standard legalistic description of a presidential action with a bevy of ""yes, but..."" reservations. Another statement is decidedly more Trumpian, complete with a shot at Congress for not passing healthcare reform and a closing boast about his business empire and negotiating prowess. Releasing multiple signing statements with somewhat divergent tones is unusual, to say the least, and could be an indication that, despite the efforts of new chief of staff John Kelly, the administration is still not speaking with a unified voice. The sanctions, which are also in response to Russia's annexation of Crimea, come months after former US President Barack Obama expelled 35 Russian diplomats. Russia: The 'cloud' over the White House Why are so many US diplomats in Russia? Republican Lindsey Graham praised the bill after it passed, pointing out that Mr Trump's options were limited since there were enough votes to overcome a presidential veto. ""President Putin did something that nobody in America could do. He united the Congress,"" the South Carolina senator told CNN. Senior Russian parliamentarian Konstantin Kosachev said that Mr Trump was ""capitulating"" by not standing up to Congress.

"Naweed Ali, Khobaib Hussain and Mohibur Rahman were sentenced at the Old Bailey Three would-be jihadists who dubbed themselves the Three Musketeers have been jailed for life for plotting an attack on a police or military target. Naweed Ali, 29, Khobaib Hussain, 25, both of Sparkhill, Birmingham, and Mohibur Rahman, 33, of Stoke-on-Trent, had planned a ""mass casualty attack"". Tahir Aziz, 38, also from Stoke, was given a life term for the same crime. Old Bailey judge Mr Justice Globe said the men were gripped by a ""long-standing, radical, violent ideology"". When police arrested the four men in August last year they found weapons including a meat cleaver and a partially constructed pipe bomb. Inside the sting that caught four jihadis Ali, Hussain and Rahman - who called themselves the Three Musketeers in group messages - were each sentenced to a minimum of 20 years in prison. All three refused to attend court. They have all previously served prison sentences for terrorism offences. Aziz, who joined the group days before the arrests. was sentenced to a minimum term of 15 years in prison. Tahir Aziz, 38, from Stoke-on-Trent, was sentenced to a minimum term of 15 years Mr Justice Globe said he was satisfied it was only because of the work of undercover police and the security services that a terrorist attack ""involving a considerable loss of life"" was stopped. The purpose of the planned attack was ""to kill or injure and cause terror"" and ""to promote an anti-Western ideology,"" he said. Police say the men, who had pleaded not guilty, had been inspired by so-called Islamic State, also known as Daesh. The four men were arrested on 26 August last year after counter-terrorism officers set up a fake courier firm, called Hero Couriers, where Hussain and Ali were offered driving shifts. When Ali arrived for his first shift at the fake Birmingham depot MI5 officers secretly searched his Seat Leon car. Inside they found a JD Sports bag containing the partially-constructed pipe bomb and meat cleaver with the word ""kafir"" - meaning non-believer - scratched on it. An imitation gun, cartridges, a 9mm bullet, latex gloves and industrial tape were also recovered, while a samurai-style sword was found in Aziz's car. Police found a meat cleaver with the word Kafir scratched on it Police said the men had looked at violent material online, joined extremist social media groups and bought new mobile phones to help them further their plans. They used a Three Musketeers image from the Disney cartoon as a logo on encrypted Telegram messages sent between them. The court heard how neighbours Ali and Hussain had previously been jailed for terrorism offences. They had attempted to join an al-Qaeda training camp in Pakistan in 2011. However, when they arrived back in the UK they were arrested and the following year both pleaded guilty to engaging in conduct in preparation of terrorist acts. The pair first met Rahman - who had been convicted of possessing an al-Qaeda magazine - while in prison. During the four-and-a-half-month trial, the defence claimed incriminating evidence had been planted by an undercover officer, known as ""Vincent"", who posed as the boss of the fake courier firm. In a statement issued after sentencing, a solicitor representing Ali and Hussain raised questions about whether officers had kept their police notebooks up to date, saying she was concerned the jury had ""got it wrong."" Gareth Peirce said there was a ""clear distortion of the normal criminal justice process"" in the case, which was partly held in secret and saw some officers give evidence anonymously. She drew parallels with the Birmingham Six, in which a group of Irish men were wrongly convicted of bombing two pubs in 1974. Officers covertly photographed the men meeting in August last year However, the jury rejected the defence's claim that Vincent had planted the cleaver and the pipe bomb in Ali's car. Sentencing the men, Judge Globe rejected the claims as ""totally unfounded"". He said there had been ""a root and branch attack on the credibility of just about every prosecution witness in the case"". Detective Chief Superintendent Matt Ward, head of the West Midlands Counter Terrorism Unit, said the sentences reflected ""the level of danger that these four men represented to the public"". ""They were committed to carrying out an attack which would have undoubtedly resulted in loss of life,"" he said. ""This is the second time three of these individuals have been convicted of terrorism offences after planning an attack. ""Although much work is being done in prisons and following the release of individuals it is clear that more needs to be done.""

"This video can not be played The Lullaby Trust's Francine Bates says baby boxes are not as good as cots or Moses baskets A cot death charity has raised doubts over the benefits of Finnish-style baby boxes, which infants can sleep in. Issuing new advice to parents, The Lullaby Trust said there was no evidence baby boxes reduced the rate of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). The cardboard box, filled with baby products and a mattress, can itself be used as a bed, and has been given to new parents by some NHS trusts. The charity said its leaflets would no longer be put in the boxes. ""We will no longer allow our branded leaflets to be enclosed...as this suggests we endorse the product,"" said the charity, which provides expert advice on safer baby sleep for the NHS. The box tradition originates from Finland, where for 75 years, every pregnant woman has been given a box filled with things like nappies, clothes, bedding and a mattress. Do baby boxes really save lives? Why Finnish babies sleep in cardboard boxes Why babies all over the world are now sleeping in boxes Finland has one of the lowest infant mortality rates in the world - two deaths per 1,000 live births, compared with a global rate of 32 in 1,000, according to the UN. Francine Bates, chief executive of the Lullaby Trust, told BBC Radio 5 live Finland's ""fantastic record"" was due to a variety of reasons, including lower teenage pregnancy rates. She said: ""The fact that they give a box out to every family may be a factor but we can't say that definitively."" Miia's son slept in his baby box until he outgrew it at five months old Miia, 40, and her partner Tim, from Reading, were sent a baby box by her Finnish mother when their son was born eight months ago. She told the BBC: ""It's quite a traditional thing. I slept in one myself. You get a box full of baby clothes from newborn to one years old. ""The idea is that you get the basics so you don't have to buy any more. You also get toys and toothbrushes and all sorts of other things. ""A foam mattress is included so you can use it as a box to sleep in. We ended up using it until he was about five months old. ""We kept the box on the floor next to the bed on my side. He was happy and I think he felt quite safe in it. I was quite reluctant to move him away from it. ""But when he got bigger he started to wake himself up knocking against the side of the box. It was getting a bit snug."" A box scheme is due to berolled out for all newborn babies across Scotlandthis month. Some areas in England also give out boxes. A spokesperson for the Scottish government said it was ""proud"" to introduce the box in Scotland, where it will ""help tackle deprivation, improve health and support parents"". They said the Scottish baby box meets the ""highest safety standards"", adding: ""It was awarded British Safety Standard accreditation as a crib for domestic use - the first non-commercial baby box in the world to do so.""

"Toni was delayed in an acute unit for six months Mental health patients across the UK are spending years stranded in acute units awaiting discharge, figures show. Over the past two years, at least 91 patients have waited more than a year to be discharged, with at least seven patients waiting more than two years. At least 320 patients had to wait at least 100 days to be discharged, BBC Freedom of Information requests show. Experts say a lack of suitable accommodation and wrangling over budgets are to blame for the delays. Toni Adeniyi, 32, has spent 15 years as a mental health inpatient, suffering from emotional unstable personality disorder, and schizoaffective disorder. ""At times I wasn't well, I used to attack people, I wasn't taking my medication properly. I just wasn't allowed off the unit,"" she said. However, when Toni was ready to be released, she was stuck on an acute ward for another six months. ""I think it was due to funding, and paperwork. It was a bit frustrating,"" she said. ""I used to see other people leaving before me, and I would think, 'I've been ready a long time, and I'm more equipped', but they seemed to get out quicker."" Eventually, she was placed in mental health charity Together's supported step-down unit in Wellingborough, which helped her adjust to life outside hospital. Toni hopes to gain more independence by moving to a self-contained flat at the unit She explained that the transition to the unit, and the freedom to do little things she couldn't do while on a ward, made all the difference. ""It's doing my own cooking, doing things I want to do. ""I can have things in my room like mirrors, razors, glass and aerosols, because you are not allowed that in hospital,"" she said. In England, the longest delay recorded was 1,159 days, for a 62-year-old patient at Sussex Partnership NHS Foundation Trust. In Scotland, the longest delay recorded was 1,200 days, at NHS Lothian. In Wales, Hywel Dda health board saw a delay of 975 days, while in Northern Ireland, a 76-year-old patient was delayed for 1,235 days at the Southern Health and Social Care Trust. Due to differences in how the data is recorded, direct comparisons between delays in each nation are not possible. Sussex Partnership NHS Foundation Trust: 62-year-old awaiting a residential home, delayed by 1,159 days. Sussex Partnership NHS Foundation Trust: 60-year-old awaiting suitable housing, delayed by 868 days. Central and North West London NHS Foundation Trust: 27-year-old originally admitted to A&E, awaiting suitable supported housing. Delayed by 668 days. Pennine Care NHS Foundation Trust: 59-year-old delayed by 602 days. Essex Partnership University NHS Foundation Trust: 65-year-old awaiting a placement, delayed by 583 days. Dr Kalidindi explained that a shortage of supported accommodation could cause delayed discharges Dr Sridevi Kalidindi, of the Royal College of Psychiatrists, explained that disagreements between different health bodies over how to fund a patient's placement could lead to delay. ""Where those relationships are not quite right, where everyone feels under a lot of pressure in terms of their own finances that's often where people can disagree,"" she said. She also said the benefits cap was making it harder for providers to meet demand for accommodation for patients in the community. ""We know around the country of supported housing placements closing down as a result of this. ""We also know of supported housing that was going to come online being shelved by large housing providers who are in this space."" NHS Tayside: 29.4% Hywel Dda Health Board: 20.0% Sheffield Health and Social Care NHS Foundation Trust: 17.1% Hertfordshire Partnership University NHS Foundation Trust: 15% Kent and Medway NHS and Social Care Partnership Trust: 12.3% Thereport of the Crisp Commission,externalinto mental health care last year found one in six acute patients were clinically well enough to be discharged but could not be for other reasons. Some authorities reported as many as 29% of their acute beds being used by patients in delay on 28 February 2017. Most mental health authorities across the UK saw at least one patient delayed by six months over the period. Julie's daughter Naeema has suffered from anorexia since the age of 13 One such patient struggling to find the correct care is Naeema Austin Quiery, 16, who has suffered from anorexia nervosa for three years. Her mother, Julie Quiery, says while Naeema has been helped to keep up her weight, the underlying mental health issues have not properly been treated. ""She hasn't received the psychotherapy care that she needs in order to try and overcome her illness,"" Julie explained. Julie thinks her daughter has often been discharged too early, once her weight was restored, leading to re-admission. ""It's a very short-sighted view. Because unless you are working with the mental health, and the thoughts and behaviours around the illness, one can't work without the other."" ""It has to be a two-pronged approach"", she said. Julie says her daughter has not been receiving the psychotherapy that she needs A spokeswoman for NHS England said: ""The NHS is now increasing alternatives to hospital admissions.""

"Sunita Devi says the attack has left her traumatised More than 50 women in the northern Indian states of Haryana and Rajasthan have reported that they have had their hair chopped off while they were unconscious. Police are struggling to solve the mystery that is leaving women paranoid and worried, reports the BBC's Vikas Pandey. ""There was a strong flash of light that left me unconscious. An hour later, I found that my hair had also been chopped off,"" says Sunita Devi, a 53-year-old housewife from the Bhimgarh Kheri area of Gurgaon district in Haryana. The ""attack"" on Friday has left her traumatised. ""I am unable to sleep or concentrate on anything. I had read about such incidents taking place in Rajasthan, but never thought it would happen to me,"" she adds. Reports of ""phantom barbers"" first emerged in early July from Rajasthan, but a spate of similar incidents are being reported from Haryana and even the capital, Delhi. Sunita Devi lives in a close-knit community of traders and farmers. Some of her neighbours are taking it in turns to stay with her until she is able to come out of the shock. She says her attacker was an elderly man ""dressed in bright-coloured clothes"". ""I was alone on the ground floor of the house, and my daughter-in-law and grandson were upstairs when the attack happened at around 21:30,"" she says. They saw and heard nothing. Munesh Devi says there is fear in the community The mystery deepens when I ask if anybody else saw the attacker. Sunita Devi's neighbour Munesh Devi says that the narrow lane, which has around 20 houses, is usually buzzing between 21:00 and 22:00. ""People get together after dinner to just talk and relax. Friday was no different, but none of us saw any unknown person going in or coming out of Sunita's house,"" she says. Burqas or bus seats? How a photo caused an internet stir Planetary protection officer wanted, generous salary Diner grants dying US woman's last wish And it didn't end there. Just a few yards away, homemaker Asha Devi lost her hair in a similar attack the following day. But this time the attacker was reportedly a woman. Asha Devi's father-in-law, Suraj Pal, says that following the incident, he sent her and other women of his family to a relative's house in Uttar Pradesh state. ""They were so paranoid after the attack, I told them to be away for a few weeks. There is fear in the community,"" he says. Mr Pal says he was at home when Asha Devi went outside to complete a household chore at around 22:00. ""I went outside to find her when she didn't return for more than 30 minutes. We found her unconscious in the bathroom. Her hair was chopped and thrown on the floor,"" he says. Attacks have also taken place in Delhi He adds that Asha gained consciousness after an hour and told him that a woman had attacked her. ""She told me that everything happened in less than 10 seconds,"" he says. I found similar cases in rural areas of Rewari district - around 70km (43 miles) from Gurgaon. These are a few: Reena Devi, 28, from Jonawasa village says she was attacked on Thursday. And the attacker seems to be a cat this time. ""I was doing my chores when I saw a large figure that resembled a cat. Then I felt somebody touching my shoulders, and that's the last thing I remember,"" she says. She agrees that her ""story is hard to believe"". ""I know it sounds impossible. But that's what I saw. Some people say I cut my hair, but why would I do that?"" she asks. In the neighbouring village of Kharkharra, Sundar Devi, 60, has been bedridden since she was attacked on Saturday. ""I was going to a neighbour's house when somebody tapped my shoulder from behind. When I looked back, there was nobody. That's the last thing I remember,"" she says. Reema Devi, 28, says her hair was chopped off while she was playing a game on her phone on Thursday. ""My husband and children were also in the room. I felt a pull on my hair and when I looked back, my hair was on the floor,"" she says. Gurgaon police spokesperson Ravinder Kumar says that the complaints are being investigated. ""These are bizarre cases. We have found no clues at crime scenes, medical tests of the victims show nothing abnormal,"" he said, adding that nobody has seen the alleged attackers. Mr Kumar adds that police from different districts are coordinating efforts to ""make some sense"" of these incidents. ""Only the victims say that they have seen or felt the presence of attackers. We will get to the bottom of these cases, but until then, I urge people to not believe in rumours,"" he says. Sundar Devi, 60, has been bedridden since she was attacked on Saturday Women in some parts of Delhi have been using bands containing pictures of gods to protect their hair And rumours are not in short supply. As I travelled from one village to another, I was given different theories for the attacks. In one village, an elderly man told me that an organised gang was involved.  Another said he believed that tantriks, or so-called witch doctors, were behind the attacks because people went to them for treatment in such scenarios. One woman insisted ""supernatural forces"" were involved.  Others accused the ""victims"" of cutting their hair to get attention. Rationalist Sanal Edamaruku told the BBC that he believed that these cases were a classic example of ""mass hysteria"". ""There is no miracle or supernatural force behind all this. Women who have reported these cases must be going through some internal psychological conflict."" he says. ""When they hear about such incidents, they end up replicating it - sometimes even subconsciously."" But Reena Devi disagrees. ""I spent years growing my hair and it made me happy. And now that it's gone, you can't even imagine my pain. It's ridiculous to say that women are chopping off their own hair,"" she says. In the mid-1990s, millions of Hindus around the world were gripped by reports in Delhi of sacred statues ""drinking"" milk. In the early morning of 21 September 1995, rumours of the elephant-headed deity Ganesha sipping milk from a spoon spread across the country. Offering food and drink like milk to the gods is an integral part of Hindu rituals. In 2001, ""a monkey-man"" reportedly attacked hundreds of people in Delhi. Reports later suggested it was  case of mass hysteria. Thousands started travelling to a popular beach in Mumbai in 2006 after rumours that the sea water had miraculously turned sweet.

"Kenya's president, Uhuru Kenyatta (pictured, far left), met Donald Trump at a recent G7 summit in Italy A firm that worked for Donald Trump and which once claimed ties to a pro-Brexit campaign group is now reportedly working for Kenya's incumbent president. Cambridge Analytica's mission statement is simple. On its website, the firm says it ""uses data to change audience behaviour."" Most notably, the company was hired by Donald Trump's presidential campaign and has been given some credit for Trump's electoral success. The company purchases and compiles demographic data on voters. On its website, Cambridge Analyticaclaims,externalto possess up to 5,000 data points on more than 230 million Americans. When combined with on-the-ground surveys, Cambridge Analytica can use this vast information bank to target key messages to relevant voters. Now, Cambridge Analytica is working in Kenya, helping in the effort to re-elect President Uhuru Kenyatta. On 10 May, The Star newspaper in Kenyareported,externalthat Kenyatta's Jubilee Party had hired the firm, and a month later, the same newspaper reported that Cambridge Analytica was working from the seventh floor of the party's headquarters in Nairobi. Cambridge Analytica refused to comment on those reports to BBC Trending, but the global privacy-protection charity Privacy Internationalsuggests,externalthat the company is being paid $6 million for its work in the country. Eight things about the Kenyan elections Kenya election: Fake CNN and BBC news reports circulate Kenyan victim of 2007 post-election violence speaks to BBC BBC Trending onFacebook,external Cambridge Analytica's involvement in Kenyan politics began in 2013, when the company worked for Kenyatta and The National Alliance - the forerunner of the Jubilee Party. During that year's campaign, the company correlated online data with 47,000 on-the-ground surveys.According,externalto the Cambridge Analytica website, this allowed the company to create a profile of the Kenyan electorate and come up with a campaign strategy ""based on the electorate's needs (jobs) and fears (tribal violence)."" Kenyatta won the 2013 election. Kenyans are among the most active social media users in Africa. The number of mobile phone users in the country shot up from 8 million in 2007 to 30 million in 2013, and 88% of the population can now access the internet through their phones. Having served as Minister of Information and Communication from 2005 to 2013, Bitange Ndemo was one of the driving forces behind Kenya's technological expansion. He told BBC Trending that social media plays a ""key role"" in the country's political campaigns. ""It provides a fast way of responding to your opponent's propaganda,"" he said. ""Plus, it is perhaps the only medium that can reach most young people."" At the same time, Kenya's recent political history has been marred by violence. This reached a peak after the 2007 general election, when a contested result caused ethnic divisions to erupt - 1,100 people were killed in the ensuing conflict, while 650,000 were displaced. ""Kenya is very tricky political terrain,"" says Paul Goldsmith, an American researcher and writer who's lived in Kenya for 40 years. ""Cambridge Analytica might have access to surveys and other data, but that doesn't necessarily translate into useful insights. There's always something unpredictable during elections here. There's always a curveball."" ""Western companies, charities and development experts tend to run into obstacles when they come to Africa,"" Goldsmith says. ""I would be surprised if Cambridge Analytica was any different."" Ethnic divisions continue to frame Kenyan politics. Each political party remains closely affiliated with a particular ethnic group. Though Kenyatta did not stand for president in 2007, he was accused of encouraging members of his native Kikuyu ethnic group to attack members of the Luo ethnic group, who were represented in the election by Raila Odinga. The charge was taken to the International Criminal Court, but ultimatelydismissedin December 2014 due to a lack of evidence. Odinga, who maintains that he was cheated out of victory in 2007, is standing against Kenyatta this time around. Raila Odinga has run for president on three previous occasions During primary elections earlier this year, held to decide the candidates for each party, seven people were killed as rival groups accused each other of vote rigging. And, earlier this week, it wasreportedthat a senior election official had been tortured to death. A spokesperson for Cambridge Analytica told Trending that the company is not involved in any negative advertising in Kenya, and that the company ""has never advocated the exploitation of ethnic divisions in any country."" Cambridge Analytica's presence in Kenya has prompted concerns about data protection. ""Kenya does not currently have specific data protection legislation,"" says Claire Lauterbach, a researcher at Privacy International. ""This basically means that it's unclear which agencies or companies can have access to individuals' data, including sensitive information."" Cambridge Analytica's strategy involves the mass harvesting and analysis of voter data. Data protection campaigners are therefore concerned about what might happen to this data after the election. The issue even worries former government ministers, including Bitange Ndemo, who says the government has failed to pass the data protection laws that he drafted when in office. ""Somehow Parliament did not quite understand its importance,"" he told Trending. ""We need to protect personal data. The fears that data may be abused should be a concern to all."" In response, Cambridge Analytica said that the company is not compiling individualised data profiles on Kenyan voters, and a spokesperson also stated that a data harvesting programme on the same scale as recent American campaigns is not possible in Kenya. Cambridge Analytica claims that it helped Trump to win crucial swing states Cambridge Analytica is heavily funded by Robert Mercer, a US businessman who helped to fund Donald Trump's presidential campaign and was a member of Trump's transition team. Mercer is also a major donor to Breitbart News, the website that current White House chief strategist Steve Bannon ran before joining the Trump campaign, and Bannon was once on Cambridge Analytica's board of directors. The UK's privacy watchdog, the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO), iscurrently investigatingthe use of data analytics in the EU referendum campaign and has stated that it has concerns about Cambridge Analytica's use of personal data. BBC Newsnight: Did Cambridge Analytica play a role in the EU referendum? Breitbart: The web that connects Trump and Farage Following the Brexit vote, it was widely reported that Cambridge Analytica had assisted the unofficial Leave.EU campaign - affiliated with former UKIP leader Nigel Farage and insurance tycoon Aaron Banks.

"Last month, drivers working for Deliveroo and UberEats were among five people injured by moped riders in north London. The food delivery company Deliveroo is introducing safety measures to try to protect its riders from violence. It follows acid attacks in London last month, where the victims included riders delivering by bike or moped. Since then, over 70 Deliveroo riders have said they did not want to complete a delivery because of safety fears. Among the measures being introduced are a new app feature that allows riders to raise security concerns, plus a trial of helmet cameras. Last month, two riders working for Deliveroo and UberEats were among five people injured within 90 minutes in north London by moped riders who threw acid in their faces. Deliveroo drivers are all self-employed so are not entitled to sick pay if they get attacked. They also use their own bikes and mopeds to deliver. The company says it has upgraded its app for its riders, allowing them to raise safety concerns about specific delivery addresses. These will then be shared with the company's headquarters and local authorities. It is also conducting a trial with helmet-mounted cameras to allow riders to gather evidence, and to pass on information to the police. The trial is taking place in Hackney, east London, which has become a trouble spot for riders. Deliveroo is also hiring 50 new staff who will have a focus on rider safety. Delivery rider Jabed Hussein was the first victim in the series of acid attacks last month. He was working for delivery company UberEats. He told the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme: ""It was like getting fire on my face, I was screaming on the street. ""This shouldn't be a job where your life should be put at risk. ""Drivers I know are now clocking off at 22:00, it's too dangerous after then. ""Most of them won't work after this, whereas we used to work until 01:00. ""Now, I feel I'm working in some sort of jungle, like anything can eat me, I'm not safe."" Deliveroo managing director Dan Warne said: ""The safety of our riders is the most important thing to us, and it's our responsibility as a company to step up our efforts so they can feel safe all of the time.""
