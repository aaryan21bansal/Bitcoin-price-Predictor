"This video can not be played West Brom 1-3 West Ham: I'm not long term - Allardyce on West Brom departure Sam Allardyce will leave his role as West Brom manager at the end of the season. Allardyce suffered his first Premier League relegation when defeat at Arsenal on 9 May ensured they would drop into the Championship. The former Bolton, Newcastle, West Ham, Sunderland and England boss succeeded the sacked Slaven Bilic at West Brom on an 18-month contract in December. Allardyce, 66, said he felt unable to commit to Albion for the long term. He said: ""West Bromwich Albion made me a generous offer to stay at The Hawthorns that shows the commitment of an ambitious club. After serious consideration, I have decided not to accept that offer. ""If I were to stay and achieve promotion next season the expectation would be for me to continue for at least another season and, sadly, that is not a commitment I feel able to make at this stage of my career."" Liverpool tighten up top 4 race & bye Big Sam West Brom technical director Luke Dowling said the club had ""very much hoped to have Sam in charge for next season and beyond"". The club, promoted as Championship runners-up last term, suffered their 21st defeat of the campaign with a 3-1 loss at home to West Ham on Wednesday. They are 19th in the table, having taken 26 points from 37 games. Allardyce's final match in charge will be away to Leeds United on Sunday. His assistant Sammy Lee and first-team coach Robbie Stockdale will also leave the club. ""Sam, Sammy and Robbie came in at a really difficult time for the football club and worked tirelessly in their efforts to keep the club in the Premier League,"" Dowling said. ""Unfortunately, collectively, we were unable to achieve our goal of surviving relegation. In the second half of the season, we played with passion and desire, delivering some memorable results with organised, entertaining football. ""Ultimately, we were unable to accumulate the points total required to keep us here, but Sam certainly restored pride with a number of resilient displays."" Allardyce was sacked by Everton in May 2018 after six months in charge, having taken the club from 13th in the Premier League to eighth - but he was criticised for the side's style of play. Before joining the Toffees, Allardyce had resigned as Crystal Palace manager after five months in charge, in what was his first job since a one-game spell as England manager. He said leaving West Brom was the result of ""a long, hard decision with a lot of thought about what is best for me and the club"". ""We chose our words very carefully,"" he added. ""I am flattered they wanted me to stay on. ""I was given the assurances over the budget but it is about me being a short-term manager. When you are put in that pigeon hole, that is how I see myself now, as a troubleshooter or a Red Adair. I didn't expect to be in this situation. ""We fought and fought but were not quite good enough at the end. I was more confident we would get out of trouble. Chelsea away [a 5-2 win] was brilliant. I was sad we couldn't keep those results up."" On whether he will continue in management, Allardyce said: ""We don't last forever. ""I went 20 years without a break. It was only when I got sacked at Newcastle when I got a break. The tingle will never leave you. It is an addiction. ""I am not going to say I am retiring because I have done that before and it makes you look a fool."" The news came as a surprise to the West Brom squad, as defender Kyle Bartley explained Allardyce only told the players when they returned to the dressing room at full-time. ""It's a bit of a shock. I think most of us expected he would be here next season,"" Bartley told Sky Sports. ""He just said that he had come to a decision that he won't be here next year. He thinks the club would be in better hands going in a different direction. ""I thought he would have been fantastic for us next year. I'd have thought we would have a really good chance of going back up. But I fully respect his decision."" Speaking on BBC Match of the Day, former Liverpool midfielder Danny Murphy, said: ""He was talking about being pigeon-holed. I think he was having a little dig. But four wins in 24 is not good enough. ""You cannot hide behind the numbers. He does talk about the lack of activity early in the January window when he could have got some players in more quickly. They need a big change of direction now in terms of the way they play."" BBC Sport's Simon Stone Twenty-four hours after one former England manager confirmed he was stepping away from the club scene, Sam Allardyce has followed Roy Hodgson's lead. At 66, Allardyce is seven years younger than Hodgson. And while it doesn't sound as though he is ready to abandon football management just yet, he was without a job for 18 months after he left Everton in 2019 before West Brom called in the middle of this season, so there can be no guarantees of another opportunity. Indeed, given the clubs he has already managed, there are not a huge amount of obvious alternatives remaining for Allardyce to take. A blunt, entertaining speaker, Allardyce has already proved adept as a pundit and will not be short of work if he heads in that direction. And then, by his own admission, he will wait for the call from a club in crisis. Red Adair, Allardyce memorably said his mates have started calling him, after the renowned American oil well firefighter. He will hope there is one last fire to put out - and that when the chance comes, this time he is equal to the task. 1991-1992: Limerick.First stint in management as player manager of the Irish club. 1992: Preston North End.Youth-team coach and a brief stint as caretaker manager. 1994-1996: Blackpool.First managerial role in England but sacked after failing to achieve promotion. 1997-1999: Notts County.Led them to the Third Division (now League Two) title in 1997-98. 1999-2007: Bolton Wanderers.Won promotion to the Premier League in 2001 and led them to a League Cup final and Uefa Cup qualification. 2007-2008: Newcastle.Left after just eight months in charge following a disappointing run of results. 2008-2010: Blackburn.Guided club to Premier League safety in his first season before he was sacked in December 2010 with Rovers 13th. 2011-2015:West Ham.Led Hammers to promotion to Premier League in 2012 but left three years later following criticism of his playing style. 2015-2016:Sunderland.Appointed in October and guided the Black Cats to Premier League safety. 2016: England.Appointed Three Lions boss but left by mutual consent after one match and 67 days in charge following a newspaper investigation claiming he offered advice on how to ""get around"" rules on player transfers. 2016-17: Crystal Palace.Appointed in December 2016 and led the Eagles to Premier League safety. 2017-18: Everton.Finished eighth with the Toffees after joining in November 2017 but left in May the following year. 2020-21: West Brom.Took over from Slaven Bilic with the club 19th in the table but was unable to avoid relegation Powerful new drama Danny Boy:Searching for truth in the fog of war The Cost of Concussion:Watch as former rugby players take legal action over their brain injuries BBC Sport Premier League West Bromwich Albion official site Comments can not be loaded To load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browser Football & transfers latest: Amorim news conference and Moyes to Everton updates Moyes in talks with Everton over return to club Alexander-Arnold not to blame for goals conceded - Slot Dragonsâ Den returns with a new line-up of celebrity guests Can a fresh batch of entrepreneurs secure the deal of a lifetime?

"This video can not be played Jan Spivey and Louise Smith, two of the women affected, were delighted by the court's decision Thousands of women who were victims of the PIP breast implant scandal should receive compensation, a French appeal court has decided. Women involved in the case say they are elated and exhausted after 10 years of fighting for justice. The court also upheld an earlier judgement finding German safety body TUV Rheinland negligent. TUV said it had acted ""diligently"", and that women must prove they had a PIP implant to be entitled to compensation. It awarded safety certificates for faulty breast implants made by French company Poly Implant ProthÃ¨se (PIP). The court decision could have far-reaching implications for thousands of other victims around the world. PIP breast implant scandal: Victims visited by bailiffs PIP breast implants: 'serious lessons must be learned' Jan Spivey, one of 540 British women involved in the case, was given PIP implants after she had a mastectomy due to breast cancer. After hearing the decision, she said she was ""elated and exhausted"". ""It's been a very long journey,"" she said. ""We've been in and out of court, and that's been really difficult for women. We've got health issues and we've got lots of other responsibilities too - PIP has had an impact on the whole of our lives. ""It's been an inescapable issue."" Jan developed aching joints, pain and fatigue after having the implants, and once they were removed it was clear they had been leaking silicone into her body. Jan Spivey suffered years of health problems after having PIP breast implants ""My PIP implants from 20 years ago are still impacting on my life and my health and my wellbeing, even today,"" Jan said. ""I think I've been angry every single day for the 20 years I've been affected by PIP."" Olivier AumaÃ®tre, the lawyer representing Jan Spivey and around 2,700 others in the current case, said it was an historic day for the victims and for women's rights. He said the company would now have to fully compensate all the women judged to be victims. ""I'm very happy for all the women I represent who have waited for such a long time for this decision and suffered for such long periods,"" he said. But many hundreds of women in the UK are still waiting for legal decisions on their cases and their right to compensation. Oliver Thorn, lawyer with Slee Blackwell Solicitors, represents 500 women. He said many still had their breast implants in place because they did not have the money to get them replaced, and that was why they needed compensation. ""The cosmetic surgery industry as a whole needs to sit up and see what has gone on here and it's time things were changed,"" he said. The president of The British Association of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons Mary O'Brien said the UK medicines' regulator, the MHRA, had an important role in ensuring a similar scandal over implants never happened again. ""The human cost and distress to many women and their families following surgery involving PIP implants is sobering,"" she said. Plastic surgeons supported the setting up of a breast implant registry to improve patient safety. They advise patients to consult their surgeon if concerned about symptoms related to their implants and read all reliable sources of information before undergoing breast implant surgery for any reason. Another woman affected by the case, Nicola Mason - who had breast implants which then ruptured - said the court decision was ""a victory, it's amazing"". ""We've waited a long time for this,"" she told the Today programme on BBC Radio 4. Nicola first found out about the rupture when she was pregnant, after noticing a large lump under her arm. She said it was ""quite traumatic and there was absolutely nothing I could do"". Eventually, the implants were removed but she says she has been left with a massive lump of silicone under her arm which still flares up. ""I don't think anyone knows the long-term effects,"" she says. This video can not be played How safe are breast implants? Between 2001 and 2010 the substandard implants were manufactured by the French company Poly Implant ProthÃ¨se or PIP. It was liquidated in 2010 and its founder was later given a prison sentence after it emerged the implants were filled with cheap, industrial-grade silicone which was not cleared for human use. It is estimated up to 400,000 women worldwide have received the illegal implants. Latin America was worst hit, in particular Colombia, where there are estimated to be 60,000 victims. In the UK it is thought 47,000 women are affected. The case, known as TUV1, was the first to be brought, a decade ago, against TUV Rheinland which issued European safety certificates for the PIP implants. Lawyers for the German company said they disagreed with the French court's decision for holding the company liable, ""even partly"". ""The evidence in this case clearly shows that TÃV Rheinland acted diligently, in compliance with applicable regulations,"" they said. At no time, the company said, had it been aware that breast implants manufactured by PIP were not compliant. The ruling is expected to have wider implications for almost 20,000 other women, half of whom are British, who are taking similar legal action in France. Alifie Jones had her implants removed last month Alifie Jones is recovering at home after having her faulty PIP breast implants removed last month. She was finally convinced by a friend to take them out after suffering years of extreme exhaustion and debilitating pain. She says the worst thing about it was wondering why she felt so ill all the time: ""Not knowing what it was, the mysterious illnesses, not being able to exercise. Not being vibrant, having my life, sort of stolen from me in a way."" The surgeon was shocked by what he found when he removed one of the implants. It had broken into multiple pieces inside her - exposing her body to an industrial-grade silicone gel. ""I can't believe they were allowed to be implanted in me. I don't know how they got through regulations. ""But I feel guilty that I messed about with my body and I put them in in the first place. But I'm angry that a human being can do that to another human being."" Did you receive a PIP implant? Share your experiences by emailinghaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external.

"The price of Bitcoin fell below $34,000 (Â£24,030) for the first time in three months on Wednesday, after China imposed fresh curbs on crypto-currencies. Beijing banned banks and payment firms from providing services related to crypto-currency transactions. It also warned investors against speculative crypto trading on Tuesday. It follows falls in Bitcoin of more than 10% last week after Tesla said it would no longer accept the currency. On Wednesday afternoon, Bitcoin recovered some ground, although it was still down -10.4% at $38,131. Meanwhile, other digital currencies such as Ether, which acts as the fuel for the Ethereum blockchain network, and Dogecoin lost as much as 22% and 24% respectively. Another big US bank to start trading in Bitcoin Tesla will no longer accept Bitcoin, says Elon Musk Elon Musk scammers make millions in crypto-fraud At the same time, Tesla shares fell more than 3% on Wall Street, possibly because of the electric carmaker's exposure to Bitcoin. The firm, owned by Elon Musk, still holds around $1.5bn worth of the crypto-currency. Crypto-currency trading has been illegal in China since 2019 in order to curb money-laundering. But people are still able to trade in currencies such as Bitcoin online, which has concerned Beijing. Elon Musk said crypto-currency could ""not come at great cost to the environment"" On Tuesday, three state-backed organisations, including the National Internet Finance Association of China, the China Banking Association and the Payment and Clearing Association of China issued a warning on social media. They said consumers would have no protection if they were to incur any losses from crypto-currency investment transactions. They added that recent wild swings in crypto-currency prices ""seriously violate people's asset safety"" and are disrupting the ""normal economic and financial order"". Neil Wilson of Markets.com said: ""China has for some time been putting pressure on the crypto space, but this marks an intensification - other countries might follow now as central banks make strides towards their own digital currencies. ""Until now, Western regulators have been pretty relaxed about Bitcoin, but this might change soon."" In March, Tesla boss Elon Musk announced unexpectedly that the electric carmaker would allow customers to buy cars using Bitcoin. But last week, he did a U-turn and suspended vehicle purchases using Bitcoin because of environmental concerns. His fears centre on Bitcoin mining - the energy-intensive process through which the digital currency is generated, using high-powered computers. It often relies on electricity generated with fossil fuels, particularly coal. ""We are concerned about rapidly increasing use of fossil fuels for Bitcoin mining and transactions, especially coal, which has the worst emissions of any fuel,"" Mr Musk wrote. ""Cryptocurrency is a good idea... but this cannot come at great cost to the environment."" He said the electric carmaker did not intend to sell any of its Bitcoin and intended to reinstate crypto-currency transactions once mining shifted to using more sustainable energy sources. Although the digital currency cannot be traded in China, more than 75% of Bitcoin mining around the world is done in China. For anyone who has followed the crypto-currency scene for a while, the events of recent weeks are a familiar story. Some random event - say, a tweet from Elon Musk announcing Tesla will accept crypto-currency payments - sends Bitcoin to new highs, and people begin to say it's winning mainstream acceptance. Then another random event happens, perhaps a change of course from the Tesla tycoon. It comes tumbling down again, and talk of it going mainstream fades into the background. Last month, in a chatroom on Clubhouse (another phenomenon that seems to be swinging from boom to bust) I expressed some scepticism about crypto-currencies. Up popped a senior figure from London's thriving fintech scene: ""Rory, Rory,"" he chided me, ""crypto is becoming an accepted asset class."" With big City institutions taking an interest, that had a ring of truth - back in April, at least. But this week, the weather had changed, with theFinancial Times,externalreporting ""new doubts among institutional fund managers over the future of crypto-currencies as an asset class"". My mind went back to 2013, when I had first taken an interest in Bitcoin. In a report for Radio 4's PM programme, I had bought a pizza for 0.5 BTC, a tortuous process which had not seemed worth the Â£30 it cost back then - of course, at today's exchange rate, that was a Â£14,000 pizza. I had also writtena blog post headlined ""The Bitcoin Bubble"", in which I tried to mine some lessons from a period when the price of the cryptocurrency shot up from $15 to $276 and then hurtled lower again. I ended a piece  in which I compared the cryptocurrency with 17th-Century Dutch tulips or London houses in the 1980s with this thought: ""Unless and until Bitcoin can be used to buy a sandwich, or be accepted by your friends when you pay them back for a restaurant meal, then it is likely to remain just a playground for geeks and gamblers."" Eight years on, it is still virtually impossible to buy a sandwich with Bitcoin. And why would you want to, when there's a good chance you'll be mocked a few years later - as I've been for my transaction - for giving away an asset that goes on to soar in value?

"This video can not be played Nicola Sturgeon unveils her new cabinet team Nicola Sturgeon has unveiled her new cabinet team, with several new faces being appointed to ministerial roles. Shirley-Anne Somerville has been named as the country's new education secretary, with Humza Yousaf moving from justice to health. Mr Yousaf has been replaced as justice secretary by Keith Brown. Finance Secretary Kate Forbes will take on an expanded role which will also give her responsibility for the economy brief. And Angus Robertson has been appointed as the constitution, external affairs and culture secretary - which is likely to be a key role as the Scottish government pushes for a second independence referendum. Mr Robertson was once the SNP's leader at Westminster and became an MSP in the election earlier this month. John Swinney to be minister for Covid recovery What is in Nicola Sturgeon's in-tray? Look back on how Sturgeon's reshuffle unfolded Other changes saw Michael Matheson take on a new role as cabinet secretary for net zero, energy and transport. Shona Robison is the new social justice, housing and local government secretary, and has been tasked with reducing child poverty as well as working to deliver on the SNP's pledge to build 100,000 affordable homes. Mairi Gougeon replaces Fergus Ewing as the rural affairs and islands secretary after Mr Ewing stood down earlier on Wednesday - as did Fiona Hyslop, who had been the economy, fair work and culture secretary. It was announced on Tuesday that Deputy First Minister John Swinney would be given a new role with responsibility for co-ordinating the country's recovery from the Covid pandemic. The move meant Mr Swinney would no longer be the country's education secretary - with that role now being filled by Ms Somerville. Several other senior posts were left empty when ministers retired from parliament ahead of the election. They included Health Secretary Jeane Freeman, Constitution Secretary Mike Russell, Environment Secretary Roseanna Cunningham and Communities Secretary Aileen Campbell. Paul Wheelhouse - who had been energy minister - lost his seat in the election. Humza Yousaf is the new health secretary after previously being responsible for the justice brief The Scottish Conservatives said Ms Sturgeon had only been able to muster ""the same tired faces that have already failed Scotland's schools, hospitals and justice system."" And Scottish Labour said the new ministerial team must focus on the recovery from the pandemic rather than ""the arguments of the past"". Nicola Sturgeon has made big changes to her cabinet - even if many of the ""new"" faces are rather familiar ones. To start with, she has slimmed down the full cabinet from 12 to 10, with roles such as environment and transport being combined. Kate Forbes is the only minister who keeps their old job, with a beefed-up finance portfolio. Michael Matheson keeps his transport job, but ""net zero"" and the climate emergency will be a big focus of his new role. Shirley-Anne Somerville and Humza Yousaf have arguably the biggest jobs in education and health, and this is part of a pattern of posts going to more experienced hands rather than fresh faces. This team actually has more in common with the cabinet appointed in 2016 than with the most recent version, from 2018 - with Keith Brown and Shona Robison reclaiming their places at the top table. And another of the ""new"" ministers is Angus Robertson, a former deputy leader of the SNP who has 16 years of experience as an MP. Mairi Gougeon is the only junior minister to win promotion into the full cabinet. Ms Sturgeon said her new team would ensure that Scotland had a ""serious government for the serious times we face as a nation"". She added: ""It is a government which will drive Scotland forward, as we look to build a just, fair and sustainable recovery from the Covid pandemic. ""My cabinet team combines experience with new arrivals and fresh faces, giving us the range and depth of talent we need to tackle the pressing issues we need to tackle, from covid to climate change."" Ms Sturgeon was sworn in as first minister at a ceremony in the Court of Session Ms Sturgeon later headed to the Court of Session to be formally sworn in as first minister. She won a vote of MSPs on Tuesday to ensure she remains in the role following the SNP's victory in the election on 6 May. Three new MSPs were among 15 junior ministerial appointments made later on Wednesday. Mairi McAllan, who was previously part of Ms Sturgeon's team of special advisers, became the new minister for environment, biodiversity and land reform. George Adam, who has been an MSP since 2011 and was the SNP group chief whip at Holyrood, was made the new minister for parliamentary business. Thomas Arthur, who had been deputy whip, was given the role of public finance, planning and community wealth minister. The remaining junior appointments were as follows: Richard Lochhead, who was minister for further and higher education, is minister for just transition, employment and fair work Maree Todd, who was children's minister, becomes minister for public health, women's health and sport Kevin Stewart is moved from housing to minister for mental wellbeing and social care Clare Haughey, previously mental health minister, is minister for children and young people Jamie Hepburn is moved from business minister to higher education and further education, youth employment and training Graeme Dey, who had been veterans minister and parliamentary business minister, is transport minister Ben MacPherson, who was rural affairs and environment minister, is social security and local government Angela Constance remains as minister for drugs policy Ivan McKee remains as minister for business, trade, tourism and enterprise Ash Denham remains community safety minister Christina McKelvie remains minister for equalities and older people Jenny Gilruth remains minister for culture, Europe and international development.

"This video can not be played Matt Hancock: ""This will be the first clinical study in the world to look at the impact of a booster jab"" The public is being urged to take part in trials to find out whether a third dose of Covid vaccine could protect against new variants. All seven vaccines the UK has ordered will be tested on working-age people and over-75s as part of a randomised trial. Data on side-effects and immune responses will be gathered. The findings will help vaccine advisers decide if re-vaccinating some people in the autumn is necessary. More than 20 million people have been fully vaccinated - with two doses of a Covid vaccine - since the UK's vaccination programme started, but it's still not clear how long protection lasts. Offering some groups a third dose to boost protection from coronavirus ahead of winter has been suggested - but not confirmed. The Cov-Boost study,external, which starts in June, will recruit 3,000 people of all ages who had their first dose in December or January, to test if this is worthwhile. ""It could be that some age groups may not need a booster and others do,"" said Prof Saul Faust, chief investigator for the trial, from the University of Southampton. ""We are not trying to say one is better than the other. ""The aim is to find out whether there should be a booster campaign and which vaccine to use,"" he said. Prof Faust said he was not expecting any vaccines to be ""detrimental"" but some could cause high fevers or very sore arms, for example, which would be useful to know. The vaccines will be trialled at 18 sites across the UK, and half doses will also be tested. The full list of sites is: Southampton, London (University College Hospital, Guy's and St Thomas' Hospital and Northwick Park Harrow), Leicester, Bournemouth, Portsmouth, Wrexham, Bradford, Oxford, Glasgow, Leeds, Cambridge, Birmingham, Brighton, Stockport, Liverpool and Exeter. Participants will be asked to keep diaries of any side-effects after a third dose, which could be one of seven different Covid vaccines, and researchers will test participants' immune response after one, three and 12 months. This involves testing their blood for antibodies to coronavirus - high levels are a sign that the body's defences are primed to fight off the virus. All doses would be from current vaccines, designed to protect against the original form of the virus. Where is the Indian variant and how is it spreading? Why is the UK taking a risk with the Indian variant? In addition to doses of AstraZeneca, Pfizer and Moderna, some people will be given doses of vaccines from Novavax, Janssen, Valneva and CureVac, which are currently being trialled in large numbers of people, but have not yet been approved by the UK regulator. There will also be a control group, who will be given a dummy vaccine. Even though the study is using current vaccines, rather than vaccines which have been updated to target new variants, scientists say they expect a boost in antibodies which could be enough to protect against all circulating forms of the virus. Dr Matthew Snape, associate professor of paediatrics and vaccinology at the University of Oxford, said the study was a world-first and there would be global interest in the results. Another study, called ComCov, which is testing using different doses of vaccines for the first and second doses found thatmixing doses increased mild-to-moderate symptoms after vaccination. The Cov-Boost study, which costs Â£19.3 million, is being funded by the government and led by the University Hospital Southampton NHS Foundation Trust, as part of the National Immunisation Schedule Evaluation Consortium (NISEC).

"Damage from an Israeli air strike overnight in Gaza City US President Joe Biden has told Israel's PM Benjamin Netanyahu he expects a ""significant de-escalation"" in the Gaza conflict on Wednesday. Mr Biden wanted a ""path to ceasefire"", the White House said. The US is a staunch ally of Israel and has so far opposed a joint UN Security Council statement on the conflict. In response Mr Netanyahu said he was ""determined to carry on"" until ""calm and security are restored to Israeli citizens"", according to Israeli media. The conflict is in its 10th day, with a continuing exchange of rocket fire from Palestinian militants into Israel and Israeli air strikes on Gaza. On Wednesday, four rockets were also fired from Lebanon into Israel and Israel's military responded by firing artillery shells at ""a number of targets in Lebanese territory"". It was not immediately clear whether this would prove to be a significant escalation. The Israel-Palestinian conflict explained The children who have died in the conflict The Gaza fighting began after weeks of rising Israeli-Palestinian tension in occupied East Jerusalem that culminated in clashes at a holy site revered by both Muslims and Jews. Hamas, which controls Gaza, began firing rockets after warning Israel to withdraw from the site, triggering retaliatory air strikes. At least 227 people, including more than 100 women and children, have been killed in Gaza so far, according to its health ministry. Israel has said at least 150 militants are among those killed in Gaza. Hamas does not give casualty figures for fighters. In Israel 12 people, including two children, have been killed, its medical service says. Israel says some 4,000 rockets have been fired towards its territory by militants in Gaza. On Wednesday morning, Mr Biden held his fourth call with Mr Netanyahu since the conflict started. A statement released by the White House,externalsaid: ""The president conveyed to the prime minister that he expected a significant de-escalation today on the path to a ceasefire."" This video can not be played Ex-UN rapporteur John Dugard: US is not honest broker in Israel-Gaza conflict The US has called before for a truce but has held up any joint UN statement, saying it would not help with de-escalation. The Palestinian representative at the UN, Riyad Mansour, called the Security Council's failure to express a unified position ""shameful"". The latest bid for a council resolution calling for a ceasefire, launched by France, failed on Wednesday when the US said it could ""undermine efforts to de-escalate"". A major foreign policy headache for Biden What the law says about the fighting One Israeli military source told Reuters that Israel was assessing whether conditions were right for a truce. The Ynet news website said that the Israelis were talking with Egyptian mediators. It quoted sources in the Israeli cabinet as saying Israel could achieve its objectives and end the fighting ""within days"". A Hamas leader said that efforts by mediators were ""serious and continuous"" but that Palestinian demands had to be met. Earlier on Wednesday Mr Netanyahu did not appear ready to begin a truce. He said there were ""only two ways that you can deal with"" Hamas. ""You can either conquer them, and that's always an open possibility, or you can deter them, and we are engaged right now in forceful deterrence, but I have to say we don't rule out anything."" The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said there had been renewed rocket fire from Gaza on Wednesday and that its fighter jets had attacked military infrastructure, including tunnels, and the homes of Hamas commanders. The BBC's Rushdi Abualouf in Gaza said two Palestinian militants were killed in Gaza City, as dozens of strikes targeted both it and the southern city of Khan Younis. Israel's Iron Dome anti-missile system intercepted Palestinian rockets throughout the night Gaza City mother of seven Randa Abu Sultan, 45, told AFP news agency: ""My four-year-old son tells me he's scared that if he falls asleep, he'll wake up to find us dead."" IDF spokesman Brig Gen Hidai Zilberman said Israel had tried to assassinate Mohammed Deif, the head of Hamas's military wing, the Izzedine al-Qassam Brigades. Mohammed Deif has survived repeated attempts on his life,including in the last major conflict in 2014. He tends to stay in the background and his whereabouts remain unknown. Sirens sounded across much of south and central Israel on Wednesday. Hamas also targeted an Israeli air base overnight but the IDF said no bases were hit. Israel defends Gaza strategy as death toll mounts Why is Gaza blurry on Google Maps? Of the 3,750 rockets fired from the Gaza Strip since the fighting began, 550 have fallen short in Gaza, according to the IDF. Israel's Iron Dome missile defence system has intercepted about 90% of the rockets that have crossed into Israeli territory, it says. The IDF estimated that at the start of the conflict, Hamas and Islamic Jihad, the two main groups in Gaza, had an arsenal of about 12,000 rockets or mortars. Mr Netanyahu said the Israeli operation had ""set Hamas back by many years"". There has also been unrest within Israel and in the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem, where Palestinians took part in a general strike on Tuesday. There were clashes in several locations. The party of Turkish President Erdogan rejected US accusations of anti-Semitism Separately on Wednesday, Turkey rejected US accusations that President Recep Tayyip Erdogan had made anti-Semitic remarks about Israel. He had accused Israel of ""terrorism"" against the Palestinians and recently said: ""It is in their nature"". State department spokesman Ned Price said the US found the remarks ""reprehensible"". Omer Celik, a spokesman for Mr Erdogan's party, said the president had given very strong messages against anti-Semitism, adding: ""Accusing our president of anti-Semitism is an illogical and untrue approach. This is a lie."" The worst violence in years between Israel and the Palestinian territory of the Gaza Strip has seen dozens killed. It follows a month of spiralling tensions before open conflict broke out. Here is what happened in the lead-up to the fighting. 13 April Clashes erupt in East Jerusalem between Palestinians and Israeli police. Palestinians are angry over barriers which had been placed outside the Damascus Gate entrance to the Jerusalem‘s Old City preventing them from gathering there after prayers at the Old City’s al-Aqsa Mosque on what is the first night of the Islamic holy month of Ramadan. Palestinian discontent had been stoked earlier in the day when President Mahmoud Abbas called off planned elections, implicitly blaming Israel over voting arrangements for Palestinians in East Jerusalem. Hamas - Mr Abbas' Islamist rivals who control Gaza and were running in the elections - react angrily to the postponement. Violence around Damascus Gate and elsewhere in East Jerusalem continues nightly. 15-16 April Rockets are fired from Gaza at Israel, which responds with air strikes after a relative period of calm between Israel and the Palestinian enclave. 19 April Clashes spread to the mixed Arab-Jewish port city of Jaffa, next to Tel Aviv. 20 April In Jerusalem, Jewish youths, angry over a spate of filmed assaults by Palestinians on Orthodox Jews posted on the TikTok video-sharing app, attack Arabs and chant anti-Arab slogans. 23 April Hundreds of ultra-nationalist Jews shouting “Death to Arabs” march towards Damascus Gate in protest at the Arab assaults on Jews. Clashes erupt at the site between Palestinians and police trying to separate the two groups, injuring dozens of people. Violence between Arabs and Jews spreads to other parts of the city. 24 April Militants fire dozens of rockets at Israel from Gaza, drawing retaliatory air strikes. 2 May President Abbas' Fatah faction and Hamas condemn the looming threatened eviction of Palestinian families from their homes in the Sheikh Jarrah district of East Jerusalem by Jewish settlers ahead of a planned court hearing. Hamas calls on Arabs to form “human shields of resistance” there. In the days that follow, police and protesters repeatedly clash at the site as it becomes a focal point for Palestinian anger. 4 May Militants in Gaza begin sending incendiary balloons into Israel over successive days, causing dozens of fires. 7 May Two Palestinian gunmen are shot dead and a third is wounded after opening fire on Israeli security forces in the northern West Bank. Israeli authorities say the group planned to carry out a “major attack” in Israel. Later on after Friday prayers - the last of Ramadan - major clashes erupt at the al-Aqsa mosque compound, injuring more than 200 people. Israel's police force says it used “riot dispersal means”, firing rubber bullets and stun grenades after officers came under a hail of stones and bottles. 8 May A second night of violence erupts in East Jerusalem after tens of thousands of worshippers prayed at the al-Aqsa mosque for Laylat al-Qadr, the holiest night of Ramadan. Police and protesters clash at Damascus Gate, with police using water cannon, rubber bullets and tear gas against crowds of Palestinians, some throwing stones. More than 120 Palestinians and some 17 police are injured. 9 May Israel's Supreme Court postpones the hearing on the Sheikh Jarrah case following calls to delay it because of the growing unrest. Tensions remain high though and more clashes take place between Israeli police and Palestinians in Sheikh Jarrah and at Damascus Gate. 10 May Early morning clashes break out between police and Palestinians at the al-Aqsa mosque compound, where crowds throw stones and officers fire stun grenades. Palestinian anger has been inflamed by an annual Jerusalem Day march planned for later in the day by hundreds of Israeli nationalists to celebrate Israel's capture of East Jerusalem in 1967. The march is due to pass through predominantly Arab parts of the Old City in what is seen by Palestinians as a deliberate provocation. It is rerouted at the 11th hour, but the atmosphere remains volatile with more than 300 Palestinians and some 21 police injured in the violence at the holy site. Hamas issues an ultimatum to Israel to “withdraw its soldiers... from the blessed al-Aqsa mosque and Sheikh Jarrah” by 18:00. When the deadline passes without an Israeli response, rockets are fired towards Jerusalem for the first time in years. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says the group has “crossed a red line” and Israel retaliates with air strikes, killing three Hamas fighters. A continuing exchange of rocket-fire and air strikes quickly escalates into the fiercest hostilities between the two sides since they fought a war in 2014.

"This video can not be played Transport Secretary Grant Shapps claims rail restructure will simplify fares Rail passengers have been promised a better and more efficient service under the biggest shake-up in decades. A new state-owned body, Great British Railways (GBR), will set timetables and prices, sell tickets in England and manage rail infrastructure. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said it would replace an ""overcomplicated and fragmented"" system. He told the BBC the changes did not mean fares would inevitably rise, but could not give guarantees. Asked on Today if the changes meant rising ticket prices, Mr Shapps said: ""No, is the answer"". But he added: ""I'm not here to give guarantees for years to come."" Labour said there was ""little substance"" behind the plans. The government says a more unified rail system will lead to more ""high-quality, consistent services"" from 2023 onwards, plus better connections. There will also be changes to make travel smoother, including: Simplifying the purchase of tickets, which critics have long-complained is confusing There will be a ""significant rollout"" of more pay as you go, contactless and digital ticketing on smartphones A single, more straightforward compensation system And from next month flexible season tickets will be available for some people who commute two or three times a week. The flexible season tickets will offer savings on certain routes for people who do not travel to work every day, reflecting the expected changes to commuting patterns after the pandemic. They are due to go on sale on 21 June for use seven days later, and will allow passengers to travel on any eight days in a 28-day period. What does the rail shake-up mean for you? Darshita Rajani, who lives in Wellingborough but works in London, welcomes the idea of a flexible season ticket. Currently a season ticket for her journey costs just under Â£8,000. But she will only be doing three days a week when she goes back to the office so that would be prohibitively expensive. ""If things don't change I will still have to buy a season ticket, which is a waste of money, but a day ticket costs Â£116,"" she tells the BBC. ""It's insane how much they charge for a 50-minute train journey. I hope there will be two-days-a-week, three-days-a-week flexi tickets."" The reforms follow the chaotic introduction of new timetables in May 2018 and years of complaints about the ""fragmented"" franchising system, which has been scrapped. GBR will replace the current track operator, Network Rail, in 2023 and the government says the new system will look more like Transport for London, with multiple operators under one brand. The systems will differ slightly in Scotland and Wales, where transport is devolved, but GBR will still operate in those nations. Is it safe to use public transport again? 'Keep spending on transport for return to work' Rail franchises axed as help for train firms grows The Department for Transport said in Scotland and Wales will continue to exercise their current powers and be accountable for them, but the government will explore options to ensure all nations benefit from the reforms. GBR will continue to own the infrastructure in Scotland and Wales (other than some of the South Wales Valley Lines), as Network Rail does now. Rail in Northern Ireland is devolved and not linked to the wider UK network. Mr Shapps said the ultimate aim was to create ""one guiding mind"" overseeing the UK rail system, so there was there is more accountability when things went wrong. Most rail services will still be run by the private sector, but under new ""passenger contracts"" they will be expected to meet targets on punctuality and efficiency for the first time. The reforms follow the chaotic introduction of a new rail timetable in 2018 which caused severe disruption Keith Williams, the former boss of British Airways who led the review into the reforms, told the BBC's Today programme: ""What we've done here is listen to what customers want out of rail and react to that. ""And that really is a more reliable punctual service and better opportunities [when] buying tickets. ""There is an enormous opportunity here not only to simplify the way that people buy tickets, but also to benefit from a retail environment which gives greater flexibility in the way that fares are operated in the future."" Mr Shapps, who also worked on the review, said the the new reforms would give the railways ""solid and stable foundations for the future"" after ""years of fragmentation, confusion and over-complication."" On possible fare rises, he pointed out that the taxpayer had plugged a Â£12bn hole during the coronavirus crisis to keep the railways operating and fares were subsidised. But he said there was no ""hidden agenda"". ""Of course any government in the future will have to weigh those things up,"" he said. If the plan is followed through and properly implemented, it should see an end to the squabbling over who is to blame when the trains are late, dirty or overcrowded. Everything will be the problem of a single body. That concentration of power will also be a potential Achilles' heel. One of the successes of the privatisation was the freedom for train companies to do new things - a freedom that was a partial factor in the remarkable revival in passenger numbers in the past two decades. If that spirit of innovation is lost - and if civil servants and politicians endlessly interfere in the working of the new authority - the railways risk sliding into stagnation. The fear among railway executives is that the Treasury, having had to pay dearly to support services during the pandemic, will seek to claw back spending, leading to cuts in services. This video can not be played RMT leader Mick Lynch criticises government's restructuring of the railways as a ""missed opportunity"" Anthony Smith, chief executive of passenger watchdog Transport Focus, said passengers would welcome a move ""towards a more accountable and joined-up railway"". ""Ultimately what they will care about is whether rail is the best option for them, if it is reliable, efficient and good value,"" he said. But Labour's shadow transport secretary, Jim McMahon, said the the reforms were unlikely to work. ""With fare hikes, Â£1bn cuts to Network Rail and broken promises to communities across the country, it's yet another example of ministers talking a good game, with very little substance underneath."" Henri Murison, director of the Northern Powerhouse Partnership, welcomed the plan in principle saying the old franchise model ""was broken"". But he called for more to be done on lowering fares in the North. ""Although more pay-as-you-go ticketing is welcome, the lack of greater progress in fares reform means that there is less incentive for people to stop using their cars to travel around the North."" BRAND NEW DRAMA:Five friends are bound together by a fragile pact of silence... MEDICINE AND LIFE EXPECTANCY:How the smallpox vaccine changed our world Meanwhile, the Rail Delivery Group, which represents train operators, said the proposals could deliver ""the biggest changes in a generation"". Director general Andy Bagnall said: ""Train operators called for a guiding mind and Great British Railways will help to bring the whole industry together. ""To deliver for passengers and freight customers, it must have the independence to hold the operators of both tracks and trains to account equally. Crucially, it needs to allow operators to put their customers at the absolute forefront of decision-making,"" he added. The publication of the plan comes eight months afterthe government scrapped the system of rail franchising, which had been in force since privatisation, and unveiled plans to extend support for train firms. After a drop in passenger numbers during the pandemic as more people worked from home, taxpayer money was used to plug the shortfall in ticket revenues.

"The government must urgently act on its pledge to extend bereavement payments to co-habiting couples, a cross-party group of MPs has said. The group wants ministers to comply within three months of court rulings that say limiting the benefits to married couples breached human rights. A Labour MP behind the move said current rules ""punished"" the children of unmarried parents. Boris Johnson vowed last year to ""remedy"" the ""injustice"". Campaigners saidaround 2,000 co-habiting families a yearlose out on the payments, made to individuals whose husband, wife or civil partner has died. Ministerspledged in July last year,externalto extend the payments to cover co-habiting couples with children, but are yet to bring forward proposals. The Department of Work and Pensions said it was ""carefully considering"" how to implement the change. Bereavement payments for co-habiting couples urged Unmarried partners still missing bereavement pay Mother must get widow payments, court rules Bereavement Support Payment,externalis a benefit paid to families for 18 months if a husband, wife or civil partner dies - but unmarried partners are ineligible. It is awarded at different levels according to individual circumstances, but can rise to almost Â£10,000 if a couple receives child benefit. In February 2020, the High Court found denying co-habiting parents the payments was against their human rights. It followed a similar judgment at the Supreme Court in 2018. MPs and child poverty campaigners have been lobbying ministers since then to update the legislation to reflect the ruling. Such a law was not included in last week's Queen's Speech - when the government set out its legislative programme for the coming year. On Wednesday, a group of 54 MPs signed a symbolic amendment to the programme, calling on ministers to ""fully remedy"" the situation by complying with the rulings within three months. It was later defeated by 366 votes to 265. One of the MPs to sign the amendment, Labour's Stella Creasy, said it would support ""some of the most vulnerable people in our communities"". She added that figures from the Child Bereavement Network showed ""every 22 minutes in this country, a child loses a mother or a father"" and risked losing their home or their family circumstances as a result. Ms Creasy said: ""It's estimated 2,000 families a year who find themselves in that horrific situation - many more who will have done because of Covid - are then not eligible for financial support. ""The reason they are not eligible is something very simple. Because the state has decided that because their parents are not married those children must be pushed in to poverty."" She added: ""The government knows it has to remedy this situation, because otherwise we are punishing children for the decisions that their parents have made."" A spokesman for the Department of Work and Pensions said it was committed to extending the payments to co-habiting couples, adding: ""We understand how vital this support is to families.

"This video can not be played MOTD analysis: âCommandingâ Phillips key to âgutsyâ Liverpoolâs win Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp likened his side's victory at Burnley to winning ""a semi-final"" that takes them to Sunday's ""final"" against Crystal Palace and the chance to seal a top-four finish. Liverpool's incredible win at West Bromwich Albion on Sunday kept their Champions League hopes alive and at Turf Moor they built on their last-gasp weekend heroics with a victory that was much tighter than the scoreline suggests. A cool finish from Roberto Firmino turned the game Liverpool's way then a first club goal for Nathaniel Phillips and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain's late drive made the points safe and improved the Reds' goal difference. The Reds are now in the fourth Champions League spot, level on points with fifth-placed Leicester City and with a goal difference four better than the Foxes. Klopp's side host the Eagles in Roy Hodgson's last game in charge in four days' time, with 10,000 fans inside Anfield. The Foxes are at home to Tottenham while Chelsea, who are a point better off than both, are at Aston Villa. ""Today was a semi-final,"" Klopp told Sky Sports. ""We had to win the semi-final and we did. ""Nothing is decided yet but we improved our position and we have the final. That's what we needed. It's what we deserve because this was a top performance. ""Now we have to make sure we recover quickly. We have a thin squad in some positions. We have to wrap them in cotton wool. ""I can't wait for the 10,00 fans at Anfield. Nothing is decided - Palace are strong."" Action from Burnley v Liverpool, plus the rest of Wednesday's Premier League games Liverpool tighten up top 4 race & bye Big Sam This video can not be played Burnley 0-3 Liverpool: Klopp says Reds played 'really good football' Having required a sensational injury-time goal from goalkeeper Alisson to complete a comeback and beat West Brom at the weekend, the Reds endured another stressful encounter at Turf Moor. They were harried all over the pitch throughout by a committed home side keen to impress their 3,000 fans and provide them with an end to a terrible run of home form. Liverpool struggled to deal with the Clarets' energetic pressing, especially in the first-half, with the home side's physicality posing a challenge the Reds failed at times to deal with. However, despite their relative inexperience at the back, Phillips and Rhys Williams did well on the whole against the in-form Chris Wood, with the former even adding a welcome goalscoring element to his play. Having come up for a corner, the 24-year-old was perfectly placed to head home when Mane swung over a cross from the left - his first goal in what has been an unexpected but vital 20 appearances for the injury-hit Reds this season. Phillips also positioned himself perfectly on the line to clear a Ben Mee header that would have given the visitors a far more challenging final 20 minutes. As it was, they snatched a third, with Oxlade-Chamberlain scoring his first goal - a fine finish after evading Charlie Taylor - at the end of a season hampered by injury as well as long spells on the bench. It was Firmino's goal, though, that had much earlier provided the crucial breakthrough, his low finish from Andy Robertson's pull-back being the first shot the visitors had managed on target in a frantic and often end-to-end first half. It was not a comfortable experience for Klopp's side but not much has been during their run of nine games unbeaten that has put them on the verge of salvaging something from this hugely disappointing season. ""It never is easy,"" Klopp told BBC Sport. ""I can't remember an easy game against Burnley. ""What a job Sean Dyche is doing here. The way they play is so tricky to defend against. They are smart. ""Apart from a nervy start passing-wise, we had to adapt to the atmosphere in the stadium, but then we played really good football."" The Reds are now into the top four for the first time since February off the back of a fourth straight victory - their longest winning run of the campaign. One more will be enough unless Leicester run riot against Tottenham and significantly improve their goal difference. This video can not be played Burnley 0-3 Liverpool: Sean Dyche says Burnley weren't 'effective in final third' Burnley have now extended an unwanted club record to 10 consecutive top-flight home league games without a win, dating back to January. With fans back inside Turf Moor, the home side were clearly in a mood to make amends, harrying all over the pitch, snapping into tackles and diving in to block shots. James Tarkowski and Mee were typically combative in an attempt to protect goalkeeper Will Norris, starting his first Premier League game for the club. Things could have been different had Wood not fired an effort wide after nipping in behind the Liverpool defence to get on to a long ball forward, but this was indicative of the lack of ruthlessness that has, at times, blighted their season. ""We've had a really tough season,"" Dyche told BBC Sport. ""We've had some knocks on the way. ""I thought we gave a good account of ourselves. We have actually played pretty well over the last few weeks but we haven't taken our chances. ""We could have been effective in the final third when it really counts. That's probably been my biggest bug."" There is little more Dyche could have asked from his players both in this game and the league campaign, which has again seem them defy their relatively small budget to stay in the division. However Dyche will be eager to end on a high at Sheffield United before a summer that the long-serving manager will hope sees more investment than in the previous close season. ""There's always a lot to do here,"" said Dyche. ""It's a restart every summer. We will see what happens and what can be done investment wise. ""We have a base here to work on and it's how we layer up on top of that to find the next generation of players to keep moving forward."" Liverpool haven't lost any of the 14 Premier League matches in which Roberto Firmino has scored the opening goal of the game (W12 D2) - including winning each of the last 11 in a row. Liverpool forward Roberto Firmino is only the second player to score in three consecutive Premier League away games at Turf Moor, after Anthony Martial. Indeed, the Brazilian has now scored as many times in his last three league appearances as in the 19 matches beforehand (3). Including a spell at Stuttgart last season, Nathaniel Phillips' header was his first career goal as a professional, on what was his 20th appearance for Liverpool across all competitions. Since the start of last season, Burnley have lost all five of their Premier League games without Nick Pope in goal, conceding 3.4 goals per game on average, compared to just 1.2 in the 70 top-flight games in which he has started for the Clarets. Since the start of the 2017-18 season, only Kevin de Bruyne (49) has more Premier League assists than Liverpool full-back Andrew Robertson (35), who assisted twice in a Premier League game for the first time since April 2019.

"Israeli PM Netanyahu says he is ""determined to carry on"" with the military operation in Gaza until ""calm and security are restored"" Earlier US President Biden told Netanyahu he expected a ""significant de-escalation"" on Wednesday Israel shells targets in Lebanon after four rockets were fired towards Israel from Lebanese territory Efforts to broker a truce between Israel and Palestinian militants continue, but little progress appears to have been made âThe operation is continuing at full throttle. There is still no ceasefire on the table,â Israeli defence sources tell the BBC Hamas officials, meanwhile, say ceasefire efforts ""are serious and continuingâ but Palestinian demands must be met New Israeli air strikes hit Gaza overnight as fighting entered a 10th day At least two militants were killed in strikes on apartment buildings in the territory Barrages of rockets were also fired into Israel, with Hamas saying it targeted an air base in the south Edited by Alix Kroeger This image shows rockets launched from Gaza towards Israel in a photo captured by an Israeli naval boat while patrolling in the Mediterranean Sea We're now pausing our live coverage of the ongoing Israel-Gaza conflict - many thanks for staying with us. To recap, here are the key developments from the past 24 hours:  Contributing to today's live page were David Gritten, Joshua Cheetham, Yaroslav Lukov, Gareth Evans, Thomas Spender, Alix Kroeger, Joshua Nevett and Mal Siret The conflict has inflicted a heavy human toll At least 227 people have been killed in Gaza since fighting between Israel and Palestinian militants in the enclave began, according to health officials. Gaza's health ministry said 64 children, 38  women, and 17 elderly people were among the dead, while 1,620 people were wounded. Israel's military says it has killed more than 100 Palestinian militants in Gaza. Hamas, the Palestinian militant group that runs the territory, does not give casualty figures for fighters. In Israel at least 12 people, including two children, have been killed, its medical authorities say. The violence in Gaza and Israel is the worst since 2014. Despite the best efforts of world leaders, there is currently no sign of a ceasefire. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (C) is among the Democratic lawmakers who backed the resolution Democratic lawmakers in the US have launched a last-minute push to block the sale of weapons to Israel as they call for a ceasefire in Gaza. Several progressive lawmakers in the Democratic-controlled House of Representatives have backed a resolution to stop the $735m (Â£520m) sale. But the resolution is expected to fail, because Democratic leaders in the legislative chamber have expressed support for the sale. The resolution is seen as a symbolic move to put pressure on US President Joe Biden, who told Israel's prime minister to move towards de-escalation earlier today. As the conflict has intensified, Biden has been confronted with growing disquiet among Democratic and Republican lawmakers over his position towards Israel. On the Democratic side, members of Congress have become more critical of Israel as they express concern for human rights in Gaza. Meanwhile, Republicans have accused Biden of not offering enough support to Israel in the face of rocket attacks by Palestinian militants. Israel's military conducts a strike near the border between Israel and the Gaza strip Israel's army says it has targeted the head of Hamas's military wing, Mohammed Deif, during the ongoing strikes on Gaza. A spokesman for the Israel Defense Forces (IDF), Brig Gen Hidai Zilberman, said Israel had tried to assassinate Deif, the head of the Izzedine al-Qassam Brigades. Deif, who has been on the Israeli army's most-wanted list for over two decades, has survived repeated attempts on his life over the years,including in the last major conflict in 2014. Israeli news website Ynet reported that in one of the operations, Deif had been in his bunker when Israel hit the location. He tends to stay in the background and his whereabouts remain unknown. Hamas has not confirmed the reports. A United Nations relief agency has been delivering aid to Gaza Israel has accused a United Nations relief agency of ""cynical misrepresentation"" for suggesting it was preventing humanitarian aid from entering the Gaza Strip. On Tuesday the aid agency for Palestinians, known as UNRWA,called on Israel to enable access to Gaza for humanitarian supplies and its staff.,external The agency said Israel had not approved such access and was therefore failing to meet its obligations under international law. But Israel's foreign ministry denied this in a statement on Wednesday. It said rocket fire from Palestinian militants in Gaza, not Israel, had halted the transfer of humanitarian aid on Tuesday and Wednesday. âUNRWAâs claim that Israel is preventing humanitarian aid from reaching Gaza is a cynical misrepresentation and simply a lie,â the statement said. ""Israel will continue its efforts to co-ordinate the transfer of humanitarian aid into Gaza, taking into account security considerations.â As the fighting enters its 10th day, and air strikes and rocket fire continue, let's take a look at what triggered the latest violence. It was sparked by days of escalating clashes between Palestinians and Israeli police at a holy hilltop compound in East Jerusalem earlier this month. The site is revered by both Muslims, who call it the Haram al-Sharif (Noble Sanctuary), and Jews, for whom it is known as the Temple Mount. Hamas demanded Israel remove police from there and the nearby predominantly Arab district of Sheikh Jarrah, where Palestinian families face eviction by Jewish settlers. Hamas launched rockets when its ultimatum went unheeded. Palestinian anger was further fuelled by Israel's annual celebration of its capture of East Jerusalem in the 1967 Middle East war, known as Jerusalem Day. The fate of the city, with its deep religious and national significance to both sides, lies at the heart of the decades-old Israel-Palestinian conflict. Prime Minister Boris Johnson vowed to root out anti-Semitism in the UK Now let's turn to the UK, where Prime Minister Boris Johnson has condemned a spike in anti-Semitic incidents in the country since the Israel-Gaza conflict began. Johnson was asked what he would do to support Jewish communities in the UK during questioning by opposition leader Sir Keir Starmer in parliament. ""I share his horror at the outbreak of anti-Semitic incidents and the government has conveyed that message loud and clear to those who are responsible for enforcing the law against hate crime,"" Johnson said. He said anti-Semitism must be called out ""at every stage"", adding: ""We will not let it take root, we will not allow it to grow and fester."" His comments came after 116 anti-Semitic incidents were reported over 11 days from 8 May in the UK - a five-fold increase on the previous period. Those incidents were recorded by the Community Security Trust (CST), which offers safety advice to the Jewish community in the UK. Recent incidents dealt with by the police includean attack on Rabbi Rafi Goodwin near his synagogue in north London. Hossein Salami says Palestinians have emerged as a ""missile-equipped nation"" The head of Iran's Islamic Revolution Guard Corps (IRGC) has said that Iran backs the Palestinians against what it calls the ""Zionist regime"" (Israel). In a televised address, Hossein Salami said the conflict showed that ""Palestinians have emerged as a missile-equipped nation."" Iran is a major supporter of Hamas, which it backs financially and militarily. The two sides fell out after Hamas refused to support Iran's ally, Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, in Syria's civil war. But the two sides have since reconciled. An escalation of fighting between Israelis and Palestinians has led the United Nations to warn of a ""full-scale war"". The latest violence followed weeks of rising tensions in Jerusalem, though the conflict has gone on for decades. Here's our explainer, looking at the key issues. The Israeli military has continued to carry out air strikes in Gaza in response to rocket fire from Palestinian militants Following news of Joe Biden's call for a ""de-escalation"", a Hamas spokesman in Gaza, Hazem Qassem, has told reporters that Israel has been refusing to engage with diplomatic efforts to end the violence. ""There are no specific dates for the issue of the ceasefire, because all the international efforts that are being made, as well as the Egyptian efforts, are met with an Israeli position that refuses to deal with ceasefire initiatives,"" he said. He told Reuters news agency that if Israel ended its ""bombardment on Gaza... there can be room to talk about
arrangements to restore calm"". Netanyahu has reaffirmed his commitment to Israeli strikes on Palestinian militants in Gaza Israeli's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has vowed to continue his government's operation against Palestinian militantsin a video statement posted to Twitter a short time ago,external. His comments came shortly after a phone call with US President Joe Biden, who told him to move towards de-escalation. While Netanyahu did not comment on the call, he said he appreciated Bidenâs support of Israelâs right to defend itself. However, he added: ""I am determined to continue this operation until its goal is achieved - to bring back peace and security to you, the citizens of Israel."" Diplomatic calls for a ceasefire have so far proved fruitless. BBC OS Two Israeli Arabs have told the BBC about their experiences of living in Israel since the fighting began Each day this week, we've been speaking to the different communities affected by the Israel-Gaza conflict. On Wednesday, we heard from friends Khadija and Adrieh, two Israeli Arab women.. Israeli Arabs are people who live in Israel but strongly identify with Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank. Both young mums, Khadija and Adrieh grew up together in Jaffa, a city with mixed communities of people with Palestinian and Jewish backgrounds. Since the fighting began, there have been flare-ups of intercommunal violence between Israeli Arabs and Jews across Israel. Khadija told the BBC she was afraid to go out and live her life as usual. ""Itâs not new to be afraid to be an Arab woman here in Israel, but itâs very new to me to be afraid to walk in my neighbourhood,"" she said. ""If you canât feel safe in your country, you canât feel like you belong to this country."" You can hear more from Khadija and Adrieh bylistening to BBC OS programme on World Service radio. The US has again said it will not back a French-proposed UN Security Council draft resolution calling for a ceasefire, stressing that it could undermine efforts to de-escalate the crisis, the AFP news agency reports. ""We've been clear and consistent that we are focused on intensive diplomatic efforts under way to bring an end to the violence and that we will not support actions that we believe undermine efforts to de-escalate,"" a US spokesperson at the UN told the news agency. The US is one of the five permanent UN Security Council members with a veto power. Earlier on Wednesday, US President Joe Biden told Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu in a phone conversation that he expected ""a significant de-escalation today on the path to a ceasefire"". This video can not be played MSF: Violence is curbing healthcare access in Gaza Dr Natalie Thurtle from medical NGO Doctors Without Borders (MSF) has been telling the BBC how her organisation has been struggling to provide medical care on the ground amid the continuing violence. âThe border to Gaza is closed and no humanitarian corridor has been negotiated,â she said, calling for an end to the fighting. Palestinians in Gaza, meanwhile, are ""frightened, their children are frightened, they are hiding in the basement every night"", she says. Barbara Plett UsherBBC News, Wilmington This is the first time that US President Joe Biden has directly and publicly pressed Israel for a ceasefire - or spoken with such urgency. Until now, he had been stressing Israelâs right to defend itself and insisting that Hamas stop its rocket fire. Today he told Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that this has to be the beginning of the end, to significantly wind down the Israeli operation on the way to a ceasefire. He linked his comments to what he said was progress in degrading Hamas' capabilities, and to the state of affairs in Gaza, which is facing a deepening humanitarian crisis. There's been increasing political and international pressure on Mr Biden to intervene more forcefully to push for an end to the violence. With another UN Security Council meeting set for tomorrow, he seems to be indicating that the US is becoming less willing to give Israel diplomatic cover. An area in the city of Shfaram in northern Israel is cordoned off after rockets were fired from Lebanon If you're just joining our coverage of the renewed fighting between Israel and Palestinian militants, here are the latest developments: Nine-year-old Yara (left) and five-year-old Rula (right) were killed alongside several family members on Sunday Of the 219 people killed in Gaza at least 63 are children, according to its health ministry, while of the 10 people killed in Israel, two children are among the dead, the country's medical service says. Among the children killed in Gaza were sisters Yara, 9, and Rula, 5 from the al-Kawalek family. Both had been receiving treatment for trauma from the Norwegian Refugee Council (NRC). The al-Kawaleks were polite girls who always did their homework on time, one of their teachers, who did not want be named, told the BBC. Ido Avigal, five, who was killed in a Hamas rocket attack The youngest victim on the Israeli side is thought to be Ido Avigal, a five-year-old boy killed last Wednesday in the southern town of Sderot. Ido was killed inside a fortified room in what the Israeli military described as an ""incredibly rare"" incident. Rocket shrapnel pierced the protective metal plating used to cover the window of the room he was in, also injuring his mother and seven-year-old sister. He died of his injuries hours later. Ibrahim al-Masry was playing with his siblings in the front yard of their home in a northern neighbourhood of Gaza last week, when a strike hit, according to reports. ""We were laughing and having fun, when suddenly they began to bomb us, everything around us caught fire,"" his brothertold the AFP news agency,external. You can read more about the children who have died in the fightinghere. This video can not be played John Dugard: US not an honest broker in Israel-Gaza conflict John Dugard, a former United Nations Special Rapporteur to the UNHCR, has told the BBC that he believes the US is ""not an honest broker"" in the Israel-Gaza conflict. ""First of all there's the evidence provided by the failure of United States to support a [UN Security Council] resolution at this stage,"" Mr Dugard said. ""Secondly there's the fact that the US continues to operate its embassy from Jerusalem, which is contrary to international law."" The US has called for a ceasefire, but it has been blocking attempts by the UN Security Council to issue a joint statement, saying this would not help with the de-escalation of hostilities. We reported yesterday that two men from Thailand working at a packaging factory in southern Israel had been killed by Palestinian rocket-fire. The two men, who were employed at the Obad farming estate in Eshkol town, have been named as Sikharin Sangamram, 24, and Weerawat Karanborirak, 44. Israel's Kan News tweeted images of the two men.

At least eight other Thai workers were wounded in yesterday's rocket attack, Thailand's foreign ministry said. It's not unusual for citizens of Thailand to seek work in Israel, and the two countries have a good relationship. A senior Thai diplomat in Israel told the BBC that around 4,000 of the country's citizens had been working in southern Israel when the latest conflict erupted, but that some were relocated to safer areas over the weekend. Paul AdamsBBC diplomatic correspondent, Jerusalem As we reported earlier, US President Joe Biden spoke to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on the phone, telling him he expected a ""significant de-escalation today"". The tone of that call suggests the US is losing patience with Israelâs military attacks. With another UN Security Council meeting looming on Thursday, the White House is indicating that it may be less willing to offer diplomatic cover to Israel, one of its closest allies. Speaking to foreign ambassadors this morning, Netanyahu said it was not possible to set a timeframe on the operation in Gaza. Last night, local reports in Israel suggested a ceasefire could be announced as early as Thursday morning. But these reports have not been confirmed. Â© 2025 BBC.

The tone of that call suggests the US is losing patience with Israelâs military attacks. With another UN Security Council meeting looming on Thursday, the White House is indicating that it may be less willing to offer diplomatic cover to Israel, one of its closest allies. Speaking to foreign ambassadors this morning, Netanyahu said it was not possible to set a timeframe on the operation in Gaza. Last night, local reports in Israel suggested a ceasefire could be announced as early as Thursday morning. But these reports have not been confirmed. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Israeli PM Netanyahu says he is ""determined to carry on"" with the military operation in Gaza until ""calm and security are restored"" Earlier US President Biden told Netanyahu he expected a ""significant de-escalation"" on Wednesday Israel shells targets in Lebanon after four rockets were fired towards Israel from Lebanese territory Efforts to broker a truce between Israel and Palestinian militants continue, but little progress appears to have been made âThe operation is continuing at full throttle. There is still no ceasefire on the table,â Israeli defence sources tell the BBC Hamas officials, meanwhile, say ceasefire efforts ""are serious and continuingâ but Palestinian demands must be met New Israeli air strikes hit Gaza overnight as fighting entered a 10th day At least two militants were killed in strikes on apartment buildings in the territory Barrages of rockets were also fired into Israel, with Hamas saying it targeted an air base in the south Edited by Alix Kroeger This image shows rockets launched from Gaza towards Israel in a photo captured by an Israeli naval boat while patrolling in the Mediterranean Sea We're now pausing our live coverage of the ongoing Israel-Gaza conflict - many thanks for staying with us. To recap, here are the key developments from the past 24 hours:  Contributing to today's live page were David Gritten, Joshua Cheetham, Yaroslav Lukov, Gareth Evans, Thomas Spender, Alix Kroeger, Joshua Nevett and Mal Siret The conflict has inflicted a heavy human toll At least 227 people have been killed in Gaza since fighting between Israel and Palestinian militants in the enclave began, according to health officials. Gaza's health ministry said 64 children, 38  women, and 17 elderly people were among the dead, while 1,620 people were wounded. Israel's military says it has killed more than 100 Palestinian militants in Gaza. Hamas, the Palestinian militant group that runs the territory, does not give casualty figures for fighters. In Israel at least 12 people, including two children, have been killed, its medical authorities say. The violence in Gaza and Israel is the worst since 2014. Despite the best efforts of world leaders, there is currently no sign of a ceasefire. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (C) is among the Democratic lawmakers who backed the resolution Democratic lawmakers in the US have launched a last-minute push to block the sale of weapons to Israel as they call for a ceasefire in Gaza. Several progressive lawmakers in the Democratic-controlled House of Representatives have backed a resolution to stop the $735m (Â£520m) sale. But the resolution is expected to fail, because Democratic leaders in the legislative chamber have expressed support for the sale. The resolution is seen as a symbolic move to put pressure on US President Joe Biden, who told Israel's prime minister to move towards de-escalation earlier today. As the conflict has intensified, Biden has been confronted with growing disquiet among Democratic and Republican lawmakers over his position towards Israel. On the Democratic side, members of Congress have become more critical of Israel as they express concern for human rights in Gaza. Meanwhile, Republicans have accused Biden of not offering enough support to Israel in the face of rocket attacks by Palestinian militants. Israel's military conducts a strike near the border between Israel and the Gaza strip Israel's army says it has targeted the head of Hamas's military wing, Mohammed Deif, during the ongoing strikes on Gaza. A spokesman for the Israel Defense Forces (IDF), Brig Gen Hidai Zilberman, said Israel had tried to assassinate Deif, the head of the Izzedine al-Qassam Brigades. Deif, who has been on the Israeli army's most-wanted list for over two decades, has survived repeated attempts on his life over the years,including in the last major conflict in 2014. Israeli news website Ynet reported that in one of the operations, Deif had been in his bunker when Israel hit the location. He tends to stay in the background and his whereabouts remain unknown. Hamas has not confirmed the reports. A United Nations relief agency has been delivering aid to Gaza Israel has accused a United Nations relief agency of ""cynical misrepresentation"" for suggesting it was preventing humanitarian aid from entering the Gaza Strip. On Tuesday the aid agency for Palestinians, known as UNRWA,called on Israel to enable access to Gaza for humanitarian supplies and its staff.,external The agency said Israel had not approved such access and was therefore failing to meet its obligations under international law. But Israel's foreign ministry denied this in a statement on Wednesday. It said rocket fire from Palestinian militants in Gaza, not Israel, had halted the transfer of humanitarian aid on Tuesday and Wednesday. âUNRWAâs claim that Israel is preventing humanitarian aid from reaching Gaza is a cynical misrepresentation and simply a lie,â the statement said. ""Israel will continue its efforts to co-ordinate the transfer of humanitarian aid into Gaza, taking into account security considerations.â As the fighting enters its 10th day, and air strikes and rocket fire continue, let's take a look at what triggered the latest violence. It was sparked by days of escalating clashes between Palestinians and Israeli police at a holy hilltop compound in East Jerusalem earlier this month. The site is revered by both Muslims, who call it the Haram al-Sharif (Noble Sanctuary), and Jews, for whom it is known as the Temple Mount. Hamas demanded Israel remove police from there and the nearby predominantly Arab district of Sheikh Jarrah, where Palestinian families face eviction by Jewish settlers. Hamas launched rockets when its ultimatum went unheeded. Palestinian anger was further fuelled by Israel's annual celebration of its capture of East Jerusalem in the 1967 Middle East war, known as Jerusalem Day. The fate of the city, with its deep religious and national significance to both sides, lies at the heart of the decades-old Israel-Palestinian conflict. Prime Minister Boris Johnson vowed to root out anti-Semitism in the UK Now let's turn to the UK, where Prime Minister Boris Johnson has condemned a spike in anti-Semitic incidents in the country since the Israel-Gaza conflict began. Johnson was asked what he would do to support Jewish communities in the UK during questioning by opposition leader Sir Keir Starmer in parliament. ""I share his horror at the outbreak of anti-Semitic incidents and the government has conveyed that message loud and clear to those who are responsible for enforcing the law against hate crime,"" Johnson said. He said anti-Semitism must be called out ""at every stage"", adding: ""We will not let it take root, we will not allow it to grow and fester."" His comments came after 116 anti-Semitic incidents were reported over 11 days from 8 May in the UK - a five-fold increase on the previous period. Those incidents were recorded by the Community Security Trust (CST), which offers safety advice to the Jewish community in the UK. Recent incidents dealt with by the police includean attack on Rabbi Rafi Goodwin near his synagogue in north London. Hossein Salami says Palestinians have emerged as a ""missile-equipped nation"" The head of Iran's Islamic Revolution Guard Corps (IRGC) has said that Iran backs the Palestinians against what it calls the ""Zionist regime"" (Israel). In a televised address, Hossein Salami said the conflict showed that ""Palestinians have emerged as a missile-equipped nation."" Iran is a major supporter of Hamas, which it backs financially and militarily. The two sides fell out after Hamas refused to support Iran's ally, Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, in Syria's civil war. But the two sides have since reconciled. An escalation of fighting between Israelis and Palestinians has led the United Nations to warn of a ""full-scale war"". The latest violence followed weeks of rising tensions in Jerusalem, though the conflict has gone on for decades. Here's our explainer, looking at the key issues. The Israeli military has continued to carry out air strikes in Gaza in response to rocket fire from Palestinian militants Following news of Joe Biden's call for a ""de-escalation"", a Hamas spokesman in Gaza, Hazem Qassem, has told reporters that Israel has been refusing to engage with diplomatic efforts to end the violence. ""There are no specific dates for the issue of the ceasefire, because all the international efforts that are being made, as well as the Egyptian efforts, are met with an Israeli position that refuses to deal with ceasefire initiatives,"" he said. He told Reuters news agency that if Israel ended its ""bombardment on Gaza... there can be room to talk about
arrangements to restore calm"". Netanyahu has reaffirmed his commitment to Israeli strikes on Palestinian militants in Gaza Israeli's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has vowed to continue his government's operation against Palestinian militantsin a video statement posted to Twitter a short time ago,external. His comments came shortly after a phone call with US President Joe Biden, who told him to move towards de-escalation. While Netanyahu did not comment on the call, he said he appreciated Bidenâs support of Israelâs right to defend itself. However, he added: ""I am determined to continue this operation until its goal is achieved - to bring back peace and security to you, the citizens of Israel."" Diplomatic calls for a ceasefire have so far proved fruitless. BBC OS Two Israeli Arabs have told the BBC about their experiences of living in Israel since the fighting began Each day this week, we've been speaking to the different communities affected by the Israel-Gaza conflict. On Wednesday, we heard from friends Khadija and Adrieh, two Israeli Arab women.. Israeli Arabs are people who live in Israel but strongly identify with Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank. Both young mums, Khadija and Adrieh grew up together in Jaffa, a city with mixed communities of people with Palestinian and Jewish backgrounds. Since the fighting began, there have been flare-ups of intercommunal violence between Israeli Arabs and Jews across Israel. Khadija told the BBC she was afraid to go out and live her life as usual. ""Itâs not new to be afraid to be an Arab woman here in Israel, but itâs very new to me to be afraid to walk in my neighbourhood,"" she said. ""If you canât feel safe in your country, you canât feel like you belong to this country."" You can hear more from Khadija and Adrieh bylistening to BBC OS programme on World Service radio. The US has again said it will not back a French-proposed UN Security Council draft resolution calling for a ceasefire, stressing that it could undermine efforts to de-escalate the crisis, the AFP news agency reports. ""We've been clear and consistent that we are focused on intensive diplomatic efforts under way to bring an end to the violence and that we will not support actions that we believe undermine efforts to de-escalate,"" a US spokesperson at the UN told the news agency. The US is one of the five permanent UN Security Council members with a veto power. Earlier on Wednesday, US President Joe Biden told Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu in a phone conversation that he expected ""a significant de-escalation today on the path to a ceasefire"". This video can not be played MSF: Violence is curbing healthcare access in Gaza Dr Natalie Thurtle from medical NGO Doctors Without Borders (MSF) has been telling the BBC how her organisation has been struggling to provide medical care on the ground amid the continuing violence. âThe border to Gaza is closed and no humanitarian corridor has been negotiated,â she said, calling for an end to the fighting. Palestinians in Gaza, meanwhile, are ""frightened, their children are frightened, they are hiding in the basement every night"", she says. Barbara Plett UsherBBC News, Wilmington This is the first time that US President Joe Biden has directly and publicly pressed Israel for a ceasefire - or spoken with such urgency. Until now, he had been stressing Israelâs right to defend itself and insisting that Hamas stop its rocket fire. Today he told Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that this has to be the beginning of the end, to significantly wind down the Israeli operation on the way to a ceasefire. He linked his comments to what he said was progress in degrading Hamas' capabilities, and to the state of affairs in Gaza, which is facing a deepening humanitarian crisis. There's been increasing political and international pressure on Mr Biden to intervene more forcefully to push for an end to the violence. With another UN Security Council meeting set for tomorrow, he seems to be indicating that the US is becoming less willing to give Israel diplomatic cover. An area in the city of Shfaram in northern Israel is cordoned off after rockets were fired from Lebanon If you're just joining our coverage of the renewed fighting between Israel and Palestinian militants, here are the latest developments: Nine-year-old Yara (left) and five-year-old Rula (right) were killed alongside several family members on Sunday Of the 219 people killed in Gaza at least 63 are children, according to its health ministry, while of the 10 people killed in Israel, two children are among the dead, the country's medical service says. Among the children killed in Gaza were sisters Yara, 9, and Rula, 5 from the al-Kawalek family. Both had been receiving treatment for trauma from the Norwegian Refugee Council (NRC). The al-Kawaleks were polite girls who always did their homework on time, one of their teachers, who did not want be named, told the BBC. Ido Avigal, five, who was killed in a Hamas rocket attack The youngest victim on the Israeli side is thought to be Ido Avigal, a five-year-old boy killed last Wednesday in the southern town of Sderot. Ido was killed inside a fortified room in what the Israeli military described as an ""incredibly rare"" incident. Rocket shrapnel pierced the protective metal plating used to cover the window of the room he was in, also injuring his mother and seven-year-old sister. He died of his injuries hours later. Ibrahim al-Masry was playing with his siblings in the front yard of their home in a northern neighbourhood of Gaza last week, when a strike hit, according to reports. ""We were laughing and having fun, when suddenly they began to bomb us, everything around us caught fire,"" his brothertold the AFP news agency,external. You can read more about the children who have died in the fightinghere. This video can not be played John Dugard: US not an honest broker in Israel-Gaza conflict John Dugard, a former United Nations Special Rapporteur to the UNHCR, has told the BBC that he believes the US is ""not an honest broker"" in the Israel-Gaza conflict. ""First of all there's the evidence provided by the failure of United States to support a [UN Security Council] resolution at this stage,"" Mr Dugard said. ""Secondly there's the fact that the US continues to operate its embassy from Jerusalem, which is contrary to international law."" The US has called for a ceasefire, but it has been blocking attempts by the UN Security Council to issue a joint statement, saying this would not help with the de-escalation of hostilities. We reported yesterday that two men from Thailand working at a packaging factory in southern Israel had been killed by Palestinian rocket-fire. The two men, who were employed at the Obad farming estate in Eshkol town, have been named as Sikharin Sangamram, 24, and Weerawat Karanborirak, 44. Israel's Kan News tweeted images of the two men.

"Damage from an Israeli air strike overnight in Gaza City US President Joe Biden has told Israel's PM Benjamin Netanyahu he expects a ""significant de-escalation"" in the Gaza conflict on Wednesday. Mr Biden wanted a ""path to ceasefire"", the White House said. The US is a staunch ally of Israel and has so far opposed a joint UN Security Council statement on the conflict. In response Mr Netanyahu said he was ""determined to carry on"" until ""calm and security are restored to Israeli citizens"", according to Israeli media. The conflict is in its 10th day, with a continuing exchange of rocket fire from Palestinian militants into Israel and Israeli air strikes on Gaza. On Wednesday, four rockets were also fired from Lebanon into Israel and Israel's military responded by firing artillery shells at ""a number of targets in Lebanese territory"". It was not immediately clear whether this would prove to be a significant escalation. The Israel-Palestinian conflict explained The children who have died in the conflict The Gaza fighting began after weeks of rising Israeli-Palestinian tension in occupied East Jerusalem that culminated in clashes at a holy site revered by both Muslims and Jews. Hamas, which controls Gaza, began firing rockets after warning Israel to withdraw from the site, triggering retaliatory air strikes. At least 227 people, including more than 100 women and children, have been killed in Gaza so far, according to its health ministry. Israel has said at least 150 militants are among those killed in Gaza. Hamas does not give casualty figures for fighters. In Israel 12 people, including two children, have been killed, its medical service says. Israel says some 4,000 rockets have been fired towards its territory by militants in Gaza.

The latest bid for a council resolution calling for a ceasefire, launched by France, failed on Wednesday when the US said it could ""undermine efforts to de-escalate"". A major foreign policy headache for Biden What the law says about the fighting One Israeli military source told Reuters that Israel was assessing whether conditions were right for a truce. The Ynet news website said that the Israelis were talking with Egyptian mediators. It quoted sources in the Israeli cabinet as saying Israel could achieve its objectives and end the fighting ""within days"". A Hamas leader said that efforts by mediators were ""serious and continuous"" but that Palestinian demands had to be met. Earlier on Wednesday Mr Netanyahu did not appear ready to begin a truce. He said there were ""only two ways that you can deal with"" Hamas. ""You can either conquer them, and that's always an open possibility, or you can deter them, and we are engaged right now in forceful deterrence, but I have to say we don't rule out anything."" The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said there had been renewed rocket fire from Gaza on Wednesday and that its fighter jets had attacked military infrastructure, including tunnels, and the homes of Hamas commanders. The BBC's Rushdi Abualouf in Gaza said two Palestinian militants were killed in Gaza City, as dozens of strikes targeted both it and the southern city of Khan Younis. Israel's Iron Dome anti-missile system intercepted Palestinian rockets throughout the night Gaza City mother of seven Randa Abu Sultan, 45, told AFP news agency: ""My four-year-old son tells me he's scared that if he falls asleep, he'll wake up to find us dead.""

Mohammed Deif has survived repeated attempts on his life,including in the last major conflict in 2014. He tends to stay in the background and his whereabouts remain unknown. Sirens sounded across much of south and central Israel on Wednesday. Hamas also targeted an Israeli air base overnight but the IDF said no bases were hit. Israel defends Gaza strategy as death toll mounts Why is Gaza blurry on Google Maps? Of the 3,750 rockets fired from the Gaza Strip since the fighting began, 550 have fallen short in Gaza, according to the IDF. Israel's Iron Dome missile defence system has intercepted about 90% of the rockets that have crossed into Israeli territory, it says. The IDF estimated that at the start of the conflict, Hamas and Islamic Jihad, the two main groups in Gaza, had an arsenal of about 12,000 rockets or mortars. Mr Netanyahu said the Israeli operation had ""set Hamas back by many years"". There has also been unrest within Israel and in the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem, where Palestinians took part in a general strike on Tuesday. There were clashes in several locations. The party of Turkish President Erdogan rejected US accusations of anti-Semitism Separately on Wednesday, Turkey rejected US accusations that President Recep Tayyip Erdogan had made anti-Semitic remarks about Israel. He had accused Israel of ""terrorism"" against the Palestinians and recently said: ""It is in their nature"". State department spokesman Ned Price said the US found the remarks ""reprehensible"". Omer Celik, a spokesman for Mr Erdogan's party, said the president had given very strong messages against anti-Semitism, adding: ""Accusing our president of anti-Semitism is an illogical and untrue approach. This is a lie."" The worst violence in years between Israel and the Palestinian territory of the Gaza Strip has seen dozens killed. It follows a month of spiralling tensions before open conflict broke out. Here is what happened in the lead-up to the fighting. 13 April Clashes erupt in East Jerusalem between Palestinians and Israeli police. Palestinians are angry over barriers which had been placed outside the Damascus Gate entrance to the Jerusalem‘s Old City preventing them from gathering there after prayers at the Old City’s al-Aqsa Mosque on what is the first night of the Islamic holy month of Ramadan. Palestinian discontent had been stoked earlier in the day when President Mahmoud Abbas called off planned elections, implicitly blaming Israel over voting arrangements for Palestinians in East Jerusalem. Hamas - Mr Abbas' Islamist rivals who control Gaza and were running in the elections - react angrily to the postponement. Violence around Damascus Gate and elsewhere in East Jerusalem continues nightly. 15-16 April Rockets are fired from Gaza at Israel, which responds with air strikes after a relative period of calm between Israel and the Palestinian enclave. 19 April Clashes spread to the mixed Arab-Jewish port city of Jaffa, next to Tel Aviv. 20 April In Jerusalem, Jewish youths, angry over a spate of filmed assaults by Palestinians on Orthodox Jews posted on the TikTok video-sharing app, attack Arabs and chant anti-Arab slogans. 23 April Hundreds of ultra-nationalist Jews shouting “Death to Arabs” march towards Damascus Gate in protest at the Arab assaults on Jews. Clashes erupt at the site between Palestinians and police trying to separate the two groups, injuring dozens of people. Violence between Arabs and Jews spreads to other parts of the city. 24 April Militants fire dozens of rockets at Israel from Gaza, drawing retaliatory air strikes. 2 May President Abbas' Fatah faction and Hamas condemn the looming threatened eviction of Palestinian families from their homes in the Sheikh Jarrah district of East Jerusalem by Jewish settlers ahead of a planned court hearing. Hamas calls on Arabs to form “human shields of resistance” there. In the days that follow, police and protesters repeatedly clash at the site as it becomes a focal point for Palestinian anger. 4 May Militants in Gaza begin sending incendiary balloons into Israel over successive days, causing dozens of fires. 7 May Two Palestinian gunmen are shot dead and a third is wounded after opening fire on Israeli security forces in the northern West Bank. Israeli authorities say the group planned to carry out a “major attack” in Israel. Later on after Friday prayers - the last of Ramadan - major clashes erupt at the al-Aqsa mosque compound, injuring more than 200 people. Israel's police force says it used “riot dispersal means”, firing rubber bullets and stun grenades after officers came under a hail of stones and bottles. 8 May A second night of violence erupts in East Jerusalem after tens of thousands of worshippers prayed at the al-Aqsa mosque for Laylat al-Qadr, the holiest night of Ramadan. Police and protesters clash at Damascus Gate, with police using water cannon, rubber bullets and tear gas against crowds of Palestinians, some throwing stones. More than 120 Palestinians and some 17 police are injured. 9 May Israel's Supreme Court postpones the hearing on the Sheikh Jarrah case following calls to delay it because of the growing unrest. Tensions remain high though and more clashes take place between Israeli police and Palestinians in Sheikh Jarrah and at Damascus Gate. 10 May Early morning clashes break out between police and Palestinians at the al-Aqsa mosque compound, where crowds throw stones and officers fire stun grenades. Palestinian anger has been inflamed by an annual Jerusalem Day march planned for later in the day by hundreds of Israeli nationalists to celebrate Israel's capture of East Jerusalem in 1967. The march is due to pass through predominantly Arab parts of the Old City in what is seen by Palestinians as a deliberate provocation. It is rerouted at the 11th hour, but the atmosphere remains volatile with more than 300 Palestinians and some 21 police injured in the violence at the holy site. Hamas issues an ultimatum to Israel to “withdraw its soldiers... from the blessed al-Aqsa mosque and Sheikh Jarrah” by 18:00. When the deadline passes without an Israeli response, rockets are fired towards Jerusalem for the first time in years. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says the group has “crossed a red line” and Israel retaliates with air strikes, killing three Hamas fighters. A continuing exchange of rocket-fire and air strikes quickly escalates into the fiercest hostilities between the two sides since they fought a war in 2014.

He had accused Israel of ""terrorism"" against the Palestinians and recently said: ""It is in their nature"". State department spokesman Ned Price said the US found the remarks ""reprehensible"". Omer Celik, a spokesman for Mr Erdogan's party, said the president had given very strong messages against anti-Semitism, adding: ""Accusing our president of anti-Semitism is an illogical and untrue approach. This is a lie."" The worst violence in years between Israel and the Palestinian territory of the Gaza Strip has seen dozens killed. It follows a month of spiralling tensions before open conflict broke out. Here is what happened in the lead-up to the fighting. 13 April Clashes erupt in East Jerusalem between Palestinians and Israeli police. Palestinians are angry over barriers which had been placed outside the Damascus Gate entrance to the Jerusalem‘s Old City preventing them from gathering there after prayers at the Old City’s al-Aqsa Mosque on what is the first night of the Islamic holy month of Ramadan. Palestinian discontent had been stoked earlier in the day when President Mahmoud Abbas called off planned elections, implicitly blaming Israel over voting arrangements for Palestinians in East Jerusalem. Hamas - Mr Abbas' Islamist rivals who control Gaza and were running in the elections - react angrily to the postponement. Violence around Damascus Gate and elsewhere in East Jerusalem continues nightly. 15-16 April Rockets are fired from Gaza at Israel, which responds with air strikes after a relative period of calm between Israel and the Palestinian enclave. 19 April Clashes spread to the mixed Arab-Jewish port city of Jaffa, next to Tel Aviv. 20 April In Jerusalem, Jewish youths, angry over a spate of filmed assaults by Palestinians on Orthodox Jews posted on the TikTok video-sharing app, attack Arabs and chant anti-Arab slogans. 23 April Hundreds of ultra-nationalist Jews shouting “Death to Arabs” march towards Damascus Gate in protest at the Arab assaults on Jews. Clashes erupt at the site between Palestinians and police trying to separate the two groups, injuring dozens of people. Violence between Arabs and Jews spreads to other parts of the city. 24 April Militants fire dozens of rockets at Israel from Gaza, drawing retaliatory air strikes. 2 May President Abbas' Fatah faction and Hamas condemn the looming threatened eviction of Palestinian families from their homes in the Sheikh Jarrah district of East Jerusalem by Jewish settlers ahead of a planned court hearing. Hamas calls on Arabs to form “human shields of resistance” there. In the days that follow, police and protesters repeatedly clash at the site as it becomes a focal point for Palestinian anger. 4 May Militants in Gaza begin sending incendiary balloons into Israel over successive days, causing dozens of fires. 7 May Two Palestinian gunmen are shot dead and a third is wounded after opening fire on Israeli security forces in the northern West Bank. Israeli authorities say the group planned to carry out a “major attack” in Israel. Later on after Friday prayers - the last of Ramadan - major clashes erupt at the al-Aqsa mosque compound, injuring more than 200 people. Israel's police force says it used “riot dispersal means”, firing rubber bullets and stun grenades after officers came under a hail of stones and bottles. 8 May A second night of violence erupts in East Jerusalem after tens of thousands of worshippers prayed at the al-Aqsa mosque for Laylat al-Qadr, the holiest night of Ramadan. Police and protesters clash at Damascus Gate, with police using water cannon, rubber bullets and tear gas against crowds of Palestinians, some throwing stones. More than 120 Palestinians and some 17 police are injured. 9 May Israel's Supreme Court postpones the hearing on the Sheikh Jarrah case following calls to delay it because of the growing unrest. Tensions remain high though and more clashes take place between Israeli police and Palestinians in Sheikh Jarrah and at Damascus Gate. 10 May Early morning clashes break out between police and Palestinians at the al-Aqsa mosque compound, where crowds throw stones and officers fire stun grenades. Palestinian anger has been inflamed by an annual Jerusalem Day march planned for later in the day by hundreds of Israeli nationalists to celebrate Israel's capture of East Jerusalem in 1967. The march is due to pass through predominantly Arab parts of the Old City in what is seen by Palestinians as a deliberate provocation. It is rerouted at the 11th hour, but the atmosphere remains volatile with more than 300 Palestinians and some 21 police injured in the violence at the holy site. Hamas issues an ultimatum to Israel to “withdraw its soldiers... from the blessed al-Aqsa mosque and Sheikh Jarrah” by 18:00. When the deadline passes without an Israeli response, rockets are fired towards Jerusalem for the first time in years. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says the group has “crossed a red line” and Israel retaliates with air strikes, killing three Hamas fighters. A continuing exchange of rocket-fire and air strikes quickly escalates into the fiercest hostilities between the two sides since they fought a war in 2014.

"Israeli PM Netanyahu says he is ""determined to carry on"" with the military operation in Gaza until ""calm and security are restored"" Earlier US President Biden told Netanyahu he expected a ""significant de-escalation"" on Wednesday Israel shells targets in Lebanon after four rockets were fired towards Israel from Lebanese territory Efforts to broker a truce between Israel and Palestinian militants continue, but little progress appears to have been made âThe operation is continuing at full throttle. There is still no ceasefire on the table,â Israeli defence sources tell the BBC Hamas officials, meanwhile, say ceasefire efforts ""are serious and continuingâ but Palestinian demands must be met New Israeli air strikes hit Gaza overnight as fighting entered a 10th day At least two militants were killed in strikes on apartment buildings in the territory Barrages of rockets were also fired into Israel, with Hamas saying it targeted an air base in the south Edited by Alix Kroeger This image shows rockets launched from Gaza towards Israel in a photo captured by an Israeli naval boat while patrolling in the Mediterranean Sea We're now pausing our live coverage of the ongoing Israel-Gaza conflict - many thanks for staying with us. To recap, here are the key developments from the past 24 hours:  Contributing to today's live page were David Gritten, Joshua Cheetham, Yaroslav Lukov, Gareth Evans, Thomas Spender, Alix Kroeger, Joshua Nevett and Mal Siret The conflict has inflicted a heavy human toll At least 227 people have been killed in Gaza since fighting between Israel and Palestinian militants in the enclave began, according to health officials. Gaza's health ministry said 64 children, 38  women, and 17 elderly people were among the dead, while 1,620 people were wounded. Israel's military says it has killed more than 100 Palestinian militants in Gaza. Hamas, the Palestinian militant group that runs the territory, does not give casualty figures for fighters. In Israel at least 12 people, including two children, have been killed, its medical authorities say. The violence in Gaza and Israel is the worst since 2014. Despite the best efforts of world leaders, there is currently no sign of a ceasefire. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (C) is among the Democratic lawmakers who backed the resolution Democratic lawmakers in the US have launched a last-minute push to block the sale of weapons to Israel as they call for a ceasefire in Gaza. Several progressive lawmakers in the Democratic-controlled House of Representatives have backed a resolution to stop the $735m (Â£520m) sale. But the resolution is expected to fail, because Democratic leaders in the legislative chamber have expressed support for the sale. The resolution is seen as a symbolic move to put pressure on US President Joe Biden, who told Israel's prime minister to move towards de-escalation earlier today. As the conflict has intensified, Biden has been confronted with growing disquiet among Democratic and Republican lawmakers over his position towards Israel. On the Democratic side, members of Congress have become more critical of Israel as they express concern for human rights in Gaza. Meanwhile, Republicans have accused Biden of not offering enough support to Israel in the face of rocket attacks by Palestinian militants. Israel's military conducts a strike near the border between Israel and the Gaza strip Israel's army says it has targeted the head of Hamas's military wing, Mohammed Deif, during the ongoing strikes on Gaza. A spokesman for the Israel Defense Forces (IDF), Brig Gen Hidai Zilberman, said Israel had tried to assassinate Deif, the head of the Izzedine al-Qassam Brigades. Deif, who has been on the Israeli army's most-wanted list for over two decades, has survived repeated attempts on his life over the years,including in the last major conflict in 2014. Israeli news website Ynet reported that in one of the operations, Deif had been in his bunker when Israel hit the location. He tends to stay in the background and his whereabouts remain unknown. Hamas has not confirmed the reports. A United Nations relief agency has been delivering aid to Gaza Israel has accused a United Nations relief agency of ""cynical misrepresentation"" for suggesting it was preventing humanitarian aid from entering the Gaza Strip. On Tuesday the aid agency for Palestinians, known as UNRWA,called on Israel to enable access to Gaza for humanitarian supplies and its staff.,external The agency said Israel had not approved such access and was therefore failing to meet its obligations under international law. But Israel's foreign ministry denied this in a statement on Wednesday. It said rocket fire from Palestinian militants in Gaza, not Israel, had halted the transfer of humanitarian aid on Tuesday and Wednesday. âUNRWAâs claim that Israel is preventing humanitarian aid from reaching Gaza is a cynical misrepresentation and simply a lie,â the statement said. ""Israel will continue its efforts to co-ordinate the transfer of humanitarian aid into Gaza, taking into account security considerations.â As the fighting enters its 10th day, and air strikes and rocket fire continue, let's take a look at what triggered the latest violence. It was sparked by days of escalating clashes between Palestinians and Israeli police at a holy hilltop compound in East Jerusalem earlier this month. The site is revered by both Muslims, who call it the Haram al-Sharif (Noble Sanctuary), and Jews, for whom it is known as the Temple Mount. Hamas demanded Israel remove police from there and the nearby predominantly Arab district of Sheikh Jarrah, where Palestinian families face eviction by Jewish settlers. Hamas launched rockets when its ultimatum went unheeded. Palestinian anger was further fuelled by Israel's annual celebration of its capture of East Jerusalem in the 1967 Middle East war, known as Jerusalem Day. The fate of the city, with its deep religious and national significance to both sides, lies at the heart of the decades-old Israel-Palestinian conflict. Prime Minister Boris Johnson vowed to root out anti-Semitism in the UK Now let's turn to the UK, where Prime Minister Boris Johnson has condemned a spike in anti-Semitic incidents in the country since the Israel-Gaza conflict began. Johnson was asked what he would do to support Jewish communities in the UK during questioning by opposition leader Sir Keir Starmer in parliament. ""I share his horror at the outbreak of anti-Semitic incidents and the government has conveyed that message loud and clear to those who are responsible for enforcing the law against hate crime,"" Johnson said. He said anti-Semitism must be called out ""at every stage"", adding: ""We will not let it take root, we will not allow it to grow and fester."" His comments came after 116 anti-Semitic incidents were reported over 11 days from 8 May in the UK - a five-fold increase on the previous period. Those incidents were recorded by the Community Security Trust (CST), which offers safety advice to the Jewish community in the UK. Recent incidents dealt with by the police includean attack on Rabbi Rafi Goodwin near his synagogue in north London. Hossein Salami says Palestinians have emerged as a ""missile-equipped nation"" The head of Iran's Islamic Revolution Guard Corps (IRGC) has said that Iran backs the Palestinians against what it calls the ""Zionist regime"" (Israel). In a televised address, Hossein Salami said the conflict showed that ""Palestinians have emerged as a missile-equipped nation."" Iran is a major supporter of Hamas, which it backs financially and militarily. The two sides fell out after Hamas refused to support Iran's ally, Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, in Syria's civil war. But the two sides have since reconciled. An escalation of fighting between Israelis and Palestinians has led the United Nations to warn of a ""full-scale war"". The latest violence followed weeks of rising tensions in Jerusalem, though the conflict has gone on for decades. Here's our explainer, looking at the key issues. The Israeli military has continued to carry out air strikes in Gaza in response to rocket fire from Palestinian militants Following news of Joe Biden's call for a ""de-escalation"", a Hamas spokesman in Gaza, Hazem Qassem, has told reporters that Israel has been refusing to engage with diplomatic efforts to end the violence. ""There are no specific dates for the issue of the ceasefire, because all the international efforts that are being made, as well as the Egyptian efforts, are met with an Israeli position that refuses to deal with ceasefire initiatives,"" he said. He told Reuters news agency that if Israel ended its ""bombardment on Gaza... there can be room to talk about
arrangements to restore calm"". Netanyahu has reaffirmed his commitment to Israeli strikes on Palestinian militants in Gaza Israeli's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has vowed to continue his government's operation against Palestinian militantsin a video statement posted to Twitter a short time ago,external. His comments came shortly after a phone call with US President Joe Biden, who told him to move towards de-escalation. While Netanyahu did not comment on the call, he said he appreciated Bidenâs support of Israelâs right to defend itself. However, he added: ""I am determined to continue this operation until its goal is achieved - to bring back peace and security to you, the citizens of Israel."" Diplomatic calls for a ceasefire have so far proved fruitless. BBC OS Two Israeli Arabs have told the BBC about their experiences of living in Israel since the fighting began Each day this week, we've been speaking to the different communities affected by the Israel-Gaza conflict. On Wednesday, we heard from friends Khadija and Adrieh, two Israeli Arab women.. Israeli Arabs are people who live in Israel but strongly identify with Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank. Both young mums, Khadija and Adrieh grew up together in Jaffa, a city with mixed communities of people with Palestinian and Jewish backgrounds. Since the fighting began, there have been flare-ups of intercommunal violence between Israeli Arabs and Jews across Israel. Khadija told the BBC she was afraid to go out and live her life as usual. ""Itâs not new to be afraid to be an Arab woman here in Israel, but itâs very new to me to be afraid to walk in my neighbourhood,"" she said. ""If you canât feel safe in your country, you canât feel like you belong to this country."" You can hear more from Khadija and Adrieh bylistening to BBC OS programme on World Service radio. The US has again said it will not back a French-proposed UN Security Council draft resolution calling for a ceasefire, stressing that it could undermine efforts to de-escalate the crisis, the AFP news agency reports. ""We've been clear and consistent that we are focused on intensive diplomatic efforts under way to bring an end to the violence and that we will not support actions that we believe undermine efforts to de-escalate,"" a US spokesperson at the UN told the news agency. The US is one of the five permanent UN Security Council members with a veto power. Earlier on Wednesday, US President Joe Biden told Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu in a phone conversation that he expected ""a significant de-escalation today on the path to a ceasefire"". This video can not be played MSF: Violence is curbing healthcare access in Gaza Dr Natalie Thurtle from medical NGO Doctors Without Borders (MSF) has been telling the BBC how her organisation has been struggling to provide medical care on the ground amid the continuing violence. âThe border to Gaza is closed and no humanitarian corridor has been negotiated,â she said, calling for an end to the fighting. Palestinians in Gaza, meanwhile, are ""frightened, their children are frightened, they are hiding in the basement every night"", she says. Barbara Plett UsherBBC News, Wilmington This is the first time that US President Joe Biden has directly and publicly pressed Israel for a ceasefire - or spoken with such urgency. Until now, he had been stressing Israelâs right to defend itself and insisting that Hamas stop its rocket fire. Today he told Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that this has to be the beginning of the end, to significantly wind down the Israeli operation on the way to a ceasefire. He linked his comments to what he said was progress in degrading Hamas' capabilities, and to the state of affairs in Gaza, which is facing a deepening humanitarian crisis. There's been increasing political and international pressure on Mr Biden to intervene more forcefully to push for an end to the violence. With another UN Security Council meeting set for tomorrow, he seems to be indicating that the US is becoming less willing to give Israel diplomatic cover. An area in the city of Shfaram in northern Israel is cordoned off after rockets were fired from Lebanon If you're just joining our coverage of the renewed fighting between Israel and Palestinian militants, here are the latest developments: Nine-year-old Yara (left) and five-year-old Rula (right) were killed alongside several family members on Sunday Of the 219 people killed in Gaza at least 63 are children, according to its health ministry, while of the 10 people killed in Israel, two children are among the dead, the country's medical service says. Among the children killed in Gaza were sisters Yara, 9, and Rula, 5 from the al-Kawalek family. Both had been receiving treatment for trauma from the Norwegian Refugee Council (NRC). The al-Kawaleks were polite girls who always did their homework on time, one of their teachers, who did not want be named, told the BBC. Ido Avigal, five, who was killed in a Hamas rocket attack The youngest victim on the Israeli side is thought to be Ido Avigal, a five-year-old boy killed last Wednesday in the southern town of Sderot. Ido was killed inside a fortified room in what the Israeli military described as an ""incredibly rare"" incident. Rocket shrapnel pierced the protective metal plating used to cover the window of the room he was in, also injuring his mother and seven-year-old sister. He died of his injuries hours later. Ibrahim al-Masry was playing with his siblings in the front yard of their home in a northern neighbourhood of Gaza last week, when a strike hit, according to reports. ""We were laughing and having fun, when suddenly they began to bomb us, everything around us caught fire,"" his brothertold the AFP news agency,external. You can read more about the children who have died in the fightinghere. This video can not be played John Dugard: US not an honest broker in Israel-Gaza conflict John Dugard, a former United Nations Special Rapporteur to the UNHCR, has told the BBC that he believes the US is ""not an honest broker"" in the Israel-Gaza conflict. ""First of all there's the evidence provided by the failure of United States to support a [UN Security Council] resolution at this stage,"" Mr Dugard said. ""Secondly there's the fact that the US continues to operate its embassy from Jerusalem, which is contrary to international law."" The US has called for a ceasefire, but it has been blocking attempts by the UN Security Council to issue a joint statement, saying this would not help with the de-escalation of hostilities. We reported yesterday that two men from Thailand working at a packaging factory in southern Israel had been killed by Palestinian rocket-fire. The two men, who were employed at the Obad farming estate in Eshkol town, have been named as Sikharin Sangamram, 24, and Weerawat Karanborirak, 44. Israel's Kan News tweeted images of the two men.

At least eight other Thai workers were wounded in yesterday's rocket attack, Thailand's foreign ministry said. It's not unusual for citizens of Thailand to seek work in Israel, and the two countries have a good relationship. A senior Thai diplomat in Israel told the BBC that around 4,000 of the country's citizens had been working in southern Israel when the latest conflict erupted, but that some were relocated to safer areas over the weekend. Paul AdamsBBC diplomatic correspondent, Jerusalem As we reported earlier, US President Joe Biden spoke to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on the phone, telling him he expected a ""significant de-escalation today"". The tone of that call suggests the US is losing patience with Israelâs military attacks. With another UN Security Council meeting looming on Thursday, the White House is indicating that it may be less willing to offer diplomatic cover to Israel, one of its closest allies. Speaking to foreign ambassadors this morning, Netanyahu said it was not possible to set a timeframe on the operation in Gaza. Last night, local reports in Israel suggested a ceasefire could be announced as early as Thursday morning. But these reports have not been confirmed. Â© 2025 BBC.

Until now, he had been stressing Israelâs right to defend itself and insisting that Hamas stop its rocket fire. Today he told Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that this has to be the beginning of the end, to significantly wind down the Israeli operation on the way to a ceasefire. He linked his comments to what he said was progress in degrading Hamas' capabilities, and to the state of affairs in Gaza, which is facing a deepening humanitarian crisis. There's been increasing political and international pressure on Mr Biden to intervene more forcefully to push for an end to the violence. With another UN Security Council meeting set for tomorrow, he seems to be indicating that the US is becoming less willing to give Israel diplomatic cover. An area in the city of Shfaram in northern Israel is cordoned off after rockets were fired from Lebanon If you're just joining our coverage of the renewed fighting between Israel and Palestinian militants, here are the latest developments: Nine-year-old Yara (left) and five-year-old Rula (right) were killed alongside several family members on Sunday Of the 219 people killed in Gaza at least 63 are children, according to its health ministry, while of the 10 people killed in Israel, two children are among the dead, the country's medical service says. Among the children killed in Gaza were sisters Yara, 9, and Rula, 5 from the al-Kawalek family. Both had been receiving treatment for trauma from the Norwegian Refugee Council (NRC). The al-Kawaleks were polite girls who always did their homework on time, one of their teachers, who did not want be named, told the BBC. Ido Avigal, five, who was killed in a Hamas rocket attack The youngest victim on the Israeli side is thought to be Ido Avigal, a five-year-old boy killed last Wednesday in the southern town of Sderot. Ido was killed inside a fortified room in what the Israeli military described as an ""incredibly rare"" incident. Rocket shrapnel pierced the protective metal plating used to cover the window of the room he was in, also injuring his mother and seven-year-old sister. He died of his injuries hours later. Ibrahim al-Masry was playing with his siblings in the front yard of their home in a northern neighbourhood of Gaza last week, when a strike hit, according to reports. ""We were laughing and having fun, when suddenly they began to bomb us, everything around us caught fire,"" his brothertold the AFP news agency,external. You can read more about the children who have died in the fightinghere. This video can not be played John Dugard: US not an honest broker in Israel-Gaza conflict John Dugard, a former United Nations Special Rapporteur to the UNHCR, has told the BBC that he believes the US is ""not an honest broker"" in the Israel-Gaza conflict. ""First of all there's the evidence provided by the failure of United States to support a [UN Security Council] resolution at this stage,"" Mr Dugard said. ""Secondly there's the fact that the US continues to operate its embassy from Jerusalem, which is contrary to international law."" The US has called for a ceasefire, but it has been blocking attempts by the UN Security Council to issue a joint statement, saying this would not help with the de-escalation of hostilities. We reported yesterday that two men from Thailand working at a packaging factory in southern Israel had been killed by Palestinian rocket-fire. The two men, who were employed at the Obad farming estate in Eshkol town, have been named as Sikharin Sangamram, 24, and Weerawat Karanborirak, 44. Israel's Kan News tweeted images of the two men.

At least eight other Thai workers were wounded in yesterday's rocket attack, Thailand's foreign ministry said. It's not unusual for citizens of Thailand to seek work in Israel, and the two countries have a good relationship. A senior Thai diplomat in Israel told the BBC that around 4,000 of the country's citizens had been working in southern Israel when the latest conflict erupted, but that some were relocated to safer areas over the weekend. Paul AdamsBBC diplomatic correspondent, Jerusalem As we reported earlier, US President Joe Biden spoke to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on the phone, telling him he expected a ""significant de-escalation today"". The tone of that call suggests the US is losing patience with Israelâs military attacks. With another UN Security Council meeting looming on Thursday, the White House is indicating that it may be less willing to offer diplomatic cover to Israel, one of its closest allies. Speaking to foreign ambassadors this morning, Netanyahu said it was not possible to set a timeframe on the operation in Gaza. Last night, local reports in Israel suggested a ceasefire could be announced as early as Thursday morning. But these reports have not been confirmed. Â© 2025 BBC.

BBC One Match of the Day is on now. Go, go, go! FT: West Brom 1-3 West Ham West Bromwich Albion West Brom's Kyle Bartley, speaking to Sky Sports:""Sam Allardyce has literally just told us as we got in the dressing room. It's a bit of a shock. I think most of us expected he would be here next season. ""He just said that he had come to a decision that he won't be here next year. He thinks the club would be in better hands going in a different direction. ""I thought he would have been fantastic for us next year. I'd have thought we would have a really good chance of going back up. But I fully respect his decision."" FT: West Brom 1-3 West Ham West Ham United West Ham boss David Moyes, speaking to Sky Sports:""We played well in recent games, we didn't play well tonight but we got the goals we needed."" A point on Sunday would secure sixth and Europa League, how does that sound?""It sounds great. I am quite calm about it because I know we have to still go and earn it. ""Overall we have earned it this year but we have a bit to do yet and hopefully we can get over the line."" Allardyce leaves West Brom West Bromwich Albion More from Sam Allardyce, speaking to BBC Sport: ""I am very pleased that West Brom wanted me to stay. I am not long term. They need long term. They need planning for next season to get back up and beyond. ""My statement has distracted from my team's performance tonight. As a team I cannot thank the players enough for being tactically so good. They were brilliant tactically against Liverpool, which they got no credit for, and they were very good tactically today. ""Very pleased with a great footballing performance."" On why he is not a long term manager: ""You all know I am short term manager, you have all seen me like that for last six years. That is me, that is where I lie and that is what you continue to think. ""I just want to say to West Brom fans I am sad I did not keep you up, someone else will come in."" Will he stay in management?""One never knows. I am not in charge of what job I am going to take. I cannot demand a job anytime I feel like it."" West Bromwich Albion Sam Allardyce to the fans: ""I'm sad I've not kept you up. I loved you being here today and I felt the atmosphere which was fantastic."" West Brom 1-3 West ham West Bromwich Albion Departing West Brom boss Sam Allardyce, speaking to Sky Sports:""For me it is a long term prospect for somebody more than me. I am as you always say a man that comes and saves a club, a man who is short term. I am happy with that. That is my life for the last few years. ""I think it needs someone to take the club by the scruff of the net and take them up. I thank the club for the opportunity to stay and I'd like to thank the fans cheering us on tonight. ""I haven't been more than that [a firefighter] for the last six or seven years because that is all you lot talk about. ""If you thought that was long ball today then somebody is deluded. ""I have made that decision, a very difficult decision to make on the basis of what West Brom. I didn't expect to come here to be talking about this, I expected to come here talking to you with a chance of staying up with a game or two to go. ""I am my own man. That is who I am.

I haven't heard from you for a long time! Tell your boss, he's probably watching, here I am!"" FT: Burnley 0-3 Liverpool Liverpool More from Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp to BBC: ""It never was easy. I can't remember an easy game against Burnley. What a job Sean Dyche is doing here. The way they play is so tricky to defend against. They are smart. Apart from a nervy start passing-wise, we had to adapt to the atmosphere in the stadium, but then we played really good football. ""We scored a wonderful goal. In the second half they started again with the highest intensity. Alisson was constantly under pressure on the set-pieces. It's just tricky. You cannot deny them all the time and you have to score in the chances. Nat Phillips had a really great header and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain had really nice skill. An important goal for him. I'm really happy."" On the future of the two young centre-backs: ""The chance [Rhys Williams and Phillips] got now and how they used it... These kinds of things make careers. I don't think many would have thought Phillips would be a starter for Liverpool and now he scores. It's very nice. ""But it's too early to talk about it. In this position we have to wrap them up in cotton wool and go again. There is nothing decided yet but we have another final which we have again. ""After a long, long time we didn't really know where we would end. Now we are in a European league and we need to secure the Champions League on the last day. There are really important football games on the last day."" Allardyce leaves West Brom Leon OsmanFormer Everton midfielder on BBC Radio 5 Live Sam Allardyce gave West Brom a good go and it's the first time he has been relegated. No-one at the club will be saying it's Allardyce's fault. I wondered during the game... He looked enthusiastic and I would be surprised if this was his last role. FT: Burnley 0-3 Liverpool Liverpool Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp to Sky Sports:""It was a semi-final. We had to win the semi-final and we did. Nothing is decided yet but we improved our position and we have the final. That's what we needed. It's what we deserve because this was a top performance. ""You can't give any chance away against Burnley because of the way they play. They wanted to go for our centre-halves but our boys did outstandingly well. ""We knew before the game it would be incredibly tough - they had about 3,500 people not on our side. Atmosphere in football is massive. ""I thought the boys dealed really well with that. They didn't get distracted - they tried to use it because noise is nice. We played a lot of good football stuff."" On whether they wanted a big win to boost goal difference: ""No. We saw it as a semi-final. You can't go to Burnley and hope to win 3-0. It's usually incredibly tight. ""We have to make sure we recover quickly. We have a thin squad in some positions. We have to wrap them in cotton wool. I can't wait for the 10,00 fans at Anfield. Nothing is decided - Palace are strong."" FT: Burnley 0-3 Liverpool Liverpool Liverpool defender Andy Robertson on BBC Radio 5 live: ""I don't care if it is our fans singing our names, or getting abuse off Burnley fans - fans make football. We have seen that, there is more tempo to the game and fight - and fans bring that. ""We have seen over the last couple of weeks how big fans are in football. Maybe we took it for granted - we will never do that again."" Allardyce leaves West Brom West Bromwich Albion Full statement from Sam Allardyce on the club's official website: ""West Brom made me a generous offer to stay at The Hawthorns that shows the commitment of an ambitious club. After serious consideration I have decided not to accept that offer. ""If I were to stay and achieve promotion next season the expectation would be for me to continue for at least another season and, sadly, that is not a commitment I feel able to make at this stage of my career. ""I believe the club now needs stability and continuity and this would, in my opinion, best be provided by a young and ambitious manager who can get us back to where we should be as an established Premier League football club. ""I must thank the players and staff, in particular Luke Dowling and Ken (Xu Ke), for their unwavering commitment to a very difficult challenge during my time at the club. This challenge was made all the more difficult, of course, by the enforced absence of the clubâs fantastic supporters, some of whom I am delighted were present for our final home game against West Ham United. ""The club have asked for my opinion on the qualities my successor will require and I have been more than happy to offer my thoughts. The search for my replacement starts after the final game of the season at Leeds United. In the meantime, we will be concentrating fully on the preparation for that game and will do everything we can to finish the season with as many points as possible."" West Bromwich Albion Sam Allardyceâs long-time assistant Sammy Lee and first team coach Robbie Stockdale will also depart. West Bromwich Albion West Brom have confirmed Sam Allardyce will step down from his post as head coach at the end of the season. FT: Burnley 0-3 Liverpool Burnley Burnley boss Sean Dyche to BBC: ""We've had a really tough season. We've had some knocks on the way. Liverpool are a good outfit. I thought we gave a good account of ourselves. We have actually played pretty well over the last few weeks but we haven't taken our chances. ""We could have been effective in the final third when it really counts. That's probably been my biggest bug."" On having the fans back: ""It's a good sign of what's to come hopefully for all. They have seen their players put a shift in tonight as they always do. On plans in the summer:  ""There's always a lot to do here. It's a restart every summer. We will see what happens and what can be done investment wise. We have a base here to work on and it's how we layer up on top of that to find the next generation of players to keep moving forward."" The latest on Dyche's future: ""The latest is it's eight and a half years and I'm still here."" FT: Burnley 0-3 Liverpool Burnley Burnley boss Sean Dyche to Sky Sports:""They're a clinical side. They're back purring. They showed that in patches. ""We created enough to score a goal. That's been our nemesis this season. They opened us up enough to win the game. ""There's talk about us playing a certain way but we want to be effective. We probably had more possession and created more chances than we have in a lot of games. ""I don't want to be hyper-critical. It's been a funny league this season. ""It's briliant to have people in here. We hope it bodes well for the future - not just in football."" On next season: ""We'll see if that [squad] changes in the summer with new owners. I don't think it'll be something radical but maybe something."" On himself: ""I'm cool. People have been asking me that for years but I'm still here eight and a half years later."" Leon OsmanFormer Everton midfielder on BBC Radio 5 Live It's been a tremendous season for West Ham considering where they were last season. David Moyes came in and he has started to get the club to where they want to be. People always seem to question David Moyes and his ability, but he is a great Premier League football manager. He knows how to win games, and it is no surprise to see West Ham in the European positions. FT: West Brom 1-3 West Ham West Ham United West Ham's Angelo Ogbonna:""We showed West Ham's character. It was a fantastic game. We knew this game could be really dangerous for us but we stuck at it and got the win. ""I wasn't really concentrating on Tottenham's result because we had to do our game and then see what we can achieve. We showed our character. ""I can't wait to see our fans. Without fans football is nothing. We are not really concentrating on the position but the performance. Hopefully we get the three points and we will see what we can achieve."" Â© 2025 BBC.

"There has been growing scrutiny of the government's decision to put India on the red list, weeks after neighbouring Pakistan and Bangladesh. They were placed on the list on 9 April and India was added on the 23 April - days after Boris Johnson cancelled his trade visit to the country. Asked in Parliament, on Monday, 17 May, why India had not been added earlier, Health Secretary Matt Hancock replied: ""The truth is that when we put Pakistan and Bangladesh on the red list, positivity among those arriving from those countries was three times higher than it was among those arriving from India."" But Mr Hancock's claim is not supported by the publicly availableNHS Test and Trace figures,external. They show that between 25 March and 7 April, the proportion of travellers testing positive for coronavirus on arrival in the UK were: from Bangladesh 3.7% from India 5.1% from Pakistan 6.2% Thegovernment announced its decision,externalto add Bangladesh and Pakistan to the red list, on 2 April Why was India not put on the red list sooner? What are the India, Brazil, South Africa and UK variants? We asked the Department of Health whether figures from a different source support Mr Hancock's claim - but it has not answered the question. A spokesperson said: ""All decisions on red, amber or green list assignment and our border regime are taken by ministers based on regular scrutiny of the latest scientific data, the Joint Biosecurity Centre's  risk assessment and wider public health factors."" In response to an earlier request for evidence, the Department of Health told us that the only published datacovered 26 March to 22 April but not more precisely,externalthe point when Pakistan and Bangladesh were added to the red list. Thanks to Ed Conway, at Sky News,,externalwho managed to find the dataset for the period between 25 March and 7 April, which also reveals about half of positive tests from people arriving from the three countries were being sent for genome sequencing to identify variants of concern (VOC) or variants under investigation (VUI). At the time, the variant identified in India was neither a VUI nor a VOC, so the tests were looking for the variants identified in South Africa and Brazil. And the proportions in which they were found were: from Bangladesh 75% from India 52% from Pakistan 2% On 19 May, the health secretary was asked about his claim - and what the Test and Trace figures show - in Parliament. Mr Hancock said: ""The positivity rate in India, on which the decision to put Pakistan but not India on the red list was 1.6% in India and 4.6% in Pakistan, which is three times higher, as I said."" But those are not published figures. He did not give the date for them (so we cannot tell how rapidly India's rate climbed to the 5.1% recorded by 7 April) and he did not mention Bangladesh this time. The statistical regulatorhas been clear,externalthat when unpublished information is ""used publicly to inform Parliament, the media and the public, it should be published"". Update:Since this piece was published on 19 May,new government figures,externalhave been released on the positivity rate of travellers arriving in the UK. In one period - from 25 February to 10 March - the rate for arrivals from India was 1.6% compared with 5.0% from Pakistan and 1.5% from Bangladesh. However, these figures do not show that Bangladesh's rate was three times that of India's, as Mr Hancock claimed on 17 May. The Department of Health has told us that the figures they prepare for ministers covered the period 3 March to 17 March and these are what the health secretary was referring to. These figures have not been published. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself?

"This video can not be played A UK-Australia trade deal would be the âfinal nail in the coffin"" for Scottish crofters, says SNP's Ian Blackford Boris Johnson is prepared ""to throw farmers and crofters under the Brexit bus"" in his bid to secure a trade deal with Australia, the SNP's leader in Westminster has said. Ian Blackford urged the PM to rule out giving Australia tariff - or tax-free - access for its lamb and beef products. Mr Johnson replied that an agreement with Australia would be a ""massive opportunity"" for UK farmers. The Scottish government has written to the trade secretary about its concerns. Rural affairs secretary Mairi Gougeon wrote: ""A trade deal that liberalises tariffs for Australian farmers, to put it bluntly, will put UK farmers out of business."" There are also reported tensions among ministers over the proposed trade pact. Currently imports from Australia face tariffs, making their products more expensive to buy in the UK. Australia is one of a number of countries the UK is negotiating with to remove or lower tariffs, following its departure from the EU. First minister to raise Australia trade deal fears How much power do UK farmers have over trade deals? How many trade deals has the UK done? The BBC has been told that Environment Secretary George Eustice has raised a number of concerns with the prime minister and senior cabinet ministers about the deal trading away farmers' interests. Andthe Financial Times reported,externalthat Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove is also concerned, while International Trade Secretary Liz Truss and Brexit minister Lord Frost are more keen to grant tariff-free access to Australian goods. Speaking to MPs on Wednesday, Ms Truss said she was confident British farmers would ""thrive"" under a deal with Australia, adding it would have ""benefits for all nations and regions"" of the UK. Negotiators from both sides are ""currently in a sprint with a view to getting to agreement in principle by early June,"" she added. One compromise Mr Eustice has suggested is to negotiate quotas on Australian meat imports - so that only a limited amount could be tariff-free. Labour first minister of Wales Mark Drakefordwill raise concernsabout the impact of a deal on Welsh farmers in a meeting with Mr Gove later. Senior UK cabinet ministers are expected to meet on Thursday morning to discuss how the agreement could impact farming. The subject was raised at Prime Minister's Questions, where Mr Blackford - himself a crofter - said a tariff-free deal with Australia ""would be the final nail in the coffin for many Scottish crofters and farmers"". He added it would ""end a way of life that has endured for generations"" and that ""families would be driven off the land"". He urged Mr Johnson to ""permanently"" rule out signing up to an agreement that would guarantee tariff-free access for Australian imports of lamb and beef. The prime minister did not give the guarantee, instead accusing Mr Blackford of ""grossly underestimating"" UK farmers' ability to ""make the most of free trade"". And he said the SNP MP was ""frightened of free trade"". The prime minister also face criticism from Plaid Cymru's Hywel Williams who said Mr Johnson was backing Australian instead of UK farmers. Mr Johnson said the MP had ""no ambition for Welsh farmers"" and that it was ""a disgrace that not a single morsel of Welsh lamb had passed the lips of Americans in the last 20 years"". Minette Batters, the president of the National Farmers' Union, said: ""We know that if we're to open up the opportunities of new markets overseas for UK farmers, we will have to offer greater access to our own markets in return. ""However, this trade-off needs to be balanced, and we need to make sure concessions to our hugely valuable home market are not given away lightly. ""There is a very real risk that, if we get it wrong, UK farming will suffer irreversible damage rather than flourish in the way we all desire, to the detriment of our environment, our food security and our rural communities."" The government says our ability to do trade deals around the world is one of the big benefits of Brexit. They've been trumpeting all sorts of deals over the last year but those deals are basically roll-overs of what we had before as members of the EU. The deal with Australia would be the first big deal to expand markets, so it is politically and symbolically important but at what price? Australia wants tax-free access to our markets for their big industrial farms so they can export lamb and sheep more cheaply. But famers here are saying we wouldn't be able to survive that competition unless we are protected by tariffs. They say a free trade deal would only add a tiny bit to the size of the British economy so is it really worth threatening famers for that. They also say there is also a precedent being set. Australia may be a relatively small market - but if they get a complete tariff-free access then what will the Americans or Brazilians want to have? The UK is Australia's seventh largest trading partner while Australia is the UK's 20th largest trading partner The UK's largest goods export to Australia is cars and trucks (Â£757m) Australia's largest exported good to the UK is lead (Â£267m) The government says a free trade agreement with Australia could increase UK exports to the Australia by up to Â£900m It also estimates a deal would increase workers' wages by 0.02% - 0.07%.

The deal with Australia would be the first big deal to expand markets, so it is politically and symbolically important but at what price? Australia wants tax-free access to our markets for their big industrial farms so they can export lamb and sheep more cheaply. But famers here are saying we wouldn't be able to survive that competition unless we are protected by tariffs. They say a free trade deal would only add a tiny bit to the size of the British economy so is it really worth threatening famers for that. They also say there is also a precedent being set. Australia may be a relatively small market - but if they get a complete tariff-free access then what will the Americans or Brazilians want to have? The UK is Australia's seventh largest trading partner while Australia is the UK's 20th largest trading partner The UK's largest goods export to Australia is cars and trucks (Â£757m) Australia's largest exported good to the UK is lead (Â£267m) The government says a free trade agreement with Australia could increase UK exports to the Australia by up to Â£900m It also estimates a deal would increase workers' wages by 0.02% - 0.07%.

I think most of us expected he would be here next season. ""He just said that he had come to a decision that he won't be here next year.

I can't remember an easy game against Burnley. What a job Sean Dyche is doing here. The way they play is so tricky to defend against. They are smart. Apart from a nervy start passing-wise, we had to adapt to the atmosphere in the stadium, but then we played really good football. ""We scored a wonderful goal. In the second half they started again with the highest intensity. Alisson was constantly under pressure on the set-pieces. It's just tricky. You cannot deny them all the time and you have to score in the chances. Nat Phillips had a really great header and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain had really nice skill. An important goal for him. I'm really happy."" On the future of the two young centre-backs: ""The chance [Rhys Williams and Phillips] got now and how they used it... These kinds of things make careers. I don't think many would have thought Phillips would be a starter for Liverpool and now he scores. It's very nice. ""But it's too early to talk about it. In this position we have to wrap them up in cotton wool and go again. There is nothing decided yet but we have another final which we have again.

Allardyce leaves West Brom Leon OsmanFormer Everton midfielder on BBC Radio 5 Live Sam Allardyce gave West Brom a good go and it's the first time he has been relegated. No-one at the club will be saying it's Allardyce's fault. I wondered during the game... He looked enthusiastic and I would be surprised if this was his last role. FT: Burnley 0-3 Liverpool Liverpool Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp to Sky Sports:""It was a semi-final. We had to win the semi-final and we did. Nothing is decided yet but we improved our position and we have the final. That's what we needed. It's what we deserve because this was a top performance. ""You can't give any chance away against Burnley because of the way they play. They wanted to go for our centre-halves but our boys did outstandingly well. ""We knew before the game it would be incredibly tough - they had about 3,500 people not on our side. Atmosphere in football is massive. ""I thought the boys dealed really well with that. They didn't get distracted - they tried to use it because noise is nice. We played a lot of good football stuff."" On whether they wanted a big win to boost goal difference: ""No. We saw it as a semi-final. You can't go to Burnley and hope to win 3-0. It's usually incredibly tight. ""We have to make sure we recover quickly. We have a thin squad in some positions. We have to wrap them in cotton wool. I can't wait for the 10,00 fans at Anfield. Nothing is decided - Palace are strong."" FT: Burnley 0-3 Liverpool Liverpool Liverpool defender Andy Robertson on BBC Radio 5 live: ""I don't care if it is our fans singing our names, or getting abuse off Burnley fans - fans make football. We have seen that, there is more tempo to the game and fight - and fans bring that. ""We have seen over the last couple of weeks how big fans are in football. Maybe we took it for granted - we will never do that again."" Allardyce leaves West Brom West Bromwich Albion Full statement from Sam Allardyce on the club's official website: ""West Brom made me a generous offer to stay at The Hawthorns that shows the commitment of an ambitious club. After serious consideration I have decided not to accept that offer. ""If I were to stay and achieve promotion next season the expectation would be for me to continue for at least another season and, sadly, that is not a commitment I feel able to make at this stage of my career. ""I believe the club now needs stability and continuity and this would, in my opinion, best be provided by a young and ambitious manager who can get us back to where we should be as an established Premier League football club. ""I must thank the players and staff, in particular Luke Dowling and Ken (Xu Ke), for their unwavering commitment to a very difficult challenge during my time at the club. This challenge was made all the more difficult, of course, by the enforced absence of the clubâs fantastic supporters, some of whom I am delighted were present for our final home game against West Ham United. ""The club have asked for my opinion on the qualities my successor will require and I have been more than happy to offer my thoughts. The search for my replacement starts after the final game of the season at Leeds United. In the meantime, we will be concentrating fully on the preparation for that game and will do everything we can to finish the season with as many points as possible.""

West Bromwich Albion West Brom have confirmed Sam Allardyce will step down from his post as head coach at the end of the season. FT: Burnley 0-3 Liverpool Burnley Burnley boss Sean Dyche to BBC: ""We've had a really tough season. We've had some knocks on the way. Liverpool are a good outfit. I thought we gave a good account of ourselves. We have actually played pretty well over the last few weeks but we haven't taken our chances. ""We could have been effective in the final third when it really counts. That's probably been my biggest bug."" On having the fans back: ""It's a good sign of what's to come hopefully for all. They have seen their players put a shift in tonight as they always do. On plans in the summer:  ""There's always a lot to do here. It's a restart every summer. We will see what happens and what can be done investment wise. We have a base here to work on and it's how we layer up on top of that to find the next generation of players to keep moving forward."" The latest on Dyche's future: ""The latest is it's eight and a half years and I'm still here."" FT: Burnley 0-3 Liverpool Burnley Burnley boss Sean Dyche to Sky Sports:""They're a clinical side. They're back purring. They showed that in patches. ""We created enough to score a goal. That's been our nemesis this season. They opened us up enough to win the game. ""There's talk about us playing a certain way but we want to be effective. We probably had more possession and created more chances than we have in a lot of games. ""I don't want to be hyper-critical. It's been a funny league this season. ""It's briliant to have people in here. We hope it bodes well for the future - not just in football."" On next season: ""We'll see if that [squad] changes in the summer with new owners. I don't think it'll be something radical but maybe something."" On himself: ""I'm cool. People have been asking me that for years but I'm still here eight and a half years later."" Leon OsmanFormer Everton midfielder on BBC Radio 5 Live It's been a tremendous season for West Ham considering where they were last season. David Moyes came in and he has started to get the club to where they want to be. People always seem to question David Moyes and his ability, but he is a great Premier League football manager. He knows how to win games, and it is no surprise to see West Ham in the European positions. FT: West Brom 1-3 West Ham West Ham United West Ham's Angelo Ogbonna:""We showed West Ham's character. It was a fantastic game. We knew this game could be really dangerous for us but we stuck at it and got the win. ""I wasn't really concentrating on Tottenham's result because we had to do our game and then see what we can achieve. We showed our character. ""I can't wait to see our fans.

"This video can not be played A UK-Australia trade deal would be the âfinal nail in the coffin"" for Scottish crofters, says SNP's Ian Blackford Boris Johnson is prepared ""to throw farmers and crofters under the Brexit bus"" in his bid to secure a trade deal with Australia, the SNP's leader in Westminster has said. Ian Blackford urged the PM to rule out giving Australia tariff - or tax-free - access for its lamb and beef products. Mr Johnson replied that an agreement with Australia would be a ""massive opportunity"" for UK farmers. The Scottish government has written to the trade secretary about its concerns. Rural affairs secretary Mairi Gougeon wrote: ""A trade deal that liberalises tariffs for Australian farmers, to put it bluntly, will put UK farmers out of business."" There are also reported tensions among ministers over the proposed trade pact. Currently imports from Australia face tariffs, making their products more expensive to buy in the UK. Australia is one of a number of countries the UK is negotiating with to remove or lower tariffs, following its departure from the EU. First minister to raise Australia trade deal fears How much power do UK farmers have over trade deals? How many trade deals has the UK done? The BBC has been told that Environment Secretary George Eustice has raised a number of concerns with the prime minister and senior cabinet ministers about the deal trading away farmers' interests. Andthe Financial Times reported,externalthat Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove is also concerned, while International Trade Secretary Liz Truss and Brexit minister Lord Frost are more keen to grant tariff-free access to Australian goods. Speaking to MPs on Wednesday, Ms Truss said she was confident British farmers would ""thrive"" under a deal with Australia, adding it would have ""benefits for all nations and regions"" of the UK. Negotiators from both sides are ""currently in a sprint with a view to getting to agreement in principle by early June,"" she added. One compromise Mr Eustice has suggested is to negotiate quotas on Australian meat imports - so that only a limited amount could be tariff-free. Labour first minister of Wales Mark Drakefordwill raise concernsabout the impact of a deal on Welsh farmers in a meeting with Mr Gove later. Senior UK cabinet ministers are expected to meet on Thursday morning to discuss how the agreement could impact farming. The subject was raised at Prime Minister's Questions, where Mr Blackford - himself a crofter - said a tariff-free deal with Australia ""would be the final nail in the coffin for many Scottish crofters and farmers"". He added it would ""end a way of life that has endured for generations"" and that ""families would be driven off the land"". He urged Mr Johnson to ""permanently"" rule out signing up to an agreement that would guarantee tariff-free access for Australian imports of lamb and beef. The prime minister did not give the guarantee, instead accusing Mr Blackford of ""grossly underestimating"" UK farmers' ability to ""make the most of free trade"". And he said the SNP MP was ""frightened of free trade"". The prime minister also face criticism from Plaid Cymru's Hywel Williams who said Mr Johnson was backing Australian instead of UK farmers. Mr Johnson said the MP had ""no ambition for Welsh farmers"" and that it was ""a disgrace that not a single morsel of Welsh lamb had passed the lips of Americans in the last 20 years"". Minette Batters, the president of the National Farmers' Union, said: ""We know that if we're to open up the opportunities of new markets overseas for UK farmers, we will have to offer greater access to our own markets in return. ""However, this trade-off needs to be balanced, and we need to make sure concessions to our hugely valuable home market are not given away lightly. ""There is a very real risk that, if we get it wrong, UK farming will suffer irreversible damage rather than flourish in the way we all desire, to the detriment of our environment, our food security and our rural communities."" The government says our ability to do trade deals around the world is one of the big benefits of Brexit. They've been trumpeting all sorts of deals over the last year but those deals are basically roll-overs of what we had before as members of the EU. The deal with Australia would be the first big deal to expand markets, so it is politically and symbolically important but at what price? Australia wants tax-free access to our markets for their big industrial farms so they can export lamb and sheep more cheaply. But famers here are saying we wouldn't be able to survive that competition unless we are protected by tariffs. They say a free trade deal would only add a tiny bit to the size of the British economy so is it really worth threatening famers for that. They also say there is also a precedent being set.

"The price of Bitcoin fell below $34,000 (Â£24,030) for the first time in three months on Wednesday, after China imposed fresh curbs on crypto-currencies. Beijing banned banks and payment firms from providing services related to crypto-currency transactions. It also warned investors against speculative crypto trading on Tuesday. It follows falls in Bitcoin of more than 10% last week after Tesla said it would no longer accept the currency. On Wednesday afternoon, Bitcoin recovered some ground, although it was still down -10.4% at $38,131. Meanwhile, other digital currencies such as Ether, which acts as the fuel for the Ethereum blockchain network, and Dogecoin lost as much as 22% and 24% respectively. Another big US bank to start trading in Bitcoin Tesla will no longer accept Bitcoin, says Elon Musk Elon Musk scammers make millions in crypto-fraud At the same time, Tesla shares fell more than 3% on Wall Street, possibly because of the electric carmaker's exposure to Bitcoin. The firm, owned by Elon Musk, still holds around $1.5bn worth of the crypto-currency. Crypto-currency trading has been illegal in China since 2019 in order to curb money-laundering. But people are still able to trade in currencies such as Bitcoin online, which has concerned Beijing. Elon Musk said crypto-currency could ""not come at great cost to the environment"" On Tuesday, three state-backed organisations, including the National Internet Finance Association of China, the China Banking Association and the Payment and Clearing Association of China issued a warning on social media. They said consumers would have no protection if they were to incur any losses from crypto-currency investment transactions. They added that recent wild swings in crypto-currency prices ""seriously violate people's asset safety"" and are disrupting the ""normal economic and financial order"". Neil Wilson of Markets.com said: ""China has for some time been putting pressure on the crypto space, but this marks an intensification - other countries might follow now as central banks make strides towards their own digital currencies. ""Until now, Western regulators have been pretty relaxed about Bitcoin, but this might change soon."" In March, Tesla boss Elon Musk announced unexpectedly that the electric carmaker would allow customers to buy cars using Bitcoin. But last week, he did a U-turn and suspended vehicle purchases using Bitcoin because of environmental concerns. His fears centre on Bitcoin mining - the energy-intensive process through which the digital currency is generated, using high-powered computers. It often relies on electricity generated with fossil fuels, particularly coal. ""We are concerned about rapidly increasing use of fossil fuels for Bitcoin mining and transactions, especially coal, which has the worst emissions of any fuel,"" Mr Musk wrote. ""Cryptocurrency is a good idea... but this cannot come at great cost to the environment."" He said the electric carmaker did not intend to sell any of its Bitcoin and intended to reinstate crypto-currency transactions once mining shifted to using more sustainable energy sources. Although the digital currency cannot be traded in China, more than 75% of Bitcoin mining around the world is done in China. For anyone who has followed the crypto-currency scene for a while, the events of recent weeks are a familiar story. Some random event - say, a tweet from Elon Musk announcing Tesla will accept crypto-currency payments - sends Bitcoin to new highs, and people begin to say it's winning mainstream acceptance. Then another random event happens, perhaps a change of course from the Tesla tycoon. It comes tumbling down again, and talk of it going mainstream fades into the background. Last month, in a chatroom on Clubhouse (another phenomenon that seems to be swinging from boom to bust) I expressed some scepticism about crypto-currencies. Up popped a senior figure from London's thriving fintech scene: ""Rory, Rory,"" he chided me, ""crypto is becoming an accepted asset class."" With big City institutions taking an interest, that had a ring of truth - back in April, at least. But this week, the weather had changed, with theFinancial Times,externalreporting ""new doubts among institutional fund managers over the future of crypto-currencies as an asset class"". My mind went back to 2013, when I had first taken an interest in Bitcoin. In a report for Radio 4's PM programme, I had bought a pizza for 0.5 BTC, a tortuous process which had not seemed worth the Â£30 it cost back then - of course, at today's exchange rate, that was a Â£14,000 pizza. I had also writtena blog post headlined ""The Bitcoin Bubble"", in which I tried to mine some lessons from a period when the price of the cryptocurrency shot up from $15 to $276 and then hurtled lower again. I ended a piece  in which I compared the cryptocurrency with 17th-Century Dutch tulips or London houses in the 1980s with this thought: ""Unless and until Bitcoin can be used to buy a sandwich, or be accepted by your friends when you pay them back for a restaurant meal, then it is likely to remain just a playground for geeks and gamblers."" Eight years on, it is still virtually impossible to buy a sandwich with Bitcoin. And why would you want to, when there's a good chance you'll be mocked a few years later - as I've been for my transaction - for giving away an asset that goes on to soar in value?

"This video can not be played Malawi has incinerated thousands of expired coronavirus vaccine doses Health authorities in Malawi have incinerated 19,610 expired doses of the AstraZeneca coronavirus vaccine, saying it will reassure the public that any vaccines they do get are safe. It is the first African country to publicly do this. The World Health Organization initially urged countries not to destroy expired doses but has now changed its advice. Uptake of the vaccine in Malawi has been low and health workers hope the move will increase public confidence. Out of a population of about 18 million people, the country has recorded 34,232 confirmed coronavirus cases and 1,153 deaths. Africa Live: Latest updates on this and other stories Why are vaccines going to waste in Africa? DR Congo in race against time to vaccinate people Malawi received 102,000 doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine it acquired from the African Union on 26 March and used almost 80% of them. But the expiry date on the labels was 13 April and officials say this wasn't enough time to use them all. So in a 30-minute process, officials destroyed thousands of Covid-19 vaccines, leaving behind just broken pieces of the vials holding the liquid. Malawi's Health Minister Khumbize Chiponda (l) helped put the vaccines into a hospital incineration chamber Malawi's principal health secretary told the BBC that it was unfortunate they had to destroy the vaccines but the benefits outweighed the risks. ""When news spread that we had out-of-date vaccines, we noticed that people were not coming to our clinics to get immunised,"" said Dr Charles Mwansambo. ""If we don't burn them, people will think that we are using expired vaccines in our facilities and if they don't come, Covid-19 will hit them hard."" The government says it has adequate stocks of vaccines and has urged everyone over 18 years old to get a jab. In addition to the 102,000 from the African Union, it has received 300,000 doses under the Covax vaccine-sharing facility and 50,000 sourced direct from India. However, future supplies could be threatened by India's decision to halt exports. The vaccines had been taken out of cold storage some time ago On the streets of the capital Lilongwe, some people are worried about the safety of the vaccine. ""I would like to get vaccinated but how sure am I if I go to the hospital I won't be given the expired vaccines?"" shopkeeper Jack Chitete told the BBC. ""I have heard a lot of stories about people getting blood clots and some even dying after getting immunised. Are those people telling lies? If it is the truth, why are we being given the same vaccines?"" asked another shopkeeper, Mphatso Chipenda. The link between the AstraZeneca vaccine and rare blood clots is not yet proven, and health experts say the risk from Covid-19 is far higher. They advise people to get vaccinated if they can. Rare blood clots - what you need to know Malawi is not the only country in Africa to have expired vaccines. The WHO initially asked affected countries to hold onto the vaccines until it could establish whether they could still be used. But it now says vaccines already sent out by the manufacturer with a set expiry date should be destroyed. ""While discarding vaccines is deeply regrettable in the context of any immunisation programme, WHO recommends that these expired doses should be removed from the distribution chain and safely disposed of,""it said in a statement,externalon 17 May. Other vaccines that are currently in use have a shelf life of up to 36 months. The challenge with Covid-19 vaccines is that they have been in use for less than a year and there is no substantive data around their effectiveness after long periods.

"At least 63 children are said to have been killed in Gaza, and two have been killed in Israel Of the 219 people who have been killed in Gaza, at least 63 are children, according to its health ministry. Of the 10 people killed in Israel, two children are among the dead, the country's medical service says. Here are the stories of some of the children who have been killed. Nine-year-old Yara (left) and five-year-old Rula (right) were killed alongside several family members on Sunday When an Israeli strike hit al-Wihda street in central Gaza City early on Sunday, at least 13 members of the extended al-Kawalek family are believed to have been killed, buried in the rubble of their own home. Many of the victims were children, with one said to be as young as six months. ""We saw nothing but smoke,"" one of the surviving members of the family, Sanaa al-Kawalek, told Felesteen Online. ""I couldn't see my son next to me and I was hugging him, but I could see nothing."" The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) described the bombing as ""abnormal"" and said the civilian casualties were unintended. A spokesman said air strikes had caused a tunnel to collapse, bringing houses down with it. Among those killed were sisters Yara, 9, and Rula, 5. Both had been receiving treatment for trauma from the Norwegian Refugee Council (NRC). The al-Kawaleks were polite girls who always did their homework on time, one of their teachers, who did not want be named, told the BBC. A picture circulating online is said to show 10-year-old Aziz al-Kawalek, the only surviving member of his direct family, sitting by his mother's body. Allow Twitter content?

Ido Avigal, five, who was killed in a Hamas rocket attack The youngest victim on the Israeli side is thought to be Ido Avigal, a five-year-old boy killed last Wednesday in the southern town of Sderot. Ido was killed inside a fortified room in what the Israeli military described as an ""incredibly rare"" incident. His mother grabbed him and took him to the fortified room when incoming rocket sirens sounded on Wednesday evening in Sderot, the Times of Israel reports. Rocket shrapnel pierced the protective metal plating used to cover the window of the room he was in, also injuring his mother and seven-year-old sister. He died of his injuries several hours later. ""It was a piece of the rocket that came in at a very specific angle, at a very specific speed and at a very specific point,""IDF spokesman Hidai Zilberman said of the incident,external. ""We were at home and the kids were a little bored, so my wife Shani went with them to her sister's house two buildings over,"" Ido's father, Asaf Avigal, told Channel 13. ""I'm sorry I did not take the shrapnel in your place,""Mr Avigal said at his son's funeral,external. ""A few days ago, you asked me: 'Dad, what will happen if the siren goes off while we are outdoors?' I told you that so long as you were with me you would be protected. I lied."" A few months ago,Mr Avigal and his wife had spoken,externalabout what an especially bright child Ido was, as if he was a 50-year-old in the body of a five-year-old.  He would often urge his father to leave the computer and spend more time with him. ""Enough with the screens - be with me,"" he would say. Ido's mother remains in hospital. Allow Twitter content?

"Damage from an Israeli air strike overnight in Gaza City US President Joe Biden has told Israel's PM Benjamin Netanyahu he expects a ""significant de-escalation"" in the Gaza conflict on Wednesday. Mr Biden wanted a ""path to ceasefire"", the White House said. The US is a staunch ally of Israel and has so far opposed a joint UN Security Council statement on the conflict. In response Mr Netanyahu said he was ""determined to carry on"" until ""calm and security are restored to Israeli citizens"", according to Israeli media. The conflict is in its 10th day, with a continuing exchange of rocket fire from Palestinian militants into Israel and Israeli air strikes on Gaza. On Wednesday, four rockets were also fired from Lebanon into Israel and Israel's military responded by firing artillery shells at ""a number of targets in Lebanese territory"". It was not immediately clear whether this would prove to be a significant escalation. The Israel-Palestinian conflict explained The children who have died in the conflict The Gaza fighting began after weeks of rising Israeli-Palestinian tension in occupied East Jerusalem that culminated in clashes at a holy site revered by both Muslims and Jews. Hamas, which controls Gaza, began firing rockets after warning Israel to withdraw from the site, triggering retaliatory air strikes. At least 227 people, including more than 100 women and children, have been killed in Gaza so far, according to its health ministry. Israel has said at least 150 militants are among those killed in Gaza. Hamas does not give casualty figures for fighters. In Israel 12 people, including two children, have been killed, its medical service says. Israel says some 4,000 rockets have been fired towards its territory by militants in Gaza. On Wednesday morning, Mr Biden held his fourth call with Mr Netanyahu since the conflict started. A statement released by the White House,externalsaid: ""The president conveyed to the prime minister that he expected a significant de-escalation today on the path to a ceasefire."" This video can not be played Ex-UN rapporteur John Dugard: US is not honest broker in Israel-Gaza conflict The US has called before for a truce but has held up any joint UN statement, saying it would not help with de-escalation. The Palestinian representative at the UN, Riyad Mansour, called the Security Council's failure to express a unified position ""shameful"". The latest bid for a council resolution calling for a ceasefire, launched by France, failed on Wednesday when the US said it could ""undermine efforts to de-escalate"". A major foreign policy headache for Biden What the law says about the fighting One Israeli military source told Reuters that Israel was assessing whether conditions were right for a truce. The Ynet news website said that the Israelis were talking with Egyptian mediators. It quoted sources in the Israeli cabinet as saying Israel could achieve its objectives and end the fighting ""within days"". A Hamas leader said that efforts by mediators were ""serious and continuous"" but that Palestinian demands had to be met. Earlier on Wednesday Mr Netanyahu did not appear ready to begin a truce. He said there were ""only two ways that you can deal with"" Hamas. ""You can either conquer them, and that's always an open possibility, or you can deter them, and we are engaged right now in forceful deterrence, but I have to say we don't rule out anything."" The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said there had been renewed rocket fire from Gaza on Wednesday and that its fighter jets had attacked military infrastructure, including tunnels, and the homes of Hamas commanders. The BBC's Rushdi Abualouf in Gaza said two Palestinian militants were killed in Gaza City, as dozens of strikes targeted both it and the southern city of Khan Younis. Israel's Iron Dome anti-missile system intercepted Palestinian rockets throughout the night Gaza City mother of seven Randa Abu Sultan, 45, told AFP news agency: ""My four-year-old son tells me he's scared that if he falls asleep, he'll wake up to find us dead."" IDF spokesman Brig Gen Hidai Zilberman said Israel had tried to assassinate Mohammed Deif, the head of Hamas's military wing, the Izzedine al-Qassam Brigades. Mohammed Deif has survived repeated attempts on his life,including in the last major conflict in 2014. He tends to stay in the background and his whereabouts remain unknown. Sirens sounded across much of south and central Israel on Wednesday. Hamas also targeted an Israeli air base overnight but the IDF said no bases were hit. Israel defends Gaza strategy as death toll mounts Why is Gaza blurry on Google Maps? Of the 3,750 rockets fired from the Gaza Strip since the fighting began, 550 have fallen short in Gaza, according to the IDF. Israel's Iron Dome missile defence system has intercepted about 90% of the rockets that have crossed into Israeli territory, it says. The IDF estimated that at the start of the conflict, Hamas and Islamic Jihad, the two main groups in Gaza, had an arsenal of about 12,000 rockets or mortars. Mr Netanyahu said the Israeli operation had ""set Hamas back by many years"". There has also been unrest within Israel and in the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem, where Palestinians took part in a general strike on Tuesday. There were clashes in several locations. The party of Turkish President Erdogan rejected US accusations of anti-Semitism Separately on Wednesday, Turkey rejected US accusations that President Recep Tayyip Erdogan had made anti-Semitic remarks about Israel. He had accused Israel of ""terrorism"" against the Palestinians and recently said: ""It is in their nature"". State department spokesman Ned Price said the US found the remarks ""reprehensible"". Omer Celik, a spokesman for Mr Erdogan's party, said the president had given very strong messages against anti-Semitism, adding: ""Accusing our president of anti-Semitism is an illogical and untrue approach. This is a lie."" The worst violence in years between Israel and the Palestinian territory of the Gaza Strip has seen dozens killed. It follows a month of spiralling tensions before open conflict broke out. Here is what happened in the lead-up to the fighting. 13 April Clashes erupt in East Jerusalem between Palestinians and Israeli police. Palestinians are angry over barriers which had been placed outside the Damascus Gate entrance to the Jerusalem‘s Old City preventing them from gathering there after prayers at the Old City’s al-Aqsa Mosque on what is the first night of the Islamic holy month of Ramadan. Palestinian discontent had been stoked earlier in the day when President Mahmoud Abbas called off planned elections, implicitly blaming Israel over voting arrangements for Palestinians in East Jerusalem. Hamas - Mr Abbas' Islamist rivals who control Gaza and were running in the elections - react angrily to the postponement. Violence around Damascus Gate and elsewhere in East Jerusalem continues nightly. 15-16 April Rockets are fired from Gaza at Israel, which responds with air strikes after a relative period of calm between Israel and the Palestinian enclave. 19 April Clashes spread to the mixed Arab-Jewish port city of Jaffa, next to Tel Aviv. 20 April In Jerusalem, Jewish youths, angry over a spate of filmed assaults by Palestinians on Orthodox Jews posted on the TikTok video-sharing app, attack Arabs and chant anti-Arab slogans. 23 April Hundreds of ultra-nationalist Jews shouting “Death to Arabs” march towards Damascus Gate in protest at the Arab assaults on Jews. Clashes erupt at the site between Palestinians and police trying to separate the two groups, injuring dozens of people. Violence between Arabs and Jews spreads to other parts of the city. 24 April Militants fire dozens of rockets at Israel from Gaza, drawing retaliatory air strikes. 2 May President Abbas' Fatah faction and Hamas condemn the looming threatened eviction of Palestinian families from their homes in the Sheikh Jarrah district of East Jerusalem by Jewish settlers ahead of a planned court hearing. Hamas calls on Arabs to form “human shields of resistance” there. In the days that follow, police and protesters repeatedly clash at the site as it becomes a focal point for Palestinian anger. 4 May Militants in Gaza begin sending incendiary balloons into Israel over successive days, causing dozens of fires. 7 May Two Palestinian gunmen are shot dead and a third is wounded after opening fire on Israeli security forces in the northern West Bank. Israeli authorities say the group planned to carry out a “major attack” in Israel. Later on after Friday prayers - the last of Ramadan - major clashes erupt at the al-Aqsa mosque compound, injuring more than 200 people. Israel's police force says it used “riot dispersal means”, firing rubber bullets and stun grenades after officers came under a hail of stones and bottles. 8 May A second night of violence erupts in East Jerusalem after tens of thousands of worshippers prayed at the al-Aqsa mosque for Laylat al-Qadr, the holiest night of Ramadan. Police and protesters clash at Damascus Gate, with police using water cannon, rubber bullets and tear gas against crowds of Palestinians, some throwing stones. More than 120 Palestinians and some 17 police are injured. 9 May Israel's Supreme Court postpones the hearing on the Sheikh Jarrah case following calls to delay it because of the growing unrest. Tensions remain high though and more clashes take place between Israeli police and Palestinians in Sheikh Jarrah and at Damascus Gate. 10 May Early morning clashes break out between police and Palestinians at the al-Aqsa mosque compound, where crowds throw stones and officers fire stun grenades. Palestinian anger has been inflamed by an annual Jerusalem Day march planned for later in the day by hundreds of Israeli nationalists to celebrate Israel's capture of East Jerusalem in 1967. The march is due to pass through predominantly Arab parts of the Old City in what is seen by Palestinians as a deliberate provocation. It is rerouted at the 11th hour, but the atmosphere remains volatile with more than 300 Palestinians and some 21 police injured in the violence at the holy site. Hamas issues an ultimatum to Israel to “withdraw its soldiers... from the blessed al-Aqsa mosque and Sheikh Jarrah” by 18:00. When the deadline passes without an Israeli response, rockets are fired towards Jerusalem for the first time in years. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says the group has “crossed a red line” and Israel retaliates with air strikes, killing three Hamas fighters. A continuing exchange of rocket-fire and air strikes quickly escalates into the fiercest hostilities between the two sides since they fought a war in 2014.

"This video can not be played A UK-Australia trade deal would be the âfinal nail in the coffin"" for Scottish crofters, says SNP's Ian Blackford Boris Johnson is prepared ""to throw farmers and crofters under the Brexit bus"" in his bid to secure a trade deal with Australia, the SNP's leader in Westminster has said. Ian Blackford urged the PM to rule out giving Australia tariff - or tax-free - access for its lamb and beef products. Mr Johnson replied that an agreement with Australia would be a ""massive opportunity"" for UK farmers. The Scottish government has written to the trade secretary about its concerns. Rural affairs secretary Mairi Gougeon wrote: ""A trade deal that liberalises tariffs for Australian farmers, to put it bluntly, will put UK farmers out of business."" There are also reported tensions among ministers over the proposed trade pact. Currently imports from Australia face tariffs, making their products more expensive to buy in the UK. Australia is one of a number of countries the UK is negotiating with to remove or lower tariffs, following its departure from the EU. First minister to raise Australia trade deal fears How much power do UK farmers have over trade deals? How many trade deals has the UK done? The BBC has been told that Environment Secretary George Eustice has raised a number of concerns with the prime minister and senior cabinet ministers about the deal trading away farmers' interests. Andthe Financial Times reported,externalthat Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove is also concerned, while International Trade Secretary Liz Truss and Brexit minister Lord Frost are more keen to grant tariff-free access to Australian goods. Speaking to MPs on Wednesday, Ms Truss said she was confident British farmers would ""thrive"" under a deal with Australia, adding it would have ""benefits for all nations and regions"" of the UK. Negotiators from both sides are ""currently in a sprint with a view to getting to agreement in principle by early June,"" she added. One compromise Mr Eustice has suggested is to negotiate quotas on Australian meat imports - so that only a limited amount could be tariff-free. Labour first minister of Wales Mark Drakefordwill raise concernsabout the impact of a deal on Welsh farmers in a meeting with Mr Gove later. Senior UK cabinet ministers are expected to meet on Thursday morning to discuss how the agreement could impact farming. The subject was raised at Prime Minister's Questions, where Mr Blackford - himself a crofter - said a tariff-free deal with Australia ""would be the final nail in the coffin for many Scottish crofters and farmers"". He added it would ""end a way of life that has endured for generations"" and that ""families would be driven off the land"". He urged Mr Johnson to ""permanently"" rule out signing up to an agreement that would guarantee tariff-free access for Australian imports of lamb and beef. The prime minister did not give the guarantee, instead accusing Mr Blackford of ""grossly underestimating"" UK farmers' ability to ""make the most of free trade"". And he said the SNP MP was ""frightened of free trade"". The prime minister also face criticism from Plaid Cymru's Hywel Williams who said Mr Johnson was backing Australian instead of UK farmers. Mr Johnson said the MP had ""no ambition for Welsh farmers"" and that it was ""a disgrace that not a single morsel of Welsh lamb had passed the lips of Americans in the last 20 years"". Minette Batters, the president of the National Farmers' Union, said: ""We know that if we're to open up the opportunities of new markets overseas for UK farmers, we will have to offer greater access to our own markets in return. ""However, this trade-off needs to be balanced, and we need to make sure concessions to our hugely valuable home market are not given away lightly. ""There is a very real risk that, if we get it wrong, UK farming will suffer irreversible damage rather than flourish in the way we all desire, to the detriment of our environment, our food security and our rural communities."" The government says our ability to do trade deals around the world is one of the big benefits of Brexit. They've been trumpeting all sorts of deals over the last year but those deals are basically roll-overs of what we had before as members of the EU. The deal with Australia would be the first big deal to expand markets, so it is politically and symbolically important but at what price? Australia wants tax-free access to our markets for their big industrial farms so they can export lamb and sheep more cheaply. But famers here are saying we wouldn't be able to survive that competition unless we are protected by tariffs. They say a free trade deal would only add a tiny bit to the size of the British economy so is it really worth threatening famers for that. They also say there is also a precedent being set. Australia may be a relatively small market - but if they get a complete tariff-free access then what will the Americans or Brazilians want to have? The UK is Australia's seventh largest trading partner while Australia is the UK's 20th largest trading partner The UK's largest goods export to Australia is cars and trucks (Â£757m) Australia's largest exported good to the UK is lead (Â£267m) The government says a free trade agreement with Australia could increase UK exports to the Australia by up to Â£900m It also estimates a deal would increase workers' wages by 0.02% - 0.07%.

"The price of Bitcoin fell below $34,000 (Â£24,030) for the first time in three months on Wednesday, after China imposed fresh curbs on crypto-currencies. Beijing banned banks and payment firms from providing services related to crypto-currency transactions. It also warned investors against speculative crypto trading on Tuesday. It follows falls in Bitcoin of more than 10% last week after Tesla said it would no longer accept the currency. On Wednesday afternoon, Bitcoin recovered some ground, although it was still down -10.4% at $38,131. Meanwhile, other digital currencies such as Ether, which acts as the fuel for the Ethereum blockchain network, and Dogecoin lost as much as 22% and 24% respectively. Another big US bank to start trading in Bitcoin Tesla will no longer accept Bitcoin, says Elon Musk Elon Musk scammers make millions in crypto-fraud At the same time, Tesla shares fell more than 3% on Wall Street, possibly because of the electric carmaker's exposure to Bitcoin. The firm, owned by Elon Musk, still holds around $1.5bn worth of the crypto-currency. Crypto-currency trading has been illegal in China since 2019 in order to curb money-laundering. But people are still able to trade in currencies such as Bitcoin online, which has concerned Beijing. Elon Musk said crypto-currency could ""not come at great cost to the environment"" On Tuesday, three state-backed organisations, including the National Internet Finance Association of China, the China Banking Association and the Payment and Clearing Association of China issued a warning on social media. They said consumers would have no protection if they were to incur any losses from crypto-currency investment transactions. They added that recent wild swings in crypto-currency prices ""seriously violate people's asset safety"" and are disrupting the ""normal economic and financial order"". Neil Wilson of Markets.com said: ""China has for some time been putting pressure on the crypto space, but this marks an intensification - other countries might follow now as central banks make strides towards their own digital currencies. ""Until now, Western regulators have been pretty relaxed about Bitcoin, but this might change soon."" In March, Tesla boss Elon Musk announced unexpectedly that the electric carmaker would allow customers to buy cars using Bitcoin. But last week, he did a U-turn and suspended vehicle purchases using Bitcoin because of environmental concerns. His fears centre on Bitcoin mining - the energy-intensive process through which the digital currency is generated, using high-powered computers. It often relies on electricity generated with fossil fuels, particularly coal. ""We are concerned about rapidly increasing use of fossil fuels for Bitcoin mining and transactions, especially coal, which has the worst emissions of any fuel,"" Mr Musk wrote. ""Cryptocurrency is a good idea... but this cannot come at great cost to the environment."" He said the electric carmaker did not intend to sell any of its Bitcoin and intended to reinstate crypto-currency transactions once mining shifted to using more sustainable energy sources. Although the digital currency cannot be traded in China, more than 75% of Bitcoin mining around the world is done in China. For anyone who has followed the crypto-currency scene for a while, the events of recent weeks are a familiar story. Some random event - say, a tweet from Elon Musk announcing Tesla will accept crypto-currency payments - sends Bitcoin to new highs, and people begin to say it's winning mainstream acceptance. Then another random event happens, perhaps a change of course from the Tesla tycoon. It comes tumbling down again, and talk of it going mainstream fades into the background. Last month, in a chatroom on Clubhouse (another phenomenon that seems to be swinging from boom to bust) I expressed some scepticism about crypto-currencies. Up popped a senior figure from London's thriving fintech scene: ""Rory, Rory,"" he chided me, ""crypto is becoming an accepted asset class."" With big City institutions taking an interest, that had a ring of truth - back in April, at least. But this week, the weather had changed, with theFinancial Times,externalreporting ""new doubts among institutional fund managers over the future of crypto-currencies as an asset class"". My mind went back to 2013, when I had first taken an interest in Bitcoin. In a report for Radio 4's PM programme, I had bought a pizza for 0.5 BTC, a tortuous process which had not seemed worth the Â£30 it cost back then - of course, at today's exchange rate, that was a Â£14,000 pizza. I had also writtena blog post headlined ""The Bitcoin Bubble"", in which I tried to mine some lessons from a period when the price of the cryptocurrency shot up from $15 to $276 and then hurtled lower again. I ended a piece  in which I compared the cryptocurrency with 17th-Century Dutch tulips or London houses in the 1980s with this thought: ""Unless and until Bitcoin can be used to buy a sandwich, or be accepted by your friends when you pay them back for a restaurant meal, then it is likely to remain just a playground for geeks and gamblers."" Eight years on, it is still virtually impossible to buy a sandwich with Bitcoin. And why would you want to, when there's a good chance you'll be mocked a few years later - as I've been for my transaction - for giving away an asset that goes on to soar in value?

"Average UK house prices soared by 10.2% in the year to March, the highest annual growth rate for 14 years, according to official figures. The Office for National Statistics said average prices rose by Â£24,000 to Â£256,000 - a new record high. Prices have been pushed up by the temporary stamp duty reduction, low interest rates, as well as people wanting more space after lockdown. Hargreaves Lansdown analyst Sarah Coles warned the market risked overheating. ""We're back to the kind of double-figure house price rises we saw in the heady days before the financial crisis [of 2008],"" the analyst said. ""And while lenders are far more cautious than they were back in 2007, in this kind of market, there's still the risk buyers will lose their heads, and make a property mistake that could haunt them for years."" Anna Clare Harper, chief executive of asset manager SPI Capital, said the sharp rise in prices would mean fewer people were able to afford new homes. ""The effects are clear: with wages rising significantly more slowly than house prices, affordability constraints are increasing,"" she said. ""This is creating huge inequalities between older and younger generations, and growing demand from both younger and older renters who are priced out. ""For first-time buyers, this is a hideous market,"" she added. ""With average prices up Â£24,000 in a year, saving a 10% deposit needs Â£2,400 extra in savings."" Tax breaks introduced during the pandemic to boost the housing market had a marked effect over the period. The ONS report said: ""Changes in the tax paid on housing transactions may have allowed sellers to request higher prices as the buyers' overall costs are reduced."" A stamp duty holiday in England and Northern Ireland, which had been due to end in March, was recently extended. In Wales, a holiday on the equivalent tax has also been extended until the end of June 2021. A similar property transaction tax in Scotland ended on 31 March 2021. ""The extension of the stamp duty holiday helped ensure this won't be the last of the record months this year,"" said Sarah Coles. 'Fear of missing out' fuels record house prices UK housing market 'on the boil' as prices rise Average house prices increased over the year in England to Â£275,000, a 10.2% annual increase. In Wales prices climbed 11% to Â£185,000, in Scotland 10.6% to Â£167,000 and in Northern Ireland they were up 6% to Â£149,000. In England, Yorkshire and the Humber had the highest annual house price growth, up 14% in the year to March. The lowest annual growth was in London, where average prices increased by 3.7% over the year. However, London's average house prices remained the most expensive of any region in the UK at an average of Â£500,000. The figures also suggested a switch in demand for different types of property. The average price of detached properties increased by 11.7% in the year to March 2021, while flats and maisonettes were up just 5.0% over the period. ""The demand for a new type of home, coupled with the government's mortgage guarantee scheme, will continue to support transaction levels in the months ahead, and potentially in the medium-term,"" said Andrew Montlake, managing director of independent mortgage broker Coreco. ""Everything has changed due to the pandemic and that change will play out over several years yet.""

"At least 63 children are said to have been killed in Gaza, and two have been killed in Israel Of the 219 people who have been killed in Gaza, at least 63 are children, according to its health ministry. Of the 10 people killed in Israel, two children are among the dead, the country's medical service says. Here are the stories of some of the children who have been killed. Nine-year-old Yara (left) and five-year-old Rula (right) were killed alongside several family members on Sunday When an Israeli strike hit al-Wihda street in central Gaza City early on Sunday, at least 13 members of the extended al-Kawalek family are believed to have been killed, buried in the rubble of their own home. Many of the victims were children, with one said to be as young as six months. ""We saw nothing but smoke,"" one of the surviving members of the family, Sanaa al-Kawalek, told Felesteen Online. ""I couldn't see my son next to me and I was hugging him, but I could see nothing."" The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) described the bombing as ""abnormal"" and said the civilian casualties were unintended. A spokesman said air strikes had caused a tunnel to collapse, bringing houses down with it. Among those killed were sisters Yara, 9, and Rula, 5. Both had been receiving treatment for trauma from the Norwegian Refugee Council (NRC). The al-Kawaleks were polite girls who always did their homework on time, one of their teachers, who did not want be named, told the BBC. A picture circulating online is said to show 10-year-old Aziz al-Kawalek, the only surviving member of his direct family, sitting by his mother's body. Allow Twitter content?

Ido Avigal, five, who was killed in a Hamas rocket attack The youngest victim on the Israeli side is thought to be Ido Avigal, a five-year-old boy killed last Wednesday in the southern town of Sderot. Ido was killed inside a fortified room in what the Israeli military described as an ""incredibly rare"" incident. His mother grabbed him and took him to the fortified room when incoming rocket sirens sounded on Wednesday evening in Sderot, the Times of Israel reports. Rocket shrapnel pierced the protective metal plating used to cover the window of the room he was in, also injuring his mother and seven-year-old sister. He died of his injuries several hours later. ""It was a piece of the rocket that came in at a very specific angle, at a very specific speed and at a very specific point,""IDF spokesman Hidai Zilberman said of the incident,external. ""We were at home and the kids were a little bored, so my wife Shani went with them to her sister's house two buildings over,"" Ido's father, Asaf Avigal, told Channel 13. ""I'm sorry I did not take the shrapnel in your place,""Mr Avigal said at his son's funeral,external. ""A few days ago, you asked me: 'Dad, what will happen if the siren goes off while we are outdoors?' I told you that so long as you were with me you would be protected. I lied."" A few months ago,Mr Avigal and his wife had spoken,externalabout what an especially bright child Ido was, as if he was a 50-year-old in the body of a five-year-old.  He would often urge his father to leave the computer and spend more time with him. ""Enough with the screens - be with me,"" he would say. Ido's mother remains in hospital. Allow Twitter content?

Nadine Awad, a 16-year-old Arab-Israeli schoolgirl, was with her 52-year-old father in the early hours of last Wednesday, when a rocket struck their car and home, killing them both. Her mother, who was also in the car, was seriously injured, medics said. Nadine's cousin, Ahmad Ismail, says he heard the sound of a rocket hitting from inside the family home, in the city of Lod, close to Tel Aviv, where Arab and Jewish Israelis live together. ""It happened so quickly,"" he told the public broadcaster Kan. ""Even if we had wanted to run somewhere, we don't have a safe room."" Nadine was a ""very special girl"" in her first year of high school, who dreamed of becoming a doctor, those who knew her said. Her school principal said she ""had dreams of changing the world"". ""She was such a special girl, such a talented girl. She wanted to conquer the world,"" Shirin Natur Hafi told local radio,the Times of Israel reports,external.

""The kids put on their Eid clothes, took their toys and headed off to their uncle's house to celebrate,"" their 37-year-old father told reporters. ""They called in the evening to beg to stay the night and I said OK."" The next day, the building where they had been staying was hit. Only their five-month-old baby brother, Omar, survived, after being dragged from the rubble where he lay next to his dead mother. ""They were safe in their homes, they did not carry weapons, they did not fire rockets,"" Mr Hadidi said of his children. ""What did they do to deserve this? We're civilians."" Amid the wreckage,externalwere children's toys, a Monopoly board game and, sitting on the kitchen counter, unfinished plates of food from the holiday gathering. ""When my children went to sleep, they were hoping that when they woke up it would all be over. But they are gone now. I have only their memory, and the scent of them in my home,"" Mr Hadiditold The Times,externalnewspaper in London. Allow Facebook content? This article contains content provided by Facebook.

Ibrahim al-Masry was playing with his siblings in the front yard of their home in a northern neighbourhood of Gaza last week, when a strike hit, according to reports. Ibrahim and his brother Marwan, and several other relatives, were instantly killed. ""Every day in Ramadan they play in the street at this time before Iftar,"" their father, Youssef al-Masri,told The Independent,external.

"This video can not be played Malawi has incinerated thousands of expired coronavirus vaccine doses Health authorities in Malawi have incinerated 19,610 expired doses of the AstraZeneca coronavirus vaccine, saying it will reassure the public that any vaccines they do get are safe. It is the first African country to publicly do this. The World Health Organization initially urged countries not to destroy expired doses but has now changed its advice. Uptake of the vaccine in Malawi has been low and health workers hope the move will increase public confidence. Out of a population of about 18 million people, the country has recorded 34,232 confirmed coronavirus cases and 1,153 deaths. Africa Live: Latest updates on this and other stories Why are vaccines going to waste in Africa? DR Congo in race against time to vaccinate people Malawi received 102,000 doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine it acquired from the African Union on 26 March and used almost 80% of them. But the expiry date on the labels was 13 April and officials say this wasn't enough time to use them all. So in a 30-minute process, officials destroyed thousands of Covid-19 vaccines, leaving behind just broken pieces of the vials holding the liquid. Malawi's Health Minister Khumbize Chiponda (l) helped put the vaccines into a hospital incineration chamber Malawi's principal health secretary told the BBC that it was unfortunate they had to destroy the vaccines but the benefits outweighed the risks. ""When news spread that we had out-of-date vaccines, we noticed that people were not coming to our clinics to get immunised,"" said Dr Charles Mwansambo. ""If we don't burn them, people will think that we are using expired vaccines in our facilities and if they don't come, Covid-19 will hit them hard."" The government says it has adequate stocks of vaccines and has urged everyone over 18 years old to get a jab. In addition to the 102,000 from the African Union, it has received 300,000 doses under the Covax vaccine-sharing facility and 50,000 sourced direct from India. However, future supplies could be threatened by India's decision to halt exports. The vaccines had been taken out of cold storage some time ago On the streets of the capital Lilongwe, some people are worried about the safety of the vaccine. ""I would like to get vaccinated but how sure am I if I go to the hospital I won't be given the expired vaccines?"" shopkeeper Jack Chitete told the BBC. ""I have heard a lot of stories about people getting blood clots and some even dying after getting immunised. Are those people telling lies? If it is the truth, why are we being given the same vaccines?"" asked another shopkeeper, Mphatso Chipenda. The link between the AstraZeneca vaccine and rare blood clots is not yet proven, and health experts say the risk from Covid-19 is far higher. They advise people to get vaccinated if they can. Rare blood clots - what you need to know Malawi is not the only country in Africa to have expired vaccines. The WHO initially asked affected countries to hold onto the vaccines until it could establish whether they could still be used. But it now says vaccines already sent out by the manufacturer with a set expiry date should be destroyed. ""While discarding vaccines is deeply regrettable in the context of any immunisation programme, WHO recommends that these expired doses should be removed from the distribution chain and safely disposed of,""it said in a statement,externalon 17 May. Other vaccines that are currently in use have a shelf life of up to 36 months. The challenge with Covid-19 vaccines is that they have been in use for less than a year and there is no substantive data around their effectiveness after long periods.

"Damage from an Israeli air strike overnight in Gaza City US President Joe Biden has told Israel's PM Benjamin Netanyahu he expects a ""significant de-escalation"" in the Gaza conflict on Wednesday. Mr Biden wanted a ""path to ceasefire"", the White House said. The US is a staunch ally of Israel and has so far opposed a joint UN Security Council statement on the conflict. In response Mr Netanyahu said he was ""determined to carry on"" until ""calm and security are restored to Israeli citizens"", according to Israeli media. The conflict is in its 10th day, with a continuing exchange of rocket fire from Palestinian militants into Israel and Israeli air strikes on Gaza. On Wednesday, four rockets were also fired from Lebanon into Israel and Israel's military responded by firing artillery shells at ""a number of targets in Lebanese territory"". It was not immediately clear whether this would prove to be a significant escalation. The Israel-Palestinian conflict explained The children who have died in the conflict The Gaza fighting began after weeks of rising Israeli-Palestinian tension in occupied East Jerusalem that culminated in clashes at a holy site revered by both Muslims and Jews. Hamas, which controls Gaza, began firing rockets after warning Israel to withdraw from the site, triggering retaliatory air strikes. At least 227 people, including more than 100 women and children, have been killed in Gaza so far, according to its health ministry. Israel has said at least 150 militants are among those killed in Gaza. Hamas does not give casualty figures for fighters. In Israel 12 people, including two children, have been killed, its medical service says. Israel says some 4,000 rockets have been fired towards its territory by militants in Gaza. On Wednesday morning, Mr Biden held his fourth call with Mr Netanyahu since the conflict started. A statement released by the White House,externalsaid: ""The president conveyed to the prime minister that he expected a significant de-escalation today on the path to a ceasefire."" This video can not be played Ex-UN rapporteur John Dugard: US is not honest broker in Israel-Gaza conflict The US has called before for a truce but has held up any joint UN statement, saying it would not help with de-escalation. The Palestinian representative at the UN, Riyad Mansour, called the Security Council's failure to express a unified position ""shameful"". The latest bid for a council resolution calling for a ceasefire, launched by France, failed on Wednesday when the US said it could ""undermine efforts to de-escalate"". A major foreign policy headache for Biden What the law says about the fighting One Israeli military source told Reuters that Israel was assessing whether conditions were right for a truce. The Ynet news website said that the Israelis were talking with Egyptian mediators. It quoted sources in the Israeli cabinet as saying Israel could achieve its objectives and end the fighting ""within days"". A Hamas leader said that efforts by mediators were ""serious and continuous"" but that Palestinian demands had to be met. Earlier on Wednesday Mr Netanyahu did not appear ready to begin a truce. He said there were ""only two ways that you can deal with"" Hamas. ""You can either conquer them, and that's always an open possibility, or you can deter them, and we are engaged right now in forceful deterrence, but I have to say we don't rule out anything."" The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said there had been renewed rocket fire from Gaza on Wednesday and that its fighter jets had attacked military infrastructure, including tunnels, and the homes of Hamas commanders. The BBC's Rushdi Abualouf in Gaza said two Palestinian militants were killed in Gaza City, as dozens of strikes targeted both it and the southern city of Khan Younis. Israel's Iron Dome anti-missile system intercepted Palestinian rockets throughout the night Gaza City mother of seven Randa Abu Sultan, 45, told AFP news agency: ""My four-year-old son tells me he's scared that if he falls asleep, he'll wake up to find us dead."" IDF spokesman Brig Gen Hidai Zilberman said Israel had tried to assassinate Mohammed Deif, the head of Hamas's military wing, the Izzedine al-Qassam Brigades. Mohammed Deif has survived repeated attempts on his life,including in the last major conflict in 2014. He tends to stay in the background and his whereabouts remain unknown. Sirens sounded across much of south and central Israel on Wednesday. Hamas also targeted an Israeli air base overnight but the IDF said no bases were hit. Israel defends Gaza strategy as death toll mounts Why is Gaza blurry on Google Maps? Of the 3,750 rockets fired from the Gaza Strip since the fighting began, 550 have fallen short in Gaza, according to the IDF. Israel's Iron Dome missile defence system has intercepted about 90% of the rockets that have crossed into Israeli territory, it says. The IDF estimated that at the start of the conflict, Hamas and Islamic Jihad, the two main groups in Gaza, had an arsenal of about 12,000 rockets or mortars. Mr Netanyahu said the Israeli operation had ""set Hamas back by many years"". There has also been unrest within Israel and in the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem, where Palestinians took part in a general strike on Tuesday. There were clashes in several locations. The party of Turkish President Erdogan rejected US accusations of anti-Semitism Separately on Wednesday, Turkey rejected US accusations that President Recep Tayyip Erdogan had made anti-Semitic remarks about Israel. He had accused Israel of ""terrorism"" against the Palestinians and recently said: ""It is in their nature"". State department spokesman Ned Price said the US found the remarks ""reprehensible"". Omer Celik, a spokesman for Mr Erdogan's party, said the president had given very strong messages against anti-Semitism, adding: ""Accusing our president of anti-Semitism is an illogical and untrue approach. This is a lie."" The worst violence in years between Israel and the Palestinian territory of the Gaza Strip has seen dozens killed. It follows a month of spiralling tensions before open conflict broke out. Here is what happened in the lead-up to the fighting. 13 April Clashes erupt in East Jerusalem between Palestinians and Israeli police. Palestinians are angry over barriers which had been placed outside the Damascus Gate entrance to the Jerusalem‘s Old City preventing them from gathering there after prayers at the Old City’s al-Aqsa Mosque on what is the first night of the Islamic holy month of Ramadan. Palestinian discontent had been stoked earlier in the day when President Mahmoud Abbas called off planned elections, implicitly blaming Israel over voting arrangements for Palestinians in East Jerusalem. Hamas - Mr Abbas' Islamist rivals who control Gaza and were running in the elections - react angrily to the postponement. Violence around Damascus Gate and elsewhere in East Jerusalem continues nightly. 15-16 April Rockets are fired from Gaza at Israel, which responds with air strikes after a relative period of calm between Israel and the Palestinian enclave. 19 April Clashes spread to the mixed Arab-Jewish port city of Jaffa, next to Tel Aviv. 20 April In Jerusalem, Jewish youths, angry over a spate of filmed assaults by Palestinians on Orthodox Jews posted on the TikTok video-sharing app, attack Arabs and chant anti-Arab slogans. 23 April Hundreds of ultra-nationalist Jews shouting “Death to Arabs” march towards Damascus Gate in protest at the Arab assaults on Jews. Clashes erupt at the site between Palestinians and police trying to separate the two groups, injuring dozens of people. Violence between Arabs and Jews spreads to other parts of the city. 24 April Militants fire dozens of rockets at Israel from Gaza, drawing retaliatory air strikes. 2 May President Abbas' Fatah faction and Hamas condemn the looming threatened eviction of Palestinian families from their homes in the Sheikh Jarrah district of East Jerusalem by Jewish settlers ahead of a planned court hearing. Hamas calls on Arabs to form “human shields of resistance” there. In the days that follow, police and protesters repeatedly clash at the site as it becomes a focal point for Palestinian anger. 4 May Militants in Gaza begin sending incendiary balloons into Israel over successive days, causing dozens of fires. 7 May Two Palestinian gunmen are shot dead and a third is wounded after opening fire on Israeli security forces in the northern West Bank. Israeli authorities say the group planned to carry out a “major attack” in Israel. Later on after Friday prayers - the last of Ramadan - major clashes erupt at the al-Aqsa mosque compound, injuring more than 200 people. Israel's police force says it used “riot dispersal means”, firing rubber bullets and stun grenades after officers came under a hail of stones and bottles. 8 May A second night of violence erupts in East Jerusalem after tens of thousands of worshippers prayed at the al-Aqsa mosque for Laylat al-Qadr, the holiest night of Ramadan. Police and protesters clash at Damascus Gate, with police using water cannon, rubber bullets and tear gas against crowds of Palestinians, some throwing stones. More than 120 Palestinians and some 17 police are injured. 9 May Israel's Supreme Court postpones the hearing on the Sheikh Jarrah case following calls to delay it because of the growing unrest. Tensions remain high though and more clashes take place between Israeli police and Palestinians in Sheikh Jarrah and at Damascus Gate. 10 May Early morning clashes break out between police and Palestinians at the al-Aqsa mosque compound, where crowds throw stones and officers fire stun grenades. Palestinian anger has been inflamed by an annual Jerusalem Day march planned for later in the day by hundreds of Israeli nationalists to celebrate Israel's capture of East Jerusalem in 1967. The march is due to pass through predominantly Arab parts of the Old City in what is seen by Palestinians as a deliberate provocation. It is rerouted at the 11th hour, but the atmosphere remains volatile with more than 300 Palestinians and some 21 police injured in the violence at the holy site. Hamas issues an ultimatum to Israel to “withdraw its soldiers... from the blessed al-Aqsa mosque and Sheikh Jarrah” by 18:00. When the deadline passes without an Israeli response, rockets are fired towards Jerusalem for the first time in years. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says the group has “crossed a red line” and Israel retaliates with air strikes, killing three Hamas fighters. A continuing exchange of rocket-fire and air strikes quickly escalates into the fiercest hostilities between the two sides since they fought a war in 2014.

"At least 63 children are said to have been killed in Gaza, and two have been killed in Israel Of the 219 people who have been killed in Gaza, at least 63 are children, according to its health ministry.

Ido Avigal, five, who was killed in a Hamas rocket attack The youngest victim on the Israeli side is thought to be Ido Avigal, a five-year-old boy killed last Wednesday in the southern town of Sderot. Ido was killed inside a fortified room in what the Israeli military described as an ""incredibly rare"" incident. His mother grabbed him and took him to the fortified room when incoming rocket sirens sounded on Wednesday evening in Sderot, the Times of Israel reports.

Nadine Awad, a 16-year-old Arab-Israeli schoolgirl, was with her 52-year-old father in the early hours of last Wednesday, when a rocket struck their car and home, killing them both. Her mother, who was also in the car, was seriously injured, medics said. Nadine's cousin, Ahmad Ismail, says he heard the sound of a rocket hitting from inside the family home, in the city of Lod, close to Tel Aviv, where Arab and Jewish Israelis live together. ""It happened so quickly,"" he told the public broadcaster Kan. ""Even if we had wanted to run somewhere, we don't have a safe room."" Nadine was a ""very special girl"" in her first year of high school, who dreamed of becoming a doctor, those who knew her said. Her school principal said she ""had dreams of changing the world"". ""She was such a special girl, such a talented girl. She wanted to conquer the world,"" Shirin Natur Hafi told local radio,the Times of Israel reports,external. Nadine had been involved in a number of science-related and social projects with Jewish schools in the area, and she had planned to participate in a biomedical studies programme, Ms Hafi said. Baby Omar was the only one of his family to survive in the strike that killed his mother and siblings On Friday, Muhammad al-Hadidi's four children - Suhayb, 13, Yahya, 11, Abderrahman, eight, and Osama, six - put on their finest clothes and went to visit their cousins nearby, in the Shati refugee camp outside Gaza City, to celebrate Eid, which marks the end of Ramadan. ""The kids put on their Eid clothes, took their toys and headed off to their uncle's house to celebrate,"" their 37-year-old father told reporters.

"Clothes prices rose again in April The annual UK inflation rate more than doubled in April, as a rise in energy and clothing costs drove prices higher. The jump to 1.5% in April from 0.7% in March, means consumer prices are rising at their fastest rate since March 2020 at the outset of the pandemic. The sharp increase largely reflected a jump in prices from low levels a year ago at the start of the pandemic, the Office for National Statistics said. Higher oil prices also pushed up petrol prices, it added. UK job vacancies highest for a year as lockdown eases Covid-19: Thousands head overseas on holiday as rules ease According to the ONS, inflation climbed as lockdown restrictions were eased and shops reopened on 12 April. The rise in clothing and footwear prices reversed an unusual fall in February. Meanwhile, gas and electricity prices rose sharply after the default tariff cap was increased compared with a cut a year earlier. Hannah Audino, economist at PwC, said she expected inflation to continue to rise as lockdown restrictions eased and the economy continued to reopen ""allowing consumers to unleash some of their excess savings"". ""Recent survey evidence suggests that the share of households who plan to spend some of their savings has increased in recent months, as the vaccine rollout boosts confidence,"" she added. April's inflation rise had been predicted by economists, but there are concerns that soaring inflation this year as the global economy recovers from the pandemic could push central banks to raise interest rates. Inflation is the rate at which the prices for goods and services increase. It's one of the key measures of financial well-being because it affects what consumers can buy for their money. If there is inflation, money doesn't go as far. It's expressed as a percentage increase or decrease in prices over time. For example, if the inflation rate for the cost of a litre of petrol is 2% a year, motorists need to spend 2% more at the pump than 12 months earlier. And if wages don't keep up with inflation, purchasing power and the standard of living falls. A little inflation, however, typically encourages people to buy products sooner and makes it easier for companies to put up wages. And both of those things boost economic growth. That's why most countries' central banks have an inflation target of between 2% and 2.5%. In the UK, the government has set the Bank of England an inflation target of 2%. Read more here. Earlier in May, fears about rising inflation in the UShit financial marketsafter consumer prices recorded their biggest annual jump since 2008. High government spending on Covid support programmes, coupled with a build-up in consumer savings, have driven prices higher, says experts. Liz Martins, senior economist at HSBC, said that it looked like UK inflation would go above the Bank of England's 2% target, although this was ""not too much of a worry for the Bank"". ""Their view is that they need to keep inflation sustainably around 2% two to three years out from now, so the short term overshoot won't worry them too much, if it does prove temporary - and that's where opinions really seem to diverge,"" she told the BBC. Many central bank governors, particularly in the US, are saying that the rise is due to bottlenecks in the aftermath of the pandemic which will go away, Ms Martins said. But some people, including Bank of England chief economist Andy Haldane, say higher prices could stunt the recovery and that the Bank may need to raise interest rates to cool things down. Laith Khalaf, a financial analyst at AJ Bell, said that the rise in prices was ""in key areas where it's hard for consumers to control spending, namely transport, clothing, and household energy"". ""At current levels, inflation is nothing to fret about, but there is rising concern that the fiscal and monetary response to the pandemic has sown the seeds of an inflationary scare further down the road,"" he said. He said the Bank of England has made it clear it will tolerate inflation above its 2% target without ""pulling the trigger"" on interest rate rises. ""However, if inflation looks like it's going to get a significant foothold, markets will take matters into their own hands and raise borrowing costs across the economy,"" he said. Two weeks ago the Bank of England said that UK inflation is heading above its 2% target and is expected to hit 2.5% at the end of 2021. That is due to a rise in global oil prices and the expiry in September of Covid emergency cuts to value added tax (VAT) in the hospitality sector, as well as comparisons with the pandemic slump of 2020. The Bank thinks inflation will then slip back to 2% in 2022 and 2023. Bank of England governor Andrew Bailey said on Tuesday that so far there was no strong evidence that higher prices paid by manufacturers were feeding through to consumer prices. However, he said the Bank ""will be watching this extremely carefully"" and would take action if necessary. Lockdowns are deflationary; because they forcibly stop us shopping, travelling and mixing they reduce demand for everything from consumer goods and energy. So a return to more normal levels of inflation was always likely as the global economy slowly started to re-open. Clothes prices, for example, contributed to the rising cost of living not because they were rising by much but because they were no longer falling. What's spooked markets recently is the risk of inflation coming down the pipeline. In a literal sense it already is: the price of oil has been rising in anticipation of a global recovery, pushing up petrol and household bills. Last week, markets took a knock fearing that the rising cost of raw materials would force the Bank of England to raise interest rates from their rock bottom official level of 0.1% sooner than anticipated to stop inflation getting out of control. The Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey has twice spoken publicly to play down that anxiety, saying on Tuesday that he had not yet seen strong evidence of those rising costs being passed through to consumers. But Wednesday's figures for what manufacturers are paying for raw materials show a rise in input prices - what manufacturers pay for raw materials - of 9.9%. That's the fastest rise in four years and faster than most economists expected. Higher petrol prices drive up cost of living Cheaper clothes and cars push inflation lower Why are prices rising in the UK?

"Former US President Donald Trump has lashed out after the New York attorney general said her inquiry into the Trump Organisation was now a criminal probe. Letitia James, the state's top prosecutor, has been scrutinising the ex-Republican president's financial dealings before he took office. A spokesperson for Ms James said the inquiry into Mr Trump's property company was ""no longer purely civil"". Mr Trump on Wednesday said she was ""in desperate search of a crime"". Ms James' spokesman, Fabien Levy, told the BBC on Tuesday: ""We have informed the Trump Organization that our investigation into the Organization is no longer purely civil in nature. ""We are now actively investigating the Trump Organization in a criminal capacity, along with the Manhattan DA. We have no additional comment."" The offices of the state attorney general and city district attorney are separate and, according to National Public Radio (NPR), have historically been rivals. The fact that they are now co-ordinating their efforts underscores the high profile of their investigation. The two prosecutors are combing through millions of pages of financial information in a search for evidence, reports NPR. The statement did not say what turned the inquiry from civil to criminal in nature, or whether the former president himself might be personally implicated in any allegations. Mr Trump accused Ms James and District Attorney Cyrus Vance, both Democrats, of being ""possessed"" by their political vendettas against him. A statement from his office rebuked the investigation as ""a continuation of the greatest political Witch Hunt in the history of the United States"". ""After prosecutorial efforts the likes of which nobody has ever seen before, they failed to stop me in Washington, so they turned it over to New York to do their dirty work. This is what I have been going through for years,"" he wrote. The former president's eldest son, Donald Trump Jr, condemned the inquiry as ""flagrant abuse of political office"". On Twitter, he shared an old video of Ms James promising to pursue all legal options against Mr Trump while she was still campaigning for the attorney general role. The video drew fiery comments from other top Trump allies, like senior advisor Stephen Miller, who said the US system of law was being turned into ""a weapon of vengeance not an instrument of justice"". Civil cases usually have to do with injury to individuals or other private parties, including businesses; criminal law applies in cases where the damage is thought to affect society at large, including the state. Six legal battles looming for Trump Ms James launched a civil inquiry in March 2019 into claims that Mr Trump had inflated the value of his assets to banks when seeking loans, and understated them to lower his taxes. Her office has also been seeking documents on four Trump Organization properties in Manhattan, upstate New York, Chicago and Los Angeles. Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr said in court documents last August that his office was investigating alleged ""protracted criminal conduct"" at the Trump Organization. Mr Vance's legal filing cited newspaper articles about purported bank and insurance fraud at the company. The Manhattan district attorney has also been investigating whether any of Mr Trump's financial records were doctored to cover up hush-money payments to two women in 2016 who say they had affairs with him. Mr Vance's office said in February it had obtained Mr Trump's tax returns as part of the investigation, after a long legal battle. Throughout his presidency, Mr Trump resolutely refused to reveal his tax returns, despite coming under great pressure to do so. Allen Weisselberg, the chief financial officer of the Trump Organization, and members of his family have been the focus of the investigators. The clock is ticking. Mr Vance leaves office in December, and he would be expected file any criminal complaint by the end of the year. Will Grant, BBC News, Washington DC Throughout his time in office, Donald Trump dismissed any probe into his financial dealings or those of his organisation as a politically-motivated ""witch hunt"" led by Democrats desperate to see him forced from power. Yet now that he no longer enjoys protection from prosecution, this latest development will trouble him. That a former US president is facing not one but two criminal investigations is a significant development, one which could have repercussions for his political future. The New York State Attorney General, Letitia James, clearly believes that there is enough at play to warrant moving the investigation from a civil to a criminal one. When combined with the ongoing examination of the former president's tax returns by the Manhattan District Attorney, Cy Vance, Mr Trump is looking at a complex and tangled legal battle ahead â one which he remains adamant he shouldn't have to face but which he now almost certainly cannot avoid.

"A new report has found that too often ""special measures"" - designed to help witnesses give evidence and relieve stress - were not being offered to victims. Photo posed by a model. Rape victims in England and Wales should be able to pre-record evidence and cross-examinations so that they do not have to face perpetrators in court, the victims' commissioner has said. In a new report, Dame Vera Baird has called for the practice to be rolled out ""as soon as practically possible"". It would also reduce stressful waits in the run-up to trials, she told the BBC. The BBC understands the government is considering the move, but it is not clear how it would be implemented. A plan will be laid out in a government review due to be published next month. Ina review of the provision,externalfor vulnerable and intimidated witnesses in courts, Dame Vera said pre-recording interviews would relieve unnecessary stress for those who had experienced sexual assault. ""We've found that almost everybody who was asked had heard victims say how frightened they were to come to court,"" she said. They did not want to come face-to-face with the defendant or their ""supporters"", she said, nor did they want people in the public gallery. She also said the practice would reduce the wait between the witness giving initial evidence to police and being cross-examined in court, which can sometimes be two years because of backlogs made worse by the pandemic. Instead, the evidence and cross-examination could both be filmed soon after the alleged offence, and played to a jury in court once the case reached trial, without any further involvement from the victim. Dame Vera said this would mean the complainant could give their account ""whilst their memory is good"" then move on - and, if they choose, get therapy without fear that their notes could then be used by the defence. She said asking people alleging rape to wait for years before being cross-examined ""preserves the traumatisation"" and can lead to them withdrawing from prosecution altogether. Around43% of rape complainants dropped out of prosecutions,externalin the nine months to December 2020, according to Home Office figures. Those who do proceed can give up if their case is listed for a certain date but cancelled last minute, Dame Vera said, adding: ""It's a torture you don't have to put anyone through."" The law in England and Wales says that under ""special measures"", witnesses who are classed as vulnerable or intimidated are eligible to pre-record their initial evidence and cross-examination. This practice was rolled outfor all vulnerable witnesses - which includes all children - last year.However, it is not currently used for intimidated witnesses, which includes those who allege sexual offences. A pilot was introduced in three courts September 2019 and an evaluation has not yet been published. Dame Vera Baird's report was based on interviews with people working in the criminal justice sector and victim support services. The victims' commissioner's report found that the guilty plea rate was ""notably higher"" when evidence was pre-recorded and the process was less traumatic for witnesses. It also said, more broadly, that too often ""special measures"" - designed to help witnesses give evidence and relieve stress - were not being offered to those who were entitled to them. These measures include the provision of screens to shield witnesses from the defendant in court, and the option to appear in court from a separate room via television link. Among its recommendations is a call for the government to make sure that separate entrances and waiting rooms are available for vulnerable and intimidated witnesses, and to make greater use of remote centres where witnesses can give evidence without attending court. The BBC understands that a government review to be published next month will also include plans to ask judges to bar the public from courts more often and to ensure mobile phones are returned to victims within 24 hours. Katie Russell, spokeswoman for Rape Crisis England and Wales,  told the BBC that these measures, as well as pre-recording evidence, would have the ""potential to improve the unacceptably low levels of criminal justice"" that rape and sexual violence complainants receive. ""All sexual violence and abuse victims and survivors have been subjected to trauma and deserve trauma-informed and sensitive treatment,"" she said. She also said the ""significant length of time"" that mobile phones were kept for had been ""a cause for concern for some time"". ""Being disconnected from friends, family and support networks at such a difficult and stressful time can undoubtedly be distressing,"" she said. In a statement, the Ministry of Justice said: ""We understand how traumatic the court process can be and despite the pandemic we are continuing to improve the support provided for victims."" ""This includes protective screens and video links in every criminal court, more separate waiting rooms as well as piloting the pre-recording of cross-examination for rape victims to help further reduce the stress of attending court,"" it added. ""At the same time, a new Victims' Bill - set out in the Queen's Speech - will strengthen the rights of victims at every stage of the justice system.""

"Lee and Louise know they'll be taking their two children on holiday this summer. What they don't know is where they'll go. It might be Norfolk or it might be their preference - Fuerteventura. They booked both in case Covid restrictions prevented them from going to the Canary Islands. And because they're not the only ones doing this, some UK resorts fear they could be facing a rush of cancellations. Low and no-deposit bookings have been offered by lots of companies this summer to allow extra flexibility because of the Covid pandemic. While that's led to record bookings for lots of UK resorts, plenty of customers have taken advantage by booking not one, but two holidays for the same time slot, knowing they'll not lose any money at all. I spoke to Lee and Louise under a gazebo in their garden, in the pouring rain, in Lancashire, so it's no surprise that they are holding onto a dream of basking in the sunshine. They've booked time off work and are determined to get away somewhere. When they splashed out on a holiday to the Canary islands they weren't sure if travel there would be allowed, so they booked a reserve option too. They're keeping both bookings and hedging their bets a little longer, in the hopes of guaranteed heat, while ensuring themselves a get-away somewhere. Although they love Cromer in Norfolk, there is no hesitation when I ask which holiday they'd rather go on. ""Fuerteventura, fingers-crossed"", says Louise. Lee and Louise have booked two getaways this summer so they don't miss out altogether She says: ""In this country it can be a bit more difficult to find things to do if the weather is not great."" Lee says the family all get so excited about the prospect of a holiday, that after a tough year, they are determined to make sure they have a great summer. ""You start planning, you start preparing, and if that's suddenly taken away it can actually impact our mental well-being,"" explains Lee. That's why they are keeping the Norfolk booking and will decide nearer the time. And it seems Lee, Louise and their children may not be alone. The peak for holiday bookings came early on in the year, before the government issued its rules on travel. Plenty of people are still hoping for some amendments before the summer holiday season begins, so some industry insiders reckon they may have doubled-booked in order to keep their options open. Avvio provides the software behind 500 of the UK's top hotels. They say bookings are very high but cancellation rates at the moment are running at just 4%, far below the usual 30% levels. Chief commercial officer Michael De Jongh says this is because of double-bookings, although concrete evidence of the phenomenon won't kick in until later this summer, when consumers actually start cancelling UK trips in favour of European ones or vice versa. He says cancellations would cause problems for hotels, in the same way as multiple restaurant bookings did during the Chancellor Rishi Sunak's Eat Out To Help Out scheme. ""There's a growing trend to book rooms at multiple hotels, with a view to cancelling all but one at the last minute. This causes so many problems for hotels, in the same way as multiple restaurant bookings did during Eat Out To Help Out. ""If someone does have to cancel,"" he says, ""I'd urge them to always give the hotel as much notice as possible or better still modify the booking to an alternative date."" At Hipping Hall hotel, George Norrie says if people cancel early enough he should be able to fill the rooms Hipping Hall, like most venues, has kept its bookings policy as flexible as possible to allow people to book without fear of losing money. It's a small boutique hotel in Kirkby Lonsdale, part-way between the Lake District and the Yorkshire Dales. It's only been able to open its doors to guests again this week, and its 15 rooms are fully booked for months to come. General manager George Norrie says if people cancel with enough notice, the hotel should be able to fill the slot, because on some nights it even has a waiting list. He thinks the bigger challenge for them is giving first-time staycation holidaymakers a brilliant experience so that they come back again next year. ""When our guests get here we're going to do our best to make sure they get the best experience they possibly can. Next year they might go abroad, but they might come and see us for a two-day stay as well."" Lee and Louise say they'll make sure they give enough notice for either of their chosen destinations to fill the slot, and the flexible booking they were given means they won't lose any money. For them it's a win-win. While a late flurry of cancellations may cause headaches for UK hoteliers, there is good news for disorganised holidaymakers. There'll be plenty of last-minute bargains for UK holidays, whatever the weather.

Also, because they're newer, less is known about how they respond to current vaccines. The Delta variant - first identified in India - is the latest to cause concern. Others include those first identified in Brazil, South Africa and the UK (Kent). The variants were initially named after the place where they were first seen, butthe World Health Organization (WHO) has announced a new naming systemwhich uses Greek letters instead.

"Health officials have struggled to deliver vaccines across DR Congo Many thousands of vaccine doses have been destroyed in African countries because they've exceeded their expiry dates. Others are being returned by countries saying they will be unable to use them before they expire. The UN's children's fund, Unicef, is urging those countries intending to donate vaccinesto release them early enough so that they can be used in time. Malawi destroyed almost 20,000 doses of the AstraZeneca (AZ) vaccine, while South Sudan announced it would destroy 59,000 doses. Both countries had received these vaccines from the African Union, but had not been able to administer them by their expiry date of 13 April. ""While discarding vaccines is deeply regrettable in the context of any immunisation programme, WHO [World Heath Organization] recommends thatthese expired doses should be...safely disposed [of],,external"" The Democratic Republic of Congo, meanwhile, said it could not use most of the 1.7 million AZ doses it received under the global Covax scheme for poorer countries. These have an expiry date of 24 June and have been sent to other countries including Ghana and Madagascar. This video can not be played Covax vaccine plan: What is it and how will it work? South Sudan is also handing back 72,000 doses it got through the Covax scheme. It had received 132,000 doses of the AZ vaccine in March, with an expiry date of the end of June. Of these, South Sudan has been able to administer just 10,000, but has kept a further 50,000 to distribute before they expire. The AstraZeneca vaccine can be stored safely in refrigerated conditions for up to six months. But when given vaccines with a short shelf life before expiry, countries have struggled to administer them. South Africa had received one million doses from India in February with an expiry date of 13 April. But thethe government decided not to use them, concerned the vaccine offered insufficient protection from the variant prevalent in the country. New variants causing concern in Africa So in late March, these doses were passed on to other African countries through the African Union but with very little time left to use them. South Sudan was one of the recipients, but said they had not been made aware of the expiry date. Nigeria was another, but it also said it would be unable to use all its doses, so some of these were reassigned to neighbouring Togo and Ghana. The WHO says only Togo and The Gambia have confirmed they used all these doses by the expiry date. It's  similar story with the Covax scheme, with some countries unable to use their vaccines in time. Many countries failed to prepare adequately before receiving the vaccines, Phionah Atuhebwe, from the WHO in Africa, says. ""That is one of the reasons we are seeing the slow pace of rollout,"" she says. South Sudan says in addition to the problem of limited financial resources, the country has also struggled because of a reluctance by health care workers to get vaccinated. A health ministry official there has also pointed out that its parliament was slow in approving the vaccines, along with delays in training health workers for the task. ""The continent as a whole knows how to vaccinate and has been vaccinating for other diseases,"" says John Nkengasong, head of the Africa Centres for Disease Control (CDC), ""but the key is how do you scale that up - and... at speed?"" For DR Congo the problem is not only weak health services but also a very poor transport network - making the delivery of vaccines to remote areas a major issue. By air, boat and foot to deliver measles vaccines in DR Congo To complicate matters further, the country suspended its AstraZeneca vaccine rollout in mid-March, amid safety concerns, resuming on 19 April - more than a month later. Some experts and politicians blame concerns over the safety and efficacy of vaccines in general for the slow uptake in many countries in Africa - but it is hard to quantify that impact. ""It took a while to convince people,"" Sierra Leone Health Minister Austin Demby tells BBC News ""So it is not just vaccine hesitancy, it is like [having] vaccine sceptics to start with."" Ghana is one of the few countries in Africa to have fully utilised its vaccine supplies Malawi virologist Gama Bandawe says mistrust of vaccines has played a role in the country being unable to use all the supplies it has received. And South Africa's decision to stop using the AstraZeneca vaccine, amid concerns around cases of blood clots, may have added to these doubts. ""The government did the best they could - but perhaps the general public has not been as receptive as was expected,"" he says. Rare blood clots - what you need to know A study commissioned by the Africa CDC on Covid-19 vaccine perceptions in 15 countries indicateda significant proportion of people had concerns around vaccine safety,external. On average, about 20% of respondents said they would not have a vaccine - but the proportion varied from below 10% in Ethiopia, Niger and Tunisia to 41% in DR Congo.

"Damage from an Israeli air strike overnight in Gaza City US President Joe Biden has told Israel's PM Benjamin Netanyahu he expects a ""significant de-escalation"" in the Gaza conflict on Wednesday. Mr Biden wanted a ""path to ceasefire"", the White House said. The US is a staunch ally of Israel and has so far opposed a joint UN Security Council statement on the conflict. In response Mr Netanyahu said he was ""determined to carry on"" until ""calm and security are restored to Israeli citizens"", according to Israeli media. The conflict is in its 10th day, with a continuing exchange of rocket fire from Palestinian militants into Israel and Israeli air strikes on Gaza. On Wednesday, four rockets were also fired from Lebanon into Israel and Israel's military responded by firing artillery shells at ""a number of targets in Lebanese territory"". It was not immediately clear whether this would prove to be a significant escalation. The Israel-Palestinian conflict explained The children who have died in the conflict The Gaza fighting began after weeks of rising Israeli-Palestinian tension in occupied East Jerusalem that culminated in clashes at a holy site revered by both Muslims and Jews. Hamas, which controls Gaza, began firing rockets after warning Israel to withdraw from the site, triggering retaliatory air strikes. At least 227 people, including more than 100 women and children, have been killed in Gaza so far, according to its health ministry. Israel has said at least 150 militants are among those killed in Gaza. Hamas does not give casualty figures for fighters. In Israel 12 people, including two children, have been killed, its medical service says. Israel says some 4,000 rockets have been fired towards its territory by militants in Gaza. On Wednesday morning, Mr Biden held his fourth call with Mr Netanyahu since the conflict started. A statement released by the White House,externalsaid: ""The president conveyed to the prime minister that he expected a significant de-escalation today on the path to a ceasefire."" This video can not be played Ex-UN rapporteur John Dugard: US is not honest broker in Israel-Gaza conflict The US has called before for a truce but has held up any joint UN statement, saying it would not help with de-escalation. The Palestinian representative at the UN, Riyad Mansour, called the Security Council's failure to express a unified position ""shameful"". The latest bid for a council resolution calling for a ceasefire, launched by France, failed on Wednesday when the US said it could ""undermine efforts to de-escalate"". A major foreign policy headache for Biden What the law says about the fighting One Israeli military source told Reuters that Israel was assessing whether conditions were right for a truce. The Ynet news website said that the Israelis were talking with Egyptian mediators. It quoted sources in the Israeli cabinet as saying Israel could achieve its objectives and end the fighting ""within days"". A Hamas leader said that efforts by mediators were ""serious and continuous"" but that Palestinian demands had to be met. Earlier on Wednesday Mr Netanyahu did not appear ready to begin a truce. He said there were ""only two ways that you can deal with"" Hamas. ""You can either conquer them, and that's always an open possibility, or you can deter them, and we are engaged right now in forceful deterrence, but I have to say we don't rule out anything."" The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said there had been renewed rocket fire from Gaza on Wednesday and that its fighter jets had attacked military infrastructure, including tunnels, and the homes of Hamas commanders. The BBC's Rushdi Abualouf in Gaza said two Palestinian militants were killed in Gaza City, as dozens of strikes targeted both it and the southern city of Khan Younis. Israel's Iron Dome anti-missile system intercepted Palestinian rockets throughout the night Gaza City mother of seven Randa Abu Sultan, 45, told AFP news agency: ""My four-year-old son tells me he's scared that if he falls asleep, he'll wake up to find us dead."" IDF spokesman Brig Gen Hidai Zilberman said Israel had tried to assassinate Mohammed Deif, the head of Hamas's military wing, the Izzedine al-Qassam Brigades. Mohammed Deif has survived repeated attempts on his life,including in the last major conflict in 2014. He tends to stay in the background and his whereabouts remain unknown. Sirens sounded across much of south and central Israel on Wednesday. Hamas also targeted an Israeli air base overnight but the IDF said no bases were hit. Israel defends Gaza strategy as death toll mounts Why is Gaza blurry on Google Maps? Of the 3,750 rockets fired from the Gaza Strip since the fighting began, 550 have fallen short in Gaza, according to the IDF. Israel's Iron Dome missile defence system has intercepted about 90% of the rockets that have crossed into Israeli territory, it says. The IDF estimated that at the start of the conflict, Hamas and Islamic Jihad, the two main groups in Gaza, had an arsenal of about 12,000 rockets or mortars. Mr Netanyahu said the Israeli operation had ""set Hamas back by many years"". There has also been unrest within Israel and in the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem, where Palestinians took part in a general strike on Tuesday. There were clashes in several locations. The party of Turkish President Erdogan rejected US accusations of anti-Semitism Separately on Wednesday, Turkey rejected US accusations that President Recep Tayyip Erdogan had made anti-Semitic remarks about Israel. He had accused Israel of ""terrorism"" against the Palestinians and recently said: ""It is in their nature"". State department spokesman Ned Price said the US found the remarks ""reprehensible"". Omer Celik, a spokesman for Mr Erdogan's party, said the president had given very strong messages against anti-Semitism, adding: ""Accusing our president of anti-Semitism is an illogical and untrue approach. This is a lie."" The worst violence in years between Israel and the Palestinian territory of the Gaza Strip has seen dozens killed. It follows a month of spiralling tensions before open conflict broke out. Here is what happened in the lead-up to the fighting. 13 April Clashes erupt in East Jerusalem between Palestinians and Israeli police. Palestinians are angry over barriers which had been placed outside the Damascus Gate entrance to the Jerusalem‘s Old City preventing them from gathering there after prayers at the Old City’s al-Aqsa Mosque on what is the first night of the Islamic holy month of Ramadan. Palestinian discontent had been stoked earlier in the day when President Mahmoud Abbas called off planned elections, implicitly blaming Israel over voting arrangements for Palestinians in East Jerusalem. Hamas - Mr Abbas' Islamist rivals who control Gaza and were running in the elections - react angrily to the postponement. Violence around Damascus Gate and elsewhere in East Jerusalem continues nightly. 15-16 April Rockets are fired from Gaza at Israel, which responds with air strikes after a relative period of calm between Israel and the Palestinian enclave. 19 April Clashes spread to the mixed Arab-Jewish port city of Jaffa, next to Tel Aviv. 20 April In Jerusalem, Jewish youths, angry over a spate of filmed assaults by Palestinians on Orthodox Jews posted on the TikTok video-sharing app, attack Arabs and chant anti-Arab slogans. 23 April Hundreds of ultra-nationalist Jews shouting “Death to Arabs” march towards Damascus Gate in protest at the Arab assaults on Jews. Clashes erupt at the site between Palestinians and police trying to separate the two groups, injuring dozens of people. Violence between Arabs and Jews spreads to other parts of the city. 24 April Militants fire dozens of rockets at Israel from Gaza, drawing retaliatory air strikes. 2 May President Abbas' Fatah faction and Hamas condemn the looming threatened eviction of Palestinian families from their homes in the Sheikh Jarrah district of East Jerusalem by Jewish settlers ahead of a planned court hearing. Hamas calls on Arabs to form “human shields of resistance” there. In the days that follow, police and protesters repeatedly clash at the site as it becomes a focal point for Palestinian anger. 4 May Militants in Gaza begin sending incendiary balloons into Israel over successive days, causing dozens of fires. 7 May Two Palestinian gunmen are shot dead and a third is wounded after opening fire on Israeli security forces in the northern West Bank. Israeli authorities say the group planned to carry out a “major attack” in Israel. Later on after Friday prayers - the last of Ramadan - major clashes erupt at the al-Aqsa mosque compound, injuring more than 200 people. Israel's police force says it used “riot dispersal means”, firing rubber bullets and stun grenades after officers came under a hail of stones and bottles. 8 May A second night of violence erupts in East Jerusalem after tens of thousands of worshippers prayed at the al-Aqsa mosque for Laylat al-Qadr, the holiest night of Ramadan. Police and protesters clash at Damascus Gate, with police using water cannon, rubber bullets and tear gas against crowds of Palestinians, some throwing stones. More than 120 Palestinians and some 17 police are injured. 9 May Israel's Supreme Court postpones the hearing on the Sheikh Jarrah case following calls to delay it because of the growing unrest. Tensions remain high though and more clashes take place between Israeli police and Palestinians in Sheikh Jarrah and at Damascus Gate. 10 May Early morning clashes break out between police and Palestinians at the al-Aqsa mosque compound, where crowds throw stones and officers fire stun grenades. Palestinian anger has been inflamed by an annual Jerusalem Day march planned for later in the day by hundreds of Israeli nationalists to celebrate Israel's capture of East Jerusalem in 1967. The march is due to pass through predominantly Arab parts of the Old City in what is seen by Palestinians as a deliberate provocation. It is rerouted at the 11th hour, but the atmosphere remains volatile with more than 300 Palestinians and some 21 police injured in the violence at the holy site. Hamas issues an ultimatum to Israel to “withdraw its soldiers... from the blessed al-Aqsa mosque and Sheikh Jarrah” by 18:00. When the deadline passes without an Israeli response, rockets are fired towards Jerusalem for the first time in years. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says the group has “crossed a red line” and Israel retaliates with air strikes, killing three Hamas fighters. A continuing exchange of rocket-fire and air strikes quickly escalates into the fiercest hostilities between the two sides since they fought a war in 2014.

"Israeli PM Netanyahu says he is ""determined to carry on"" with the military operation in Gaza until ""calm and security are restored"" Earlier US President Biden told Netanyahu he expected a ""significant de-escalation"" on Wednesday Israel shells targets in Lebanon after four rockets were fired towards Israel from Lebanese territory Efforts to broker a truce between Israel and Palestinian militants continue, but little progress appears to have been made âThe operation is continuing at full throttle. There is still no ceasefire on the table,â Israeli defence sources tell the BBC Hamas officials, meanwhile, say ceasefire efforts ""are serious and continuingâ but Palestinian demands must be met New Israeli air strikes hit Gaza overnight as fighting entered a 10th day At least two militants were killed in strikes on apartment buildings in the territory Barrages of rockets were also fired into Israel, with Hamas saying it targeted an air base in the south Edited by Alix Kroeger This image shows rockets launched from Gaza towards Israel in a photo captured by an Israeli naval boat while patrolling in the Mediterranean Sea We're now pausing our live coverage of the ongoing Israel-Gaza conflict - many thanks for staying with us. To recap, here are the key developments from the past 24 hours:  Contributing to today's live page were David Gritten, Joshua Cheetham, Yaroslav Lukov, Gareth Evans, Thomas Spender, Alix Kroeger, Joshua Nevett and Mal Siret The conflict has inflicted a heavy human toll At least 227 people have been killed in Gaza since fighting between Israel and Palestinian militants in the enclave began, according to health officials. Gaza's health ministry said 64 children, 38  women, and 17 elderly people were among the dead, while 1,620 people were wounded. Israel's military says it has killed more than 100 Palestinian militants in Gaza. Hamas, the Palestinian militant group that runs the territory, does not give casualty figures for fighters. In Israel at least 12 people, including two children, have been killed, its medical authorities say. The violence in Gaza and Israel is the worst since 2014. Despite the best efforts of world leaders, there is currently no sign of a ceasefire. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (C) is among the Democratic lawmakers who backed the resolution Democratic lawmakers in the US have launched a last-minute push to block the sale of weapons to Israel as they call for a ceasefire in Gaza. Several progressive lawmakers in the Democratic-controlled House of Representatives have backed a resolution to stop the $735m (Â£520m) sale. But the resolution is expected to fail, because Democratic leaders in the legislative chamber have expressed support for the sale. The resolution is seen as a symbolic move to put pressure on US President Joe Biden, who told Israel's prime minister to move towards de-escalation earlier today. As the conflict has intensified, Biden has been confronted with growing disquiet among Democratic and Republican lawmakers over his position towards Israel. On the Democratic side, members of Congress have become more critical of Israel as they express concern for human rights in Gaza. Meanwhile, Republicans have accused Biden of not offering enough support to Israel in the face of rocket attacks by Palestinian militants. Israel's military conducts a strike near the border between Israel and the Gaza strip Israel's army says it has targeted the head of Hamas's military wing, Mohammed Deif, during the ongoing strikes on Gaza. A spokesman for the Israel Defense Forces (IDF), Brig Gen Hidai Zilberman, said Israel had tried to assassinate Deif, the head of the Izzedine al-Qassam Brigades. Deif, who has been on the Israeli army's most-wanted list for over two decades, has survived repeated attempts on his life over the years,including in the last major conflict in 2014. Israeli news website Ynet reported that in one of the operations, Deif had been in his bunker when Israel hit the location. He tends to stay in the background and his whereabouts remain unknown. Hamas has not confirmed the reports. A United Nations relief agency has been delivering aid to Gaza Israel has accused a United Nations relief agency of ""cynical misrepresentation"" for suggesting it was preventing humanitarian aid from entering the Gaza Strip. On Tuesday the aid agency for Palestinians, known as UNRWA,called on Israel to enable access to Gaza for humanitarian supplies and its staff.,external The agency said Israel had not approved such access and was therefore failing to meet its obligations under international law. But Israel's foreign ministry denied this in a statement on Wednesday. It said rocket fire from Palestinian militants in Gaza, not Israel, had halted the transfer of humanitarian aid on Tuesday and Wednesday. âUNRWAâs claim that Israel is preventing humanitarian aid from reaching Gaza is a cynical misrepresentation and simply a lie,â the statement said. ""Israel will continue its efforts to co-ordinate the transfer of humanitarian aid into Gaza, taking into account security considerations.â As the fighting enters its 10th day, and air strikes and rocket fire continue, let's take a look at what triggered the latest violence. It was sparked by days of escalating clashes between Palestinians and Israeli police at a holy hilltop compound in East Jerusalem earlier this month. The site is revered by both Muslims, who call it the Haram al-Sharif (Noble Sanctuary), and Jews, for whom it is known as the Temple Mount. Hamas demanded Israel remove police from there and the nearby predominantly Arab district of Sheikh Jarrah, where Palestinian families face eviction by Jewish settlers. Hamas launched rockets when its ultimatum went unheeded. Palestinian anger was further fuelled by Israel's annual celebration of its capture of East Jerusalem in the 1967 Middle East war, known as Jerusalem Day. The fate of the city, with its deep religious and national significance to both sides, lies at the heart of the decades-old Israel-Palestinian conflict. Prime Minister Boris Johnson vowed to root out anti-Semitism in the UK Now let's turn to the UK, where Prime Minister Boris Johnson has condemned a spike in anti-Semitic incidents in the country since the Israel-Gaza conflict began. Johnson was asked what he would do to support Jewish communities in the UK during questioning by opposition leader Sir Keir Starmer in parliament. ""I share his horror at the outbreak of anti-Semitic incidents and the government has conveyed that message loud and clear to those who are responsible for enforcing the law against hate crime,"" Johnson said. He said anti-Semitism must be called out ""at every stage"", adding: ""We will not let it take root, we will not allow it to grow and fester."" His comments came after 116 anti-Semitic incidents were reported over 11 days from 8 May in the UK - a five-fold increase on the previous period. Those incidents were recorded by the Community Security Trust (CST), which offers safety advice to the Jewish community in the UK. Recent incidents dealt with by the police includean attack on Rabbi Rafi Goodwin near his synagogue in north London. Hossein Salami says Palestinians have emerged as a ""missile-equipped nation"" The head of Iran's Islamic Revolution Guard Corps (IRGC) has said that Iran backs the Palestinians against what it calls the ""Zionist regime"" (Israel). In a televised address, Hossein Salami said the conflict showed that ""Palestinians have emerged as a missile-equipped nation."" Iran is a major supporter of Hamas, which it backs financially and militarily. The two sides fell out after Hamas refused to support Iran's ally, Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, in Syria's civil war. But the two sides have since reconciled. An escalation of fighting between Israelis and Palestinians has led the United Nations to warn of a ""full-scale war"". The latest violence followed weeks of rising tensions in Jerusalem, though the conflict has gone on for decades. Here's our explainer, looking at the key issues. The Israeli military has continued to carry out air strikes in Gaza in response to rocket fire from Palestinian militants Following news of Joe Biden's call for a ""de-escalation"", a Hamas spokesman in Gaza, Hazem Qassem, has told reporters that Israel has been refusing to engage with diplomatic efforts to end the violence. ""There are no specific dates for the issue of the ceasefire, because all the international efforts that are being made, as well as the Egyptian efforts, are met with an Israeli position that refuses to deal with ceasefire initiatives,"" he said. He told Reuters news agency that if Israel ended its ""bombardment on Gaza... there can be room to talk about
arrangements to restore calm"". Netanyahu has reaffirmed his commitment to Israeli strikes on Palestinian militants in Gaza Israeli's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has vowed to continue his government's operation against Palestinian militantsin a video statement posted to Twitter a short time ago,external. His comments came shortly after a phone call with US President Joe Biden, who told him to move towards de-escalation. While Netanyahu did not comment on the call, he said he appreciated Bidenâs support of Israelâs right to defend itself. However, he added: ""I am determined to continue this operation until its goal is achieved - to bring back peace and security to you, the citizens of Israel."" Diplomatic calls for a ceasefire have so far proved fruitless. BBC OS Two Israeli Arabs have told the BBC about their experiences of living in Israel since the fighting began Each day this week, we've been speaking to the different communities affected by the Israel-Gaza conflict. On Wednesday, we heard from friends Khadija and Adrieh, two Israeli Arab women.. Israeli Arabs are people who live in Israel but strongly identify with Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank. Both young mums, Khadija and Adrieh grew up together in Jaffa, a city with mixed communities of people with Palestinian and Jewish backgrounds. Since the fighting began, there have been flare-ups of intercommunal violence between Israeli Arabs and Jews across Israel. Khadija told the BBC she was afraid to go out and live her life as usual. ""Itâs not new to be afraid to be an Arab woman here in Israel, but itâs very new to me to be afraid to walk in my neighbourhood,"" she said. ""If you canât feel safe in your country, you canât feel like you belong to this country."" You can hear more from Khadija and Adrieh bylistening to BBC OS programme on World Service radio. The US has again said it will not back a French-proposed UN Security Council draft resolution calling for a ceasefire, stressing that it could undermine efforts to de-escalate the crisis, the AFP news agency reports. ""We've been clear and consistent that we are focused on intensive diplomatic efforts under way to bring an end to the violence and that we will not support actions that we believe undermine efforts to de-escalate,"" a US spokesperson at the UN told the news agency. The US is one of the five permanent UN Security Council members with a veto power. Earlier on Wednesday, US President Joe Biden told Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu in a phone conversation that he expected ""a significant de-escalation today on the path to a ceasefire"". This video can not be played MSF: Violence is curbing healthcare access in Gaza Dr Natalie Thurtle from medical NGO Doctors Without Borders (MSF) has been telling the BBC how her organisation has been struggling to provide medical care on the ground amid the continuing violence. âThe border to Gaza is closed and no humanitarian corridor has been negotiated,â she said, calling for an end to the fighting. Palestinians in Gaza, meanwhile, are ""frightened, their children are frightened, they are hiding in the basement every night"", she says. Barbara Plett UsherBBC News, Wilmington This is the first time that US President Joe Biden has directly and publicly pressed Israel for a ceasefire - or spoken with such urgency. Until now, he had been stressing Israelâs right to defend itself and insisting that Hamas stop its rocket fire. Today he told Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that this has to be the beginning of the end, to significantly wind down the Israeli operation on the way to a ceasefire. He linked his comments to what he said was progress in degrading Hamas' capabilities, and to the state of affairs in Gaza, which is facing a deepening humanitarian crisis. There's been increasing political and international pressure on Mr Biden to intervene more forcefully to push for an end to the violence. With another UN Security Council meeting set for tomorrow, he seems to be indicating that the US is becoming less willing to give Israel diplomatic cover. An area in the city of Shfaram in northern Israel is cordoned off after rockets were fired from Lebanon If you're just joining our coverage of the renewed fighting between Israel and Palestinian militants, here are the latest developments: Nine-year-old Yara (left) and five-year-old Rula (right) were killed alongside several family members on Sunday Of the 219 people killed in Gaza at least 63 are children, according to its health ministry, while of the 10 people killed in Israel, two children are among the dead, the country's medical service says. Among the children killed in Gaza were sisters Yara, 9, and Rula, 5 from the al-Kawalek family. Both had been receiving treatment for trauma from the Norwegian Refugee Council (NRC). The al-Kawaleks were polite girls who always did their homework on time, one of their teachers, who did not want be named, told the BBC. Ido Avigal, five, who was killed in a Hamas rocket attack The youngest victim on the Israeli side is thought to be Ido Avigal, a five-year-old boy killed last Wednesday in the southern town of Sderot. Ido was killed inside a fortified room in what the Israeli military described as an ""incredibly rare"" incident. Rocket shrapnel pierced the protective metal plating used to cover the window of the room he was in, also injuring his mother and seven-year-old sister. He died of his injuries hours later. Ibrahim al-Masry was playing with his siblings in the front yard of their home in a northern neighbourhood of Gaza last week, when a strike hit, according to reports. ""We were laughing and having fun, when suddenly they began to bomb us, everything around us caught fire,"" his brothertold the AFP news agency,external.

This video can not be played John Dugard: US not an honest broker in Israel-Gaza conflict John Dugard, a former United Nations Special Rapporteur to the UNHCR, has told the BBC that he believes the US is ""not an honest broker"" in the Israel-Gaza conflict. ""First of all there's the evidence provided by the failure of United States to support a [UN Security Council] resolution at this stage,"" Mr Dugard said. ""Secondly there's the fact that the US continues to operate its embassy from Jerusalem, which is contrary to international law."" The US has called for a ceasefire, but it has been blocking attempts by the UN Security Council to issue a joint statement, saying this would not help with the de-escalation of hostilities. We reported yesterday that two men from Thailand working at a packaging factory in southern Israel had been killed by Palestinian rocket-fire. The two men, who were employed at the Obad farming estate in Eshkol town, have been named as Sikharin Sangamram, 24, and Weerawat Karanborirak, 44. Israel's Kan News tweeted images of the two men.

At least eight other Thai workers were wounded in yesterday's rocket attack, Thailand's foreign ministry said. It's not unusual for citizens of Thailand to seek work in Israel, and the two countries have a good relationship. A senior Thai diplomat in Israel told the BBC that around 4,000 of the country's citizens had been working in southern Israel when the latest conflict erupted, but that some were relocated to safer areas over the weekend. Paul AdamsBBC diplomatic correspondent, Jerusalem As we reported earlier, US President Joe Biden spoke to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on the phone, telling him he expected a ""significant de-escalation today"". The tone of that call suggests the US is losing patience with Israelâs military attacks. With another UN Security Council meeting looming on Thursday, the White House is indicating that it may be less willing to offer diplomatic cover to Israel, one of its closest allies. Speaking to foreign ambassadors this morning, Netanyahu said it was not possible to set a timeframe on the operation in Gaza. Last night, local reports in Israel suggested a ceasefire could be announced as early as Thursday morning. But these reports have not been confirmed. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Ministers hope the scheme will create opportunities for a younger, more eco-savvy, generation to own farmland Older farmers in England will be paid to retire under a UK government scheme to bring new blood into the trade. The average farmer could receive a lump sum payment of Â£50,000 - capped at Â£100,000 for farmers with most land. It is part of a massive overhaul of farm grants, incentivising farmers to protect the environment. Some older farmers are resistant to new ""green"" methods, Environment Secretary George Eustice believes, and he wants them to move on. Next steps in England's rural revolution unveiled âRadicalâ changes to farming in post-Brexit plan UK farmers to need 'thousands of foreign workers' Currently, under the old EU system, farmers receive grants based largely on the amount of land they farm. The average farmer currently receives about Â£21,000 in grants - althoughthose who own large amounts of land, such as the Queen, have been receiving more than half a million pounds each year. Farmers in Wales are expected to be able to benefit from a similar scheme to the England plans announced by Mr Eustice. Plans in Scotland and Northern Ireland will be different. Mr Eustice says the EU's grants system encourages some farmers ""to coast, to take no risks"" and hold on to their land in order to collect the subsidy. Hence the need for help for older farmers to move on. At the Oxford Farming Conference earlier this year, Mr Eustice said some veteran farmers were ""standing in the way of change"" and coasting along on state subsidies. He said: ""I understand the burden of expectation that can exist to loyally continue the family tradition (of farming) and how this sometimes stands in the way of change."" But, he said: ""A fresh perspective can make a world of difference. New entrants are the lifeblood of any vibrant industry and farming is no exception."" A spokesman for the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra), told BBC News: ""There's evidence that farmers who wish to leave farming can find it difficult to generate capital to do so. ""So, a lump sum payment could help contribute to the costs of moving somewhere new or moving into an alternative sector."" Nearly four in 10 UK farmers are over the age of 65, with an average age of 59. The agriculture sector accounts for about 9 per cent of the UK's annual greenhouse gas emissions The Tenant Farmers' Association sought the views of 360 farmers and reported that three-quarters of them were seriously interested in the proposed retirement scheme, which is launched in a consultation today. The organisation's chief executive, George Dunn, told BBC News he supported the plan for a lump sum for farmers based on the grants they would have received if they'd stayed in business. But he warned: ""The government have got to make it easy enough for people to take up the scheme - not drown them in bureaucracy. ""The payments on their own won't be enough - but when you tie in other factors such as selling livestock, some farmers will want to take it up. ""For people on larger holdings, it won't be very attractive - but a lot of owner-occupiers might find it attractive."" At the launch of today's consultation, Mr Eustice explained: ""We need to address the twin challenges of helping new entrants fulfil their dream and gain access to land, while also helping an older generation retire with dignity. ""Our exit scheme will offer farmers real incentive to confront what can often be a difficult decision and will help them clear bills and settle debts."" A spokesperson for the National Farmers' Union (NFU) said: ""As our agricultural support is overhauled, farm businesses across the country will be making life-changing decisions about the future of their farm."" They added: ""We want to see a fair transition which allows farmers who are considering leaving the industry to have sufficient time and information to make those life-changing decisions."" About Â£3bn of state subsidy is paid to UK farmers each year, but this will be phased out. An estimated 61% of farm income comes from subsidy. Under the new post-Brexit scheme, grants will be used to incentivise so-called ""public goods"", such as protecting water supplies; holding floodwater on land; capturing carbon in soil and trees, and increasing wildlife. The government believes that younger farmers will be more open to new nature-friendly ideas and more inclined to seek income by diversifying into businesses such as camping or glamping. Clarification 8th March 2022: This article was amended on the day of publication to make clear that the scheme is for older farmers in England and that farmers in Wales are expected to be able to benefit from a similar scheme, while plans in Scotland and Northern Ireland will be different.

"Boris Johnson has been facing questions from MPs in the Commons The PM says âwe have increasing confidence that vaccines are effective against all variants, including the Indian variant"" Mr Johnson repeats a warning people should not be going on holiday to countries on the government's amber travel list Labour leader Keir Starmer says ministers have given conflicting information about travel to places on the amber list The PM says you should not be going to an amber list country unless itâs a serious reason such as visiting a seriously ill relative He begins the session by reading the names of the 10 innocent victims of the Ballymurphy shootings of 1971 The PM says he is sorry for the pain their families have endured - when the inquest ended last week he was criticised for sending a written apology The SNP and Plaid Cymru both say a Brexit trade deal with Australia will be bad news for UK farmers, amid concern over cheap food imports The PM says the SNP's Ian Blackford is not doing justice to farmers and crofters and he asks why he is ""so scared of free trade"" Edited by Johanna Howitt Thanks for following along with us today. The team on board with you today was James Clarke, Paul Seddon, Richard Morris and Sinead Wilson. Hope you will join us again next week. PMQs was dominated by questions about the government's current travel advice, and the prevalence of the Indian variant of coronavirus. It's thought to be responsible for the majority of new positive cases in pockets of England. One of three subtypes of the virus identified on the subcontinent, variant B.1.617.2 is thought to spread more easily - but what does that mean for you? Read our guide here:Where is it, how does it spread and is it more infectious? Reality Check The prime
minister was asked how many people were travelling to and from countries on the
governmentâs âamber listâ every day. Boris Johnson
replied: ""There has been a 95% reduction in travel of any kind to and
from this country."" This figure seems
to come from a report published last summer by the Office for National
Statistics (ONS) which compared passenger numbers in June 2019 with traffic
from June 2020. According to the
ONS, ""overseas residents made an estimated 176,000 visits to the UK in
June 2020, which was 95% fewer than in June 2019."" Itâs worth noting
that June 2020 was when the UK was coming out of the first lockdown and these
dates are obviously before the introduction of the traffic light system
(including the amber list) for England. Here are the headlines from today's session: Reality Check At Prime Ministerâs Questions, Labour leader Keir Starmer
accused the government of having âlost control of the messagingâ over its
advice for people on travelling to countries on its âamber listâ. There islots of advice on the government,externalwebsite about coming back from these countries (which include
France, Spain and Italy). This includes taking Covid tests, filling out a passenger locator form and
self-isolating at home for 10 days. On going out, it says simply ââYou should not travel to amber list countries or
territoriesâ. From Monday, it is no longer illegal to go to these countries
though. But yesterday, Environment
Secretary George Eustice said: ""There
will be reasons why people feel they need to travel [to amber list countries]
either to visit family or indeed to visit friends but they then have to observe
quarantine when they return."" Later,
Boris Johnson said it was âvery important people grasp what the amber list is â
not somewhere to go on holidayâ and said people should only travel to these
countries for âpressing family or business reasonsâ. Then,
Health Minister Lord Bethell said overseas travel was âdangerousâ, telling
peers âThe ultimate sanction here is thatâ¦we tell people: travelling is not for
this year. Please stay in this country.â Read our guide:which countries are on the green list for travel? Leila NathooBBC political correspondent Keir Starmer branded the
government's travel advice as 'confused and contradictory', raising the prospect
of Britain as an island nation battening down the hatches to protect against
new Covid variants. But although Boris
Johnson tried to be definitive that travel to countries officially designated
as amber should only be for 'extreme' reasons - he also reminded MPs that the
government was trying to move away from 'endlessly legislating' and relying on people
to follow guidance and do the right thing. It's a shift in approach
he is increasingly keen to stress. Labour's Justin Madders says it has been 664 days since the PM said he had a plan for social care. He says the Department for Health and Social Care is now advertising for policy adviser roles for social care reform. He asks ""do you have a plan, yes or no?"" ""Yes is the answer,"" Johnson replies, ""this is something that for decades politicians have failed to address."" He says Labour had 13 years in power and ""didn't do it, this government is going to tackle it."" Labour's Andy Slaughter asks about Jenny McGee - a nurse who treated the PM for Covid but has nowresigned from the NHSand criticised ministers' handling of the pandemic. ""Surely he must pause and think what can be learned from mistakes of the past year,"" he says - also calling on the PM to ""think again"" about the proposed 1% cash-terms pay rise for NHS staff in England. Boris Johnson says he ""knows how hard it has been"" for nurses this year, and acknowledges his own ""personal debt"" to the work of nurses in the NHS. He says the 1% pay rise has been proposed despite ""very tough times"" financially - and the government is delivering a promise to recruit ""many more nurses"" for the health service. Conservative MP Danny Kruger raises the issue of the treatment of army veterans who have served in Northern Ireland. He says feelings are running high in his constituency and asks if  legislation will be brought forward to protect military personnel from prosecution? The PM says he recognises ""how difficult and how complex"" the matter is. He says these issues are fraught but ministers will introduce fresh legislation and a package to protect veterans from vexatious legislation. Plaid Cymru's Hywel Williams says that it looks as if the government is going to start backing Australian farmers, rather than Welsh farmers. Johnson says it is a ""disgrace that not a single morsel of Welsh lamb has passed the lips of an American in the past twenty years,"" he says that he supports British and Welsh farmers. Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey criticises the government's Planning Bill, which he says will ""do nothing"" to solve local housing problems and allow developers to ""ride roughshod"" over local communities. Quoting former PM Theresa May, he says the new law will lead to the ""wrong homes in the wrong places"". Boris Johnson rejects this - and pledges the green belt will be protected as part of the ""sensible reforms"". He says young people have been ""deprived for too long"" of the chance to own a home and the Planning Bill will help to change this. Conservative Jo Gideon says there's ""no better example of levelling-up"" than from her constituency of Stoke-On-Trent receiving help for their YMCA, as well as more government offices moving to the town. Johnson says ""We are sending, not just back offices, but some of the most important departments of state"" which will be run from across the UK ""and I believe that will have a dramatic effect on levelling-up the UK,"" he states. SNP Westminster leader Ian Blackford is up. He says as someone who is part of the crofting community, he understands how disastrous a Brexit trade deal with Australia will be for Scottish farmers, who he says will lose their livelihoods and lands. Will the PM categorically rule out that the UK government is about to sign up to a deal that will rule out tariff free access for things like beef he asks? The prime minister says Blackford is not doing justice to farmers and crofters and he asks why he is ""so scared of free trade"". Blackford says the fact the PM doesn't give a straight answer will send a chill down the spines of farmers who he says are about to be ""thrown under the Brexit bus"". ""This will be the final nail in the coffin"" for Scottish  crofters he adds. Mr Johnson replies that this view underestimates the ability of people of this country to make the most of free trade. ""Our food exports are second to none"", he says. Sir Keir Starmer picks up from the PM's comment and says the Labour Party has been calling for a blanket hotel quarantine ""for months"" and now the UK has the Indian variant spreading. He says experts have called the UK's border controls during the pandemic ""a joke"" and flights are still coming in from India. Sir Keir then changes topic for his final question and says there has been a rise in anti-Semitic attacks in the UK following recent developments in Gaza. He says Jewish communities are remaining ""very anxious"". Johnson says he ""shares his horror at the rise of anti-Semitic incidents"" and he says the government ""will continue to work"" to support the Jewish community ""in any way we can"". ""We will call this out at every stage,"" he adds. Sir Keir says government guidance on amber list countries is ""confused and contradictory"". He says the prime minister can't say ""how many or when"" people are travelling to amber-listed countries - calls on ministers to introduce a ""proper system"" to guard against future variants. In reply, Boris Johnson says it would be better if the Labour leader uses ""what authority he possesses"" to encourage people to follow government guidance. He also attacks Labour's own position on borders as ""hopelessly confused"". Starmer says it is not just a coincidence that bookings to these countries are up he says - it is because of the messaging. The PM says there has been a 95% reduction in travel to the UK  which is what you would expect. He says the reason the UK is able to move forward is because of the speed of the vaccine roll-out with 70% of adults in this country getting a jab. Sir Keir Starmer says ""absolute clarity is needed about the circumstances over which people can travel to an amber country"". He says yesterday ministers gave conflicting information about whether or not people should be travelling. He says the government's ""lost control of the messaging"". He asks if the PM doesn't want people to travel to amber list countries, why has he made it easier for people to do so. Johnson says what the public would like to see is ""back up"" from the opposition to provide clarity of message. ""It is very, very clear, you should not be going to an amber list country, except for some extreme circumstance, such as a family illness,"" the PM says, ""you should not be going to an amber list country for a holiday"". He adds: ""If you do go to an amber list country, we will enforce the ten day quarantine period."" If people break the rules, he says, they face ""very substantial fines"". Sir Keir asks why 170 countries were moved onto England's amber list when travel restrictions changed on Monday - adding this ""weakened"" the rules. Boris Johnson says the UK has ""one of the strongest border regimes in the world"". He adds that people returning from amber list countries have to pay to get tested and self-isolate at home when they return. Keir Starmer is up with his first question. He asks if the PM agrees that the single biggest threat to the lockdown easing is new variants coming in to the UK? Boris Johnson says it is one of the issues we must face. But he says the government has looked at the data this morning and have increasing confidence the vaccines are effective on all variants, including the Indian variant. He thanks people for coming forward in  record numbers in Bolton and Blackburn to be vaccinated. Prime Minister Boris Johnson opens PMQs by reading the names of the ten Ballymurphy the victims. There had been some criticism of awritten apologythe PM sent to the victims' families. Johnson notes that the inquest found those who were killed in Ballymurphy in 1971 were ""entirely innocent"" he says he is ""sorry"" for the ""pain they have endured"" among their families. He says he hopes that they can ""take some comfort"" in the decision that has been reached by the inquest. Labour's Gareth Thomas has the first question and says it is four years since the Grenfell Tower fire and dangerous cladding has still not been replaced on many buildings. He asks why the PM instructed his MPs to vote against measures to tackle the problems yesterday. Johnson says ""we have provided an unprecedented Â£5bn of investment"" and ""the most dangerous cladding"" has been removed from high rise buildings already. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Lee and Louise know they'll be taking their two children on holiday this summer. What they don't know is where they'll go. It might be Norfolk or it might be their preference - Fuerteventura. They booked both in case Covid restrictions prevented them from going to the Canary Islands. And because they're not the only ones doing this, some UK resorts fear they could be facing a rush of cancellations. Low and no-deposit bookings have been offered by lots of companies this summer to allow extra flexibility because of the Covid pandemic. While that's led to record bookings for lots of UK resorts, plenty of customers have taken advantage by booking not one, but two holidays for the same time slot, knowing they'll not lose any money at all. I spoke to Lee and Louise under a gazebo in their garden, in the pouring rain, in Lancashire, so it's no surprise that they are holding onto a dream of basking in the sunshine. They've booked time off work and are determined to get away somewhere. When they splashed out on a holiday to the Canary islands they weren't sure if travel there would be allowed, so they booked a reserve option too. They're keeping both bookings and hedging their bets a little longer, in the hopes of guaranteed heat, while ensuring themselves a get-away somewhere. Although they love Cromer in Norfolk, there is no hesitation when I ask which holiday they'd rather go on. ""Fuerteventura, fingers-crossed"", says Louise. Lee and Louise have booked two getaways this summer so they don't miss out altogether She says: ""In this country it can be a bit more difficult to find things to do if the weather is not great."" Lee says the family all get so excited about the prospect of a holiday, that after a tough year, they are determined to make sure they have a great summer. ""You start planning, you start preparing, and if that's suddenly taken away it can actually impact our mental well-being,"" explains Lee. That's why they are keeping the Norfolk booking and will decide nearer the time. And it seems Lee, Louise and their children may not be alone. The peak for holiday bookings came early on in the year, before the government issued its rules on travel. Plenty of people are still hoping for some amendments before the summer holiday season begins, so some industry insiders reckon they may have doubled-booked in order to keep their options open. Avvio provides the software behind 500 of the UK's top hotels. They say bookings are very high but cancellation rates at the moment are running at just 4%, far below the usual 30% levels. Chief commercial officer Michael De Jongh says this is because of double-bookings, although concrete evidence of the phenomenon won't kick in until later this summer, when consumers actually start cancelling UK trips in favour of European ones or vice versa. He says cancellations would cause problems for hotels, in the same way as multiple restaurant bookings did during the Chancellor Rishi Sunak's Eat Out To Help Out scheme. ""There's a growing trend to book rooms at multiple hotels, with a view to cancelling all but one at the last minute. This causes so many problems for hotels, in the same way as multiple restaurant bookings did during Eat Out To Help Out. ""If someone does have to cancel,"" he says, ""I'd urge them to always give the hotel as much notice as possible or better still modify the booking to an alternative date."" At Hipping Hall hotel, George Norrie says if people cancel early enough he should be able to fill the rooms Hipping Hall, like most venues, has kept its bookings policy as flexible as possible to allow people to book without fear of losing money. It's a small boutique hotel in Kirkby Lonsdale, part-way between the Lake District and the Yorkshire Dales. It's only been able to open its doors to guests again this week, and its 15 rooms are fully booked for months to come. General manager George Norrie says if people cancel with enough notice, the hotel should be able to fill the slot, because on some nights it even has a waiting list. He thinks the bigger challenge for them is giving first-time staycation holidaymakers a brilliant experience so that they come back again next year. ""When our guests get here we're going to do our best to make sure they get the best experience they possibly can. Next year they might go abroad, but they might come and see us for a two-day stay as well."" Lee and Louise say they'll make sure they give enough notice for either of their chosen destinations to fill the slot, and the flexible booking they were given means they won't lose any money. For them it's a win-win. While a late flurry of cancellations may cause headaches for UK hoteliers, there is good news for disorganised holidaymakers. There'll be plenty of last-minute bargains for UK holidays, whatever the weather.

"This video can not be played Malawi has incinerated thousands of expired coronavirus vaccine doses Health authorities in Malawi have incinerated 19,610 expired doses of the AstraZeneca coronavirus vaccine, saying it will reassure the public that any vaccines they do get are safe. It is the first African country to publicly do this. The World Health Organization initially urged countries not to destroy expired doses but has now changed its advice. Uptake of the vaccine in Malawi has been low and health workers hope the move will increase public confidence. Out of a population of about 18 million people, the country has recorded 34,232 confirmed coronavirus cases and 1,153 deaths. Africa Live: Latest updates on this and other stories Why are vaccines going to waste in Africa? DR Congo in race against time to vaccinate people Malawi received 102,000 doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine it acquired from the African Union on 26 March and used almost 80% of them. But the expiry date on the labels was 13 April and officials say this wasn't enough time to use them all. So in a 30-minute process, officials destroyed thousands of Covid-19 vaccines, leaving behind just broken pieces of the vials holding the liquid. Malawi's Health Minister Khumbize Chiponda (l) helped put the vaccines into a hospital incineration chamber Malawi's principal health secretary told the BBC that it was unfortunate they had to destroy the vaccines but the benefits outweighed the risks. ""When news spread that we had out-of-date vaccines, we noticed that people were not coming to our clinics to get immunised,"" said Dr Charles Mwansambo. ""If we don't burn them, people will think that we are using expired vaccines in our facilities and if they don't come, Covid-19 will hit them hard."" The government says it has adequate stocks of vaccines and has urged everyone over 18 years old to get a jab. In addition to the 102,000 from the African Union, it has received 300,000 doses under the Covax vaccine-sharing facility and 50,000 sourced direct from India. However, future supplies could be threatened by India's decision to halt exports. The vaccines had been taken out of cold storage some time ago On the streets of the capital Lilongwe, some people are worried about the safety of the vaccine. ""I would like to get vaccinated but how sure am I if I go to the hospital I won't be given the expired vaccines?"" shopkeeper Jack Chitete told the BBC. ""I have heard a lot of stories about people getting blood clots and some even dying after getting immunised. Are those people telling lies? If it is the truth, why are we being given the same vaccines?"" asked another shopkeeper, Mphatso Chipenda. The link between the AstraZeneca vaccine and rare blood clots is not yet proven, and health experts say the risk from Covid-19 is far higher. They advise people to get vaccinated if they can. Rare blood clots - what you need to know Malawi is not the only country in Africa to have expired vaccines. The WHO initially asked affected countries to hold onto the vaccines until it could establish whether they could still be used. But it now says vaccines already sent out by the manufacturer with a set expiry date should be destroyed. ""While discarding vaccines is deeply regrettable in the context of any immunisation programme, WHO recommends that these expired doses should be removed from the distribution chain and safely disposed of,""it said in a statement,externalon 17 May. Other vaccines that are currently in use have a shelf life of up to 36 months. The challenge with Covid-19 vaccines is that they have been in use for less than a year and there is no substantive data around their effectiveness after long periods.

"Boris Johnson has been facing questions from MPs in the Commons The PM says âwe have increasing confidence that vaccines are effective against all variants, including the Indian variant"" Mr Johnson repeats a warning people should not be going on holiday to countries on the government's amber travel list Labour leader Keir Starmer says ministers have given conflicting information about travel to places on the amber list The PM says you should not be going to an amber list country unless itâs a serious reason such as visiting a seriously ill relative He begins the session by reading the names of the 10 innocent victims of the Ballymurphy shootings of 1971 The PM says he is sorry for the pain their families have endured - when the inquest ended last week he was criticised for sending a written apology The SNP and Plaid Cymru both say a Brexit trade deal with Australia will be bad news for UK farmers, amid concern over cheap food imports The PM says the SNP's Ian Blackford is not doing justice to farmers and crofters and he asks why he is ""so scared of free trade"" Edited by Johanna Howitt Thanks for following along with us today. The team on board with you today was James Clarke, Paul Seddon, Richard Morris and Sinead Wilson. Hope you will join us again next week. PMQs was dominated by questions about the government's current travel advice, and the prevalence of the Indian variant of coronavirus. It's thought to be responsible for the majority of new positive cases in pockets of England. One of three subtypes of the virus identified on the subcontinent, variant B.1.617.2 is thought to spread more easily - but what does that mean for you? Read our guide here:Where is it, how does it spread and is it more infectious? Reality Check The prime
minister was asked how many people were travelling to and from countries on the
governmentâs âamber listâ every day. Boris Johnson
replied: ""There has been a 95% reduction in travel of any kind to and
from this country."" This figure seems
to come from a report published last summer by the Office for National
Statistics (ONS) which compared passenger numbers in June 2019 with traffic
from June 2020. According to the
ONS, ""overseas residents made an estimated 176,000 visits to the UK in
June 2020, which was 95% fewer than in June 2019."" Itâs worth noting
that June 2020 was when the UK was coming out of the first lockdown and these
dates are obviously before the introduction of the traffic light system
(including the amber list) for England. Here are the headlines from today's session: Reality Check At Prime Ministerâs Questions, Labour leader Keir Starmer
accused the government of having âlost control of the messagingâ over its
advice for people on travelling to countries on its âamber listâ. There islots of advice on the government,externalwebsite about coming back from these countries (which include
France, Spain and Italy). This includes taking Covid tests, filling out a passenger locator form and
self-isolating at home for 10 days. On going out, it says simply ââYou should not travel to amber list countries or
territoriesâ. From Monday, it is no longer illegal to go to these countries
though. But yesterday, Environment
Secretary George Eustice said: ""There
will be reasons why people feel they need to travel [to amber list countries]
either to visit family or indeed to visit friends but they then have to observe
quarantine when they return."" Later,
Boris Johnson said it was âvery important people grasp what the amber list is â
not somewhere to go on holidayâ and said people should only travel to these
countries for âpressing family or business reasonsâ. Then,
Health Minister Lord Bethell said overseas travel was âdangerousâ, telling
peers âThe ultimate sanction here is thatâ¦we tell people: travelling is not for
this year. Please stay in this country.â Read our guide:which countries are on the green list for travel? Leila NathooBBC political correspondent Keir Starmer branded the
government's travel advice as 'confused and contradictory', raising the prospect
of Britain as an island nation battening down the hatches to protect against
new Covid variants. But although Boris
Johnson tried to be definitive that travel to countries officially designated
as amber should only be for 'extreme' reasons - he also reminded MPs that the
government was trying to move away from 'endlessly legislating' and relying on people
to follow guidance and do the right thing. It's a shift in approach
he is increasingly keen to stress. Labour's Justin Madders says it has been 664 days since the PM said he had a plan for social care. He says the Department for Health and Social Care is now advertising for policy adviser roles for social care reform. He asks ""do you have a plan, yes or no?"" ""Yes is the answer,"" Johnson replies, ""this is something that for decades politicians have failed to address."" He says Labour had 13 years in power and ""didn't do it, this government is going to tackle it."" Labour's Andy Slaughter asks about Jenny McGee - a nurse who treated the PM for Covid but has nowresigned from the NHSand criticised ministers' handling of the pandemic. ""Surely he must pause and think what can be learned from mistakes of the past year,"" he says - also calling on the PM to ""think again"" about the proposed 1% cash-terms pay rise for NHS staff in England. Boris Johnson says he ""knows how hard it has been"" for nurses this year, and acknowledges his own ""personal debt"" to the work of nurses in the NHS. He says the 1% pay rise has been proposed despite ""very tough times"" financially - and the government is delivering a promise to recruit ""many more nurses"" for the health service. Conservative MP Danny Kruger raises the issue of the treatment of army veterans who have served in Northern Ireland. He says feelings are running high in his constituency and asks if  legislation will be brought forward to protect military personnel from prosecution? The PM says he recognises ""how difficult and how complex"" the matter is. He says these issues are fraught but ministers will introduce fresh legislation and a package to protect veterans from vexatious legislation. Plaid Cymru's Hywel Williams says that it looks as if the government is going to start backing Australian farmers, rather than Welsh farmers. Johnson says it is a ""disgrace that not a single morsel of Welsh lamb has passed the lips of an American in the past twenty years,"" he says that he supports British and Welsh farmers. Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey criticises the government's Planning Bill, which he says will ""do nothing"" to solve local housing problems and allow developers to ""ride roughshod"" over local communities. Quoting former PM Theresa May, he says the new law will lead to the ""wrong homes in the wrong places"". Boris Johnson rejects this - and pledges the green belt will be protected as part of the ""sensible reforms"". He says young people have been ""deprived for too long"" of the chance to own a home and the Planning Bill will help to change this. Conservative Jo Gideon says there's ""no better example of levelling-up"" than from her constituency of Stoke-On-Trent receiving help for their YMCA, as well as more government offices moving to the town. Johnson says ""We are sending, not just back offices, but some of the most important departments of state"" which will be run from across the UK ""and I believe that will have a dramatic effect on levelling-up the UK,"" he states. SNP Westminster leader Ian Blackford is up. He says as someone who is part of the crofting community, he understands how disastrous a Brexit trade deal with Australia will be for Scottish farmers, who he says will lose their livelihoods and lands. Will the PM categorically rule out that the UK government is about to sign up to a deal that will rule out tariff free access for things like beef he asks? The prime minister says Blackford is not doing justice to farmers and crofters and he asks why he is ""so scared of free trade"". Blackford says the fact the PM doesn't give a straight answer will send a chill down the spines of farmers who he says are about to be ""thrown under the Brexit bus"". ""This will be the final nail in the coffin"" for Scottish  crofters he adds. Mr Johnson replies that this view underestimates the ability of people of this country to make the most of free trade. ""Our food exports are second to none"", he says. Sir Keir Starmer picks up from the PM's comment and says the Labour Party has been calling for a blanket hotel quarantine ""for months"" and now the UK has the Indian variant spreading. He says experts have called the UK's border controls during the pandemic ""a joke"" and flights are still coming in from India. Sir Keir then changes topic for his final question and says there has been a rise in anti-Semitic attacks in the UK following recent developments in Gaza. He says Jewish communities are remaining ""very anxious"". Johnson says he ""shares his horror at the rise of anti-Semitic incidents"" and he says the government ""will continue to work"" to support the Jewish community ""in any way we can"". ""We will call this out at every stage,"" he adds. Sir Keir says government guidance on amber list countries is ""confused and contradictory"". He says the prime minister can't say ""how many or when"" people are travelling to amber-listed countries - calls on ministers to introduce a ""proper system"" to guard against future variants. In reply, Boris Johnson says it would be better if the Labour leader uses ""what authority he possesses"" to encourage people to follow government guidance. He also attacks Labour's own position on borders as ""hopelessly confused"". Starmer says it is not just a coincidence that bookings to these countries are up he says - it is because of the messaging. The PM says there has been a 95% reduction in travel to the UK  which is what you would expect. He says the reason the UK is able to move forward is because of the speed of the vaccine roll-out with 70% of adults in this country getting a jab. Sir Keir Starmer says ""absolute clarity is needed about the circumstances over which people can travel to an amber country"". He says yesterday ministers gave conflicting information about whether or not people should be travelling. He says the government's ""lost control of the messaging"". He asks if the PM doesn't want people to travel to amber list countries, why has he made it easier for people to do so. Johnson says what the public would like to see is ""back up"" from the opposition to provide clarity of message. ""It is very, very clear, you should not be going to an amber list country, except for some extreme circumstance, such as a family illness,"" the PM says, ""you should not be going to an amber list country for a holiday"". He adds: ""If you do go to an amber list country, we will enforce the ten day quarantine period."" If people break the rules, he says, they face ""very substantial fines"". Sir Keir asks why 170 countries were moved onto England's amber list when travel restrictions changed on Monday - adding this ""weakened"" the rules. Boris Johnson says the UK has ""one of the strongest border regimes in the world"". He adds that people returning from amber list countries have to pay to get tested and self-isolate at home when they return. Keir Starmer is up with his first question. He asks if the PM agrees that the single biggest threat to the lockdown easing is new variants coming in to the UK? Boris Johnson says it is one of the issues we must face. But he says the government has looked at the data this morning and have increasing confidence the vaccines are effective on all variants, including the Indian variant. He thanks people for coming forward in  record numbers in Bolton and Blackburn to be vaccinated. Prime Minister Boris Johnson opens PMQs by reading the names of the ten Ballymurphy the victims. There had been some criticism of awritten apologythe PM sent to the victims' families. Johnson notes that the inquest found those who were killed in Ballymurphy in 1971 were ""entirely innocent"" he says he is ""sorry"" for the ""pain they have endured"" among their families. He says he hopes that they can ""take some comfort"" in the decision that has been reached by the inquest. Labour's Gareth Thomas has the first question and says it is four years since the Grenfell Tower fire and dangerous cladding has still not been replaced on many buildings. He asks why the PM instructed his MPs to vote against measures to tackle the problems yesterday. Johnson says ""we have provided an unprecedented Â£5bn of investment"" and ""the most dangerous cladding"" has been removed from high rise buildings already. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Former US President Donald Trump has lashed out after the New York attorney general said her inquiry into the Trump Organisation was now a criminal probe. Letitia James, the state's top prosecutor, has been scrutinising the ex-Republican president's financial dealings before he took office. A spokesperson for Ms James said the inquiry into Mr Trump's property company was ""no longer purely civil"". Mr Trump on Wednesday said she was ""in desperate search of a crime"". Ms James' spokesman, Fabien Levy, told the BBC on Tuesday: ""We have informed the Trump Organization that our investigation into the Organization is no longer purely civil in nature. ""We are now actively investigating the Trump Organization in a criminal capacity, along with the Manhattan DA. We have no additional comment."" The offices of the state attorney general and city district attorney are separate and, according to National Public Radio (NPR), have historically been rivals. The fact that they are now co-ordinating their efforts underscores the high profile of their investigation. The two prosecutors are combing through millions of pages of financial information in a search for evidence, reports NPR. The statement did not say what turned the inquiry from civil to criminal in nature, or whether the former president himself might be personally implicated in any allegations. Mr Trump accused Ms James and District Attorney Cyrus Vance, both Democrats, of being ""possessed"" by their political vendettas against him. A statement from his office rebuked the investigation as ""a continuation of the greatest political Witch Hunt in the history of the United States"". ""After prosecutorial efforts the likes of which nobody has ever seen before, they failed to stop me in Washington, so they turned it over to New York to do their dirty work. This is what I have been going through for years,"" he wrote. The former president's eldest son, Donald Trump Jr, condemned the inquiry as ""flagrant abuse of political office"". On Twitter, he shared an old video of Ms James promising to pursue all legal options against Mr Trump while she was still campaigning for the attorney general role. The video drew fiery comments from other top Trump allies, like senior advisor Stephen Miller, who said the US system of law was being turned into ""a weapon of vengeance not an instrument of justice"". Civil cases usually have to do with injury to individuals or other private parties, including businesses; criminal law applies in cases where the damage is thought to affect society at large, including the state. Six legal battles looming for Trump Ms James launched a civil inquiry in March 2019 into claims that Mr Trump had inflated the value of his assets to banks when seeking loans, and understated them to lower his taxes. Her office has also been seeking documents on four Trump Organization properties in Manhattan, upstate New York, Chicago and Los Angeles. Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr said in court documents last August that his office was investigating alleged ""protracted criminal conduct"" at the Trump Organization. Mr Vance's legal filing cited newspaper articles about purported bank and insurance fraud at the company. The Manhattan district attorney has also been investigating whether any of Mr Trump's financial records were doctored to cover up hush-money payments to two women in 2016 who say they had affairs with him. Mr Vance's office said in February it had obtained Mr Trump's tax returns as part of the investigation, after a long legal battle. Throughout his presidency, Mr Trump resolutely refused to reveal his tax returns, despite coming under great pressure to do so. Allen Weisselberg, the chief financial officer of the Trump Organization, and members of his family have been the focus of the investigators. The clock is ticking. Mr Vance leaves office in December, and he would be expected file any criminal complaint by the end of the year. Will Grant, BBC News, Washington DC Throughout his time in office, Donald Trump dismissed any probe into his financial dealings or those of his organisation as a politically-motivated ""witch hunt"" led by Democrats desperate to see him forced from power. Yet now that he no longer enjoys protection from prosecution, this latest development will trouble him. That a former US president is facing not one but two criminal investigations is a significant development, one which could have repercussions for his political future. The New York State Attorney General, Letitia James, clearly believes that there is enough at play to warrant moving the investigation from a civil to a criminal one. When combined with the ongoing examination of the former president's tax returns by the Manhattan District Attorney, Cy Vance, Mr Trump is looking at a complex and tangled legal battle ahead â one which he remains adamant he shouldn't have to face but which he now almost certainly cannot avoid.

"Ministers hope the scheme will create opportunities for a younger, more eco-savvy, generation to own farmland Older farmers in England will be paid to retire under a UK government scheme to bring new blood into the trade. The average farmer could receive a lump sum payment of Â£50,000 - capped at Â£100,000 for farmers with most land. It is part of a massive overhaul of farm grants, incentivising farmers to protect the environment. Some older farmers are resistant to new ""green"" methods, Environment Secretary George Eustice believes, and he wants them to move on. Next steps in England's rural revolution unveiled âRadicalâ changes to farming in post-Brexit plan UK farmers to need 'thousands of foreign workers' Currently, under the old EU system, farmers receive grants based largely on the amount of land they farm. The average farmer currently receives about Â£21,000 in grants - althoughthose who own large amounts of land, such as the Queen, have been receiving more than half a million pounds each year. Farmers in Wales are expected to be able to benefit from a similar scheme to the England plans announced by Mr Eustice. Plans in Scotland and Northern Ireland will be different. Mr Eustice says the EU's grants system encourages some farmers ""to coast, to take no risks"" and hold on to their land in order to collect the subsidy. Hence the need for help for older farmers to move on. At the Oxford Farming Conference earlier this year, Mr Eustice said some veteran farmers were ""standing in the way of change"" and coasting along on state subsidies. He said: ""I understand the burden of expectation that can exist to loyally continue the family tradition (of farming) and how this sometimes stands in the way of change."" But, he said: ""A fresh perspective can make a world of difference. New entrants are the lifeblood of any vibrant industry and farming is no exception."" A spokesman for the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra), told BBC News: ""There's evidence that farmers who wish to leave farming can find it difficult to generate capital to do so. ""So, a lump sum payment could help contribute to the costs of moving somewhere new or moving into an alternative sector."" Nearly four in 10 UK farmers are over the age of 65, with an average age of 59. The agriculture sector accounts for about 9 per cent of the UK's annual greenhouse gas emissions The Tenant Farmers' Association sought the views of 360 farmers and reported that three-quarters of them were seriously interested in the proposed retirement scheme, which is launched in a consultation today. The organisation's chief executive, George Dunn, told BBC News he supported the plan for a lump sum for farmers based on the grants they would have received if they'd stayed in business. But he warned: ""The government have got to make it easy enough for people to take up the scheme - not drown them in bureaucracy. ""The payments on their own won't be enough - but when you tie in other factors such as selling livestock, some farmers will want to take it up. ""For people on larger holdings, it won't be very attractive - but a lot of owner-occupiers might find it attractive."" At the launch of today's consultation, Mr Eustice explained: ""We need to address the twin challenges of helping new entrants fulfil their dream and gain access to land, while also helping an older generation retire with dignity. ""Our exit scheme will offer farmers real incentive to confront what can often be a difficult decision and will help them clear bills and settle debts."" A spokesperson for the National Farmers' Union (NFU) said: ""As our agricultural support is overhauled, farm businesses across the country will be making life-changing decisions about the future of their farm."" They added: ""We want to see a fair transition which allows farmers who are considering leaving the industry to have sufficient time and information to make those life-changing decisions."" About Â£3bn of state subsidy is paid to UK farmers each year, but this will be phased out. An estimated 61% of farm income comes from subsidy. Under the new post-Brexit scheme, grants will be used to incentivise so-called ""public goods"", such as protecting water supplies; holding floodwater on land; capturing carbon in soil and trees, and increasing wildlife. The government believes that younger farmers will be more open to new nature-friendly ideas and more inclined to seek income by diversifying into businesses such as camping or glamping. Clarification 8th March 2022: This article was amended on the day of publication to make clear that the scheme is for older farmers in England and that farmers in Wales are expected to be able to benefit from a similar scheme, while plans in Scotland and Northern Ireland will be different.

"The pandemic has placed a huge strain on the NHS The government did not plan enough for a threat on the scale of coronavirus, its spending watchdog has found. The National Audit Office also urged ministers to come up with ideas to prevent widening inequality caused by the pandemic. But it said they had enjoyed some success in their efforts to deal with the crisis, on which Â£372bn had been spent by March this year. The government said it had acted ""quickly and decisively"" throughout. Almost 127,700 people diagnosed with coronavirus have died in the UK, but more than 38.6 million people have received their first vaccination jab since the programme began in December. Nothing conclusive on changing roadmap, says PM Ministers urge vaccine take-up amid variant fears When coronavirus struck in early spring last year, the government lacked plans for many areas of its response in England, including identifying who needed to shield and managing mass disruption to schooling, the NAO said. It added that there had been problems setting up employment support schemes, for which as many as 2.9 million people were not eligible. The report said: ""While the response to the pandemic has provided new learning from both what has worked well and what has not worked well, it has also laid bare existing fault lines within society, such as the risk of widening inequalities, and within public service delivery and government itself."" The government has said it will review the report's recommendations closely and build on its commitment to data transparency and accountability. The criticism comes as Dominic Cummings, former adviser to Prime Minister Boris Johnson, saidthe government's pandemic planning had been ""part disaster, part non-existent""and said ""secrecy contributed greatly to the catastrophe"". Ahead of his appearance before a committee of MPs next week, he said the lack of public scrutiny is still affecting the response to the rise of new variants, such as the B.1.617.2 variant first identified in India, as the UK rolls out vaccinations and takes major steps towards ending coronavirus restrictions. The NAO said in its report that communications had not always been clear and timely, stating that guidance on personal protective equipment (PPE) changed 30 times up to the end of last July. And the report said there had not always been a clear audit trail to support decisions to award PPE contracts. The NAO also warned that the hundreds of billions of pounds spent in response to the pandemic so far may have an impact on the longer-term sustainability of the public finances. UK government borrowing hit Â£303bn in the financial year 2020-21 - the highest amount, as a proportion of national income, since 1946. NAO head Gareth Davies said: ""Covid-19 has required government to respond to an exceptionally challenging and rapidly changing threat. ""There is much to learn from the successes and failures in government's response."" Lessons learned were ""not only important for the remaining phases of the current pandemic, but should also help better prepare the UK for future emergencies"", Mr Davies said. In response, the government said its approach throughout the pandemic had been ""guided by data and the advice of scientific and medical experts"". It said its public health response had brought together Public Health England, the Joint Biosecurity Centre and NHS Test and Trace under one leadership to increase capacity needed to handle a full-blown pandemic. ""As new evidence emerged, we acted quickly and decisively to protect lives and livelihoods,"" a spokesperson said.

""We are now actively investigating the Trump Organization in a criminal capacity, along with the Manhattan DA. We have no additional comment."" The offices of the state attorney general and city district attorney are separate and, according to National Public Radio (NPR), have historically been rivals. The fact that they are now co-ordinating their efforts underscores the high profile of their investigation. The two prosecutors are combing through millions of pages of financial information in a search for evidence, reports NPR. The statement did not say what turned the inquiry from civil to criminal in nature, or whether the former president himself might be personally implicated in any allegations. Mr Trump accused Ms James and District Attorney Cyrus Vance, both Democrats, of being ""possessed"" by their political vendettas against him. A statement from his office rebuked the investigation as ""a continuation of the greatest political Witch Hunt in the history of the United States"". ""After prosecutorial efforts the likes of which nobody has ever seen before, they failed to stop me in Washington, so they turned it over to New York to do their dirty work. This is what I have been going through for years,"" he wrote. The former president's eldest son, Donald Trump Jr, condemned the inquiry as ""flagrant abuse of political office"". On Twitter, he shared an old video of Ms James promising to pursue all legal options against Mr Trump while she was still campaigning for the attorney general role. The video drew fiery comments from other top Trump allies, like senior advisor Stephen Miller, who said the US system of law was being turned into ""a weapon of vengeance not an instrument of justice"". Civil cases usually have to do with injury to individuals or other private parties, including businesses; criminal law applies in cases where the damage is thought to affect society at large, including the state. Six legal battles looming for Trump Ms James launched a civil inquiry in March 2019 into claims that Mr Trump had inflated the value of his assets to banks when seeking loans, and understated them to lower his taxes. Her office has also been seeking documents on four Trump Organization properties in Manhattan, upstate New York, Chicago and Los Angeles. Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr said in court documents last August that his office was investigating alleged ""protracted criminal conduct"" at the Trump Organization. Mr Vance's legal filing cited newspaper articles about purported bank and insurance fraud at the company. The Manhattan district attorney has also been investigating whether any of Mr Trump's financial records were doctored to cover up hush-money payments to two women in 2016 who say they had affairs with him. Mr Vance's office said in February it had obtained Mr Trump's tax returns as part of the investigation, after a long legal battle. Throughout his presidency, Mr Trump resolutely refused to reveal his tax returns, despite coming under great pressure to do so. Allen Weisselberg, the chief financial officer of the Trump Organization, and members of his family have been the focus of the investigators. The clock is ticking. Mr Vance leaves office in December, and he would be expected file any criminal complaint by the end of the year. Will Grant, BBC News, Washington DC Throughout his time in office, Donald Trump dismissed any probe into his financial dealings or those of his organisation as a politically-motivated ""witch hunt"" led by Democrats desperate to see him forced from power. Yet now that he no longer enjoys protection from prosecution, this latest development will trouble him. That a former US president is facing not one but two criminal investigations is a significant development, one which could have repercussions for his political future. The New York State Attorney General, Letitia James, clearly believes that there is enough at play to warrant moving the investigation from a civil to a criminal one. When combined with the ongoing examination of the former president's tax returns by the Manhattan District Attorney, Cy Vance, Mr Trump is looking at a complex and tangled legal battle ahead â one which he remains adamant he shouldn't have to face but which he now almost certainly cannot avoid.

"Israeli PM Netanyahu says he is ""determined to carry on"" with the military operation in Gaza until ""calm and security are restored"" Earlier US President Biden told Netanyahu he expected a ""significant de-escalation"" on Wednesday Israel shells targets in Lebanon after four rockets were fired towards Israel from Lebanese territory Efforts to broker a truce between Israel and Palestinian militants continue, but little progress appears to have been made âThe operation is continuing at full throttle. There is still no ceasefire on the table,â Israeli defence sources tell the BBC Hamas officials, meanwhile, say ceasefire efforts ""are serious and continuingâ but Palestinian demands must be met New Israeli air strikes hit Gaza overnight as fighting entered a 10th day At least two militants were killed in strikes on apartment buildings in the territory Barrages of rockets were also fired into Israel, with Hamas saying it targeted an air base in the south Edited by Alix Kroeger This image shows rockets launched from Gaza towards Israel in a photo captured by an Israeli naval boat while patrolling in the Mediterranean Sea We're now pausing our live coverage of the ongoing Israel-Gaza conflict - many thanks for staying with us. To recap, here are the key developments from the past 24 hours:  Contributing to today's live page were David Gritten, Joshua Cheetham, Yaroslav Lukov, Gareth Evans, Thomas Spender, Alix Kroeger, Joshua Nevett and Mal Siret The conflict has inflicted a heavy human toll At least 227 people have been killed in Gaza since fighting between Israel and Palestinian militants in the enclave began, according to health officials. Gaza's health ministry said 64 children, 38  women, and 17 elderly people were among the dead, while 1,620 people were wounded. Israel's military says it has killed more than 100 Palestinian militants in Gaza. Hamas, the Palestinian militant group that runs the territory, does not give casualty figures for fighters. In Israel at least 12 people, including two children, have been killed, its medical authorities say. The violence in Gaza and Israel is the worst since 2014. Despite the best efforts of world leaders, there is currently no sign of a ceasefire. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (C) is among the Democratic lawmakers who backed the resolution Democratic lawmakers in the US have launched a last-minute push to block the sale of weapons to Israel as they call for a ceasefire in Gaza. Several progressive lawmakers in the Democratic-controlled House of Representatives have backed a resolution to stop the $735m (Â£520m) sale. But the resolution is expected to fail, because Democratic leaders in the legislative chamber have expressed support for the sale. The resolution is seen as a symbolic move to put pressure on US President Joe Biden, who told Israel's prime minister to move towards de-escalation earlier today. As the conflict has intensified, Biden has been confronted with growing disquiet among Democratic and Republican lawmakers over his position towards Israel. On the Democratic side, members of Congress have become more critical of Israel as they express concern for human rights in Gaza. Meanwhile, Republicans have accused Biden of not offering enough support to Israel in the face of rocket attacks by Palestinian militants. Israel's military conducts a strike near the border between Israel and the Gaza strip Israel's army says it has targeted the head of Hamas's military wing, Mohammed Deif, during the ongoing strikes on Gaza. A spokesman for the Israel Defense Forces (IDF), Brig Gen Hidai Zilberman, said Israel had tried to assassinate Deif, the head of the Izzedine al-Qassam Brigades. Deif, who has been on the Israeli army's most-wanted list for over two decades, has survived repeated attempts on his life over the years,including in the last major conflict in 2014. Israeli news website Ynet reported that in one of the operations, Deif had been in his bunker when Israel hit the location. He tends to stay in the background and his whereabouts remain unknown. Hamas has not confirmed the reports. A United Nations relief agency has been delivering aid to Gaza Israel has accused a United Nations relief agency of ""cynical misrepresentation"" for suggesting it was preventing humanitarian aid from entering the Gaza Strip. On Tuesday the aid agency for Palestinians, known as UNRWA,called on Israel to enable access to Gaza for humanitarian supplies and its staff.,external The agency said Israel had not approved such access and was therefore failing to meet its obligations under international law. But Israel's foreign ministry denied this in a statement on Wednesday. It said rocket fire from Palestinian militants in Gaza, not Israel, had halted the transfer of humanitarian aid on Tuesday and Wednesday. âUNRWAâs claim that Israel is preventing humanitarian aid from reaching Gaza is a cynical misrepresentation and simply a lie,â the statement said. ""Israel will continue its efforts to co-ordinate the transfer of humanitarian aid into Gaza, taking into account security considerations.â As the fighting enters its 10th day, and air strikes and rocket fire continue, let's take a look at what triggered the latest violence. It was sparked by days of escalating clashes between Palestinians and Israeli police at a holy hilltop compound in East Jerusalem earlier this month. The site is revered by both Muslims, who call it the Haram al-Sharif (Noble Sanctuary), and Jews, for whom it is known as the Temple Mount. Hamas demanded Israel remove police from there and the nearby predominantly Arab district of Sheikh Jarrah, where Palestinian families face eviction by Jewish settlers. Hamas launched rockets when its ultimatum went unheeded. Palestinian anger was further fuelled by Israel's annual celebration of its capture of East Jerusalem in the 1967 Middle East war, known as Jerusalem Day. The fate of the city, with its deep religious and national significance to both sides, lies at the heart of the decades-old Israel-Palestinian conflict. Prime Minister Boris Johnson vowed to root out anti-Semitism in the UK Now let's turn to the UK, where Prime Minister Boris Johnson has condemned a spike in anti-Semitic incidents in the country since the Israel-Gaza conflict began. Johnson was asked what he would do to support Jewish communities in the UK during questioning by opposition leader Sir Keir Starmer in parliament. ""I share his horror at the outbreak of anti-Semitic incidents and the government has conveyed that message loud and clear to those who are responsible for enforcing the law against hate crime,"" Johnson said. He said anti-Semitism must be called out ""at every stage"", adding: ""We will not let it take root, we will not allow it to grow and fester."" His comments came after 116 anti-Semitic incidents were reported over 11 days from 8 May in the UK - a five-fold increase on the previous period. Those incidents were recorded by the Community Security Trust (CST), which offers safety advice to the Jewish community in the UK. Recent incidents dealt with by the police includean attack on Rabbi Rafi Goodwin near his synagogue in north London. Hossein Salami says Palestinians have emerged as a ""missile-equipped nation"" The head of Iran's Islamic Revolution Guard Corps (IRGC) has said that Iran backs the Palestinians against what it calls the ""Zionist regime"" (Israel). In a televised address, Hossein Salami said the conflict showed that ""Palestinians have emerged as a missile-equipped nation."" Iran is a major supporter of Hamas, which it backs financially and militarily. The two sides fell out after Hamas refused to support Iran's ally, Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, in Syria's civil war. But the two sides have since reconciled. An escalation of fighting between Israelis and Palestinians has led the United Nations to warn of a ""full-scale war"". The latest violence followed weeks of rising tensions in Jerusalem, though the conflict has gone on for decades. Here's our explainer, looking at the key issues. The Israeli military has continued to carry out air strikes in Gaza in response to rocket fire from Palestinian militants Following news of Joe Biden's call for a ""de-escalation"", a Hamas spokesman in Gaza, Hazem Qassem, has told reporters that Israel has been refusing to engage with diplomatic efforts to end the violence. ""There are no specific dates for the issue of the ceasefire, because all the international efforts that are being made, as well as the Egyptian efforts, are met with an Israeli position that refuses to deal with ceasefire initiatives,"" he said. He told Reuters news agency that if Israel ended its ""bombardment on Gaza... there can be room to talk about
arrangements to restore calm"". Netanyahu has reaffirmed his commitment to Israeli strikes on Palestinian militants in Gaza Israeli's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has vowed to continue his government's operation against Palestinian militantsin a video statement posted to Twitter a short time ago,external. His comments came shortly after a phone call with US President Joe Biden, who told him to move towards de-escalation. While Netanyahu did not comment on the call, he said he appreciated Bidenâs support of Israelâs right to defend itself. However, he added: ""I am determined to continue this operation until its goal is achieved - to bring back peace and security to you, the citizens of Israel."" Diplomatic calls for a ceasefire have so far proved fruitless. BBC OS Two Israeli Arabs have told the BBC about their experiences of living in Israel since the fighting began Each day this week, we've been speaking to the different communities affected by the Israel-Gaza conflict. On Wednesday, we heard from friends Khadija and Adrieh, two Israeli Arab women.. Israeli Arabs are people who live in Israel but strongly identify with Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank. Both young mums, Khadija and Adrieh grew up together in Jaffa, a city with mixed communities of people with Palestinian and Jewish backgrounds. Since the fighting began, there have been flare-ups of intercommunal violence between Israeli Arabs and Jews across Israel. Khadija told the BBC she was afraid to go out and live her life as usual. ""Itâs not new to be afraid to be an Arab woman here in Israel, but itâs very new to me to be afraid to walk in my neighbourhood,"" she said. ""If you canât feel safe in your country, you canât feel like you belong to this country."" You can hear more from Khadija and Adrieh bylistening to BBC OS programme on World Service radio. The US has again said it will not back a French-proposed UN Security Council draft resolution calling for a ceasefire, stressing that it could undermine efforts to de-escalate the crisis, the AFP news agency reports. ""We've been clear and consistent that we are focused on intensive diplomatic efforts under way to bring an end to the violence and that we will not support actions that we believe undermine efforts to de-escalate,"" a US spokesperson at the UN told the news agency. The US is one of the five permanent UN Security Council members with a veto power. Earlier on Wednesday, US President Joe Biden told Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu in a phone conversation that he expected ""a significant de-escalation today on the path to a ceasefire"". This video can not be played MSF: Violence is curbing healthcare access in Gaza Dr Natalie Thurtle from medical NGO Doctors Without Borders (MSF) has been telling the BBC how her organisation has been struggling to provide medical care on the ground amid the continuing violence. âThe border to Gaza is closed and no humanitarian corridor has been negotiated,â she said, calling for an end to the fighting. Palestinians in Gaza, meanwhile, are ""frightened, their children are frightened, they are hiding in the basement every night"", she says. Barbara Plett UsherBBC News, Wilmington This is the first time that US President Joe Biden has directly and publicly pressed Israel for a ceasefire - or spoken with such urgency. Until now, he had been stressing Israelâs right to defend itself and insisting that Hamas stop its rocket fire. Today he told Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that this has to be the beginning of the end, to significantly wind down the Israeli operation on the way to a ceasefire. He linked his comments to what he said was progress in degrading Hamas' capabilities, and to the state of affairs in Gaza, which is facing a deepening humanitarian crisis. There's been increasing political and international pressure on Mr Biden to intervene more forcefully to push for an end to the violence. With another UN Security Council meeting set for tomorrow, he seems to be indicating that the US is becoming less willing to give Israel diplomatic cover. An area in the city of Shfaram in northern Israel is cordoned off after rockets were fired from Lebanon If you're just joining our coverage of the renewed fighting between Israel and Palestinian militants, here are the latest developments: Nine-year-old Yara (left) and five-year-old Rula (right) were killed alongside several family members on Sunday Of the 219 people killed in Gaza at least 63 are children, according to its health ministry, while of the 10 people killed in Israel, two children are among the dead, the country's medical service says. Among the children killed in Gaza were sisters Yara, 9, and Rula, 5 from the al-Kawalek family. Both had been receiving treatment for trauma from the Norwegian Refugee Council (NRC). The al-Kawaleks were polite girls who always did their homework on time, one of their teachers, who did not want be named, told the BBC. Ido Avigal, five, who was killed in a Hamas rocket attack The youngest victim on the Israeli side is thought to be Ido Avigal, a five-year-old boy killed last Wednesday in the southern town of Sderot. Ido was killed inside a fortified room in what the Israeli military described as an ""incredibly rare"" incident. Rocket shrapnel pierced the protective metal plating used to cover the window of the room he was in, also injuring his mother and seven-year-old sister. He died of his injuries hours later. Ibrahim al-Masry was playing with his siblings in the front yard of their home in a northern neighbourhood of Gaza last week, when a strike hit, according to reports. ""We were laughing and having fun, when suddenly they began to bomb us, everything around us caught fire,"" his brothertold the AFP news agency,external. You can read more about the children who have died in the fightinghere. This video can not be played John Dugard: US not an honest broker in Israel-Gaza conflict John Dugard, a former United Nations Special Rapporteur to the UNHCR, has told the BBC that he believes the US is ""not an honest broker"" in the Israel-Gaza conflict. ""First of all there's the evidence provided by the failure of United States to support a [UN Security Council] resolution at this stage,"" Mr Dugard said. ""Secondly there's the fact that the US continues to operate its embassy from Jerusalem, which is contrary to international law."" The US has called for a ceasefire, but it has been blocking attempts by the UN Security Council to issue a joint statement, saying this would not help with the de-escalation of hostilities. We reported yesterday that two men from Thailand working at a packaging factory in southern Israel had been killed by Palestinian rocket-fire. The two men, who were employed at the Obad farming estate in Eshkol town, have been named as Sikharin Sangamram, 24, and Weerawat Karanborirak, 44. Israel's Kan News tweeted images of the two men.

At least eight other Thai workers were wounded in yesterday's rocket attack, Thailand's foreign ministry said. It's not unusual for citizens of Thailand to seek work in Israel, and the two countries have a good relationship. A senior Thai diplomat in Israel told the BBC that around 4,000 of the country's citizens had been working in southern Israel when the latest conflict erupted, but that some were relocated to safer areas over the weekend. Paul AdamsBBC diplomatic correspondent, Jerusalem As we reported earlier, US President Joe Biden spoke to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on the phone, telling him he expected a ""significant de-escalation today"". The tone of that call suggests the US is losing patience with Israelâs military attacks. With another UN Security Council meeting looming on Thursday, the White House is indicating that it may be less willing to offer diplomatic cover to Israel, one of its closest allies. Speaking to foreign ambassadors this morning, Netanyahu said it was not possible to set a timeframe on the operation in Gaza. Last night, local reports in Israel suggested a ceasefire could be announced as early as Thursday morning. But these reports have not been confirmed. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Damage from an Israeli air strike overnight in Gaza City US President Joe Biden has told Israel's PM Benjamin Netanyahu he expects a ""significant de-escalation"" in the Gaza conflict on Wednesday. Mr Biden wanted a ""path to ceasefire"", the White House said. The US is a staunch ally of Israel and has so far opposed a joint UN Security Council statement on the conflict. In response Mr Netanyahu said he was ""determined to carry on"" until ""calm and security are restored to Israeli citizens"", according to Israeli media. The conflict is in its 10th day, with a continuing exchange of rocket fire from Palestinian militants into Israel and Israeli air strikes on Gaza. On Wednesday, four rockets were also fired from Lebanon into Israel and Israel's military responded by firing artillery shells at ""a number of targets in Lebanese territory"". It was not immediately clear whether this would prove to be a significant escalation. The Israel-Palestinian conflict explained The children who have died in the conflict The Gaza fighting began after weeks of rising Israeli-Palestinian tension in occupied East Jerusalem that culminated in clashes at a holy site revered by both Muslims and Jews. Hamas, which controls Gaza, began firing rockets after warning Israel to withdraw from the site, triggering retaliatory air strikes. At least 227 people, including more than 100 women and children, have been killed in Gaza so far, according to its health ministry. Israel has said at least 150 militants are among those killed in Gaza. Hamas does not give casualty figures for fighters. In Israel 12 people, including two children, have been killed, its medical service says. Israel says some 4,000 rockets have been fired towards its territory by militants in Gaza. On Wednesday morning, Mr Biden held his fourth call with Mr Netanyahu since the conflict started. A statement released by the White House,externalsaid: ""The president conveyed to the prime minister that he expected a significant de-escalation today on the path to a ceasefire."" This video can not be played Ex-UN rapporteur John Dugard: US is not honest broker in Israel-Gaza conflict The US has called before for a truce but has held up any joint UN statement, saying it would not help with de-escalation. The Palestinian representative at the UN, Riyad Mansour, called the Security Council's failure to express a unified position ""shameful"". The latest bid for a council resolution calling for a ceasefire, launched by France, failed on Wednesday when the US said it could ""undermine efforts to de-escalate"". A major foreign policy headache for Biden What the law says about the fighting One Israeli military source told Reuters that Israel was assessing whether conditions were right for a truce. The Ynet news website said that the Israelis were talking with Egyptian mediators. It quoted sources in the Israeli cabinet as saying Israel could achieve its objectives and end the fighting ""within days"". A Hamas leader said that efforts by mediators were ""serious and continuous"" but that Palestinian demands had to be met. Earlier on Wednesday Mr Netanyahu did not appear ready to begin a truce. He said there were ""only two ways that you can deal with"" Hamas. ""You can either conquer them, and that's always an open possibility, or you can deter them, and we are engaged right now in forceful deterrence, but I have to say we don't rule out anything."" The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said there had been renewed rocket fire from Gaza on Wednesday and that its fighter jets had attacked military infrastructure, including tunnels, and the homes of Hamas commanders. The BBC's Rushdi Abualouf in Gaza said two Palestinian militants were killed in Gaza City, as dozens of strikes targeted both it and the southern city of Khan Younis. Israel's Iron Dome anti-missile system intercepted Palestinian rockets throughout the night Gaza City mother of seven Randa Abu Sultan, 45, told AFP news agency: ""My four-year-old son tells me he's scared that if he falls asleep, he'll wake up to find us dead."" IDF spokesman Brig Gen Hidai Zilberman said Israel had tried to assassinate Mohammed Deif, the head of Hamas's military wing, the Izzedine al-Qassam Brigades. Mohammed Deif has survived repeated attempts on his life,including in the last major conflict in 2014. He tends to stay in the background and his whereabouts remain unknown. Sirens sounded across much of south and central Israel on Wednesday. Hamas also targeted an Israeli air base overnight but the IDF said no bases were hit. Israel defends Gaza strategy as death toll mounts Why is Gaza blurry on Google Maps? Of the 3,750 rockets fired from the Gaza Strip since the fighting began, 550 have fallen short in Gaza, according to the IDF. Israel's Iron Dome missile defence system has intercepted about 90% of the rockets that have crossed into Israeli territory, it says. The IDF estimated that at the start of the conflict, Hamas and Islamic Jihad, the two main groups in Gaza, had an arsenal of about 12,000 rockets or mortars. Mr Netanyahu said the Israeli operation had ""set Hamas back by many years"". There has also been unrest within Israel and in the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem, where Palestinians took part in a general strike on Tuesday. There were clashes in several locations. The party of Turkish President Erdogan rejected US accusations of anti-Semitism Separately on Wednesday, Turkey rejected US accusations that President Recep Tayyip Erdogan had made anti-Semitic remarks about Israel. He had accused Israel of ""terrorism"" against the Palestinians and recently said: ""It is in their nature"". State department spokesman Ned Price said the US found the remarks ""reprehensible"". Omer Celik, a spokesman for Mr Erdogan's party, said the president had given very strong messages against anti-Semitism, adding: ""Accusing our president of anti-Semitism is an illogical and untrue approach. This is a lie."" The worst violence in years between Israel and the Palestinian territory of the Gaza Strip has seen dozens killed. It follows a month of spiralling tensions before open conflict broke out. Here is what happened in the lead-up to the fighting. 13 April Clashes erupt in East Jerusalem between Palestinians and Israeli police. Palestinians are angry over barriers which had been placed outside the Damascus Gate entrance to the Jerusalem‘s Old City preventing them from gathering there after prayers at the Old City’s al-Aqsa Mosque on what is the first night of the Islamic holy month of Ramadan. Palestinian discontent had been stoked earlier in the day when President Mahmoud Abbas called off planned elections, implicitly blaming Israel over voting arrangements for Palestinians in East Jerusalem. Hamas - Mr Abbas' Islamist rivals who control Gaza and were running in the elections - react angrily to the postponement. Violence around Damascus Gate and elsewhere in East Jerusalem continues nightly. 15-16 April Rockets are fired from Gaza at Israel, which responds with air strikes after a relative period of calm between Israel and the Palestinian enclave. 19 April Clashes spread to the mixed Arab-Jewish port city of Jaffa, next to Tel Aviv. 20 April In Jerusalem, Jewish youths, angry over a spate of filmed assaults by Palestinians on Orthodox Jews posted on the TikTok video-sharing app, attack Arabs and chant anti-Arab slogans. 23 April Hundreds of ultra-nationalist Jews shouting “Death to Arabs” march towards Damascus Gate in protest at the Arab assaults on Jews. Clashes erupt at the site between Palestinians and police trying to separate the two groups, injuring dozens of people. Violence between Arabs and Jews spreads to other parts of the city. 24 April Militants fire dozens of rockets at Israel from Gaza, drawing retaliatory air strikes. 2 May President Abbas' Fatah faction and Hamas condemn the looming threatened eviction of Palestinian families from their homes in the Sheikh Jarrah district of East Jerusalem by Jewish settlers ahead of a planned court hearing. Hamas calls on Arabs to form “human shields of resistance” there. In the days that follow, police and protesters repeatedly clash at the site as it becomes a focal point for Palestinian anger. 4 May Militants in Gaza begin sending incendiary balloons into Israel over successive days, causing dozens of fires. 7 May Two Palestinian gunmen are shot dead and a third is wounded after opening fire on Israeli security forces in the northern West Bank. Israeli authorities say the group planned to carry out a “major attack” in Israel. Later on after Friday prayers - the last of Ramadan - major clashes erupt at the al-Aqsa mosque compound, injuring more than 200 people. Israel's police force says it used “riot dispersal means”, firing rubber bullets and stun grenades after officers came under a hail of stones and bottles. 8 May A second night of violence erupts in East Jerusalem after tens of thousands of worshippers prayed at the al-Aqsa mosque for Laylat al-Qadr, the holiest night of Ramadan. Police and protesters clash at Damascus Gate, with police using water cannon, rubber bullets and tear gas against crowds of Palestinians, some throwing stones. More than 120 Palestinians and some 17 police are injured. 9 May Israel's Supreme Court postpones the hearing on the Sheikh Jarrah case following calls to delay it because of the growing unrest. Tensions remain high though and more clashes take place between Israeli police and Palestinians in Sheikh Jarrah and at Damascus Gate. 10 May Early morning clashes break out between police and Palestinians at the al-Aqsa mosque compound, where crowds throw stones and officers fire stun grenades. Palestinian anger has been inflamed by an annual Jerusalem Day march planned for later in the day by hundreds of Israeli nationalists to celebrate Israel's capture of East Jerusalem in 1967. The march is due to pass through predominantly Arab parts of the Old City in what is seen by Palestinians as a deliberate provocation. It is rerouted at the 11th hour, but the atmosphere remains volatile with more than 300 Palestinians and some 21 police injured in the violence at the holy site. Hamas issues an ultimatum to Israel to “withdraw its soldiers... from the blessed al-Aqsa mosque and Sheikh Jarrah” by 18:00. When the deadline passes without an Israeli response, rockets are fired towards Jerusalem for the first time in years. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says the group has “crossed a red line” and Israel retaliates with air strikes, killing three Hamas fighters. A continuing exchange of rocket-fire and air strikes quickly escalates into the fiercest hostilities between the two sides since they fought a war in 2014.

"The government has no plan to meet the ""huge challenge"" of persuading motorists to switch to electric vehicles, MPs have warned. The Public Accounts Committee said the official target of banning the sale of new petrol and diesel cars from 2030 could be missed without urgent action.

Road and rail building plans under review Sales of electric vehicles are by far the fastest growing segment of the car market, but they still only account for only 11% of new registrations. The committee warned that this would not get to 100% unless prices fell and charging infrastructure was installed quickly. Only 13 electric car models on sale in the UK at the moment cost less than Â£30,000, its report said. It pointed out that the majority of charging took place at home and claimed the government had not focused enough on helping people who do not have off-street parking. The committee also said the government needed to develop the skilled workforce and electric power infrastructure needed to support the transition. Its chairwoman, Labour MP Meg Hillier, said the UK had ""a mountain to climb"" to meet its targets. Challenges included making the car industry ""environmentally and socially compliant"", but getting the government ""wean itself off carbon revenues"" could be the biggest obstacle, she added. ""What we've got is a government throwing up a few signs around base camp, and no let-up in demand for oversized, petrol-guzzling vehicles,"" Ms Hillier said. But the government said it had a ""highly ambitious and world-leading approach to increasing the uptake of zero-emission cars"". A spokesperson said the ""progress we're making in this area will help us to meet our targets"". The government had allocated Â£1.3bn over the next four years to support the roll-out of charging points on motorways and major A roads, in homes and businesses and on streets, they added. The cost of electric vehicles would fall as production scaled up around the world, the spokesperson claimed. The RAC motoring group said it expected sales to grow further as new models came out. It called for the government to look at ""ways to incentivise take-up"", adding that the plug-in grant - under which motorists are given help in purchasing zero-emissions vehicles - was not guaranteed to continue beyond 2023. Sales of new hybrid vehicles are to be banned from 2035, under government plans.

"The pandemic has placed a huge strain on the NHS The government did not plan enough for a threat on the scale of coronavirus, its spending watchdog has found. The National Audit Office also urged ministers to come up with ideas to prevent widening inequality caused by the pandemic. But it said they had enjoyed some success in their efforts to deal with the crisis, on which Â£372bn had been spent by March this year. The government said it had acted ""quickly and decisively"" throughout. Almost 127,700 people diagnosed with coronavirus have died in the UK, but more than 38.6 million people have received their first vaccination jab since the programme began in December. Nothing conclusive on changing roadmap, says PM Ministers urge vaccine take-up amid variant fears When coronavirus struck in early spring last year, the government lacked plans for many areas of its response in England, including identifying who needed to shield and managing mass disruption to schooling, the NAO said. It added that there had been problems setting up employment support schemes, for which as many as 2.9 million people were not eligible. The report said: ""While the response to the pandemic has provided new learning from both what has worked well and what has not worked well, it has also laid bare existing fault lines within society, such as the risk of widening inequalities, and within public service delivery and government itself."" The government has said it will review the report's recommendations closely and build on its commitment to data transparency and accountability. The criticism comes as Dominic Cummings, former adviser to Prime Minister Boris Johnson, saidthe government's pandemic planning had been ""part disaster, part non-existent""and said ""secrecy contributed greatly to the catastrophe"". Ahead of his appearance before a committee of MPs next week, he said the lack of public scrutiny is still affecting the response to the rise of new variants, such as the B.1.617.2 variant first identified in India, as the UK rolls out vaccinations and takes major steps towards ending coronavirus restrictions. The NAO said in its report that communications had not always been clear and timely, stating that guidance on personal protective equipment (PPE) changed 30 times up to the end of last July. And the report said there had not always been a clear audit trail to support decisions to award PPE contracts. The NAO also warned that the hundreds of billions of pounds spent in response to the pandemic so far may have an impact on the longer-term sustainability of the public finances. UK government borrowing hit Â£303bn in the financial year 2020-21 - the highest amount, as a proportion of national income, since 1946. NAO head Gareth Davies said: ""Covid-19 has required government to respond to an exceptionally challenging and rapidly changing threat. ""There is much to learn from the successes and failures in government's response."" Lessons learned were ""not only important for the remaining phases of the current pandemic, but should also help better prepare the UK for future emergencies"", Mr Davies said. In response, the government said its approach throughout the pandemic had been ""guided by data and the advice of scientific and medical experts"". It said its public health response had brought together Public Health England, the Joint Biosecurity Centre and NHS Test and Trace under one leadership to increase capacity needed to handle a full-blown pandemic. ""As new evidence emerged, we acted quickly and decisively to protect lives and livelihoods,"" a spokesperson said.

"Politicians have been discussing whether 60 members is enough for decades Calls to expand the Senedd have been endorsed by the first minister, who says there is a ""significant tide"" across Cardiff Bay parties in favour. Mark Drakeford said there was ""growing enthusiasm"" for a Welsh Parliament ""fit to discharge its responsibilities"". Last year, a report by Labour and Plaid members on a Senedd committee concluded the institution should expand toup to 90 politicians, from the current 60. The committee was boycotted by the Conservatives and the Brexit Party. Increasing the Senedd to 90 members would make it the same size as the Northern Ireland Assembly. The Scottish Parliament has 129 MSPs. First woman of colour elected to Welsh Parliament First day of work for new Senedd members 'I always vote - this year I didn't' Both Plaid Cymru and the Liberal Democrats back having a bigger Senedd, but want that to be accompanied by changes to the electoral system to better reflect the share of the vote parties receive. However, the Tories say the new Welsh Parliament should focus ""solely on Wales' recovery from coronavirus"", not creating more Cardiff Bay politicians. Any changes would require the backing of at least 40 Senedd members, a so-called ""super majority"". It has been estimated an additional 30 Senedd members wouldcost around an extra Â£12m per year. Welsh Labour leader Mr Drakeford was talking to BBC Wales ahead of the parliament meeting on Wednesday for its first session since he wasrenominated as first minister, after his party matched its best previous election performances and won 30 seats on 6 May. Plaid Cymru was the only large party to officially back last September's electoral reform committee report,Senedd reform: the next steps,external. That review also called for a more proportional system to be used at the next Senedd election, due in 2026. Mark Drakeford says he hopeS the Senedd will ""get on with"" working through the issues The report warned that if the changes were to take effect at that election, consensus on them must be established ""very early"" in the new Senedd term. Mr Drakeford said it would be ""for the Labour Party to take a view"" but added: ""I think there is a significant tide across parties in the Senedd to grasp this difficult issue of making the Senedd fit for the responsibilities it now discharges. ""It's a very, very different body to the one that was formed in 1999"", he said, referring to the then Welsh Assembly's lack of primary law-making and tax-raising powers. ""Ivor Richard said in his report,externalin 2003 that the Senedd needed more members to do the job that it's asked to do for Wales,"" he said. ""Now I think we need just to make sure the practicalities of that are properly understood and, if there is a momentum for it, it's not for the government to take this forward, it is for the Senedd itself."" The Senedd's powers are far greater than those of Cardiff Bay politicians 20 years ago The first minister said there was ""an enthusiasm amongst a growing number of members"" for change. Asked if he shared that enthusiasm, Mr Drakeford said: ""Yes, I want to see the Senedd properly fit to discharge its responsibilities."" He said the chances of a bigger Senedd at the next poll ""have improved as a result of the election, and it's a matter not just of numbers but it's a matter of method of election as well, which is a thorny issue, on which there are many views"". ""So there are still significant practical issues to work through. I hope the Senedd will get on with it."" Andrew RT Davies says politicians should be focusing their energies elsewhere The Conservatives won 16 seats at this month's election, their highest total, havingpledged not to expand the Welsh Parliament. Responding to the first minister's comments, Tory Senedd leader Andrew RT Davies said Mr Drakeford was ""badly mistaken"" in his views as ""only Labour and Plaid Cymru have an appetite to create more politicians in Cardiff Bay"". ""Welsh Conservatives have been clear that this parliamentary term should be focused solely on Wales' recovery from coronavirus, not increasing the size of the Senedd,"" he said. ""It's regrettable that just a couple weeks after polling day this is featuring on the political agenda when all energies should be directed at saving jobs, tackling waiting lists and ensuring our children catch up on their missed education over the past year."" Adam Price says it has long been known that the Senedd is too small Plaid Cymru took 13 Senedd seats in May's poll, which combined with the 30 Labour politicians in the chamber would reach the 40 seat threshold needed to expand the parliament. Plaid leader Adam Price said: ""We've long known that the Senedd is currently too small to fulfil its role of holding the government of the day to account. ""Plaid Cymru supports delivering the democratic representation Wales deserves - and needs - and ensuring that our Senedd and wider democracy reflects our modern nation in all its diversity along with all the voices and aspirations of Wales' citizens. ""That means urgently demanding more powers to a larger and stronger Senedd and implementing a fairer voting system in the form ofSTV,external."" Jane Dodds says she is encouraged by the first minister's words The Welsh Liberal Democrats have just one seat in Cardiff Bay, as they did after the 2016 poll, now held by their leader Jane Dodds, who called Mr Drakeford's comments ""encouraging"". ""Welsh Liberal Democrats are prepared to work with other parties in order to increase the number of Senedd Members by 20-30 in line with the 2017 McAllister Review,"" she said. ""This option should be made cost neutral by the planned reduction in the number of Westminster MPs by the UK government."" ""Any change to the number of MSs [members of the Senedd] should also go hand in hand with the introduction of a proportional voting system for Senedd elections, to make sure that every vote counts and every member elected is elected by the majority of voters."" Jess Blair, director of the Electoral Reform Society Cymru, said the comments ""represent a big step forward to address the democratic deficit in Wales"". ""In the two decades since devolution the powers and responsibilities in Cardiff Bay have grown, yet the size of the Senedd has not, remaining the same size as Pembrokeshire County Council,"" she said. There are two main difficulties with proposals to increase the size of the Senedd. The first is that creating more politicians is hard to sell to voters - but boundary changes for Westminster elections are coming, and bringing with them areduction in the number of Welsh MPs, perhaps this could provide some cover for introducing changes to the Senedd? The second is that it would mean changing the voting system itself - this would be a chance to adopt a fully proportional system for Senedd elections. Some in Welsh Labour are concerned that could undermine their current dominance, and so far the party has been reluctant to commit to change, even though many of their elected Senedd members support it. But after his recent electoral success, Welsh party leader Mark Drakeford has momentum behind him as well as a departure date in front of him. He says he'll stand down during this term - could this be a legacy project? One thing is for sure, if he can get his party on board, Plaid Cymru and Lib Dem support mean the votes are there to get this through.

"This video can not be played Parts of village underwater after flooding People whose properties were badly damaged by flooding after a mine shaft ""blew out"" have said they are in constant fear of another flood. About 80 people were evacuated because of flooding related to mine works in January in Skewen, Neath Port Talbot. Many residents are months away from returning to their homes, while other said trying to get help from the Coal Authority is a ""nightmare."" The Coal Authority said it should have completed its work on site by August. Meanwhile, a campaign led by Aberavon MP Stephen Kinnock is being launched on Thursday to ensure ""not a single victim of the awful flooding in Skewen is left out of pocket"". Coal Authority 'not liable' for mine flood damage Is Wales' coalmining heritage behind flooding? Financial help offered to flood victims Emma Jones, 42, lives on Skewen's worst hit street, Goshen Park, where the blow out happened. ""It feels like an absolute living nightmare. Absolute nightmare,"" she said. ""I think because it was about five months ago, people have forgotten and think 'oh they must be all right now', but we're not, it's continuing."" Firefighters in Skewen waded through water up to their thighs amidst reports of evacuated homes Her two daughters were rescued from the family home by firefighters while she was at work. Initially, she said families like hers who were made homeless overnight were offered lots of support, but feels things have changed. ""We did have a lot of help,"" said Mrs Jones. ""But it seems like that help has really faded now and people are feeling really angry because we are not being given answers, we are not being kept up to date with information of the work that's going on by our houses."" At least 80 people had to leave their homes in Skewen after a mine blow-out caused flooding Asked whether she feels the Coal Authority are helping enough, she said: ""Absolutely not."" ""It would just be nice to know what their plan is for today, tomorrow, next week. Up-to-date information, that's what we would really like to have."" Mrs Jones said there is constant anxiety that homes could flood again due to the damage done to the drainage system in the area. ""When there's heavy rain there's a lot of standing water around here,"" she added. ""Water is managing to get back into people's houses, not a great deal but still, once your house is dry you don't want to see more water getting in, and the thought of it happening again is giving everybody great anxiety."" BBC Wales understands the Coal Authority has had to buy at least one home in order to install a new water management system. Natasha and Karl Jones are locked in a battle with their insurance companies and the Coal Authority Natasha and Karl Jones live with their two children at the bottom of Goshen Park. Mrs Jones, her daughter and the family cat were also rescued by the fire service. The incident has left her seven-year-old ""traumatised"" and having to ""go through counselling"". Although they've recently returned home, the scars remain. ""It's been awful,"" she said. ""Obviously we're living in a building site at the moment because everyone is having so much work done, and we understand that, but every bang you hear you think 'oh my gosh has it happened again?' ""When you hear running water, you think 'has the water come back? It is unsettling."" The family is one of many locked in a battle with their insurance companies and the Coal Authority. Theresa Dalling says she cannot sleep because she is ""waiting for the next thing to happen"" The Authority is not accepting liability for the damage caused by the flood and its Â£500 offer to reinstate ruined gardens was branded ""disgusting"". It has since increased the offer to Â£2,000 but that has been described as ""not on"". ""People just want to go back home,"" Mrs Jones added. ""They just want their homes to be as they were, and why should we be fighting and trying to chase around everyone, just trying to get everything as was?"" ""It's just like living through hell, for us and our neighbours, it's a daily battle trying to get everything sorted. Nothing is easy."" Residents also fear the drainage system is so badly damaged there could be another flood. Theresa Dalling's bungalow on Dynevor Road escaped the water by inches. But since January, water has been seeping through the retaining wall next to her drive, and a large volume of water is constantly gushing through the drain in her back garden, even during dry weather. ""We don't know where it's coming from, we've had no answers,"" she said. they don't know where it's coming from. Welsh Water say it's not theirs, the Coal Authority say it's not theirs, well who's is it then?"" ""It wasn't there before. In the 22 years that we've had this bungalow we've never had water on the drive. Where's it coming from?"" She added her mental health, with which she was already suffering, has deteriorated badly. The Coal Authority said its ""sympathy remains"" with those affected by the flooding on 21 January. ""Whilst the Coal Authority are not liable for the flooding we recognise that it has had a significant impact on many homes and developed the Skewen support policy to offer whatever practical help and support we can within the bounds of the legislation and guidance we have to operate within,"" a spokesman said. ""We have just completed a general clean-up of garden areas and our teams are now scheduling outdoor remediation works with each resident as we agree the full schedule with them. ""We expect that work on site will be completed by the end of August and we have ensured that residents have access to their homes since 6 February 2021 to allow repairs to be undertaken by their insurers in as timely a fashion as possible.""

"Former US President Donald Trump has lashed out after the New York attorney general said her inquiry into the Trump Organisation was now a criminal probe. Letitia James, the state's top prosecutor, has been scrutinising the ex-Republican president's financial dealings before he took office. A spokesperson for Ms James said the inquiry into Mr Trump's property company was ""no longer purely civil"". Mr Trump on Wednesday said she was ""in desperate search of a crime"". Ms James' spokesman, Fabien Levy, told the BBC on Tuesday: ""We have informed the Trump Organization that our investigation into the Organization is no longer purely civil in nature. ""We are now actively investigating the Trump Organization in a criminal capacity, along with the Manhattan DA. We have no additional comment."" The offices of the state attorney general and city district attorney are separate and, according to National Public Radio (NPR), have historically been rivals. The fact that they are now co-ordinating their efforts underscores the high profile of their investigation. The two prosecutors are combing through millions of pages of financial information in a search for evidence, reports NPR. The statement did not say what turned the inquiry from civil to criminal in nature, or whether the former president himself might be personally implicated in any allegations. Mr Trump accused Ms James and District Attorney Cyrus Vance, both Democrats, of being ""possessed"" by their political vendettas against him. A statement from his office rebuked the investigation as ""a continuation of the greatest political Witch Hunt in the history of the United States"". ""After prosecutorial efforts the likes of which nobody has ever seen before, they failed to stop me in Washington, so they turned it over to New York to do their dirty work. This is what I have been going through for years,"" he wrote. The former president's eldest son, Donald Trump Jr, condemned the inquiry as ""flagrant abuse of political office"". On Twitter, he shared an old video of Ms James promising to pursue all legal options against Mr Trump while she was still campaigning for the attorney general role. The video drew fiery comments from other top Trump allies, like senior advisor Stephen Miller, who said the US system of law was being turned into ""a weapon of vengeance not an instrument of justice"". Civil cases usually have to do with injury to individuals or other private parties, including businesses; criminal law applies in cases where the damage is thought to affect society at large, including the state. Six legal battles looming for Trump Ms James launched a civil inquiry in March 2019 into claims that Mr Trump had inflated the value of his assets to banks when seeking loans, and understated them to lower his taxes. Her office has also been seeking documents on four Trump Organization properties in Manhattan, upstate New York, Chicago and Los Angeles. Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr said in court documents last August that his office was investigating alleged ""protracted criminal conduct"" at the Trump Organization. Mr Vance's legal filing cited newspaper articles about purported bank and insurance fraud at the company. The Manhattan district attorney has also been investigating whether any of Mr Trump's financial records were doctored to cover up hush-money payments to two women in 2016 who say they had affairs with him. Mr Vance's office said in February it had obtained Mr Trump's tax returns as part of the investigation, after a long legal battle. Throughout his presidency, Mr Trump resolutely refused to reveal his tax returns, despite coming under great pressure to do so. Allen Weisselberg, the chief financial officer of the Trump Organization, and members of his family have been the focus of the investigators. The clock is ticking. Mr Vance leaves office in December, and he would be expected file any criminal complaint by the end of the year. Will Grant, BBC News, Washington DC Throughout his time in office, Donald Trump dismissed any probe into his financial dealings or those of his organisation as a politically-motivated ""witch hunt"" led by Democrats desperate to see him forced from power. Yet now that he no longer enjoys protection from prosecution, this latest development will trouble him. That a former US president is facing not one but two criminal investigations is a significant development, one which could have repercussions for his political future. The New York State Attorney General, Letitia James, clearly believes that there is enough at play to warrant moving the investigation from a civil to a criminal one.

"The pandemic has placed a huge strain on the NHS The government did not plan enough for a threat on the scale of coronavirus, its spending watchdog has found. The National Audit Office also urged ministers to come up with ideas to prevent widening inequality caused by the pandemic. But it said they had enjoyed some success in their efforts to deal with the crisis, on which Â£372bn had been spent by March this year. The government said it had acted ""quickly and decisively"" throughout. Almost 127,700 people diagnosed with coronavirus have died in the UK, but more than 38.6 million people have received their first vaccination jab since the programme began in December. Nothing conclusive on changing roadmap, says PM Ministers urge vaccine take-up amid variant fears When coronavirus struck in early spring last year, the government lacked plans for many areas of its response in England, including identifying who needed to shield and managing mass disruption to schooling, the NAO said. It added that there had been problems setting up employment support schemes, for which as many as 2.9 million people were not eligible. The report said: ""While the response to the pandemic has provided new learning from both what has worked well and what has not worked well, it has also laid bare existing fault lines within society, such as the risk of widening inequalities, and within public service delivery and government itself."" The government has said it will review the report's recommendations closely and build on its commitment to data transparency and accountability. The criticism comes as Dominic Cummings, former adviser to Prime Minister Boris Johnson, saidthe government's pandemic planning had been ""part disaster, part non-existent""and said ""secrecy contributed greatly to the catastrophe"". Ahead of his appearance before a committee of MPs next week, he said the lack of public scrutiny is still affecting the response to the rise of new variants, such as the B.1.617.2 variant first identified in India, as the UK rolls out vaccinations and takes major steps towards ending coronavirus restrictions. The NAO said in its report that communications had not always been clear and timely, stating that guidance on personal protective equipment (PPE) changed 30 times up to the end of last July. And the report said there had not always been a clear audit trail to support decisions to award PPE contracts. The NAO also warned that the hundreds of billions of pounds spent in response to the pandemic so far may have an impact on the longer-term sustainability of the public finances. UK government borrowing hit Â£303bn in the financial year 2020-21 - the highest amount, as a proportion of national income, since 1946. NAO head Gareth Davies said: ""Covid-19 has required government to respond to an exceptionally challenging and rapidly changing threat. ""There is much to learn from the successes and failures in government's response."" Lessons learned were ""not only important for the remaining phases of the current pandemic, but should also help better prepare the UK for future emergencies"", Mr Davies said. In response, the government said its approach throughout the pandemic had been ""guided by data and the advice of scientific and medical experts"". It said its public health response had brought together Public Health England, the Joint Biosecurity Centre and NHS Test and Trace under one leadership to increase capacity needed to handle a full-blown pandemic. ""As new evidence emerged, we acted quickly and decisively to protect lives and livelihoods,"" a spokesperson said. ""We have committed to a full public independent inquiry to look at what lessons we can learn from our response to this unprecedented global challenge."" LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area?

"A new report has found that too often ""special measures"" - designed to help witnesses give evidence and relieve stress - were not being offered to victims. Photo posed by a model. Rape victims in England and Wales should be able to pre-record evidence and cross-examinations so that they do not have to face perpetrators in court, the victims' commissioner has said. In a new report, Dame Vera Baird has called for the practice to be rolled out ""as soon as practically possible"". It would also reduce stressful waits in the run-up to trials, she told the BBC. The BBC understands the government is considering the move, but it is not clear how it would be implemented. A plan will be laid out in a government review due to be published next month. Ina review of the provision,externalfor vulnerable and intimidated witnesses in courts, Dame Vera said pre-recording interviews would relieve unnecessary stress for those who had experienced sexual assault. ""We've found that almost everybody who was asked had heard victims say how frightened they were to come to court,"" she said. They did not want to come face-to-face with the defendant or their ""supporters"", she said, nor did they want people in the public gallery. She also said the practice would reduce the wait between the witness giving initial evidence to police and being cross-examined in court, which can sometimes be two years because of backlogs made worse by the pandemic. Instead, the evidence and cross-examination could both be filmed soon after the alleged offence, and played to a jury in court once the case reached trial, without any further involvement from the victim. Dame Vera said this would mean the complainant could give their account ""whilst their memory is good"" then move on - and, if they choose, get therapy without fear that their notes could then be used by the defence. She said asking people alleging rape to wait for years before being cross-examined ""preserves the traumatisation"" and can lead to them withdrawing from prosecution altogether. Around43% of rape complainants dropped out of prosecutions,externalin the nine months to December 2020, according to Home Office figures. Those who do proceed can give up if their case is listed for a certain date but cancelled last minute, Dame Vera said, adding: ""It's a torture you don't have to put anyone through."" The law in England and Wales says that under ""special measures"", witnesses who are classed as vulnerable or intimidated are eligible to pre-record their initial evidence and cross-examination. This practice was rolled outfor all vulnerable witnesses - which includes all children - last year.However, it is not currently used for intimidated witnesses, which includes those who allege sexual offences. A pilot was introduced in three courts September 2019 and an evaluation has not yet been published. Dame Vera Baird's report was based on interviews with people working in the criminal justice sector and victim support services. The victims' commissioner's report found that the guilty plea rate was ""notably higher"" when evidence was pre-recorded and the process was less traumatic for witnesses. It also said, more broadly, that too often ""special measures"" - designed to help witnesses give evidence and relieve stress - were not being offered to those who were entitled to them. These measures include the provision of screens to shield witnesses from the defendant in court, and the option to appear in court from a separate room via television link. Among its recommendations is a call for the government to make sure that separate entrances and waiting rooms are available for vulnerable and intimidated witnesses, and to make greater use of remote centres where witnesses can give evidence without attending court. The BBC understands that a government review to be published next month will also include plans to ask judges to bar the public from courts more often and to ensure mobile phones are returned to victims within 24 hours. Katie Russell, spokeswoman for Rape Crisis England and Wales,  told the BBC that these measures, as well as pre-recording evidence, would have the ""potential to improve the unacceptably low levels of criminal justice"" that rape and sexual violence complainants receive. ""All sexual violence and abuse victims and survivors have been subjected to trauma and deserve trauma-informed and sensitive treatment,"" she said. She also said the ""significant length of time"" that mobile phones were kept for had been ""a cause for concern for some time"". ""Being disconnected from friends, family and support networks at such a difficult and stressful time can undoubtedly be distressing,"" she said. In a statement, the Ministry of Justice said: ""We understand how traumatic the court process can be and despite the pandemic we are continuing to improve the support provided for victims."" ""This includes protective screens and video links in every criminal court, more separate waiting rooms as well as piloting the pre-recording of cross-examination for rape victims to help further reduce the stress of attending court,"" it added. ""At the same time, a new Victims' Bill - set out in the Queen's Speech - will strengthen the rights of victims at every stage of the justice system.""

"Offering children in some richer countries a coronavirus vaccine before some high-risk people in poorer ones is ""morally wrong"", a group of MPs has been told. Prof Andrew Pollard, who helped develop the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine, said the ""inequity"" of vaccine distribution must change ""urgently"". The US and Canada have made a jab available to children as young as 12. But in many low-income countries those most at risk are yet to be vaccinated. ""The overall aim of a global vaccination programme in a pandemic is to stop people dying,"" said Prof Pollard, director of the Oxford Vaccine Group, who led the trials for the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine. ""I have worked in Nepal and Bangladesh and colleagues there are facing the most appalling circumstances - they're not working in a situation where there's an NHS to support them,"" he told the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Coronavirus. ""It feels completely wrong to be in a situation morally where we are allowing that to happen whilst in many countries vaccines are being rolled out to younger and younger populations at very, very low risk. ""Children have near to zero risk of severe disease or death."" The Pfizer vaccine, which has been approved in the US and Canada, has completed trials in adolescents. And a number of other Covid vaccines are being tested on this age group and younger. But Prof Pollard said: ""The main issue at the moment is to try and make sure the doses go to those in greatest need. ""This is a global problem which impacts our economies and puts pressure on health systems."" Studies show over-50s, people with certain health conditions and healthcare workers are most likely to become seriously ill or die from coronavirus - but many in parts of Africa and South Asia are still waiting for a vaccine. Campaigners warn supply shortages are a huge concern. Covax, the international scheme to ensure equal access to Covid vaccines, is currently short of 140 million doses, after a disruption in supply from India. Unicef and the World Health Organization have both called on wealthier countries to share their surplus supplies, as some have ordered enough to vaccinate their populations many times over. A Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office spokesperson said Â£548 million has been provided to deliver more than a billion vaccines to more than 70 countries. They added the UK will share the ""majority of any future surplus coronavirus vaccines from our supply with the COVAX pool, when these are available"". India's Covid crisis hits vaccine-sharing scheme Prof Pollard said his key message to the government would be to act with ""absolute urgency"" or ""many millions could die between now and September"". ""We can't wait until later this year to make decisions, he said. ""It has to be now that we look at redistribution and how we get doses to countries that have poor access at the moment - and that is through Covax."" UK pledges surplus Covid vaccines to poorer nations Another witness told the MPs' panel richer countries were ""hoarding doses"" and he feared they would do the same with potential booster shots in the future. But the production of vaccine in low- and middle-income countries would prevent this. ""We hear from so many manufacturers in places like Pakistan and Bangladesh and Indonesia - they're ready, they've got some capacity,"" Prof Gavin Yamey, director of the Centre for Policy Impact in Global Health, at Duke University, in the US, said. ""It's fine to continue donating - but there has to be a long-term vision. ""This pandemic could be with us for years. ""Is it really just going to be charity - drip, drip, drip of a few doses from rich countries? ""That's not a long-term vision."" LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area?

"Charles Grodin won several awards for his parts in TV and film productions Charles Grodin, an American actor whose comic roles in films such as Midnight Run and Beethoven brought smiles to faces for decades, has died at 86. Grodin died at his home in Wilton, Connecticut on Tuesday, the New York Times newspaper reported. The actor's son, Nicholas, told the newspaper his cause of death was bone marrow cancer. Known for his dry wit, Grodin was a familiar face in Hollywood comedies and prime-time talk shows in the US. Tributes have been made on social media, includinga tweet from fellow American actor Steve Martin,external, who described Grodin as ""one of the funniest people I ever met"". Charles Grodin had a career in acting, writing and comedy that spanned decades Born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, Grodin dropped his studies at the University of Miami to launch a career in acting. It was a decision that paid off in the 1960s, when he started to land parts in plays on Broadway, including his debut in a production of Tchin-Tchin, which starred Anthony Quinn. He soon moved to TV and film, building his profile with a small role in Rosemary's Baby, a 1968 psychological horror film written and directed by Roman Polanski. But the 1970s was the decade Grodin's career really took off. A series of roles in films including Catch-22 in 1970 and The Heartbreak Kid in 1972 cemented his status as one of Hollywood's go-to comedy actors. For his role in The Heartbreak Kid - in which he plays an unlucky-in-love sporting goods salesman - he was nominated for a Golden Globe Award for best actor. The fact he didn't win the award may not have bothered him too much. ""I never complain about anything, because I'm aware of what's going on around me, and I'm also aware that there are a lot of very gifted people that never even get a job in show business,"" Grodin told the AV Club website in a 2009 interview. ""It's just because they can't handle the rejection, and I can handle it, and I'm used to it."" Grodin played an angry dad in the 1992 film Beethoven Grodin had his share of success as well. He won best actor at the 1988 Valladolid International Film Festival for his role in Midnight Run. In that film, a 1988 action-comedy, he co-starred with Robert De Niro as an accountant who embezzled millions from a mob boss. Grodin also won an Emmy as a co-writer on a 1977 Paul Simon TV special, hosted his own 1990s chat show, and was a regular fixture on shows hosted by Johnny Carson, David Letterman and Jay Leno. One of Grodin's most well-known roles was in the popular family film Beethoven in 1992. He plays a short-tempered dad who, to his fury, is bedevilled by a slobbering, accident-prone dog.
