"This video can not be played Angry protesters stormed Kensington Town Hall, demanding answers Protests were held in London as residents demanded support for those affected by the Grenfell Tower fire. Between 50 and 60 people stormed Kensington and Chelsea Town Hall as members of the public said the homeless needed help ""right now"". Crowds gathered outside a hall where PM Theresa May met survivors and protests were also held at Downing Street. Mrs May sanctioned Â£5m for clothes, food and emergency supplies, as the death toll rose to at least 30. The BBC understands those missing could number about 70, with the 30 likely to be among that number. Three of those who diedhave been identified. There was nothing to suggest the fire was started deliberately, police said. Between 50 and 60 protesters rushed into the council building Hundreds of mourners stood arm in arm at a vigil and held a two-minute silence for victims of the fire. Many wept openly as candles illuminated the road outside the Latymer Christian Centre, yards from the site of the blaze. The fire broke out shortly before 01:00 BST on Wednesday. It tore through all floors of the building and took more than 200 firefighters 24 hours to bring it under control. Mahad Egal, who escaped his fourth floor flat with his family, said: ""At first it seemed it was controllable, but really quickly the fire started to rise as the cladding caught fire. It is incredible we survived."" Emergency services spent a third day searching for bodies in the burnt-out Grenfell Tower in North Kensington. A vigil has been set up near to the site of the disaster Hundreds gathered arm in arm and raised candles as they observed a two-minute silence This video can not be played An angry crowd chanted to Theresa May: ""Shame on you!"" The first protest began at around 15:00 at the town hall and scores later joined it. At about 16:30, people began to rush up the steps and make their way into the building. One member of the public said: ""Nobody knows what is happening. People are so angry. Those people shouldn't be sleeping in the street."" Mustafa Al Mansur, who organised the protest, read a statement from the council which promised to re-house as many people locally as they could and to provide funding for those affected. But he called the response ""flimsy"" with ""no concrete answers"" - especially on the question of number of residents who lived in the flats. Latest updates: Death toll expected to rise What we know so far 'The working class aren't being listened to' How one Grenfell Tower resident escaped May faces criticism over Grenfell visit ""The people were not satisfied with the answers,"" he told BBC News. ""The people were getting frustrated and they walked towards the building. They did not force themselves inside. They got inside the main building and were in the foyer, just speaking."" Police then arrived on the scene and formed a barricade, which Mr Al Mansur said led to ""physical confrontation"" between the two sides. There were then angry scenes outside the Clement James Centre, in North Kensington, where the meeting with the prime minister and residents of the tower had been held. Police surrounded a car outside the church and community centre Dozens of demonstrators surged towards the entrance and there were scuffles outside as organisers appealed for calm. Mrs May had faced criticism for not meeting with survivors in the immediate aftermath, unlike Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn and Mayor of London Sadiq Khan. Fragile government facing huge challenge Asked about the reaction of the crowd, Mrs May defended the government's response. ""What I am now absolutely focused on is ensuring we get that support on the ground,"" she said. This video can not be played Theresa May says Â£5m will be available for survivors, and the cause of the Kensington fire is being looked at ""The government is making money available, we are ensuring we are going to get to the bottom of what has happened, we will ensure that people are re-housed. We need to make sure that actually happens."" Mr Corbyn wrote an open letter to the prime minister, calling for the public inquiry to ensure ""all necessary lessons are learned"". The Labour leader added:  ""[The inquiry] must be empowered to consider all the steps that were, or were not, taken leading up to and contributing to this most terrible incident. ""It must also identify the urgent steps that need to be taken in relation to fire safety standards for other buildings of this nature."" Families appeal for missing relatives Sense of community shines through Requisition houses, urges Corbyn Grenfell Tower wall of condolence - read the tributes Large crowds of people also gathered in Westminster and made their way to Downing Street. The crowd was heard chanting, ""Justice for Grenfell"", along with ""May must go"" and ""blood on your hands"". A peaceful march started making its way down Whitehall and was halted by police outside Downing Street, before moving to Oxford Circus, where demonstrators carried out a sit-down protest. The march continued up Regent Street, where they held a minute's silence outside the BBC's headquarters, and continued towards Marble Arch and Notting Hill, ending at Lancaster Gate. Protesters begin marching from Parliament Square The Â£5m Grenfell Tower Residents' Discretionary Fund, announced by Mrs May, includes the aim to re-house residents within three weeks as close to where they lived before as possible, to pay for temporary housing in the meantime and to provide extra financial assistance. During her meeting with survivors, the PM also said they would be consulted on the terms of the public inquiry announced on Thursday and receive state funding for legal representation. Mrs May said: ""Everyone affected by this tragedy needs reassurance that the government is there for them at this terrible time - and that is what I am determined to provide."" The Queen and Duke of Cambridge also met volunteers, residents and community representatives during a visit to the Westway Sports Centre. The Queen paid tribute to the ""bravery"" of firefighters and the ""incredible generosity"" of volunteers now offering support.

"This video can not be played USS Fitzgerald damaged by the crash Seven US Navy crew members are missing after their ship collided with a merchant vessel off the coast of Japan. Among the injured is the USS Fitzgerald's commanding officer, who was taken to hospital by helicopter. The destroyer collided with the container ship about 56 nautical miles (104km) south-west of Yokosuka. Aerial images showed heavy damage to the Navy ship's starboard side after the collision at about 02:30 local time on Saturday (17:30 GMT Friday). The collision occurred near Yokosuka, a Japanese port city that is home to the US 7th Fleet, which comprises up to 80 submarines and ships and including the USS Fitzgerald. It is unclear where the 154-metre (505ft) guided missile destroyer ship was heading at the time. The ACX Crystal, a 222-metre (730ft) Filipino-flagged container ship, was travelling between the Japanese cities of Nagoya and Tokyo. Marine traffic records suggest the ACX Crystal made a sudden U-turn roughly 25 minutes before the collision with the USS Fitzgerald. It is not clear why it changed course. Marine traffic records suggest it was travelling at 14.6 knots (27km/h) at the time of the collision. USS Fitzgerald crash: In pictures The ACX Crystal appeared to make a U-turn before the collision, before rapidly adjusting course and setting off to Tokyo Marine traffic records for the USS Fitzgerald are not publicly available. Japan's coastguard is co-ordinating the search with US teams for the seven missing crew members. As of late afternoon local time, the 7th Fleet said the crew members were still unaccounted for. The Navy ship's commanding officer, Cdr Bryce Benson, was in a stable condition after being transferred to US Naval Hospital Yokosuka, according to Navy officials. Two other sailors were flown to hospital by helicopter for treatments for ""lacerations and bruises"", the 7th Fleetsaid on Twitter,external. By mid-afternoon local time, it said that all flooding on board the USS Fitzgerald was under control. It is not at risk of sinking. The ship has now returned to Yokosuka - under its own power, but with limited propulsion. The damage to the ACX Crystal was less serious than to the Navy ship The Japanese coastguard said the ACX Crystal had a gross tonnage of nearly 30,000, about three times that of the USS Fitzgerald. It sustained lighter damage to its port bow, and has now reached Tokyo. The Associated Press agency said there were no injuries reported among the 20 Filipino crew members on board the container ship. Relatives of those on board the USS Fitzgerald have been posting on the US 7th Fleet's Facebook page, requesting information on their loved-ones. An information hotlinehas been set up,external. The collision took place in waters that get heavy traffic and that have experienced prior collisions, Japanese broadcaster NHK said. Ships travelling to and from Tokyo, as well as crossing the Pacific in both directions, pass through the bay where the crash happened. NHKsaid that,externalan association of commercial ship captains is calling for the creation of east-west lanes in the area to avoid collisions. In a statementreleased on social media,external, US Navy operations chief Adm John Richardson said: ""As more information is learned we will be sure to share it with the Fitzgerald families and when appropriate the public. [...] All our thoughts and concerns are with the Fitzgerald crew and their families."" The area where the collision took place is extremely busy, with shipping heading in and out of Tokyo bay. However, the USS Fitzgerald is one of the most advanced warships in the world - with highly sophisticated radar systems. At the moment the focus is on the search for the missing sailors. Later will come the investigation into how one of the world's most sophisticated warships failed to avoid colliding with a 30,000-tonne cargo ship on a calm, clear night.

"Coconut oil is as unhealthy as beef dripping and butter, say US heart experts. It is packed with saturated fat which can raise ""bad"" cholesterol, says the American Heart Association inupdated advice,external. Coconut oil is commonly sold as a health food and some claim the fat in it may be better for us than other saturated fats. The AHA, however, says there are no good studies to support this. The health benefits of coconut oil,external The advice around which fats to eat can be very confusing. Animal fats, such as lard, are generally seen as bad, while plant oils, such as olive and sunflower, are seen as healthier options. That theory is based on how much of one particular type of fat - saturated fat or ""sat fat"" - these products contain. Saturated fat is said to be bad for our health, althoughnot everyone agrees. Eating a diet high in saturated fat can raise the level of ""bad"" (LDL) cholesterol in the blood, which, in turn, may clog the arteries and increase the risk of heart disease and stroke. According to the AHA, 82% of the fat in coconut oil is saturated. That's more than in butter (63%), beef fat (50%) and pork lard (39%). And, like other saturated fats, studies show it can increase ""bad"" cholesterol. Some claim that the mixture of fats in coconut oil still make it a healthy option, but the AHA says there is no good-quality evidence for this. It says people should limit how much saturated fat they eat, replacing some of it with unsaturated vegetable oils - olive oil and sunflower oil, and their spreads. According to the AHA, studies show swaps such as this can lower cholesterol by the same magnitude as cholesterol-lowering drugs. Dr Frank Sacks, lead author of the AHA advice, said: ""We want to set the record straight on why well-conducted scientific research overwhelmingly supports limiting saturated fat in the diet to prevent diseases of the heart and blood vessels."" In the UK, Public Health England advises people to cut down on saturated fat: the average man should eat no more than 30g of saturated fat a day the average woman should eat no more than 20g of saturated fat a day Nutritional labels on food display how much saturated fat is in products. But experts stress that fat is still an essential part of a healthy, balanced diet. We shouldn't cut out too much. Fat is a source of essential fatty acids and helps the body absorb vitamins, such as A, D and E. Victoria Taylor from the British Heart Foundation said: ""To eat well for your heart health it is not just about reducing fat but reducing specific types of fat and taking care over what these are replaced with - unsaturated fats and wholegrains, rather than sugars and refined carbohydrates. ""Any change should be viewed in the context of a whole diet approach. The traditional Mediterranean diet has benefits for a range of risk factors for heart disease, not just cholesterol levels. ""We recommend replacing the saturated fats in the diet with unsaturated fats - using oils instead of butter and choosing foods like avocado, oily fish, nuts and seeds instead of foods high in saturated fats like cakes, biscuits, chocolate and fatty meat."" Grill, bake, poach or steam food rather than deep frying or roasting Trim visible fat and take skin off meat before cooking Spoon off fats and oils from roasts, casseroles, stews and curries When making sandwiches, try leaving out the butter or spread: you might not need it if you're using a moist filling Cholesterol is a fatty substance Low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol is said to be 'bad' because it can be deposited in the walls of arteries and cause hard plaques to build up that can cause blockages, resulting in heart attacks and stroke High-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol is 'good' because it carries LDL cholesterol to your liver where it is disposed of.

"Ms Bookman was escorted out after seeing this message A US woman is suing a casino that told her the slot machine displaying a $43m (Â£34m) jackpot was faulty and offered a steak dinner instead, reports say. Katrina Bookman took a selfie showing the machine saying ""printing cash ticket $42,949,672.76"" at the Resorts World Casino in New York last August. But she was escorted out and was told the next day she could have only $2.25 (Â£1.76). Her lawyer, Alan Ripka, says she is entitled to the full amount displayed. The lawsuit filed at the Queens County Supreme Court said the Sphinx slot machine's ""bells, noises and lights"" as well as the message on the screen told Ms Bookman she had won the jackpot, Courthouse Newsreported,external. The subsequent disappointment left Ms Bookman anxious and depressed, the report said. She is seeking damages from the casino for failing to maintain the slot machine as well as two companies that make and operate games machine, reports said. A Resorts World spokesman said at the time that the machine had suffered an ""obvious malfunction"". The New York State Gaming Commission said the machine had been displaying a disclaimer that said ""malfunctions void all pays and plays"". But Mr Ripka told US media at the time that the casino had not responded to requests for an explanation about how the slot machine malfunctioned. In 2011 the Iowa Supreme Courtdenied an 87-year old grandmother a payout of $42mafter a Miss Kitty slot machine showed a message saying she had won a bonus of that amount.

"Paul O'Neill has been sentenced to life in prison A former teacher who paid men to abuse children as young as four in the Philippines while he watched online has been jailed for life. Paul O'Neill, 57, from Nottinghamshire, ordered the abuse in advance, giving specific instructions on what he wanted to see, Nottingham Crown Court heard. He admitted three counts of rape and a further 27 sexual offences. He was told he would serve a minimum of 12 years. The CPS said the virtual rape case was thought to be the first of its kind. Updates on this story and more from the East Midlands The court heard O'Neill, who retired from teaching in August, used chat logs to instruct adult abusers in the Philippines. The married father paid thousands of pounds over several years to arrange abuse to satisfy his ""fetishes"" with child abuse, virginity and incest. Sentencing O'Neill, Judge Gregory Dickinson said: ""You demanded that these children should suffer pain and degradation. You derived pleasure and satisfaction from seeing little girls being deflowered. ""Some of these ghastly events you recorded, for repeat reviewing. You are a danger to children. Given the chance, you will offend again. ""You are obsessed with, and addicted to, this most vile and horrific abuse. This is a case without parallel on the experience of all of us involved: police, counsel and judge. ""This is even worse than a rape campaign."" Nottingham Crown Court heard O'Neill paid thousands of pounds over several years to arrange abuse to satisfy his ""fetishes"" with virginity and incest O'Neill, of Wroxham Drive, Wollaton Vale, enjoyed the financial imbalance between him and his victims, who were girls aged between four and 15. Some were from families desperate for cash for medicine and hospital bills, the court heard. On one occasion, he offered to double his payment if the victim was aged just five. Prosecutor James Varley told the court: ""Mr O'Neill, a retired teacher, a bastion of the local church community and a Sunday school teacher, appeared to be a wholesome married father of two. ""In fact, he had a dark side to him which he kept concealed - he was obsessed with the sexual exploitation of pre-pubescent girls... and enjoyed the sexual abuse and degradation of young girls."" Shaun Smith QC, defending, said O'Neill had become addicted to commissioning the abuse, and ""de-sensitised"" to the damage he was causing. He said: ""What started out as looking at matters which he had obviously Googled quickly escalated into the offending, and sadly - as is all too common on the internet - it developed with speed and seriousness. ""From the privacy and safety of his own home it was all too easy for him to be sunk into this world of depravity."" Offences admitted by O'Neill included child rape, conspiracy to rape, arranging the commission of child abuse and child prostitution. He also pleaded guilty to making 3,416 indecent images of children between 2008 and 2016, and possessing a further 2,832 prohibited images when he was arrested in November last year.

"The claim:Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn says the government should requisition housing if necessary for those made homeless by the Grenfell Tower fire. Reality Check verdict:Doing so would not be allowed under current rules, and legislation to allow property to be seized in peacetime would be controversial. Labour leaderJeremy Corbyn said:""It cannot be acceptable that in London you have luxury buildings and luxury flats kept as land banking for the future while the homeless and the poor look for somewhere to live."" Mr Corbyn's spokesman was asked about the legality of this and said: ""We would find a way to do this if necessary - we are looking into the ways in which it could be done depending on circumstances."" The obvious example of governments forcing owners to allow their properties to be used was during the two World Wars. Many stately homes were requisitioned as part of the war effort. Bletchley Park, where crucial code-breaking was carried out, was bought privately before the war, but requisition was later used to extend the site. Land around Bletchley Park was requisitioned as part of the war effort The government had to pass legislation in order to do that - the Defence of the Realm Act in 1914 and the Emergency Powers Act in 1939 - but this does not appear to have happened in peacetime to meet emergency housing needs. ""Any property requisitions may therefore require emergency legislation in Parliament to instigate and would probably prove controversial,"" said Mark Woloshak, a lawyer from Slater and Gordon. Local authorities do have the power to force someone to sell their land, using something called a compulsory purchase order (CPO). These are used when there is a strong public interest justification, in order to ""deliver social, environmental and economic change"", according togovernment guidance,external. For example, if land or buildings are empty, they might be compulsorily purchased in order to redevelop housing estates or to build a public road. The owner will be compensated. However, doing this with empty luxury flats would be extremely expensive. Also,research from the London School of Economics,externalrecently found ""almost no evidence of units being left entirely empty - certainly less than 1%"", but that ""for those units bought as second homes, occupancy could be as little as a few weeks a year"". And there are questions as to whether the exercise of this power in the context Mr Corbyn refers to would be lawful. ""It wouldn't stand in the courtsâ¦ it would be a breach of the purpose that legislation is for,"" said lawyer Chad Sutton from Planning Clarity Legal. Acquiring land through a compulsory purchase order is also not a quick process, often taking up to two years before public bodies can get access to the land, so this would not be a quick fix to rehouse displaced people in the short term. CPOs are intended as a last resort after the authorities have attempted to negotiate with the landowners. There are currently no powers available to force an owner to rent out their property if it is vacant. Local authorities have access to use Empty Dwelling Management Orders, but those are designed to allow local authorities to step in when empty properties have become targets for vandalism or a blight on the neighbourhood. There are restrictions on their use that would prevent them applying to luxury flats in good condition, even if they were empty. So, to provide emergency housing in the current circumstance, the government would need legislation either to allow requisitions or the use of CPOs.

"Mr Trump again calls the Russia investigation a ""witch hunt"" President Donald Trump has appeared to acknowledge he is under investigation in the inquiry into alleged Russian meddling in the US election. In a tweet, the president also seemed to accuse the US deputy attorney general of pursuing a ""Witch Hunt"". He said: ""I am being investigated for firing the FBI Director by the man who told me to fire the FBI Director!"" Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein wrote a memo the White House used to justify the firing of the ex-FBI chief. Mr Rosenstein took over the investigation into whether Russia tried to tip the US election in favour of Mr Trump after Attorney General Jeff Sessions recused himself in March. The deputy attorney generallater appointed Special Counsel Robert Muellerto lead the inquiry. The FBI and Congress are both looking at whether Trump campaign officials colluded with the alleged Kremlin plot. The inquiries have yet to show evidence of collusion. Is Trump closer to obstruction of justice? A legal 'dream team' looking at Trump Russia: The 'cloud' over the White House Who is Robert Mueller? Mr Trump also tweeted on Friday morning: ""After 7 months of investigations & committee hearings about my 'collusion with the Russians,' nobody has been able to show any proof. Sad!"" His tweets come as Mr Trump marks two years since announcing his plan to run for president. When it was first announced a month ago that a special counsel had been appointed to investigate the Trump campaign's links to Russia, the White House issued a restrained statement from the president expressing the hope that the inquiry would be conducted swiftly. But the more a furious president has taken his defence into his own hands, the deeper the waters swirling around him have become. He contradicted the Justice Department over the reasons for sacking the FBI Director, James Comey, telling a TV interviewer that he was fired because of ""this Russia thing"". That in turn led to reports this week that Donald Trump himself was now under investigation by the special counsel, Robert Mueller, for possible obstruction of justice. Mr Trump's latest tweet on Friday morning represented a none-too-veiled attack on the deputy attorney general Rob Rosenstein, who appointed the special counsel. The advice from Mr Trump's family, his legal team and his closest confidantes has been to say nothing and let the special counsel do his work. It's advice that has been spectacularly rejected. In other developments: Mr Rosenstein may have to recuse himself from the Russia investigation if he is called on as a potential witness in the matter, ABC News reports Vice-President Mike Pencehas hired an outside lawyerto handle inquiries into the Trump campaign's potential ties to the Kremlin The Justice Department's special counsel is also investigating President Trump's son-in-law and senior adviser, Jared Kushner, and his business dealings,according to the Washington Post,external Whyis Mr Trump being investigated? Mr Trump was not under investigation before Mr Comey's firing, but reportedly is nowfacing scrutiny for obstruction of justiceover the circumstances surrounding the ex-FBI chief's sacking, according to US media. Special Counsel Mueller was reportedly planning to interview intelligence officials on whether Mr Trump got rid of the FBI director, James Comey, in May to hamper an inquiry into his sacked national security adviser, Michael Flynn. Mr Comey, who had been leading one of several Russia inquiries,testified to Congress last weekthat the president had pressured him to drop an inquiry into links between Mr Flynn and Russia. Mr Flynn was forced out in February after he misled the vice-president about his conversations with Russia's ambassador before Mr Trump took office. This video can not be played Trump says he made the decision to fire Comey - that's not what the White House originally said. The White House has said the president ""has never asked Mr Comey or anyone else to end any investigation, including any investigation involving General Flynn"". Friday's tweet marked the first time Mr Trump has publicly acknowledged he is under investigation. Mr Comey said he was ""sure"" Mr Mueller was looking at whether Mr Trump had obstructed justice, but added that to his knowledge, the president had not tried to impede the Russia inquiry. Mr Trump is unlikely to face criminal prosecution as a sitting president, but obstruction of justice could be grounds for impeachment. Mr Rosenstein's memo was initially used to justify the firing of FBI chief James Comey Though the president did not name Mr Rosenstein in his morning tweet, he appeared to refer to a memo the US deputy attorney general wrote. The memo, which the White House claimed was the impetus for Mr Comey's dismissal, criticised the FBI chief's failure to follow rules and procedures in his handling of an investigation into Hillary Clinton's private email use while Secretary of State. Mr Rosenstein appointed Mr Mueller following growing demands from Democrats to appoint an independent special prosecutor to examine the Russia allegations. It is unlikely the president is referring to Mr Mueller in his tweet because Mr Mueller would not have been in a position to fire Mr Comey.

"London is increasingly becoming a city of high-rise living. There are more than 700 tower blocks, ranging from brand new luxury developments to the post-war council-owned buildings seen as a quick fix to cure problems caused by crumbling and unsanitary 19th Century hovels. About 8% of Londoners now live in tower blocks. Some flats are bought for millions; others are relatively low-cost social housing rented from a local council at a fraction of the private rate. Grenfell Tower itself was designed in 1967, started in 1972 and finished in 1974. Originally built as municipal housing as part of the slum clearances of the 1960s, it had 120 one- and two-bedroom flats over 20 of its 24 storeys, and was renovated in 2016. It's in a neighbourhood ranked among the most deprived 10% in England. Just two miles away - or four stops along the Circle/Hammersmith and City line - is 3 Merchant Square, a 21-storey tower that is part of a new development around Paddington Basin. The contemporary block was finished in 2016 and holds 60 apartments over 15 storeys. It's a different world. The penthouse apartment was sold for Â£7.5m. One-bedroom flats are at least Â£1m. Surrounded by restaurants and bars, workers and residents can lounge on deckchairs on a newly-built floating park. Lunchtime yoga sessions are held and there's a luxury fitness club. There's an enormous fountain and a bridge created by renowned designer Thomas Heatherwick, a nursery and winter garden. But nice though these peripheries undoubtedly are, they don't keep people safe from fire. For that, we must have a look at the specifications of the apartments in the tower. Once you get past the sales brochure description of 3 Merchant Square's walnut cutlery drawer inserts and integral wine coolers, the adjustable mood lighting and heated bathroom walls, you come to the fire safety details: Every flat has not only ceiling mounted smoke detectors but sprinklers. The International Fire Sprinkler Association (IFSA) says that automatic fire sprinkler systems are the single most effective fire protection measure available, and are able to make up for a wide range of other fire protection deficiencies. There has never been a multiple loss of life from a fire developing in a building protected by a properly designed, installed and maintained fire sprinkler system. While fire sprinkler systems have been required in new high-rise residential buildings in England since 2007, it is not compulsory to retrofit them into existing buildings. So Grenfell Tower had none. Former chief fire officer Ronnie King, honorary secretary of the all-party parliamentary group on fire safety and rescue - which had recommended fitting sprinklers to buildings to save lives - said the regulations ""badly need updating"" and ""three successive ministers have not done it"". ""My own thinking is there was the red tape challenge and they don't really want to put regulation on to businesses, adding a burden. ""It's one of those that if you bring in a new regulation, you have got to give three up to get it."" A2012 report by the British Automatic Fire Sprinkler Association,external(BAFSA) concluded that fire sprinklers could be retrofitted with tenants in place at a cost of about Â£1,150 a flat. Since the 24-storey Grenfell Tower contained 120 flats, it would have worked out at Â£138,000. That's significantly less than theÂ£2.6m spent on the cladding and replacement windows,external. Do you live in a tower block with similar cladding to Grenfell Tower? Let us know by emailinghaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external Architect and fire expert Sam Webb said: ""We are still wrapping post-war high-rise buildings in highly flammable materials and leaving them without sprinkler systems installed, then being surprised when they burn down. ""I really don't think the building industry understands how fire behaves in buildings and how dangerous it can be. The government's mania for deregulation means our current safety standards just aren't good enough."" Some of these issues were raised in a report following afatal fire at a tower block in 2009in Camberwell, in which six people were killed. Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government Sajid Javid said his predecessor in the role had accepted the report's recommendations and put them into action. ""The coroner did not recommend new planning regulations. The coroner recommended a change in the guidance. There is a lot of information out there and it is right that it is independently looked at by a judge-led inquiry,"" Mr Javid said. When asked whether the government would retrofit sprinkler systems to tower blocks, he said: ""I don't think we can immediately jump to the conclusion that sprinklers is the issue here. We will do whatever it takes."" The Grenfell Action Group complained about uncollected rubbish in corridors, pointing out it was a fire risk Another factor adding to the building's fire risk, according to the Grenfell Action Group, was the fact that in the past rubbish, having accumulated in the hallways of the tower, was not collected. At one point, the only emergency exit to the building was cluttered with an old mattress, sheets of cardboard and a broken heater. It's hard to imagine residents in 3 Merchant Square having to put up with rubbish filling the corridors. An associate pastor of Notting Hill Community Church, Danny Vance, says ""the poor are constantly neglected"" in the city. ""The disparity between rich and poor in this city is disgusting,"" he said. ""This would not have happened to the Â£5m flats around the corner."" Live coverage of the Grenfell fire aftermath What we know so far about Grenfell Tower Six questions for the investigation The average salary in the Royal Borough of Kensington & Chelsea, in which the tower block stands, is Â£123,000: the highest in the UK. But the median average - the midpoint of all salaries in the area - is Â£32,700. No other local authority in the country has such a large gap between these two averages, pointing to a huge contrast between high and low earners. There is a similarly large gap when measuring the total income for people in the area. The average is Â£158,000, but the median is Â£38,700. Again, no other local authority in the UK reports such a difference. In laymen's terms, it means that the total income in the area, if distributed among the local population, would be Â£123,000 per resident, the highest in the UK.  Yet half of the population there earns less than Â£32,700, highlighting the extreme disparity between top earners and those at the lower end of the spectrum. Source:Department for Communities and Local Government, the Office for National Statistics, and Her Majesty's Revenue & Customs. Hannah Mansell, chair of the Passive Fire Protection Forum and trustee of the Children's Burns Trust, said: ""I regularly sit in meetings with fire safety professionals, and their fury and frustration at the inaction of local councils and social landlords is palpable. ""We have been warning about the risks of a fire like this for years. ""'What we need to get people to take notice is a huge fire in a tower block' they say. ""Well, here it is. There's an endemic fire safety problem in this type of housing stock."" As Ronnie King says, ""it's sad that we always have to go to stable-door legislation"" after a tragedy.

"This video can not be played How text messages led to a suicide A Massachusetts judge has ruled that a woman who sent dozens of texts encouraging her boyfriend to commit suicide is guilty of his death. Michelle Carter, now 20, was convicted of involuntary manslaughter for her messages to 18-year-old Conrad Roy urging him to kill himself. He took his own life on 13 July 2014 by running a generator in his vehicle in a car park in Fairhaven, Massachusetts. Carter, who could face up to 20 years in prison, sobbed in court. She encouraged her boyfriend to take his own life so she could seek attention as the ""grieving girlfriend"", the trial heard. The case appears to set a legal precedent, as there is no Massachusetts law that criminalises telling a person to commit suicide. Judge Lawrence Moniz said Ms Carter was guilty of ""wanton and reckless conduct"" by sending Mr Roy a message instructing him to get back in the truck, which he had exited as it filled with fumes. ""She called no one and finally she did not issue a simple additional instruction - get out of the truck,"" he said. What the texting suicide case tells us Carter reportedly texted Mr Roy that his parents would ""get over"" his suicide The accused broke down in tears as the judge delivered his verdict. The victim's father, also called Conrad Roy, said in a press conference the family was ""thankful"" for the verdict. ""This has been a very tough time for our family, and we would like to process this verdict that we are happy with,"" he said outside court. Carter has been allowed by the judge to remain free on bail, pending sentencing, but is banned from sending text messages or using any social media network. The criminal charge against Carter meant that prosecutors had to prove that she had a ""direct"" role in Mr Roy's death. If you are depressed and need to ask for help, there's advice on who to contact atBBC Advice. From Canada or US: If you're in an emergency, please call 911. If you or someone you know is suffering with mental-health issues, call Kids Help Phone at 1-800-668-6868. If you're in the US, you can text HOME to 741741 From UK: Call Samaritans on 116123 or Childline on 0800 1111 Judge Moniz, who handed down the ruling because Carter chose not to have a jury trial, said the fact that Mr Roy had previously attempted to take his own life, or that he might have done so again, was not relevant. Assistant District Attorney Katie Rayburn told the court in her closing arguments that the directness required by the involuntary manslaughter statute required updating for the modern age. ""Back years ago in order to have a relationship you had to actually see somebody - or at a minimum talk on the phone. That is no longer required. People fall in love via the internet and via text. People bully via text and the internet. You can encourage someone to die via text, and you can commit a crime via text,"" she said. The case drew national attention after the texts sent between the two teenagers were revealed by investigators. ""Hang yourself, jump off a building, stab yourself I don't know there's a lot of ways,"" she said in several messages sent in the two weeks before his death, as he was on holiday with his family. In the moments before his suicide, she wrote: ""You need to do it, Conrad"" and ""All you have to do is turn the generator on and you will be free and happy."" Mr Roy had been due to attend university in the autumn In another message, she wrote: ""You're finally going to be happy in heaven. No more pain. It's okay to be scared and it's normal. I mean, you're about to die."" Prosecutors argued that Carter had manipulated Mr Roy, who had a history of depression and suicide attempts, into taking his own life, advising him that it would be ""painless"". But Carter's defence team argued that Mr Roy had planned his own suicide, and had gone so far as to secure the equipment that he used to take his own life. They also said anti-depression medication that Carter was taking had affected her judgment. As Mr Conrad's truck filled with poisonous carbon monoxide, he left his vehicle to speak on the phone, with Carter, who was nearly 30 miles (48km) away at the time. Investigators did not have a recording of that call, but in a text to a friend, Carter described what was said. ""Sam, [the victim's] death is my fault like honestly I could have stopped him I was on the phone with him and he got out of the [truck] because it was working and he got scared and I [expletive] told him to get back in Sam because I knew he would do it all over again the next day and I couldnt have him live the way he was living anymore I couldnt do it I wouldnt let him,"" she wrote after his death. Another message to her friend stated: ""I was on the phone talking to him when he killed himself. I heard him dying."" She also contacted a friend when she learned that investigators were looking through Mr Roy's phone. ""They read my text messages to him I'm done"", the accused wrote, adding, ""his family will hate me and I could go to jail"". She will be sentenced on 3 August 2017.

"This video can not be played Angry protesters stormed Kensington Town Hall, demanding answers Protests were held in London as residents demanded support for those affected by the Grenfell Tower fire. Between 50 and 60 people stormed Kensington and Chelsea Town Hall as members of the public said the homeless needed help ""right now"". Crowds gathered outside a hall where PM Theresa May met survivors and protests were also held at Downing Street. Mrs May sanctioned Â£5m for clothes, food and emergency supplies, as the death toll rose to at least 30. The BBC understands those missing could number about 70, with the 30 likely to be among that number. Three of those who diedhave been identified. There was nothing to suggest the fire was started deliberately, police said. Between 50 and 60 protesters rushed into the council building Hundreds of mourners stood arm in arm at a vigil and held a two-minute silence for victims of the fire. Many wept openly as candles illuminated the road outside the Latymer Christian Centre, yards from the site of the blaze. The fire broke out shortly before 01:00 BST on Wednesday. It tore through all floors of the building and took more than 200 firefighters 24 hours to bring it under control. Mahad Egal, who escaped his fourth floor flat with his family, said: ""At first it seemed it was controllable, but really quickly the fire started to rise as the cladding caught fire. It is incredible we survived."" Emergency services spent a third day searching for bodies in the burnt-out Grenfell Tower in North Kensington. A vigil has been set up near to the site of the disaster Hundreds gathered arm in arm and raised candles as they observed a two-minute silence This video can not be played An angry crowd chanted to Theresa May: ""Shame on you!"" The first protest began at around 15:00 at the town hall and scores later joined it. At about 16:30, people began to rush up the steps and make their way into the building. One member of the public said: ""Nobody knows what is happening. People are so angry. Those people shouldn't be sleeping in the street."" Mustafa Al Mansur, who organised the protest, read a statement from the council which promised to re-house as many people locally as they could and to provide funding for those affected. But he called the response ""flimsy"" with ""no concrete answers"" - especially on the question of number of residents who lived in the flats. Latest updates: Death toll expected to rise What we know so far 'The working class aren't being listened to' How one Grenfell Tower resident escaped May faces criticism over Grenfell visit ""The people were not satisfied with the answers,"" he told BBC News. ""The people were getting frustrated and they walked towards the building. They did not force themselves inside. They got inside the main building and were in the foyer, just speaking."" Police then arrived on the scene and formed a barricade, which Mr Al Mansur said led to ""physical confrontation"" between the two sides. There were then angry scenes outside the Clement James Centre, in North Kensington, where the meeting with the prime minister and residents of the tower had been held. Police surrounded a car outside the church and community centre Dozens of demonstrators surged towards the entrance and there were scuffles outside as organisers appealed for calm. Mrs May had faced criticism for not meeting with survivors in the immediate aftermath, unlike Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn and Mayor of London Sadiq Khan. Fragile government facing huge challenge Asked about the reaction of the crowd, Mrs May defended the government's response. ""What I am now absolutely focused on is ensuring we get that support on the ground,"" she said. This video can not be played Theresa May says Â£5m will be available for survivors, and the cause of the Kensington fire is being looked at ""The government is making money available, we are ensuring we are going to get to the bottom of what has happened, we will ensure that people are re-housed. We need to make sure that actually happens."" Mr Corbyn wrote an open letter to the prime minister, calling for the public inquiry to ensure ""all necessary lessons are learned"". The Labour leader added:  ""[The inquiry] must be empowered to consider all the steps that were, or were not, taken leading up to and contributing to this most terrible incident. ""It must also identify the urgent steps that need to be taken in relation to fire safety standards for other buildings of this nature."" Families appeal for missing relatives Sense of community shines through Requisition houses, urges Corbyn Grenfell Tower wall of condolence - read the tributes Large crowds of people also gathered in Westminster and made their way to Downing Street. The crowd was heard chanting, ""Justice for Grenfell"", along with ""May must go"" and ""blood on your hands"". A peaceful march started making its way down Whitehall and was halted by police outside Downing Street, before moving to Oxford Circus, where demonstrators carried out a sit-down protest. The march continued up Regent Street, where they held a minute's silence outside the BBC's headquarters, and continued towards Marble Arch and Notting Hill, ending at Lancaster Gate. Protesters begin marching from Parliament Square The Â£5m Grenfell Tower Residents' Discretionary Fund, announced by Mrs May, includes the aim to re-house residents within three weeks as close to where they lived before as possible, to pay for temporary housing in the meantime and to provide extra financial assistance. During her meeting with survivors, the PM also said they would be consulted on the terms of the public inquiry announced on Thursday and receive state funding for legal representation. Mrs May said: ""Everyone affected by this tragedy needs reassurance that the government is there for them at this terrible time - and that is what I am determined to provide."" The Queen and Duke of Cambridge also met volunteers, residents and community representatives during a visit to the Westway Sports Centre. The Queen paid tribute to the ""bravery"" of firefighters and the ""incredible generosity"" of volunteers now offering support.

"A man was brought down with a Taser outside the Palace of Westminster after he reached for a knife when approached by officers, Scotland Yard has said. A bearded man, wearing black trousers and a grey sweatshirt, was seen being held against the fence with his arms behind his back by a police officer. Police said the man was arrested on suspicion of possessing a knife. But they ""remain open minded as to whether terrorism was a motive"", they said. The man was held just yards from where PC Keith Palmer was stabbed to death by terrorist Khalid Masood in March. Joe Murphy, London Evening Standard political editor, tweeted: ""There were shouts of 'knife, knife, knife' and man was brought down with a Taser."" BBC deputy political editor John Pienaar said the latest incident ended very swiftly with the man being taken away in a police van. While the gates are closed, the road and pavement opposite remained open and the incident had no effect on traffic in Parliament Square, he said. In a statement, the Metropolitan Police said ""it is too early to understand the motivation"" of the man ""so we have not declared this a terrorist incident"". ""However, given the location, the circumstances and recent tragic events, the MPS Counter Terrorism Command will be investigating this incident. ""We remain open-minded as to whether terrorism was a motive."" Eyewitness Bradley Allen, 19, from Barking, east London, who was walking past Parliament, said he saw a man ""who looked quite angry with fists quite clenched"". ""He stared at me and my mate and we walked past him. Within seconds there was a shout and police ran out of the front gate shouting at him 'Get on the floor, get on the ground'. ""Within seconds he was on the ground - I'm not sure whether he was Tasered - I'm not sure how he got down there, but in seconds it was over. ""Armed police everywhere, telling everyone to move back, and we all got pushed back."" Security around Westminster was tightened following the attack by Masood, who was shot dead after fatally stabbing PC Palmer as he guarded Carriage Gate. A review of security at the perimeter of the parliamentary estate was ordered by Commons Speaker John Bercow following the incident. The use of armed officers and physical barriers have become more visible, while a permanent barrier has been erected to protect pedestrians on Westminster Bridge, where Masood murdered five people and injured more than 50 others by mounting the pavement in a car.

"Mr Trump again calls the Russia investigation a ""witch hunt"" President Donald Trump has appeared to acknowledge he is under investigation in the inquiry into alleged Russian meddling in the US election. In a tweet, the president also seemed to accuse the US deputy attorney general of pursuing a ""Witch Hunt"". He said: ""I am being investigated for firing the FBI Director by the man who told me to fire the FBI Director!"" Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein wrote a memo the White House used to justify the firing of the ex-FBI chief. Mr Rosenstein took over the investigation into whether Russia tried to tip the US election in favour of Mr Trump after Attorney General Jeff Sessions recused himself in March. The deputy attorney generallater appointed Special Counsel Robert Muellerto lead the inquiry. The FBI and Congress are both looking at whether Trump campaign officials colluded with the alleged Kremlin plot. The inquiries have yet to show evidence of collusion. Is Trump closer to obstruction of justice? A legal 'dream team' looking at Trump Russia: The 'cloud' over the White House Who is Robert Mueller? Mr Trump also tweeted on Friday morning: ""After 7 months of investigations & committee hearings about my 'collusion with the Russians,' nobody has been able to show any proof. Sad!"" His tweets come as Mr Trump marks two years since announcing his plan to run for president. When it was first announced a month ago that a special counsel had been appointed to investigate the Trump campaign's links to Russia, the White House issued a restrained statement from the president expressing the hope that the inquiry would be conducted swiftly. But the more a furious president has taken his defence into his own hands, the deeper the waters swirling around him have become. He contradicted the Justice Department over the reasons for sacking the FBI Director, James Comey, telling a TV interviewer that he was fired because of ""this Russia thing"". That in turn led to reports this week that Donald Trump himself was now under investigation by the special counsel, Robert Mueller, for possible obstruction of justice. Mr Trump's latest tweet on Friday morning represented a none-too-veiled attack on the deputy attorney general Rob Rosenstein, who appointed the special counsel. The advice from Mr Trump's family, his legal team and his closest confidantes has been to say nothing and let the special counsel do his work. It's advice that has been spectacularly rejected. In other developments: Mr Rosenstein may have to recuse himself from the Russia investigation if he is called on as a potential witness in the matter, ABC News reports Vice-President Mike Pencehas hired an outside lawyerto handle inquiries into the Trump campaign's potential ties to the Kremlin The Justice Department's special counsel is also investigating President Trump's son-in-law and senior adviser, Jared Kushner, and his business dealings,according to the Washington Post,external Whyis Mr Trump being investigated? Mr Trump was not under investigation before Mr Comey's firing, but reportedly is nowfacing scrutiny for obstruction of justiceover the circumstances surrounding the ex-FBI chief's sacking, according to US media. Special Counsel Mueller was reportedly planning to interview intelligence officials on whether Mr Trump got rid of the FBI director, James Comey, in May to hamper an inquiry into his sacked national security adviser, Michael Flynn. Mr Comey, who had been leading one of several Russia inquiries,testified to Congress last weekthat the president had pressured him to drop an inquiry into links between Mr Flynn and Russia. Mr Flynn was forced out in February after he misled the vice-president about his conversations with Russia's ambassador before Mr Trump took office. This video can not be played Trump says he made the decision to fire Comey - that's not what the White House originally said. The White House has said the president ""has never asked Mr Comey or anyone else to end any investigation, including any investigation involving General Flynn"". Friday's tweet marked the first time Mr Trump has publicly acknowledged he is under investigation. Mr Comey said he was ""sure"" Mr Mueller was looking at whether Mr Trump had obstructed justice, but added that to his knowledge, the president had not tried to impede the Russia inquiry. Mr Trump is unlikely to face criminal prosecution as a sitting president, but obstruction of justice could be grounds for impeachment. Mr Rosenstein's memo was initially used to justify the firing of FBI chief James Comey Though the president did not name Mr Rosenstein in his morning tweet, he appeared to refer to a memo the US deputy attorney general wrote. The memo, which the White House claimed was the impetus for Mr Comey's dismissal, criticised the FBI chief's failure to follow rules and procedures in his handling of an investigation into Hillary Clinton's private email use while Secretary of State. Mr Rosenstein appointed Mr Mueller following growing demands from Democrats to appoint an independent special prosecutor to examine the Russia allegations. It is unlikely the president is referring to Mr Mueller in his tweet because Mr Mueller would not have been in a position to fire Mr Comey.

"Despite occasional differences, Mr Kohl forged alliances with UK Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and US President Ronald Reagan Helmut Kohl, Germany's ex-chancellor and architect of reunification in 1990, has died at 87. Kohl led Germany for 16 years (from 1982 to 1998). He is credited with bringing East and West Germany together after the fall of the Berlin Wall. Together with his French ally President Francois Mitterrand, he was responsible for the introduction of the euro. European Commission chief Jean-Claude Juncker has ordered flags at EU institutions to be flown at half-mast. German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Kohl's former protegee who later called for his resignation over a political funding scandal, said his death filled her with deep sadness. ""Helmut Kohl's efforts brought about the two greatest achievements in German politics of recent decades - German reunification and European unity,"" she said. ""Helmut Kohl understood that the two things were inseparable."" An underrated political giant? Tributes to Kohl from around the world Obituary: Helmut Kohl Helmut Kohl's life in pictures For his part, Mr Juncker said in a tweet: ""Helmut's death hurts me deeply."" ""My mentor, my friend, the very essence of Europe, he will be greatly, greatly missed,"" he added. Former US President George HW Bush paid tribute to the man he knew while in office from 1989 to 1993 as a ""true friend of freedom"" and ""one of the greatest leaders in post-war Europe"". Kohl suffered a bad fall in 2008 and had been using a wheelchair. A piece of the Berlin Wall was erected in Kohl's garden in 2011 as a souvenir He died at his house in Ludwigshafen, in the western state of Rhineland-Palatinate, Bild newspaper reports. Kohl, who led the centre-right Christian Democrats, was the longest-serving chancellor of the 20th Century. A passionate believer in European integration, he persuaded Germans to give up their cherished deutschmark in favour of the European single currency. EU flags are being flown at half-mast In the UK, he is remembered for his differences over the EU with the late UK Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. In France, he is the German leader who held hands with Mitterrand at a service at the Verdun war memorial in 1984 to mark the 70th anniversary of World War One. But for Germans he is above all the man who reunified a country divided by the allied powers after World War Two, promising the people of the ex-communist East ""flourishing landscapes"", in unity with the richer West. Helmut Josef Michael Kohl was born on 3 April 1930 into a conservative, Catholic family. His political outlook was shaped by his experiences in his hometown of Ludwigshafen in the Rhineland during World War Two. Because of its huge chemical works, the town was heavily bombed and, at the age of 12, the young Helmut found himself helping to recover the charred bodies of his neighbours from the rubble. What he once described as ""the blessing of a late birth"" freed him from any taints of Nazism. READ ON Kohl fell from grace when a funding scandal under his leadership of the Christian Democrats came to light after he left office in 1998. Angela Merkel (R) has followed in Kohl's footsteps as a long-serving chancellor Chancellor Merkel first entered government under Kohl's rule in 1991. But she publicly denounced him and called for his resignation when it was revealed the party had received millions of dollars worth of illegal donations using secret bank accounts. In 2011, in a series of interviews and statements, he spoke out against Mrs Merkel's policy of strict austerity to deal with the European debt crisis. Kohl's later life was also marked by personal tragedy. His wife, Hannelore, killed herself in July 2001 after suffering from a rare skin condition and depression.

" US President Donald Trump’s promise to build a ""big, beautiful wall"" between the US and Mexico was a rallying cry throughout his election campaign. As president, Mr Trump has asked for design ideas for the barrier, with a chosen few to be selected this month for a prototype showcase this summer in San Diego, California. Mr Trump says he wants a wall along half the 2,000-mile (3,100km) border - with nature, such as mountains and rivers, helping to take care of the rest. However, the route crosses difficult terrain, is home to a lot of wildlife and cuts across land owned by Native American tribes as well as private citizens. So is building the wall actually possible? Here are some of the obstacles Mr Trump will have to overcome. As it runs from San Diego, California, in the west, to Brownsville, Texas, in the east, it changes from relatively straight lines to following the windy path of the Rio Grande. In fact, the actual border is, in many places, defined as the deepest channel of the river. Building a wall in the middle of the Rio Grande would be challenging for obvious reasons, but there are also legal issues. A treatysigned by Mexico and the US in 1889prevents any disruption to the flow of the river, meaning any border wall would probably have to be built on its banks. This, again, presents obvious problems. Existing border fencing often sits far from the river, outside its floodplains, leaving a wide gap between the fence and the official border. This means some US citizens have been forced to live on the Mexican side of the fence in a kind of limbo between the two countries. While two thirds of its length runs along rivers, the southern US border also bisects other challenging environments - desert in California and Arizona and mountains in New Mexico. In eastern California, there are the Algodones - or Imperial Sand Dunes - the largest sand dune ecosystem in the US. There is already a section of “floating fence” here, specifically engineered to work with the shifting sands, installed by the George W Bush administration. Meanwhile, Arizona and New Mexico are mountainous. Coronado National Forest, in southeastern Arizona and southwestern New Mexico, has several 9,000-ft peaks. A wall appears impossible here. The US-Mexico border hasa delicate ecosystemthat could be disrupted by any new barrier. A wall would prevent animals reaching their hunting lands, water sources and migration corridors. Grey wolves and jaguars hunt on both sides of the border. Other cross-border populations of wildlife include bison, bighorn sheep, ocelots and bears. Splitting these animals will not only decrease genetic diversity but also make species susceptible to diseases and epidemics, conservationists have warned. Protecting the wildlife along 12% of the US-Mexico border is the task of Big Bend National Park in West Texas, home to thousands of species, including more types of birds, bats, and cacti than any other national park in the US. Staff there are concerned that any barrier would impact greatly on their mission to protect the Chihuahuan Desert’s ecosystem for future generations and jeopardise relationships with colleagues working on the other side of the Rio Grande. Jennette Jurado, Big Bend public information officer and ranger, says this collaboration with Mexican neighbours is crucial to her conservation work. “I think if you look at this place from the air, you wouldn’t notice that a political divide went down the middle of that river because the ecosystem is whole and protected,” she says, “but it takes two nations to do so.” Mike Davidson, a guide at Big Bend, agrees that cooperation has been crucial to wildlife protection and says building a wall or other structure would be “really sad”, detracting from people’s desire to come to Big Bend. “Why come down here when there’s a big blank wall instead of these beautiful canyons?” Mr Trump’s initial price tag of between $8bn and $12bn (£6.4bn and £9.7bn) has been widely disputed. The 650 miles of fencing built under President George W Bush cost an estimated $7bn, and it could not be described as fulfilling Mr Trump's promises of a ""tall, powerful, beautiful"" barrier. A number of very different estimates have been put forward by other official bodies. Mitch McConnell, the Republican majority leader in the Senate, stated the cost would be between $12bn and $15bn, while a report by the US Department for Homeland Security estimated the wallwould cost between $21.6bn and $25bn. Meanwhile, a report by Senate Democrats, said the wallcould cost nearly $70bn to build and $150m a year to maintain. Other, unofficial, estimates have varied. Wall Street research and brokerage firm Bernstein Research said the price tag could be between$15bn and $25bn, while construction consultants Gleeds believe it would bein the region of $31bn. Meanwhile, Konstantin Kakaes, an international security fellow with the New America Foundation writing in the MIT Technology Review, saidthe total could reach $40bn. One thing’s for sure, it’s going to be expensive, and so far, the cash hasn’t been found. In his proposed budget unveiled in March, Mr Trump allocated $1.4bn for wall construction in the ongoing fiscal year, with another $2.6bn for the 2018 budget year starting on 1 October. However, Congress didn’t approve any funding for wall construction this year (only cash for repairs to 40 miles of older fencing) and Mr Trump has now reduced his request to $1.6bn - down £1bn - for 2018. An additional $1bn is allotted to border “technology and infrastructure”. According to the Department of Homeland Security,the £1.6bn would be spent on 74 miles of barrier, mostly in the Rio Grande Valley. While Mr Trump originally promised to build a wall along the whole 2,000-mile border, he later clarified that it would only cover 1,000 miles due to “natural barriers”. As for height, he has given estimates ranging between 30ft and 50ft. In March, the Department of Homeland Security and Customs and Border Protection clarified the government’s requirements. In addition to the complex structural work, there is the surveying, land acquisition and access road-building, among other things, he says. Inviting companies to submit designs, theFedBizOpps.govwebsite stated the “cost-effective” structure must be made of reinforced concrete and: New York-based structural engineer Alex Weinberg told the BBC that a wall, “even one of this size”, was not difficult in terms of engineering because there was “nothing to engineer”. Instead, the “big task” would be the scale of the operation. “It’s the logistics that are the real challenge here,” he said. Land would need to be surveyed and acquired, foundations dug and construction materials made. On top of this, because of the remote location of much of the construction site, access roads would need to be built and supplies, accommodation, transport and medical care would need to be provided for the required large labour force. “It’s going to be a slog,” Mr Weinberg said. However, the government, alongside its call for concrete wall designs, has asked for submissions for a “see-through component/capability” that “facilitates situational awareness”. This appears to suggest that the government is considering building out of materials other than concrete - something Homeland Security Secretary John F Kelly, a retired general, alsotold senators on the Homeland Security Committee this month. “It is unlikely that we will build a wall from sea to shining sea,” he said. However, he added that physical barriers would be ""put in the right places"" and that sensors, drones and other technology would fill in gaps where a wall would not be present. In order to build the wall, the government needs permission to use the land it stands on. However, about66% of landalong the US-Mexico border is either owned privately, by Native Americans or by individual states. In these cases, the government will need to coordinate mass voluntary sales of property or negotiate a right of way for the wall along large swaths of land. Thousands of homeowners could be affected, includingranchers in Texas- among them Donald Trump supporters - who rely on access to the Rio Grande and pastures for their livestock. Trying to purchase this land could be a major challenge and if people refuse, the government would have to forcibly get hold of it. Welcome to the term ""eminent domain"". Eminent domain is a system used to gain ownership of private property for public use, such as for highways and railroads, usually accompanied by compensation. It has been used for the construction of border fences in the past. Gerald S Dickinson, assistant professor of law at the University of Pittsburgh Law School, haswarned that such eminent domain fights could take years. Any federal eminent domain action on such a large scale against even a few landowners could trigger “decades of court disputes before anything is built”, he told the Washington Post. In the 2000s, the Bush administration had to negotiate land purchases with hundreds of landowners. Many citizens and local governments mounted resistance, causing major delays. Among them was a family who lost half their farmland and their house and are now forced to live on the Mexican side of the fence, only accessing the US side via a locked gate into which they have to punch in a passcode. Democratic Senator Claire McCaskilltold the Senate Homeland Security Committeethat out of 400 land acquisitions needed for the fencing that currently exists, 330 lawsuits were filed by the Department of Justice and more than 90 of those cases were still pending. However, some landowners are receptive to the current administration’s moves. The Villareal family, whose property lies just outside Rio Grande City, Texas, and borders the river, say they now feel better protected under President Trump because of his hardline approach to immigration. “I do feel safer,“ says Daniel Villareal. “I mean, we've always come down here [to the river] armed, ever since we're sort of having the problem [of illegal immigrants crossing their land]. “But now that the situation's different, and there's not that many people trying to come across, maybe we can come down here, clear this area and then have our riverbank.” The family was approached by the Bush administration when it was researching areas to build a fence, but nothing came of it. Rene Villareal, Daniel’s brother, says the family would not oppose plans for a wall across their property if it helped prevent more people crossing the border illegally in the short term. “I want the wall because it's not going to be permanent,” says Rene. “It's not going to be forever into eternity. It's just until people come to their senses.” But, while some private property-owners may not object, the proprietors of Tribal lands have already voiced firm opposition. The Tohono O’odham Nation owns much of such land, including a reservation that extends along 75 miles of the border in Arizona. Tribe members still live on both sides of the border, considering the territory their ancestral lands, and haveindicated they will attempt to block construction if the wall goes ahead. Should that happen, Mr Trump would need a bill from Congress to acquire the land, which is currently protected under law. As many have pointed out, a strip of concrete stretching across the continent would not keep people out indefinitely unless it is manned by border guards. Homeland Security secretary, John F Kelly, has himself said that a“physical barrier will not do the job”and that you would have to back it up with patrolling human beings, sensors and observation devices. In executive orders issued five days after his inauguration, Trump called for the recruitment of an extra 5,000 Border Patrol agents and 10,000 immigration officers, but budget requests so far would only pay for 500 border agents and 1,000 immigration officers. Marlene Castro, supervisory border patrol agent in the Rio Grande Valley sector, believes adequate staffing is part of the package of measures needed to secure the border. “You can have all the technology and infrastructure, but if you don’t have the personnel to respond efficiently and effectively then it becomes useless,” she says. Ms Castro has seen the number of illegal crossings in her area go down since Donald Trump was elected, but at the same time, she and her fellow agents have experienced a rise in assaults against them. She puts this down to the frustration felt by those enabling illegal entry into the US. “The smugglers are pretty desperate right now… of course this is just an assumption, I can’t speak for a smuggler, but I’m thinking they’re losing a lot of money because of the lack of people coming across.” One of those people smugglers, known locally as “The Horse”, says his business was impacted by the Bush administration’s fence and that a bigger wall would “complicate” the people-smuggling trade further. However, he warns that the Mexican mafia “will always try to find a way to cross” and that prices would simply increase. Tony Estrada, Arizona’s Santa Cruz County sheriff, agrees that people will still find a way through. “No wall, no matter how beautiful, how big or how expensive is going to stop people that are desperate, people that are needy and people that are poor. “These people are coming from thousands and thousands of miles at great expense and in great danger. They have been victimised most of the way. Do you think a wall is gonna stop them? No, it’s just going to be another obstacle.” Sealing off the border would also affect the economies of border towns and affect the wider US-Mexican economy - something many US politicians would be keen to avoid. Communities along the US side of the border have developed close and dependant economic relationships with their sister cities in Mexico. Many Mexican towns are home to US factories employing thousands of people and Mexican shoppers spend billions of dollars in US border states every year. The supply of cheap labour in Mexico has also fuelled the rise of manufacturing plants - known as maquiladora - along the border. These maquiladoras - or maquilas, for short - enjoy tax breaks and produce and export goods, a legacy of the North American Free Trade Agreement which came into force in 1994, scrapping many tariffs between the US, Canada and Mexico. The wall could also impact on the wider US-Mexico economic relationship too. Mexico is America’s second largest export market and America is Mexico’s largest. The two countries have a “very deep” economic relationship, explains Christopher Wilson, deputy director of the Mexico Institute at the think-tank the Wilson Center, with five million US jobs depending on it. The Wilson Center’s research suggests that if trade between the US and Mexico were halted, 4.9 million Americans would be out of work. The two economies are now so interconnected, Mr Wilson says, that they no longer just sell finished products to each other, but instead “actually build products together”. “Parts are moved across the border, sometime multiple times in the course of production,” he says. “Both the United States and Mexico are contributing to the value of products that are ultimately sold in the region or exported to the rest of the world.” Research by the Wilson Center suggests that half of all US-Mexico trade is made up of this movement of parts and materials. “At the deepest level, we’re in it together,” Mr Wilson says. Truck driver Jose Antonio Garcia Fuentes, living in Nuevo Laredo, Mexico, knows very well how much the two sides of the border rely on each other. President of a company of 50 truck drivers, Jose crosses the border every week and worries about the changes a new barrier would bring. “Imagine if there are 14,000 trucks crossing every day here and then 4,000,” he says. “There would be truck drivers here without work.” He also points out that moving jobs and manufacturing businesses back into the US, as President Trump has promised, could have a detrimental impact on both countries. “The labour is more expensive [in the US]. They pay US$14 an hour to a worker. With that you can pay three Mexicans,” he says. “That is why it's very difficult to break the commercial links between Mexico and the US, the US saves [money] here in Mexico. That's what is at risk.” Field reporting, video journalism and photography by Paul Harris and Kelvin Brown. Words and production by Lucy Rodgers. Data journalism and production by Nassos Stylianou.

"The claim:Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn says the government should requisition housing if necessary for those made homeless by the Grenfell Tower fire. Reality Check verdict:Doing so would not be allowed under current rules, and legislation to allow property to be seized in peacetime would be controversial. Labour leaderJeremy Corbyn said:""It cannot be acceptable that in London you have luxury buildings and luxury flats kept as land banking for the future while the homeless and the poor look for somewhere to live."" Mr Corbyn's spokesman was asked about the legality of this and said: ""We would find a way to do this if necessary - we are looking into the ways in which it could be done depending on circumstances."" The obvious example of governments forcing owners to allow their properties to be used was during the two World Wars. Many stately homes were requisitioned as part of the war effort. Bletchley Park, where crucial code-breaking was carried out, was bought privately before the war, but requisition was later used to extend the site. Land around Bletchley Park was requisitioned as part of the war effort The government had to pass legislation in order to do that - the Defence of the Realm Act in 1914 and the Emergency Powers Act in 1939 - but this does not appear to have happened in peacetime to meet emergency housing needs. ""Any property requisitions may therefore require emergency legislation in Parliament to instigate and would probably prove controversial,"" said Mark Woloshak, a lawyer from Slater and Gordon. Local authorities do have the power to force someone to sell their land, using something called a compulsory purchase order (CPO). These are used when there is a strong public interest justification, in order to ""deliver social, environmental and economic change"", according togovernment guidance,external. For example, if land or buildings are empty, they might be compulsorily purchased in order to redevelop housing estates or to build a public road. The owner will be compensated. However, doing this with empty luxury flats would be extremely expensive. Also,research from the London School of Economics,externalrecently found ""almost no evidence of units being left entirely empty - certainly less than 1%"", but that ""for those units bought as second homes, occupancy could be as little as a few weeks a year"". And there are questions as to whether the exercise of this power in the context Mr Corbyn refers to would be lawful. ""It wouldn't stand in the courtsâ¦ it would be a breach of the purpose that legislation is for,"" said lawyer Chad Sutton from Planning Clarity Legal. Acquiring land through a compulsory purchase order is also not a quick process, often taking up to two years before public bodies can get access to the land, so this would not be a quick fix to rehouse displaced people in the short term. CPOs are intended as a last resort after the authorities have attempted to negotiate with the landowners. There are currently no powers available to force an owner to rent out their property if it is vacant. Local authorities have access to use Empty Dwelling Management Orders, but those are designed to allow local authorities to step in when empty properties have become targets for vandalism or a blight on the neighbourhood. There are restrictions on their use that would prevent them applying to luxury flats in good condition, even if they were empty. So, to provide emergency housing in the current circumstance, the government would need legislation either to allow requisitions or the use of CPOs.

"A boosted youth vote is believed to have contributed to Labour's shock election result, but what made young people turn out to vote? In 2015, voter turnout among 18- to 24-year-olds was estimated to be43%, compared with a 66.1% turnout overall,external. This year,YouGov,externalputs the youth turnout at 58%. Polling traditionally shows that a majority of young people vote Labour.  This year, the proportion has jumped to 63% for 18-29-year-olds, according toYouGov,external. So how did this change happen? Sam Jeffers, co-founder ofWho Targets Me,external, which monitored the use of social media adverts by the political parties during the general election, said it seemed clear that Labour defeated the Conservatives in the social media battle. Labour's adverts had consistently been shared more widely by social media users, he said. Part of this appears to be down to the difference in tone of the adverts. While the Conservatives had almost entirely focused their adverts on the strength of Prime Minister Theresa May and the weakness of Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, Labour's social media adverts had been more positive, seeking to emphasise that the party was building a social movement, he said. And this had been combined with the repeated use of adverts with practical messages designed to increase youth voter turnout by giving instructions on how to register to vote and where to find local polling stations. Many of Labour's adverts had practical messages on things such as finding local polling stations Adverts also appeared to have been released on specific days on the basis that their message was likely to cut through for only a limited amount of time, Mr Jeffers said. For example, Labour had invested heavily on adverts attacking the Tories' so-called ""dementia tax"" on social care costs, days before the 8 June election. The aim of this appeared to be to suppress the older, potentially Conservative, vote or get them to switch to Labour at the last minute, Mr Jeffers said. Labour also focused its attention on more of the UK, targeting 464 constituencies in the final two days of the election campaign. The Tories targeted 205. Was it Facebook wot swung it? While the Labour Party paid for targeted adverts on social media, Momentum - the group that was set up to support Mr Corbyn's leadership bid and now campaigns for Labour - had a different social media strategy. Rather than pay for advertising, it instead sought to create content it hoped social media users would share voluntarily. The group created videos - many of them parodies - it hoped would become viral. These included Daddy, why do you hate me? - a mock political broadcast telling people to vote for Theresa May ""because your children deserve worse"" - which Momentum says has been viewed more than 7.6 million times across social media platforms. Many of Momentum's videos show Jeremy Corbyn embracing his supporters Its Facebook and Twitter pages feature a mixture of content, from posts mocking Theresa May's record to videos of Mr Corbyn hugging some of his supporters. Joe Todd, from Momentum, said the group had felt its strategy was working when it had realised many of the people sharing its content were not typical supporters of Mr Corbyn. Increasingly, users liking its Facebook page had been people who also liked the pages of TV programmes not known for their political audiences, such as Ant and Dec's Saturday Night Takeaway and Match of the Day, he said. ""We were breaking out of the leftie bubble,"" Mr Todd said. Using message services to reach the young - and in some cases mobilising them into an army of potential canvassers - had been important in reaching the youth vote, Mr Todd said. Momentum says it reached some 400,000 people through the messaging platform WhatsApp, whichdata shows,externalis used most by 18-to 29-year-olds, in the UK. The group also set up mynearestmarginal.com - a website that enables activists to pool together, and often lift share, to canvass in marginal seats. Momentum says the website was used by about 100,000 people - more than four times as many as its 24,000 membership. This meant young people with no experience of canvassing could team up with those with previous election experience for targeted canvassing. ""If you have a young person telling another young person, 'You should get out and vote because this election is important', it's more convincing,"" Mr Todd said. There was also an unashamed pitch for the youth vote at the heart of Labour's manifestoFor the Many, Not the Few,external- and that was the eye-catching promise of scrapping tuition fees for university students and the pledge to reintroduce their maintenance grants. Further policies pitched with the young in mind included the ending of zero-hour contracts and unpaid internships, a rise in the minimum wage, and a pledge to build more than one million homes. Of course, Labour wasn't the only party that targeted young people and it's hard to quantify the effect of the manifesto in getting the young out to vote, but Mr Todd felt it was among the most significant factors. ""It conjured up a sense of hope,"" he said. The Labour campaign also featured large rallies that accompanied Jeremy Corbyn's speeches around the country. Mr Corbyn had been a long-standing supporter of the protest movement, and the veteran anti-war campaigner was well placed to appeal to a growing number of young people who had become engaged in politics through these movements, according to Sam Fairbairn, national secretary of the People's Assembly protest group. Although the People's Assembly does not endorse individual parties or candidates, Mr Fairbairn said the group - and its numerous local affiliates and sister organisations - had encouraged members to join Mr Corbyn's campaign rallies. ""It's no accident Jeremy has been part of these movements since he's been in politics. This is how many young people have got into politics in the last 10 years,"" Mr Fairbairn said. ""What we saw was the result of the work all these movements have done."" Young people have increasingly taken part in political protests A string of endorsements from anti-establishment celebrities and musicians, including from the world of grime - a genre of music that blends garage and jungle and  has a Jamaican influence - also, arguably, further bolstered Mr Corbyn's youth credentials. Mr Corbyn also took part in interviews with outlets - such as rock magazines NME and Kerrang, and football YouTube channel Copa90 - outside of the political mainstream that were more likely to reach younger audiences. Becka Hudson, from the #Grime4Corbyn campaign, told the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme Mr Corbyn had ""offered young people a programme they can believe in and a better future"".

Is there the danger the young will be discouraged by the election result and be less likely to turn out at the next election, whenever that may be? Mr Todd thinks the opposite is the case.

"This video can not be played Ebola nurse Pauline Cafferkey: The Western world has moved on Scottish nurse Pauline Cafferkey has returned to Sierra Leone for the first time since contracting Ebola there in 2014. She went back to fundraise for children orphaned by the epidemic and to close a chapter of her life. The last time Mbalu met Pauline, the teenager was sick with Ebola and fighting for her life. Pauline cared for her while smothered in a personal protection equipment suit (PPE), when working amidst the crisis gripping the country. The nursing staff had their names written on their suits, so they could identify one another and it is for that reason, and not Pauline's face, that Mbalu, now 17, remembers her. ""The first time I saw Pauline, she looked like a devil,"" Mbalu says, referring to the PPE suit. Now the former patient and her nurse meet again, in an Ebola-free Sierra Leone, at Mbalu's small blue house near Kerry Town, found down a pockmarked dirt road. ""It's lovely to meet one of the survivors,"" Pauline tells theBBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme. ""Mbalu must be so resilient. She has so much inspiration that she wants to fulfil. ""Coming here and meeting a survivor is important to me. I wouldn't even start to think about the mental health issues that everyone has gone through post-Ebola and during it as well. ""There's no way I can compare what I've gone through to what they've gone through."" Mbalu says that after being cared for by Pauline Cafferkey, she too wants to be a nurse Many children in Sierra Leone were left orphaned by the Ebola epidemic When they're reunited, the pair laugh and banter like old friends, holding hands and cuddling one another. During the epidemic, that kind of physical contact infected about 14,000 people and proved deadly to 4,000. Ebola killed Mbalu's father and sister - the family breadwinners - along with her niece and aunt. She has not been to school for two years, instead finding whatever work she can to feed her family. ""I want to be a nurse. Now I want to help others. I see Pauline as a hero, because she risked her life to come to our aid. She has courage."" The outbreak of Ebola in Sierra Leone left some 12,000 children orphaned, and 1,400 are currently identified by the charity as being at serious risk of extreme poverty, malnutrition and abuse. During her trip, which she funded herself, Pauline also visited the site of the Ebola treatment centre in Kerry Town, quickly erected by the Royal Engineers as the disease spread. It is here that she and her colleagues cared for the sick and dying, and it's where she contracted Ebola. The Kerry Town centre has been demolished to make way for a hospital Some houses in remote villages have been abandoned after their occupants died of Ebloa But when she arrives at the former treatment centre, the large site is nothing but rubble. The buildings were demolished only a few days earlier, to make way for a hospital. She calmly walks around, trying to get her bearings and reflecting on what it was like to work there, wrapped in plastic suits in stifling temperatures and cloying humidity. ""The wards seemed quite sombre at times. The only real happiness was when the survivors were coming out and the local staff would do a happy dance for them. ""It was good just to see it destroyed. It's a place that doesn't hold good memories for many, many people."" Pauline fell ill shortly after she returned to the UK and was later charged with misconduct by the Nursing and Midwifery Council for allegedly allowing a wrong temperature to be recorded in the screening process on her arrival at Heathrow. Although she was cleared,fighting her case stripped her of her life's savings. Pauline ran despite having a weak leg and sore joints as a result of her Ebola Pauline ran the marathon's 10k section, which she says was among the highlights of her trip For the next part of her trip, Pauline travels to Makeni, a large town in the centre of the country. Pauline has returned to Sierra Leone with the charity Street Child, to participate in the UK-based charity's annual marathon. This year's event saw 600 locals and 170 runners from overseas take part. It's here the ""the craziest marathon in the world,"" passes over dirt roads, winding through tropical forests and into remote villages. Pauline has had many health problems as a result of her Ebola, including pain in her legs and numbness in her feet. Despite this, she paid to enter the 10k part of the run, launching an Everyday Hero fundraising page which currently stands at Â£2,600. Isetu looks after her granddaughter Mariama and her seven siblings Pauline also met Mabinty, an 18-year-old who looks after her baby and siblings She had thought she would need to walk it but gets ""caught up in the moment"" and runs. ""It was great that the community was out encouraging us, pushing us along. It was probably the highlight of the trip,"" she says. For the remainder of her days in Sierra Leone, she visits more charity projects, sitting down with 12-year-old Mariama, a girl who is being cared for - along with her seven siblings - by her grandmother, after losing her parents to Ebola. Mariama is very shy, but delights Pauline when she murmurs how she'd like to be president of Sierra Leone one day. Pauline says she feels some dissatisfaction with the situation in the country. ""I feel frustrated that the Western world has moved on. They've pulled out, the media's pulled out, most of the aid agencies have pulled out. These people are still living with the aftermath."" But Pauline is, at least, feeling upbeat about her own prospects. ""I'm not too sure what the future is going to hold. I'm pretty positive it's going to be something good. ""I'm due something good to happen in my life. I've just got to wait for it."" Watch theVictoria Derbyshire programmeon weekdays between 09:00 and 11:00 BST on BBC Two and the BBC News Channel.

"Dennis Rodman, bearing gifts What do you give the man who has an entire country at his mercy? When former US pro-basketball star and all-round character Dennis Rodman met with North Korea's sports minister this week he took along gifts for the country's authoritarian leader, Kim Jong-un. Mr Rodman has in recent years forged an unlikely friendship with Mr Kim, a big basketball fan who is alleged to have executed hundreds of people, including close family members, to cement his authority. The North Korean leader reportedly lives a hugely extravagant life, paid for with vast funds from the state coffers. All in all, a tricky man to shop for. Here's what Mr Rodman bought the man he called his ""friend for life"". Gift one was President Donald Trump's 1987 ghostwritten bestseller The Art of the Deal, a guidebook on how to negotiate some of the best deals. The copy wasn't signed by the author. Or Mr Trump. Mr Kim has at his disposal ways and means of negotiating which would be unpalatable even to a New York real estate developer. In fact, the North Korean leader, who occupies a semi-religious position in the country's political firmament, and whose every word is taken down in real time by a cadre of notebook-carrying assistants, probably has very little call to do any effective negotiating at all. Gift number two: a copy of Where's Waldo. A seemingly bizarre gift for a world leader. Then again, could this somehow allow Mr Kim to practise for when he needs to pick a friend out of the crowd? Mr Kim and Mr Rodman watch basketball in 2013, in front of crowd As for buying him the Totally Essential Travel Collection, Mr Kim has no known friendships with foreign leaders and rarely - if ever - leaves the country. Mr Rodman famously married himself in a public stunt, so we know he has a sense of humour. The children's book Where's Waldo? is published in the UK as Where's Wally? Mr Kim is known to be a big fan of basketball, despite his singular dislike for the country that made the sport famous. He is said to have inherited the eccentric obsession from his father, the supreme leader, Kim Jong-il. In a failed diplomatic effort in 2000, then-US Secretary of State Madeleine Albright presented the elder Kim with a ball signed by Michael Jordan. Mr Rodman poses with North Korean basketball players During a visit in 2014, Mr Rodman played - and sensibly lost - an exhibition game against a Korean side in honour of Mr Kim's birthday. He also sung him happy birthday from the court. This is probably the most sane gift of the lot. Both the Rodman camp and the Trump administration have said publicly that Mr Rodman is not travelling on state-sanctioned 'basketball diplomacy'. So either they're both lying, and the mermaid puzzle, ingeniously, once completed, carries a coded message, or they're telling the truth, and one of Dennis Rodman's gifts to the leader of North Korea was a mermaid puzzle. So he panicked and grabbed a couple of things at the airport - you've never done that? How harsh is prison in North Korea?

"Cristiano Ronaldo will be one of the big names at the Confederations Cup In Russia, football fever is slowly rising. The Confederations Cup kicks off this weekend in St Petersburg. For fans, the fortnight of international football is a taster for the 2018 World Cup. But for Russia, plagued by image problems, the championship is also chance to prove that it is a safe host for travelling players and their supporters. That is not how it looked last summer. Russian hooligans were among those rampaging through the streets of France at the European Championship. The internet was flooded with phone footage of gangs, chasing and dishing out brutal beatings to rival fans. Russian fans were blamed for violence in Marseille and in Lille at Euro 2016 There have been fears ever since that Russian hooligans will try to repeat those scenes on home turf. Officials here are adamant that will not happen. ""We are working with fans, analysing potential threats,"" senior interior ministry official Anton Gusev explained at a press conference to present security plans both for this summer and the 2018 World Cup. He revealed that 191 Russians were currently blacklisted and banned from matches. That is almost double the number before the trouble in Marseille. This video can not be played Members of the Orel Butchers speak to the BBC about their lives as football hooligans ""Those convicted of serious violations including racism, setting off flares or fights are under our constant control,"" the security chief stressed, adding that his team were also working closely with police abroad. Refs can stop games over fan abuse - Fifa What Russian fans said about Euro 2016 violence At the heart of Russia's security arrangements is a new ""fan passport"" system. On the ground floor of a Moscow city office block, staff are still busy creating the laminated photo IDs required by all ticket holders for the Confederations Cup. It is one of multiple distribution centres issuing the passports to all applicants who pass security screening. For travelling fans, the ID also replaces a visa. ""After checks like this, I think it will be very safe,"" Andrei told the BBC, plastic ID already in hand. He said he had won two match tickets at work and was not at all worried about security. ""Russia is not France. Everything will be great!"" Andrei added. ""If there are idiot hooligans here, then they exist all over the world. But I think people will see this as a party, not as an excuse to come and fight,"" another fan called Ramil agreed. With matches in four host cities, instead of the 11 being made ready for 2018, the Confederations Cup is a chance to test-drive the new IDs on a smaller scale. But hooligans are not the only security concern. It is just over two months since a suicide bomber attacked the metro in St Petersburg, the venue for the opening match on Saturday. There have been further terror attacks in Europe since then. President Vladimir Putin has issued a decree tightening security for several weeks in the four host cities. Decree 202 sets restrictions on access and activities in those cities. Controversially, that includes extra curbs on political demonstrations. Officers policing the Confederations Cup also need accreditation ""Currently, we have the situation totally under control, we don't see any terror threat,"" a deputy head of the FSB intelligence service told the BBC. ""We are increasing our work on all fronts: both inside the country and by co-operating with all foreign partners who are ready to help,"" said Alexei Lavrishchev. In the kind of dig at the West that is common these days he added that Russia's borders were closed to members of international terror groups, ""unlike European countries with a more liberal migration regime"". The man blamed for the St Petersburg bombing was a Russian citizen, though. Hosting the World Cup, and its precursor this month, is a matter of great pride for Russia. But the event has thrust the country under an international spotlight that it is not always happy about. A common reaction to criticism, including over hooliganism, has been to claim that Russia is the victim of a smear campaign. Russia's enemies, the argument goes, are trying to sabotage the World Cup. But behind the bluster, officials do seem to have taken note. Not so long ago, Alexei Smertin claimed there was no such thing as racism in Russian football. The former Chelsea midfielder and national team captain has since been made a World Cup ambassador, given the task of rooting out racism amongst other things. Racism 'does not exist' in Russia, says Smertin ""It's an issue that exists everywhere,"" Mr Smertin told the BBC, while Russia's national squad trained behind him for their opening game. ""But we will show our warm reception for all, despite their continent or nationality."" Russian football's anti-racism inspector Alexei Smertin once denied the problem existed there Anti-racism campaigners reported a significant rise in abusive chanting in 2014-15, the last season they had figures for. But Alexei Smertin said Russia's slogan was ""respect"". He also insisted his country was taking the problem of hooliganism seriously. ""I would say there is this tiny minority of people who areâ¦ a bit aggressive,"" the ex-Chelsea player conceded. ""But 99% of people who love football are quite polite."" That is the message that Russia is working hard to project. As fans arrive for this weekend's first matches, it will have to starting proving itself.

"Think of New Zealand and what likely comes to mind is beautiful nature - fjords, mountains and magnificent landscapes, vast, empty and endless. But for years already, the country has been struggling with another form of isolation - depression and suicide. A newreport by Unicef,externalcontains a shocking statistic - New Zealand has by far the highest youth suicide rate in the developed world. A shock but no surprise - it's not the first time the country tops that table. The Unicef report found New Zealand's youth suicide rate - teenagers between 15 and 19 - to be the highest of a long list of 41 OECD and EU countries. The rate of 15.6 suicides per 100,000 people is twice as high as the US rate and almost five times that of Britain. There's a combination of reasons, and it's important not to only focus on one statistic, warns Dr Prudence Stone of Unicef New Zealand. The high suicide rate ties in with other data, showing for instance child poverty, high rates of teenage pregnancies or families where neither of the parents have work. New Zealand also has ""one of the world's worst records for bullying in school"", says Shaun Robinson of the Mental Health Foundations New Zealand. He explains there is a ""toxic mix"" of very high rates of family violence, child abuse and child poverty that need to be addressed to tackle the problem. Many New Zealanders live in remote rural communities New Zealand's own statistics also reveal that suicide rates are highest for young Maori and Pacific Islander men. ""This shows us there are also issues around cultural identity and the impact of colonisation,"" he says. According to the most recent data of 2014, the suicide rate among Maori men across all age groups is around 1.4 times that of the non-Maori. ""It is alarming to see - and perhaps it is an indicator of the level of institutional and cultural racism in our society,"" says Dr Stone. ""There is no research for us to say that conclusively but it certainly suggests as much."" Could the country's tough rugby culture be adding to pressure on teenage boys? Beyond the bleak numbers there's another possibility that some cite as a possible cause for the troubling situation. Health and support services across all Western countries have for years been fighting the stigma attached to depression perceived as weakness. And this might in fact be more of a problem in New Zealand than in other countries. ""There is a tradition of the hardened-up mate culture within New Zealand,"" says Dr Stone. ""It puts pressure on men to be of a particular mould, pressure on boys to harden up to become these tough beer-drinking hard men. "" She says there's been a slight change in recent years, with musicians and film makers emerging as role models for a different kind of New Zealand male - people that are ""not your typical All Black big tough type"" but show there can be a playful approach to masculinity. Phone helplines can often offer life-saving support ""A lot of the Western world does really take an attitude: 'I'm just gonna grin and bear it,'"" agrees Briana Hill, spokeswoman for Youthline, a phone helpline specifically aimed at young people. ""But I think there definitely is an added stoicism in the New Zealand psyche around 'I'm just gonna work through this myself' which you might not experience as much in other countries."" It's not that there's no support system to address the issue but the problem is that it's completely over-stretched. Demand for services has shot up by 70% over the past decade, explains Mr Robinson, while the number of suicide-related callouts by police have gone up by 30% in the past four years alone. It is a problem that Briana Hill of Youthline is only too familiar with. There are too many calls that they are simply not able to take, she says, because they don't have the capacity. Youthline's counsellors are a mix of professionals and volunteers The unanimous sense among the expert community is that there needs to be more funding to help the services that address the problem. But equally important is a more general focus to create awareness of the problem and to prioritise it. ""The country is not doing a good job of supporting its young people to be able to manage the pressure, the stresses, the emotional and mental challenges that they are facing,"" says Shaun Robinson. The persistence of the problem, though, over the years has already pushed it higher up the agenda of policy makers. It has, for instance, become a topic in political debates ahead of the country's general election in September this year. In April, the government published a draft for a national suicide prevention strategy which currentlyis up for public consultation,external. While there is a lot of debate around the draft, even those who say it falls short agree that it's an important step towards shifting the country's sky-high suicide rates more into the public focus.

"This video can not be played Angry protesters stormed Kensington Town Hall, demanding answers Protests were held in London as residents demanded support for those affected by the Grenfell Tower fire. Between 50 and 60 people stormed Kensington and Chelsea Town Hall as members of the public said the homeless needed help ""right now"". Crowds gathered outside a hall where PM Theresa May met survivors and protests were also held at Downing Street. Mrs May sanctioned Â£5m for clothes, food and emergency supplies, as the death toll rose to at least 30. The BBC understands those missing could number about 70, with the 30 likely to be among that number. Three of those who diedhave been identified. There was nothing to suggest the fire was started deliberately, police said. Between 50 and 60 protesters rushed into the council building Hundreds of mourners stood arm in arm at a vigil and held a two-minute silence for victims of the fire. Many wept openly as candles illuminated the road outside the Latymer Christian Centre, yards from the site of the blaze. The fire broke out shortly before 01:00 BST on Wednesday. It tore through all floors of the building and took more than 200 firefighters 24 hours to bring it under control. Mahad Egal, who escaped his fourth floor flat with his family, said: ""At first it seemed it was controllable, but really quickly the fire started to rise as the cladding caught fire. It is incredible we survived."" Emergency services spent a third day searching for bodies in the burnt-out Grenfell Tower in North Kensington. A vigil has been set up near to the site of the disaster Hundreds gathered arm in arm and raised candles as they observed a two-minute silence This video can not be played An angry crowd chanted to Theresa May: ""Shame on you!"" The first protest began at around 15:00 at the town hall and scores later joined it. At about 16:30, people began to rush up the steps and make their way into the building. One member of the public said: ""Nobody knows what is happening. People are so angry. Those people shouldn't be sleeping in the street."" Mustafa Al Mansur, who organised the protest, read a statement from the council which promised to re-house as many people locally as they could and to provide funding for those affected. But he called the response ""flimsy"" with ""no concrete answers"" - especially on the question of number of residents who lived in the flats. Latest updates: Death toll expected to rise What we know so far 'The working class aren't being listened to' How one Grenfell Tower resident escaped May faces criticism over Grenfell visit ""The people were not satisfied with the answers,"" he told BBC News. ""The people were getting frustrated and they walked towards the building. They did not force themselves inside. They got inside the main building and were in the foyer, just speaking."" Police then arrived on the scene and formed a barricade, which Mr Al Mansur said led to ""physical confrontation"" between the two sides. There were then angry scenes outside the Clement James Centre, in North Kensington, where the meeting with the prime minister and residents of the tower had been held. Police surrounded a car outside the church and community centre Dozens of demonstrators surged towards the entrance and there were scuffles outside as organisers appealed for calm. Mrs May had faced criticism for not meeting with survivors in the immediate aftermath, unlike Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn and Mayor of London Sadiq Khan. Fragile government facing huge challenge Asked about the reaction of the crowd, Mrs May defended the government's response. ""What I am now absolutely focused on is ensuring we get that support on the ground,"" she said. This video can not be played Theresa May says Â£5m will be available for survivors, and the cause of the Kensington fire is being looked at ""The government is making money available, we are ensuring we are going to get to the bottom of what has happened, we will ensure that people are re-housed. We need to make sure that actually happens."" Mr Corbyn wrote an open letter to the prime minister, calling for the public inquiry to ensure ""all necessary lessons are learned"". The Labour leader added:  ""[The inquiry] must be empowered to consider all the steps that were, or were not, taken leading up to and contributing to this most terrible incident. ""It must also identify the urgent steps that need to be taken in relation to fire safety standards for other buildings of this nature."" Families appeal for missing relatives Sense of community shines through Requisition houses, urges Corbyn Grenfell Tower wall of condolence - read the tributes Large crowds of people also gathered in Westminster and made their way to Downing Street. The crowd was heard chanting, ""Justice for Grenfell"", along with ""May must go"" and ""blood on your hands"". A peaceful march started making its way down Whitehall and was halted by police outside Downing Street, before moving to Oxford Circus, where demonstrators carried out a sit-down protest. The march continued up Regent Street, where they held a minute's silence outside the BBC's headquarters, and continued towards Marble Arch and Notting Hill, ending at Lancaster Gate. Protesters begin marching from Parliament Square The Â£5m Grenfell Tower Residents' Discretionary Fund, announced by Mrs May, includes the aim to re-house residents within three weeks as close to where they lived before as possible, to pay for temporary housing in the meantime and to provide extra financial assistance. During her meeting with survivors, the PM also said they would be consulted on the terms of the public inquiry announced on Thursday and receive state funding for legal representation. Mrs May said: ""Everyone affected by this tragedy needs reassurance that the government is there for them at this terrible time - and that is what I am determined to provide.""

"Despite occasional differences, Mr Kohl forged alliances with UK Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and US President Ronald Reagan Helmut Kohl, Germany's ex-chancellor and architect of reunification in 1990, has died at 87. Kohl led Germany for 16 years (from 1982 to 1998). He is credited with bringing East and West Germany together after the fall of the Berlin Wall. Together with his French ally President Francois Mitterrand, he was responsible for the introduction of the euro. European Commission chief Jean-Claude Juncker has ordered flags at EU institutions to be flown at half-mast. German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Kohl's former protegee who later called for his resignation over a political funding scandal, said his death filled her with deep sadness. ""Helmut Kohl's efforts brought about the two greatest achievements in German politics of recent decades - German reunification and European unity,"" she said. ""Helmut Kohl understood that the two things were inseparable."" An underrated political giant? Tributes to Kohl from around the world Obituary: Helmut Kohl Helmut Kohl's life in pictures For his part, Mr Juncker said in a tweet: ""Helmut's death hurts me deeply."" ""My mentor, my friend, the very essence of Europe, he will be greatly, greatly missed,"" he added. Former US President George HW Bush paid tribute to the man he knew while in office from 1989 to 1993 as a ""true friend of freedom"" and ""one of the greatest leaders in post-war Europe"". Kohl suffered a bad fall in 2008 and had been using a wheelchair. A piece of the Berlin Wall was erected in Kohl's garden in 2011 as a souvenir He died at his house in Ludwigshafen, in the western state of Rhineland-Palatinate, Bild newspaper reports. Kohl, who led the centre-right Christian Democrats, was the longest-serving chancellor of the 20th Century. A passionate believer in European integration, he persuaded Germans to give up their cherished deutschmark in favour of the European single currency. EU flags are being flown at half-mast In the UK, he is remembered for his differences over the EU with the late UK Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. In France, he is the German leader who held hands with Mitterrand at a service at the Verdun war memorial in 1984 to mark the 70th anniversary of World War One. But for Germans he is above all the man who reunified a country divided by the allied powers after World War Two, promising the people of the ex-communist East ""flourishing landscapes"", in unity with the richer West. Helmut Josef Michael Kohl was born on 3 April 1930 into a conservative, Catholic family. His political outlook was shaped by his experiences in his hometown of Ludwigshafen in the Rhineland during World War Two. Because of its huge chemical works, the town was heavily bombed and, at the age of 12, the young Helmut found himself helping to recover the charred bodies of his neighbours from the rubble. What he once described as ""the blessing of a late birth"" freed him from any taints of Nazism. READ ON Kohl fell from grace when a funding scandal under his leadership of the Christian Democrats came to light after he left office in 1998. Angela Merkel (R) has followed in Kohl's footsteps as a long-serving chancellor Chancellor Merkel first entered government under Kohl's rule in 1991. But she publicly denounced him and called for his resignation when it was revealed the party had received millions of dollars worth of illegal donations using secret bank accounts. In 2011, in a series of interviews and statements, he spoke out against Mrs Merkel's policy of strict austerity to deal with the European debt crisis. Kohl's later life was also marked by personal tragedy. His wife, Hannelore, killed herself in July 2001 after suffering from a rare skin condition and depression.

"Online retail giant Amazon is buying Whole Foods in a $13.7bn (Â£10.7bn) deal that marks its biggest push into traditional retailing yet. Amazon, which has long eyed the grocery business, will buy the upmarket supermarket for $42 a share. Investors greeted the deal as game-changing for the industry, sending shares of rival grocers plunging. But Whole Foods, which had been under pressure, climbed. Founded in 1978 in Texas, Whole Foods was a pioneer of the move towards natural and organic foods. It has grown to more than 460 stores in the US, Canada and the UK, and employs about 87,000 people. Amazon founder and chief executive Jeff Bezos said: ""Millions of people love Whole Foods Market because they offer the best natural and organic foods, and they make it fun to eat healthy. ""Whole Foods Market has been satisfying, delighting and nourishing customers for nearly four decades - they're doing an amazing job and we want that to continue."" Whole Foods has faced dissatisfaction from investors, amid falling same-store sales and increased competition. Last month, the company named a new chief financial officer and new board members. In April, activist investor Jana Partners called the firm's shares undervalued, noting ""chronic underperformance"". The price being paid by Amazon marks a 27% premium to the level Whole Foods' shares closed at on Thursday. The $13.7bn value includes assumption of the grocer's debt. The takeover deal - the biggest in Amazon's history - is expected to be completed in the second half of the year, pending approval by shareholders and anti-trust regulators. Whole Foods boss John Mackey said: ""This partnership presents an opportunity to maximize value for Whole Foods Market's shareholders, while at the same time extending our mission and bringing the highest quality, experience, convenience and innovation to our customers."" The Whole Foods brand will continue. Mr Mackey is expected to stay on as chief executive. Whole Foods stock soared 29% on the news. Amazon shares closed up 2.4%. Neil Saunders, managing director of GlobalData Retail, said the deal should give the grocer financial breathing room, while making it more competitive online and improving its supply chain logistics. The takeover also makes Amazon an instant player in the grocery industry, where it has operated at the fringes since launching its food delivery service Amazon Fresh in Seattle in 2007. Whole Foods and Amazon were staying quiet on Friday about how they might introduce technology to stores, merge their supply chains, or cross-sell Amazon products. Brendan Witcher, principal analyst at Forrester Research in Boston, said any changes are further down the road. But that didn't stop instant speculation about what changes might be coming. Possibilities include: â¢Lower prices?Amazon has a long history of deferring profits in favour of winning customers with low prices. It could try a similar strategy at Whole Foods, now knocked by some as ""Whole Paycheck"". â¢Techie shopping?Amazon is also interested in how technology can make shopping more efficient. The firm's Alexa robot maintains shopping lists and Amazon is testing a convenience store in Seattle that operates without check-out lines. ""There is an inherent logic in the move which, in our view, brings benefits to both businesses,"" Mr Saunders wrote. Shares of other supermarket chains took a beating. The industry has already seen significant consolidation, with smaller players wiped out. Kroger shares fell more than 9 %, Target plunged 5% and Costco Wholesale Corp. dropped about 7%. Walmart, which announced its own $310m deal to acquire the online clothing company Bonobos, slid 4.7%. The reaction spread to companies in Europe. Dutch retailer Ahold Delhaize fell nearly 10%. Mr Saunders said the deal is ""potentially terrifying"" for other companies. ""Although Amazon has been a looming threat to the grocery industry, the shadow it has cast has been pale and distant,"" Mr Saunders wrote. ""Today that changed.""

"McDonald's and the International Olympics Committee (IOC) are ending their long-running sponsorship deal three years early. The fast food chain said it was ""reconsidering all aspects of its International Olympics Committee business"" as part of a plan to re-invigorate its business. The IOC said it understood ""that McDonald's is looking to focus on different business priorities"". The partnership began in 1976. ""For these reasons, we have mutually agreed with McDonald's to part ways,"" said the IOC. The next Olympics will take place in Japan during 2020. McDonald's had extended its sponsorship agreement with the Olympics in 2012 for a further eight years. As a ""Top Partner"", it paid a reported $100m for each two-game deal covering the summer and winter Olympic Games up to and including 2020. McDonald's partnership with the IOC will end immediately, but it will continue to be a sponsor of the Olympic Winter Games PyeongChang 2018. The IOC said on Friday: ""The financial terms of the separation was agreed by all parties, details of which are confidential."" A number of companies have ended partnerships with the Olympics recently, including AB InBev's Budweiser, the hotels group Hilton and US telecoms giant AT&T. McDonald's has been restructuring its business to arrest a decline in sales. Steve Easterbrook was appointed as chief executive in 2015 when he said he would ""not shy away from the urgent need to reset this business"". Commenting on the ""mutual"" decision to part ways with the IOC, Silvia Lagnado, global chief marketing officer at McDonald's, said: ""As part of our global growth plan, we are reconsidering all aspects of our business and have made this decision in cooperation with the IOC to focus on different priorities."" The IOC said it has no immediate plans to appoint a direct replacement in the ""retail food operations sponsorship category"" which will be reviewed.

"Many people suffered the effects of smoke inhalation and carbon monoxide poisoning Hospital doctors are keeping some casualties from the Grenfell Tower fire unconscious for several days to allow them to recover from the effects of smoke inhalation. Doctors are currently treating 24 casualties in four hospitals: 12 are in a critical condition. All are said to be suffering from damage to the throat, lungs and airways caused by breathing in smoke. This is the major priority for doctors, rather than external burns. In fact, the BBC understands that no-one is being treated for burns to the skin or body. However, breathing in smoke can cause damaging internal burns and swelling to the throat, which may not be immediately obvious. The most serious cases will need a general anaesthetic. This means they can be kept well-hydrated using an intravenous drip and kept under close supervision while their airways heal. Most will also be suffering fromcarbon monoxide poisoning,external, caused by breathing in noxious fumes from the fire. They need urgent treatment with oxygen through a face mask. Breathing in concentrated oxygen this way enables the body to recover quickly when carbon monoxide enters the bloodstream. Babies, young children, pregnant women and people with asthma are most vulnerable to the dangers of carbon monoxide. Most people in big cities have a level of carbon monoxide of between nought and three, and smokers of five or six. After the fire,the Guardian reported,externalthat doctors were treating people whose readings were between 10 and 20. In total, nearly 80 people have required hospital treatment for the effects of the fire. At least 30 people are confirmed to have died. The local community holds a vigil for victims and survivors of the Grenfell Tower fire While treating the physical effects of smoke inhalation is a priority in the four London hospitals - King's College Hospital, Chelsea and Westminster, Royal Free Hospital and St Mary's Paddington - the psychological impact is not being ignored. Psychiatrists and chaplains have been on hand to help support the injured, relatives and staff. Survivors will have witnessed traumatic sights and many may also have to deal with the loss of loved ones. Prof Sir Simon Wessely, president of the Royal College of Psychiatrists, recommends turning to friends, family and religious leaders to talk through feelings. A man donates water to survivors of the fire ""While mental health professionals are invaluable in times of psychological need, immediately after a traumatic event it is our own strength, and those of our friends and family, that can be the most beneficial. ""Speaking to a mental health professional - a complete stranger - when you are in a state of shock, is not always the solution."" He said the public could play a part by offering practical support and information to those involved in the fire - as the community of North Kensington has been doing in force in the past few days.

"When a fire broke out at Grenfell Tower housing block in west London early Wednesday morning, a number of occupants were able to escape. One of them was 15th floor resident Christos Fairbairn, 41, who has told his story. (Readers may find some details of his account distressing.) I live on the 15th floor of Grenfell Tower. I moved there two years ago. At around 12.45am on Wednesday morning  I was watching TV when I heard aggressive knocking at my door. I heard more activity and noise outside and shortly after I heard an alarm go off in the building. I saw smoke coming into the flat and that's when I realised there was a fire. I rang the fire service and they told me to get out. They said: ""Wrap a wet towel around yourself and get out of the block."" But I opened the door and the smoke was so thick I couldn't. I tried to leave the flat three times and each time the smoke was too thick. I started to panic. I began banging on the window shouting: ""Help me, help me, I'm stuck!"" I tried to open the window but I burnt my hand on the melted plastic. I could see police outside and people just standing there. It felt like they were just watching me. Then I realised if I don't go I would die here. Forty fire engines and 200 firefighters tackled the blaze I wrapped a wet jumper around myself and ran out of the door with just the clothes on my back and my phone. The smoke was black and it was so hot and I couldn't breathe but I kept going. I could feel myself tripping over in the dark. I was tripping over bodies. On one of the floors I tripped badly and fell, as I looked up I saw the face of a dead man. I can still picture him now. As I got to the third or fourth floor I was choking and couldn't breathe. I started to feel faint. I collapsed and that's when I felt a firefighter grab me. I went to hospital and was treated for smoke inhalation. I had so much poison in my lungs. I was crying and having flashbacks. Now I am left with nothing and have nowhere to live. But the council have paid for a room for me in Earl's Court in London where I am staying now. Christos enjoying a drink while on holiday I can't believe I am alive. I will never forget what happened and how traumatising it was. I know I will never live in a tower block again. I feel lucky to be alive but I am devastated for those who were injured and lost their lives. Life is so short I know I will see my family and friends more now and appreciate the life I have. I shouldn't be here today but I am, and for that I am thankful.

"British Airways cabin crew are to stage a two-week strike from 1 July, the Unite union has said, in a long-running dispute over pay and benefits. Unite said BA had refused to accept its final offer on the issue of the ""sanctioning"" of striking cabin crew. The union claims that crew who previously walked out have not had their bonuses or benefits, including free and discounted travel, restored. BA said that the proposed action was ""extreme and completely unnecessary"". Unite said it would ""vigorously"" pursue legal action against BA on behalf of the 1,400 cabin crew affected. The union claims that British Airways has formed a ""blacklist to impose sanctions on striking cabin crew"", which has led to bonus payments being cut and the removal of staff travel concessions. Unite had originally planned a four-day strike to start on Friday, but this was suspended while the two sides tried to resolve the dispute. However, the union has now said its members among BA's mixed fleet crew will go on strike from 00:01 on Saturday 1 July to 23:59 on Sunday 16 July. BA reassured passengers that it would continue to fly all customers to their destinations. The airline said: ""We had reached a deal on pay, which Unite agreed was acceptable. Unite has already confirmed it is pursuing the non-pay issues in this dispute through the courts. ""We urge Unite to let its members vote on the pay proposals."" Unite assistant general secretary Howard Beckett said: ""The refusal by British Airways bosses to meaningfully consider our compromise offer is deeply disappointing. ""A resolution to this long-running dispute was within the grasp of British Airways, but instead of grabbing that opportunity, bosses rebuffed it. It now means British Airways faces an entirely avoidable two-week strike and prolonged legal action on behalf of over 1,400 mixed cabin crew.""

"Actress Elizabeth Banks has apologised to Steven Spielberg after she wrongly ""called him out"" in public for never directing a film with a female lead. The star made the comments at a Women in Film awards ceremony on Wednesday. Actress Shari Belafonte called out from the audience Spielberg had directed the 1985 film The Color Purple, starring Whoopi Goldberg. But after another audience member yelled it was wrong, Banks believed she was still correct. ""I messed up,"" Bankssaid in a tweet,external. The Hunger Games star was awarded an excellence in film prize at the ceremony and used her acceptance speech to highlight gender equality in Hollywood. ""We can't do it by ourselves... It's our responsibility to bring the men along,"" she said. 'I'm wrong' ""I went to Indiana Jones and Jaws and every movie Steven Spielberg ever made, and by the way, he's never made a movie with a female lead. Sorry, Steven. I don't mean to call your ass out, but it's true."" After Belafonte reminded Banks of Oscar-nominated movie The Color Purple, the actress initially corrected herself. ""OK... I'm wrong. Ummmâ¦ he directed?"" she queried. Another guest mistakenly called out no, so Banks concluded: ""Oh, so I'm right still,"" and moved on. The error was much talked about in both social and general media - especially as The Color Purple focuses on the issues African American women faced in early 20th Century. The Color Purple Based on the 1982 Pulitzer Prize-winning novel by Alice Walker Set in rural Georgia, tells the story of oppressed African-American girl Celie Addresses themes of racism, misogyny, equality and domestic violence Nominated for 11 Oscars - including best actress for Whoopi Goldberg and best supporting actress for Oprah Winfrey and Margaret Avery - but didn't win any Banks posted a lengthy apology on Twitter on Thursday, saying she ""framed [her] comments about [Spielberg's] films inaccurately"". ""I want to be clear from the start that I take full responsibility for what I said and I'm sorry,"" she wrote. ""When I made the comments, I was thinking of recent films Steven directed, it was not my intention to dismiss the importance of the iconic #TheColorPurple. ""I made things worse by giving the impression that I was dismissing Shari Belafonte when she attempted to correct me. I spoke with Shari backstage and she was kind enough to forgive me. ""Those who have the privilege and honour of directing and producing films should be held to account for our mistakes, whether it's about diversity or inaccurate statements. I'm very sorry."" Steven Spielberg directed Elizabeth Banks in 2002 film Catch Me If You Can Since Banks's error, others have pointed out that while she was wrong in her claim about Spielberg, the director has only helmed three films out of his 30 which feature a female lead. In addition to The Color Purple, he also directed Goldie Hawn in The Sugarland Express (1974) and his most recent film, The BFG, featured 12-year-old Ruby Barnhill in the lead. His next film, The Papers, also stars Meryl Streep in the main role as the first US female newspaper publisher. Banks is next set to direct a rebooted film version of Charlie's Angels. As well as appearing in the Pitch Perfect series of films, she directed the second and served as a producer on all three.

"Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi seen delivering a sermon in 2014 Russia's defence ministry is investigating whether one of its air strikes in Syria killed the leader of the Islamic State militant group (IS). The ministry said an air strike may have killed Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi and up to 330 other fighters on 28 May. It said the raid had targeted a meeting of the IS military council in the group's de facto capital of Raqqa, in northern Syria. There have been a number of previous reports of Baghdadi's death. This is the first time, however, that Russia has said it may have killed the IS leader. Other media reports have previously claimed he had been killed or critically injured by US-led coalition air strikes. Forces opposed to IS have been closing in on Raqqa in recent weeks. Russia sent an air force contingent to Syria in September 2015 to shore up President Bashar al-Assad, bombing both IS and other rebel groups opposed to the government. Islamic State group: The full story Life under IS: A Raqqa diary Thirty IS field commanders and up to 300 fighters were at the meeting in a southern suburb of Raqqa,the defence ministry said on its Facebook page,external. Baghdadi and the others had gathered to plan escape routes from the city, the ministry said. Before and after satellite images published by Russia's defence ministry show the building damaged in the air strike The Russian air force launched an air strike between 00:35 and 00:45 local time (21:35 and 21:45 GMT 27 May), after notifying the US military in advance. Su-35 and Su-34 jets were used in the strike, which was preceded by drone reconnaissance flights, the ministry said. According to the Russian defence ministry, which published photos of the site targeted before and after, other IS figures killed in the strike include Emir of Raqqa Abu al-Haji al-Masri, Emir Ibrahim al-Naef al-Hajj and IS security chief Suleiman al-Sawah. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov told reporters he was still seeking the facts of what had happened, saying, ""I do not have 100% confirmation of the information about the elimination of Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi."" Hours after the air strike, IS media released a video showing extensive damage to buildings and a number of dead people, mostly covered up, blaming ""US air strikes"". The US-led coalition said on Friday it could not confirm whether Baghdadi had been killed. There has been no official comment from Syria's government. This video can not be played Tens of thousands have left Raqqa as fighting intensifies Baghdadi's whereabouts have been unknown for some time, although he was believed to be in Mosul in Iraq before a US-led coalition began an effort to reclaim the city in October 2016. He has made only one public appearance in recent years - in a video delivering a sermon in Mosul on 5 July 2014, shortly after IS captured the city. His last audio message was released on 2 November last year. Rami Abdulrahman, director of the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights monitoring group, was quoted by Reuters news agency as saying he had information that Baghdadi was in another part of Syria at the end of May and was not killed. In March, US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said that ""nearly all"" of Baghdadi's deputies had been killed. Baghdadi - a nom de guerre rather than his real name - is believed to have been born in Samarra, north of Baghdad, in 1971. Reports suggest he was a cleric in a mosque in the city around the time of the US-led invasion in 2003. The Iraqi interior ministry released this image of Baghdadi in January 2014 Some believe he was already a militant jihadist during the rule of Saddam Hussein. Others suggest he was radicalised during the four years he was held at Camp Bucca, a US facility in southern Iraq where many al-Qaeda commanders were detained. He emerged as the leader of al-Qaeda in Iraq, one of the groups that later became Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (IS), in 2010. In October 2011, the US officially designated Baghdadi as a terrorist. It hasoffered a reward,externalof up to $25m (Â£19.6m) for information leading to his capture or death. So far, there has been minimal reaction from online supporters of IS to news of the reported death of the group's leader, BBC Monitoring reports. IS sympathisers typically ignore reports from unofficial IS sources or ridicule them, especially given that Baghdadi's death has been reported several times in the past. This video can not be played A Raqqa resident describes daily life under so-called Islamic State. One high-profile IS supporter on the messaging app Telegram shared a post denying the news and saying that when an IS leadership figure is killed, the group does not hide it. IS normally does not rush to confirm the death of leadership figures, and would belatedly and sometimes indirectly announce them in general messages or by naming military campaigns after the deceased leader. However, in the case of IS spokesman Abu-Muhammad al-Adnani, the group rushed to announce his death on 30 August 2016, the same day he was targeted in a US air strike in Syria, pre-empting any reports by the military or media.

"This video can not be played Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn visited the site and spoke to locals Empty flats in North Kensington should be ""requisitioned if necessary"" for people left homeless by the Grenfell Tower fire, Jeremy Corbyn says. The Labour leader has also said he is ""very angry"" that so many lives were lost in a deadly tower block fire. PM Theresa May said the residents were ""in our thoughts and prayers"" and has ordered a public inquiry into the fire. But she was criticised by a senior Labour MP for failing to meet residents when she visited the scene on Thursday. At least 17 people died in the disaster at Grenfell Tower in North Kensington, west London in the early hours of Wednesday. Reality Check: Can the government requisition homes? PM orders public inquiry Six questions for the investigators Live updates Mr Corbyn, who earlier released a statement saying he was ""very angry that it was possible for the fire to spread in the way it did,"" said people living in high-rise flats would be frightened following the Grenfell Tower disaster and needed answers to give them ""peace of mind"". And he told MPs on Thursday: ""The south part of Kensington is incredibly wealthy, it's the wealthiest part of the country. ""The ward where this fire took place is, I think the poorest ward in the whole country. ""And properties must be found, requisitioned if necessary, in order to make sure those residents do get re-housed locally. ""It cannot be acceptable that in London you have luxury buildings and luxury flats kept as land banking for the future while the homeless and the poor look for somewhere to live."" Communities and Local Government Secretary Sajid Javid promised the government would ""act immediately"" and will do ""whatever is required"", even if it costs billions of pounds. Asked if this could include high rise blocks being knocked down, he said: ""I think there's no place that we can't go now to make properties safe in terms of learning from this."" But Mr Javid stressed that the government's response must be led by evidence from the fire investigators' report. This video can not be played Communities minister Sajid Javid tells Today the Grenfell Tower fire should not have happened He told Radio 4's Today programme: ""Whatever they tell us, that is exactly what we need to deal with and we need to deal with it immediately - there will be no bars to that. We will deal with it, but we have to be led by the expert opinion on this."" Asked whether dealing with the findings would include evacuating other buildings, Mr Javid said: ""Whatever they tell us is necessary to make those people safe, there can be no shortcuts to this."" Mrs May met police and firefighters at a private visit to the site but was not seen speaking to residents who survived the fire. Mr Corbyn was pictured speaking to local people. Labour Mayor of London Sadiq Khan was heckled by some angry residents at the scene when he visited. Mr Khan praised the local community spirit but added: ""People are angry and I share that anger."" Downing Street said that Mrs May's visit was made to get a briefing from the emergency services to ensure that they had the resources they needed. But Labour's former deputy leader Harriet Harmanwrote on Twitter:,external""Theresa May should have met Grenfell fire residents. She should have been prepared to listen to them Not OK to speak at them via TV."" The prime minister has praised the way the local community had supported the residents and praised the ""professionalism and bravery"" of the emergency services. She pledged that the government ""stands ready to provide every assistance"" to the council and emergency services. ""I want to reassure the residents of Grenfell Tower - all of whom are in our thoughts and prayers - that the government will make every effort to make sure that they are re-housed in London and as close as possible to home."" She has ordered a judge-led public inquiry into the disaster. Ministers have also made emergency funding available to local authorities to support people affected. But MPs demanded answers in a specially-arranged session in Westminster Hall on Thursday, while Parliament is still suspended. At the start of the special meeting in Westminster's Grand Committee Room, Fire Minister Nick Hurd said: ""What we are dealing with here is a national tragedy."" He said the ""exceptionally complex"" investigation would take several months, and there would be no room for ""plodding bureaucracy"" in the official response. ""It is the intention of the government to leave absolutely no stone unturned,"" he said. Only part of the specially-arranged meeting was filmed by the Commons authorities Answers were needed about fire walls, sprinkler systems, the alarm system and how the fire spread, he said. ""Every single person living in a high-rise building today will be frightened, will be traumatised and will be very, very worried."" Shadow housing minister John Healey urged ministers to begin installing sprinkler systems immediately and not to wait for the result of the public inquiry. The new housing minister, Alok Sharma, said he too had heard accounts of residents who said they had warned about fire safety. The government was talking to councils and housing associations about getting checks on other buildings done quickly, he said. At the end of the meeting, he promised ""every single family"" would be re-housed in the local area. Theresa May spoke to emergency workers when she visited the scene Earlier Theresa May ordered a full public inquiry, ""to ensure that this terrible tragedy is properly investigated"". Labour is calling for measures recommended after another fatal fire in 2009 to be implemented immediately. Recommendations made after afire in a tower blockin Lakanal House in Camberwell in which six people died included installing sprinkler systems in high-risk buildings and reviewing building regulations. In October the former Housing Minister, Gavin Barwell, said the government had ""publicly committed"" to reviewing building regulations in relation to fire safety after the Lakanal House fire. Mr Healey said this review had ""not been started"". This video can not be played London fire: PM orders full public inquiry ""The residents and others have some really serious questions to put to ministers and the people who run the building,"" he said. Responding to reports, the Department for Communities and Local Government said it was ""simply not true"" that a report about building regulations had been ""sat on"". The BBC understands the Lord Chief Justice will make a recommendation to the prime minister of a judge to chair the inquiry. He or she will be independent from the government and able to call who they want as a witness. The Liberal Democrats have called for an urgent review into fire safety and building regulations.

"A large police presence held back angry crowds outside a Kensington church where Theresa May was meeting victims of the Grenfell Tower disaster. The prime minister faced cries of ""coward"" and ""shame on you"". One woman wept, saying it was because the PM declined to speak to anyone outside the meeting which lasted less than hour. Mrs May pledged Â£5m of support, housing guarantees and help with access to bank accounts and cash. Laura Kuenssberg: Fragile government facing huge challenge Tower block fires: Did government act on advice? Tower victims 'may never be identified' Live updates: Recovery continues after tower blaze ""The package of support I'm announcing today is to give the victims the immediate support they need to care for themselves and for loved ones. We will continue to look at what more needs to be done,"" Mrs May said in a statement issued by her office. Dozens of demonstrators surged towards the entrance of St Clement's church and there were scuffles outside as organisers appealed for calm. Earlier on Friday, the prime minister spent almost an hour speaking to patients and staff at London's Chelsea and Westminster Hospital. It came a day after she faced criticism for meeting firefighters but not residents at the scene of the blaze. She also chaired the government's Civil Contingencies Committee, which deals with major crises such as terrorism or natural disasters, in Whitehall. But local people have contrasted the style of Mrs May's private visit to the scene with those of London Mayor Sadiq Khan and Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, who was seen with his arm around the shoulders of people affected by the disaster. Also on Friday, the Queen and the Duke of Cambridge met volunteers, local residents and community representatives while visiting Westway Sports Centre, near the tower block in north Kensington. The Queen was accompanied by the Duke of Cambridge on a visit to Westway Sports Centre Theresa May went on a private visit to meet firefighters at the scene on Thursday During interview with the BBC, Mrs May sidestepped questions over her response to the disaster. Pressed on whether she had failed to understand the anger felt by the community, she said: ""This was a terrible tragedy that took place. People have lost their lives and others have lost everything, all their possessions, their home and everything. ""What we are doing is putting in place the support that will help them."" She said she had worked to ensure public services had the support they needed in order to be able to deal with the immediate aftermath. Conservative former Cabinet minister Michael Portillo said Mrs May should have been prepared to face residents' anger. He told BBC's This Week: ""Alas Mrs May was what she has been for the last five or six weeks, that is to say she wanted an entirely controlled situation in which she didn't use her humanity. ""She met in private with the emergency services, a good thing to do no doubt, but she should have been there with the residents, which is what Jeremy Corbyn was."" But Commons leader Andrea Leadsom, who also faced some anger when she visited a community centre in the area on Friday, insisted that Mrs May was ""absolutely heartbroken"" by the blaze and was simply trying to make sure the government did everything it could to deal with its aftermath. Mrs Leadsom said: ""In reality, every single member of the House of Commons, every member of the government from the prime minister downwards are absolutely horrified by what's happened and we are all trying to do the best we can. ""I don't really think it is appropriate to be talking about whether people have humanity or not."" As she spoke to Sky News at the site in west London, she was confronted by a local resident, who said opportunities had been missed to make the 24-storey block safe following a report into the 2009 Lakanal House fire in Camberwell, south London. This video can not be played Communities minister Sajid Javid tells Today the Grenfell Tower fire should not have happened ""Why are Sadiq Khan and Corbyn coming down here to speak to people and Theresa May is coming here with police, walking around, not meeting no-one, not meeting families?"" the man said. ""This fire could have been stopped a long, long time ago... There's not even sprinklers in there. ""In 2009, the last block was on fire. What has changed since then? Nothing. Enough is enough, I have got friends in that tower. I have a right to be angry. Because of people saving money, people are dying."" Former Labour deputy leader Harriet Harman said it was ""not OK"" for the prime minister to go to the area but not meet residents, and called on her to invite them to talk to her in Downing Street, as victims of the 2009 Lakanal House fire had been. But on the BBC's Question Time programme on Thursday, Conservative defence minister Tobias Ellwood said there were ""security reasons"" why Mrs May had not met residents. And former housing minister Mark Prisk said Mrs May would not have wanted ""to bring the whole weight of the media circus down on families who are going through some pretty grim days"". But BBC royal correspondent Peter Hunt said there would be questions about why the Queen was able to make such a visit, and the prime minister was not. Downing Street said that Mrs May's visit on Thursday had been made to get a briefing from the emergency services to ensure that they had the resources they needed. On Friday, Mrs May visited the Chelsea and Westminster Hospital which is treating eight people, three of whom are in critical care. Communities Secretary Sajid Javid told the BBC on Friday there would be immediate action following early conclusions from an investigative report into the fire. ""We need to do whatever it takes to make people that live in those properties safe: that's either make the properties safe or find some other accommodation, it has to be done,"" Mr Javid told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. ""In this country, in this century, for this kind of thing to happen it is horrific and we cannot allow anything like this to ever happen again.""

Communities and Local Government Secretary Sajid Javid promised the government would ""act immediately"" and will do ""whatever is required"", even if it costs billions of pounds. Asked if this could include high rise blocks being knocked down, he said: ""I think there's no place that we can't go now to make properties safe in terms of learning from this."" But Mr Javid stressed that the government's response must be led by evidence from the fire investigators' report. This video can not be played Communities minister Sajid Javid tells Today the Grenfell Tower fire should not have happened He told Radio 4's Today programme: ""Whatever they tell us, that is exactly what we need to deal with and we need to deal with it immediately - there will be no bars to that. We will deal with it, but we have to be led by the expert opinion on this."" Asked whether dealing with the findings would include evacuating other buildings, Mr Javid said: ""Whatever they tell us is necessary to make those people safe, there can be no shortcuts to this."" Mrs May met police and firefighters at a private visit to the site but was not seen speaking to residents who survived the fire. Mr Corbyn was pictured speaking to local people. Labour Mayor of London Sadiq Khan was heckled by some angry residents at the scene when he visited. Mr Khan praised the local community spirit but added: ""People are angry and I share that anger."" Downing Street said that Mrs May's visit was made to get a briefing from the emergency services to ensure that they had the resources they needed. But Labour's former deputy leader Harriet Harmanwrote on Twitter:,external""Theresa May should have met Grenfell fire residents. She should have been prepared to listen to them Not OK to speak at them via TV."" The prime minister has praised the way the local community had supported the residents and praised the ""professionalism and bravery"" of the emergency services. She pledged that the government ""stands ready to provide every assistance"" to the council and emergency services. ""I want to reassure the residents of Grenfell Tower - all of whom are in our thoughts and prayers - that the government will make every effort to make sure that they are re-housed in London and as close as possible to home."" She has ordered a judge-led public inquiry into the disaster. Ministers have also made emergency funding available to local authorities to support people affected. But MPs demanded answers in a specially-arranged session in Westminster Hall on Thursday, while Parliament is still suspended. At the start of the special meeting in Westminster's Grand Committee Room, Fire Minister Nick Hurd said: ""What we are dealing with here is a national tragedy."" He said the ""exceptionally complex"" investigation would take several months, and there would be no room for ""plodding bureaucracy"" in the official response. ""It is the intention of the government to leave absolutely no stone unturned,"" he said. Only part of the specially-arranged meeting was filmed by the Commons authorities Answers were needed about fire walls, sprinkler systems, the alarm system and how the fire spread, he said. ""Every single person living in a high-rise building today will be frightened, will be traumatised and will be very, very worried."" Shadow housing minister John Healey urged ministers to begin installing sprinkler systems immediately and not to wait for the result of the public inquiry. The new housing minister, Alok Sharma, said he too had heard accounts of residents who said they had warned about fire safety. The government was talking to councils and housing associations about getting checks on other buildings done quickly, he said. At the end of the meeting, he promised ""every single family"" would be re-housed in the local area. Theresa May spoke to emergency workers when she visited the scene Earlier Theresa May ordered a full public inquiry, ""to ensure that this terrible tragedy is properly investigated"". Labour is calling for measures recommended after another fatal fire in 2009 to be implemented immediately. Recommendations made after afire in a tower blockin Lakanal House in Camberwell in which six people died included installing sprinkler systems in high-risk buildings and reviewing building regulations. In October the former Housing Minister, Gavin Barwell, said the government had ""publicly committed"" to reviewing building regulations in relation to fire safety after the Lakanal House fire. Mr Healey said this review had ""not been started"". This video can not be played London fire: PM orders full public inquiry ""The residents and others have some really serious questions to put to ministers and the people who run the building,"" he said. Responding to reports, the Department for Communities and Local Government said it was ""simply not true"" that a report about building regulations had been ""sat on"". The BBC understands the Lord Chief Justice will make a recommendation to the prime minister of a judge to chair the inquiry. He or she will be independent from the government and able to call who they want as a witness. The Liberal Democrats have called for an urgent review into fire safety and building regulations.

"GCHQ can detect the work of hackers around the globe British security officials believe that hackers in North Korea were behind the cyber-attack that crippled parts of the NHS and other organisations around the world last month, the BBC has learned. Britain's National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) led the international investigation. Security sources have told the BBC that the NCSC believes that a hacking group known as Lazarus launched the attack. The US Computer Emergency Response Teamhas also warned about Lazarus.,external The same group is believed to have targeted Sony Pictures in 2014. The Sony hack came as the company planned to release the movie The Interview, a satire about the North Korean leadership starring Seth Rogen. The movie was eventually given a limited release after an initial delay. The same group is also thought to have been behind the theft of money from banks. In May, ransomware called WannaCry swept across the world, locking computers and demanding payment for them to be unlocked. The NHS in the UK was particularly badly hit. Officials in Britain's National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) began their own investigation and concluded their assessment in recent weeks. The ransomware did not target Britain or the NHS specifically, and may well have been a money-making scheme that got out of control, particularly since the hackers do not appear to have retrieved any of the ransom money as yet. Although the group is based in North Korea the exact role of the leadership in Pyongyang in ordering the attack is less clear. Private sector cyber-security researchers around the world began picking apart the code to try to understand who was behind the attack soon after. Adrian Nish, who leads the cyber threat intelligence team at BAE Systems, saw overlaps with previous code developed by the Lazarus group. ""It seems to tie back to the same code-base and the same authors,"" Nish says. ""The code-overlaps are significant."" The WannaCry ransomware has been linked to a North Korean hacking group. Private sector cyber security researchers reverse engineered the code but the British assessment by the NCSC - part of the intelligence agency GCHQ - is likely to have been made based on a wider set of sources. America's NSA has also more recently made the link to North Korea but its assessment is not thought to have been based on as deep as an investigation as the UK, partly because the US was not hit as hard by the incident. Officials say they have not seen any significant evidence supporting other possible culprits. North Korean hackers have been linked to money-making attacks in the past - such as the theft of $81m from the central bank of Bangladesh in 2016. This sophisticated attack involved making transfers through the Swift payment system which, in some cases, were then laundered through casinos in the Philippines. ""It was one of the biggest bank heists of all time in physical space or in cyberspace,"" says Nish, who says further activity has been seen in banks in Poland and Mexico. The Lazarus group has also been linked to the use of ransomware - including against a South Korean supermarket chain. Other analysts say they saw signs of North Korea investigating the bitcoin method of payment in recent months. The May 2017 attack was indiscriminate rather than targeted. Its spread was global and may have only been slowed thanks to the work of a British researcher who was able to find a ""kill switch"" to slow it down. The attacks caused huge disruption in the short term but they may have also been a strategic failure for the group behind it. Researchers at Elliptic, a UK-based company which tracks bitcoin payments, say they have seen no withdrawals out of the wallets into which money was paid, although people are still paying in to them. Those behind the attack may not have expected it to have spread as fast as it did. Once they realised that their behaviour was drawing global attention, the risks of moving the money may have been seen as too high given the relatively small amount involved, leaving them with little to show for their work. The revelation of the link to North Korea will raise difficult questions about what can be done to respond or deter such behaviour in the future.

A recent Office of National Statistics survey suggested there are 5.4 million fraud and computer misuse cases a year.

"This video can not be played Angry protesters stormed Kensington Town Hall, demanding answers Protests were held in London as residents demanded support for those affected by the Grenfell Tower fire. Between 50 and 60 people stormed Kensington and Chelsea Town Hall as members of the public said the homeless needed help ""right now"". Crowds gathered outside a hall where PM Theresa May met survivors and protests were also held at Downing Street. Mrs May sanctioned Â£5m for clothes, food and emergency supplies, as the death toll rose to at least 30. The BBC understands those missing could number about 70, with the 30 likely to be among that number. Three of those who diedhave been identified. There was nothing to suggest the fire was started deliberately, police said. Between 50 and 60 protesters rushed into the council building Hundreds of mourners stood arm in arm at a vigil and held a two-minute silence for victims of the fire. Many wept openly as candles illuminated the road outside the Latymer Christian Centre, yards from the site of the blaze. The fire broke out shortly before 01:00 BST on Wednesday. It tore through all floors of the building and took more than 200 firefighters 24 hours to bring it under control. Mahad Egal, who escaped his fourth floor flat with his family, said: ""At first it seemed it was controllable, but really quickly the fire started to rise as the cladding caught fire. It is incredible we survived."" Emergency services spent a third day searching for bodies in the burnt-out Grenfell Tower in North Kensington. A vigil has been set up near to the site of the disaster Hundreds gathered arm in arm and raised candles as they observed a two-minute silence This video can not be played An angry crowd chanted to Theresa May: ""Shame on you!"" The first protest began at around 15:00 at the town hall and scores later joined it. At about 16:30, people began to rush up the steps and make their way into the building. One member of the public said: ""Nobody knows what is happening. People are so angry. Those people shouldn't be sleeping in the street."" Mustafa Al Mansur, who organised the protest, read a statement from the council which promised to re-house as many people locally as they could and to provide funding for those affected. But he called the response ""flimsy"" with ""no concrete answers"" - especially on the question of number of residents who lived in the flats. Latest updates: Death toll expected to rise What we know so far 'The working class aren't being listened to' How one Grenfell Tower resident escaped May faces criticism over Grenfell visit ""The people were not satisfied with the answers,"" he told BBC News. ""The people were getting frustrated and they walked towards the building. They did not force themselves inside. They got inside the main building and were in the foyer, just speaking."" Police then arrived on the scene and formed a barricade, which Mr Al Mansur said led to ""physical confrontation"" between the two sides. There were then angry scenes outside the Clement James Centre, in North Kensington, where the meeting with the prime minister and residents of the tower had been held. Police surrounded a car outside the church and community centre Dozens of demonstrators surged towards the entrance and there were scuffles outside as organisers appealed for calm. Mrs May had faced criticism for not meeting with survivors in the immediate aftermath, unlike Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn and Mayor of London Sadiq Khan.

The Labour leader added:  ""[The inquiry] must be empowered to consider all the steps that were, or were not, taken leading up to and contributing to this most terrible incident.

The crowd was heard chanting, ""Justice for Grenfell"", along with ""May must go"" and ""blood on your hands"". A peaceful march started making its way down Whitehall and was halted by police outside Downing Street, before moving to Oxford Circus, where demonstrators carried out a sit-down protest. The march continued up Regent Street, where they held a minute's silence outside the BBC's headquarters, and continued towards Marble Arch and Notting Hill, ending at Lancaster Gate. Protesters begin marching from Parliament Square The Â£5m Grenfell Tower Residents' Discretionary Fund, announced by Mrs May, includes the aim to re-house residents within three weeks as close to where they lived before as possible, to pay for temporary housing in the meantime and to provide extra financial assistance. During her meeting with survivors, the PM also said they would be consulted on the terms of the public inquiry announced on Thursday and receive state funding for legal representation. Mrs May said: ""Everyone affected by this tragedy needs reassurance that the government is there for them at this terrible time - and that is what I am determined to provide.""

"Otto Warmbier's parents say they went 15 months without hearing from or about their son A team of US doctors have found ""no sign of botulism"" in the American student freed by North Korea after more than 15 months in captivity. The regime had said the 22-year-old Otto Warmbier's coma was caused last year by botulism and a sleeping pill he took after his trial. He has not spoken since his return to his family hometown in Ohio. ""His neurological condition can be best described as a state of unresponsive wakefulness,"" said Dr Daniel Kanter. Mr Warmbier ""shows no understanding of language"" and has ""extensive loss of brain tissue"" which was likely caused by cardiopulmonary arrest, he said. The doctors said they believe Mr Warmbier's condition was caused by respiratory arrest According to scans taken after he arrived at the Cincinnati Medical Center earlier this week, there is no sign that he was physically abused during his detention, his doctors say. How harsh is prison in North Korea? How might Trump do a deal with N Korea? Mr Warmbier's condition is ""not what we normally see with traumatic brain injury. It's the type we see with cardiopulmonary arrest,"" Dr Kanter told reporters. They believe respiratory arrest led to his condition, which is caused by a lack of oxygen and blood in the brain. Earlier on Thursday,Mr Warmbier's fatherexpressed doubts about the North Korean account of what caused the University of Virginia student's coma. This video can not be played Otto Warmbier's dad: N Korea's treatment of my son 'horrible' ""Even if you believe their explanation of botulism and a sleeping pill causing the coma - and we don't - there's no excuse for a civilised nation to have kept his condition secret and to have denied him top notch medical care."" Otto Warmbier, an economics student from the University of Virginia, was arrested in January 2016 while visiting North Korea as a tourist. He was given a 15-year prison sentence for attempting to steal a propaganda sign from a hotel. Botulism is a type of poisoning which can cause total body paralysis, difficulty in breathing and death in some cases. It's caused by theClostridium botulinumbacteria, but the symptoms of botulism are not from the bacteria themselves. Instead, the microscopic organisms produce a powerful toxin which attacks the nervous system and causes paralysis. That poison is called botulinum - which you may know for its commercial use in Botox, which removes wrinkles by paralysing facial muscles. Botulism is contracted in two ways in adults - by eating food contaminated with the toxin, or through wounds. The foodborne method happens when the bacteria are tinned or stored in food in another way that deprives them from air (which is when they produce the poison). This rarely happens in modern Western food production, but is what North Korea claims happened to Mr Warmbier. How harsh is prison in North Korea?

But she was criticised by a senior Labour MP for failing to meet residents when she visited the scene on Thursday. At least 17 people died in the disaster at Grenfell Tower in North Kensington, west London in the early hours of Wednesday. Reality Check: Can the government requisition homes? PM orders public inquiry Six questions for the investigators Live updates Mr Corbyn, who earlier released a statement saying he was ""very angry that it was possible for the fire to spread in the way it did,"" said people living in high-rise flats would be frightened following the Grenfell Tower disaster and needed answers to give them ""peace of mind"". And he told MPs on Thursday: ""The south part of Kensington is incredibly wealthy, it's the wealthiest part of the country. ""The ward where this fire took place is, I think the poorest ward in the whole country. ""And properties must be found, requisitioned if necessary, in order to make sure those residents do get re-housed locally. ""It cannot be acceptable that in London you have luxury buildings and luxury flats kept as land banking for the future while the homeless and the poor look for somewhere to live."" Communities and Local Government Secretary Sajid Javid promised the government would ""act immediately"" and will do ""whatever is required"", even if it costs billions of pounds. Asked if this could include high rise blocks being knocked down, he said: ""I think there's no place that we can't go now to make properties safe in terms of learning from this."" But Mr Javid stressed that the government's response must be led by evidence from the fire investigators' report. This video can not be played Communities minister Sajid Javid tells Today the Grenfell Tower fire should not have happened He told Radio 4's Today programme: ""Whatever they tell us, that is exactly what we need to deal with and we need to deal with it immediately - there will be no bars to that. We will deal with it, but we have to be led by the expert opinion on this."" Asked whether dealing with the findings would include evacuating other buildings, Mr Javid said: ""Whatever they tell us is necessary to make those people safe, there can be no shortcuts to this."" Mrs May met police and firefighters at a private visit to the site but was not seen speaking to residents who survived the fire. Mr Corbyn was pictured speaking to local people. Labour Mayor of London Sadiq Khan was heckled by some angry residents at the scene when he visited. Mr Khan praised the local community spirit but added: ""People are angry and I share that anger."" Downing Street said that Mrs May's visit was made to get a briefing from the emergency services to ensure that they had the resources they needed. But Labour's former deputy leader Harriet Harmanwrote on Twitter:,external""Theresa May should have met Grenfell fire residents. She should have been prepared to listen to them Not OK to speak at them via TV."" The prime minister has praised the way the local community had supported the residents and praised the ""professionalism and bravery"" of the emergency services. She pledged that the government ""stands ready to provide every assistance"" to the council and emergency services. ""I want to reassure the residents of Grenfell Tower - all of whom are in our thoughts and prayers - that the government will make every effort to make sure that they are re-housed in London and as close as possible to home."" She has ordered a judge-led public inquiry into the disaster. Ministers have also made emergency funding available to local authorities to support people affected. But MPs demanded answers in a specially-arranged session in Westminster Hall on Thursday, while Parliament is still suspended. At the start of the special meeting in Westminster's Grand Committee Room, Fire Minister Nick Hurd said: ""What we are dealing with here is a national tragedy."" He said the ""exceptionally complex"" investigation would take several months, and there would be no room for ""plodding bureaucracy"" in the official response. ""It is the intention of the government to leave absolutely no stone unturned,"" he said. Only part of the specially-arranged meeting was filmed by the Commons authorities Answers were needed about fire walls, sprinkler systems, the alarm system and how the fire spread, he said. ""Every single person living in a high-rise building today will be frightened, will be traumatised and will be very, very worried."" Shadow housing minister John Healey urged ministers to begin installing sprinkler systems immediately and not to wait for the result of the public inquiry. The new housing minister, Alok Sharma, said he too had heard accounts of residents who said they had warned about fire safety. The government was talking to councils and housing associations about getting checks on other buildings done quickly, he said. At the end of the meeting, he promised ""every single family"" would be re-housed in the local area. Theresa May spoke to emergency workers when she visited the scene Earlier Theresa May ordered a full public inquiry, ""to ensure that this terrible tragedy is properly investigated"". Labour is calling for measures recommended after another fatal fire in 2009 to be implemented immediately. Recommendations made after afire in a tower blockin Lakanal House in Camberwell in which six people died included installing sprinkler systems in high-risk buildings and reviewing building regulations. In October the former Housing Minister, Gavin Barwell, said the government had ""publicly committed"" to reviewing building regulations in relation to fire safety after the Lakanal House fire. Mr Healey said this review had ""not been started"". This video can not be played London fire: PM orders full public inquiry ""The residents and others have some really serious questions to put to ministers and the people who run the building,"" he said. Responding to reports, the Department for Communities and Local Government said it was ""simply not true"" that a report about building regulations had been ""sat on"". The BBC understands the Lord Chief Justice will make a recommendation to the prime minister of a judge to chair the inquiry. He or she will be independent from the government and able to call who they want as a witness. The Liberal Democrats have called for an urgent review into fire safety and building regulations.

"Emma Stone's Easy A is one of the films to be on Sony's initial Clean Version list If you've been on a long-haul flight recently, you might have noticed the films being shown were a bit different from their cinematic release. They're usually a bit shorter as they've been made family-friendly for any young eyes who can see your screen. Earlier this month Sony decided to make these sanitised versions available to download at home, choosing 24 titles including Ghostbusters and Easy A. But now they've had to backtrack after filmmakers complained about the move. There's an initial list of 24 films which have been watered down. They include action dramas, superhero movies and romcoms. Those films are: 50 First Dates, Battle Of The Year, Big Daddy, Captain Phillips Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon, Easy A, Elysium, Ghostbusters Ghostbusters II, Goosebumps, Grown Ups, Grown Ups 2 Hancock, Inferno, Moneyball, Pixels, Spider-Man, Spider-Man 2 Spider-Man 3, The Amazing Spider-Man, The Amazing Spider-Man 2 Step Brothers, Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby, White House Down It varies from film to film - perhaps unsurprising as their ratings vary from PG to R. For example, the clean version of Will Ferrell comedy Step Brothers - originally given an R rating for ""crude and sexual content"" according to Sony - has had 23 instances of violence taken out, 152 of bad language and 91 of sexual content. The Drew Barrymore and Adam Sandler romcom 50 First Dates had a PG13 for ""crude sexual humour and drug references"". Its clean version has 10 violent moments taken out, 34 uses of bad language and 34 instances of sexual content. Matt Damon sci-fi film Elysium, which also had an R rating for ""bloody violence"", had 18 of those violent moments taken out, 63 uses of bad language and one instance of sexual content. Horror comedy Goosebumps was a PG when it came out - so could be described as family-friendly already. But its clean version had four fewer incidences of violence, with five uses of bad language and five examples of nudity taken out too. Step Brothers, starring Will Ferrell, had 152 swears taken out After the outcry the president of Sony Pictures Home Entertainment, Man Jit Singh, said their directors were of ""paramount importance to us"" and they wanted to ""respect those relationships to the utmost"". ""We believed we had obtained approvals from the film-makers involved, for use of their previously supervised television versions as a value-added extra on sales of the full version,"" he said. ""But if any of them are unhappy or have reconsidered, we will discontinue it for their films."" The Clean Version initiative was launched, complete with its own website, at the beginning of June. In its initial press release, Sony said the initiative would ""allow viewers to screen the broadcast or airline versions of select Sony films, free from certain mature content"". They said Clean Version,external""allows viewing for a wider audience giving people the chance to watch their favourite films together"". The move comes after third party services had been making similar edits of films - so Sony decided to do the work themselves too. They can choose to download a clean version of the film from a number of platforms listed on Sony's website. The original version is included together with the edited film. Seth Rogen (left) and Judd Apatow have spoken out against the scheme and want to keep their films as they are Mixed. Knocked Up star Seth Rogen (who doesn't have any films affected by the move so far) was one of the first to react when news of Clean Version emerged. He pleaded, adding a swear word for emphasis, ""please don't do this to our movies"". He went on to explain some of the changes that were made to a TV version of Pineapple Express, by way of an example - saying that one expletive became ""j'accuse!"" and the word ""casserole"" was used to substitute a similar-sounding swear word. Here's an exchange he had on Twitter about the Sony scheme: Judd Apatow, who produced Step Brothers - one of the first films to have a Clean Version released -tweeted,external: ""So now we are being asked if we are okay with our movies being released in a sanitised form. Let me be clear - it is not okay."" ButDigital Trends website said,external: ""This is good news for consumers. Parents get to introduce the kids to some of their favourite films and those without little ones can go ahead and watch them the way they were meant to be seen."" The Directors Guild of America (DGA) has said the ""hard-fought-for rights that protect a director's work and vision"" are ""at the very heart of our craft and a thriving film industry"". They said: ""The DGA has notified Sony that it expects the immediate removal of all 'clean' versions of the affected films from availability until Sony secures permission from each and every director, and provides them with an opportunity to edit a version for release in new media."" We wait to see if any of the films are removed from Sony's list - and if they end up adding more to it, or scrapping the scheme altogether. It will be also interesting to see what the public reaction is to the scheme, as it's not entirely clear who it is aimed at, with many of the films already considered to be suitable for older children - and others perhaps not appealing to a younger audience at all in the first place. But at least film fans can rest assured that they can still watch versions filled with profanity, violence and nudity - if they so desire.

"The two cabinet ministers responsible for social care were informed of plans for the so-called dementia tax just hours before it was announced in the Conservatives' election manifesto. Communities Secretary Sajid Javid and Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt were told less than 24 hours before the launch. Costs of residential and domiciliary care were to be taken from the estates of pensioners bar a final Â£100,000. But it proved so controversial that the proposal was changed within four days. Prime Minister Theresa May embarked on a hasty retreat after Tory candidates complained that the policy was hugely unpopular. She said that an unspecified cap, which she described as an ""absolute limit"", would be imposed on care costs. BBC Two's Newsnight has been told that Mr Hunt and Mr Javid were informed of the proposal for the manifesto at a late hour because future social care policy was being examined in the Cabinet Office rather than in their departments. Ben Gummer, the then Cabinet Office minister who was co-author of the manifesto, was taking the lead in drawing up a Green Paper on social care due for publication later this year. It is understood that the proposal to preserve a maximum of Â£100,000 in estates of pensioners who need residential and domiciliary social care had been examined in great detail ahead of the Green Paper. The cap was due to be included but was still being examined. Cabinet ministers were consulted extensively in other areas of the manifesto. But ministers were only shown the whole document shortly before its launch in Halifax and 20 minutes before the media. And the head of the prime minister's policy board during the election also told Newsnight that he was not even shown a draft of the manifesto. This video can not be played ""This was a catastrophe of a campaign"" - Conservative MP George Freeman George Freeman, the MP for Mid Norfolk, said: ""This was a catastrophe of a campaign and I wouldn't expect necessarily in a snap election it gets signed off by cabinet and it goes through a series of negotiations presumably and discussions. ""So I wouldn't expect to be holding the pen on the last draft. But I didn't see any draft. And I think there was a culture in the campaign of 'we the five or six of us are going to do this'."" Members of Theresa May's inner circle feel deeply bruised by the fallout over the manifesto. Tory sources say that the prime minister was motivated by fairness on social care, asking why a 30-year-old in the north should subsidise the care needs of a pensioner living in a million pound house in the South East.

"A total of 80 people are feared dead after a huge fire engulfed the 24-storey Grenfell tower block in west London, destroying 151 homes. Several questions emerged for the investigation into the disaster, some of which have been answered. Firefighters were called to Grenfell Tower at 00:54 BST on 14 June and the fire was brought under control at 01:14 BST the next day. The fire started in a Hotpoint fridge freezer and the government ordered immediate testing of the appliance. Police said the fire had not been started deliberately and the speed with which the fire spread was ""unexpected"". Fridge freezers and other electrical appliances are a relatively common cause of fires. Anyone who has a white Hotpoint fridge freezer model number FF175BP or graphite fridge freezer model number FF175BG should register their appliance with the manufacturer to receive any updates. It is believed to have started on the fourth floor. What we know so far Tower blocks are designed so fires should stay contained within individual flats. But this clearly did not happen. In 2009, three women and three children were killed by a fire in the 14-storey Lakanal House, in Camberwell, south-east London, which started in a TV set on the ninth floor. Southwark Council admitted it had failed to address fire risks and was fined Â£270,000, plus Â£300,000 in costs. Footage has shown the fire spreading up one side of the building externally, before engulfing the entire block. Fire safety expert Elvin Edwards described it as a ""chimney effect"", adding that the wind would have fanned the flames. Cladding can create cavities which in some cases can cause a chimney effect, drawing flames up the cavity if there are no fire barriers. It is unclear whether Grenfell Tower was fitted with fire barriers. The London Fire Brigade's aerial platform vehicles can reach heights of only about 32m (105ft) - limiting how high up the blaze can be fought. Having to get 20 storeys up to rescue people in that situation ""is just unbelievable"", firefighter turned safety consultant Bob Parkin said. Concerns raised about Grenfell Tower 'for years' Matt Wrack, of the Fire Brigades Union, said something had clearly gone badly wrong with fire prevention procedures at the building. Before and during a recent refurbishment, the localGrenfell Action Group,externalsaid the block constituted a fire risk and residents warned that site access for emergency vehicles was ""severely restricted"". Get news from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning,external The block - which was built in 1974 - did not have a sprinkler system. Under current law, all new residential blocks over 30m high must have sprinkler systems fitted. There is no legal requirement for local authorities to retrofit sprinklers to tower blocks. Ronnie King, honorary secretary of the All-Party Fire Safety and Rescue Group, told LBC Radio there were about 4,000 tower blocks that did not have fire sprinklers fitted. He said after the fire in Lakanal House there had been a ""recommendation, which was down to each local council and landlords to determine the appropriateness"" regarding fitting sprinklers in some blocks. The coroner in the inquest into the fire also recommended that the government encouraged providers of high-rise buildings to consider the retrofitting of sprinkler systems. In Wales, sprinklers are compulsory for all newly-built houses and blocks of flats, as well as care homes and university halls of residence. Grenfell Tower fire: In pictures Paul Fuller, chairman of the Fire Sector Federation, said sprinklers could have helped lessen the impact of the fire. He told BBC Radio 4's World at One programme: ""We know that sprinklers are effective. ""Also, sprinklers will make the environment more survivable by containing the fire and containing the smoke. But they are not a total solution."" The British Automatic Fire Sprinkler Association (BAFSA), the trade body for the fire sprinkler industry, said retrofitting the building with sprinklers might have cost Â£200,000. Rydon Construction carried out the Â£8.6m refurbishment of Grenfell Tower, which was completed in May last year. Kensington and Chelsea council leader Nick Paget-Brown said Grenfell Tower was not fitted with sprinklers during the refurbishment as the authority was told that fires in high-rises should be able to be contained within the flat of origin. He told BBC Newsnight there was also not a ""collective view"" by residents to retrofit sprinklers in all flats as it would have delayed and caused further disruption to the upgrade. Some residents have also reported not hearing fire alarms. Alarms will often go off only on the floor affected, according to fire expert Elfyn Edwards. Rydon Construction, which carried out the refurbishment, said it had delivered a ""number of improvements"" to community facilities and energy efficiency to the building. ""Externally, rain screen cladding, curtain wall facade and replacement windows were fitted, improving thermal insulation and modernising the exterior of the building,"" it said. Fire safety experts have pointed to cladding on the building as a possible reason the blaze spread so quickly externally. The cladding requested for the refurbishment had a metal outer coating and an expanded foam interior. It had a polyethylene - or plastic - core instead of an even more fireproof alternative,BBC Newsnight understands. However, experts told the programme that cladding with a mineral core is considered to be less flammable. The Times reported,externalthat the particular type of cladding used on Grenfell Tower is banned in the US on buildings taller than 40ft (12m) - for fire safety reasons. It says the manufacturer makes two fire-resistant alternatives, but they are more expensive. The paper calculates the difference in cost at Grenfell Tower would have amounted to less than Â£5,000 for the entire building. Grenfell cladding 'linked to other fires' The Department for Communities and Local Government said that if the cladding used was a composite aluminium panel with a polyethylene core, it would be non-compliant with current building regulations guidance. This material should not be used as cladding on buildings over 18m high, the department said. It would not comment on the type used at Grenfell. This would be subject to investigations into the fire's cause, it said. Chancellor Philip Hammondtold the BBC's Andrew Marr Showthat there were two questions to be asked regarding cladding. ""One, are our regulations correct, do they permit the right kind of materials and ban the wrong kind of materials?"" he said. ""The second question is were they correctly complied with? That will be a subject that the inquiry will look at."" Preliminary tests on samples of building insulation showed it burned soon after the test started, and more quickly than the cladding tiles. They both failed the police's safety tests which are similar to those being carried out by the government. The cladding, insulation, fixings and installation will be examined both individually and how they worked together. Police said all criminal charges were being considered ""from manslaughter onwards"" including health and safety and fire offences. Every company involved in the building and refurbishment of Grenfell Tower would also be looked at as part of the investigation, they said. Cladding can be used to improve thermal insulation and energy efficiency within buildings. Some commentators are now asking whether green energy targets are to blame for Grenfell Tower fire. But campaigners for warm homes say the insulation policy is right - it's the implementation that's wrong. That's because insulation has transformed the lives of hundreds of thousands of people in cold damp tower blocks. Comfort has improved, health is better, bills are slashed. Carbon emissions are down. In fact insulation needs to be massively extended as the government strives to reduce fuel poverty and curb carbon emissions. But engineers will need to use insulation that's safe for tower blocks - and then prove to sceptical tenants that it is safe. The Fire Protection Association (FPA), the UK's national fire safety organisation, says that when properly fitted - and with its polyethylene insulation expertly encapsulated - cladding should resist fire. In Dubai, recent high-rise building fires, including at the 79-storey Torch tower in 2015, spread because of cladding, according to fire engineering consultancy Tenable Dubai. Ray Bailey, managing director at Harley Facades Limited, which installed the cladding, has said: ""At this time, we are not aware of any link between the fire and the exterior cladding to the tower."" Rydon said its work met ""all required building regulations, as well as fire regulation and health and safety standards"". A newsletter from Rydon sent to residents after the refurbishment said that smoke detection systems had been ""upgraded and extended"". Local authorities are required to ensure appropriate fire safety procedures are in place in council-run blocks. Inside Housing - a magazine for the UK social housing sector - has reported that information released by Kensington and Chelsea Council under the Freedom of Information Act shows themost recent fire risk assessment,externalon the tower was in December 2015. Kensington and Chelsea Council leader Nick Paget-Brown said high-rise buildings were regularly inspected. A fire action sign from a similar block near Grenfell Tower Residents of tower blocks such as Grenfell Tower, whose flats are not affected by fire or smoke, are usually advised to stay in place. Safety standards are meant to contain fires to the individual flat affected and keep stairwells and hallways free of smoke for some time, says Graham Fieldhouse, allowing the fire to be fought and evacuations carefully managed. ""[Firefighters] don't need hundreds of people coming down the stairs when they are trying to fight the fire,"" the fire safety expert told the BBC. Why are people told to 'stay put'? Geoff Wilkinson, a fire and building inspector, told the BBC that one of his ""major concerns"" was that smoke seemed to have spread into escape routes. A number of witnesses have told the BBC that hours after the fire first broke out, residents were still being told to stay in their flats and await for the fire service. A nationwide operation to identify buildings with cladding like that used in Grenfell Tower has seen local authorities urgently assessing their tower blocks for fire safety. Councils have been sending in samples of cladding used in their high-rise blocks to see if they are dangerous. They are trying to establish whether any materials used are the same as or similar to those thought to have caused the Grenfell fire. In total, 259 high-rise blocks have now been found with cladding that raises concerns. In Camden in north London, residents have been evacuated from four tower blocks over fire safety concerns. The Communities Secretary, Sajid Javid, has also said safety checks are also urgently needed in hospitals, offices and private buildings and said NHS England was in contact with around 200 health trusts to check cladding on hospitals.

"A number of Gulf countries have closed their airspace to Qatar Airways Gulf residents are still in shock. Qatar, a sovereign Arab state, is being subjected to unprecedented sanctions by its Gulf Arab neighbours, led by Saudi Arabia. The punishing economic and diplomatic measures have been taken because of allegations that Qatar has persisted in funding terrorist groups and destabilising the region, both of which it denies. So now airspace has been closed, imports stopped at borders, Qatari expatriates expelled. The veneer of Gulf Arab unity, as embodied in the Gulf Co-operation Council (GCC), has worn off. Why is Turkey standing up for Qatar? Why Qatar is the focus of terrorism claims What's behind the row? Even if, as expected, the immediate crisis is resolved by talks, the Gulf will never be the same again. Now there are fears this action may push this region down a new and dangerous path. The action against Qatar has been initiated by Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt - four countries ruled by Sunni Muslim leaderships that see the world through the prism of two major threats to their rule: Iran and political Islam, coupled with violent jihad. They accuse Qatar of encouraging both strands. On Iran, the quartet's complaint appears to be excessive. Qatar shares with Iran the world's largest natural gas condensate field - the offshore South Pars/North Dome Field. Geography has made them neighbours, they need to get on. But Saudi Arabia's rulers, encouraged by President Donald Trump's recent visit to Riyadh and his strong condemnation of Tehran, would prefer to see a united Gulf Arab stand against its arch rival Iran. Qatar, in their eyes, is ""letting the side down"". On political Islam, it is easier to see why the dynastic monarchies of the Gulf feel threatened by Qatar's actions. Qatar's ruling family, the Al-Thani's, have long supported the Muslim Brotherhood, which espouses a pan-Islamic caliphate that would ultimately do away with current rulers. Qatar has backed Islamist movements in Egypt, Libya, Syria and the Gaza Strip. They have allowed the country's satellite TV channel, Al-Jazeera, to host vocal critics of Arab leaders, although not Qatar's. The UAE Crown Prince, Sheikh Mohammed Bin Zayed Al-Nahyan, told me he sees the Muslim Brotherhood as an existential threat to the region. On terrorism, the picture is more opaque. Saudi Arabia and its allies accuse Qatar of funding terrorist groups, notably in Syria and Iraq. A lot of people say this is a case of hypocrisy, of the pot calling the kettle black. Saudi Deputy Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman is said to be leading the anti-Qatar charge In a failed bid to topple Syria's President Bashar al-Assad, Saudi Arabia has itself funnelled hundreds of millions of dollars to hardline Sunni fighters in Syria, some of which has ended up in the hands of so-called Islamic State. There is no denying though, that Qatar has had connections to the al-Qaeda-linked al-Nusra Front in Syria. On one of my visits to the Qatari capital, Doha, Qatari intelligence officials personally told me in 2014 how they had successfully brought about the release of hostages held by this group. That group would naturally have demanded something substantial in exchange. In April this year it has been reported that a staggering $1bn (Â£784m) ransom was paid by Qatar to terrorist groups in Iraq, some of it to Iran, in order to secure the release of 26 princes kidnapped while hunting a large game bird called a bustard. Qatar denies it. While the action to isolate and punish Qatar reflects a joint view held by several countries, leading the charge is the 31-year-old Saudi Deputy Crown Prince and Defence Minister, Mohammed Bin Salman, known as MBS. The question many are asking now is whether MBS has gone too far. Saudi Arabia already has enough trouble on its hands. Together with the UAE, it's spent the last two years fighting an inconclusive and deeply destructive war in Yemen. It's coping with a simmering insurgency in its Shia-dominated Eastern Province. It is still part of the US-led coalition against IS, a group that has already bombed several Saudi mosques and threatened more attacks only this month. The real long term cost of isolating Qatar may well turn out to be economic. To attract business and provide jobs for their swelling youth population, the Gulf Arab states need stability and a business-friendly environment. It is hard to see how this stand-off could do more to damage this. The longer it persists, the deeper the wounds, not just to Qatar and its tiny, affluent population, but to the entire region.

"Gary Berman believes the hackers were disgruntled former employees As our ""smart"" homes fill up with internet-connected devices, the risk grows that hackers will find weak points in our networks, steal our data and hijack our lives. What should we be doing about it? It's not normally a good idea to sign off your Powerpoint presentation pitching for work with an expletive. But this is what Gary Berman did - albeit unknowingly. Hackers had broken in to his home network via an internet-connected printer and sabotaged his files. Instead of signing off with ""thank you"", the hackers changed the first word to something offensive. Unsurprisingly Gary, a Miami-based marketing entrepreneur, didn't win the $400,000 contract he was pitching for. ""Who would think your printer could be used as an access point to your networks?"" he tells the BBC. The trouble began last year when he noticed strange things happening: files went missing from his computer; his Facebook picture was changed; and texts from his daughter didn't reach him or arrived changed. ""Nobody believed me,"" says Gary. ""My wife and my brother thought I had lost my mind. They scheduled an appointment with a psychiatrist for me."" Is that snazzy smart coffee maker actually a weak point in your home network? But he built up a body of evidence and called in a professional cybersecurity firm. It found that his email addresses had been compromised, his phone records hacked and altered, and an entire virtual internet interface created. ""All my communications were going through a man-in-the-middle unauthorised server,"" he explains. The cybersecurity firm changed and strengthened all the passwords for any connected devices on his home network and installed the latest generation firewall. Now Gary puts his alarming experience to good use as a victim's advocate, volunteering for the Institute of Responsible Online and Cell Phone Communication (IROC2), a non-profit organisation educating children about cyber safety and security. ""I know I'm not alone,"" he says. The risk of cyber-attack is growing along with the number of connected gadgets in the home - from thermostats to light bulbs, music systems to security cameras. While controlling your heating and lighting remotely with a smartphone might be convenient, if you're not switched-on to the security implications you could end up paying a high price for this convenience. ""Consumers understand if they purchase a product or service from a high-end brand, that product will have most likely been well-engineered and be relatively secure,"" says Michael Philpott of consultancy Ovum's smart home research team. ""But at the same time they probably don't fully understand the consequences and potential risks of introducing other, cheaper products into their homes."" Could you cope with smartphone rationing? Are Google, Amazon and others getting too big? How Facebook's tentacles reach further than you think WannaCry: What can you do to protect your business? Click here for more Technology of Business features,external Indeed, Symantec's latest internet security threat report finds that 40% of people are not ""sufficiently aware"" of the threats, and 79% say they have not even read a news article on the subject. Yet poor security can have serious consequences, as Gary Berman discovered. The UK'sNational Cyber Security Centre has demonstratedhow a connected doll could be hacked and used to open remote control door locks. Andpoorly secured security cameras have been hijacked to carry out web attacks. The number of connected devices in our homes is growing fast Brian Geisel, chief executive of US internet of things (IoT) firm Geisel Software, argues that when it comes to the connected home, we are in similar position to the early days of laptop computers, when ""virus scanners were just starting to emerge and home firewalls weren't even on the radar yet"". ""IoT is in the same situation, where individuals with malicious intent are now acting faster than companies and consumers,"" he says. It doesn't help that there are few internationally agreed security standards for these devices or that the tech giants - Google, Apple, Amazon, Samsung - are fighting to dominate the home market with their own systems. So what should we be doing about it? The standard advice is to change all the default usernames and passwords on our connected devices and make sure the firmware has been updated to the latest versions. ""Just the simple step of changing that default username and password - to anything else - is a huge step in the right direction,"" Mr Geisel says. ""Obviously, it's much better if you use a good password [a mix of upper and lower case letters, numbers and symbols] and have different passwords on different devices, but just getting a baseline of security is hugely important."" Mr Geisel also advises being behind a firewall at all times. But for many non-technical people this is easier said than done. Even remembering passwords is difficult enough, which is why a password manager can be a good idea. Smart firewall: Cujo's ""eyes"" open when it detects suspect activity on your home network These services generate and store strong passwords for each online device and account that you access. All you need to remember is your master password. Providers include LastPass, Dashlane, Sticky Password and LogMeOnce. But Craig Spiezle, head of the Online Trust Alliance (OTA) at the Internet Society, says: ""Expecting a home user to be a security expert is not reasonable. ""This is where we see the promise of 'dashboards' that can control all of the devices and alert users when a device may no longer be secure or is no longer being supported."" This means handing over your home network security to a trusted third party, either plugging in an extra box to your wi-fi router or replacing it with a security company's own router. Earlier this year,Symantec and Intel announcedthey were entering this market, joining existing providers such as BitDefender, Cujo, Home Halo, Eero, Idappcom, Trend Micro and others. Typically, you can monitor your network via an app and also set parental controls to block access to certain devices or websites completely or within time limits you set. But such guardians come at a price, typically Â£100 to Â£300 for the hardware, and often annual subscriptions on top. If this is beyond your budget, you should at least consider encrypting important files and storing them on a separate hard drive that isn't wi-fi enabled, or at least keeping them in a password-protected folder. Your home may be getting smarter; just make sure it's also getting safer.
