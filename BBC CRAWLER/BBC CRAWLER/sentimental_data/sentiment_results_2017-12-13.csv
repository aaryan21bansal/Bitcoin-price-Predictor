"Salma Hayek, seen here promoting Frida in 2003, which she starred in and co-produced Actress Salma Hayek has described Hollywood mogul Harvey Weinstein as a rage-fuelled ""monster"", alleging he sexually harassed and threatened her. Writing in the New York Times,external, Hayek said Weinstein once told her: ""I will kill you, don't think I can't."" Holly Baird, a spokeswoman for Weinstein, disputed Hayek's account. Dozens of actresses, including Rose McGowan, Angelina Jolie and Gwyneth Paltrow, have accused Weinstein of harassment or assault. Weinstein denies all allegations of non-consensual sex. How Weinstein scandal unfolded Writing in the New York Times, Hayek, 51, described working with the film mogul on what she called her ""greatest ambition"" - telling the story of Mexican artist Frida Kahlo. She wrote that, after striking a deal with Weinstein for the rights of the film that would eventually become 2002's Frida, she was forced to repeatedly refuse sexual advances. ""No to me taking a shower with him. ""No to letting him watch me take a shower. ""No to letting him give me a massage. ""No to letting a naked friend of his give me a massage. ""No to letting him give me oral sex. ""No to my getting naked with another woman,"" she wrote. She went on to accuse him of threatening to shut the film down unless she filmed a nude sex scene with another actress. ""I had to take a tranquilizer, which eventually stopped the crying but made the vomiting worse,"" she wrote of her emotional turmoil at filming a scene she thought unnecessary. ""As you can imagine, this was not sexy, but it was the only way I could get through the scene."" Weinstein's spokeswoman said in a statement: ""Mr Weinstein does not recall pressuring Salma to do a gratuitous sex scene with a female co-star and he was not there for the filming."" ""All of the sexual allegations as portrayed by Salma are not accurate and others who witnessed the events have a different account of what transpired."" Frida would eventually gather six Oscar nominations, including a Best Actress nod for Hayek. Mr Weinstein has been accused of rape, sexual assault and harassment, but has ""unequivocally denied"" any allegations of non-consensual relationships.

"University leaders have been under pressure over high salaries University leaders have agreed to a new code on senior pay, which is expected to be published in the next few weeks. University representatives held a meeting with minister Jo Johnson on Wednesday where they accepted the need for more accountability. It follows fierce criticism of university leaders over claims of excessive senior pay, withthe head of the University of Bath stepping down. Mr Johnson says ""public confidence"" over pay had to be restored. The universities minister met leaders of Universities UK, the Russell Group and the Committee of University Chairs - with Mr Johnson calling for more restraint over pay. It is understood that a ""fair remuneration code"" will be published in January for university leaders, by the Committee of University Chairs. Mr Johnson told university leaders that there must be a more transparent and independent system for the setting of senior salaries - and an end to the ""upwards ratchet in pay"". He set out a series of requirements, including that vice chancellors must not sit on the committee that decides their pay. Jo Johnson has told universities they need to restore public confidence There will also have to be disclosure of benefits, such as subsidised housing and expenses. The size of pay gaps between university heads and academic staff will also have to be published. ""It is vital that pay arrangements command public confidence and deliver value for money for students and taxpayers,"" said Mr Johnson. Universities, under increasing public pressure and protests from their own academic staff, say they also want to ""rebuild public confidence"". ""We agree more needs to be done to ensure the process for deciding senior pay is viewed as open and accountable,"" a Russell Group spokesperson said. The group of leading universities says it is backing ""a new code to ensure pay-setting arrangements are as rigorous and transparent as they can be"". Universities UK said ""competitive pay is necessary to attract first rate leaders"" but a new code would be a ""welcome step"". ""As universities receive funding from taxpayers and through student fees, it is reasonable to expect pay decisions to be fair, accountable and justified,"" said a Universities UK spokesman. Mr Johnson last week warned the university sector that it needed to get pay under control - and that a new regulator would be used to enforce this. There have been a series of protests over vice-chancellors' pay in recent weeks - including at the University of Bath, the University of Southampton and at Bath Spa. ""Has there been a problem? Most definitely,"" said Mr Johnson last week. But he said universities now recognised the need to answer public concerns about value for money. ""I think they really are starting to get it.""

"Brexit ministers face questions from MPs It comes after government loses key Brexit vote last night MPs hear statement on forthcoming business Backbench business debates on hormone pregnancy tests and WASPI pensions Peers question government ministers on probation service Debates later on vulnerable children; and poverty Esther Webber and Richard Morris The UK and EU begin a new relationship on 1 January 2021. Theresa May, Jeremy Corbyn and Nicola Sturgeon opt for more traditional festive greetings. Labour's Keir Starmer has called the Brexit vote, in which the government was defeated over amendment 7 last night, a ""humiliating and entirely avoidable defeat"". The shadow Brexit secretary asked for a reassurance that the government will not seek to overturn the decision at report stage during Brexit questions in the Commons. David Davis said the effect of the vote was to see the powers available under section 9 deferred until after Royal Assent is given to the government's yet to be introduced Withdrawal and Implementation Bill. He said it would have the effect of compressing the timetable. The government wants to see a working statute book, as we leave the EU, he said, but as always we take the House of Commons view seriously. Keir Starmer called on the government to drop amendment 381 - this is the amendment which will put the date of exit on the bill. Rather than repeat last night's debacle, ""drop this gimmick"", he said. Hormone pregnancy tests debates House of CommonsParliament Chris Skidmore, Cabinet Office minister, says the issue was first raised in the House in 1978 when he was four years old. He says the government's priority is, and always will be, the safety of NHS patients. The government have ruled out no options, he says. The most recent publication is the most exhaustive examination of the issue to date, he adds. He apologises to the expert who contributed to the working group, previously mentioned by Sir Mike Penning, who feels that his contribution ""has been used inappropriately"". He finishes by saying ""nothing is off the table, and I am listening"". Sir Mike Penning wraps up the debate, saying ""there has to be an independent public inquiry, and if that inquiry decides it needs further evidence it needs to have the finance to do that"".   That's where we leave our coverage of the Commons and Lords for tonight. Thank you for joining us and we'll be back next week. Hormone pregnancy tests debate House of CommonsParliament Sharon Hodgson, shadow health minister, says ""the main sticking point"" of the review is that the working group did not find a causal link between the drug and problems. She says that evidence suggests that people need to be more ""critical"" of what was found by the working group. It can be argued that there were inconsistencies in the data used by the working group, she says. She says that in her research between two different drugs, the drug being debated today, Primodos, shows a much higher prevalence of problems. ""I'm no scientific professional, but the red flags that arise when reading what the evidence says and what the conclusions were drawn from them, are not ones that I believe only an expert in this field would see,"" she says. In closing, she says she hopes the debate takes them one step further. Hormone pregnancy tests debate House of CommonsParliament Hannah Bardell is summing up for the SNP. She says one of her constituents says that ""her life has been turned upside down"" and she shares more experiences she has heard of birth deformities and miscarriages. The drug was on the market ""unregulated, and untested, for five years"", she says. The SNP MP says that some visitors to the final press conference at the publication of the last report were locked out, herself and Yasmin Qureshi included. Allow Twitter content?

Hormone pregnancy tests debate House of CommonsParliament Liberal Democrat Sir Ed Davey tells the Commons of his constituent, whose daughter has struggled with poor health her whole life. He says the situation is ""a whole cover up, over a number of years""; and says he reads minutes and memos of meetings between company doctors and lawyers in Berlin. The minutes show that the lawyers and company knew of the problems with the drug, he says. ""He has to stand up to the official briefings he's getting,"" he tells the minister. Hormone pregnancy tests debate House of CommonsParliament Yasmin Qureshi with hormone pregnancy test campaigners Labour's Yasmin Qureshi, who has campaigned on this issue, says that a constituent contacting her about her poor health after her mother had taken the test during pregnancy. Ms Qureshi says that in her research, she uncovered research by a doctor that in cases where the mother had taken the test, ""there was a higher incidence of malformed babies, miscarriages, stillbirths and infant deaths"". His findings were so alarming that he wrote to the manufacturers, but she says it took another eight years before it was withdrawn from the market. She says she has raised the issue in the House many times with the current and previous prime ministers. During the inquiry established in 2014, witnesses and affected people ""were treated appallingly"", she says. She also tells the House an observer appointed to the inquiry was made to sign a gagging clause, meaning that she could not raise any concerns about the investigation. Hormone pregnancy tests debate House of CommonsParliament Conservative Sir Mike Penning is opening the second of today's backbench debates, this time on hormone pregnancy tests. He says that often these pills were taken in a GP's office, handed to them for free by drug companies. The tests became prevalent in the 1950s, 60s and 70s. He says the Royal College of GPs had informed the Department for Health in the 1960s that they were then concerned about the drugs. Sir Mike calls for an independent judge led inquiry to settle the matter. He says that a previous scientific review into the matter misrepresented one of the witness's opinions and contributions to the evidence. He says he wants to know why the drug company settled their lawsuit in America, and then ""gagged everything"". Pensions equality for women debate House of CommonsParliament Shadow work and pensions secretary Debbie Abrahams calls on the government to work with the affected women to come to a good solution. She says that life expectancy in people above 60 is decreasing. Work and Pensions Minister Guy Opperman says that improvements in life expectancy are to be welcomed, but it ""also brings enormous pressures"". In July, the government published its first review into the state pension age, and the government accepts the recommendations in the review which sees the pension age to be increased from 67 to 68 in 2039. Mr Opperman says that Ms Abrahams is ""scaremongering"" about life expectancy, and says that according to the Office for National Statistics, life expectancy is increasing. Pensions equality for women debate House of CommonsParliament The government are ""spinning in circles"", says the SNP's pensions spokesperson Mhairi Black. She says that it's still refusing to acknowledge the problems that women face. She criticises the fact that the onus is on women to contact the Department for Work and Pensions. ""We are trying to move society forward, and it's not going to get anywhere if the response is always, 'yeah, well we looked at that, it was rubbish, but let's move on',"" she says. She wants Parliamentarians to focus on how to fix the problem, rather than this ""blame game,"" she says. Pensions equality for women debate House of CommonsParliament The SNP's Patricia Gibson tells the Commons she has struggled to frame her debate in terms that haven't already been used. She says the life expectancy of women is not the issue today, she wants the minister to respond more on terms of how much notice was given to these women. She says the minister has said ""can we afford it,"" but she wants to say ""we cannot afford not to afford it,"" she adds. The social contract has been ""torn up"" by this government cruelly and callously, she says. BBC Scotland editor tweets Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Pensions equality for women debate House of CommonsParliament Liberal Democrat Stephen Lloyd tells the Commons that all political parties are culpable and ""have let women down"". ""From 1995 to 2009, there was no communication at all,"" he says, this was 14 years in which the DWP could have told women and they could have prepared, he adds. He says he believes the government should make available ""a flat sum of transition money"", and he makes a proposal, which he believes businesses would support, which is to delay the implementation of the corporation tax cut, which would raise the money to help WASPI women, he says. He calls for a ""proper vote"" for the Commons on the issue, to resolve it. Causes of poverty debate House of LordsParliament Crossbencher and Big Issue founder Lord Bird is opening a debate on the root causes of poverty. He says it's fitting that this is taking place six months after Grenfell, as we need to ""ensure the likes of Grenfell Tower never happen again"". He tells the House: ""People in social housing should not be living in the third world."" He observes that ""we like to hear stories about indomitable spirit of someone who does not accept poverty"", noting: ""My own family knew how to drink, smoke cigarettes and avoid paying the rent."" He says he's focused on ""calling the bluff on poverty"" as he believes there's a tendency towards ""emergency-ism, where we spend lots of money on the problem once it's happened"" and ""we need a revolution to shake it up"". He concludes: ""I don't read reports - I go into the street at 2am or 3am and talk to people,"" and he's convinced of the need to tackle ""the poverty of the responses to poverty"".

Background Reality Check During the election, politicians were keen to pledge support for women born in the 1950s who have been angered by rises in the age at which they qualify for a state pension. Millions of women have been caught up in government efforts to cut the mounting costs of paying for the state pension and to equalise the age at which men and women receive the state pension. That effort goes back decades, so here is a little history. Read more here. The Sun's Westminster correspondent tweets Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Pension equality for women debate House of CommonsParliament Conservative Anne-Marie Trevelyan tells the House that changes have been made ""without enough time to prepare"". She says many of the women affected have worked all their lives, and now circumstances mean that, with ill-health in particular, they are struggling to survive on what they have. These problems are exacerbated for people who live in rural areas, she adds. She says listening to all the stories from women has been ""beyond frustrating"", and the Department for Work and Pensions is ""unwilling to engage"" with the All-Party Parliamentary Group on WASPI women. David Davis was not in contempt of Parliament but some of his actions were ""regrettable"", says Speaker. Â© 2025 BBC.

"The former UKIP leader suggested the UK had caved in over the ""divorce bill"" and citizens' rights The UK has ""danced to the EU's tune"" during the Brexit negotiations, former UKIP leader Nigel Farage has claimed. In a debate in Strasbourg, he called the British Prime Minister, Theresa May, ""Theresa the appeaser"", saying she had ""given in on virtually everything"". The European Parliament later voted to endorse an agreement struck by the UK and European Commission which is set to move the talks on to their next phase. But MEPs also insisted the UK must honour the commitments it has made. Amid concerns about whether Friday's agreement on citizens' rights, the Northern Ireland border and the so-called ""divorce bill"" is legally binding, Guy Verhofstadt, the European Parliament's Brexit spokesman, said he had been reassured the UK would not ""back-track"" on its commitments. Live: MEPs debate Brexit withdrawal issues Rebellion threat to key EU bill Reality Check: Theresa May's deal with Brussels The agreement should be converted into a legal text in weeks, not months, he added. In a symbolic but politically significant vote, the European Parliament backed the European Commission's view that sufficient progress had been made on so-called divorce issues to move to talks covering a transition phase and the EU's future relations with the UK. The EU's negotiator  Michel Barnier said there was ""no going back"" on Friday's agreement - which is expected to be rubber-stamped by all other 27 EU members later this week. ""It has been noted and recorded and is going to have to be translated into a legally binding withdrawal agreement,"" he said. During the debate, several MEPs criticised the UK's Brexit Secretary, David Davis, for suggesting in an interview on Sunday that the first-phase agreement was more of a ""statement of intent"" than a ""legally enforceable thing"" - comments he has since backed away from. German Christian Democrat MEP Manfred Weber, who leads the centre-right EPP group, said the remarks were ""not helpful"" for building trust between the two sides. Meanwhile, Mr Farage - who has campaigned for 20 years to take the UK out of the EU - also attacked the British government, saying Mr Barnier ""didn't need"" to make many concessions to Theresa May. ""I'm not surprised you're all very pleased with Theresa the appeaser - who has given in on virtually everything,"" he said. ""She has danced to your tune all the way through this. You must be very, very happy indeed."" Warning of a further betrayal of Brexit voters, he said the prospect of a two-year transition after the UK left in March 2019 would be the ""biggest deception yet"", meaning the UK would have left the EU ""in name only"". ""I think Brexit at some point in the future may need to be refought all over again,"" he added. But defending the British prime minister, Conservative MEP Syed Kamall said both sides had needed to make compromises and concessions in order to ""avoid a no-deal situation"". Important progress had been made, he added, when both sides ""understood the need for flexibility and focused on building a better future rather than looking back at the past"".

"Well, well, well. The Tory rebels, and the government, believed that a last-minute panicked concession from the government side had walked Theresa May back from the brink of defeat. Frantic conversations between the government, the whips, the party managers and their MPs who were tempted to rebel had been taking place all day. We saw cabinet ministers take MPs aside - for just a quiet chat of course - in the closing moments of the vote. May heads to Brussels after EU vote loss And during the voting, which always takes about 15 minutes, some of those who were tempted tweeted that they had decided to abstain - the last minute promise from the minister, Dominic Raab, had changed their minds or delayed the clash. We saw as one of the possible rebels, a new Scottish MP, Paul Masterton, was cajoled by the Defence Secretary, Gavin Williamson (the chief whip until weeks ago) - then after the conversation, picked up his mobile phone and tweeted that he was going to abstain. But the arm twisting and arguments failed. As the MPs who count the votes made their way to the Speaker's chair, the opposition teller made their way to the outside of the despatch box. It's a physical signal of telling MPs who has won before the official announcement takes place. As that happened the House of Commons erupted - well at least the Labour side. Ministers looked like they felt sick. The deputy speaker had to call for silence so the chamber could hear the actual result. Total silence, and then disbelief as the result was read out. The government had been beaten after all, by only four votes. It's the first time that Theresa May has been defeated on her own business in the Commons. She has to front up in Brussels tomorrow with other EU leaders only hours after an embarrassing loss in Parliament. Beyond the red faces in government tonight, does it really matter? Ministers tonight are divided on that. Two cabinet ministers have told me while it's disappointing it doesn't really matter in the big picture. It's certainly true that the Tory party is so divided over how we leave the EU that the Parliamentary process was always going to be very, very choppy. But another minister told me the defeat is ""bad for Brexit"" and was openly frustrated and worried about their colleagues' behaviour. It's possible too that it was a miscalculation that could have been avoided. Had the minister at the despatch box put forward the concession even a few hours earlier, that tiny number of votes might have gone the other way. This is only the first big piece of legislation related to our withdrawal from the EU and it has run into trouble. And one of the leading Tory rebels predicted the government will have to drop one of its other plans, to put a Brexit date in the withdrawal bill, next week. The broader risk for May is not just that she will have to budge on this particular issue, but that the small group of rebels in the Tory party is strengthened by actually having had this kind of impact - and the opposition parties are already emboldened. Theresa May had been having her first good week in many, many months. That brief respite just might have come to an end. Stephen Hammond, one of the rebels, has just been sacked from his position as deputy Conservative Party chairman. Tonight, no-one is playing nice.

"Samuel Armstrong has claimed what happened took place with ""full consent"" A woman who claims she was raped by an MP's chief of staff in Westminster gave the story to journalists hours after the alleged attack, a jury has heard. Samuel Armstrong, of Danbury, Essex, denies two charges of rape and two of sexual assault on 14 October 2016. Southwark Crown Court heard the woman sent a message to her boyfriend. ""Keeping you in the loop. I've given it to Harry Cole who works for the Sun. It will either be in the Mail on Sunday or the Sun front page on Monday,"" it said. Jurors were told the message was sent 15 hours after the alleged assault, and a later message said: ""The media already knew so this is my way of controlling it to ensure I get a sympathetic writer."" When Sarah Forshaw QC, defending, asked the woman, a parliamentary worker in her 20s, about the messages, she insisted she did not sell the story and explained it had been a friend who spoke to the Sun. She said: ""I really didn't want my identity to come out and it was a state where I had absolutely no control in the event, so I wanted a little bit of control."" The court has heard claims the attack happened in the early hours in the Westminster office of South Thanet MP Craig Mackinlay after the woman fell asleep there after a night drinking. The woman said Mr Armstrong, 24, of Copt Hill, called her a ""bitch"" and raped her twice after she turned down an invitation to go back to his flat in Clapham, south London. It is claimed the attack happened in the Westminster office of South Thanet MP Craig Mackinlay Ms Forshaw suggested the woman became distressed when she tried to leave Westminster after having consensual sex with Mr Armstrong. ""When it was over you were not upset with him at all, were you?"" she asked. But the woman answered: ""Yes - I was completely confused and devastated in the truest sense of that word."" The woman admitted sending a request to Mr Armstrong to follow him on Twitter in September 2017 but said it was an accident. Ms Forshaw suggested to the victim she had told a lie at the time, but once she had told it she couldn't take it back, and the woman told her she was ""incorrect"". The defence lawyer also put it to her that everything that happened in Mr Mackinlay's office was with her consent, but the woman answered: ""No, absolutely not."" Mr Armstrong's defence lawyer suggested the woman became distressed as she left The court has heard the pair were at the sports and social bar on the evening of 13 October, before they went to the roof garden terrace to see Big Ben. Jurors heard they later went to the leader's terrace in the Lords' office to drink wine, before taking a bottle back to Mr Mackinlay's office in the Norman Shaw building. The court heard suggestions the pair mutually kissed as they danced to jazz music in the office, before they had consensual sex - a claim the woman denied. She also denied a suggestion she had swept papers on to the floor so they could continue on a desk. Ms Forshaw said to the woman: ""Far from being unhappy during this sexual encounter, you and he were chatting during sex?"" The defence barrister asked the woman if she remembered Mr Armstrong saying something like ""how does the size suit the lady?"" - but the alleged victim replied ""no"". Ms Forshaw added: ""You said that it suited you well. Do you remember that?"" The woman again replied: ""No."" Jurors heard from cleaner Vincent Ble who said the woman was ""shaking and crying"" when he saw her. He said she held on to him while his manager called the police. And the jury heard the phone call made on the parliamentary network in which the sobbing woman told an officer she was ""forced upon"", before she added: ""I got taken back, I don't know.... and I've just had sex and I really, really didn't want to.""

"Donald Tusk said the EU needed to show ""unity"" in the next phase of talks The UK and the EU face a ""furious race against time"" to finalise Brexit talks before March 2019, the head of the European Council says. Donald Tusk urged EU leaders to show unity as they try to negotiate what the future relationship will look like and to set up transitional arrangements. The EU is set to agree this week that enough progress has been made so far to move on from the first phase of talks. The UK has been told not to ""backtrack"" on last week's divorce deal. The comment from EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier came after UK Brexit Secretary David Davis suggested the divorce agreement unveiled by Theresa May amounted to a ""statement of intent"" rather than a binding agreement. Mr Davis - the UK's Brexit secretary - said he was quoted out of context. But European Parliament negotiator Guy Verhofstadt said the ""unacceptable remarks"" would harm ""good faith"" in the process. Applying to stay in UK 'will take minutes' Gove: Brexit will work for animals Brexit: All you need to know The UK is set to leave the EU in March 2019, two years after Mrs May served formal notice of Brexit. Both sides hope to finalise a deal by October 2018 on the future relationship, including trade, so the UK and European Parliaments have time to vote on it before the UK leaves. In his formal letter on Tuesday inviting leaders to this week's EU summit, Mr Tusk told the 27 member states: ""This will be a furious race against time, where again our unity will be key."" On Sunday, Mr Davis said guarantees on the Northern Ireland border - included in a joint EU-UK report published on Friday - were not legally binding unless the two sides reached a final deal. But he told LBC Radio on Monday they would be honoured whatever happened. A European Commission spokesman said the first-phase deal on the Northern Ireland border, the divorce bill and citizens' rights did not strictly have the force of law. ""But we see the joint report of Michel Barnier and David Davis as a deal between gentlemen and it is the clear understanding that it is fully backed and endorsed by the UK government."" The Brexit secretary's comments at the weekend about the legality of what's been agreed so far between the UK and the EU have been widely noted in Brussels, and a handful of member states have brought them up with me. ""To say we are annoyed is putting it too strongly, though,"" said one diplomat. ""This is the sort of stuff we expected,"" said another. ""It's never good when someone questions an agreement 24 hours after it was done,"" a third official suggested. This forms the backdrop to the discussion taking place among EU ministers about the European Council's draft guidelines for Phase 2 of the Brexit talks. But it is not clear if it will lead to any changes to the draft text that will be discussed by leaders on Friday morning. The document already states in its first paragraph that progress in phase 2 of the talks is contingent on commitments from phase 1 being kept. Mr Verhofstadt has tabled two amendments for MEPs to debate on Wednesday, one of which says Mr Davis's comments risk undermining ""the good faith that has been built during the negotiations"". Another amendment calls on Britain to ""fully respect"" last week's Brexit deal and ensure it is ""fully translated"" into a draft Withdrawal Agreement.

And at a press conference in Brussels, he said the UK must ""stick to its commitments"" and put them into a draft Withdrawal Agreement ""as soon as possible"" if there is to be progress in the second phase of talks.

"Ms Dugdale made no comment to journalists when she returned to the Scottish Parliament on Wednesday afternoon Scottish Labour has given its former leader a written warning over her controversial appearance on I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here!. But the party said Kezia Dugdale would face no further disciplinary action after her stint on the reality TV show. Ms Dugdale flew into Glasgow Airport from Australia just before midday. She then met party bosses, including her successor Richard Leonard, and was formally reprimanded over her ""unauthorised absence"". Ms Dugdale later arrived at Holyrood in time for a vote at 17:00, and made no comment to waiting journalists when she left the chamber a short time later. A statement subsequently released by Scottish Labour said Ms Dugdale had been interviewed by its parliamentary group executive. Ms Dugdale insisted she had used her time in the jungle to promote Labour values The statement added: ""Following a discussion between Richard Leonard, Kezia Dugdale, and the group executive, it has been decided that the group will reprimand Ms Dugdale by way of written warning. She will not face further action."" It quoted Ms Dugdale as saying that she had ""deep regret"" that her appearance on the reality show had ""caused issues in the first weeks of Richard Leonard's leadership"", and that she was now ""getting back to work"". Ms Dugdale, who faced criticism over her three-week absence from the Scottish Parliament while appearing on the show, had earlier said it was ""good to be back"" in Scotland as she arrived at the airport, The MSP was the second contestant to be voted off the ITV show, which was won by Made in Chelsea star Georgia Toffolo. She spent a week in Australia after being evicted from the jungle - and has pledged to donate a percentage of her appearance fee to charity, but has not said exactly how much. She took her seat in the Holyrood chamber in time for a vote at the end of the day's business Voting statisticsreleased by the programme,externalshowed that Ms Dugdale won just 1.67% of the votes on the day she was evicted. As she arrived in Glasgow, Ms Dugdale said the experience was one she was never going to forget. The politician, who remained in Australia until after the programme's final on Sunday, had said she wanted to use her appearance to reach out to young people about political values. Asked if she felt she had in fact promoted Labour values she replied: ""I did so in the jungle and will continue to do so."" Ms Dugdale arrived back in Glasgow earlier on Wednesday after three weeks in Australia Ms Dugdale, who was not suspended despite fierce criticism from some within Scottish Labour, has acknowledged she has ""a bit of work to do to make amends"". She previously told the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme it was difficult to seek approval for her appearance on the show during the leadership contest between Richard Leonard and Anas Sarwar. The election, triggered by her resignation in August, was won by Mr Leonard - who immediately expressed his disappointment at Ms Dugdale's decision, which was made public just hours before the leadership result was announced. Mr Leonard said at the time that the party would consider suspending Ms Dugdale - but UK Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said hedid not believe suspension would be appropriate. After being voted out on the jungle, Ms Dugdale said: ""I do understand that it's controversial, I do understand there are lots of people at home that are unhappy that I've taken part in this programme and I've got a bit of work to do to make amends. ""But please don't doubt the fact that I'm devoted to the Labour Party, I love my job and I think I'm better-placed to do it for a long time now having had this experience.""

"Brexit Secretary David Davis is trying to steer the EU bill through Parliament - Dominic Grieve wants to amend it No government likes losing. And the prospect of defeat takes on a whole new meaning for governments who don't have majorities. In other times, it's not that unusual for governments to lose votes on amendments, take stock and then alter their legislation. It's part of the system, however messy it gets. But Theresa May's government, without a majority of its own, has been marked by trying to avoid defeat in the Commons by folding, budging, or making new promises to avoid losing actual votes (caveat - the government has lost opposition day debates, when they have refused to vote at all, but it's a very different picture on getting their own business done). Brexit talks 'a furious race against time' For vulnerable governments, to lose is potentially much more dangerous than the odd defeat for governments who are secure in the level of their support. It's in that context that the government faces a potential defeat on Wednesday on the Withdrawal Bill and must weigh up its best course of action. The legislation has been grinding its way through the Commons for weeks. Tory rebels have threatened to vote against the government on a few different occasions. This time however, with the rebellion led by one of the most unlikely troublemakers, the former Attorney General Dominic Grieve, they really do mean business. And while the government today has sought to say ministers are listening, government sources say they are looking to do what they can to make peace - as things stand tonight, it's feasible that the prime minister will be beaten in the Commons tomorrow night. Yes, a possible defeat on the eve of the European Council. The dispute (for once!) is pretty simple. A group of Tories, including former ministers and lawyers, are demanding a legal guarantee that MPs have a chance to vote on the terms of the final Brexit deal before we leave, what they say is a vital piece of democratic oversight. Yes, the government has already promised MPs a vote, but the rebels and the opposition parties want the promise to be enshrined in law as soon as possible. The government has already conceded the principle, they say, given that there is going to be another bill (yes another one) relating to the final deal. But for now, ministers, who are listening, and the government whips frantically trying to talk the rebels down, don't want to budge or give up their resistance to the proposed change. Meanwhile Labour is pushing the Tory rebels finally to walk the walk, not just talk the talk. The role of Labour's small band of Brexiteers will be vital too. There are suggestions that for a couple of them, the temptation to defeat the government could override their consistent positions of voting with the government on Brexit. And the sums are so finally balanced every vote will count. One of the leading rebels said ""it really may come down to the twos or threes"". A ministerial statement is expected in the morning that could contain more concessions to the rebels, or at least restate and package up the guarantees the government has already put forward. The situation could change rapidly, with another potential rebellion melting away. But the government may well have to budge, again, if they want to avoid defeat. It might have to be Theresa May and her ministerial team who blink this time.

"Ummarayiat Mirza pleaded guilty A married couple have been jailed for planning a terror attack in Birmingham. Ummarayiat Mirza, 21, and his wife Madihah Taheer, 22, were sentenced to 16 years and 10 years respectively. An intelligence operation had led to Mirza's arrest at gunpoint in March. Woolwich Crown Court head the couple, from Birmingham, had been planning a knife attack and had looked at targets, including the city's central synagogue. Mirza's sister, Zainub, was jailed for 30 months for sharing propaganda. Mirza was thought to have been planning a rampage for just days after the Westminster Bridge attack. The couple who put IS at heart of marriage His wife had brought him a large knife and the couple had fantasised about a life in the territories of the so-called Islamic State. He had pleaded guilty to preparing terrorist acts while Taheer was convicted of the same charge. Zainub Mirza admitted five counts of disseminating terrorist publications by sending her brother IS videos on social media. Passing sentence, Judge Christopher Kinch QC said Ummarayiat Mirza had made ""inexorable progress"" from enthusiasm for terrorism acts to training, sourcing of a weapon and researching a target. His 16-year term comes with an additional five years on licence, during which he could be returned to jail if he reoffends. Madihah Taheer has been sentenced to 10 years in prison. He described the case as a ""personal tragedy"" for Taheer as the trial began when her first child was only five months old but said she had been a willing partner at every stage of the plan.

"University leaders have been under pressure over high salaries University leaders have agreed to a new code on senior pay, which is expected to be published in the next few weeks. University representatives held a meeting with minister Jo Johnson on Wednesday where they accepted the need for more accountability. It follows fierce criticism of university leaders over claims of excessive senior pay, withthe head of the University of Bath stepping down. Mr Johnson says ""public confidence"" over pay had to be restored. The universities minister met leaders of Universities UK, the Russell Group and the Committee of University Chairs - with Mr Johnson calling for more restraint over pay. It is understood that a ""fair remuneration code"" will be published in January for university leaders, by the Committee of University Chairs. Mr Johnson told university leaders that there must be a more transparent and independent system for the setting of senior salaries - and an end to the ""upwards ratchet in pay"". He set out a series of requirements, including that vice chancellors must not sit on the committee that decides their pay. Jo Johnson has told universities they need to restore public confidence There will also have to be disclosure of benefits, such as subsidised housing and expenses. The size of pay gaps between university heads and academic staff will also have to be published. ""It is vital that pay arrangements command public confidence and deliver value for money for students and taxpayers,"" said Mr Johnson. Universities, under increasing public pressure and protests from their own academic staff, say they also want to ""rebuild public confidence"". ""We agree more needs to be done to ensure the process for deciding senior pay is viewed as open and accountable,"" a Russell Group spokesperson said. The group of leading universities says it is backing ""a new code to ensure pay-setting arrangements are as rigorous and transparent as they can be"". Universities UK said ""competitive pay is necessary to attract first rate leaders"" but a new code would be a ""welcome step"". ""As universities receive funding from taxpayers and through student fees, it is reasonable to expect pay decisions to be fair, accountable and justified,"" said a Universities UK spokesman. Mr Johnson last week warned the university sector that it needed to get pay under control - and that a new regulator would be used to enforce this. There have been a series of protests over vice-chancellors' pay in recent weeks - including at the University of Bath, the University of Southampton and at Bath Spa. ""Has there been a problem? Most definitely,"" said Mr Johnson last week. But he said universities now recognised the need to answer public concerns about value for money. ""I think they really are starting to get it.""

"Brexit ministers face questions from MPs It comes after government loses key Brexit vote last night MPs hear statement on forthcoming business Backbench business debates on hormone pregnancy tests and WASPI pensions Peers question government ministers on probation service Debates later on vulnerable children; and poverty Esther Webber and Richard Morris The UK and EU begin a new relationship on 1 January 2021. Theresa May, Jeremy Corbyn and Nicola Sturgeon opt for more traditional festive greetings. Labour's Keir Starmer has called the Brexit vote, in which the government was defeated over amendment 7 last night, a ""humiliating and entirely avoidable defeat"". The shadow Brexit secretary asked for a reassurance that the government will not seek to overturn the decision at report stage during Brexit questions in the Commons. David Davis said the effect of the vote was to see the powers available under section 9 deferred until after Royal Assent is given to the government's yet to be introduced Withdrawal and Implementation Bill. He said it would have the effect of compressing the timetable. The government wants to see a working statute book, as we leave the EU, he said, but as always we take the House of Commons view seriously. Keir Starmer called on the government to drop amendment 381 - this is the amendment which will put the date of exit on the bill. Rather than repeat last night's debacle, ""drop this gimmick"", he said. Hormone pregnancy tests debates House of CommonsParliament Chris Skidmore, Cabinet Office minister, says the issue was first raised in the House in 1978 when he was four years old. He says the government's priority is, and always will be, the safety of NHS patients. The government have ruled out no options, he says. The most recent publication is the most exhaustive examination of the issue to date, he adds. He apologises to the expert who contributed to the working group, previously mentioned by Sir Mike Penning, who feels that his contribution ""has been used inappropriately"". He finishes by saying ""nothing is off the table, and I am listening"". Sir Mike Penning wraps up the debate, saying ""there has to be an independent public inquiry, and if that inquiry decides it needs further evidence it needs to have the finance to do that"".   That's where we leave our coverage of the Commons and Lords for tonight. Thank you for joining us and we'll be back next week. Hormone pregnancy tests debate House of CommonsParliament Sharon Hodgson, shadow health minister, says ""the main sticking point"" of the review is that the working group did not find a causal link between the drug and problems. She says that evidence suggests that people need to be more ""critical"" of what was found by the working group. It can be argued that there were inconsistencies in the data used by the working group, she says. She says that in her research between two different drugs, the drug being debated today, Primodos, shows a much higher prevalence of problems. ""I'm no scientific professional, but the red flags that arise when reading what the evidence says and what the conclusions were drawn from them, are not ones that I believe only an expert in this field would see,"" she says. In closing, she says she hopes the debate takes them one step further. Hormone pregnancy tests debate House of CommonsParliament Hannah Bardell is summing up for the SNP. She says one of her constituents says that ""her life has been turned upside down"" and she shares more experiences she has heard of birth deformities and miscarriages. The drug was on the market ""unregulated, and untested, for five years"", she says. The SNP MP says that some visitors to the final press conference at the publication of the last report were locked out, herself and Yasmin Qureshi included. Allow Twitter content?

Hormone pregnancy tests debate House of CommonsParliament Liberal Democrat Sir Ed Davey tells the Commons of his constituent, whose daughter has struggled with poor health her whole life. He says the situation is ""a whole cover up, over a number of years""; and says he reads minutes and memos of meetings between company doctors and lawyers in Berlin. The minutes show that the lawyers and company knew of the problems with the drug, he says. ""He has to stand up to the official briefings he's getting,"" he tells the minister. Hormone pregnancy tests debate House of CommonsParliament Yasmin Qureshi with hormone pregnancy test campaigners Labour's Yasmin Qureshi, who has campaigned on this issue, says that a constituent contacting her about her poor health after her mother had taken the test during pregnancy. Ms Qureshi says that in her research, she uncovered research by a doctor that in cases where the mother had taken the test, ""there was a higher incidence of malformed babies, miscarriages, stillbirths and infant deaths"". His findings were so alarming that he wrote to the manufacturers, but she says it took another eight years before it was withdrawn from the market. She says she has raised the issue in the House many times with the current and previous prime ministers. During the inquiry established in 2014, witnesses and affected people ""were treated appallingly"", she says. She also tells the House an observer appointed to the inquiry was made to sign a gagging clause, meaning that she could not raise any concerns about the investigation. Hormone pregnancy tests debate House of CommonsParliament Conservative Sir Mike Penning is opening the second of today's backbench debates, this time on hormone pregnancy tests. He says that often these pills were taken in a GP's office, handed to them for free by drug companies. The tests became prevalent in the 1950s, 60s and 70s. He says the Royal College of GPs had informed the Department for Health in the 1960s that they were then concerned about the drugs. Sir Mike calls for an independent judge led inquiry to settle the matter. He says that a previous scientific review into the matter misrepresented one of the witness's opinions and contributions to the evidence. He says he wants to know why the drug company settled their lawsuit in America, and then ""gagged everything"". Pensions equality for women debate House of CommonsParliament Shadow work and pensions secretary Debbie Abrahams calls on the government to work with the affected women to come to a good solution. She says that life expectancy in people above 60 is decreasing. Work and Pensions Minister Guy Opperman says that improvements in life expectancy are to be welcomed, but it ""also brings enormous pressures"". In July, the government published its first review into the state pension age, and the government accepts the recommendations in the review which sees the pension age to be increased from 67 to 68 in 2039. Mr Opperman says that Ms Abrahams is ""scaremongering"" about life expectancy, and says that according to the Office for National Statistics, life expectancy is increasing. Pensions equality for women debate House of CommonsParliament The government are ""spinning in circles"", says the SNP's pensions spokesperson Mhairi Black. She says that it's still refusing to acknowledge the problems that women face. She criticises the fact that the onus is on women to contact the Department for Work and Pensions. ""We are trying to move society forward, and it's not going to get anywhere if the response is always, 'yeah, well we looked at that, it was rubbish, but let's move on',"" she says. She wants Parliamentarians to focus on how to fix the problem, rather than this ""blame game,"" she says. Pensions equality for women debate House of CommonsParliament The SNP's Patricia Gibson tells the Commons she has struggled to frame her debate in terms that haven't already been used. She says the life expectancy of women is not the issue today, she wants the minister to respond more on terms of how much notice was given to these women. She says the minister has said ""can we afford it,"" but she wants to say ""we cannot afford not to afford it,"" she adds. The social contract has been ""torn up"" by this government cruelly and callously, she says. BBC Scotland editor tweets Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Pensions equality for women debate House of CommonsParliament Liberal Democrat Stephen Lloyd tells the Commons that all political parties are culpable and ""have let women down"". ""From 1995 to 2009, there was no communication at all,"" he says, this was 14 years in which the DWP could have told women and they could have prepared, he adds. He says he believes the government should make available ""a flat sum of transition money"", and he makes a proposal, which he believes businesses would support, which is to delay the implementation of the corporation tax cut, which would raise the money to help WASPI women, he says. He calls for a ""proper vote"" for the Commons on the issue, to resolve it. Causes of poverty debate House of LordsParliament Crossbencher and Big Issue founder Lord Bird is opening a debate on the root causes of poverty. He says it's fitting that this is taking place six months after Grenfell, as we need to ""ensure the likes of Grenfell Tower never happen again"". He tells the House: ""People in social housing should not be living in the third world."" He observes that ""we like to hear stories about indomitable spirit of someone who does not accept poverty"", noting: ""My own family knew how to drink, smoke cigarettes and avoid paying the rent."" He says he's focused on ""calling the bluff on poverty"" as he believes there's a tendency towards ""emergency-ism, where we spend lots of money on the problem once it's happened"" and ""we need a revolution to shake it up"". He concludes: ""I don't read reports - I go into the street at 2am or 3am and talk to people,"" and he's convinced of the need to tackle ""the poverty of the responses to poverty"".

Background Reality Check During the election, politicians were keen to pledge support for women born in the 1950s who have been angered by rises in the age at which they qualify for a state pension. Millions of women have been caught up in government efforts to cut the mounting costs of paying for the state pension and to equalise the age at which men and women receive the state pension. That effort goes back decades, so here is a little history. Read more here. The Sun's Westminster correspondent tweets Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Pension equality for women debate House of CommonsParliament Conservative Anne-Marie Trevelyan tells the House that changes have been made ""without enough time to prepare"". She says many of the women affected have worked all their lives, and now circumstances mean that, with ill-health in particular, they are struggling to survive on what they have. These problems are exacerbated for people who live in rural areas, she adds. She says listening to all the stories from women has been ""beyond frustrating"", and the Department for Work and Pensions is ""unwilling to engage"" with the All-Party Parliamentary Group on WASPI women.

"Clockwise from top left: Ellis and Elliott Thornton-Kimmitt, Robbie Meerun, Anthony Armour and Darnell Harte A 15-year-old boy has admitted causing the deaths of five people who were killed when the stolen car they were in hit a tree in Leeds. Ellis, 12, and Elliott Thornton-Kimmitt, 14, died along with Darnell Harte, 15, Anthony Armour and Robbie Meerun, both 24, in the crash on 25 November. The boy, who cannot be named, appeared at Leeds Crown Court by video link. He pleaded guilty to five counts of causing death by dangerous driving. More on this story and others in West Yorkshire The three boys and two men died when the Renault Clio they were in crashed into a tree in Stonegate Road, Meanwood, at 21:55 GMT. The stolen car hit a tree on Stonegate Road in Meanwood West Yorkshire Police said the car had been stolen in the Headingley area of the city hours earlier. A force spokesman previously said officers found a scene of ""complete carnage"" when they arrived at the crash site on a residential street about three miles north of Leeds city centre. The boy was remanded in custody for reports to be prepared ahead of sentencing, which is expected to take place on 26 January. Floral tributes were placed close to the scene in the days after the crash Six people were in the car when it crashed on 25 November During the 20-minute hearing, several people in the public gallery wept as the guilty pleas were entered. Judge Peter Collier QC, the Recorder of Leeds, told the boy a custodial term was ""inevitable"" and he was warned to expect a lengthy sentence. Inquests into the deaths were opened and adjourned at Wakefield Coroner's Court on Monday. The Renault Clio struck a tree at speed, causing car parts to be strewn over the road and pavement Police closed the road for several hours to allow forensic investigations to be carried out David Holderness, from the Crown Prosecution Service, described the incident as a ""truly shocking crime"". He said: ""The defendant acted in a supremely dangerous way, driving erratically and at great speed in a residential area.

"Federal Reserve Chairman Janet Yellen has raised interest rates three times this year The US Federal Reserve has raised interest rates by 0.25%, the third rate rise in 2017. The US central bank said the move, which was widely expected, underscores ""solid"" gains in the US economy. Officials also boosted their economic forecasts, projecting 2.5% growth in GDP in 2017 and 2018, due in part to planned tax cuts. The Fed said it anticipates three further increases in rates next year, unchanged from its previous forecast. The decision to raise interest rates, raising the cost of borrowing, takes the Fed farther away from the ultra-low rates it put in place during the financial crisis to boost economic activity. The Fed is targeting a range of 1.25% to 1.5% for its benchmark rate. But a majority of officials said they expect interest rates above 2% will be appropriate next year. Republicans say tax deal agreed The perils of a political Federal Reserve Alabama election: Trump says Senate loss proves him right The shift in policy comes as the US economy gains strength. US economic output has increased at an annual rate of more than 3% in recent quarters, while the unemployment rate fell to 4.1% last month - the lowest rate since 2001. Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen, who is stepping down from her post in February, said the economy, labour market and financial system have grown stronger under her watch. ""There's less to lose sleep about now than has been true for quite some time, so I feel good about the economic outlook,"" she said. Ms Yellen said policymakers expect the economy to get a further lift from a package of tax cuts - one of President Trump's central campaign promises - and those expectations were factored in when they revised upwards their predictions for economic growth. The Fed is now forecasting 2.5% GDP growth in 2018, compared to a forecast it made in September of 2.1%. While Congress and President Trump's Administration continue to wrangle over tax reform, the Fed had to judge what the final outcome of that political process would mean for the economy.  Inevitably there is a lot of uncertainty in there but they have concluded that it would provide a boost over the next three years. The Fed's policy makers expect somewhat stronger growth than they did in September.  Janet Yellen said that reflected a view in the committee that the reforms would stimulate consumer spending and business investment. But there has not been much change in what the Fed's policy makers think of the longer term prospects.  The Fed publishes information showing the range of expectations that its policy makers have. The middle of that range for long term growth is unchanged at a rather modest 1.8%. Despite the acceleration in growth, members of the Federal Open Markets Committee said they expect interest rate increases to remain gradual - in part, a sign of ongoing concerns that inflation has remained below the Fed's 2% target. Ms Yellen said she continues to believe the lacklustre inflation growth is due to one-off factors, such as declines in costs for mobile phone plans. But she said the Fed will continue to watch those numbers and ""if necessary, re-think"" what is determining them. ""There's work undone there,"" she said.

"Theresa May has insisted Parliament will have a ""meaningful vote"" on the terms of Brexit as she faces the threat of a defeat in the Commons. The PM said MPs would have a say on the final deal before the UK exit in March 2019, but it must happen in a way that ensures a ""smooth and orderly"" exit. Tory rebels will join forces with Labour to seek an explicit legal guarantee in the EU Withdrawal Bill. Lead rebel Dominic Grieve said it was his time to ""stand up and be counted"". Parliament Live: MPs debate EU withdrawal bill What the EU Withdrawal Bill will do Kuenssberg: Who will blink first? Brexit Secretary David Davis has written to Tory MPs but Dominic Grieve - who is leading demands for a vote on any final Brexit deal before it is finalised - has said he will not back down. ""There is a time for everybody to stand up and be counted,"" the former attorney general told MPs. The day's debate on the EU bill is under way, with Mr Grieve's amendment due to be voted on later. The UK is due to leave the EU in March 2019, and negotiations are taking place on what their relationship will be in the future. The EU Withdrawal Bill is a key part of the government's exit strategy. Its effects include ending the supremacy of EU law and copying existing EU law into UK law, so that the same rules and regulations apply on Brexit day. The bill is currently making its way through Parliament, where MPs from across the House of Commons have been trying to amend it. So far it has emerged unscathed, but on Wednesday several rebels are lining up behind Mr Grieve's bid to ensure a ""meaningful vote"" on any final deal agreed with Brussels. This could be tricky for the government as it has no overall majority in the House of Commons. They want to change the EU Withdrawal Bill so the government is unable to implement the agreement it reaches with the EU unless MPs give the green light via a new Act of Parliament. They want to change a part of the bill that allows ministers to do this using secondary legislation, which has less scrutiny from MPs. Otherwise, they argue, Parliament might not get the final say on the terms of the UK's departure. The governmenthas already offereda take-it-or-leave-it vote on the final deal reached with Brussels and to enshrine the withdrawal agreement in a new Act of Parliament. But the rebels say that unless this is explicitly written into the bill, MPs and peers might get bypassed at the last minute. Ahead of the vote, Mr Davis wrote to all Conservative MPs on Wednesday morning promising ""a meaningful vote"" on Brexit. He said there will be a vote in Parliament ""as soon as possible"" after an agreement with the EU is reached, adding: ""Our entire approach to the bill has been to listen to MPs.""

Speaking during Prime Minister's Questions, Theresa May explained the government's objections to Mr Grieve's bid to require the Act of Parliament to be in force before ministers implement the deal. The new Act of Parliament might only be passed ""at a very late stage in the proceedings, which could mean that we are not able to have the orderly and smooth exit from the European Union that we wish to have"", she said. Both the UK and the EU currently say they want a deal by October 2018, to allow for the UK and European Parliaments to vote on it. We won't know until later, when Mr Grieve's amendment is debated. But he has claimed to have the numbers to inflict defeat on the government. Since the general election, where Theresa May lost the Tories' Commons majority, any vote has the potential to be close. The government needs the backing of Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party to get a working majority of 13, and several Conservative MPs have confirmed they will rebel. But will it be enough?

Labour has said it will support Mr Grieve's amendment, but what about its MPs that back Brexit - which way will they vote? One of the leading rebels told the BBC's Laura Kuenssberg ""it really may come down to the twos or threes"". By BBC assistant political editor Norman Smith I'm guessing everyone's a bit jaded with the endless Brexit rows and threats of revolts. But this one really does matter. This is the Big Bananas moment. And on that both sides seem to agree. It's not a minor, footling technical issue - it's about who's running the show, Parliament or the prime minister. Brexiteers view tonight's vote as an attempt by refusenik Remainers to de-rail Brexit. And, privately, some hard line Remainers see it as a means to fundamentally change the terms of the UK's departure from the EU.  Other rebels argue it's about making good the Brexiteers promise to ""take back control' to the UK Parliament. But it is also a Big Bananas moment for Theresa May. Defeat in the Commons - and it would be her first - would knock her premiership back on the ropes after she had bounced back with last week's deal in Brussels. It would also dent her authority in the Brexit negotiations with EU leaders, who would again question her ability to deliver a deal. May 'dancing to EU's tune' over Brexit - Farage Brexit talks are a furious race against time, says the EU Council Conservative MP Dominic Grieve (left) is leading the rebellion despite criticism from Eurosceptic MPs Man-of-the-moment Mr Grieve has set out his stall in the Commons, saying he cannot recall ever rebelling against his party before. However, he said: ""As Churchill said, 'he's a good party man - he puts the party before himself and the country before his party' and that's what I intend to do.""

Former Tory leader Iain Duncan Smith said: ""There comes a moment when really grandstanding has to stop. Tying the government's hands in the way that he would wish to tie them so early on is quite wrong."" Mr Grieve criticised the ""hurling of public abuse"" and pointed to Mr Duncan Smith's own rebellions over Europe. Former education secretary Nicky Morgan told the BBC it was in the national interest for Parliament to have a ""final vote on the final deal"" and urged ministers to listen at ""this late stage"". Other likely rebels have also indicated they will not be backing down, without further concessions by the government.

"Simon Bramhall was a liver, spleen and pancreas surgeon A surgeon who marked his initials on the livers of two transplant patients has admitted assault by beating. Simon Bramhall, 53, committed the offences at Birmingham's Queen Elizabeth Hospital in February and August 2013. The liver, spleen and pancreas surgeon was suspended later that year. He pleaded guilty to two charges at Birmingham Crown Court and will be sentenced at the same court on 12 January. He denied the more serious charge of assault occasioning actual bodily harm - a plea which was accepted by prosecutors. Tony Badenoch QC said the case was ""without legal precedent in criminal law"". Bramhall, who came to attention in 2010 when hetransplanted a liver saved from a burning aircraft into a patient, was suspended when the branding was discovered by another surgeon.

Simon Bramhall covered his face as he left Birmingham Crown Court Bramhall was suspended from Birmingham's Queen Elizabeth Hospital in 2013 It is not believed to have been harmful to the liver and the marks normally disappear. In one case it appears the organ was already damaged and as a result did not heal itself in the normal manner, allowing the marks to be seen. Mr Badenoch said it had been a ""highly unusual and complex case, both within the expert medical testimony served by both sides and in law."" He said what Bramhall had done was not isolated and required ""some skill and concentration"". ""It was done in the presence of colleagues,"" he said. His actions were carried out ""with a disregard for the feelings of unconscious patients"", the prosecutor added.

"Gary Haggarty was a police informer for 13 years The most senior loyalist ever to agree to become a so-called supergrass volunteered to kill a Catholic to cover up the fact he was an informer. Sean McParland died after being shot while babysitting in Belfast in 1994. The Ulster Volunteer Force was to decide the identity of the killer by flipping a coin, Belfast Crown Court heard. But Gary Haggarty volunteered to be the ""primary gunman"" because he feared he was suspected of being a police agent. Gary Haggarty: Full list of charges The intended target was a relative of Mr McParland, who was 55. Haggarty, an ex-commander of the UVF's north Belfast unit, was working as a paid Special Branch agent at the time of the killing. He worked as an informer for 13 years. In January 2010, he offered to become a supergrass - officially referred to as an assisting offender - and offered to give evidence against other UVF members he said were also involved in the crimes he committed. Haggarty, 45, a long-time police informer, has pleaded guilty to 202 terror offences, including five murders, as his part of a controversial state deal that offered a significantly reduced prison term in return for giving evidence against other terrorist suspects. The two-day sentencing hearing is expected to conclude on Thursday. Haggarty is likely to be given mandatory life sentences for each of the murders he has admitted. But he will also receive a significant reduction in his sentence in return for the amount of information he has provided as an assisting offender. Mr Justice Colton will make that decision based on the information put before him during the hearing. It is not clear when the sentence is likely to be imposed. Haggarty is to be the star prosecution witness in the trial of a man accused of murdering Catholic workmen Gary Convie and Eamon Fox in Belfast city centre in May 1994. But before he can give evidence he must first be sentenced for his own crimes. Gary Haggarty was the commander of the Ulster Volunteer Force's north Belfast unit That formal process began on Wednesday when a prosecution lawyer outlined some of the details of Haggarty's confessions to police. In one of the biggest and most complex cases undertaken in Northern Ireland, he was interviewed by detectives more than 1,000 times and the information he gave them ran beyond 12,000 pages. The extent of his criminal activities is staggering. As well as pleading guilty to 202 crimes, he asked that 301 others be taken into consideration. In total he admitted 503 offences, including: Five murders Five attempted murders 25 conspiracies to murder 66 charges of possession of firearms and ammunition Four counts of directing terrorism In addition to the killing of Sean McParland, he also admitted the murders of: John Harbinson, a Protestant handcuffed and beaten to death by a UVF gang on the Mount Vernon estate in north Belfast in May 1997 Catholic workmen Eamon Fox, 44 , a father of six, and Gary Convie, 24 , a father of one, shot dead as they had lunch together in a car in Belfast's North Queen Street in May 1994 Sean McDermott, a 37-year-old Catholic found shot dead in his car near Antrim in August 1994 Relatives of some of the victims were in court on Wednesday as a prosecution lawyer spent more than four hours outlining the extent of Haggarty's activities. He included harrowing details of some of the incidents. The judge was told how three of Sean McParland's young grandchildren ran screaming from his house in Skegoneill Avenue when the UVF burst in to kill him. Eamon Fox and Gary Convie were shot dead while eating their lunch at a building site in 1994 In police interviews, Haggarty said he shot the 55-year-old in the chest from close range. He had planned to fire another five bullets into his chest, but could not do so because his gun jammed. The prosecution lawyer said Haggarty, who was promoted within the UVF after the shooting, expressed regret during interviews after agreeing to become a supergrass. ""He said he is sorry, it was the wrong person killed, he is sorry for the kids that were there,"" said the lawyer. The court was also told that Haggarty acknowledged that two more of his victims, Eamon Fox and Gary Convie, were innocent men and not republicans as claimed by the UVF at the time. ""He said he did not believe they were republicans, but just soft easy targets,"" added the lawyer. Kieran Fox, one of Eamon Fox's six children, was one of the relatives in court as the details of Haggarty's litany of crimes was outlined, and welcomed the admission. ""To hear that Haggarty has admitted before they actually carried out the shooting that my dad and Gary were both innocent, that they were not republicans as they claimed at the time, it was nice to hear that part,"" he said. The court also heard harrowing details about the extent of injuries to John Harbinson. The dead man's son was also in the public gallery but left shortly after details of the injuries were described. Haggarty was involved in abducting Mr Harbinson, but told police he thought he was going to be beaten and shot in the legs, rather than killed. The hearing will continue on Thursday, when a lawyer representing Gary Haggarty will outline details he gave his police handlers during 13 years as an informer. He is said to have provided information on: 55 murders 20 attempted murders 56 conspiracies to murder 24 bombing offences Prosecutors have said Haggarty's evidence is insufficient to provide a reasonable prospect of obtaining a conviction against 11 other suspected UVF members and two former police intelligence officers, allegedly his then handlers. The police bristle at the very mention of the word supergrass, because of its association with a series of high-profile trials in the 1980s. Hundreds of republicans and loyalists were convicted on the word of informers and suspects who agreed to give evidence in return for reduced sentences, new identities and lives outside Northern Ireland. Those deals were done at a political level, with the details kept secret.

"Ms Dugdale made no comment to journalists when she returned to the Scottish Parliament on Wednesday afternoon Scottish Labour has given its former leader a written warning over her controversial appearance on I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here!. But the party said Kezia Dugdale would face no further disciplinary action after her stint on the reality TV show. Ms Dugdale flew into Glasgow Airport from Australia just before midday. She then met party bosses, including her successor Richard Leonard, and was formally reprimanded over her ""unauthorised absence"". Ms Dugdale later arrived at Holyrood in time for a vote at 17:00, and made no comment to waiting journalists when she left the chamber a short time later. A statement subsequently released by Scottish Labour said Ms Dugdale had been interviewed by its parliamentary group executive. Ms Dugdale insisted she had used her time in the jungle to promote Labour values The statement added: ""Following a discussion between Richard Leonard, Kezia Dugdale, and the group executive, it has been decided that the group will reprimand Ms Dugdale by way of written warning. She will not face further action."" It quoted Ms Dugdale as saying that she had ""deep regret"" that her appearance on the reality show had ""caused issues in the first weeks of Richard Leonard's leadership"", and that she was now ""getting back to work"". Ms Dugdale, who faced criticism over her three-week absence from the Scottish Parliament while appearing on the show, had earlier said it was ""good to be back"" in Scotland as she arrived at the airport, The MSP was the second contestant to be voted off the ITV show, which was won by Made in Chelsea star Georgia Toffolo. She spent a week in Australia after being evicted from the jungle - and has pledged to donate a percentage of her appearance fee to charity, but has not said exactly how much. She took her seat in the Holyrood chamber in time for a vote at the end of the day's business Voting statisticsreleased by the programme,externalshowed that Ms Dugdale won just 1.67% of the votes on the day she was evicted. As she arrived in Glasgow, Ms Dugdale said the experience was one she was never going to forget. The politician, who remained in Australia until after the programme's final on Sunday, had said she wanted to use her appearance to reach out to young people about political values. Asked if she felt she had in fact promoted Labour values she replied: ""I did so in the jungle and will continue to do so."" Ms Dugdale arrived back in Glasgow earlier on Wednesday after three weeks in Australia Ms Dugdale, who was not suspended despite fierce criticism from some within Scottish Labour, has acknowledged she has ""a bit of work to do to make amends"". She previously told the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme it was difficult to seek approval for her appearance on the show during the leadership contest between Richard Leonard and Anas Sarwar. The election, triggered by her resignation in August, was won by Mr Leonard - who immediately expressed his disappointment at Ms Dugdale's decision, which was made public just hours before the leadership result was announced. Mr Leonard said at the time that the party would consider suspending Ms Dugdale - but UK Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said hedid not believe suspension would be appropriate. After being voted out on the jungle, Ms Dugdale said: ""I do understand that it's controversial, I do understand there are lots of people at home that are unhappy that I've taken part in this programme and I've got a bit of work to do to make amends. ""But please don't doubt the fact that I'm devoted to the Labour Party, I love my job and I think I'm better-placed to do it for a long time now having had this experience.""

"Facebook says its investigation into Russian attempts to influence the Brexit vote has determined the activity amounted to just three adverts. Twitter says its own inquiry has linked six ads promoting referendum-related content on its platform to Russian sources. The Electoral Commission had asked the social media giants for the data. But an MP who had also demanded the review has said he is dissatisfied with Facebook's response. Facebook said it had looked into activity by accounts and pages it had previously tied to a Russian organisation called the Internet Research Agency. It said the Brexit ads had cost less than $1 (75p) in total to post, and had reached no more than 200 UK-based viewers over four days. The Kremlin has previously denied trying to meddle in the referendum. An earlier investigation into Russian meddling during the 2016 US presidential election found more than $100,000 had been spent on 3,000 Facebook adverts, placed by the   Internet Research Agency. In January, the US Director of National Intelligence identified the same agency as a vehicle for spreading misinformation. In a letter to the Electoral Commission, Facebook said: ""We strongly support the commission's efforts to regulate and enforce political campaign finance rules in the United Kingdom, and we take the commission's request very seriously."" But Damian Collins, MP and chair of the digital, culture and media select committee was not impressed. ""Facebook responded only with regards to funded advertisements to audiences in the UK from the around 470 accounts and pages run by the Russian based Internet Research Agency, which had been active during the US Presidential election. ""It would appear that no work has been done by Facebook to look for Russian activity around the EU referendum, other than from funded advertisements from those accounts that had already been identified as part of the US Senate's investigation. ""No work has been done by Facebook to look for other fake accounts and pages that could be linked to Russian-backed agencies and which were active during the EU referendum, as I requested."" Twitter later issued its own response to the Electoral Commission. ""Among the accounts that we have previously identified as likely funded from Russian sources, we have thus far identified one account - @RT_com - which promoted referendum-related content during the regulated period,"" it said. The account in question is run by the state-funded broadcaster RT, formerly known as Russia Today. Twitter added that a total of $1,031.99 had been spent on six referendum-related ads during the campaign. In a speech in November, the prime minister accused Russia of spreading fake news, meddling in elections and mounting a sustained campaign of cyber-espionage. Theresa May made no specific mention of any meddling in the EU referendum, but there has been mounting pressure from politicians for an investigation into any attempts to interfere in the vote. A study by academics in the UK and USsuggested that tens of thousands of Russia-based Twitter accounts, many of them apparently automated, had posted tweets about the EU vote during the campaign.

"John Cleese and Eric Idle re-create a Monty Python sketch about boasting about a tough childhood Ofsted chief Amanda Spielman has warned that underperforming schools can get caught in a culture of ""disadvantage one-upmanship"", where schools focus too much on their pupils' deprivation. She likened it to a Monty Python comedy sketch where people compete with claims to have had the toughest childhood. Ms Spielman was presenting her annual report, which highlighted a small core of persistently underachieving schools. But she said disadvantage was not an excuse for low achievement. The Ofsted chief suggested schools seemed sometimes to be competing over how many pupils were on free school meals or how many did not speak English as a first language. ""I think people become absorbed by this narrative,"" said Ms Spielman at the launch of the annual report from England's education watchdog. ""They've got big and daunting challenges, but we want to encourage people to look past them. We want them to focus on what can be done."" She likened it to theFour Yorkshiremen comedy sketch performed by Monty Python, where characters make increasingly exaggerated claims about hardship when they were growing up. The annual report says 90% of primary schools are now good or outstanding The report highlighted schools from this year's round of inspections which had repeatedly failed to improve, with around 80 primary and 50 secondary schools below the level of ""good"" in inspections since 2005. There are also about about 500 primary and 200 secondary schools which have been rated as requiring improvement on their previous two inspections. These struggling schools were most likely to be in disadvantaged areas with a high proportion of poor white pupils, to have a high turnover of staff, and heads and teachers facing ""burnout"". But Ms Spielman said that there were thousands of other schools facing similar challenges which were performing much better. The annual report shows that overall 90% of all primary schools and 79% of secondary schools are rated good or outstanding. Although outstanding schools are no longer routinely inspected - and almost one in 10 have not been inspected in the past 10 years. But the Ofsted chief said against a positive backdrop it would still be wrong to ""turn a blind eye"" to weaknesses. She warned of an ongoing problem with unregistered religious schools which were operating illegally and which could be teaching extremist views and seeking to ""isolate young people from the mainstream"". Ofsted chief Amanda Spielman warns of struggling schools where teachers 'burn out' Ofsted has warned for several years of children beingtaught in squalid conditions with inadequate lessons. Ms Spielman called for stronger rights for inspectors to intervene and seize evidence, such as books or documentation. She warned of such schools promoting sexist or homophobic views. Ms Spielman's report also raised particular concerns about education standards in young offenders institutions, which she said could be ""extremely poor"". ""Without access to a proper, decent learning and training we are passing de facto life sentences on young offenders,"" she said. Responding to concerns about schools which seemed to have ""intractable"" difficulties in improving, heads' leader Geoff Barton said Ofsted could be part of the problem. When schools were ""stigmatised"" by bad Ofsted reports, recruiting staff and pupils became more difficult and schools could be ""trapped in cycles of underperformance"", said Mr Barton, leader of the ASCL head teachers' union. He said the problem was exacerbated by a ""teacher recruitment and retention crisis"" and the ""underfunding of schools"". Paul Whiteman, leader of the National Association of Head Teachers, said the high performance of so many schools was ""all the more remarkable against the backdrop of austerity and all the added pressures that brings"". Angela Rayner, Labour's shadow education secretary, said: ""The fact that under the Tories schools have consistently struggled to improve, have struggled to recruit staff and had high levels of turnover should come as a wake-up call."" A Department for Education spokeswoman said: ""We are targeting the areas that need the most support through our opportunity areas. ""And by investing Â£280m over the next two years to target resources at the schools most in need to improve school performance and deliver more good school places.""

"Facebook says its investigation into Russian attempts to influence the Brexit vote has determined the activity amounted to just three adverts. Twitter says its own inquiry has linked six ads promoting referendum-related content on its platform to Russian sources. The Electoral Commission had asked the social media giants for the data. But an MP who had also demanded the review has said he is dissatisfied with Facebook's response. Facebook said it had looked into activity by accounts and pages it had previously tied to a Russian organisation called the Internet Research Agency. It said the Brexit ads had cost less than $1 (75p) in total to post, and had reached no more than 200 UK-based viewers over four days. The Kremlin has previously denied trying to meddle in the referendum. An earlier investigation into Russian meddling during the 2016 US presidential election found more than $100,000 had been spent on 3,000 Facebook adverts, placed by the   Internet Research Agency. In January, the US Director of National Intelligence identified the same agency as a vehicle for spreading misinformation. In a letter to the Electoral Commission, Facebook said: ""We strongly support the commission's efforts to regulate and enforce political campaign finance rules in the United Kingdom, and we take the commission's request very seriously."" But Damian Collins, MP and chair of the digital, culture and media select committee was not impressed. ""Facebook responded only with regards to funded advertisements to audiences in the UK from the around 470 accounts and pages run by the Russian based Internet Research Agency, which had been active during the US Presidential election. ""It would appear that no work has been done by Facebook to look for Russian activity around the EU referendum, other than from funded advertisements from those accounts that had already been identified as part of the US Senate's investigation. ""No work has been done by Facebook to look for other fake accounts and pages that could be linked to Russian-backed agencies and which were active during the EU referendum, as I requested."" Twitter later issued its own response to the Electoral Commission. ""Among the accounts that we have previously identified as likely funded from Russian sources, we have thus far identified one account - @RT_com - which promoted referendum-related content during the regulated period,"" it said. The account in question is run by the state-funded broadcaster RT, formerly known as Russia Today. Twitter added that a total of $1,031.99 had been spent on six referendum-related ads during the campaign. In a speech in November, the prime minister accused Russia of spreading fake news, meddling in elections and mounting a sustained campaign of cyber-espionage. Theresa May made no specific mention of any meddling in the EU referendum, but there has been mounting pressure from politicians for an investigation into any attempts to interfere in the vote. A study by academics in the UK and USsuggested that tens of thousands of Russia-based Twitter accounts, many of them apparently automated, had posted tweets about the EU vote during the campaign.

"Ummarayiat Mirza pleaded guilty A married couple have been jailed for planning a terror attack in Birmingham. Ummarayiat Mirza, 21, and his wife Madihah Taheer, 22, were sentenced to 16 years and 10 years respectively. An intelligence operation had led to Mirza's arrest at gunpoint in March. Woolwich Crown Court head the couple, from Birmingham, had been planning a knife attack and had looked at targets, including the city's central synagogue. Mirza's sister, Zainub, was jailed for 30 months for sharing propaganda. Mirza was thought to have been planning a rampage for just days after the Westminster Bridge attack. The couple who put IS at heart of marriage His wife had brought him a large knife and the couple had fantasised about a life in the territories of the so-called Islamic State. He had pleaded guilty to preparing terrorist acts while Taheer was convicted of the same charge. Zainub Mirza admitted five counts of disseminating terrorist publications by sending her brother IS videos on social media. Passing sentence, Judge Christopher Kinch QC said Ummarayiat Mirza had made ""inexorable progress"" from enthusiasm for terrorism acts to training, sourcing of a weapon and researching a target. His 16-year term comes with an additional five years on licence, during which he could be returned to jail if he reoffends. Madihah Taheer has been sentenced to 10 years in prison. He described the case as a ""personal tragedy"" for Taheer as the trial began when her first child was only five months old but said she had been a willing partner at every stage of the plan.

"Pro-Palestinian protesters gathered outside the OIC summit venue in Istanbul The leaders of 57 Muslim nations have called on the world to recognise ""the State of Palestine and East Jerusalem as its occupied capital"". An Organisation of Islamic Co-operation communique declares US President Donald Trump's decision to recognise the city as Israel's capital as ""null and void"". It also says the move has signalled Washington's withdrawal from its role in the Middle East peace process. Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas earlier said the UN should take over. In a speech to the OIC summit in Istanbul, Mr Abbas said it would be ""unacceptable"" for the US to be the mediator ""since it is biased in favour of Israel"". The Palestinians had engaged with the Trump administration in an attempt to agree ""the deal of the century"", he noted, but had instead ""got the slap of the century"". The status of Jerusalem goes to the heart of Israel's conflict with the Palestinians. The city is home to key religious sites sacred to Judaism, Islam and Christianity, especially in East Jerusalem. This video can not be played Why the ancient city of Jerusalem is so important Israel occupied the sector, previously occupied by Jordan, in the 1967 Middle East war and regards the entire city as its indivisible capital. The Palestinians claim East Jerusalem as the capital of a future state, and its final status is meant to be discussed in the latter stages of peace talks. Israeli sovereignty over Jerusalem has never been recognised internationally, and all countries currently maintain their embassies in Tel Aviv. However, President Trump has announced that the US will eventually move its embassy. Trump Jerusalem shift puts counter-terror efforts at risk Anger in Ramallah and delight in West Jerusalem The communique issued by OIC member states says they reject the unilateral decision by the US,externalto recognise Jerusalem as Israel's capital as ""null and void legally"" and consider it an ""attack"" on the rights of the Palestinian people. They accuse the US of ""deliberately undermining"" peace efforts and warn that it has given ""impetus to extremism and terrorism"". They say Washington will be held ""fully liable for all the consequences of not retracting from this illegal decision"" and that it has effectively announced its ""withdrawal from its role as sponsor"" of the Israeli-Palestinian peace process. They then invite all countries to ""recognise the State of Palestine and East Jerusalem as its occupied capital"" and ask the UN to assume its responsibilities and reaffirm the city's legal position. The BBC's Mark Lowen in Istanbul says that after street protests and widespread condemnation of Mr Trump's declaration, this was an attempt by Muslim leaders to harden their response. The meeting was convened by Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, a strident critic of the US move, who vowed to ""stand up to American bullying"" and called Israel ""a state of terror"". Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan vowed to ""stand up to American bullying"" But, our correspondent says, some Muslim leaders are more pro-Trump than others; Saudi Arabia and Egypt only sent ministers to this meeting, possibly to keep the US on board. So, he adds, there was a semblance of unity at the OIC summit and tough talk, but little sign that Donald Trump was listening. The view from one street Where countries stand on Jerusalem move The White House said Mr Abbas's comments were of the kind of rhetoric that ""has prevented peace for years"". An unnamed official said: ""We anticipated reactions like this. We will remain hard at work putting together our plan, which will benefit the Israeli and Palestinian peoples."" Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he was ""not impressed"" by the OIC's statement. ""The Palestinians would do better by recognising reality and acting in favour of peace and not extremism,"" he said. ""In the end the truth will win out and many countries will recognise Jerusalem as Israel's capital and move their embassies there."" He previously said there was ""no substitute"" for the US' role in the peace process.

"Theresa May has insisted Parliament will have a ""meaningful vote"" on the terms of Brexit as she faces the threat of a defeat in the Commons. The PM said MPs would have a say on the final deal before the UK exit in March 2019, but it must happen in a way that ensures a ""smooth and orderly"" exit. Tory rebels will join forces with Labour to seek an explicit legal guarantee in the EU Withdrawal Bill. Lead rebel Dominic Grieve said it was his time to ""stand up and be counted"". Parliament Live: MPs debate EU withdrawal bill What the EU Withdrawal Bill will do Kuenssberg: Who will blink first? Brexit Secretary David Davis has written to Tory MPs but Dominic Grieve - who is leading demands for a vote on any final Brexit deal before it is finalised - has said he will not back down. ""There is a time for everybody to stand up and be counted,"" the former attorney general told MPs. The day's debate on the EU bill is under way, with Mr Grieve's amendment due to be voted on later. The UK is due to leave the EU in March 2019, and negotiations are taking place on what their relationship will be in the future. The EU Withdrawal Bill is a key part of the government's exit strategy. Its effects include ending the supremacy of EU law and copying existing EU law into UK law, so that the same rules and regulations apply on Brexit day. The bill is currently making its way through Parliament, where MPs from across the House of Commons have been trying to amend it. So far it has emerged unscathed, but on Wednesday several rebels are lining up behind Mr Grieve's bid to ensure a ""meaningful vote"" on any final deal agreed with Brussels. This could be tricky for the government as it has no overall majority in the House of Commons. They want to change the EU Withdrawal Bill so the government is unable to implement the agreement it reaches with the EU unless MPs give the green light via a new Act of Parliament. They want to change a part of the bill that allows ministers to do this using secondary legislation, which has less scrutiny from MPs. Otherwise, they argue, Parliament might not get the final say on the terms of the UK's departure. The governmenthas already offereda take-it-or-leave-it vote on the final deal reached with Brussels and to enshrine the withdrawal agreement in a new Act of Parliament. But the rebels say that unless this is explicitly written into the bill, MPs and peers might get bypassed at the last minute. Ahead of the vote, Mr Davis wrote to all Conservative MPs on Wednesday morning promising ""a meaningful vote"" on Brexit. He said there will be a vote in Parliament ""as soon as possible"" after an agreement with the EU is reached, adding: ""Our entire approach to the bill has been to listen to MPs.""

Speaking during Prime Minister's Questions, Theresa May explained the government's objections to Mr Grieve's bid to require the Act of Parliament to be in force before ministers implement the deal. The new Act of Parliament might only be passed ""at a very late stage in the proceedings, which could mean that we are not able to have the orderly and smooth exit from the European Union that we wish to have"", she said. Both the UK and the EU currently say they want a deal by October 2018, to allow for the UK and European Parliaments to vote on it. We won't know until later, when Mr Grieve's amendment is debated. But he has claimed to have the numbers to inflict defeat on the government. Since the general election, where Theresa May lost the Tories' Commons majority, any vote has the potential to be close. The government needs the backing of Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party to get a working majority of 13, and several Conservative MPs have confirmed they will rebel. But will it be enough?

Labour has said it will support Mr Grieve's amendment, but what about its MPs that back Brexit - which way will they vote? One of the leading rebels told the BBC's Laura Kuenssberg ""it really may come down to the twos or threes"". By BBC assistant political editor Norman Smith I'm guessing everyone's a bit jaded with the endless Brexit rows and threats of revolts. But this one really does matter. This is the Big Bananas moment. And on that both sides seem to agree. It's not a minor, footling technical issue - it's about who's running the show, Parliament or the prime minister. Brexiteers view tonight's vote as an attempt by refusenik Remainers to de-rail Brexit. And, privately, some hard line Remainers see it as a means to fundamentally change the terms of the UK's departure from the EU.  Other rebels argue it's about making good the Brexiteers promise to ""take back control' to the UK Parliament. But it is also a Big Bananas moment for Theresa May. Defeat in the Commons - and it would be her first - would knock her premiership back on the ropes after she had bounced back with last week's deal in Brussels. It would also dent her authority in the Brexit negotiations with EU leaders, who would again question her ability to deliver a deal. May 'dancing to EU's tune' over Brexit - Farage Brexit talks are a furious race against time, says the EU Council Conservative MP Dominic Grieve (left) is leading the rebellion despite criticism from Eurosceptic MPs Man-of-the-moment Mr Grieve has set out his stall in the Commons, saying he cannot recall ever rebelling against his party before. However, he said: ""As Churchill said, 'he's a good party man - he puts the party before himself and the country before his party' and that's what I intend to do."" Mr Grieve and the other likely Tory rebels have faced criticism from some of their colleagues. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Former Tory leader Iain Duncan Smith said: ""There comes a moment when really grandstanding has to stop. Tying the government's hands in the way that he would wish to tie them so early on is quite wrong."" Mr Grieve criticised the ""hurling of public abuse"" and pointed to Mr Duncan Smith's own rebellions over Europe. Former education secretary Nicky Morgan told the BBC it was in the national interest for Parliament to have a ""final vote on the final deal"" and urged ministers to listen at ""this late stage"". Other likely rebels have also indicated they will not be backing down, without further concessions by the government.

"This video can not be played What the Alabama upset will mean for Donald Trump's agenda Christmas has come early for Democrats, who notched a surprise win in Alabama in one of the most unpredictable, improbable Senate races in modern memory. But what kind of mark will this vote leave on US politics? The last time Alabama elected a Democratic US senator was 25 years ago. Since then the state has been moving steadily to the right - in 2016, Donald Trump defeated Hillary Clinton there by nearly 30 points. There are few, if any, US states as ruby-red conservative. And yet a plurality of voters have sent Democrat Doug Jones to the US Senate. There is a risk in reading too much into these results in Alabama, given the unique circumstances. The Republican candidate had a cloud of controversy hanging over his head - not just from allegations of sexual impropriety, but also a history of inflammatory statements and legal run-ins that knocked him out of the Alabama Supreme Court twice. The former judge had a loyal base of support, but there were traditionally Republican voters who found his views on homosexuality, Muslims and civil rights distasteful. Despite his obvious flaws as a candidate with any broad appeal, the impact of this defeat will be felt in several ways. Prior to election day, Alabama officials estimated that about 20% of Alabama registered voters would show up to vote in this special election. The latest figures put that number closer to 40%. Roughly 1.3 million ballots were cast in the state, and in county after county Democrats exceeded expectations, particularly compared to turnout from Republicans in their party's rural and suburban strongholds. It's a trend that echoes the results in Virginia - the other big electoral test of 2017. In November, Democratic voter participation in that more narrowly-divided state surged, carrying the party's candidate for governor to an easy victory and nearly winning enough seats to take control of the state legislature. Progressives have touted their ""resistance"" to the Trump presidency, and it appears that - at least so far - their enthusiasm is translating into numbers at the ballot box. That will bode well for the party's prospects in the big congressional mid-term elections that loom on the horizon in November 2018. Among Democratic voters, African-Americans went to the voting booths in particularly strong numbers and voted overwhelmingly for Mr Jones. According to exit polls, they accounted for nearly 30% of Tuesday's electorate, while only making up 26% of the state's total population. In 2016 lower black turnout proved costly for Mrs Clinton in states like Michigan, Wisconsin and Florida. In Alabama they were the Democratic lifeline. Who is Alabama Democrat Doug Jones? Things Republican Roy Moore believes Doug Jones supporters were ecstatic Roy Moore was supposed to be Steve Bannon's first big victory, a cannonball fired into the heart of the Republican establishment and a visible example of the populist-evangelical electoral alliance he was crafting. Instead, the former Trump campaign head and senior White House adviser has been humbled. His candidate, it turns out, was deeply flawed and he ended up losing what should have been a slam-dunk Senate election. Mr Bannon has declared all-out war against Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, whom he views as insufficiently supportive of Mr Trump's ""America first"" agenda, and promised to field 2018 primary challengers against every Republican senator running for re-election save Texan Ted Cruz. If Mr Moore had prevailed, Mr Bannon would probably have found plenty of volunteers ready to lead the charge and deep-pocketed benefactors to finance the efforts. Now, however, instead of claiming his first scalp, he will be blamed by leaders in his party for narrowing the Republican Senate majority and damaging the party's brand. Bannon stuck with Moore when other Republicans deserted him On Tuesday night, a magnanimous president took to Twitter to congratulate Mr Jones on his Senate victory. This probably won't be the president's last word on the matter but for now, his reaction could reflect an acknowledgment that despite his support for Mr Moore, it wasn't enough to pull his man over the finish line, even in conservative Alabama. Other top officials in the Republican Party were reluctant to back Mr Moore, particularly after the Washington Post allegations of sexual misconduct were revealed, but Mr Trump steadily ramped up his backing for the beleaguered candidate. If the president or his aides take a closer look at the state's exit polls, there is certainly cause for concern, as 41% of Alabama voters ""strongly disapproved"" of the president, while only 32% ""strongly approved"". While Mr Trump may dismiss opinion surveys that show his approval ratings in the mid-30s nationally, the Alabama results are actual voters casting actual ballots. Elections don't lie, and the election results have a serious message for the president less than a year into his term. The Republican majority in the Senate narrows to 51-49, and the party can only afford to lose a single vote on any measure, thanks to Vice-President Mike Pence's power to break a tie. Mr Jones probably won't be seated until early January, which means the Republicans still have time to pass their tax-cut bill and vote on any year-end budgetary resolutions, but after that the window for legislative success narrows considerably. More than that, it also puts control of the Senate squarely in play in the 2018 mid-term congressional elections. Democrats have to defend a number of at-risk seats - in Trump-leaning states like Missouri, Indiana, West Virginia and North Dakota - but if their incumbents manage to hold on, there are two clear pick-up opportunities in Nevada and Arizona. If they had lost the Alabama race, the next tier of states - Tennessee and Texas - were much bigger reaches. Of course, Alabama has shown that, given the right confluence of candidates and controversy, anything is possible. In the past week, three members of the US Congress - two Democrats and one Republican - have announced their resignations because of reports of sexual impropriety. While their actions hinted that there would be a political price in the new environment of sexual-harassment sensitivity, the true test would come at the ballot box. Mr Moore faced accusations - which he denied - of improper relations with teenage girls when he was an assistant district attorney in his 30s. It appeared possible that Alabama voters would elect him to the Senate anyway, with Mr Moore's supporters arguing that their man had been vindicated or, perhaps, absolved by the voters. It's a line of defence not too different from the one being constructed by the White House, as allegations made by more than a dozen women President Donald Trump have received renewed consideration. This video can not be played Jessica Leeds is calling on Congress to open an inquiry into President Trump ""The people of this country, at a decisive election, supported President Trump, and we feel like these allegations have been answered through that process,"" White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said on Monday. In Alabama, however, Mr Moore won't have a chance to make that argument. It's not clear how much the allegations played a part in his defeat but politicians across the US will surely be taking note.

"This video can not be played What the Alabama upset will mean for Donald Trump's agenda Doug Jones has become the first Democrat in 25 years to win a US Senate seat for Alabama, after a bitter campaign against Republican Roy Moore. His unexpected victory deals a blow to President Donald Trump, who backed Mr Moore, and narrows the Republican majority in the Senate to 51-49. Mr Moore has so far refused to concede, saying ""it's not over"". He fought a controversial campaign, in which allegations surfaced of sexual misconduct with teenage girls. Mr Moore, a firebrand conservative who has said he believes that homosexual activity should be illegal, has repeatedly denied the claims against him. The contest was for the seat vacated by US Attorney General Jeff Sessions earlier this year. Donald Trump tumbles to earth with a bump Defeat prompts Republican rethink USA Today savages Trump over Gillibrand comments Anthony Zurcher, BBC News, Washington Alabama will have a Democrat in the US Senate. It's an outcome that seemed all but impossible a year ago and still seemed unlikely even as voters headed to the polls on Tuesday. Supporters of Doug Jones celebrate at the election night party in Birmingham, Alabama The ramifications of this unexpected victory are clear. The Republican majority in the Senate will narrow, considerably improving the chances Democrats could gain control of the chamber in the 2018 mid-term elections. It could also be seen as a rebuke of President Donald Trump, who gave full-throated support to Roy Moore even when other leaders in his party were hesitant. After winning governor races in Virginia and New Jersey in November, some Democratic supporters will be hoping that an anti-Trump electoral wave is forming. But Moore was such a flawed candidate that it may be too early to tell. Read more from Anthony Mr Jones won with 49.9% of the vote, to Mr Moore's 48.4%. All votes from precincts around the state have been counted. The margin of victory is well above the half a percentage point which would have triggered a recount. This video can not be played Roy Moore: ""It is not over"" But Alabama Secretary of State John Merrill, quoted by the Washington Post, said a recount could still be ordered if a review of write-in votes and overseas ballots narrowed it to within this range. Overseas ballots can continue to come in until the seventh day after the election, ie 19 December, the Department of Defense's Federal Voting Assistance Program says.,external There was a total of 1.7% of votes for write-ins, where voters wrote in names of candidates who did not appear on the ballot paper. Even if the final result is outside the 0.5% margin, either candidate can request a recount if they are prepared to pay the costs, Alabama officials say. Mr Moore, a 70-year-old former judge, told his supporters it was not yet over. ""We've been painted in an unfavourable and unfaithful light,"" he said. ""Realise that when the vote is this close that it's not over."" Although Mr Moore did not concede, President Trump congratulated Mr Jones in a tweet shortly after US media declared him the winner, adding that ""Republicans will have another shot at this seat in a very short period of time"". The Senate seat will come up for re-election in November 2020. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Later,the president tweeted that he had endorsed Mr Moore's opponent in the Republican primary, Luther Strange, because he thought the former judge ""could not win a general election"",external, adding that ""the deck was stacked against him"". Mr Jones told his supporters in a victory speech that the ""entire race has been about dignity and respect"". ""This campaign has been about the rule of law. This campaign has been about common courtesy and decency and making sure everyone in this state, regardless of which zip code you live in, is going to get a fair shake in life,"" he said before the crowd erupted in cheers. This video can not be played Doug Jones: ""We have shown America the way"" The 63-year-old is a former lawyer known for helping convict two Ku Klux Klan members who bombed a black church in 1963 in Birmingham, killing four girls. He has never held elected office. Who is Alabama Democrat Doug Jones? The former judge has made headlines for a series of incendiary remarks over the years, including his belief that Muslims are not fit to serve in Congress. Things Republican Roy Moore believes But it was allegations of sexual misconduct made by several women, some when they were teenagers, that dogged Mr Moore's campaign and drew national attention to the special election. One accuser alleges Mr Moore molested her when she was 14 while another claims he sexually assaulted her in a car while she was a teenager. The claims against Mr Moore came amid a wave of allegations of sexual misconduct against prominent figures that has led to the resignation of three politicians. The election will reduce the Republican majority in the Senate to 51-49. However, Luther Strange - the Republican appointed to replace Mr Sessions as an interim senator in February - is likely to remain in the seat until early January. This means the party will still have time to pass its tax-cut bill and vote on any year-end budgetary resolutions, but after that the window for legislative success narrows considerably, says the BBC's Anthony Zurcher. After Mr Jones takes his seat, the Republicans can only afford to lose one vote - in the event of a 50-50 split Vice-President Mike Pence will have the casting vote.

"British armed forces veterans could have their driving licences stamped with a ""V"", as part of plans to improve the recognition of their service. The move, similar to a US scheme, could see 2.5 million ex-military personnel issued with the new licence to ""clearly distinguish"" them as veterans. The card would give holders easier access to specialist services and to offers, including retail discounts. PM Theresa May said veterans deserved ""recognition for their sacrifice"". The scheme, to be announced by the prime minister later, could be implemented in the early 2020s. Mrs May will say the card will be the first universally recognised ID for veterans in the UK and will create a new proof of service for veterans. The Ministry of Defence is working with the Department for Transport and the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA) to adapt the design of the current driving licence. Allow Twitter content?

"Wage growth fell behind inflation for a seventh month in a row, according to new employment figures. The Office for National Statistics said average weekly wages rose by 2.3% in the three months to October, below inflation at 3%. Real earnings, which take into account the cost of living, fell by 0.4% Unemployment declined by 26,000 to 1.43 million, while the jobless rate remained at 4.3%, the lowest since 1975. However, while unemployment fell, the decline was not as steep as the 59,000 drop recorded in the three months to September. The pressure on household finances is likely to worsen as the most recent figures for inflation showed a rise to 3.1% in November - the highest in nearly six years. John Hawksworth, chief economist at PwC, said: ""Real pay levels continue to be squeezed, and we expect this to persist for at least the first half of 2018, further dampening consumer spending growth."" Average weekly pay, excluding bonuses, reached Â£478 which is the lowest since February 2006. However, average weekly wages were ahead of the 2.2% rise in the three months to September. Ben Brettell, senior economist at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: ""The pay squeeze continues for now, but with wages growing a little more strongly and inflation set to fall back in the new year, this looks like it'll come to an end in the next few months.""

The number of people claiming benefits principally for the reason of being unemployed rose by 5,900 to 817,500 in November. Economists had expected the number of claimants, which is considered to be a potential early warning sign of an economic downturn, to rise by 3,200, according to Reuters news agency. The number of people in employment also dropped, down by 56,000 to 32 million, with men the biggest casualties of the decline. The level of employment fell by 50,000 for men and by 6,000 for women. The biggest fall was for men aged 18-24 years old. What is striking about these figures is that the number of people employed is shrinking. In the three months from August to October, there were 32 million people working: still a lot and more than a year ago. But it's 56,000 fewer than the previous three months. For most of the last six years - and indeed most of the last 30 - the workforce has been expanding. And it's happening in spite of 798,000 job vacancies. So we have a labour market that's tighter than ever - yet a workforce that's shrinking. How can that be happening? Well one possible answer you may already have guessed. It has a lot to do with the slowdown in immigration. And it rhymes with ""exit"". Howard Archer, chief economic adviser at the EY ITEM Club, said: ""The latest data suggest that UK labour market strength is currently being diluted by extended lacklustre UK economic activity, as well as heightened business uncertainties and concerns over the economic and political outlook including Brexit. ""There are also reports that employment growth in some sectors is being limited by a lack of suitable candidates."" However, he said that employment was ""still at a very high level"", with the rate at 75.1%. UK inflation rate at near six-year high Why is Christmas dinner more expensive this year?

"John Cleese and Eric Idle re-create a Monty Python sketch about boasting about a tough childhood Ofsted chief Amanda Spielman has warned that underperforming schools can get caught in a culture of ""disadvantage one-upmanship"", where schools focus too much on their pupils' deprivation. She likened it to a Monty Python comedy sketch where people compete with claims to have had the toughest childhood. Ms Spielman was presenting her annual report, which highlighted a small core of persistently underachieving schools. But she said disadvantage was not an excuse for low achievement. The Ofsted chief suggested schools seemed sometimes to be competing over how many pupils were on free school meals or how many did not speak English as a first language. ""I think people become absorbed by this narrative,"" said Ms Spielman at the launch of the annual report from England's education watchdog. ""They've got big and daunting challenges, but we want to encourage people to look past them. We want them to focus on what can be done."" She likened it to theFour Yorkshiremen comedy sketch performed by Monty Python, where characters make increasingly exaggerated claims about hardship when they were growing up. The annual report says 90% of primary schools are now good or outstanding The report highlighted schools from this year's round of inspections which had repeatedly failed to improve, with around 80 primary and 50 secondary schools below the level of ""good"" in inspections since 2005. There are also about about 500 primary and 200 secondary schools which have been rated as requiring improvement on their previous two inspections. These struggling schools were most likely to be in disadvantaged areas with a high proportion of poor white pupils, to have a high turnover of staff, and heads and teachers facing ""burnout"". But Ms Spielman said that there were thousands of other schools facing similar challenges which were performing much better. The annual report shows that overall 90% of all primary schools and 79% of secondary schools are rated good or outstanding. Although outstanding schools are no longer routinely inspected - and almost one in 10 have not been inspected in the past 10 years. But the Ofsted chief said against a positive backdrop it would still be wrong to ""turn a blind eye"" to weaknesses. She warned of an ongoing problem with unregistered religious schools which were operating illegally and which could be teaching extremist views and seeking to ""isolate young people from the mainstream"". Ofsted chief Amanda Spielman warns of struggling schools where teachers 'burn out' Ofsted has warned for several years of children beingtaught in squalid conditions with inadequate lessons. Ms Spielman called for stronger rights for inspectors to intervene and seize evidence, such as books or documentation. She warned of such schools promoting sexist or homophobic views. Ms Spielman's report also raised particular concerns about education standards in young offenders institutions, which she said could be ""extremely poor"". ""Without access to a proper, decent learning and training we are passing de facto life sentences on young offenders,"" she said. Responding to concerns about schools which seemed to have ""intractable"" difficulties in improving, heads' leader Geoff Barton said Ofsted could be part of the problem. When schools were ""stigmatised"" by bad Ofsted reports, recruiting staff and pupils became more difficult and schools could be ""trapped in cycles of underperformance"", said Mr Barton, leader of the ASCL head teachers' union. He said the problem was exacerbated by a ""teacher recruitment and retention crisis"" and the ""underfunding of schools"". Paul Whiteman, leader of the National Association of Head Teachers, said the high performance of so many schools was ""all the more remarkable against the backdrop of austerity and all the added pressures that brings"". Angela Rayner, Labour's shadow education secretary, said: ""The fact that under the Tories schools have consistently struggled to improve, have struggled to recruit staff and had high levels of turnover should come as a wake-up call."" A Department for Education spokeswoman said: ""We are targeting the areas that need the most support through our opportunity areas. ""And by investing Â£280m over the next two years to target resources at the schools most in need to improve school performance and deliver more good school places.""

"Samuel Armstrong has claimed what happened took place with ""full consent"" A woman who claims she was raped by an MP's chief of staff in Westminster gave the story to journalists hours after the alleged attack, a jury has heard. Samuel Armstrong, of Danbury, Essex, denies two charges of rape and two of sexual assault on 14 October 2016. Southwark Crown Court heard the woman sent a message to her boyfriend. ""Keeping you in the loop. I've given it to Harry Cole who works for the Sun. It will either be in the Mail on Sunday or the Sun front page on Monday,"" it said. Jurors were told the message was sent 15 hours after the alleged assault, and a later message said: ""The media already knew so this is my way of controlling it to ensure I get a sympathetic writer."" When Sarah Forshaw QC, defending, asked the woman, a parliamentary worker in her 20s, about the messages, she insisted she did not sell the story and explained it had been a friend who spoke to the Sun. She said: ""I really didn't want my identity to come out and it was a state where I had absolutely no control in the event, so I wanted a little bit of control."" The court has heard claims the attack happened in the early hours in the Westminster office of South Thanet MP Craig Mackinlay after the woman fell asleep there after a night drinking. The woman said Mr Armstrong, 24, of Copt Hill, called her a ""bitch"" and raped her twice after she turned down an invitation to go back to his flat in Clapham, south London. It is claimed the attack happened in the Westminster office of South Thanet MP Craig Mackinlay Ms Forshaw suggested the woman became distressed when she tried to leave Westminster after having consensual sex with Mr Armstrong. ""When it was over you were not upset with him at all, were you?"" she asked. But the woman answered: ""Yes - I was completely confused and devastated in the truest sense of that word."" The woman admitted sending a request to Mr Armstrong to follow him on Twitter in September 2017 but said it was an accident. Ms Forshaw suggested to the victim she had told a lie at the time, but once she had told it she couldn't take it back, and the woman told her she was ""incorrect"". The defence lawyer also put it to her that everything that happened in Mr Mackinlay's office was with her consent, but the woman answered: ""No, absolutely not."" Mr Armstrong's defence lawyer suggested the woman became distressed as she left The court has heard the pair were at the sports and social bar on the evening of 13 October, before they went to the roof garden terrace to see Big Ben. Jurors heard they later went to the leader's terrace in the Lords' office to drink wine, before taking a bottle back to Mr Mackinlay's office in the Norman Shaw building. The court heard suggestions the pair mutually kissed as they danced to jazz music in the office, before they had consensual sex - a claim the woman denied. She also denied a suggestion she had swept papers on to the floor so they could continue on a desk. Ms Forshaw said to the woman: ""Far from being unhappy during this sexual encounter, you and he were chatting during sex?"" The defence barrister asked the woman if she remembered Mr Armstrong saying something like ""how does the size suit the lady?"" - but the alleged victim replied ""no"". Ms Forshaw added: ""You said that it suited you well. Do you remember that?"" The woman again replied: ""No."" Jurors heard from cleaner Vincent Ble who said the woman was ""shaking and crying"" when he saw her. He said she held on to him while his manager called the police. And the jury heard the phone call made on the parliamentary network in which the sobbing woman told an officer she was ""forced upon"", before she added: ""I got taken back, I don't know.... and I've just had sex and I really, really didn't want to.""

"This video can not be played My close escape from Â£10,000 bank scam Seventy-two-year-old Barry Fox is one of hundreds of people saved from scams after bank staff stopped him spending Â£10,000 on a fictitious Rolls-Royce. The retired lorry driver went into his Barclays branch intending to withdraw the cash to pay for the luxury car he saw on an internet auction site. Staff were concerned and used a new system to alert police to the case and, within 30 minutes, officers were there. They made checks and alerted Mr Fox to the fact he was about to be scammed. This was one of 1,262 calls made by bank staff to police or trading standards under the Banking Protocol system that should see an officer arrive to offer help within an hour. UK Finance, which represents the major banks, said this had saved potential victims a combined total of Â£9.1m in its first year of operation. Individuals had been saved between Â£99 and Â£212,000 each. Mr Fox had received some inheritance and decided to spend it on his dream car. The seller told him that they would pick him up from a railway station and then travel to a countryside location to pick up the car. He would pay Â£10,000 in cash. Bank staff said it ""didn't seem right"". The police officers alerted him to the fact that the car was registered hundreds of miles away. The details of the seller on eBay did not match the business which had the car, so there was no realistic possibility of buying it. ""I might have gone there with Â£10,000 in my pocket and been knocked over the head with a stick or something,"" said Mr Fox. 'I risk death threats to expose scammers' Queensland police python photo gains internet fame 'Meghan Markle' and 'fidget spinners' top UK Google search Mr Fox was simply advised not to take out the money in this case. Eventually he bought another Rolls-Royce being sold legitimately. In other cases in the last 12 months, 101 arrests have been made after calls were made by concerned bank staff. The system has been introduced gradually across the country since May and nearly all UK police forces are now signed up. Katy Worobec, from UK Finance, said: ""The finance industry is determined to crack down on fraud and is taking action on all fronts. The protocol is an important weapon in our armoury."" Other cases of fraud prevention by banks include: A man who was conned into thinking he was being contacted via Facebook by a long-lost girlfriend, who then asked him to turn up at the airport with a parcel of cash to help deal with formalities A woman who was rung by a scammer who claimed her computer had all sorts of problems. He persuaded her to give him online access to her computer and installed malware. Then he made a big apology and promised compensation. He sent too much money and demanded the difference back in cash, but the original payment would have never gone through A man came into the branch asking for thousands of pounds in cash, intending to bury it in the garden so he could get to it quickly when needed. Police explained to him that he could be robbed if information about the stash leaked out and that the banknotes could be ruined One consumer group said the system should be extended to other types of scam. Alex Neill, of Which?, said this was a small part of a wider problem. ""In the first six months of 2017, more than Â£100m was lost to bank transfer scams,"" she said. She urged banks to introduce ""similarly robust measures"" to deal with online scams ""where consumers remain vulnerable"".

"This video can not be played Police have released footage of the gang caught in the act. The ringleader of a gang who smuggled drugs and phones into prisons using drones has been jailed for seven years and two months. Former armed robber Craig Hickinbottom, 35, organised the flights from behind bars, Birmingham Crown Court was told. His gang put prohibited items worth an estimated Â£1m into jails as far apart as the West Midlands and Scotland. The packages were attached to fishing lines and flown over prison walls. Nine others were also sentenced. The group were convicted of organising 49 drone flights, although police believe the actual number may be higher. They were also found guilty of four ""throw-overs"" - with one of the gang, Craig Hickinbottom's brother spotted on CCTV with an improvised hook, ready to collect the goods from inside prison. The gang were caught by chance, by cameras set up to film wildlife outside HMP Hewell in Worcestershire. Footage shows two of the men in a field, preparing a drone for flight, before sending it over the hedge to the prison grounds. Inside, the packages - some of which were specifically ordered -  were retrieved by inmates. Prison CCTV showed others visiting their cells and walking out with packages. As well as drugs and phones, the gang smuggled in weapons, screwdrivers, sim cards, and a Freeview box with remote control. Craig Hickinbottom's brother John, was seen with an extendable hook, ready to collect the goods Drone pilot Mervyn Foster, 36, of Tipton, West Midlands, was jailed for six years and eight months for his part in the plot. He was said to be the gang's prime organiser on the outside. Hickinbotton was serving a sentence at HMP Featherstone in Staffordshire, and later Hewell, while organising the deliveries. UK drone users to sit safety tests Undercover filming reveals prison chaos The flying drones that can scan packages night and day Drone near-miss 'put 130 lives at risk' The offences, which were committed between July 2015 and May this year, also took place at jails in Birmingham, Yorkshire, Cheshire, Liverpool, and Perth. Both Hickinbottom and Foster pleaded guilty to conspiring to bring prohibited items into prison, and conspiracy to supply psychoactive substances. Craig Hickinbottom's 50-year-old brother, John, was jailed for four years and eight month, while his ""right-hand man"" John Quinn, 35, was sentenced to four years and eight months. They admitted the same charges, as well as conspiring to throw an article into prison. His 32-year-old partner, Lisa Hodgetts, from Tividale, West Midlands, admitted money laundering and was given a 16-month suspended prison term. Passing sentence, Judge Roderick Henderson said: ""Prisons are difficult enough places to run - they contain people who are dangerous and vulnerable. ""Supplying things into prison that should not be there - drugs, phones, tools and the like - threatens proper management... and creates real risks of violence and loss of control and discipline"". Gareth Sands, governor at HMP Hewell, said the drones were a ""gamechanger"" that ""literally came from nowhere"". The gang were able to breach the perimeters ""almost effortlessly"", he said, adding that procedures had been tightened up in the wake of the case. Four other men were sentenced after pleading guilty: Francis Ward, 46, of Walsall, was jailed for two years and four months for conspiring to bring prohibited items into prison, and conspiracy to supply psychoactive substances Sanjay Patel, 38, of Telford, was jailed for five years and three months for possessing an electronic communication device whilst in custody Ashley Rollinson, 23, of Brierley Hill, West Midlands, was jailed for 11 months for conspiring to bring prohibited articles into prison Terry Leach, 19, of Tipton, West Midlands, was given a two year suspended prison sentence for conspiring to bring prohibited articles into prison. Yvonne Hay, 41, of Walsall, was jailed for two years and four months after being convicted of conspiring to bring prohibited items into prison, and conspiracy to supply psychoactive substances.

"Mr Trump had urged supporters to vote for Mr Moore For Roy Moore it looks like the next time he saddles up his horse it will be to ride off into the sunset. The maverick Christian conservative who enjoyed the full-throated support of Steve Bannon, the slightly-more-tempered endorsement of Donald Trump and the outright antipathy of certain sections of the GOP, has failed in the reddest of red states. So how much should be read into this defeat? Needless to say - and understandably - most of the attention will fall on the humiliation this represents to Donald Trump, but the bigger loser is his erstwhile White House head of strategy Steve Bannon. Alabama was to be the Petri dish for next November's mid-term elections. Alabama would show that rabble-rousing, right-wing, anti-establishment, swamp-draining insurgents could take on the Republican Party grandees in primary races and then cruise to victory afterwards in the main election against the Democrats. Roy Moore's (R) defeat is a blow to Steve Bannon (L) and his insurgent campaign Well Mr Bannon got one out of two. Yes, Roy Moore beat Luther Strange to win the Republican nomination - but he lost where it mattered. And that is calamitous for Mr Bannon. Roy Moore defeat in Alabama: Five consequences Who is Alabama Senate victor Doug Jones? Things Republican Roy Moore believes This is a result where you can be sure the Republican establishment will be savouring a Bannon defeat almost as much as the Democrats are rubbing their eyes in wonderment at their victory. Mr Bannon, the self-declared Leninist wanting to rip down the walls of the establishment, looks a weaker man today. Not finished by any means, but certainly undermined. This video can not be played What the Alabama upset will mean for Donald Trump's agenda Donald Trump, aside from finding himself on the losing side - which his opponents will revel in - will now find getting legislation through the Senate much more difficult. There will now be 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats. It means the awkward squad in the GOP now have much more leverage over legislation. Senators Flake and Corker, who are standing down and loathe Donald Trump, will need to be courted rather than abused by the president. Those of a more liberal bent might seek to rein in the president's more far-reaching proposals. Mr Trump's gut instinct got him the Republican nomination against all the odds and won him the presidential election. But on Alabama he's now found himself on the losing side - twice. First backing Luther Strange and then, after he lost, getting behind - and more importantly sticking with - Roy Moore even when it became clear he was a political liability after repeated allegations of sexual abuse against teenage girls emerged. Why this matters is that for two years now Donald Trump seems to have defied the laws of political gravity. Say what you like, insult who you like, do what you like, and when Newton's Law is suspended no harm will come to you. But suddenly this president is no longer operating in a weightless environment. He has tumbled to earth with a bump. This is important. When someone seems invincible but turns out to be mortal after all, it will affect how your friends and enemies approach you. They might become less fearful. The Democrats still have plenty of problems that need addressing Now let's say a word about the real winners in all this, the Democrats. After a dreadful 18 months they have a victory to crow about. They have won in Alabama. Alabama, for goodness sake. Surely this is the platform for sweeping the board at the mid-terms! Taking back control of Congress. A hammer blow to the Trump presidency. All I would say to that is - steady. This was not a decisive vote for Democratic Party politics, this was a referendum on Roy Moore. And given the accusations against him, and given the number of prominent people who came out to say they had no reason to disbelieve his female accusers (the president's daughter, Ivanka, the Senate majority leader, the House Speaker to name but three), Mr Moore ran Doug Jones incredibly close. And what is it the Democrats stand for? Are they the party of Hillary Clinton or Bernie Sanders? What is their distinct economic message? How do they win back the blue collar workers (and a lot of other groups besides who went over to Donald Trump in 2016)? The Democrats are right to bask in their success today. Why wouldn't you? But the problems that led them to lose in November 2016 have not gone away with their astonishing victory in Alabama. Democrat wins in Alabama Senate upset What the Alabama upset means for Trump.

"Wage growth fell behind inflation for a seventh month in a row, according to new employment figures. The Office for National Statistics said average weekly wages rose by 2.3% in the three months to October, below inflation at 3%. Real earnings, which take into account the cost of living, fell by 0.4% Unemployment declined by 26,000 to 1.43 million, while the jobless rate remained at 4.3%, the lowest since 1975. However, while unemployment fell, the decline was not as steep as the 59,000 drop recorded in the three months to September. The pressure on household finances is likely to worsen as the most recent figures for inflation showed a rise to 3.1% in November - the highest in nearly six years. John Hawksworth, chief economist at PwC, said: ""Real pay levels continue to be squeezed, and we expect this to persist for at least the first half of 2018, further dampening consumer spending growth."" Average weekly pay, excluding bonuses, reached Â£478 which is the lowest since February 2006. However, average weekly wages were ahead of the 2.2% rise in the three months to September. Ben Brettell, senior economist at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: ""The pay squeeze continues for now, but with wages growing a little more strongly and inflation set to fall back in the new year, this looks like it'll come to an end in the next few months.""

The number of people claiming benefits principally for the reason of being unemployed rose by 5,900 to 817,500 in November. Economists had expected the number of claimants, which is considered to be a potential early warning sign of an economic downturn, to rise by 3,200, according to Reuters news agency. The number of people in employment also dropped, down by 56,000 to 32 million, with men the biggest casualties of the decline. The level of employment fell by 50,000 for men and by 6,000 for women. The biggest fall was for men aged 18-24 years old. What is striking about these figures is that the number of people employed is shrinking. In the three months from August to October, there were 32 million people working: still a lot and more than a year ago. But it's 56,000 fewer than the previous three months. For most of the last six years - and indeed most of the last 30 - the workforce has been expanding. And it's happening in spite of 798,000 job vacancies. So we have a labour market that's tighter than ever - yet a workforce that's shrinking. How can that be happening? Well one possible answer you may already have guessed. It has a lot to do with the slowdown in immigration. And it rhymes with ""exit"". Howard Archer, chief economic adviser at the EY ITEM Club, said: ""The latest data suggest that UK labour market strength is currently being diluted by extended lacklustre UK economic activity, as well as heightened business uncertainties and concerns over the economic and political outlook including Brexit. ""There are also reports that employment growth in some sectors is being limited by a lack of suitable candidates."" However, he said that employment was ""still at a very high level"", with the rate at 75.1%. UK inflation rate at near six-year high Why is Christmas dinner more expensive this year?

"Four lectures by the deceased cleric Anwar al-Awlaki were among the material found Lectures by a radical Islamist cleric linked to the 9/11 attacks and other jihadist content have been discovered on LinkedIn. The business-focused social network was alerted to the issue after an investigation by the Tony Blair Institute for Global Change. The Microsoft-owned business has since removed the material. But it faces criticism for not having taken a more proactive stance ahead of the discovery. According to the former prime minister's research body - whose remit includes counter-extremism - some of the documents had been on LinkedIn for eight years. The researcher who made the discovery, earlier this month, said there had been no obvious way to flag the problem to the technology company, and ultimatelyrelied on the Times newspaper,externalto bring it to Microsoft's attention. ""Platforms must ensure that sufficient, effective reporting mechanisms are in place,"" Mubaraz Ahmed told the BBC. ""The likes of Facebook, Twitter, and Google have taken demonstrable and effective steps to counter terrorists' use of the internet, but other platforms must not ignore the risks or become complacent."" A total of 18 jihadist documents uploaded between 2009 and 2016 were discovered by Mr Ahmed on LinkedIn's Slideshare service. Slideshare allows LinkedIn members to show each other documents and presentations Before they were removed, they had collectively attracted more than 21,000 views. They included: a lecture arguing democracy is in contradiction to Islam a call for Muslims to commit violence and seek martyrdom a demand Muslims help finance jihadist activities an order for retaliation against cartoons depicting the Prophet Muhammad advice that children do not need their parents' permission to engage in jihadist activities The authors included Anwar al-Awlaki, a radical American cleric who met two of the 11 September 2001hijackers before their attack, as well as being linked to other plots before his death in 2011.

"Household water bills in England and Wales will fall by between Â£15 and Â£25 a year from 2020 to 2025, the regulator Ofwat has pledged. A forthcoming price review will give water companies less wiggle room to recover the costs of debt and equity from customers, the regulator said. Ofwat wascriticised by an influential government committeein 2016 for overestimating water firms' costs. Water UK, said it was a ""tough challenge from Ofwat"". Consumers can look forward to a real terms fall in water bills, Ofwat said. Since privatisation in 1989, water bills have risen above inflation by about 40%, leading to a debate about whether privatisation works for that industry. The regulator's chief executive, Cathryn Ross, told the BBC: ""We have an early view on the financing costs that we're going to enable companies to recover from their customers. ""That's the biggest single driver of the bill. Financing costs are about a third of the average bill."" She said those financing costs for water companies had come down from 3.74% in 2014 to 2.4% now, and that difference can be passed on to customers. But companies are allowed to add the cost of inflation on to bills. So from 2020, customers will be paying less than they would have been paying had the price controls not been set at that level by Ofwat, but there may not be an actual, noticeable fall in the bill. Michael Roberts, Chief Executive of Water UK, said Ofwat's review would be ""tougher for some companies than others"". However, he added: "" The industry has a strong track record in providing customers with a world class product and service. ""We've cut bills, increased help for the less well-off, and reduced leakage by a third, and we are committed to achieving even more for customers in the future."" The final Ofwat price review will be published in 2019. Analysis: BBC Today programme business presenter Dominic O'Connell Jeremy Corbyn has a simple remedy for the perceived excessive profits and underperformance of water companies - nationalisation. Ofwat's answer is not so easily digestible - 260 pages of dense regulatorese, full of catchy concepts like the ""weighted average cost of capital for appointee companies"". The headline savings promised, just Â£15 to Â£25 a year from an average bill in the five years from 2020, will also not set many hearts racing. Ofwat's problem is that the companies it regulates have by and large prospered despite its successive attempts to crack down on returns. Severn Trent, the largest quoted water company - one that has shares listed on the stock exchange - has promised its shareholders dividends of inflation plus 4% for the foreseeable future, an astonishing return for what is a low-risk utility stock. Ofwat needs to find a much sharper tool if its solution, rather than Mr Corbyn's, is to catch the public imagination. Ms Ross said nationalisation would be a political decision, but that since privatisation, water firms had invested Â£140bn. ""There has to be a question about whether government would do that if that were to land on the public balance sheet, but of course, government can borrow more cheaply,"" she said. In a price review, Ofwat looks at the costs of financing that water firms face; the costs of service, such as how much it costs to transport water or treat it; and it looks at how water firms can improve their service. In 2016, the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) said Ofwat had consistently overestimated water companies' costs. Ms Ross said the regulator had taken a view in 2009 of what the financing costs would be, and ""actually the financing costs were a lot lower than that, and that's really why the MPs were criticising us"". ""We've taken that on board, and that's why today... we're taking a tougher line,"" she added. The Consumer Council for Water, a watchdog, said an Ofwat decision to get rid of a cap on rewards for beating performance targets ""could open the door to bill instability"" after 2019. Tony Smith, the watchdog's chief executive, said: ""This could hand companies an opportunity to claw back some of the money they would be unable to get through lower financing costs and it could lead to bill increases which many customers view as rewards for doing the day job.""

"British armed forces veterans could have their driving licences stamped with a ""V"", as part of plans to improve the recognition of their service. The move, similar to a US scheme, could see 2.5 million ex-military personnel issued with the new licence to ""clearly distinguish"" them as veterans. The card would give holders easier access to specialist services and to offers, including retail discounts. PM Theresa May said veterans deserved ""recognition for their sacrifice"". The scheme, to be announced by the prime minister later, could be implemented in the early 2020s. Mrs May will say the card will be the first universally recognised ID for veterans in the UK and will create a new proof of service for veterans. The Ministry of Defence is working with the Department for Transport and the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA) to adapt the design of the current driving licence. Allow Twitter content?

The idea came from Veterans Minister Tobias Ellwood, who said it would improve the recognition of veterans. The Conservative MP for Bournemouth East said: ""As a former soldier, I am aware of the personal attachment with the service ID. ""Carried at all times it becomes symbolic of the responsibility and there is a strange sense of loss when upon departing the armed forces, it is taken from you. ""I'm delighted this initiative, which sits in the Armed Forces Covenant, will help us all better recognise our veterans and their service to our country."" Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson said he hoped the card would become ""a badge of honour"" for veterans. ""I hope this ID will become a badge of honour for the veteran community,"" he added. The proposed scheme is similar to one in the US, where ex-service personnel receive a veterans' card containing their names, photo and details of medals. The card is also used to access some healthcare benefits.

"This video can not be played My close escape from Â£10,000 bank scam Seventy-two-year-old Barry Fox is one of hundreds of people saved from scams after bank staff stopped him spending Â£10,000 on a fictitious Rolls-Royce. The retired lorry driver went into his Barclays branch intending to withdraw the cash to pay for the luxury car he saw on an internet auction site. Staff were concerned and used a new system to alert police to the case and, within 30 minutes, officers were there. They made checks and alerted Mr Fox to the fact he was about to be scammed. This was one of 1,262 calls made by bank staff to police or trading standards under the Banking Protocol system that should see an officer arrive to offer help within an hour. UK Finance, which represents the major banks, said this had saved potential victims a combined total of Â£9.1m in its first year of operation. Individuals had been saved between Â£99 and Â£212,000 each. Mr Fox had received some inheritance and decided to spend it on his dream car. The seller told him that they would pick him up from a railway station and then travel to a countryside location to pick up the car. He would pay Â£10,000 in cash. Bank staff said it ""didn't seem right"". The police officers alerted him to the fact that the car was registered hundreds of miles away. The details of the seller on eBay did not match the business which had the car, so there was no realistic possibility of buying it. ""I might have gone there with Â£10,000 in my pocket and been knocked over the head with a stick or something,"" said Mr Fox. 'I risk death threats to expose scammers' Queensland police python photo gains internet fame 'Meghan Markle' and 'fidget spinners' top UK Google search Mr Fox was simply advised not to take out the money in this case. Eventually he bought another Rolls-Royce being sold legitimately. In other cases in the last 12 months, 101 arrests have been made after calls were made by concerned bank staff. The system has been introduced gradually across the country since May and nearly all UK police forces are now signed up. Katy Worobec, from UK Finance, said: ""The finance industry is determined to crack down on fraud and is taking action on all fronts. The protocol is an important weapon in our armoury."" Other cases of fraud prevention by banks include: A man who was conned into thinking he was being contacted via Facebook by a long-lost girlfriend, who then asked him to turn up at the airport with a parcel of cash to help deal with formalities A woman who was rung by a scammer who claimed her computer had all sorts of problems. He persuaded her to give him online access to her computer and installed malware. Then he made a big apology and promised compensation. He sent too much money and demanded the difference back in cash, but the original payment would have never gone through A man came into the branch asking for thousands of pounds in cash, intending to bury it in the garden so he could get to it quickly when needed. Police explained to him that he could be robbed if information about the stash leaked out and that the banknotes could be ruined One consumer group said the system should be extended to other types of scam. Alex Neill, of Which?, said this was a small part of a wider problem. ""In the first six months of 2017, more than Â£100m was lost to bank transfer scams,"" she said. She urged banks to introduce ""similarly robust measures"" to deal with online scams ""where consumers remain vulnerable"".

"Three children aged 14, eight and seven, died in the blaze Two people charged with murder over the deaths of three children in a house fire in Salford have appeared in court. Zak Bolland, 23, and Courtney Brierley, 20, both of Worsley, Salford were also charged with arson and four counts of attempted murder. They were remanded in custody until their next appearance. Demi Pearson, 14, Brandon, eight, and Lacie, seven, died in the blaze on Monday. Their mother Michelle and a three-year-old remain in hospital. Mr Bolland, of Blackleach Drive, and Ms Brierley, of Worsley Avenue, did not apply for bail and are listed to appear at Manchester Crown Court on Thursday. Two men, aged 19 and 20, arrested on suspicion of murder have been released on police bail. A 24-year-old man arrested on suspicion of assisting an offender has also been bailed. Brandon and Lacie died in hospital The three-year-old, who cannot be named due to their age, is in a critical condition in hospital following the fire at a property in Walkden, which broke out at about 05:00 GMT. Ms Pearson, 35, has been heavily sedated and has not yet been told about the deaths of her children. Two 16-year-olds - who also can not be named for legal reasons - in the house at the time of the blaze managed to escape. Greater Manchester Police confirmed there had been incidents at the family's home prior to the blaze and it had referred the case to the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC). The head teacher at the school Demi attended said she was a ""really good kid"" Drew Povey, head teacher at Harrop Fold School, Worsley, which Demi attended, paid tribute to the popular pupil. He said she was a ""really good kidâ¦ fun-lovingâ¦ and funny"". ""Inside school [her] friendship group was enormous.

"Wage growth fell behind inflation for a seventh month in a row, according to new employment figures. The Office for National Statistics said average weekly wages rose by 2.3% in the three months to October, below inflation at 3%. Real earnings, which take into account the cost of living, fell by 0.4% Unemployment declined by 26,000 to 1.43 million, while the jobless rate remained at 4.3%, the lowest since 1975. However, while unemployment fell, the decline was not as steep as the 59,000 drop recorded in the three months to September. The pressure on household finances is likely to worsen as the most recent figures for inflation showed a rise to 3.1% in November - the highest in nearly six years. John Hawksworth, chief economist at PwC, said: ""Real pay levels continue to be squeezed, and we expect this to persist for at least the first half of 2018, further dampening consumer spending growth."" Average weekly pay, excluding bonuses, reached Â£478 which is the lowest since February 2006. However, average weekly wages were ahead of the 2.2% rise in the three months to September. Ben Brettell, senior economist at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: ""The pay squeeze continues for now, but with wages growing a little more strongly and inflation set to fall back in the new year, this looks like it'll come to an end in the next few months.""

The number of people claiming benefits principally for the reason of being unemployed rose by 5,900 to 817,500 in November. Economists had expected the number of claimants, which is considered to be a potential early warning sign of an economic downturn, to rise by 3,200, according to Reuters news agency. The number of people in employment also dropped, down by 56,000 to 32 million, with men the biggest casualties of the decline. The level of employment fell by 50,000 for men and by 6,000 for women. The biggest fall was for men aged 18-24 years old. What is striking about these figures is that the number of people employed is shrinking. In the three months from August to October, there were 32 million people working: still a lot and more than a year ago. But it's 56,000 fewer than the previous three months. For most of the last six years - and indeed most of the last 30 - the workforce has been expanding. And it's happening in spite of 798,000 job vacancies. So we have a labour market that's tighter than ever - yet a workforce that's shrinking. How can that be happening? Well one possible answer you may already have guessed. It has a lot to do with the slowdown in immigration. And it rhymes with ""exit"". Howard Archer, chief economic adviser at the EY ITEM Club, said: ""The latest data suggest that UK labour market strength is currently being diluted by extended lacklustre UK economic activity, as well as heightened business uncertainties and concerns over the economic and political outlook including Brexit. ""There are also reports that employment growth in some sectors is being limited by a lack of suitable candidates."" However, he said that employment was ""still at a very high level"", with the rate at 75.1%. UK inflation rate at near six-year high Why is Christmas dinner more expensive this year?

"This video can not be played The 2017 'Arctic Report' showed that sea ice more than four years old has largely disappeared in the Arctic A warming, rapidly changing Arctic is the ""new normal"" and shows no signs of returning to the reliably frozen region of the past. This is according to the USNational Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Arctic Report Card,external. Director of the administration's Arctic Researcher Program, Dr Jeremy Mathis, said the region did a great service to the planet -  acting as a refrigerator. ""We've now left that refrigerator door open,"" he added. Dr Mathis was speaking at the annual American Geophysical Union meeting in New Orleans, where Noaa presented its annual summation of Arctic science. Starving polar bear: The 'face of climate change'? This is the 12th report the administration has produced. And although it pointed to ""a few anomalies"" in a recent pattern of warming in the Arctic region, Dr Mathis said: ""We can confirm, it will not stay in its reliably frozen state."" ""The thing I took that had the most resonance for me was we're able to use some really long-term records to put the Arctic change into context - going back more than 1,500 years. ""What's really alarming for me is that we're seeing the Arctic is changing faster than at any rate in recorded history."" The speed of change, Dr Mathis added, was making it very hard for people to adapt. ""Villages are being washed away, particularly in the North American Arctic - creating some of the first climate refugees,"" he said. ""And pace of sea level rise is increasing because the Arctic is warming faster than we anticipated even a decade ago."" This video can not be played Which cities might flood as the ice melts? Warmer air: Average annual air temperature over land was the second highest after 2016, with a temperature 1.6C above average. Declining sea ice: The maximum winter sea-ice area, measured each March, was the lowest ever observed. Sea ice is also getting thinner each year. Warmer ocean: Sea surface temperatures in August 2017 were 4C above the average in the Barents and Chukchi seas. Surface waters of the Chukchi Sea have warmed by more than half a degree C per decade since 1982. Plankton blooms: Springtime melting and retreating sea ice allows sunlight to reach the upper layers of the ocean, meaning more of these microscopic marine plants can photosynthesise. Greener tundra: Overall vegetation, including plants getting bigger and leafier and shrubs and trees taking over. Grassland or tundra, increased across the Arctic in 2015 and 2016, as measured by satellite. Ups and downs for snow: For the 11th year in the past 12, snow cover in the North American Arctic was below average, with communities experiencing earlier snow melt. The Eurasian part of the Arctic saw above average snow cover extent in 2017 - the first time that has happened since 2005. Less melt on Greenland Ice Sheet: Melting began early on the Greenland Ice Sheet in 2017, but slowed during a cooler summer, resulting in below-average melting when compared with the previous nine years. Overall, the Greenland Ice Sheet, a major contributor to sea-level rise, continued to lose mass this past year, as it has since 2002 when measurements began. Source: 2017 NOAA Arctic Report Card Scientists say it is clear that human-induced climate change is contributing to making the Arctic a warmer and more dynamic place. ""When we look at the darkening of the Arctic,"" said Dr Mathis, ""reflective, icy surfaces are melting to reveal darker surfaces that absorb more of the Sun's energy. Greening Arctic: Vegetation in the tundra is becoming 'bigger and leafier' ""So it probably only took a little bit of human-induced change to start the Arctic down this cascading pathway; a little bit of ice melting led to a little bit of warming, which led to more ice melting, which led to more warming. ""And now we're seeing an acceleration - a runaway effect that may eventually be a catastrophic runaway effect starting to take hold in the Arctic."" Oceanographer and retired US Navy Rear Admiral Timothy Gallaudet, who was appointed by the Trump Administration as acting administrator of Noaa, was asked during the Arctic report presentation about the response of the White House to the findings. Many scientists viewed President Trump's recent decision to withdraw the US from the Paris Climate Agreement as clear evidence of his scepticism about human-induced climate change. He said that the White House was ""addressing and acknowledging it and factoring it in to their agenda"". Dr Mathis added that information coming from this report was ""beyond reproach"". ""They're facts. Facts weighted in thousands and thousands of scientific measurements that have been validated and peer reviewed by a community of experts working in the area for decades. ""Policy-makers can use those facts as they see fit.""

"Theresa May has insisted Parliament will have a ""meaningful vote"" on the terms of Brexit as she faces the threat of a defeat in the Commons. The PM said MPs would have a say on the final deal before the UK exit in March 2019, but it must happen in a way that ensures a ""smooth and orderly"" exit. Tory rebels will join forces with Labour to seek an explicit legal guarantee in the EU Withdrawal Bill. Lead rebel Dominic Grieve said it was his time to ""stand up and be counted"". Parliament Live: MPs debate EU withdrawal bill What the EU Withdrawal Bill will do Kuenssberg: Who will blink first? Brexit Secretary David Davis has written to Tory MPs but Dominic Grieve - who is leading demands for a vote on any final Brexit deal before it is finalised - has said he will not back down. ""There is a time for everybody to stand up and be counted,"" the former attorney general told MPs. The day's debate on the EU bill is under way, with Mr Grieve's amendment due to be voted on later. The UK is due to leave the EU in March 2019, and negotiations are taking place on what their relationship will be in the future. The EU Withdrawal Bill is a key part of the government's exit strategy. Its effects include ending the supremacy of EU law and copying existing EU law into UK law, so that the same rules and regulations apply on Brexit day. The bill is currently making its way through Parliament, where MPs from across the House of Commons have been trying to amend it. So far it has emerged unscathed, but on Wednesday several rebels are lining up behind Mr Grieve's bid to ensure a ""meaningful vote"" on any final deal agreed with Brussels. This could be tricky for the government as it has no overall majority in the House of Commons. They want to change the EU Withdrawal Bill so the government is unable to implement the agreement it reaches with the EU unless MPs give the green light via a new Act of Parliament. They want to change a part of the bill that allows ministers to do this using secondary legislation, which has less scrutiny from MPs. Otherwise, they argue, Parliament might not get the final say on the terms of the UK's departure. The governmenthas already offereda take-it-or-leave-it vote on the final deal reached with Brussels and to enshrine the withdrawal agreement in a new Act of Parliament. But the rebels say that unless this is explicitly written into the bill, MPs and peers might get bypassed at the last minute. Ahead of the vote, Mr Davis wrote to all Conservative MPs on Wednesday morning promising ""a meaningful vote"" on Brexit. He said there will be a vote in Parliament ""as soon as possible"" after an agreement with the EU is reached, adding: ""Our entire approach to the bill has been to listen to MPs.""

Speaking during Prime Minister's Questions, Theresa May explained the government's objections to Mr Grieve's bid to require the Act of Parliament to be in force before ministers implement the deal. The new Act of Parliament might only be passed ""at a very late stage in the proceedings, which could mean that we are not able to have the orderly and smooth exit from the European Union that we wish to have"", she said. Both the UK and the EU currently say they want a deal by October 2018, to allow for the UK and European Parliaments to vote on it. We won't know until later, when Mr Grieve's amendment is debated. But he has claimed to have the numbers to inflict defeat on the government. Since the general election, where Theresa May lost the Tories' Commons majority, any vote has the potential to be close. The government needs the backing of Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party to get a working majority of 13, and several Conservative MPs have confirmed they will rebel. But will it be enough?

Labour has said it will support Mr Grieve's amendment, but what about its MPs that back Brexit - which way will they vote? One of the leading rebels told the BBC's Laura Kuenssberg ""it really may come down to the twos or threes"". By BBC assistant political editor Norman Smith I'm guessing everyone's a bit jaded with the endless Brexit rows and threats of revolts. But this one really does matter. This is the Big Bananas moment. And on that both sides seem to agree. It's not a minor, footling technical issue - it's about who's running the show, Parliament or the prime minister. Brexiteers view tonight's vote as an attempt by refusenik Remainers to de-rail Brexit. And, privately, some hard line Remainers see it as a means to fundamentally change the terms of the UK's departure from the EU.  Other rebels argue it's about making good the Brexiteers promise to ""take back control' to the UK Parliament. But it is also a Big Bananas moment for Theresa May. Defeat in the Commons - and it would be her first - would knock her premiership back on the ropes after she had bounced back with last week's deal in Brussels. It would also dent her authority in the Brexit negotiations with EU leaders, who would again question her ability to deliver a deal. May 'dancing to EU's tune' over Brexit - Farage Brexit talks are a furious race against time, says the EU Council Conservative MP Dominic Grieve (left) is leading the rebellion despite criticism from Eurosceptic MPs Man-of-the-moment Mr Grieve has set out his stall in the Commons, saying he cannot recall ever rebelling against his party before. However, he said: ""As Churchill said, 'he's a good party man - he puts the party before himself and the country before his party' and that's what I intend to do."" Mr Grieve and the other likely Tory rebels have faced criticism from some of their colleagues. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Former Tory leader Iain Duncan Smith said: ""There comes a moment when really grandstanding has to stop. Tying the government's hands in the way that he would wish to tie them so early on is quite wrong."" Mr Grieve criticised the ""hurling of public abuse"" and pointed to Mr Duncan Smith's own rebellions over Europe. Former education secretary Nicky Morgan told the BBC it was in the national interest for Parliament to have a ""final vote on the final deal"" and urged ministers to listen at ""this late stage"". Other likely rebels have also indicated they will not be backing down, without further concessions by the government.

"Eartha Pond has made the final 50 in a competition for the world's best teacher A London teacher who raised Â£100,000 for survivors of the Grenfell Tower fire and who plays top-level football has been named in the top 50 shortlist for the annual Global Teacher Prize. Eartha Pond is a finalist in the $1m (Â£750,000) teaching competition. The PE teacher, who plays for Tottenham Hotspur Ladies, is assistant vice-principal at the Crest Academy in Neasden, north-west London. She says it's great to see the value of teachers' work being recognised. The teachers in the final 50 are from 33 countries, in a competition run by the Varkey Foundation with the aim of raising the status of the teaching profession. Ms Pond, who trained as a teacher six years ago, has helped to run Girls Allowed clubs in schools, encouraging young women to take part in sport. As a footballer she played for Chelsea and Arsenal before signing for Spurs - and in teaching she has also been a top performer, with a strong record in results in sports qualifications. As a teacher, she says ""every day is a lesson"". And combining teaching with football, she says can feel like trying to live the lives of two people. She lives close to the site of the Grenfell Tower fire - and says that when she saw what had happened she began to raise funds. ""I hoped to raise Â£5,000,"" she said. But in the end she collected Â£80,000 and then a school's sports day and support from local businesses took the total to Â£100,000. ""It's my community, it was a natural reaction, my people needed help,"" she says of the efforts to support survivors. Ms Pond is one of four teachers from the UK in the top 50, in a shortlist drawn from more than 30,000 nominations. Also in the running are: Andria Zafirakou, an arts and textiles teacher from Alperton Community School, north-west London. She has learned several languages to engage with local communities and worked to encourage more of her pupils to get university places. Rebecca Cramer, head teacher and co-founder of Reach Academy Feltham, south-west London. In its first GCSE year, 98% of pupils achieved good grades in maths and English. Tuesday Humby, principal of Ormiston Chadwick Academy, Widnes, Cheshire. She has helped to widen the horizons of disadvantaged pupils, with an ""enrichment charter"" which offers residential trips, theatre visits and an overseas trip to Kenya. The winner will be presented next year with their prize at a ceremony in Dubai. Last year's winner was Maggie MacDonnell, who teaches at a remote village school in the Canadian Arctic and who has campaigned about the problem of youth suicides in the Inuit community. The winner was announced by a video-link with astronauts on the International Space Station and with a message from Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. Sunny Varkey, founder of the Varkey Foundation, congratulated the finalists and said: ""We intend to keep this momentum going as our journey continues to return teachers to their rightful position as one of the most respected professions in society.""

"Former prosecutor Doug Jones swung a historic victory in Alabama Alabama is a deeply conservative place, as its voting record amply demonstrates. Until Doug Jones came along the state hadn't picked a Democrat for the US Senate since 1992 - and even that man, Richard Shelby, went on to defect to the Republicans. But on 12 December Mr Jones, 63, painted the old red seat blue when voters chose him to fill Attorney General Jeff Sessions's former berth. So what do we know about the man who fought and beat Republican Roy Moore for the heart of Dixie? Mr Jones' victory has been credited to an unusually high turnout of black voters When Mr Jones beat seven other candidates to win the Democratic primary in August 2017, it was the entry pass to a seriously tough fight. But he would argue he's used to those. Gordon Douglas Jones, known as Doug, studied political science at the University of Alabama, followed by law at the state's Samford University in 1979. He rose to prominence in 1997, when Bill Clinton named him US Attorney for the Northern District of Alabama. Then in his forties, Mr Jones secured a string of high-profile prosecutions, including those oftwo Ku Klux Klan members,externalwho bombed a Baptist church in Birmingham in 1963, killing four black schoolgirls. The Baptist church at 16th Street had been a centre for civil rights activities in Birmingham, Alabama He was also linked to the indictment of Eric Rudolph, who killed an off-duty police officer in a 1998 attack on a Birmingham abortion clinic. This record has helped Mr Jones present as a candidate for our violent times, where white nationalists are raising their banners unafraid on the streets of America. ""Sadly, the pattern of violence as a response to hope has reasserted itself,"" he wrote in the Huffington Post.,external""We saw it in the Charleston church massacre in 2015. We saw it on display in Charlottesville this past August. We've seen it in the attacks on mosques and synagogues, and against the LGBT community. We see it in the hostility toward the Latino community. ""We cannot sweep this violence under the rug. We must address the forces that lead to it and prosecute those who perpetrate such acts."" Supporters of Mr Jones saw him as a moderate, a foil to Roy Moore's Bible-bashing Though Roy Moore's evangelical fervour grabbed more attention, Mr Jones is also a Christian - specifically, a Methodist. He has worshipped at the same church for more than 30 years, and has said the message of Christianity should be one of fairness and inclusivity, not extremism. Politics took an early hold on Jones, who began his career as a staff counsel to the US Senate Judiciary Committee, working for Alabama Senator Howell Heflin. From 1980 he spent four years as an Assistant US Attorney, then from 1984-97 worked for a criminal defence firm in Birmingham, Alabama. In 2013, he co-founded his own firm - Jones & Hawley. Mr Jones counts former Vice President Joe Biden as an old friend, having led his 1988 presidential campaign in Alabama. Mr Biden said of him at an October 2017 rally: ""I can count on two hands the people I've campaigned for that have as much integrity, as much courage."" He added that Mr Jones ""helped remove 40 years of stain and pain from this state"" with the church bombing convictions. The eyes of the world are on Alabama Trump in last plea for Alabama candidate Senate candidate Moore denies child sex abuse From the off, Mr Jones was aware he was facing poor odds in Alabama, which backed Donald Trump in 2016 with a 28-point landslide. ""They have told me time and again that this race is a long shot,"" Mr Jones said of the problem. ""Well, folks... When you are on the right side of history and the right side of justice, you can do anything."" The delicacy of the task was complicated by allegations against Mr Jones's anti-establishment opponent, Roy Moore. The gun-toting Republican faces several claims of historic sexual misconduct with underage girls, which he denies. Roy Moore is facing allegations of sexual abuse, which he denies Mr Jones's campaign adverts have worked to paint him as the ethical choice for Alabama, even as prominent national Republicans broke ranks to refuse Mr Moore their votes. Some ads featured self-declared Republican voters voicing their support for Mr Jones with the words: ""Don't vote for the party. Vote for the man."" The New York Times reported in mid-November that Democrat cash had funded nearly $2m (Â£1.5m) in TV adverts for Mr Jones,external, while Mr Moore had spent only about $300,000. Allow Twitter content?

Policy-wise, Mr Jones has pitched himself as a moderate Democrat, calling for an increase in the minimum wage, but also lower corporate taxes ""to try to get reinvestment back into this country"". He supports renewable energy, but is hawkish on the need for increased defence spending, saying it will protect the US and shore up Alabama's economy. On healthcare, a key divide between Republicans and Democrats, he opposes the repeal of the Affordable Care Act, known as Obamacare, but wants changes to the existing ""broken"" system. Things Republican Roy Moore believes Trump deletes tweets after backing loser While President Trump has stoutly supported Roy Moore, national stars of the Democratic Party waited until the last minute to descend on Alabama, to avoid spooking voters with their liberal associations. On the eve of the election, reports said former President Barack Obama had recorded a robo-call - an automated telephone call to Alabama households - urging the public to back his man. Former President Barack Obama stepped in at the final hour to rally voters for Doug Jones ""This one's serious,"" Mr Obama said in the message, according to CNN. ""You can't sit it out."" Other senior Democrats who have spoken for Mr Jones include Ohio congressman Tim Ryan, and John Lewis, a revered civil rights leader who was one of the original Freedom Riders and led a famous protest march from Selma in Alabama. New Jersey Senator Cory Booker, a rising Democrat star considered a possible 2020 presidential candidate, made the trip to Alabama in person, declaring: ""I'm here to try and help some folk get woke. Democracy is not a spectator sport."" Mr Jones has proved he is capable of causing a stunning upset in the ruby red Yellowhammer state. Now he'll be returning to work for the federal government for the first time since making his name with the church bombing prosecutions.

"Rex Tillerson arrives at the Atlantic Council policy forum to discuss North Korea The US is ""ready to talk any time"" with North Korea without preconditions, says Secretary of State Rex Tillerson. His statement appeared to shift the US position away from previous demands that North Korea must disarm before any talks can be held. But hours later the White House said President Donald Trump's views on North Korea ""had not changed"". North Korea's pursuit of nuclear weapons technology has led to heavy US-led sanctions against the regime. Separately, the UN's political chiefJeffrey Feltman, who recently visited Pyongyang,told reporters that North Korean officials felt it was ""important to prevent war"". Analysis: Tillerson's tumultuous year North Korea: What could tip the balance? China and Russia both welcomed Mr Tillerson's comments. The Chinese foreign ministry hoped there would now be ""meaningful steps towards dialogue and contact"" between the US and the North. Russian President Vladimir Putin's spokesman said: ""Such constructive statements impress us far more than the confrontational rhetoric that we have heard up to now."" Diplomatic relations between the US and North Korea have been strained by recent North Korean nuclear and missile tests, and by a war of words between Mr Trump and North Korea's leader Kim Jong-un. Speaking at the Atlantic Council policy forum on Tuesday, Mr Tillerson said the US ""simply cannot accept a nuclear armed North Korea"". Appearing to soften the US stance towards potential future talks, he said: ""Let's just meet and let's talk about the weather if you want and talk about whether it's going to be a square table or a round table if that's what you're excited about. ""Then we can begin to lay out a map, a road map, of what we might be willing to work towards."" This video can not be played How could war with North Korea unfold? But he insisted that there needed to be a ""period of quiet"" first, without any nuclear or missile tests. He added that economic and diplomatic sanctions would continue until ""the first bomb drops"", and Mr Trump still wanted China - Pyongyang's main economic ally - to cut off oil supplies to North Korea. Mr Tillerson also said China had made contingency plans to accommodate North Korean refugees in the event of a conflict, a major concern for China. What missiles does North Korea have? Why is the latest test still producing aftershocks? What did N Korea's nuclear tests achieve? Several hours after his comments, White House press secretary Sarah Sanders released a statement to reporters saying Mr Trump's views ""have not changed"". ""North Korea is acting in an unsafe way not only toward Japan, China, and South Korea, but the entire world. North Korea's actions are not good for anyone and certainly not good for North Korea."" On Wednesday, North Korean state media said Kim Jong-un had vowed his country would become ""the strongest nuclear power and military power in the world"". Speaking at a munitions industry conference, he citedNorth Korea's recent launch of intercontinental ballistic missile Hwasong-15as a ""great historic victory"". The UN's Jeffrey Feltman said that while senior North Korean officials did not offer any commitments, they had agreed that discussions should continue. ""They agreed that it was important to prevent war,"" he said, in his first briefing since his four-day trip last week.

"John Cleese and Eric Idle re-create a Monty Python sketch about boasting about a tough childhood Ofsted chief Amanda Spielman has warned that underperforming schools can get caught in a culture of ""disadvantage one-upmanship"", where schools focus too much on their pupils' deprivation. She likened it to a Monty Python comedy sketch where people compete with claims to have had the toughest childhood. Ms Spielman was presenting her annual report, which highlighted a small core of persistently underachieving schools. But she said disadvantage was not an excuse for low achievement. The Ofsted chief suggested schools seemed sometimes to be competing over how many pupils were on free school meals or how many did not speak English as a first language. ""I think people become absorbed by this narrative,"" said Ms Spielman at the launch of the annual report from England's education watchdog. ""They've got big and daunting challenges, but we want to encourage people to look past them. We want them to focus on what can be done."" She likened it to theFour Yorkshiremen comedy sketch performed by Monty Python, where characters make increasingly exaggerated claims about hardship when they were growing up. The annual report says 90% of primary schools are now good or outstanding The report highlighted schools from this year's round of inspections which had repeatedly failed to improve, with around 80 primary and 50 secondary schools below the level of ""good"" in inspections since 2005. There are also about about 500 primary and 200 secondary schools which have been rated as requiring improvement on their previous two inspections. These struggling schools were most likely to be in disadvantaged areas with a high proportion of poor white pupils, to have a high turnover of staff, and heads and teachers facing ""burnout"". But Ms Spielman said that there were thousands of other schools facing similar challenges which were performing much better. The annual report shows that overall 90% of all primary schools and 79% of secondary schools are rated good or outstanding. Although outstanding schools are no longer routinely inspected - and almost one in 10 have not been inspected in the past 10 years. But the Ofsted chief said against a positive backdrop it would still be wrong to ""turn a blind eye"" to weaknesses. She warned of an ongoing problem with unregistered religious schools which were operating illegally and which could be teaching extremist views and seeking to ""isolate young people from the mainstream"". Ofsted chief Amanda Spielman warns of struggling schools where teachers 'burn out' Ofsted has warned for several years of children beingtaught in squalid conditions with inadequate lessons. Ms Spielman called for stronger rights for inspectors to intervene and seize evidence, such as books or documentation. She warned of such schools promoting sexist or homophobic views. Ms Spielman's report also raised particular concerns about education standards in young offenders institutions, which she said could be ""extremely poor"". ""Without access to a proper, decent learning and training we are passing de facto life sentences on young offenders,"" she said. Responding to concerns about schools which seemed to have ""intractable"" difficulties in improving, heads' leader Geoff Barton said Ofsted could be part of the problem. When schools were ""stigmatised"" by bad Ofsted reports, recruiting staff and pupils became more difficult and schools could be ""trapped in cycles of underperformance"", said Mr Barton, leader of the ASCL head teachers' union. He said the problem was exacerbated by a ""teacher recruitment and retention crisis"" and the ""underfunding of schools"". Paul Whiteman, leader of the National Association of Head Teachers, said the high performance of so many schools was ""all the more remarkable against the backdrop of austerity and all the added pressures that brings"". Angela Rayner, Labour's shadow education secretary, said: ""The fact that under the Tories schools have consistently struggled to improve, have struggled to recruit staff and had high levels of turnover should come as a wake-up call."" A Department for Education spokeswoman said: ""We are targeting the areas that need the most support through our opportunity areas. ""And by investing Â£280m over the next two years to target resources at the schools most in need to improve school performance and deliver more good school places.""

"Household water bills in England and Wales will fall by between Â£15 and Â£25 a year from 2020 to 2025, the regulator Ofwat has pledged. A forthcoming price review will give water companies less wiggle room to recover the costs of debt and equity from customers, the regulator said. Ofwat wascriticised by an influential government committeein 2016 for overestimating water firms' costs. Water UK, said it was a ""tough challenge from Ofwat"". Consumers can look forward to a real terms fall in water bills, Ofwat said. Since privatisation in 1989, water bills have risen above inflation by about 40%, leading to a debate about whether privatisation works for that industry. The regulator's chief executive, Cathryn Ross, told the BBC: ""We have an early view on the financing costs that we're going to enable companies to recover from their customers. ""That's the biggest single driver of the bill. Financing costs are about a third of the average bill."" She said those financing costs for water companies had come down from 3.74% in 2014 to 2.4% now, and that difference can be passed on to customers. But companies are allowed to add the cost of inflation on to bills. So from 2020, customers will be paying less than they would have been paying had the price controls not been set at that level by Ofwat, but there may not be an actual, noticeable fall in the bill. Michael Roberts, Chief Executive of Water UK, said Ofwat's review would be ""tougher for some companies than others"". However, he added: "" The industry has a strong track record in providing customers with a world class product and service. ""We've cut bills, increased help for the less well-off, and reduced leakage by a third, and we are committed to achieving even more for customers in the future."" The final Ofwat price review will be published in 2019. Analysis: BBC Today programme business presenter Dominic O'Connell Jeremy Corbyn has a simple remedy for the perceived excessive profits and underperformance of water companies - nationalisation. Ofwat's answer is not so easily digestible - 260 pages of dense regulatorese, full of catchy concepts like the ""weighted average cost of capital for appointee companies"". The headline savings promised, just Â£15 to Â£25 a year from an average bill in the five years from 2020, will also not set many hearts racing. Ofwat's problem is that the companies it regulates have by and large prospered despite its successive attempts to crack down on returns. Severn Trent, the largest quoted water company - one that has shares listed on the stock exchange - has promised its shareholders dividends of inflation plus 4% for the foreseeable future, an astonishing return for what is a low-risk utility stock. Ofwat needs to find a much sharper tool if its solution, rather than Mr Corbyn's, is to catch the public imagination. Ms Ross said nationalisation would be a political decision, but that since privatisation, water firms had invested Â£140bn. ""There has to be a question about whether government would do that if that were to land on the public balance sheet, but of course, government can borrow more cheaply,"" she said. In a price review, Ofwat looks at the costs of financing that water firms face; the costs of service, such as how much it costs to transport water or treat it; and it looks at how water firms can improve their service. In 2016, the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) said Ofwat had consistently overestimated water companies' costs. Ms Ross said the regulator had taken a view in 2009 of what the financing costs would be, and ""actually the financing costs were a lot lower than that, and that's really why the MPs were criticising us"". ""We've taken that on board, and that's why today... we're taking a tougher line,"" she added. The Consumer Council for Water, a watchdog, said an Ofwat decision to get rid of a cap on rewards for beating performance targets ""could open the door to bill instability"" after 2019. Tony Smith, the watchdog's chief executive, said: ""This could hand companies an opportunity to claw back some of the money they would be unable to get through lower financing costs and it could lead to bill increases which many customers view as rewards for doing the day job.""

"Eartha Pond has made the final 50 in a competition for the world's best teacher A London teacher who raised Â£100,000 for survivors of the Grenfell Tower fire and who plays top-level football has been named in the top 50 shortlist for the annual Global Teacher Prize. Eartha Pond is a finalist in the $1m (Â£750,000) teaching competition. The PE teacher, who plays for Tottenham Hotspur Ladies, is assistant vice-principal at the Crest Academy in Neasden, north-west London. She says it's great to see the value of teachers' work being recognised. The teachers in the final 50 are from 33 countries, in a competition run by the Varkey Foundation with the aim of raising the status of the teaching profession. Ms Pond, who trained as a teacher six years ago, has helped to run Girls Allowed clubs in schools, encouraging young women to take part in sport. As a footballer she played for Chelsea and Arsenal before signing for Spurs - and in teaching she has also been a top performer, with a strong record in results in sports qualifications. As a teacher, she says ""every day is a lesson"". And combining teaching with football, she says can feel like trying to live the lives of two people. She lives close to the site of the Grenfell Tower fire - and says that when she saw what had happened she began to raise funds. ""I hoped to raise Â£5,000,"" she said. But in the end she collected Â£80,000 and then a school's sports day and support from local businesses took the total to Â£100,000. ""It's my community, it was a natural reaction, my people needed help,"" she says of the efforts to support survivors. Ms Pond is one of four teachers from the UK in the top 50, in a shortlist drawn from more than 30,000 nominations. Also in the running are: Andria Zafirakou, an arts and textiles teacher from Alperton Community School, north-west London. She has learned several languages to engage with local communities and worked to encourage more of her pupils to get university places. Rebecca Cramer, head teacher and co-founder of Reach Academy Feltham, south-west London. In its first GCSE year, 98% of pupils achieved good grades in maths and English. Tuesday Humby, principal of Ormiston Chadwick Academy, Widnes, Cheshire. She has helped to widen the horizons of disadvantaged pupils, with an ""enrichment charter"" which offers residential trips, theatre visits and an overseas trip to Kenya. The winner will be presented next year with their prize at a ceremony in Dubai. Last year's winner was Maggie MacDonnell, who teaches at a remote village school in the Canadian Arctic and who has campaigned about the problem of youth suicides in the Inuit community. The winner was announced by a video-link with astronauts on the International Space Station and with a message from Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. Sunny Varkey, founder of the Varkey Foundation, congratulated the finalists and said: ""We intend to keep this momentum going as our journey continues to return teachers to their rightful position as one of the most respected professions in society.""

"This video can not be played My close escape from Â£10,000 bank scam Seventy-two-year-old Barry Fox is one of hundreds of people saved from scams after bank staff stopped him spending Â£10,000 on a fictitious Rolls-Royce. The retired lorry driver went into his Barclays branch intending to withdraw the cash to pay for the luxury car he saw on an internet auction site. Staff were concerned and used a new system to alert police to the case and, within 30 minutes, officers were there. They made checks and alerted Mr Fox to the fact he was about to be scammed. This was one of 1,262 calls made by bank staff to police or trading standards under the Banking Protocol system that should see an officer arrive to offer help within an hour. UK Finance, which represents the major banks, said this had saved potential victims a combined total of Â£9.1m in its first year of operation. Individuals had been saved between Â£99 and Â£212,000 each. Mr Fox had received some inheritance and decided to spend it on his dream car. The seller told him that they would pick him up from a railway station and then travel to a countryside location to pick up the car. He would pay Â£10,000 in cash. Bank staff said it ""didn't seem right"". The police officers alerted him to the fact that the car was registered hundreds of miles away. The details of the seller on eBay did not match the business which had the car, so there was no realistic possibility of buying it. ""I might have gone there with Â£10,000 in my pocket and been knocked over the head with a stick or something,"" said Mr Fox. 'I risk death threats to expose scammers' Queensland police python photo gains internet fame 'Meghan Markle' and 'fidget spinners' top UK Google search Mr Fox was simply advised not to take out the money in this case. Eventually he bought another Rolls-Royce being sold legitimately. In other cases in the last 12 months, 101 arrests have been made after calls were made by concerned bank staff. The system has been introduced gradually across the country since May and nearly all UK police forces are now signed up. Katy Worobec, from UK Finance, said: ""The finance industry is determined to crack down on fraud and is taking action on all fronts. The protocol is an important weapon in our armoury."" Other cases of fraud prevention by banks include: A man who was conned into thinking he was being contacted via Facebook by a long-lost girlfriend, who then asked him to turn up at the airport with a parcel of cash to help deal with formalities A woman who was rung by a scammer who claimed her computer had all sorts of problems. He persuaded her to give him online access to her computer and installed malware. Then he made a big apology and promised compensation. He sent too much money and demanded the difference back in cash, but the original payment would have never gone through A man came into the branch asking for thousands of pounds in cash, intending to bury it in the garden so he could get to it quickly when needed. Police explained to him that he could be robbed if information about the stash leaked out and that the banknotes could be ruined One consumer group said the system should be extended to other types of scam. Alex Neill, of Which?, said this was a small part of a wider problem. ""In the first six months of 2017, more than Â£100m was lost to bank transfer scams,"" she said. She urged banks to introduce ""similarly robust measures"" to deal with online scams ""where consumers remain vulnerable"".

"Rupert Murdoch with his third wife, Jerry Hall Walt Disney is close to confirming a deal to buy 21st Century Fox's entertainment assets for about $60bn, reports say. The sale would include the 20th Century Fox film studio and the Sky and Star satellite broadcasters in the UK, Europe and Asia. Disney was left as the front runner after Comcast, the NBC owner, dropped out of the race on Monday. The Financial Times,externalsaid talks about the price were continuing on Tuesday. CNBC reported,externalthat Fox and Disney were on a ""glide path"" for an announcement on Thursday, according to people familiar with the negotiations. The Murdoch family was said to favour a deal with Disney because it would rather be paid in the entertainment giant's shares than Comcast stock. A deal with Disney could also face fewer US regulatory hurdles, although it is extremely unlikely to be waved through. Also in question is what will happen to 21st Century Fox's bid to buy the 61% of Sky that it does not already own. The deal is already under scrutiny by the UK Competition and Markets Authority (CMA), which is expected to publish its provisional findings in January. It is not clear whether Disney will continue with the takeover if it buys the 39% stake from 21st Century Fox as part of the wider transaction. Matthew Horsman, analyst at Mediatique, told Variety magazine that the CMA is likely to continue probing the deal. ""They've done all the work. I'm pretty sure they're going to announce a decision,"" he said. How 21st Century Fox fits into the Murdoch empire The assets being sold by Fox include its FX and National Geographic cable channels, 22 regional US sports networks and the company's stake in the Hulu streaming platform in the US. It would also add to Disney's extensive film and television library, with movies such as Avatar and Deadpool, as well as small screen hits including The Simpsons and Modern Family. The Fox broadcast network, Fox News and Fox Sports would remain under the Murdochs' control. As well as its film studio, Disney also owns the ESPN sports network and cable channels. Mr Murdoch's decision to sell most of Fox has surprised many commentators given his desire to continually expand his media empire over the past five decades. Talks were understood to have been held between the two companies in November but did not result in an agreement. Negotiations then restarted earlier this month. Shares in Disney rose 0.5% in New York on Tuesday, valuing the company at $162bn, while 21st Century Fox added 1%, valuing it at $62.6bn. Fox shares have jumped by close to a third over the past three months.

"This video can not be played Many in Alabama still back the controversial Republican candidate Sexual misconduct claims against an already-controversial candidate have thrust a US Senate race into the global spotlight - and highlighted divisions between President Trump and top Republicans. Question: Just how interested is the world in the Alabama election tomorrow? Answer: A reporter from Moldova is down there. It's pretty much all you need to know. News organisations from foreign countries love stories about America that expose its weaknesses. They always have done. It can sometimes be explained asschadenfreude, an almost indecent glee when things are perceived to have gone wrong in the world's superpower. The riots in Ferguson, the shooting of Trayvon Martin, Hurricane Katrina, the financial crash, and now the Alabama race. Those reporters would not normally fly to the Deep South to cover a mere US Senate race, especially one that should have been a straightforward Republican win in this conservative state. Then again, you don't often get a candidate who believes homosexuality should be illegal, Muslims should be banned from serving in Congress and the last time America was great was when there was slavery. That's the Republican, Roy Moore. Moore supporters packed a barn to hear him speak earlier this month I deliberately omitted the sex allegations there because his record, even without serious claims of child molestation (which he denies), make him extreme, even by the standards of conservative, evangelical, Southern politicians. The world's press probably would not have descended on Alabama for Tuesday's vote had it not been for the sexual harassment stories, but they should have done. This was a fascinating story of America before that. Things Republican Roy Moore believes Trump in last plea for Alabama Republican The story that highlights an ugly American tribalism And it's a fascinating indication of the state of American politics today. The Alabama race has split the Republican party. Donald Trump this weekend recorded a phone message in support of Roy Moore and at a rally in Florida urged Alabamians to vote for him. The president warned the Trump agenda could be at risk if the Democrats win the seat and reduce the Republican's already-narrow majority in the Senate. The failed effort to repeal and replace Obamacare earlier this year proved how fragile the party's control of the Senate is. They desperately want to avoid a similar fate when it comes to upcoming votes on tax cuts. Yet, other top Republicans, including the sitting senator for Alabama, have said they can't vote for Mr Moore because of the allegations against him. Senator Richard Shelby is popular in the conservative state so it will be interesting to see whether his denunciation of Mr Moore has an impact at the polls. This video can not be played Alabama evangelicals at a crossroads over Roy Moore Plenty of Alabamians are sticking by the candidate. Roy Moore has what's been described as an almost ""cult-like"" following in Alabama. He's the ultimate beneficiary of today's tribal politics. His supporters believe he embodies Christian values, will stand to bring the Bible back into politics and is prepared to defy politicians in Washington. They see him as a true conservative who will consistently fight their side in America's bitter culture wars. But it's not his faith nor his opposition to abortion, immigration, and government that make him exceptional by US standards. Roy Moore has attracted controversy throughout his career Over the years he has said things that can in total fairness be described as discriminatory, things that might have been expected to kill a political career. And yet his aspirations have thrived and he may well be about to become an American senator. In 2006, Mr Moore wrote an editorial comparing the Koran to Hitler's Mein Kampf. The piece argued Muslims should not be allowed to serve in the US Congress. In a television interview in 2005 he said he believes ""homosexual conduct should be illegal"". Moore has also said Vladimir Putin, who says it's his duty to stop gay marriage, may be right on the issue. Despite America's formal separation of church and state, Mr Moore believes ""god's laws are always superior to man's"". He says Christianity should be favoured by the state. In 1997, he suggested a link between teaching evolution in schools and drive-by shootings. Democrat Doug Jones hopes to upset the odds in this deeply conservative state And, yes, he told an African-American at a rally during this campaign that America was last great during the time of slavery ""when families were united - even though we had slavery"". All that made the Alabama race extraordinary even before eight women came forward to accuse him of sexual misconduct. One of them says she was just 14 at the time he allegedly assaulted her. Why people are posting #MeAt14 Why so many sexual harassment cases in US, not UK? In the #MeToo moment that was what really got the world's attention. But think about all the other things Mr Moore has said and this story should have grabbed our headlines from the beginning.

"This video can not be played Roy Moore: 'Sexual perversion and sodomy sweep this land' Alabama firebrand Roy Moore dealt a huge blow to the Republican leadership by winning the party's nomination for the Senate, despite their backing for his opponent. He is now battling Democrat Doug Jones for a place in the upper chamber of Congress. The controversial lawyer has made headlines for a series of incendiary remarks over the years. Here's a round-up of some of his more extreme beliefs, with some analysis from the BBC's Anthony Zurcher on why it all matters. On election day, Moore's spokesman Ted Crockett was asked whether the candidate still thought homosexuality should be outlawed. ""Probably,"" was his answer. Previously, Mr Moore haslikened it to bestiality,external, and called it ""abhorrent, immoral, detestable, a crime against nature, and a violation of the laws of nature and of nature's God upon which this nation and our laws are predicated"". His refusal to issue marriage certificates to gay couples cost him his place on the bench for a second time. Moore has suggested that the 11 September 2001 attacks against the World Trade Center and the Pentagon were a sign of God's divine anger. ""Sounds a little bit like the Pentagon"" he remarked after reading a Bible passage about ""the great slaughter when the towers will fall"". He has also said thatviolent crimes in the USsuch as murder and rape are ""happening because we have forgotten God"". He appeared to use pejorative racial terms for Asians and Native Americansat a rally this month,external.""We have blacks and whites fighting, reds and yellows fighting, Democrats and Republicans fighting, men and women fighting. What's going to unite us? What's going to bring us back together? A president? A Congress? No. It's going to be God."" ""There's no such thing as evolution,"" hetold the Washington Post,externalless than a week before the election. ""That we came from a snake? No I don't believe that."" It is also a threat to US laws, Moore claims. Over the summerhe falsely alleged,externalthat Sharia law was already being enforced in parts of the states of Illinois and Indiana, offering no evidence. ""God is the only source of our law, liberty and government,"" hesaid from the debate stage,externallast week. In August he directly praised the Russian president Vladimir Putin for his gay rights stance, saying ""maybe he's more akin to me than I know"". The comment came after he described the US as ""the focus of evil in the world"" because ""we promote a lot of bad things"". Trump's predecessor was disqualified to be president, Moore claimed as far back as 2008. The so-called ""birther"" theory, alleging that Obama was born in Kenya, was heavily promoted by Donald Trump until very late in his campaign. And he has occasionally been known to give live renditions. One said: ""Babies piled in dumpsters, Abortion on demand/ Oh Sweet land of liberty; your house is on the sand."" He was dismissed from the Alabama Supreme Court after he refused a federal order to remove a massive stone statue of the Ten Commandments from inside his courthouse. Roy Moore's willingness to buck the establishment, offer full-throated support for often-controversial evangelical issues and even defy federal court orders won him a loyal following in the heart of the Bible belt. Some of his views are extreme - offensive, even, to many Americans - but as with Donald Trump, the ex-judge's willingness to unapologetically speak his mind helped make him a vessel for frustrated Alabama voters looking to send a message to a Washington establishment they view as still firmly in control. Mr Moore's opponent, Luther Strange, was also flawed - an uninspiring candidate appointed to his Senate perch by a scandal-plagued governor. The national Republican Party poured money into the race to boost Mr Strange, but the appearance that the senator was the pick of political insiders probably did more harm than good. Motivated supporters willing to vote in droves in a low-turnout special primary is certainly a top reason why Mr Moore is now one step away from being Alabama's next US senator. Who Mr Moore isn't - a Washington insider, a typical politician, Luther Strange - helped a lot, as well.

"Rex Tillerson arrives at the Atlantic Council policy forum to discuss North Korea The US is ""ready to talk any time"" with North Korea without preconditions, says Secretary of State Rex Tillerson. His statement appeared to shift the US position away from previous demands that North Korea must disarm before any talks can be held. But hours later the White House said President Donald Trump's views on North Korea ""had not changed"". North Korea's pursuit of nuclear weapons technology has led to heavy US-led sanctions against the regime. Separately, the UN's political chiefJeffrey Feltman, who recently visited Pyongyang,told reporters that North Korean officials felt it was ""important to prevent war"". Analysis: Tillerson's tumultuous year North Korea: What could tip the balance? China and Russia both welcomed Mr Tillerson's comments. The Chinese foreign ministry hoped there would now be ""meaningful steps towards dialogue and contact"" between the US and the North. Russian President Vladimir Putin's spokesman said: ""Such constructive statements impress us far more than the confrontational rhetoric that we have heard up to now."" Diplomatic relations between the US and North Korea have been strained by recent North Korean nuclear and missile tests, and by a war of words between Mr Trump and North Korea's leader Kim Jong-un. Speaking at the Atlantic Council policy forum on Tuesday, Mr Tillerson said the US ""simply cannot accept a nuclear armed North Korea"". Appearing to soften the US stance towards potential future talks, he said: ""Let's just meet and let's talk about the weather if you want and talk about whether it's going to be a square table or a round table if that's what you're excited about. ""Then we can begin to lay out a map, a road map, of what we might be willing to work towards."" This video can not be played How could war with North Korea unfold? But he insisted that there needed to be a ""period of quiet"" first, without any nuclear or missile tests. He added that economic and diplomatic sanctions would continue until ""the first bomb drops"", and Mr Trump still wanted China - Pyongyang's main economic ally - to cut off oil supplies to North Korea. Mr Tillerson also said China had made contingency plans to accommodate North Korean refugees in the event of a conflict, a major concern for China. What missiles does North Korea have? Why is the latest test still producing aftershocks? What did N Korea's nuclear tests achieve? Several hours after his comments, White House press secretary Sarah Sanders released a statement to reporters saying Mr Trump's views ""have not changed"".

"A row has broken out over advice given to police in England and Wales telling them not to stop and search people only because they smell of cannabis. It was first given to police last year and was reiterated by an Inspectorate of Constabulary report on Tuesday. The advice says officers should look at other factors like behaviour as well. But some officers, including the chief constable of Merseyside Police, said they disagreed. The College of Policing said it plans to review the guidance. Police officers can use stop-and-search powers if they have ""reasonable grounds"" to suspect someone is carrying items such as drugs, weapons or stolen property. Last year, they were given new guidance by the College of Policing that the smell of cannabis on its own would not normally justify stopping and searching someone or their vehicle. Stop-and-search ethnic disparity 'troubling' BBC reporter: 'Police used stop-and-search on me' Reality Check: Are fewer black people being stopped and searched? But the Inspectorate of Constabulary said many officers were unaware of the guidance and it is now urging forces to encourage officers to not rely on a smell alone. However, Chief Constable Andy Cooke, of Merseyside Police, said he would not be giving that advice to his teams. He tweeted:,external""I disagree. The guidance in my view is wrong and the law does not preclude it. ""Smell of cannabis is sufficient to stop search and I will continue to encourage my officers to use it particularly on those criminals who are engaged in serious and organised crime."" Matt Locke, of Northumbria Police, described the guidance as ""inconsistent"", adding that it was ""a bit of a dog's dinner"". Allow Twitter content?

Another police officer, from North Yorkshire Police,tweeted:,external""If I smell cannabis on someone or coming from a vehicle then I'll conduct a search. I don't think there's a cop in this land that wouldn't. ""Recently not only had that led to me seizing quantities of cannabis, but also arresting drivers showing with it in their system.""

Mike Cunningham, HM Inspector of Constabulary,responded to questions on social media about the guidance,externalby saying the smell of cannabis ""can be reasonable grounds"" to search but it will be ""for the officer to explain"". He added that the advice ""encourages multiple grounds"" to merit a stop and search. The row came after the Inspectorate of Constabulary analysed more than 8,500 stop and search records and found almost 600 were conducted solely because police could smell cannabis. Searches based on other grounds, such as the suspect's behaviour, result in more arrests, the report said. At the heart of this row is an important question: are too many people being needlessly stopped and searched for drugs? The Inspectorate report drops a heavy hint that they are. It says police carried out 3,698 searches, 43% of the sample, because officers believed a suspect had drugs on them for their own use, even though drug possession offences may not be ""priority crimes"". The watchdog is concerned about this, firstly, because drug possession searches are not necessarily the best use of police time; and secondly, because they appear to affect ethnic minority groups disproportionately. That's one of the key reasons why the Inspectorate has reinforced the College of Policing guidance on stop and searches, including the advice about smelling cannabis - even though it's caused a stink.

The report said it was ""troubling"" that black people were eight times more likely to be stopped than white people. At the same time, black people were less likely to have illegal substances found on them than white people. The National Police Chiefs' Council said it was looking at why young black men were disproportionately stopped. The NPCC said stop-and-search powers were important ""with rising knife and gun crime"", as well as being a deterrent for people considering carrying out acid attacks.

"Toni & Guy opened their first salon in Clapham during the 1960s The co-founder of the hairdresser chain Toni & Guy - Giuseppe ""Toni"" Mascolo - has died at the age of 75. Mr Mascolo and his brother, Gaetano 'Guy' Mascolo, opened their first  salon in south London in 1963. Offering an ""Italian style"" hairdressing service, the unisex salon grew into an international brand and staple of the British high street. Mr Mascolo, who was the chief executive of the firm, died on Sunday surrounded by his family. The Mascolo family were Italian immigrants who arrived in England in the 1950s They settled in Clapham, south London, where the brothers opened their first salon. Hairdressing ran in the family and Mr Mascolo senior - a celebrated hairdresser in his own right - taught all four of his sons to cut hair from a young age. Founded during the ""swinging sixties"", Toni and Guy offered a unisex service that appealed to both men and women, in contrast to traditional barber shops and woman-only hair salons. Celebrities such as composer Andrew Lloyd Webber, and singer Dusty Springfield were among the famous faces who frequented the salon. The firm opened its first central London salon in London's West End in 1973. Shortly afterwards two more Mascolo brothers, Bruno and Anthony, helped propel the family business into an international brand. Since then Toni & Guy has grown to comprise two global, franchised hair salon groups, with 475 shops in 48 countries. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"The vouchers enable meals to be provided for homeless people More than 20,000 pre-paid meals were bought for homeless people within 10 hours of a festive campaign being launched. Itison began its fourth annual festive fundraiser for Social Bite on Tuesday. Within 10 hours, 20,668 vouchers had been donated to help feed rough sleepers in Scotland. On Saturday,about 9,000 spent the night in Princes Street Gardens in Edinburghas part of Sleep in the Park, organised by Social Bite. Josh Littlejohn, co-founder of Social Bite, said: ""Before our first Itison fundraiser in 2014, we were a small social enterprise and often ran out of food donated through our pay-it-forward scheme, and would have to turn people away or ask them to come back later. This video can not be played Organisers say Sleep in the Park was about more than raising money ""After the first Itison fundraiser ran, we were completely blown away by the response - over 32,000 vouchers were donated, allowing us to provide meals not just on Christmas Day but right throughout the year. ""Each year it gets bigger and bigger and since it launched we've never had to turn away a single person which is just incredible."" Last year, 75,755 vouchers were donated on Itison, allowing Social Bite to provide hot meals for homeless people throughout the year. The food firm's Glasgow, Edinburgh and Aberdeen cafes will open their doors to serve rough sleepers on Christmas Eve and Christmas Day to serve dinners with all the trimmings. All the money raised will go to Social Bite. Liam Gallagher, John Cleese and Deacon Blue performed at Sleep in the Park. Oli Norman, chief executive of Itison, said: ""Around 18 of us took part in Social Bite's Sleep In The Park at the weekend and that teeny glimpse into what it's like sleeping in the freezing cold highlighted just how wrong it is that in this day in age, people are still having to sleep rough in such treacherous conditions.""
