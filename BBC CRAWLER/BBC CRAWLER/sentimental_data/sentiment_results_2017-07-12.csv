"The UK housing market is in a state of lethargy, according to property surveyors, with estate agents reporting the lowest stock of properties for nearly 40 years. Members of theRoyal Institution of Chartered Surveyors,external(RICS) said the market might continue ""flatlining"" for a while. New instructions in June fell for the 16th month in a row. Most surveyors also saw further falls in the number of properties being sold. The average number of homes on the books of estate agents fell to 42.5 - the lowest number since the survey started in January 1978. ""Political uncertainty"" was given by 44% of surveyors as the main reason for the pessimism - nearly double the number who blamed Brexit. Simon Rubinsohn, RICS' chief economist, said that uncertainty seemed to be ""exerting itself on transaction levels, which are flat-lining, and may continue to do so for a while, particularly given the ongoing challenge presented by the low level of stock on the market"". Separately, the Bank of England's latestCredit Conditions Survey,externalof banks and building societies has suggested that home buyers could find it trickier to find mortgage deals with low deposits in the months ahead. The survey found lenders were likely to rein in lending as they become more cautious about the state of the economy. Lenders expect a slight reduction in mortgage availability to house buyers with deposits of less than 25%, and ""in particular"" those with a deposit of below 10%. The survey also found that unsecured lending - which includes credit cards - had fallen in the second quarter of the year, and was expected to drop further in the third quarter. Last week, the Halifax, Britain's largest lender,reported that prices fellby 1% in June, with annual growth slipping to 2.6%. The RICS survey suggests that property values actually rose during the month. However, that hides an increasing regional divide in price growth. Five years ago, prices in the south of the country were roaring ahead of prices in the north, but now there has been a reversal. Prices in London are falling, while they are flat in East Anglia and the South East, according to the RICS survey. By contrast, property values in the North West, Wales, Northern Ireland and the West Midlands are rising significantly. ""The latest results demonstrate the danger, however tempting, of talking about a single housing market across the country,"" said Mr Rubinsohn. ""RICS indicators, particularly regarding the price trend, are pointing towards an increasingly divergent picture.""

"This video can not be played A woman who called the emergency services 1,868 times is jailed for six months. An abusive caller who rang 999 more than 1,800 times has been jailed. Stacey White, 31, from Nottinghamshire, had ""unleashed a tirade of abuse"" on call handlers since 2011. East Midlands Ambulance Service (EMAS) said her ""inappropriate calls"" had cost the NHS almost Â£31,000 last year. White, who pleaded guilty to persistently making use of a public communications network to cause annoyance, was jailed for 26 weeks at Derbyshire Magistrates Court. In 2014, White, from Kirkby in Ashfield, was given a 20-week suspended prison sentence for misusing the emergency line and physically assaulting a paramedic. EMAS said in one year alone, between March 2016 and April 2017, she had called the service 498 times. Deborah Powell, frequent caller lead for EMAS, said White ""demonstrated flagrant disregard"" for people experiencing life-threatening emergencies. ""Our emergency call handlers are there to provide life-saving advice over the phone and do not expect to be abused when they come to work,"" she said. ""We will continue to prosecute those who misuse our service to ensure that the support is there for those who need it in a real medical emergency."" Simon Tomlinson, general manager for emergency operations centres, said: ""When you call 999 because someone is unconscious, not breathing, having chest pains or has the symptoms of a stroke, you are making the right call.

"This video can not be played King Felipe VI said he respected the UK's decision to leave the EU Britain and Spain can overcome their differences and maintain strong ties after Brexit, the king of Spain has said in a speech at Westminster. King Felipe VI said he believed they could begin ""the necessary dialogue"" to form an arrangement over Gibraltar. But the government of Gibraltar said the king's focus on a dialogue between London and Madrid was ""undemocratic"". The start of a three-day state visit to the UK by the king and queen of Spain ended with a Buckingham Palace banquet. Spanish royals' UK visit glosses over Brexit cracks King Felipe made his comments on Gibraltar in a speech in the Palace of Westminster. King Felipe VI is a distant relative of the Queen While discussing Britain's decision to leave the EU, he said: ""To overcome our differences will be greater in the case of Gibraltar. I am confident through the necessary dialogue and effort, our two governments will be able to work... towards arrangements that are acceptable to all involved."" The government of Gibraltar said it would have to be involved in any discussion between Spain and the UK. It added that two referenda in 1967 and 2002 showed the people of Gibraltar voted to remain British. Chief minister Fabian Picardo QC said: ""We have no desire to part of Spain or to come under Spanish sovereignty in any shape or form. ""In the times in which we live, territories cannot be traded from one monarch to another like pawns in a chess game."" During the speech, King Felipe said Britain and Spain were ""profoundly intertwined"" and he respected the UK's decision to leave the EU. Hundreds of thousands of Britons live in Spain, and a similar number of Spaniards live in the UK, King Felipe told MP and peers. They ""form a sound foundation for our relations,"" he added. ""These citizens have a legitimate expectation of stable living conditions for their families,"" he said. The king highlighted the two countries' important trading arrangements, adding that Britain is ""the second largest investor in our country"". The Spanish royals were guests at a lavish state banquet at Buckingham Palace At the banquet later hosted by the Queen and Prince Philip at Buckingham Palace, the British monarch acknowledged the two countries had not always seen ""eye to eye"". In a speech, she also said: ""A relationship like ours founded on such great strengths and common interests will ensure that both our nations prosper now and in the future whatever challenges arise."" The banquet menu began with poached fillet of salmon trout with fennel. It was followed by a medallion of Scottish beef with bone marrow and truffles, with a sauce made from Madeira, and a dark chocolate and raspberry tart for dessert. The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, Prince Harry, the Prince of Wales, the Duchess of Cornwall, the Princess Royal, the Duke of York and the Earl and Countess of Wessex also attended. The Duke of Edinburgh and the Queen gifted the Spanish monarchs love letters from a mutual relative, Queen Ena of Spain Earlier the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh greeted King Felipe and Queen Letizia at Horse Guards Parade, in a traditional welcoming ceremony. The trip is the first state visit by a Spanish king to the UK since Felipe's father, Juan Carlos, came 31 years ago. The Queen gifted King Felipe copies of love letters from his great-grandmother to King Alfonso XIII. Queen Victoria's grand-daughter Princess Victoria Eugenie met King Alfonso on a state visit to Britain in 1905. The pair married and Princess Victoria Eugenie became Queen Ena of Spain, making King Felipe a descendant of Queen Victoria. The wind died down and the sun broke through the clouds just as the Queen and Duke of Edinburgh stepped on to the dais at Horse Guards. Every visiting head of state gets the same welcome - their national anthem and the chance to inspect the guard of honour with Prince Philip. With his retirement imminent, this could be the last time he performed that particular public duty. King Felipe inspected the guard of honour with Prince Philip, on what is expected to be the prince's last state visit before retiring from public engagements this year Then King Felipe stepped into a carriage with the Queen for the traditional procession down the Mall accompanied by the Household Cavalry. The Duke of Edinburgh and Queen Letizia travelled in a separate carriage. It was a chance for Britain to show off how well it can do ""pomp"". On Thursday, Prince Harry will accompany the royal visitors to Westminster Abbey. King Felipe will lay a wreath at the Grave of the Unknown Warrior and the prince will join them on a short tour of the abbey, including the Tomb of Eleanor ""Leonor"" of Castile - the 13th-Century Spanish princess who married Edward I.

" Sometime after midnight on 14 June 2017, something happens in a flat on the fourth floor of a tower block in west London. It’s flat 16, and a fault occurs in a Hotpoint fridge-freezer. It sparks a deadly chain of events. The blaze spreads quickly through the 24-storey building, and within hours it is reduced to a blackened ruin. In the hours after the blaze starts, dozens of people have to make life or death decisions. To leave or not to leave? This is the story of some of those who were in the fire, told through friends and family who were in touch with them during those desperate hours, and in the words of those who survived. The BBC has pieced together a picture of what happened as the fire took hold - using interviews with survivors, witnesses and relatives of the missing, as well as video footage, gathered on the night and in the immediate aftermath. Every person’s recollection of a traumatic event is unique, and memory can sometimes be unreliable. But what follows are insights into what people in Grenfell Tower faced that night. One month on, facts remain scarce. The authorities say 80 people are dead, or missing and presumed to be dead, but many people have not yet been identified. This story starts at 00:54, when the emergency services are called. By 01:00 firefighters are on the scene.  Tens of people are escaping. I saw the flashing lights outside my window, I saw smoke. I saw sparks and flames up on the sixth to the seventh floor. I looked out my door to see if anyone else had woken up - that’s when I saw no-one else had woken up. Everyone was asleep.” Khalid Suleman Ahmed leaves his flat to knock on neighbours' doors. A poster inside Grenfell Tower advises residents to “stay put” unless a fire is in or directly affecting their flat. “You should be initially safe to stay in your flat keeping the doors and windows closed,” it reads. The fire doors fitted on flats do their job, according to survivors and video footage. They keep clean air in and smoke out of flats unaffected yet by fire. I opened the door, and the smoke was so thick. I tried to leave the flat three times, and each time the smoke was too thick.” A “stay-put” policy assumes that emergency services will, at some point, be able to put out the fire - so residents should shelter in flats until a firefighter rescues them. Fleeing residents would risk running into flames, causing a stampede, or blocking the path of firefighters running up the stairs. Farah Hamdan is at home on the 20th floor with her husband and daughters, including six-month-old baby Leena. Her 999 call is just one of the 600 made that night. Emergency service advice was to stay where she was. Firefighters would come to get her and her family. “We were told to stay put, not go anywhere,” Farah tells her sister on the phone, when she encourages them to leave. She is just one of many people who in the coming hours will have to make a series of life or death decisions. To stay. To run. Seek shelter. Help neighbours. Ring loved ones. To say goodbye. In the first 20 minutes, no-one tweets about the fire. The fire service follows standard policy for a tower block fire, information obtained by the BBC's Newsnight programme shows later. It dispatches four fire engines equipped with standard apparatus for firefighters. There is no high ladder. Firefighters soon believe they are on top of fighting the fridge fire, the BBC investigation learns. In the next 30 minutes, it becomes clear that the Grenfell blaze is no ordinary fire. “The fire’s spreading up, look, wow,” one man shouts, filming the fire on his phone. It’s now 01:19. The exterior is catching fire along the cladding - aluminium panels fitted to improve the block’s insulation and appearance. “The building looked like it was fizzing,” said one resident who got out early. Between people inside the tower and safety is a single set of concrete steps bisecting the building through its core. It is the only fire escape route for a block of hundreds of people. Those on the top three floors are looking at 22, 23, 24 flights of stairs. For the elderly and the sick, negotiating the stairs is almost unthinkable. Hesham Rahman and Mohamed Neda, neighbours on the 23rd floor - the highest residential floor - would normally take one of two lifts in the building. But now they are looking at 48 sets of stairs. That’s about 300 steps. Seven steps, turn, seven steps, turn, seven steps, turn. Over and over again. They are both 57 and not in perfect health. Hesham Rahman Mohamed Neda “On a normal day, it could take 30 minutes to get out of the building,” Andrea Newton, vice-chair of Lancaster West estate residents group said later. But it is not a normal day. The stairwell is filling with acrid smoke from the fire below  - black, thick, poisonous. The stairwell cavity funnels fumes up inside the block. “The smoke was black, and it was so hot, and I couldn't breathe, but I kept going,” Christos Fairbairn said later. Smoke causes choking and asphyxiation, but it also causes nausea and confusion. It was like being in a cave, it was pitch dark, we used a towel to cover our nose, we couldn’t breathe, and we vomited.” Each resident with a health condition such as asthma or heart problems will take longer to get down stairs and be less able to endure the smoke. A firefighter brought a casualty down from the 21st floor, and the guy was unconscious by the 19th. He dragged him down to the 10th, then ran out of air. He took his mask off and pegged it down.” Anyway, the advice from emergency services on the other end of the phone is stay put. Hesham and Mohamed stay on the top floor. But 82-year-old Ali Yawar Jafari tries to make it down. Ali Yawar Jafari He leaves his flat on the 11th floor with his family -  it is just 12 flights to get through. He has a heart condition so he tries to take the lift. He becomes separated from his wife and children, who make it to safety. For those navigating the stairs, smoke makes it hard to see. It stings eyes, it’s dark, it’s hot. “I couldn't see anything. I saw the fire around me. I couldn't talk, I couldn't look around, I couldn't see anything - not even my fingers,” Omar Alhajali, said later, describing the stairwell. For families with children, the stairs may also have seemed too dangerous to risk. I thought I wouldn’t make it down those stairs. My daughter was behind me, she’s all choking. I’m choking, my partner is falling down the stairs. I’m trying to hold her hand while we’re trying to go through the stairs.” Oluwaseun Talabi  lived on the 14th floor. After just four floors, he gave up. Firefighters got him and his family out alive. Nine floors above the Talabi family, Rania Ibrahim is home alone with her two daughters. Hania is three, Fathia is five. Her husband, Hassan, is away in Egypt. Families such as Rania’s in Grenfell face a dilemma - do they lead panicking children down hundreds of steps and risk losing them in the smoke and chaos, or stay put to await the firefighters who say they are coming? Twelve-year-old Jessica Urbano was home alone when the fire broke out. She calls her family from someone else’s phone. Her father, who is standing outside, tells her to leave as fast as she can. “She was out of the flat at 01:30, she was making her way down with some people, and then her phone cut off,” he said later. The phone she is calling from belongs to Brkite Haftom, who is fleeing with her 12-year-old son, Buroke. Perhaps they found each other in the chaos and tried to go down together. The stairwell is not wide. Just over 1m (3ft). And it is filling up. More people lose each other. “From the 16th, we went to the 15th, I looked behind me, she wasn’t there,” 72-year-old Sabah Abdullah said later, describing fleeing with his wife, Khadija Khalloufi. “And I said to myself, 'Oh God, what’s happening there?' I looked up here, there, there. I called her. I called her name.” Khadija Khalloufi Khadija makes it outside, but doesn't survive. People later described squeezing past firefighters running up as they run down. Bodies and debris begin to fill the steps. I could feel myself tripping over in the dark. I was tripping over bodies. On one of the floors I tripped badly and fell, as I looked up I saw the face of a dead man.” At 01:32 a “high” ladder arrives that is capable of reaching the 10th floor. More than 20 fire engines arrive in the next 20 minutes. Inside the tower, people continue to weigh up the dangers of running against the dangers of staying. But not everyone braves the stairwell to go down. Some go up. On the evening of 13 June, Fatima Afrasiabi went to Grenfell Tower to visit her sister. Sakineh, who lived on the 18th floor, had difficulty walking and was visually impaired. Fatima Afrasiabi “After the fire broke out, a friend came to help them get her away from the smoke,” her daughter Nazinin Aghlani said later. “My mum couldn't have got downstairs alone. She could hardly walk.” The friend was one of a family of seven who lived together in the same flat. At some point, firefighters told them to stay inside the flat, but a couple of the family managed to push past and get out. But my mum couldn't have done that.” Together, they decide to bide their time until firefighters reach them. Sakineh Afrasiabi They climb the stairs away from the smoke.By 01:38, 28 more fire engines arrive, but the firefighters are having problems getting up the stairs - their breathing equipment is inadequate to deal with the scale of the fire. “My aunt Fatima was crying for help and for someone to rescue them,” Nazinin said. “My brother was on the phone with them. “She said her goodbyes to him over the phone.” They climb up away from the fire to the 23rd floor to shelter in an area firefighters would never reach. At 01:40, Rania Ibrahim looks out of her 23rd-storey flat. Her flat faces west - below, there are the trees, the estate, and the usual views of other high rises. She is sharing her live video on Facebook. The blue flashing lights, the commotion and the occasional screams on the ground are distant and small. What she can’t see are the flames. An hour after the fire began, it has not yet spread around the whole block. For the next eight minutes, Rania shares a scene of remarkable bravery, as well as growing panic. Rania shared her view from the 23rd floor on social media It is the only footage that has emerged from inside Grenfell Tower that night. A group of people have gathered in her flat, which is smoke-free. “Fathia was friends with Rania, so they must have gone to her flat to be with them when the fire started - maybe they were scared and wanted to be together,” a friend of Ibufras and Esra Ibrahim said later. They have joined Rania and her daughters Hania, three, and Fathia, five, as has Esra’s mother, 72-year-old Fathia Alsanousi. “Don't open the front door. You're going to bring the smoke in, you're not going to be able to breathe,” says Esra Ibrahim to Rania. “I’m scared that maybe there’s someone outside,” Rania replies. “Don’t open it. There’s too much smoke,” she is told. Most of the floors in Grenfell Tower consisted of six flats - four with two bedrooms and two one-bedroom. Police believe about 350 people should have been in the tower block on 14 June, each floor having the potential to house at least 10-20 people. Some of those other residents on the 23rd floor bang loudly on Rania’s flat. Hania and Fathia are behind her, and she knows the hallway outside is filling with deadly fumes. But Rania opens the door. “Hello? Come here, come here,” she says. An elderly man rushes in from the fog-like smoke. It is Hesham Rahman, from the other side of the floor. “Come in, quick, quick,” Rania says. Rania wants to help more people. She thinks they are in the hallway outside. “But [what about] the people outside?” she asks when Ibufras pulls the door shut. “I’m going out there.” She goes back out into the hallway - into the smoke and dark. A mechanical whirring noise is echoing, but there are no audible alarms. “Hello?” she is heard saying. “We are here, we are inside,” someone replies. Reassured, Rania goes back inside and comforts her daughters. “Sit down, sit down,” she urges them. “Maybe there is a rubbish chute?” Esra Ibrahim asks, wondering about other escape routes. “We're stuck on the 23rd floor,” she shouts out of the window. “We’re on the top floor, the top floor hasn’t burned yet.” “You can see the people lucky to have escaped all running down there.” “The police are saying, 'Get out'. How can we?” Rania asks. Next door, sisters Sakineh and Fatima have climbed up from the 18th floor and have made it to Mohamed Neda’s flat. He is injured and has told his family to go without him. His wife, daughter and other relatives make it out with serious injuries. They and two others - women in their 20s - are the only known survivors of the 23rd floor. At 02:00, Mohamed calls his family to say goodbye. His body is later found at the foot of the tower. The top three storeys are the deadliest in the Grenfell fire. Of the 48 people believed to be there on the night, just 14 survive. The building is making loud crunching and crashing sounds. “It’s all the way to the top,” a witness says in mobile phone footage. Firefighters and emergency services begin to tell people to get out, according to family members and survivors. By 02:16 fire chiefs have called in all the extended duration breathing equipment available in London to help crews fight the fire. In the upper half of the building, some people leave their flats, including artist Khadija Saye, who sends a message to a friend. Please pray for me. There's a fire in my council block. I can't leave the flat. Please pray for me and my mum.” Khadija and her mother, Mary Mendy, left the flat together. Firefighters later recover their bodies two floors apart. Genet Shawo and Paulos Patakle, escaping from the 18th floor, wrap wet towels around their two children. They get separated from five-year-old Isaac in the stairwell. Some children remain with their elderly parents. Husna Begum and her brothers are with their mother and father, 87-year-old Kamru Miah and 65-year-old Rebeya Begum, in their flat on the 17th floor. Husna phones brother Mohammed Hakim, who had not been at home when the fire started. I spoke to Husna and the last few words she said were, 'Please forgive me if I've done anything to upset or hurt you. I don't think we're going to make it out of the building.'” He said later: “They were reciting duas from the Koran. Then, it just cut out. I rang Husna, she said, ‘We're not going to make it, we can't make it, we can see flames under the door.’ “I kept saying, ‘Try to put things under the door to stop the smoke coming in. Get as low as you can, and open the windows. Someone's going to come.’ All I could hear was this crackling noise in the background because the phone was still on and she wasn't saying anything.” Omar Belkadi and his wife Farah Hamdan leave their flat on the 20th floor with their three children, baby Leena, eight-year-old Malak, and Tasnim, six. Malak and Tasnim are  discovered by firefighters and pulled alive from the building. Six-month-old Leena was found dead in her mother's arms. She died alongside Omar and Farah, in the stairwell outside their flat. Throughout the night, going from floor to floor, firefighters face impossible choices. “My colleague was going in there and literally having to choose who to save and who to leave and die - you only have two hands and you only take out so many people,” Lucy Masoud, a firefighter, said later. At 03:00, Sawsan Choucair, who is standing outside watching, receives her final call from her family inside - her mother, sister, brother-in-law and their children lived on the 22nd floor. At 03:30, Anthony Disson calls his family to say he is being told to stay in his flat. “Tell my sons I love them,” he says. By 04:30, fire crews are being deployed from all over London in an unprecedented response. The cladding around the whole building is alight. There is fear that the building will collapse Crowds outside are swelling and houses in the surrounding area have been evacuated, as debris has fallen on homes. The scene is terrifying - survivors, relatives, and local residents are watching. Beinazir Lasharie lives next to Grenfell. “By the time I left my flat, the fire was all the way around the building. The material was burning on the outside up,” she says. There was bits of the block, bits of the cladding, falling off the block that was on fire. There were windows exploding. Big massive pieces of debris falling to the floor.” Mobile phones record families dangling ropes made from bedsheets, children screaming. In the chaos, witnesses report that a baby is thrown from a 10th floor, or higher, window. “A man ran forward and caught the baby,” one says. But no-one has come forward to say they caught a baby - or that it was their baby that was caught. At 04:43, the sky begins to turn light as the Sun rises on a fire that would not be extinguished for many more hours. There are no more known calls from the block. Worried friends and family post on social media. Desperate friends and relatives turn to social media At 07:00, Antonio Roncolato is rescued from the 10th floor. At midday, Elpidio Bonifacio, a partially blind pensioner, is rescued from the 11th floor in full view of the world’s media. Firefighters continue to tackle the blaze, which is eventually put out at 01:14 on 15 June, more than 24 hours after it started. In the weeks since the fire, major landmarks are passing for the people missing. Jessica Urbano, who got lost after she left her flat on the 20th floor, turned 13 on 4 July. Her family held a gathering to mark her birthday. Husna Begum, who was 22, was due to get married in early July. On 28 June, an inquest into her death was opened. As of 12 July, 34 victims had been formally identified, but relatives of the many missing fear they will not receive confirmation of their relatives’ deaths or receive a body to bury for months. Maria and Zainu Deen, who lost 32-year-old Zainab and two-year-old Jeremiah, are preparing to wait until at least the end of 2017, when the investigation inside the tower may conclude. “Will Grenfell Tower be their grave?” Maria asks. One month on, for many families, the wait for information continues. Built with Shorthand",Positive,0.99998856
"When a letter arrived bearing official Ministry of Justice markings, Faith Spear knew her time monitoring prisons had come to an end She was the watchdog who was accused of causing ""embarrassment"" by ministers and driven to the depths of despair after voicing concerns about prison monitoring. Then serious rioting erupted at several English prisons. Was Faith Spear right to blow the whistle on the state of England's jails? Her fate was sealed with a printed, rather than handwritten, ministerial signature. Received on a cold morning this January, Faith Spear, the suspended chairman of the Independent Monitoring Board (IMB) at Hollesley Bay in Suffolk, knew what the letter from prisons minister Sam Gyimah would say. She had, he told her, ""repeatedly disclosed classified and other information, often in an inaccurate manner"" and had ""failed to comply with agreed policies and procedures"". Her role as chairman wasterminated and she was told she could not serve on another IMB for at least five years. To this day Mrs Spear believes she was punished by a system more interested in controlling its own reputation than listening to grave concerns over the state of prisons. The spark for the Faith Spear case was an article published byThe Prisons Handbook,externalin April 2016 entitled ""Whistle-blower without a whistle"". Using the pseudonym ""Daisy Mallett"", Mrs Spear challenged the idea that monitoring boards were truly independent. ""I want to speak out,"" said Mrs Spear in the article, which named neither individuals nor her own prison. ""I am here as the public's eyes and ears, that is my role, but my voice is silenced. ""Prisons today are starved of resources. When I make the prison aware of issues with prisoners I am made to feel like I'm an irritation to them, but I am not here to irritate the prison process."" The repercussions were immediate. A letter was fired off from the HQ of the Independent Monitoring Boards Secretariat - housed in the Ministry of Justice London HQ - to every IMB member in the country. In it, president John Thornhill alleged Daisy Mallett's article contained ""inaccuracies and misunderstandings"". He warned the Justice Secretary (then Michael Gove) had been alerted and ""legal advice"" sought. In less than a year, Mrs Spear would be unmasked, suspended, involved in various hearings and ultimately sacked from her voluntary role as an IMB chairman. Her experience echoes that of Ray Bewry, who to this day is the only former prisoner (his conviction was eventually quashed) to have served on an IMB. ""Any effective IMB member cannot do their job,"" claims Mr Bewry who served for a decade on the IMB at HMP Norwich. ""They want them to do what they are told, and not rock the boat."" At no stage did Mrs Spear seek to deny being Daisy Mallett Having revealed she had three years of service and a degree in criminology, the outing of Daisy Mallett was perhaps inevitable. Sure enough, within days of publication Mrs Spear, a mother of three, was called at home by then vice chairman Christine Smart asking her if she was behind the article. Mrs Spear confirmed that she was. And at the April 2016 meeting of her IMB board, Mrs Spear was made to read out a statement confessing to being the author of the offending article. She was then expected to resign. ""It had already been planned as to how it was going be,"" she said. ""I was ambushed."" ""Faith just walked on to a minefield,"" says Mr Leech, the Thailand-based founder and editor of The Prisons Handbook. ""She should have refused to answer any questions and just move on with her business as chairman."" Perhaps. But hindsight is a beautiful thing. Faith Spear is a known regular at Justice Committee meetings in Parliament ""I read my statement then had 50 minutes of every member questioning me, bullying me, taunting me. It was one of the worst experiences I have endured,"" Mrs Spear says. Sent outside for 40 minutes, she was then told her board had unanimously decreed she should ""step down as chairman"". ""If I did not, there was an ultimatum,"" she said. ""They would not work with me."" So what caused such a revolt? Mr Leech believes the most likely trigger was that Mrs Spear ""criticised the recruitment process"". This, he said, was tantamount to suggesting some IMB members were not up to the job. Ray Bewry is the only former prisoner to have served on an IMB The IMB Secretariat told the BBC it encourages members ""to engage in the national debate on prison standards"" though it cautioned ""this must be a way that does not compromise their independence and draws upon evidence and experience"". The secretariat would not comment on the ""specifics"" of Mrs Spear's case, saying ""any questions on the termination of an IMB member should be directed to the MoJ press office as these are ministerial appointments"". Something else happened while Mrs Spear was absent from the boardroom. Nomination forms were created for her successor and a new vice chairman. Mrs Spear only learned of this because a fellow member broke ranks and sent a chain of emails to her. One, from Mrs Spear's predecessor Dr David Smith to the then vice chairman Christine Smart, concerned ""nominees for board positions"". In it, he wrote: ""A delicate one, that was devised in the hope or expectation that Faith would resign. ""She has not and if she became aware that nominations had been requested, it would add fuel to the fire. ""I suppose we could always tear up the nomination forms and pretend it never happened."" Mr Leech, who was also sent copies of the leaked emails, said: ""What we had here were people saying 'we will just rip it up and pretend it never happened'."" Joseph Spear told how his wife ceased eating properly after the board meeting revolt The BBC approached Dr Smith and Mrs Smart about both the attempt to get Mrs Spear to stand down and the leaked emails. Dr Smith declined to explain what he intended by his emails to fellow board members. However, he said an investigation into the matter had concluded that those ""complained about had no case to answer as the allegations against them had not been substantiated"". Mrs Smart too said the matter had been ""independently investigated and reported to the minister and a decision taken"" adding: ""I have nothing further to add."" The Ministry of Justice was asked whether the nomination forms were a contravention of IMB rules and whether it felt Mrs Spear's allegations of bullying behaviour against fellow IMB members had been properly investigated. Neither question was answered. Both Mrs Smart and Dr Smith subsequently resigned from the IMB of Hollesley Bay. For weeks after that fateful meeting in April, Mrs Spear continued to carry out prison visits at Hollesley Bay. And at the May 2016 board meeting, she found herself sitting alone. ""Faith wasn't eating properly,"" says Mrs Spear's husband of 30 years, Joseph. ""There have been some real lows. Seeing the physical and mental impact on Faith in front of me was remarkable."" During this time, she spoke about her experience to theEast Anglian Daily Times (EADT),external. In June, she found she had been suspended. A letter from previous prisons minister Andrew Selous cited the EADT article - and not the Prisons Handbook piece - as grounds for the suspension . A few months after Mrs Spear was suspended, her worst fears about prisons were realised with a string of riots including at Bedford , Birmingham and Swaleside in Kent The letter told her she was accused of ""failing to treat colleagues with respect"" and for ""acting in a manner which could bring discredit or cause embarrassment to the IMB"". ""It was just astonishing what people had engineered against her,"" says Mr Spear. ""I have seen her rebound and find her feet and a place to rearticulate the issues she was concerned about."" Independent Monitoring Boards are ""part of the UK's obligations to the United Nations for independent monitoring of prisons"", says Mr Leech. ""IMBs need to be fit for purpose. They are not. They are groomed to be quiet."" The Ministry of Justice said: ""We value the work of Independent Monitoring Boards which play a vital role in ensuring prisons are places of safety and reform."" A few months after Mrs Spear was suspended, her worst fears were realised with a string of prison riots at places such asBedford,Birmingham,LewesandSwaleside in Kent. At Bedford,Â£1m of damagewas caused while in Birmingham stairwells were set alight and paper records destroyed during trouble on four wings of the category B prison. The IMB Secretariat issued a statement on the riots. Its irony was not lost on Mrs Spear. In it, Mr Thornhill claimed: ""IMB members have regularly expressed great frustration that their real concerns about the state of prisons has been largely ignored over the years."" He spoke of ""serious issues"" and ""staff shortages"", words not too far removed from Mrs Spear's own warnings that prisons were being ""starved of resources"". And then, in January, she was sacked as IMB chairman. ""The crisis in our prisons has never been as bad as it is now,"" says Mr Leech. ""In the case of the Faith, they shot the messenger and they did not read the message.""

"Schooners typically have two or three masts with multiple sails Madagascar's master shipbuilders can all trace their skills back to just one family who arrived on the African island more than 150 years ago, writes Tim Healy in the capital, Antananarivo. In the 19th Century, schooners were a familiar sight along France's northern coast, their majestic sails fluttering in the wind. Nowadays, they have been replaced by boats which are far faster, more efficient - and less romantic. But there is still a corner of the world where a new generation of carpenters is keeping old maritime traditions alive by crafting these vessels to original standards. The mastery shown by carpenters working in the town of Belo-sur-mer on Madagascar's west coast is respected around the world - at least one of their beautifully crafted schooners has been sent to collectors in France in recent years. And it is all thanks to one family, brought to the island by a king's ambition. Malagasy schooners require regular maintenance It was King Radama II of Madagascar who decided to bring the schooner to his East African island. For more than a thousand years, Arab boats moved along the coast of Madagascar trading goods for slaves. They were joined in the 17th Century by European trading vessels. Until the 19th Century, the Malagasy fleet was composed of mainly smaller fishing boats and canoes. But the Vezo Sakalava - coastal people from the western region - wanted to develop bigger trading boats to move cargo around the island, and King Radama was happy to grant their wish. The king turned to the French government, asking them to send shipwrights to teach his people. The Justins, a father-and-son team of carpenters, set to work restoring one of their schooners Soon, the Joachim family, who were creoles of mixed European and African descent, and fellow marine carpenters from France's neighbouring island of La Reunion were sailing to Madagascar. But when the family arrived, they discovered that the king had been assassinated. His reign had lasted less than two years, from 1861 to 1863. The Joachims soon found themselves forced to flee to the east coast and, over the course of several decades, the family circumnavigated and lived in parts of southern Madagascar, eventually settling in the western port of Morondava. It was here, and in nearby Belo-sur-mer, that Enasse Joachim and his three sons began practicing their craft, building schooners for Madagascar. Of Dutch origin, the ships can have two or three masts decorated with several sails, and reach up to 22m (72ft) in length. As the vessel does not have a keel, it is ideal for navigating shallow Malagasy lagoons and mooring on sandbanks and beaches. The tradition of building ships runs through families By 1904 - some 40 years after they first stepped foot on Madagascar - some of the Joachim family had managed to establish shipbuilding schools. It was done with the approval of France's Governor Gallieni, since the French had colonised Madagascar almost a decade earlier, in 1895. The Malagasy apprentices of the Joachims became master carpenters and shipbuilders in their own right and passed down their skills through several generations, turning Belo-sur-mer into a major shipyard for Schooners, or Botsy in Malagasy. More than a century later, their legacy continues in Belo-sur-mer, carried on by families like the Justins, who have built two ships. ""My sons and I come from a long line of shipbuilders going back to my great-grandparents,"" says the patriarch, known simply as Mr Justin. Traders have used boats to ferry cargo around Madagascar for centuries The name of one of their boats, Fagnanarantsoandraza, translates from poetic Malagasy to ""let it be known that the fine have no need to stay here"". It is a name worthy of the love put into building the boat, constructed with timber painstakingly collected from nearby forests. The vessel, launched in 2012, is 18m in length and can carry loads of up to 50 tonnes, usually salt or agricultural products, to areas that are often inaccessible by road. The ships are summoned home for regular maintenance, including the resealing of their hulls, before returning to sea. Of the three Joachim sons, Albert's influence is perhaps most felt today. The Malagasy diminutive of Albert is Bebe, and the port in Morondava bears this name. While descendants of Albert and Fernand Joachim are believed to live on in Morondava, less was known about their brother, Ludovic, until recently. He had married a woman 54km (34 miles) away in the village Belo-sur-mer, where he died in 1902. A century later in 2002, a French woman living locally was determined to locate Ludovic's grave and managed to do so with the help of the mayor, and village elders. Discovered 400m from the village where it was hidden by undergrowth, the modest grave was marked out with a mound of rocks and a fading wooden cross etched with his name. Local authorities decided to restore the grave and mounted a miniature wooden schooner upon the tomb, to honour the Joachim family's unique contribution to the island's seafaring traditions. One of the original shipbuilders, Ludovic Emmanuel Joachim, died in Belo-sur-mer in 1902 Giant croc had teeth like a T. rex How could a shipwreck disappear? Would you risk jail for a cup of tea?

"Overwatch League teams will each be based in a different city Could Overwatch be the game to take e-sports mainstream? Its developer Activision Blizzard has just announced the first seven team owners for a forthcoming league. It believes, in time, the tournament could prove more lucrative than the UK's Premier League - football's highest-earning competition. Several of the successful bidders have made their mark with traditional sports teams, and the buy-in price has not been cheap. The BBC understands the rights cost $20m (Â£15.5m) per squad. For that, owners get the promise of a 50% revenue split with the Overwatch League itself for future earnings. The fast-paced cartoon-like shooter was designed to appeal to both players and spectators. It's low on gore and features a racial mix of male and female heroes, including a gay character - a relative rarity in gaming. Players get a first-person view of proceedings but spectators will be shown third-person views Unlike most e-sports competitions, each team will be based in a different major city to help owners attract home crowds. And they will pursue the world's biggest consumer brands as sponsors, rather than the kind of games-related businesses usually associated with e-sports. ""If you want to reach 18-to-35-year-olds, you really need to be where they are, and they are playing games,"" Activision Blizzard's chief executive Bobby Kotick told the BBC. ""The other thing that we offer uniquely is that Overwatch is a very family-friendly game experience. It's a teen-rated game; it's super-colourful, super-friendly. ""And if you look at the geographical diversity of the maps or the ethnic and racial diversity of the characters, those are all things that we took into consideration in the construction of what we thought would be a globally appealing experience."" Overwatch battles take place in 19 locations across the globe including Egypt and Iraq To start with, teams are expected to make use of existing venues, but in time Activision Blizzard believes owners will build huge dedicated stadiums of their own. Fixtures will also be streamed online, and be made accessible from within the game itself. Overwatch seeks e-sports domination Overwatch player quits after racist rant Overwatch cheat-maker told to pay $8.6m The first-person shooter features about two dozen characters who engage in team-based battles set across a near-future Earth. Each character has a distinct personality - including a genetically engineered scientist ape, a cowboy-styled bounty hunter and a nerdy-looking climatologist - and unique abilities. The heroes divide into four broad categories: offence- fast-moving characters that can inflict a lot of damage quickly defence- warriors best suited to guarding key parts of the battlefield and repelling attacks tank- fighters that can sustain a lot of damage and are therefore well-suited to leading attacks support- champions that help other players heal and access their most powerful attack modes more quickly than normal Squads of six characters are pitched against each other in a range of challenges, including protecting/capturing a location; defending/destroying a vehicle as it is driven across a zone; and being first to wipe out the enemy team. Overwatch launched more than a year ago. Numerous awards and a thriving community of about 30 million players prove it has appeal. Even so, the new league is not guaranteed to succeed on the scale Activision Blizzard hopes. Critics suggest some potential investors have been put off by a demand that the firm gets areported 25% cut,externalof any team sale. Overwatch competitions have already drawn large crowds And there is concern that ticket and sponsorship sales could be hit by plans to launch a similar venture based on its Call of Duty titles. Moreover, existing e-sports competitions have yet to collectively makemore than Â£1bn a year,external- by contrast Premier League clubs jointly earned Â£3.6bn in the 2015-16 season,according to a recent study,external. ""I think it's a bunch of rubbish that it will approach anything like pro-sports revenues,"" commented Lewis Ward from the consultancy IDC. ""The size of the gamer base, demand for video content and all the rest will drive its sponsorship deals. ""But the second-biggest e-sport at present [in terms of prize money] - League of Legends - only sold its global media broadcast rights in December for $50m [Â£38.9m] a year through to 2023, which is the biggest deal of its kind as far as I am aware. ""So, I think the people who are investing tens of millions to buy an Overwatch team are likely to lose money."" To help make the league a less risky investment, Activision Blizzard has opted not to relegate or promote teams at the end of each season. The Overwatch League's first games are set to be played later this year Players will also need to sign full-time contracts, and in return be guaranteed a baseline wage and other benefits. Robert Kraft - billionaire chief executive of the Kraft Group, which owns the New England Patriots American football team and the New England Revolution soccer club. Jeff Wilpon - chief operating officer of the New York Mets baseball team and vice-president of the property investment firm Sterling Equities, which operates the Mets' home stadium. Andy Miller - chairman of NRG eSports, which already maintains an Overwatch team, and co-owner of the Sacramento Kings basketball team. Mr Miller was previously vice-president of mobile advertising at Apple. Ben Spoont - chief executive of Misfits Gaming, an e-sports organisation formed last year, with teams competing in Overwatch among other games. The National Basketball Association's Miami Heats owns part of the business and shares its team colours with the gamers. Noah Whinston - chief executive of Immortals, a multi-game e-sports organisation that already has an Overwatch squad. Kevin Chou - chief executive of a new venture, KSV eSports. He was previously chief executive of the mobile games publisher Kabam. NetEase - a Chinese tech company, which publishes several Blizzard titles, including World of Warcraft, in mainland China as well as distributing its own games. The firm also operates social media, email and e-commerce businesses in the country. Talent-spotters will monitor smaller third-party Overwatch competitions to identify new talent. Activision Blizzard acknowledges that existing squads tend to be male-dominated, but has ""zero desire"" to set up a separate female league or enforce a form of ""positive discrimination"" to address this. The Overwatch League plans to announce teams in Europe, Latin America, Canada, Australia and New Zealand soon ""Right now most of the pro players are male,"" Nate Nanzer, the league's commissioner, acknowledged. ""But there's no reason that women cannot play Overwatch at the same level as men, and our intention is absolutely to have the two genders mixed. ""The demographics of people who play video games in the year 2017 tend to be more male than female... but I think that's changing and it's much more commonplace for young girls today to play video games right alongside their brothers."" He added that some competitions his firm had hosted in South Korea had attracted more women than men to their audiences, suggesting the current gender imbalance need not limit interest. Harrison Pond, professional Overwatch player for eUnited ""I'm still quite young - 20 years old - and I had been concentrating on my studies, but dropped all that when Overwatch came out. ""I was in top teams from pretty much the beginning. ""Until recently, we practised seven days a week and up to eight hours a day. But we've toned it down a bit if there's not a tournament coming up. ""It's like a normal job to me. ""There's a lot of depth to the game that new players might not understand, like making sure you use your Ultimates [special powers] at the correct time instead of wasting them. ""It also appeals to more people than e-sports games like Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, which involves playing as terrorists - some people have problems with that. ""About 96% of my YouTube subscribers are Korean and they are amazing fans. They want photos and bring you gifts. ""I think we will eventually see a similar reaction in the West, but I think it will take a long time to get to Korea's level. ""I'm excited by the new league - it seems they want to shift e-sports into a new era, shaping it into something more professional like the NFL. ""I also like the idea of being an employee with job security and the possibility of funding for college when your career ends. ""I have faith that Activision Blizzard will pull this off but I understand the scepticism from other people based on how it has handled e-sports in the past."" Another issue the league will inevitably have to face is the influence it has over young minds. Parents might be more relaxed about their children watching a traditional sport that spurs them on to exercise afterwards than one that encourages even more screen time. Activision Blizzard says more than 30 million people already play Overwatch But the league's creators still believe their ""athletes"" can act as role models. ""Our players generally need to be well conditioned and they need to be physically fit,"" said Mr Kotick. ""A big part of the mental acuity that they have comes from their training regimens, their diet, their exercise. ""It's not the same as having the same physical requirements that you might see in football or basketball. But our players take care of themselves.""

"Mother Teresa wore a simple white sari with three blue stripes on the border For nearly half a century, Mother Teresa, the Roman Catholic nun who worked with the poor in the Indian city of Kolkata (Calcutta) wore a simple white sari with three blue stripes on the borders, one thicker than the rest. Senior nuns who work for Missionaries of Charity, a 67-year-old sisterhood which has more than 3,000 nuns worldwide, continue to wear what has now become the religious uniform of this global order. On Monday, news washed up that this ""famous"" sari of the Nobel laureate nun, who died in 1997,has been trademarked,externalto prevent ""unfair"" use by people for commercial purposes. India's government quietly recognised the sari as the intellectual property of the Missionaries of Charity in September last year, when thenun was declared a saint by the Vatican, but the order had decided not to make it public. Biswajit Sarkar, a Kolkata-based lawyer who works pro-bono for the order, says he had applied for the trademark in 2013. ""It just came to my mind that the colour-identified blue border of the sari had to be protected to prevent any future misuse for commercial purposes,"" he told me. ""If you want to wear or use the colour pattern in any form, you can write to us and if we are convinced that there is no commercial motive, we will allow it."" What happened to Mother Teresa's sceptics? Who was Mother Teresa? How to put on a sari The austere blue-trimmed white sari has long been identified with the nun and her order. The story goes that in 1948, the Albanian nun, with permission from Rome, began wearing it and a small cross across her shoulder. According to some accounts, the nun chose the blue border as it was associated with purity. For more than three decades, thesaris have been woven by leprosy patients,externalliving in a home run by the order on the outskirts of Kolkata. Nuns say Mother Teresa had issued orders before her death that her name ""should not be exploited for commercial purposes"". The austere blue-trimmed white sari has long been identified with the nun and her order Accordingly, Mr Sarkar helped the order to trademark her name two decades back. Still, nuns of the order have complained that Mother Teresa's name was being exploited for commercial gain: a school being run in her name in Nepal where teachers complained of not receiving salaries; a priest raising funds in Romania using the order's name; shops near the order's headquarters in Kolkata telling customers that proceeds from memorabilia sales were donated to the order; and a cooperative bank in India curiously named after the nun. ""So we decided to do something about it,"" says Mr Sarkar. ""Through this we are trying to tell the world that her name and reputation should not be misused."" Owning a trademark on a colour can be a tricky business. In 2013 Nestle won a court battle against confectionery rival Cadbury,over the latter's attempt to trademark the purple colour- known as Pantone 2865c - of its Dairy Milk bars. It is also not clear how this trademark on the famous blue striped sari will be enforced. Many online shopping sites already sell variations of ""unisex Mother Teresa dress"" - blue bordered sari, and a long sleeved blouse. Also, the move is bound to raise the hackles of the nun's critics - and she has her fair share of them - who have accused her of glorifying poverty, hobnobbing with dictators, running shambolic care facilities and proselytising. ""How can anybody appropriate a sari, which has been a traditional Indian dress,"" one of them asked me, preferring to remain unnamed. Designers like Anand Bhushan differ. ""Some designs of the traditional Indian towel called gamcha, for example, have been trademarked. There's nothing wrong in trademarking a distinctive and iconic design or pattern like Mother Teresa's sari. It's not like anybody is beginning to own the sari.""

"Vicki McNelly said a hospital sonogram revealed her baby had died in the womb A grieving mother has warned pregnant women not to use a home foetal listening device that gave her ""false reassurance"" her unborn baby was alive. Vicki McNelly, 29, thought she heard the baby moving when she used the Doppler kit but her daughter was stillborn the following day. Manufacturers say the kits are safe and should not be linked to stillbirths. Experts who have been ""specially trained"" regularly use the monitors but discourage the use of them at home. Mrs McNelly, from Mortimer near Reading, is calling for the Doppler devices to be banned. She had used the kit - which can be bought over-the-counter from about Â£25 - in June 2015 to help her husband bond with their baby. However, after waking and ""feeling something was wrong"" in the middle of the night, she used it to check for a heartbeat and movement. Vicki McNelly and her husband Stephen were able to cradle the baby after she was stillborn ""Because I heard something, I convinced myself I must be okay and that everything would be fine,"" she said. ""If the Doppler wasn't in the house I would have only been able to rely on my own instincts. I think the Doppler gave me a false sense of security."" Mrs McNelly said a hospital sonogram revealed her child, who she had named Evie, had died in the womb. Dr Alison Wright, Vice President of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, said she ""strongly discourages"" the use of Dopplers at home. ""These devices can cause huge anxiety among pregnant women if they are not able to hear their baby's heartbeat and therefore understandably worry until they can see their doctor or midwife,"" she said. ""Also, potentially, women may be falsely reassured as hearing a heartbeat is not necessarily an indication that it is well with the baby. ""Unlike doctors and midwives who are specially trained to use foetal heart monitors, women who use Dopplers themselves may easily mistake their own heartbeat for their baby's."" Mrs McNelly has now joined stillbirth charity Kicks Count to call for the devices to be banned - with a petition reaching more than 11,000 signatures. CEO of Kicks Count, Elizabeth Hudson, said Dopplers ""create a barrier between the mum and seeking medical help"". She said many brands were marketed to expectant mothers, but should only be used by trained professionals such as midwives and doctors. ""Women are using Dopplers and being reassured by them, and unfortunately that leads to missed opportunities to save babies who may be in distress,"" Ms Hudson added. The BBC contacted several Doppler manufacturers, which said their devices should not be used as a substitute for professional medical care.

"On 29 March Theresa May sent a six-page letter notifying the EU of the UK's intention to leave. The Article 50 letter contained a clause little discussed at the time - notifying the EU of the UK's withdrawal from the European Atomic Energy Community, also known as Euratom. But this previously obscure section has now been put under the political spotlight, with some MPs, including a number of Conservatives, gearing up for a fight on the subject. One prominent Leave campaigner has even said the UK should stay in Euratom after Brexit. On Thursday, the government will clarify its stance on the issue in a position paper. But what is Euratom and why does it matter? Euratom regulates the nuclear industry across Europe, safeguarding the transport of nuclear materials, disposing of waste, and carrying out research. It was set up in 1957 alongside the European Economic Community (EEC), which eventually morphed into the EU. The 1957 treaty established a ""nuclear common market"" to enable the free movement of nuclear workers and materials between member states. A nuclear reactor under construction in northern France The UK joined Euratom when it joined the EEC in 1973. It is a separate legal entity from the EU, but is tied up with its laws and institutions, and subject to the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice (ECJ). No country is a full member of Euratom without being a member of the EU. When EU countries transport nuclear materials or trade them with other countries, Euratom sets the rules. The body also co-ordinates research projects across borders. For example the Culham Centre for Fusion Energy, a laboratory near Oxford, is largely funded by the EU and many of its scientists are EU nationals. The Culham Centre for Fusion Energy Euratom also reports to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). If the UK were to leave Euratom it would need to come to a new arrangement with the IAEA. There are two main arguments why Brexit should involve quitting Euratom. Firstly, staying in would raise lots of tricky legal questions. For example, the Euratom treaty states that it applies only on the territory of EU member states. Legal opinion is divided on whether a country could leave the EU and retain Euratom membership, according to research by the House of Commons library. But the UK government has made up its mind. ""The triggering of Article 50 on Euratom is not because we have a fundamental critique of the way that it works. It was because it was a concomitant decision that was required in triggering Article 50,"" said Brexit Secretary David Davis. The second reason for quitting Euratom is the government's interpretation of the Brexit result. Vote Leave campaigned to restore British sovereignty and ""take back control"" by ending the supremacy of EU law over domestic law. In her speech to the Conservative Party conference in October, Theresa May made this rather more specific, pledging to ensure ""the authority of EU law in this country ended forever"". This stance has been called the ""ECJ red line"" - in other words stopping the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg having any authority in the UK. October 2016: Theresa May promises to end ""the authority of EU law in this country"" The nuclear agreement is underpinned by the ECJ. That means if states signed up to the Euratom treaty breach its terms, they can be hauled before European judges. This could happen to Britain after Brexit, if it remains signed up to Euratom. Full membership would apparently be incompatible with a strict interpretation of the ECJ red line. Also, the Euratom treaty requires members to allow the free movement of nuclear scientists, which could fall foul of the government's wish to cut net migration drastically from its current level. Dominic Cummings, who was campaign director of Vote Leave, this week criticised what he called ""government morons"" who want to withdraw from Euratom. ""Tory Party keeps making huge misjudgements re what the REF was about. EURATOM was different treaties, ECJ role no signif problem,"" he said on Twitter. Although the agreement is overseen by the ECJ, the court does not intervene very often, according to those who want to stay in. Conservative MP Ed Vaizey and Labour MP Rachel Reeves publishedan article in the Sunday Telegraph,externalthis week defending Euratom membership. ""There appears never to have been an ECJ case involving the UK and Euratom,"" they said. ""Whatever people were voting for last June, it certainly wasn't to junk 60 years of co-operation in this area with our friends and allies."" James Chapman, a former special adviser to David Davis, has also criticised the application of the ""ECJ red line"" to Euratom: ""I would have thought the UK would like to continue welcoming nuclear scientists who are all probably being paid six figures and are paying lots of tax,""he told the BBC last month. ""But we're withdrawing from it because of this absolutist position on the European court. I think she [the prime minister] could show some flexibility in that area."" Mr Vaizey and Ms Reeves also raised the issue of cancer medication. Euratom supports the ""secure and safe supply and use of medical radioisotopes"". Radioactive isotopes are essential for various types of cancer treatment but cannot be stockpiled because they decay quickly. In the UK they are imported, often from Belgium and the Netherlands. Some experts worry that leaving the treaty will delay the delivery of drugs to patients who need them. Global demand for isotopes is rising rapidly, and many of the reactors that produce them are getting old. Radioactive isotopes used to treat cancer The government's answer to this is that medical isotopes are not fissile nuclear material - that is, capable of reacting - so they are not subject to international nuclear safeguards. According to Science Minister Jo Johnson, their availability ""should not be impacted by the UK's exit from Euratom"". In February, Parliament passed a bill giving the government permission to trigger Article 50. Labour MPs tried to add an amendment keeping the UK in Euratom, but it was comfortably voted down. Last month Theresa May's Conservatives lost their majority in the general election, which has emboldened opponents to the government's Brexit stance. Though the government's position has been firmed up by signing a confidence-and-supply deal with the DUP, it can still lose key votes if just seven Conservatives vote the other way. Several of Ed Vaizey's colleagues have backed his position on Euratom. Given the Labour manifesto pledge to ""retain access"" to the nuclear agency, this means the government could well lose a vote on the issue. Given that Euratom was explicitly mentioned in the Article 50 letter, any reversal of withdrawal would be difficult, and an act of Parliament would probably not be enough. Changing or reversing the UK's withdrawal from Euratom would probably need to be done formally by the government. If that were to happen, it would raise another contentious legal question - whether the notification of withdrawal from the EUcan be amended or revoked. The government really does not want to open that can of worms. What's more, staying in the nuclear agreement would not be a matter purely for the UK to decide. The EU,which has published a position paper,externalon Britain's departure from Euratom, would also have to agree. That could make things complicated. Various options have been mooted for an alternative to full Euratom membership. Switzerland, not an EU member, has a special status as an equal partner as an ""associated country"". This could be an option explored by the UK. But sticking to the ECJ red line might make that path difficult. Beznau nuclear power plant in Switzerland - the country is a partner with Euratom Euratom also has looser co-operation agreements with other countries such as the US and Australia. These third-party countries help fund projects such as the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor in France, which is run by Euratom. But moving to a looser agreement could cause disruption when the UK is so integrated into the EU's nuclear energy market. Given the long timescale needed for nuclear projects, scientists worry about the uncertainty. The final arrangements between the UK and Euratom after Brexit will have big repercussions for a country which is committed to atomic energy for the long term - unlike Germany, which ditched nuclear power in the wake of the 2011 Fukushima disaster. Last September the governmentapproved a new Â£18bn power station, financed by the French and Chinese governments, at Hinkley Point in Somerset. Hinkley Point in Somerset is to be the site of a new nuclear power station Sellafield, where plutonium is reprocessed and stored, is Europe's largest nuclear facility. The Cumbria site has the largest stockpile of civil plutonium in the world. Euratom runs the on-site laboratory there, and also spends a big chunk of its EU-wide resources running safeguard checks there. There's also the centre at Culham, where Euratom plays a big role. In May the Commons Energy Committee, which has been investigating the impact of Brexit on energy policy,urged the UK to delay leaving Europe's nuclear regulator. Power supplies could be threatened if a new regulator was not ready, it said. Whatever decision is finally made on Euratom, it will matter for decades to come.

"A government refusal to publish a report on the funding of UK Islamist extremist groups has been criticised. The home secretaryhas issued a two-page summary,externalwhich concluded most organisations were funded via small, anonymous British-based donations. Amber Rudd said she had decided to do so for national security reasons. Opposition parties claimed the internal review was being ""suppressed"" to protect Saudi Arabia which has been accused of being a source of funding. The Home Office has been under pressure for months to publish its investigation into the ""nature, scale and origin of the funding"". Ms Rudd said another reason for not making the report public was because of the personal information it contained. Some MPs will be allowed to view the report in private but without revealing its contents. The summary of the report concluded that most extremist organisations got their money, often hundreds of thousands of pounds, from individual donors in the UK. But it also confirmed that a small minority did get significant funds from overseas. These, it said, taught ""deeply conservative forms of Islam"" to individuals who became ""of extremist concern"". From now on, charities will have to declare any overseas funding to the Charity Commission. The summary said: ""The most common source of support for Islamist extremist organisations in the UK is from small, anonymous public donations, with the majority of these donations most likely coming from UK-based individuals. ""In some cases these organisations receive hundreds of thousands of pounds a year."" It added: ""For a small number of organisations with which there are extremism concerns, overseas funding is a significant source of income. ""However, for the vast majority of extremist groups in the UK, overseas funding is not a significant source. Overseas support has allowed individuals to study at institutions that teach deeply conservative forms of Islam and provide highly socially conservative literature and preachers to the UK's Islamic institutions. ""Some of these individuals have since become of extremist concern."" The government's refusal to publish the full report angered opposition parties which accused ministers of trying to protect allies such as Saudi Arabia which has long been accused of being a source of extremist funding, something it has long denied. Green Party co-leader Caroline Lucas was among those critical of the government's move The Green Party co-leader Caroline Lucas said there was a deep complicity between Whitehall and Riyadh. She said: ""The statement gives absolutely no clue as to which countries foreign funding for extremism originates from - leaving the government open to further allegations of refusing to expose the role of Saudi Arabian money in terrorism in the UK."" The Lib Dem leader, Tim Farron, said the government was putting its friendship with Saudi Arabia ahead of its values. He said: ""What we want to know is who are the violent extremists and who are their funders. ""This report clearly has found some of that out and we're bound to start suspecting all the more now that the sources of funding must be from the likes of Saudi Arabia, Qatar, otherwise the government wouldn't be so embarrassed that they won't tell us the truth."" Shadow home secretary Diane Abbott, said: ""There is a strong suspicion this report is being suppressed to protect this government's trade and diplomatic priorities, including in relation to Saudi Arabia. The only way to allay those suspicions is to publish the report in full."" The Home Office insisted diplomatic relations played no part in the decision not to make the full report public. In ablog published on its website,external, the Home Office said: ""The former prime minister [David Cameron] was clear when committing to the review in the House that it would report to the home Secretary and prime minister. No commitment was made to publish the review... Contrary to suggestions by some media outlets, diplomatic relations played absolutely no part in the decision not to publish the full report."" The home secretary said: ""This government is committed to stamping out extremism in all its forms and cutting off the funding that fuels it. ""The Commission for Counter-Extremism, which the prime minister announced earlier this year, will have a key role to play in this fight. ""We are determined to cut off all funding that fuels the evils of extremism and terrorism, and will work closely with international and domestic partners to tackle this threat.""

"This video can not be played King Felipe VI said he respected the UK's decision to leave the EU Britain and Spain can overcome their differences and maintain strong ties after Brexit, the king of Spain has said in a speech at Westminster. King Felipe VI said he believed they could begin ""the necessary dialogue"" to form an arrangement over Gibraltar. But the government of Gibraltar said the king's focus on a dialogue between London and Madrid was ""undemocratic"". The start of a three-day state visit to the UK by the king and queen of Spain ended with a Buckingham Palace banquet. Spanish royals' UK visit glosses over Brexit cracks King Felipe made his comments on Gibraltar in a speech in the Palace of Westminster. King Felipe VI is a distant relative of the Queen While discussing Britain's decision to leave the EU, he said: ""To overcome our differences will be greater in the case of Gibraltar. I am confident through the necessary dialogue and effort, our two governments will be able to work... towards arrangements that are acceptable to all involved."" The government of Gibraltar said it would have to be involved in any discussion between Spain and the UK. It added that two referenda in 1967 and 2002 showed the people of Gibraltar voted to remain British. Chief minister Fabian Picardo QC said: ""We have no desire to part of Spain or to come under Spanish sovereignty in any shape or form. ""In the times in which we live, territories cannot be traded from one monarch to another like pawns in a chess game."" During the speech, King Felipe said Britain and Spain were ""profoundly intertwined"" and he respected the UK's decision to leave the EU. Hundreds of thousands of Britons live in Spain, and a similar number of Spaniards live in the UK, King Felipe told MP and peers. They ""form a sound foundation for our relations,"" he added. ""These citizens have a legitimate expectation of stable living conditions for their families,"" he said. The king highlighted the two countries' important trading arrangements, adding that Britain is ""the second largest investor in our country"". The Spanish royals were guests at a lavish state banquet at Buckingham Palace At the banquet later hosted by the Queen and Prince Philip at Buckingham Palace, the British monarch acknowledged the two countries had not always seen ""eye to eye"". In a speech, she also said: ""A relationship like ours founded on such great strengths and common interests will ensure that both our nations prosper now and in the future whatever challenges arise."" The banquet menu began with poached fillet of salmon trout with fennel. It was followed by a medallion of Scottish beef with bone marrow and truffles, with a sauce made from Madeira, and a dark chocolate and raspberry tart for dessert. The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, Prince Harry, the Prince of Wales, the Duchess of Cornwall, the Princess Royal, the Duke of York and the Earl and Countess of Wessex also attended. The Duke of Edinburgh and the Queen gifted the Spanish monarchs love letters from a mutual relative, Queen Ena of Spain Earlier the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh greeted King Felipe and Queen Letizia at Horse Guards Parade, in a traditional welcoming ceremony. The trip is the first state visit by a Spanish king to the UK since Felipe's father, Juan Carlos, came 31 years ago. The Queen gifted King Felipe copies of love letters from his great-grandmother to King Alfonso XIII. Queen Victoria's grand-daughter Princess Victoria Eugenie met King Alfonso on a state visit to Britain in 1905. The pair married and Princess Victoria Eugenie became Queen Ena of Spain, making King Felipe a descendant of Queen Victoria. The wind died down and the sun broke through the clouds just as the Queen and Duke of Edinburgh stepped on to the dais at Horse Guards. Every visiting head of state gets the same welcome - their national anthem and the chance to inspect the guard of honour with Prince Philip. With his retirement imminent, this could be the last time he performed that particular public duty. King Felipe inspected the guard of honour with Prince Philip, on what is expected to be the prince's last state visit before retiring from public engagements this year Then King Felipe stepped into a carriage with the Queen for the traditional procession down the Mall accompanied by the Household Cavalry. The Duke of Edinburgh and Queen Letizia travelled in a separate carriage. It was a chance for Britain to show off how well it can do ""pomp"". On Thursday, Prince Harry will accompany the royal visitors to Westminster Abbey. King Felipe will lay a wreath at the Grave of the Unknown Warrior and the prince will join them on a short tour of the abbey, including the Tomb of Eleanor ""Leonor"" of Castile - the 13th-Century Spanish princess who married Edward I.

"Torn or damaged clothes from the UK, US and other countries often end up in Panipat in India Ever wonder where your clothes go after you discard them? In Western countries, when you donate clothing to charities via shops, collection bags, or clothing banks many are given to those in need or sold in charity shops to raise funds. But what happens to torn or damaged clothes, or items that no one wants to buy? Often, they are sent to India, joining a global second-hand trade in which billions of old garments are bought and sold around the world every year. Specifically, to Panipat in northern India which is known as the world's ""cast off capital"". Every day hundreds of tonnes of clothes from across the UK and the US, and other countries, arrive in Panipat. Outside the town, you can see long queues of trucks waiting to get in. They come here from the port town of Kandla on India's western coast - where ships bring containers full of worn clothes and textiles from all across the world. The businessmen here call them ""mutilated"" clothing. At Shankar Woollen Mills the clothes are first sorted by colour India is the top importer of used clothes, beating countries such as Russia and Pakistan, according tothe most recent data available,external. In India, used clothes can be imported under two different categories - one is mutilated and the other is wearable. To protect local garment manufacturers in India,  importers of wearable clothing need a licence from the government. This licence will only be issued if the buyer guarantees the clothing will not be sold in India, but is instead re-exported. However, the bulk of Indian imports of used clothing happen in the mutilated clothing segment, which doesn't require a licence. In one of the recycling mills, Shankar Woollen Mills, I have to walk over hundreds of colourful buttons on the floor as I try to find my way. It's humid and the piles of woollen clothing seem to be adding to the heat on this already hot summer day. All around me, there are mountains of jackets, skirts, cardigans, berets and what looks like school uniform. From high-street brands to luxury labels - most clothes donated to charity end up here. Piles of torn and used clothing that would have otherwise ended up as landfill. Workers are bent over large blades, shredding clothes. They are ripping everything apart to remove zippers, buttons and labels. The recycled fabric is largely used to make blankets The clothes are then stored in large piles according to their colour: reds, blues, greens and a lot of black.  This is the first step of breaking down the clothes into yarn before they are rewoven into beautiful fabric. They are then processed in batches with similar coloured garments. ""We process it in machines which does what the human hands can't - rip the fabric into smaller rags. ""This is then fed into a bigger machine which mixes wool, silk, cotton and any man-made fibre like polyester and feeds into a carding machine which starts to spin into yarn,"" says Ashwini Kumar, who runs Shankar Woollen Mills shows me what happens next. Every three tonnes of fabric produces around 1.5 tonnes of yarn, which is woven back into what's called ""shoddy"" fabric. The shoddy fabric is then used largely to make blankets. ""They are used as relief material distributed during disasters - so at every tsunami, cyclone or earthquake - anywhere in the world, you see these blankets being distributed,"" adds Mr Kumar. Or the fabric is sold as cheap blankets for the poor costing under $2 (Â£1.55) each. Pawan Garg says the industry has shrunk dramatically Africa is the biggest consumer for what's made here. Almost all traders visit markets in African countries regularly to find new buyers for their recycled fabric. There is a local market too - but it's much smaller. While the cost of importing this textile waste is very low, Mr Kumar is worried that what was once a lucrative business is now getting more expensive. ""Once it reaches India - the custom duties, transportation, storage, electricity and labour costs adds up. Our consumers in Africa want cheap blankets and we are struggling to keep the prices low.""

The industry has also been affected by increased competition from cheaper man-made fibres such as polyester. Pawan Garg, the president of trade body the All India Woollen & Shoddy Mills Association, says the industry has already shrunk dramatically as a result. ""There were once more than 400 units here - now there are less than 100 units. It's taken a very bad hit. The industry is not doing well. Every day - a unit is closing or reducing production. This video can not be played Shilpa Kannan visits the city of Panipat ""Earlier we worked 24/7, now it's hardly a shift a day,"" he says. If the industry continues to shrink it won't just be a problem in India, points out Mr Kumar. He suggests the West could help support the industry. ""What we do here is important work. Think about the impact on the environment if we don't use up these huge mountains of waste. ""In India, things never get wasted. We pass on our clothes to those who need them, and even after that we find ways of using the fabric. I can't think of ever throwing a piece of clothing in the dustbin.""

"This video can not be played Mr Barnier said the UK's financial obligations were not a ""ransom"" The EU's top Brexit negotiator has said there are still major differences between the EU and UK on the rights of EU citizens living in Britain. ""The British position does not allow those persons concerned to continue to live their lives as they do today,"" Michel Barnier said. Mr Barnier said the European Court of Justice (ECJ) must have jurisdiction to guarantee citizens' rights. He also said it was essential that the UK recognise its financial obligations. If Britain did not accept it had some financial obligations, there would be no basis to discuss other issues, he said. UK offer to EU citizens 'falls short' Reality Check: Will the UK pay a â¬60bn 'divorce bill'? Brexit: All you need to know Ahead of the second round of talks next week, Mr Barnier said the EU had made its stance on the issues clear and was waiting on Britain to do the same. ""Our team is ready,"" he said. "" I'm ready. I'm very prepared and willing to work on this very quickly - night and day, the weekend."" ""We want EU citizens in Britain to have the same rights as British citizens who live in the EU,"" he told a news conference. That would require the ECJ to be the ""ultimate guarantor"" of those rights, he said, because Britain could simply change its laws later, creating uncertainty. UK law also imposes restrictions in areas such as reuniting families across borders, he said - something which was not applied to UK citizens living in Spain, for example. Adam Fleming, BBC News, Brussels Michel Barnier's message to the UK was: it's time to get a move on, to provide more clarity about the British position on a range of issues. ""As soon as possible,"" was his request, with the EU's chief negotiator joking that he was willing to work over the weekend and on Friday, which is a bank holiday in his native France. The biggest sticking point appears to be the EU's insistence that Britain settles its outstanding financial obligations. Asked about Boris Johnson's suggestion on Tuesday that the EU could ""go whistle"", he joked that the only sound he could hear was a clock ticking. There was copious evidence of the Barnier charm - but he was happy to turn on the menace, repeating several times that the UK would have to face the ""consequences"" of its choice to depart the EU. Trying to sound eminently reasonable, he denied that his demand for a financial payment was a ""ransom"" or a ""punishment."" Mr Barnier also said that those rights - along with the ""divorce payment"" and border issues - must be dealt with before future UK-EU trade could be discussed. The financial payment the EU says will be owed to cover the UK's commitments is also a key point for Mr Barnier. Estimates have put the amount at anywhere from â¬60bn to â¬100bn (Â£53-89bn). Asked about UK Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson's comment that the EU could ""go whistle"" over the demand, Mr Barnier replied: ""I'm not hearing any whistling. Just the clock ticking."" This video can not be played Boris Johnson's message to the EU: ""Go whistle seems to me to be an entirely appropriate expression"" He denied that the EU was holding the UK government to ransom, and said it was simply a matter of ""trust"". ""It is not an exit bill, it is not a ransom - we won't ask for anything else than what the UK has committed to as a member,"" he said. Mr Barnier also announced he would meet other key politicians on Thursday who were not part of Theresa May's government - including opposition leader Jeremy Corbyn, representatives from the House of Lords, and the first ministers of Scotland and Wales. ""I have always made clear that I will listen to different points on view in the British debate,"" he said. ""Of course, I will only negotiate with the UK government,"" he added.

"On 29 March Theresa May sent a six-page letter notifying the EU of the UK's intention to leave. The Article 50 letter contained a clause little discussed at the time - notifying the EU of the UK's withdrawal from the European Atomic Energy Community, also known as Euratom. But this previously obscure section has now been put under the political spotlight, with some MPs, including a number of Conservatives, gearing up for a fight on the subject. One prominent Leave campaigner has even said the UK should stay in Euratom after Brexit. On Thursday, the government will clarify its stance on the issue in a position paper. But what is Euratom and why does it matter? Euratom regulates the nuclear industry across Europe, safeguarding the transport of nuclear materials, disposing of waste, and carrying out research. It was set up in 1957 alongside the European Economic Community (EEC), which eventually morphed into the EU. The 1957 treaty established a ""nuclear common market"" to enable the free movement of nuclear workers and materials between member states. A nuclear reactor under construction in northern France The UK joined Euratom when it joined the EEC in 1973. It is a separate legal entity from the EU, but is tied up with its laws and institutions, and subject to the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice (ECJ). No country is a full member of Euratom without being a member of the EU. When EU countries transport nuclear materials or trade them with other countries, Euratom sets the rules. The body also co-ordinates research projects across borders. For example the Culham Centre for Fusion Energy, a laboratory near Oxford, is largely funded by the EU and many of its scientists are EU nationals. The Culham Centre for Fusion Energy Euratom also reports to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). If the UK were to leave Euratom it would need to come to a new arrangement with the IAEA. There are two main arguments why Brexit should involve quitting Euratom. Firstly, staying in would raise lots of tricky legal questions. For example, the Euratom treaty states that it applies only on the territory of EU member states. Legal opinion is divided on whether a country could leave the EU and retain Euratom membership, according to research by the House of Commons library. But the UK government has made up its mind. ""The triggering of Article 50 on Euratom is not because we have a fundamental critique of the way that it works. It was because it was a concomitant decision that was required in triggering Article 50,"" said Brexit Secretary David Davis. The second reason for quitting Euratom is the government's interpretation of the Brexit result. Vote Leave campaigned to restore British sovereignty and ""take back control"" by ending the supremacy of EU law over domestic law. In her speech to the Conservative Party conference in October, Theresa May made this rather more specific, pledging to ensure ""the authority of EU law in this country ended forever"". This stance has been called the ""ECJ red line"" - in other words stopping the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg having any authority in the UK. October 2016: Theresa May promises to end ""the authority of EU law in this country"" The nuclear agreement is underpinned by the ECJ. That means if states signed up to the Euratom treaty breach its terms, they can be hauled before European judges. This could happen to Britain after Brexit, if it remains signed up to Euratom. Full membership would apparently be incompatible with a strict interpretation of the ECJ red line. Also, the Euratom treaty requires members to allow the free movement of nuclear scientists, which could fall foul of the government's wish to cut net migration drastically from its current level. Dominic Cummings, who was campaign director of Vote Leave, this week criticised what he called ""government morons"" who want to withdraw from Euratom. ""Tory Party keeps making huge misjudgements re what the REF was about. EURATOM was different treaties, ECJ role no signif problem,"" he said on Twitter. Although the agreement is overseen by the ECJ, the court does not intervene very often, according to those who want to stay in. Conservative MP Ed Vaizey and Labour MP Rachel Reeves publishedan article in the Sunday Telegraph,externalthis week defending Euratom membership. ""There appears never to have been an ECJ case involving the UK and Euratom,"" they said. ""Whatever people were voting for last June, it certainly wasn't to junk 60 years of co-operation in this area with our friends and allies."" James Chapman, a former special adviser to David Davis, has also criticised the application of the ""ECJ red line"" to Euratom: ""I would have thought the UK would like to continue welcoming nuclear scientists who are all probably being paid six figures and are paying lots of tax,""he told the BBC last month. ""But we're withdrawing from it because of this absolutist position on the European court. I think she [the prime minister] could show some flexibility in that area."" Mr Vaizey and Ms Reeves also raised the issue of cancer medication. Euratom supports the ""secure and safe supply and use of medical radioisotopes"". Radioactive isotopes are essential for various types of cancer treatment but cannot be stockpiled because they decay quickly. In the UK they are imported, often from Belgium and the Netherlands. Some experts worry that leaving the treaty will delay the delivery of drugs to patients who need them. Global demand for isotopes is rising rapidly, and many of the reactors that produce them are getting old. Radioactive isotopes used to treat cancer The government's answer to this is that medical isotopes are not fissile nuclear material - that is, capable of reacting - so they are not subject to international nuclear safeguards. According to Science Minister Jo Johnson, their availability ""should not be impacted by the UK's exit from Euratom"". In February, Parliament passed a bill giving the government permission to trigger Article 50. Labour MPs tried to add an amendment keeping the UK in Euratom, but it was comfortably voted down. Last month Theresa May's Conservatives lost their majority in the general election, which has emboldened opponents to the government's Brexit stance. Though the government's position has been firmed up by signing a confidence-and-supply deal with the DUP, it can still lose key votes if just seven Conservatives vote the other way. Several of Ed Vaizey's colleagues have backed his position on Euratom. Given the Labour manifesto pledge to ""retain access"" to the nuclear agency, this means the government could well lose a vote on the issue. Given that Euratom was explicitly mentioned in the Article 50 letter, any reversal of withdrawal would be difficult, and an act of Parliament would probably not be enough. Changing or reversing the UK's withdrawal from Euratom would probably need to be done formally by the government. If that were to happen, it would raise another contentious legal question - whether the notification of withdrawal from the EUcan be amended or revoked. The government really does not want to open that can of worms. What's more, staying in the nuclear agreement would not be a matter purely for the UK to decide. The EU,which has published a position paper,externalon Britain's departure from Euratom, would also have to agree. That could make things complicated. Various options have been mooted for an alternative to full Euratom membership. Switzerland, not an EU member, has a special status as an equal partner as an ""associated country"". This could be an option explored by the UK. But sticking to the ECJ red line might make that path difficult. Beznau nuclear power plant in Switzerland - the country is a partner with Euratom Euratom also has looser co-operation agreements with other countries such as the US and Australia. These third-party countries help fund projects such as the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor in France, which is run by Euratom. But moving to a looser agreement could cause disruption when the UK is so integrated into the EU's nuclear energy market. Given the long timescale needed for nuclear projects, scientists worry about the uncertainty. The final arrangements between the UK and Euratom after Brexit will have big repercussions for a country which is committed to atomic energy for the long term - unlike Germany, which ditched nuclear power in the wake of the 2011 Fukushima disaster. Last September the governmentapproved a new Â£18bn power station, financed by the French and Chinese governments, at Hinkley Point in Somerset. Hinkley Point in Somerset is to be the site of a new nuclear power station Sellafield, where plutonium is reprocessed and stored, is Europe's largest nuclear facility. The Cumbria site has the largest stockpile of civil plutonium in the world. Euratom runs the on-site laboratory there, and also spends a big chunk of its EU-wide resources running safeguard checks there. There's also the centre at Culham, where Euratom plays a big role. In May the Commons Energy Committee, which has been investigating the impact of Brexit on energy policy,urged the UK to delay leaving Europe's nuclear regulator. Power supplies could be threatened if a new regulator was not ready, it said. Whatever decision is finally made on Euratom, it will matter for decades to come.

Thanks for joining us for our Prime Minister's Questions coverage - you can keep across all proceedings in the Commons and the Lordscourtesy of our BBC Parliament colleagues. Pro-EU campaigners have weighed in on Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson following EU negotiator Michel Barnier's remarks earlier (read about them here). Mr Barnier reacted to Mr Johnson's ""go whistle"" remarks about the UK's divorce bill by saying: ""I'm not hearing any whistling. Just the clock ticking."" Here's what Labour MP Ben Bradshaw, of the Open Britain campaign group, has said in response. Barnierâs comments today show that Boris Johnsonâs flippancy and rudeness is undermining our interests.""  Grenfell Tower fire debate House of CommonsParliament The main business of the day, a general debate onthe inquiry on the Grenfell Tower fire, is now under way in the House of Commons. First Secretary of State Damian Green kicks off the debate, saying that words feel inadequate in expressing sympathy to those whose suffering is ""beyond imagining"". This debate provides an opportunity for Parliament to express its views about the scope of the inquiry before the terms of reference are set. The detailed results of who's in the chair of the powerful select committees will shine a fascinating light on the fault-lines of the new House of Commons. Mosul statement House of CommonsParliament Ms Osamor also raises theAmnesty International report,externalpublished yesterday, which accuses the Iraqi-led forces of using unnecessarily powerful weapons during the fighting. The report also cites major abuses by IS, including the use of human shields and summary executions. The international development secretary says it is important to stress the security forces and coalition have made ""every effort"" to protect civilians. She says that any accusations need to be ""thoroughly and transparently"" investigated, and those found responsible held to account. The Daily Politics Labour MP Chris Bryant will bid to introduce a new criminal offence of attacking a member of the emergency services while they are doing their job. The proposal was chosen by a public vote after Mr Bryant came top of the private members' bill ballot - a chance for backbenchers to introduce new laws. He put six ideas to the public vote and the emergency services bill came top with 10,764 votes, ahead of a plan to help refugee families, he tells the Daily Politics. He said ambulance workers, fire fighters and others had been attacked in recent years ""and the law simply isn't strong enough to protect them"".  Emily Thornberry urges ministers to ""get a grip"" as Damian Green insists EU talks are ""going well"". This video can not be played The EU chief negotiator says the UK is being asked for what it has ""legally undertaken to provide"". The government is about to set out its position on membership of Europe's nuclear regulator after Brexit. The Daily Politics Paying for single market access might be an option for the government, says Laura Kuenssberg, because ministers have consistently refused to rule it out. The Daily Politics Labour MP Jack Dromey hints at a Brexit ""red line"" for Labour, saying the public would find a Â£100bn EU divorce bill ""unacceptable"". But he suggests the UK could pay for continued access to the single market. He also stresses that his party would ""never contemplate walking away from the table"", as the Conservatives have said they would if there was a ""bad"" deal on offer. Conservative minister David Gauke refuses to rule out paying for continued access to the single market. Mosul statement House of CommonsParliament Shadow international development secretary Kate Osamor welcomes the statement and joins Priti Patel in praising Iraqi soldiers. She says she wants to pay ""particular tribute"" to the UK government's role in the country and says the UK's continued role and the significant funding commitments outlined in the statement ""will save lives"" and help rebuild Mosul. Ms Osamor says the government must focus not only on rebuilding but on rehousing those displaced by the violence, in Mosul and elsewhere in Iraq. Allow Twitter content?

Mosul statement House of CommonsParliament The International Development Secretary Priti Patel says the Iraqi government must address grievances that led to the rise of the terrorist group IS. In this aim, the UK will be ""steadfast"" in its support for the government of Iraq to drive forward reform and reconciliation in the country. The Daily Politics The publication of an Office for Budget Responsbility report on fiscal risks tomorrow, as revealed by Damian Green, could be significant, suggests Laura Kuenssberg. ""We are going to get an independent assessment of the varous different outcomes of whatever happens with Brexit,"" she adds. These could be numbers ""that have an impact in this debate"", she adds, particularly as there a ""range of opinions"" among ministers on Brexit, as Emily Thornberry highlighted at PMQs.

Mosul statement House of CommonsParliament Priti Patel says that victory in Mosul comes after three years of fear, executions, abductions, destruction, and forced marriages under so-called Islamic State. It is a ""great victory"" for the people of Iraq and ""a great stride forward"" in global security, she says, and  praises Iraqi and Kurdish forces for their ""courage and sacrifice"" and in acting to reduce civilian casualties ""wherever they could"". She warns however that we must be ""realistic"" about the challenges ahead. The UK has been at the forefront of the humanitarian response, she says, and tells MPs that UK aid to Mosul will be Â£40m this year, bringing the total commitment in Iraq up to Â£209m since 2014. Mosul statement House of CommonsParliament International Development Secretary Priti Patel is now giving a statement on the humanitarian situation in the city of Mosul, Iraq. The Daily Politics Damian Green and Emily Thornberry are both experienced performers at the despatch box and appeared to be ""really enjoying"" standing in for their leaders even if their exchanges didn't get us anywhere, says BBC Political Editor Laura Kuenssberg Â© 2025 BBC.
