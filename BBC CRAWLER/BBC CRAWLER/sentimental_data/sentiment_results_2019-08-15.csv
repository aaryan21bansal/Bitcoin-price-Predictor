"The facial-recognition system at King's Cross is to be investigated by the UK's data-protection watchdog. Media exposure of live facial recognition at the siteprompted the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) to look into how it was being used,external. The ICO will inspect the technology in place and how it is operated to ensure it does not break data protection laws. The regulator said it was ""deeply concerned"" about the growing use of facial-recognition technology. TheFinancial Times was the first to report,externala live face-scanning system was being used across the 67-acre (0.3-sq-km) site around King's Cross station in London. Developer Argent said it used the technology to ""ensure public safety"" and it was just one of ""a number of detection and tracking methods"" in place at the site. But the use of cameras and databases to work out who is passing through and using the site has proved controversial. So far, Argent has not said how long it has been using facial-recognition cameras, what is the legal basis for their use, or what systems it has in place to protect the data it collects. In its statement, the ICO said: ""Scanning people's faces as they lawfully go about their daily lives, in order to identify them, is a potential threat to privacy that should concern us all."" The regulator said it was keen to ensure that King's Cross developer was using the technology in accordance with UK laws governing the use of data. King's Cross developer quizzed on face recognition Facial recognition use prompts call for new laws ""Put simply, any organisations wanting to use facial recognition technology must comply with the law - and they must do so in a fair, transparent and accountable way,"" said the ICO. It must have documented how and why it believed its use of the technology was legal, proportionate and justified, it added. Argent has not yet responded to a request for comment by BBC News. The mayor of London is also quizzing developer Argent about its use of facial-recognition systems. Sadiq Khan wrote to the company and said there was ""serious and widespread concern"" about the legality of facial recognition. King's Cross developer quizzed on face recognition Biased and wrong?

"Peter Duncan died in hospital shortly after being attacked A 52-year-old lawyer who was stabbed to death with a screwdriver in a busy shopping centre was a devoted father, his family has said. Peter Duncan was attacked after what police said was a chance ""coming together"" with a group of youths near Old Eldon Square in Newcastle. He was attacked at about 18:20 BST on Wednesday and died later in hospital. Seven teenage boys have been arrested on suspicion of his murder. The boys, a 14 year-old, two 15-year-olds and four 17-year-olds, remain in custody. Northumbria Police said it believed Mr Duncan was attacked after a ""chance encounter"" outside a branch of Greggs. A cordon was put in place in Eldon Square Mr Duncan, from Newcastle, was described by his family as a ""devoted father and husband"". ""Peter was a kind and caring man who was always first to help others,"" they added. ""He was a devoted father, husband, son, brother, uncle and friend and loved by all who knew him. ""His death will leave such a huge hole in our lives and he'll be deeply missed by us all."" According to his profile on LinkedIn, Mr Duncan trained as an electrical engineer before graduating from Northumbria University with a law degree in 2003. He was working as legal counsel in the Newcastle office of Royal IHC Limited, and previously as a solicitor and legal advisor with other companies in Darlington and Newcastle. Ch Supt Ged Noble said it appeared there had been a ""coming together"" at the entrance to the shopping centre, which led to Mr Duncan receiving a single puncture wound to the chest. He added: ""This was a tragic incident and our thoughts go out to Peter's family and friends at this incredibly difficult time. ""Peter's family have requested that their privacy is respected during this difficult time. ""We will be continuing extra patrols in the area and I would urge anyone with concerns to speak to an officer.""

"Conor Coady has ""quite a big connection with the fans"", the club said Wolves captain Conor Coady has written to all 48 fans who made the 6,370-mile round trip to their match in Armenia. He thanked those who saw the team beat Pyunik 4-0 in the Europa League last week, with Wolves in Europe this season for the first time since 1980. Tickets for the third qualifying round first-leg game in Yerevan were Â£1, but the expedition cost fans ""something like"" Â£1,000, the club said. Coady had wanted to say thanks and this was ""not a publicity stunt"", it added. The letters were all signed individually and had the fans' names on, Wolves said. Supporter Brian Jones, 60, who has watched Wolves since 1969, said it was ""a bit of a surprise"". It was ""not unusual"" for Coady to be the first player to go across to applaud fans at the end of games, he said. ""He's come through as very iconic really in terms of the development of the club. He gives the impression of [having] a real affinity with supporters. ""I don't think too many football supporters have a letter from the captain, [it's] a nice touch."" Raul Jimenez was a big threat in Armenia Coady wrote that he hoped the players made the trip for the first-leg game worthwhile for fans, Mr Jones said. The supporter, from Nottingham, said he knew of one man who had not missed a match since 1971 and only arrived with 18 minutes left in Armenia following a delayed flight. Mr Jones himself waited about six hours for his flight from Moscow and chatted to a Russian football fan with the help of ""Google Translate"", but felt ""quite privileged"" to have been to Armenia, where ""the most we paid for a pint was Â£2"". ""It shouldn't be forgotten there were loads who'd have loved to have gone, but it was very expensive, it was quite short notice."" A Wolves spokesman said: ""He came to us, he wanted to come up with an idea to say 'thank you' to the travelling fans. ""It was such a big effort for those 48 to go there [with] no direct flights and [it costing] something like over and above Â£1,000 to get there with the flights and hotel."" Coady has got ""quite a big connection with the fans and they've got a connection with him,"" the spokesman added. ""It's not something he's done as a publicity stunt, but a genuine thank you to the fans.""

"This video can not be played Abdulah Husseini (left) was parodied by David Schwimmer on Twitter A lookalike of Friends actor David Schwimmer has been jailed for theft and fraud offences. A CCTV image of Abdulah Husseini, 36, clutching a crate of beer went viral after police posted it in an appeal to trace him in October. Husseini, who was described in court as a ""wandering, nomadic thief"", used a stolen bank card to make or attempt to make fraudulent purchases in Blackpool. He was jailed for nine months at Burnley Crown Court on Thursday. Judge Dodd told Husseini he had an ""appalling criminal history"" Husseini, described by Judge Sara Dodd as ""an habitual thief"", had walked into a restaurant in the Lancashire resort and swiped a wallet from a customer's jacket while he was away from his table. He then made two purchases at nearby stores using a card from the wallet before CCTV showed him carrying cans of beers to the till at an Iceland store, the court heard. A month later, Blackpool Police posted the CCTV image on its Facebook page. The post went viral with more than 11m shares and 30,000 comments as members of the public pointed out the suspect's likeness to Friends character Ross Geller. The jacket was taken from a restaurant in Blackpool's town centre Schwimmer responded with a video onTwitter and Instagram,externalin which the star was seen furtively glancing at a camera as he walked through a convenience store clutching cans of beer. ""Officers, I swear it wasn't me,"" he said in an accompanying post. Husseini, an Iranian national from Slough, denied the offences but he was convicted by a jury after a two-day trial of one count of theft and four counts of fraud by false representation. The court heard he has 32 previous convictions for 60 offences since 2008, including 27 offences for theft and dishonesty. In mitigation, his barrister, Rebecca Filletti, said her client had problems with drugs but had made ""significant efforts"" to overcome his addiction while in custody.

She claims she was physically sick with grief, but the 18-year-old student was told to find cover or risk dismissal. Unable to find a replacement, she said her part-time job in a sandwich shop was terminated. Ms McNulty described the death of Millie as like ""losing a member of the family"". She has started a petition asking for employers to recognise pet bereavement in the same way as a human family member. Her online change.org petition has already gained more than 700 supporters. ""I was sacked on the same day as I lost my dog,"" she said. ""Millie was 14 and I am 18, so I don't remember a time when she wasn't part of my life. ""We did everything together. I was so close to her and she was my best pal."" Emma McNulty's beloved per Millie died unexpectedly Ms McNulty added: ""She became ill on Saturday night and we had to have her put to sleep on Sunday. I was devastated, distraught and physically sick. ""I thought my employer would show a bit of compassion. Instead I was told to find cover and that if I didn't come in I would risk dismissal. ""When I told them I couldn't find a replacement I was told not to show up for any other shifts and that the boss would be in touch."" Ms McNulty said she was dismissed for not turning up for a planned shift. Since starting her online petition she has received dozens of messages of support. Daniel Taylor wrote: ""Dogs are family. You should be allowed to grieve for them too."" Tracy Rawding added: ""Pets are family members and the grief is very real."" And Geraldine Kennedy posted: ""This is no different to losing a human family member. Our animals mean more to us than our human family and we should be allowed the same time to grieve their loss."" Inseparable: Millie and Emma McNulty Arbitration service Acas has producedguidance for employers around bereavement,external. It says: ""Grief impacts on the emotional, physical, spiritual and psychological well-being of the person who is bereaved. At any time research indicates one in 10 employees is likely to be affected by bereavement. ""Bereavement in the workplace can be challenging to manage: employees may need to take time off unexpectedly; find their performance is impacted, or be temporarily unable to perform certain roles. ""However, a compassionate and supportive approach demonstrates that the organisation values its employees, helps build commitment, reduce sickness absence, and retain the workforce."" Diane James, pet bereavement support service manager at Blue Cross, said: ""We fully support understanding employers who offer bereavement leave to allow time for pet owners to come to terms with their loss. ""We have been helping pet owners for 25 years and are contacted by over 12,000 devastated pet owners every year who are struggling to cope."" As an employee, you have a right to time off to deal with an emergency involving a dependant. A dependant could be a spouse, partner, child, grandchild, parent, or someone who depends on you for care. However, it is unlikely a pet would be included in this benefit. According to the UK government website, compassionate leave can be granted by an employer as paid or unpaid leave for emergency situations. However, this is at the discretion of the employer. The site advises checking your employment contract, company handbook or intranet for details about the company's policy on compassionate leave. A spokesman for Acas said: ""The law gives a day one right for an employee to have reasonable time off work to deal with a bereavement involving a dependant. ""Bereavement is a very personal issue and can affect different people in different ways. ""Pets are not specifically mentioned within workplace bereavement legislation but the death of a beloved pet can impact a worker's mental health and a good employer should be sensitive and mindful of their employees' wellbeing.""

"Liu Xiaoming, China's ambassador to the UK, made the remarks during a press conference China's ambassador to the UK has warned British politicians against interfering in Hong Kong's affairs, amid clashes between protesters and police. Liu Xiaoming said the UK should ""refrain from saying or doing anything that interferes or undermines the rule of law in Hong Kong"". Some British politicians think ""their hands are still in the colonial days"", he told a press conference in London. The UK has called for ""calm from all sides"". Millions of Hong Kong citizens have taken part in 10 weeks of anti-government protests, demanding democratic reform and an investigation into alleged police brutality. While many of the demonstrations were peaceful, an increasing number have ended in violent clashes with police. The background you need on the Hong Kong protests China labels HK protests as 'near terrorism' Trump suggests 'personal meeting' with China's Xi Mr Liu's warning comes days after the Chinese foreign ministry told Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab to stop interfering in Hong Kong's affairs. He accused some British politicians of viewing Hong Kong as ""part of the British empire"". He made the comment in response to a question about a proposal by Commons Foreign Affairs Select Committee chairman Tom Tugendhat to extend UK citizenship rights to Hong Kong Chinese. ""I think some of them still regard Hong Kong as part of British empire and they treat Hong Kong as part of the UK,"" Mr Liu said. ""They are going to have to change their mindset, put them in the proper position and regard Hong Kong as a part of China, not as a part of the UK,"" he added. By James Robbins, BBC diplomatic correspondent China's Ambassador in London was forthright and uncompromising. Liu Xiaoming can be relied on by Beijing to deliver strong messages in the clearest of English. He is proud of having served in London for almost 10 years, since Gordon Brown was prime minister. Now he is warning that Beijing is ready to intervene in Hong Kong with its own security forces if China judges that necessary ""to quell the unrest swiftly"". He is broadening complaints of foreign interference - talking of unnamed ""foreign forces"" and accusing Britain in particular of interference in what he regards as purely a Chinese internal matter. British government pressure for substantial dialogue in Hong Kong is simply rejected. British politicians are dismissed as continuing to live in their imperial past. But any deployment of Chinese military police or other security forces over the border and into Hong Kong would be a huge and risky step - posing its own threat to the strictly limited autonomy of Hong Kong, which foreign investors and traders still clearly value highly. So, for now, the warning remains just that. Hong Kong, which was a British colony until 1997, is a special administrative region of China, giving it greater independence. The Sino-British Joint Declaration signed in 1984 said Hong Kong would enjoy a ""high degree of autonomy, except in foreign and defence affairs"" and be ""vested with executive, legislative and independent judicial power"". Mr Liu questioned whether the government would allow protesters to commit ""crimes"" in the UK. ""Would the UK allow extremists to storm the Palace of Westminster and damage its facilities and get away with it?"" he said. ""Would the UK give permission for attacking police officers with lethal weapons or set fire to police stations without any punishment? ""Would the UK allow so-called pro-democracy rioters to occupy the airport, obstruct traffic, disturb social order or threaten the safety and people's life and property? ""Aren't all these regarded as crimes in the UK?"" In recent weeks protesters have stormed the Chinese government office in Hong Kong and defaced the national emblem, and also laid siege to police stations. Some protesters argue they have been forced to resort to more confrontational tactics, as peaceful protests have not worked. Mr Liu also condemned unnamed ""Western politicians and organisations"" for lending ""support to violent radicals"" and trying to ""obstruct Hong Kong's police from bringing the violent offenders to justice"". ""Foreign forces must stop interfering in Hong Kong's affairs,"" he said. ""Evidence shows that the situation in Hong Kong would not have deteriorated so much if it had not been for the interference and incitement of foreign forces."" Activists in Hong Kong have denied that foreign governments are involved in the movement, while observers say the protests have largely appeared leaderless and unpredictable. This video can not be played Comedian Bill Bailey witnesses ""chaos"" at Hong Kong airport during the protests on 13 August The protests initially started after Hong Kong introduced a bill in April that would allow those accused of crimes against mainland China to be extradited there. The bill's critics said the move could endanger activists and journalists, and result in those accused facing unfair trials and violent treatment. The bill was suspended in June after hundreds of people took to the streets in protest. The protesters have since called for thecomplete withdrawal of the extradition bill and for other democratic reforms, including amnesty for all arrested activists.

Michael VaughanEx-England captain on BBC Test Match Special I think there is going to be a result. Jonathan AgnewBBC cricket correspondent Smith is human, he's not Bradman. Simon Hughes was watching him in the nets and he nicked one straight to where slip would be. If Archer can bowl with hostility at him I think it will be a great contest Michael VaughanEx-England captain on BBC Test Match Special It's about the way you bat and Roy is too good a player to try and crash his first ball. The way he played at Edgbaston in the second innings to get to 28 was lovely. There are worries there but there are worries about Buttler at number five, he looks to have lost the confidence to play at Test level. There are too many of them that you ask if they have got the basics for Test cricket. The best technician in the side at the moment is Chris Woakes. Jonathan AgnewBBC cricket correspondent Tomorrow is a big first session. The forecast isn't great but there is time for Australia to build a big first-innings lead. Stuart Broad struck before stumps, dismissing David Warner for the third time in this series, but you'd imagine Australia will be the happier of the two sides. Australian spinner Nathan Lyon, on whether he is pleased with Australia's day:""Definitely I don't think we have had our best day, we dropped a few catches but if we are batting at the end of the day we are pretty happy. We want to be a team that no matter what we do first we are competing and playing a positive brand of cricket."" On equalling Dennis Lillee's 355 Test wickets:""I have always said I am not one for personal milestones but it is a pleasing thing, it is pretty hard to see my name alongside the true legends of Australian cricket. It's a special moment and hopefully a few more will come."" Still, Australia's bowlers vindicated Tim Paine's decision to field first as England were dismissed for 258. There were three wickets apiece for Josh Hazlewood, Pat Cummins and Nathan Lyon, and one for Peter Siddle. Phil TufnellEx-England spinner on BBC Test Match Special Buttler looks short of runs and without Woakes it would have been a sorry old state. Michael VaughanEx-England captain on BBC Test Match Special England's 258 is competitive in a way but with the amount of talent in that line up they will have expected someone to get three figures. Cummins after lunch was right up there with the best you'll see. The technical side of England's batting is a worry, I don't think they are out of this Test at all, we saw the wicket that got Warner was a beauty. Australia look like they are very driven and you would expect them to make it very difficult. England lost 4-46 before a 70-run stand between Jonny Bairstow, who made a welcome half-century, and Chris Woakes spared a few blushes. England opener Rory Burns:""There was a little bit there throughout the day but it was one of those wickets where if they missed you could still get on top of it. There was some good bowling, a bit of nibble and we have seen in that period if you stick enough balls in the right areas it can be difficult."" Rory Burns looked good for his 53 - although he was dropped twice - and he and Joe Denly had a good, 70-run partnership that ended far too early for England's liking. Alec StewartEx-England captain on BBC Test Match Special It has not been a good day for England. It has been another sloppy batting performance. It could have been worse but they have got to bat with more discipline. Text 81111 Just flew over London on my way home from the Alps, eyes fixed on an illuminated Lord's, I could hear the roar of that wicket from here. Good to be home. Scott arriving at Heathrow Phil TufnellEx-England spinner on BBC Test Match Special Careless batting again from England, lots of 20's and 30's but Australia just realised they had to plug away and the chances would come. So, England were put in to bat this morning by Australia and, if we're honest, it was all a bit predictable. Phil TufnellEx-England spinner on BBC Test Match Special I think it's going to be another great Test match. Hopefully we won't lose too much time tomorrow, there is still enough time for a winner.

" Mission Jurassic: Searching for dinosaur bones Mission Jurassic: Searching for dinosaur bones By Jonathan Amos The stench was unbearable. The hulking mass of dead dinosaur had lain on the sandbar now for over a week in stifling heat, half-buried among the decaying vegetation and sediment. Some scavengers had tried to rip the putrid flesh from its bones, but the floodwaters kept washing over the site, dumping yet more mud and debris. The open carcass of this 40-tonne giant was filling with all kinds of muck and beginning to disappear from view. The Earth itself was consuming the animal for geologic preservation. Fast-forward 150 million years and the University of Manchester’s Phil Manning is on his knees in a tennis court-sized quarry in the ""Badlands"" of North Wyoming. He's narrating this Jurassic death story as he points to the tangle of fossil bones in front of us. Remnants of leg, shoulder and spine have been worked proud of the sandstone. There's no doubting even to our untrained eyes that this is a sauropod - one of those huge plant-eating dinos that had a long neck and a long tail. Phil scrambles to his right to put his hand on a long stretch of brown-coloured rock. It's the fallen tree trunk that probably corralled the rotting beast and finally pulled it from the torrent, along with who knows how many other creatures now frozen in stone in this quarry. Phil sits back on his heels. He's like the detective who's just walked in on a murder scene, assessed the available evidence and constructed an initial take on the final moments of horror. ""Just imagine: a fetid mess of deadness. Wonderful!"" he grins.  ""It's rare that you get to see so many bones strewn in front of you like this. There are so many on this site it's like 'pick-up sticks',"" the British scientist continues. ""There's probably enough dinosaur material here to keep a thousand palaeontologists happy for a thousand years."" Phil doesn't have quite that long. The Children's Museum of Indianapolis (TCMI), where he's also a scientist in residence, has signed a 20-year exploration lease on a parcel of Wyoming ranch land measuring one sq mile (260 hectares) in area. Phil therefore has just two decades, the remainder of his career, to see what treasures can be unearthed. And he needs every bit of help he can get. That's why, in addition to TCMI staff, he's called in Dutch colleagues from the Naturalis Biodiversity Center in Leiden, and UK associates from the University of Manchester, and London's Natural History Museum (NHM). From the UK's perspective, ""Mission Jurassic"", as it's been dubbed, represents arguably the country's biggest dinosaur hunt in decades. Phil and his co-chief scientist, Victoria Egerton, have organised the partners into work teams to systematically scrape back the layers of two pilot quarries. The participants are down on all fours, edging forwards in CSI formation, gently probing the pliable sediments with bayonets. When you hit dinosaur bone, it sounds different, says NHM PhD student Joe Bonsor as he invites us to get in the dirt and ""have a go"". To illustrate his point, he picks up a piece and taps it with his knife to produce a kind of metallic chinking noise. The porous material also sticks hard to your tongue if you lick it, and again Joe demonstrates. ""Yeah, you have to be careful with that one; prairie dog poo has the same effect,"" quips his NHM supervisor Susie Maidment. The positions of fossils are first marked with flags to show everyone where not to tread. Although, with some bones nearly 2m in length, they’re pretty obvious. Discoveries are then mapped and prepped for removal. Extraction involves digging a pedestal around the specimen before giving it a plaster-of-Paris covering. It’s a messy job, but the hard “jacket”, when it eventually sets, will provide protection for the ride back to the lab. So far, Mission Jurassic has definitively identified at least four of those mighty sauropods. One could be 30m nose-to-tail; another perhaps 24m. There are some meat-eating allosaurs, too, waiting to be transported off-site.These finds barely begin to describe the potential of what's here, however. And it's not just bones: it's also the trackways left by dinosaurs as they sploshed through mud, now turned to stone, and a profusion of fossil plants that record what these giants ate.  Wyoming boasts a breathtaking landscape: mountains and plains and everything in between. We're in hot, arid terrain in the Big Horn basin, close to the border with Montana. Cowboys are mending fences and the prairie dogs are scuttling between the juniper bushes.   Precisely where we are, we're not allowed to say. There are fossil thieves who would almost certainly try to raid the square mile if they knew its location. We're even asked to switch off the geotagging on our phones and to avoid taking photographs that feature the horizon. An overly revealing social media post might give the game away. Not that dinosaurs are hard to find in these parts. Wyoming is the US state where the ""bone rush"" really began back in the 1870s. As the railroad pushed west after the Civil War, reports began to emerge of a fossil bounty, of countless specimens literally falling out of the hillsides. Today, all self-respecting palaeontologists have to make at least one pilgrimage to the state during their lives. From Pangea to the present day From Pangea to the present day Its geology captures a huge segment through the Mesozoic Era, the time when dinosaurs came to prominence.  A particular draw is the Morrison Formation, a roughly 10-million-year sequence of rocks from the Late Jurassic Period. This covers an immense swathe of the US western interior, but Wyoming hosts some of its most spectacular outcrops. ""The Morrison's got all the dinosaurs we knew when we were seven - Stegosaurus, Diplodocus, Brachiosaurus and Allosaurus. It's incredibly rich,"" says Susie Maidment who's come here in the hope of finding new species, or at least some slightly different versions of her childhood favourites. What makes the Morrison so rich in fossils is the ancient environment it reflects. One hundred and fifty million years ago, Wyoming was anything but arid. It was semi-tropical and featured big rivers that meandered across vast plains. ""There was a lot of rain, a lot of storms - a lot of water being pushed around, and that means a lot of sediment being pushed around as well,"" explains local palaeontologist Jack Turnbull. ""Flash floods, mudslides, landslides - and all that moving sediment, every now and then, would bury animals and plants on a large scale. It's the only way we can explain the productivity of fossils that we find in the Morrison."" But as hazardous as this all sounds, it was also a time when the animals living on these wide river plains found great success. And this is evident in the size of the sauropods. Only whales in Earth history have out-bulked these creatures, and the Late Jurassic is when their gigantism kicks in. That's something of a puzzle, says TCMI and Manchester scientist  Victoria Egerton as she scratches at a crumbling cliff face and pulls out yet more of the Morrison's preserved vegetation. ""The plants are completely different from what we see around us today; flowering plants had yet to evolve,"" she explains, breaking open chunks of mudstone with her fingers to reveal fossil stems and twigs. ""In fact, these dinosaurs were eating things that we would consider to be very nutritionally poor - things like conifers (think 'monkey puzzle' trees), ferns, ginkgos, cycads and large horsetails. And we would love to be able to understand how they ate this food and still got to be the enormous sizes they evidently did."" In a circular way, part of the answer lies in the fact that they were so big. If you want to derive as much calorific value as possible from so impoverished a feedstock, you employ a giant fermentation tank. That's essentially what sauropods were: colossal fermentation tanks on legs. And with their long necks they would rake vegetation from their surroundings for perhaps 16-20 hours a day. They can't have had much time for sleep. ""They were extraordinary animals,"" says NHM palaeobiologist Paul Barrett. ""Colleagues have called them 'ecosystem engineers' because their behaviour would have had a major effect on the physical appearance of an environment, not just in eating the vegetation but in clearing it out. ""Think also about the effects they would have had in terms of the geochemistry from their defecation as they moved through the landscape. ""The runoff would be influencing the amount of nutrients entering rivers. The seeds they dispersed were potentially controlling the distribution and germination of a number of different types of plants."" The history of science is littered with rivalries but the animosity that drove Othniel Charles Marsh and Edward Drinker Cope was something else. These two individuals went to war in the 1870s to prove their paleontological prowess and intellectual superiority. The collectors turned Wyoming and adjoining states into a fossil battlefield as they raced to unearth and describe new dinosaurs. To try to out-do each other, they employed the most underhand of tactics, including bribery and sabotage. Every scientific publication by one was immediately trashed by the other. Marsh's and Cope's obsession nearly bankrupted them both. But in this manic pursuit of one-upmanship, they pushed the science forward, introducing to the world more than 130 new species of dinosaur. One of their big reveals was Stegosaurus, the rhino-sized animal that's instantly recognisable to all thanks to the row of sharp bony plates along its spine. Visitors to London'sNatural History Museumcan see a particularly fine example. This specimen, nicknamed ""Sophie"", is the most complete in the world. It was discovered in the Morrison Formation in 2003, just down the road from the Mission Jurassic dig site. Sophie's story is a good illustration of what will happen next to the creatures currently being pulled from the Badlands rock. Their bones will go to the TCMI lab where they'll be relieved of their plaster jackets, cleaned of any extraneous sediment and then subjected to a battery of tests. Whereas early palaeontologists might have done little more than describe the beasts and try to reassemble their bones in a best-fit posture, today's researchers use an ever-more sophisticated set of tools to bring the animals back to life - in the digital sense. Bones loaded on to the back of a truck Bones loaded on to the back of a truck The fossils are examined to see where ligaments and tendons attached. Computer models will then add muscle and skin; feathers even, if there's evidence they were present. Bob Nicholls / Paleocreations 2014 Bob Nicholls / Paleocreations 2014 This is where those preserved trackways are insightful because all this information can be used to reconstruct a dinosaur's movement, and that will help with the broader picture of how the animal negotiated its environment: what kind of distances could it cover? How much energy would that mobility expend? One of the newer techniques involves fine X-ray investigation of the fossils to look at their chemical make-up. ""This can tell you how fast the animal was growing and whether it experienced some hard periods in its life because that growth was stunted,"" says TCMI's Jennifer Anné. ""If you're really, really fortunate, you might find something we call medullary bone, which we think means the dinosaur was getting ready to lay eggs. You can also see if they had an injury and how well it healed; and sometimes you can see evidence of disease, maybe an infection or arthritis.""  Sophie displayed no obvious defects on her bones, nothing that points to disease or predation. The suspicion is she may simply have been unlucky and died from starvation during one bad season. Today, the technology that's having a major impact on palaeontology is 3D printing. This is revolutionising scientists' ability to study and share specimens. ""It's so easy to do scaling,"" says Anne Schulp, another vertebrate palaeontologist from the Naturalis Biodiversity Center. ""If you have a younger, smaller Triceratops with some bones missing, you simply go to a larger animal, dial down the size of its bones and click print. And it's great for education. We now have a T. rex that you can download and build yourself."" The bones of the Mission Jurassic sauropods are somewhat jumbled up; quite a few are missing. It's going to require therefore a bit of interpretation and printing to reconstruct the animals. The Indianapolis Children’s Museumhas first claim to keep and display the giants, but both Naturalis and the Natural History Museum could easily mount their own 3D copies back in Europe. ""Do you want to see the Sundance? It's pretty special,"" says Mark Graham, an NHM fossil preparator. ""If you do, we've really got to go now before it gets too hot."" The Sundance is the ""big bonus"" in the Mission Jurassic square mile.  It's an older sequence of rocks that sits below the Morrison and records a time when Wyoming was covered by a shallow inland sea. Thus its fossils are likely to be of marine creatures. We head off in the SUV along a rutted track to a nearby ridge. To go back in time in the Jurassic we must descend, and that means clambering down the steepest of inclines. Almost immediately the heat hits us. The south-facing slope has been soaking up the Sun and even though it's only 11 in the morning, we feel now as though we're being roasted from below and above. After a few minutes, we break our downward slide and catch breath on a level platform of rock. Tim Ewin, an invertebrate specialist with the NHM, walks up and drops something shocking into our hands. A pile of bullets. It can't be! And fortunately that instant fear quickly gives way to relief. The dark ""ammunition"" we're holding is actually belemnites - the fossil remains of squid-like creatures that swam in great abundance in the Sundance Sea 160-170 million years ago. How abundant? We look around and realise the ground is littered with them. They're everywhere. And it's not just belemnites. We're directed also to the distinctive shape of ""devil's toenails"", or Gryphaea to use their scientific name. These were ancient oysters whose fossilised shells resemble satanic nail clippings. We carry on down the slope to where Mark has removed a tarpaulin from a tangled mass of fossil bones. It's a ""sea dragon"", also referred to as an ichthyosaur, a hugely successful marine reptile that looked a bit like a large dolphin. It would have dined on the aforementioned belemnites. The NHM man can't hide his irritation, though. This specimen has been badly damaged at some point by fossil thieves who clearly tried to remove the bones in a hurry and made a dreadful hash of it. ""It's one of the worst examples of privateering you'll see,"" he says. Nonetheless, this incomplete specimen may yet hold valuable science. It will be extracted (properly) and examined for clues as to how it lived and died. Ichthyosaurs gave birth to live young. If this was a pregnant female, her progeny may have been fossilised with her. But as fascinating as the sea dragon is, it's not the reason we've suffered the drop into this oppressive heat trap. That's another 20-30m further on, and when we arrive at the next ledge we find Richard Herrington, the NHM's head of Earth sciences, already gently prising apart delicate sheets of rock with a bayonet. Mark puts a grey slab at our feet and opens his palms. As he does so, the slab splays, its individual layers separating like the paper pages in a book.   These lithographic limestone and mudstone layers represent the sediments that settled at the bottom of an ancient, hyper-saline lagoon. Any animals that swam into, or fell into, this shallow pool probably suffocated in its quiet, super-salty, oxygen-poor waters. It's a setting however that makes for truly remarkable preservation and the entire Mission Jurassic consortium is especially excited about the potential of these particular fossil beds. Already insects and plants are turning up in these paper-thin layers. Fish too. ""It's amazing. You can see every small bone in life position; their scales and fins as well,"" enthuses Tim Ewin. The scientists say the deposits remind them of the famous Solnhofen limestones from southern Germany which have yielded some of the most spectacular of all Late Jurassic fossils, including one of palaeontology's true ""rock stars"" - Archaeopteryx, the winged creature that essentially proved the evolutionary link between dinosaurs and birds. Could these Wyoming sediments hold something similar? For the NHM and Naturalis, there is now great desire to join the Children's Museum in making a long-term commitment to this square mile of Badlands. The possibilities seem overwhelming. The London institution is talking of opening its own dedicated quarry where students could be brought over for training, even museum donors to see where their money is going. ""It would be an important statement from us that we still do expeditions; we still do 'live' science,"" says Richard Herrington. ""We want to say loudly that we're collecting new stuff, not just working on old material. We're modern and we're addressing the latest research questions."" Back up at one of the quarries, Phil Manning is turning a large crystal lump in his hands. When bone has been in the ground for a long time, its calcium is liberated into the surrounding sediments to form gypsum. Finding chunks of the mineral is a sign that more dinosaur remains are close.But at this precise moment, the Manchester man is very excited because his team has just had a eureka moment. Looking at the melange of sauropod fossils in front of them, it’s clear now how the different pieces fit together to make a massive pelvis. “Do you know, fear was what I felt when I first walked on to this site because I realised we were getting into something really huge. But it's something we just have to do because the material is so wonderful. ""Every single palaeontologist from every museum and every university who comes to work here will dream about this place at night.” Publication date: 15 August 2019 ",Negative,0.077318564
"The British overseas territory of Gibraltar, a limestone outcrop on the southern tip of the Iberian peninsula, occupies a commanding position at the western gateway to the Mediterranean Sea. Spain continues to claim sovereignty over the territory, which has been ruled by Britain since 1713 under the terms of the Treaty of Utrecht. Named in Arabic ""Jabal Tariq"", after the Muslim commander Tariq Ibn-Ziyad, who turned ""the Rock"" into a fortress in 711, Gibraltar has been an important naval base for more than 1,000 years. This long maritime history has resulted in a diverse population. Most Gibraltarians are bilingual in English and Spanish, and are of mixed Genoese, British, Spanish, Jewish, Maltese and Portuguese descent. Recent arrivals have included migrant workers from Morocco.

He heads the Gibraltar Socialist Labour Party. Mr Picardo was born in Gibraltar in 1972 and studied law at Oxford University. After graduating from Oxford, he attended the Inns of Court School of Law at Gray's Inn in London. Mr Picardo's predecessor as chief minister, Peter Caruana, held the post for more than 15 years, from 1996 to 2011. Mr Caruana strongly opposes the idea of shared sovereignty with Spain and oversaw a 2002 referendum that roundly rejected the concept. He has been credited with helping to develop Gibraltar's offshore financial industry. In 2010, he said his government was transforming the economy from a European tax haven to a financial services hub. Gibraltarians are British citizens. It is self-governing in all areas except defence and foreign policy and is home to a British military garrison and naval base. The UN has urged Spain and Britain to resolve the issue of Gibraltar's status. Both sides, under the Brussels Process launched in 1984, have attempted to reach an agreement. But Spain's insistence on eventually acquiring full sovereignty, and Britain's determination to retain full control of Gibraltar's military base, have been among the stumbling blocks. Gibraltar's 1969 constitution states that there can be no transfer of sovereignty to Spain against the wishes of locals. In a 2002 referendum Gibraltarians resoundingly rejected the idea of joint sovereignty. Free travel between Spain and Gibraltar was fully restored in 1985, but travellers continued to suffer delays at the border. In 2006, passenger flights between Spain and Gibraltar resumed for the first time in nearly 30 years, but 2013 saw renewed border checks by Spain in response to a Gibraltarian plan to build an artificial reef. Television and radio services on the Rock are operated by the Gibraltar Broadcasting Corporation (GBC). Radio and TV stations based in Spain, and broadcasts for British forces in the territory, can be received. Read full media profile Much of Gibraltar's income comes from customs duties, offshore finance, internet gaming, tourism and the provisioning of ships Some key dates in Gibraltar's history: 711- Gibraltar captured by Muslim commander Tariq Ibn-Ziyad. 1462- Spain recovers Gibraltar from the Moors. 1501- Isabella I, queen of Castile and Aragon, annexes Gibraltar to Spain. 1704- English capture Gibraltar during War of Spanish Succession. 1713- Spain cedes Gibraltar to Britain under the Treaty of Utrecht. 1830- Britain designates Gibraltar a British crown colony. 1940- Civilian population temporarily evacuated to make Gibraltar a military fortress during the World War Two. Discontent at the slow pace of repatriation after the war becomes one of the sources of demands for self-government. 1950- First Legislative Council convened. 1963- Spanish government begins a campaign through UN for the handover of Gibraltar to Spain. 1967- Gibraltarians vote resoundingly in favour of continued British sovereignty in referendum. 1969- Britain introduces full internal self-government under a new constitution, with an elected House of Assembly. Spain closes border with Gibraltar, withdraws labour force and cuts transport and communication links in protest. 1973- Gibraltar joins the European Economic Community alongside Britain. 1980- Lisbon agreement between UK and Spain initiates the gradual re-establishment of talks over Gibraltar. 1981- Gibraltarians granted full British citizenship after a campaign against the British Nationality Act, which had proposed removing their right of entry to Britain. 1984- Britain and Spain agree to provide equal rights for Spaniards in Gibraltar and for Gibraltarians in Spain. Free border crossing between Spain and Gibraltar is restored. 2002- Referendum reaffirms almost total Gibraltarian opposition to UK proposals for joint British-Spanish sovereignty. UK reaffirms that no decision on Gibraltar's future will be made without the consent of Gibraltarians. 2004- Gibraltar marks the 300th anniversary of the establishment of British rule. 2006- Britain, Spain and Gibraltar sign a landmark agreement under which border controls are further eased. Spain agrees to allows flights to Gibraltar's airport. The deal makes no mention of sovereignty. 2006- Voters back a new constitution in referendum confirming Gibraltarian home rule, and renaming the House of Assembly the Parliament of Gibraltar. 2009- Spanish Foreign Minister Miguel Angel Moratinos visits Gibraltar,  the first visit by a Spanish minister since Britain captured the Rock. 2014- Declassified documents show former King Juan Carlos of Spain told Britain in 1982 that it was not in his country's ""interest to recover Gibraltar in the near future"" as it would trigger Moroccan claims to the Spanish territories of Ceuta and Melilla. 2016- UK referendum on EU membership, 96% of Gibraltarians vote to remain. Turnout is 84%. 2020- UK and Gibraltar leave the EU. UK and Spain agree in principle to a basis on which the UK and the EU could negotiate terms for Gibraltar to participate some aspects of the Schengen Agreement to ease border movements.

"Liu Xiaoming, China's ambassador to the UK, made the remarks during a press conference China's ambassador to the UK has warned British politicians against interfering in Hong Kong's affairs, amid clashes between protesters and police. Liu Xiaoming said the UK should ""refrain from saying or doing anything that interferes or undermines the rule of law in Hong Kong"". Some British politicians think ""their hands are still in the colonial days"", he told a press conference in London. The UK has called for ""calm from all sides"". Millions of Hong Kong citizens have taken part in 10 weeks of anti-government protests, demanding democratic reform and an investigation into alleged police brutality. While many of the demonstrations were peaceful, an increasing number have ended in violent clashes with police. The background you need on the Hong Kong protests China labels HK protests as 'near terrorism' Trump suggests 'personal meeting' with China's Xi Mr Liu's warning comes days after the Chinese foreign ministry told Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab to stop interfering in Hong Kong's affairs. He accused some British politicians of viewing Hong Kong as ""part of the British empire"". He made the comment in response to a question about a proposal by Commons Foreign Affairs Select Committee chairman Tom Tugendhat to extend UK citizenship rights to Hong Kong Chinese. ""I think some of them still regard Hong Kong as part of British empire and they treat Hong Kong as part of the UK,"" Mr Liu said. ""They are going to have to change their mindset, put them in the proper position and regard Hong Kong as a part of China, not as a part of the UK,"" he added. By James Robbins, BBC diplomatic correspondent China's Ambassador in London was forthright and uncompromising. Liu Xiaoming can be relied on by Beijing to deliver strong messages in the clearest of English. He is proud of having served in London for almost 10 years, since Gordon Brown was prime minister. Now he is warning that Beijing is ready to intervene in Hong Kong with its own security forces if China judges that necessary ""to quell the unrest swiftly"". He is broadening complaints of foreign interference - talking of unnamed ""foreign forces"" and accusing Britain in particular of interference in what he regards as purely a Chinese internal matter. British government pressure for substantial dialogue in Hong Kong is simply rejected. British politicians are dismissed as continuing to live in their imperial past. But any deployment of Chinese military police or other security forces over the border and into Hong Kong would be a huge and risky step - posing its own threat to the strictly limited autonomy of Hong Kong, which foreign investors and traders still clearly value highly. So, for now, the warning remains just that. Hong Kong, which was a British colony until 1997, is a special administrative region of China, giving it greater independence. The Sino-British Joint Declaration signed in 1984 said Hong Kong would enjoy a ""high degree of autonomy, except in foreign and defence affairs"" and be ""vested with executive, legislative and independent judicial power"". Mr Liu questioned whether the government would allow protesters to commit ""crimes"" in the UK. ""Would the UK allow extremists to storm the Palace of Westminster and damage its facilities and get away with it?"" he said. ""Would the UK give permission for attacking police officers with lethal weapons or set fire to police stations without any punishment? ""Would the UK allow so-called pro-democracy rioters to occupy the airport, obstruct traffic, disturb social order or threaten the safety and people's life and property? ""Aren't all these regarded as crimes in the UK?"" In recent weeks protesters have stormed the Chinese government office in Hong Kong and defaced the national emblem, and also laid siege to police stations. Some protesters argue they have been forced to resort to more confrontational tactics, as peaceful protests have not worked. Mr Liu also condemned unnamed ""Western politicians and organisations"" for lending ""support to violent radicals"" and trying to ""obstruct Hong Kong's police from bringing the violent offenders to justice"". ""Foreign forces must stop interfering in Hong Kong's affairs,"" he said. ""Evidence shows that the situation in Hong Kong would not have deteriorated so much if it had not been for the interference and incitement of foreign forces."" Activists in Hong Kong have denied that foreign governments are involved in the movement, while observers say the protests have largely appeared leaderless and unpredictable. This video can not be played Comedian Bill Bailey witnesses ""chaos"" at Hong Kong airport during the protests on 13 August The protests initially started after Hong Kong introduced a bill in April that would allow those accused of crimes against mainland China to be extradited there. The bill's critics said the move could endanger activists and journalists, and result in those accused facing unfair trials and violent treatment. The bill was suspended in June after hundreds of people took to the streets in protest. The protesters have since called for thecomplete withdrawal of the extradition bill and for other democratic reforms, including amnesty for all arrested activists.

"Zippy Duvall has been a farmer for 34 years The UK must accept US food standards as part of any future trade deal with Washington, the head of America's farming lobby has said. Zippy Duvall, head of the American Farm Bureau, said US farmers were keen to trade with their British ""friends"". But he said fears over practices such as washing chicken in chlorine and using genetically modified (GM) crops were not ""science-based"". The US has said the UK will be""first in line"" for a trade deal after Brexit. But some fear the UK will have to compromise on standards currently enshrined in EU law in order to secure a deal with Washington. This video can not be played How would a no-deal Brexit affect your chicken dinner? Mr Duvall, himself a poultry farmer in Georgia, said he wanted to have ""a conversation"" about US food standards given the concerns in the UK. UK 'first in line' for US trade deal, says Bolton How safe is chlorine-washed chicken? One of the most controversial practices is washing chicken with chlorine to kill germs, which is banned in the EU. This is not because the wash itself is harmful but over fears that treating meat with chlorine at the end allows poorer hygiene elsewhere in the production process. ""You know, here in America we treat our water with chlorine,"" Mr Duvall told the BBC's Today programme. ""So there is no scientific basis that says that washing poultry with a chlorine wash just to be safe of whatever pathogens might be on that chicken as it was prepared for the market, should be taken away. ""If there was something wrong with it our federal inspection systems would not be allowing us to use that,"" he added. In London this week, Donald Trump's national security advisor John Bolton suggested that the US could strike trade deals with the UK after Brexit on a ""sector-by -sector basis"" to speed up the process. But asked whether he could envisage a trade deal with the UK that did not include agriculture, Mr Duvall said it would be seen as a betrayal by US farmers. ""To have a trade treaty and not discuss agriculture would be turning your back on rural America and that's where a big part of our population lives."" John Bolton said the UK would be ""first in line"" for a trade deal after Brexit. He also dismissed concerns that a deal would expose British farmers to harmful competition from much larger US farms with lower production costs. Mr Duvall said the British public should have the right to buy cheaper US produce if they wanted to. ""A lot of our farmers don't understand why other countries implement tariffs on our products but then they don't want us to implement any tariffs on our end, so we need to level that playing field, tear down all those barriers and let our people be able to make the choice of what food they want to eat and where it's grown at."" Separately, Mr Duvall said that President Donald Trump's trade war with China had created the ""perfect storm"" for US farmers, who were already suffering after a series of natural disasters devastated crops in some areas. Since 2018, the US and China have slapped tariffs on billions of dollars' worth of each other's goods and Beijing has specifically targeted US agricultural products such as soya beans. It has led to a sharp drop in US farm exports to China and forced the Trump administration to pay subsidies to support American farmers. . However, Mr Duvall told the BBC that despite this, US farmers still supported Mr Trump's approach to China and viewed the ""short term pain"" as worth it. ""Historically, even though agriculture and trade have been growing all around the world it hasn't kept up to the pace that it should have as the middle class have been rising up, especially in Asia, and we think that we ought to have the opportunity to have a bigger piece of that market,"" he said. ""[US farmers] all will tell you that... they still support the president in his efforts to come up with fair trade for the farmers here in America.""

"Results day can be nerve-wracking. A year on, BBC News apprentice Paige Neal-Holder shares her experience and a few tips for getting through the day. It's been a year since I nervously walked into school to receive my A-level results. I was neither ecstatic nor disappointed. I didn't quite get what I had hoped for but I was just glad I had passed and somehow got through all the stress without tearing my hair out. One thing I wish I had done that day was to be proud of myself regardless of my grades. It was a shame I couldn't recognise my achievement. A year later, I look back differently at my time doing A-levels. A-levels are undoubtedly an important, useful and well recognised qualification that can help launch you into the next chapter of your life - be it university or employment. But at the same time, an individual's mental health and wellbeing is even more important. I can't stress that enough. No-one should break themselves over something that is essentially a letter on a piece of paper. And my A-level certificates are probably collecting dust - I haven't even picked them up from my school yet. It may not seem like it at the time - but if results day doesn't go to plan, it's not the end of the world. You might be screaming: ""Yes it is!"" at your screen right now. It's safe to say I didn't look like this on results day But things do have a way of working themselves out. One year later, I'm not doing too badly. In fact, I didn't need A-level grades for thisBBC apprenticeship. The recruiters were looking for a candidate with five GCSEs and some potential. So, although this is probably not what you want to hear when you have your heart set on one particular option, there may be other options you have not even considered. For what it's worth, here are my top pieces of advice for the big day. Get into school early - if there are any issues you can sort them out as soon as possible Stick close to your friends  - this is not a bad idea whether you are celebrating your results or whether you need a bit of cheering up and extra support Don't compare and despair Be flexible - remember there are lots of options you may not have thought of yet Pat yourself on the back no matter how you have done. Don't beat yourself up. And finally, please do not be the annoying kid who goes around asking what grades people got - because your invite to the future school reunion may accidentally on purpose get lost in the post.

"Details of A-level grade boundaries for all papers set by two exam boards have been leaked on social media a day before the results are published. The documents reveal that A-level maths candidates needed little more than half marks to get a grade A in papers set by both Pearson/Edexcel and OCR. Exam boards send marking schemes to schools in confidence ahead of the results to help them prepare students. They said confidentiality was usually respected. A-level students are due to get their results on Thursday. The leaked Edexcel documents,first reported in the Daily Telegraph,external, show A-level maths candidates needed 55% to get the A grade, while candidates with the OCR board needed 54%. Edexcel's biology students needed 56% (167 marks out of 300) for an A, while OCR's candidates needed 59% (158 out of 270). In physics, candidates needed 59% (176 out of 300) for a grade A with Edexcel, while with OCR, this was 76% (204 out of 270). In English literature, candidates with the OCR board needed 89% for an A grade - significantly higher than those with Edexcel, who needed 69% (208 marks out of 300) to get A. This summer is the first time that grades for new-specification A-level maths are being awarded to the vast majority of students. The exam was reported by students to be very challenging, but the exam board had said before the leak emerged that it was clear the paper was of an appropriate standard. Exam boards set grade boundaries once all the results are in. They take into account the predicted achievement levels of the cohort taking the exam and the difficulty of the paper, in an attempt to keep standards the same from year to year. Responding to the leak, a spokesman for Pearson said: ""Our systems are working as they should and the information was shared today via a password-protected, secure website. ""Boards do ask schools not to share this widely to avoid unnecessary stress for students awaiting their results. ""Schools are trusted to treat the info confidentially on behalf of their students - and the vast majority do."" Investigation after A-level paper leaked 'I cried in the car on the way home' A spokesman for Cambridge Assessment, which owns the OCR board, said: ""We provide schools and colleges with results information, including grade boundaries, the day before results day on a special site which is accessible to exams officers. ""Grade boundaries are then released by schools to their students on results day and we publish them on our website. ""We do it this way to minimise the chance of students feeling anxious if they see grade boundaries without their results â which can lead some to jump to the wrong conclusion."" General secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders Geoff Barton said: ""We are extremely disappointed if grade boundaries have been leaked ahead of results day."" But he said was a pointless exercise because the purpose of grade boundaries was to account for differences in the difficulty of papers so that students were not disadvantaged from one year to the next. ""We would urge students against losing sleep over grade boundaries and to wait for their results tomorrow.""

"The government has confirmed it will scrap more than 200 vocational qualifications, including BTecs. BTec qualifications are A-level equivalents, aimed at people interested in working in a particular industry, such as engineering, hospitality or childcare. A BTec, which stands for the Business and Technology Education Council, is a practical qualification. Courses are assessed through exams, regular coursework and projects, and sometimes placements. BTec Firsts are Level 2 qualifications, meaning they are equivalent to GCSEs. Students often take a mixture of the two. They can be helpful for people trying to get into further education colleges. BTec Nationals are Level 3 qualifications, so can be taken alongside or instead of A-levels. They are studied over one or two years. Research suggests,externalone in four students use them as a route into university, while others gain occupation-specific skills and go straight into employment. BTecs are graded on a scale: Starred Distinction/Distinction Star (D*) Distinction (D) Merit (M) Pass (P) Some BTecs are worth two or three A-levels. Students normally receive their results on the same days as A-level and GCSE students, but some receive them before this. There are approximately 280,000 students studying at least one Level 3 applied general qualification, according to the Sixth Form College Association. A further 200,000 are estimated to be doing BTec Firsts and other BTec qualifications. Health and social care and applied science are among the most popular BTecs. Other subjects include construction, electrical engineering and art and design. BTec Nationals can be sat by any age group. In fact,most are taken by those over the age of 22,externalas they develop practical career skills. They are particularly popular among white working class students, according toresearch by the Social Market Foundation,externalthink tank. Other vocational courses are available in the UK, includingNational Vocational Qualifications,external(NVQs),TechBacs,external,Cambridge Technicals,externalandScottish Vocational Qualifications,external(SVQs). BTec results normally come out on the same days as A-level and GCSE results In 2020, there were more than 12,000 vocational qualifications at all levels, offered by more than 150 awarding bodies, according to Ofqual, which oversees qualifications in England. Plans by former Conservative governments to streamline post-16 education had meant many BTecs and other Level 3 courseswere due to lose their funding, to make way for the newT-levelsqualification. However, the Labour government paused and reviewed the plans, and has since announced that 157 qualifications will no longer be scrapped as planned. They include""key courses"" in ""important sectors"",external, the DfE said, such as agriculture, engineering, manufacturing and health and social care. Some have had funding confirmed until July 2026 and others until July 2027. The government also confirmed that more than 200 qualifications with ""with low or no enrolments"" would still have funding withdrawn from 1 August 2025. Sarah Hannafin, head of policy at school leaders' union NAHT, said the announcement provided ""much-needed clarity"" for schools and colleges. ""The ambition of the previous government for A-levels and T-levels to be the only two qualification pathways post-16 would have failed to meet the needs and ambitions of many students,"" she added. The government has confirmed the rollout of T-levels will continue. In the first three years, T-levels have faced delays, high dropout rates andan exam board being fined Â£300,000over ""major failings"" with the papers.

"Chicken boxes featuring warnings about the dangers of carrying a knife have been sent to takeaways in England and Wales as part of a government campaign. More than 321,000 boxes will replace standard packaging at outlets including Chicken Cottage, Dixy Chicken and Morley's, the Home Office said. Real life stories of young people who chose positive activities over carrying a weapon are printed inside the boxes. Shadow home secretary Diane Abbott said the plan was ""crude"" and ""offensive"". However, Home Secretary Priti Patel defended the campaign, accusing Ms Abbott of ""playing politics with knife crime"". The key facts about rising knife crime 'Thousands' of 14-year-olds carry knives Printed inside the special boxes, part of the Home Office's #knifefree campaign, are first-hand accounts of young people who have opted to pursue pastimes such as boxing or music instead of carrying a knife. Both independent and branch-owned chicken shops will carry the new boxes, and many will also house digital screens highlighting the campaign. Policing Minister Kit Malthouse says they ""will bring home to thousands of young people the tragic consequences of carrying a knife and challenge the idea that it makes you safer"". But the government has been accused of racial stereotyping. David Lammy, Labour MP for Tottenham,wrote on Twitter,external: ""Is this some kind of joke?! Why have you chosen chicken shops? What's next, #KnifeFree watermelons?"" Dal Babu, a former chief superintendent with the Metropolitan Police, said: ""This initiative seeks to target chicken shops because the assumption is that's where young black people go. ""There's a racial element to it - it stereotypes people, it's patronising and I can understand why people see it as racist."" Ms Abbotttweeted,external: ""Instead of investing in a public health approach to violent crime, the Home Office have opted for yet another crude, offensive and probably expensive campaign. ""They would do better to invest in our communities not demonise them."" Courtney Barrett, who runs his own knife amnesty in east London told BBC News the scheme was a ""step in the right direction"" but stressed that it should not just involve chicken shops. ""The public need to be made aware not all knife crime is carried out by young people, black people and gangs,"" the founder of Binning Knives Saves Lives said. Recent figuresshowed most perpetrators of knife crime were over the age of 18. The special boxes feature real life stories of young people Meanwhile, Patsy McKie, who founded Mothers Against Violence in Manchester after her son was shot dead, said sharing stories in this way was not enough to discourage young people from carrying knives. ""Just putting it on a box isn't going to stop it,"" she said. ""Someone who is carrying a knife to feel safe isn't going to put it down."" Ms McKie added: ""You often have to go through an experience to change your views."" Peter Grigg, director of external affairs at the Children's Society, is urging more government investment ""in education for young people about knife crime"" as well as in ""early intervention and prevention"".

"Emma McNulty described the death of Millie as like ""losing a member of the family"" A woman who says she was sacked on the same day her family dog died has started a campaign for bereavement leave when employees lose their pets. Emma McNulty, from Glasgow, said she was too upset to work after her terrier Millie died at the weekend. She claims she was physically sick with grief, but the 18-year-old student was told to find cover or risk dismissal. Unable to find a replacement, she said her part-time job in a sandwich shop was terminated. Ms McNulty described the death of Millie as like ""losing a member of the family"". She has started a petition asking for employers to recognise pet bereavement in the same way as a human family member. Her online change.org petition has already gained more than 700 supporters. ""I was sacked on the same day as I lost my dog,"" she said. ""Millie was 14 and I am 18, so I don't remember a time when she wasn't part of my life. ""We did everything together. I was so close to her and she was my best pal."" Emma McNulty's beloved per Millie died unexpectedly Ms McNulty added: ""She became ill on Saturday night and we had to have her put to sleep on Sunday. I was devastated, distraught and physically sick. ""I thought my employer would show a bit of compassion. Instead I was told to find cover and that if I didn't come in I would risk dismissal. ""When I told them I couldn't find a replacement I was told not to show up for any other shifts and that the boss would be in touch."" Ms McNulty said she was dismissed for not turning up for a planned shift. Since starting her online petition she has received dozens of messages of support. Daniel Taylor wrote: ""Dogs are family. You should be allowed to grieve for them too."" Tracy Rawding added: ""Pets are family members and the grief is very real."" And Geraldine Kennedy posted: ""This is no different to losing a human family member. Our animals mean more to us than our human family and we should be allowed the same time to grieve their loss."" Inseparable: Millie and Emma McNulty Arbitration service Acas has producedguidance for employers around bereavement,external. It says: ""Grief impacts on the emotional, physical, spiritual and psychological well-being of the person who is bereaved. At any time research indicates one in 10 employees is likely to be affected by bereavement. ""Bereavement in the workplace can be challenging to manage: employees may need to take time off unexpectedly; find their performance is impacted, or be temporarily unable to perform certain roles. ""However, a compassionate and supportive approach demonstrates that the organisation values its employees, helps build commitment, reduce sickness absence, and retain the workforce."" Diane James, pet bereavement support service manager at Blue Cross, said: ""We fully support understanding employers who offer bereavement leave to allow time for pet owners to come to terms with their loss. ""We have been helping pet owners for 25 years and are contacted by over 12,000 devastated pet owners every year who are struggling to cope."" As an employee, you have a right to time off to deal with an emergency involving a dependant. A dependant could be a spouse, partner, child, grandchild, parent, or someone who depends on you for care. However, it is unlikely a pet would be included in this benefit. According to the UK government website, compassionate leave can be granted by an employer as paid or unpaid leave for emergency situations. However, this is at the discretion of the employer. The site advises checking your employment contract, company handbook or intranet for details about the company's policy on compassionate leave. A spokesman for Acas said: ""The law gives a day one right for an employee to have reasonable time off work to deal with a bereavement involving a dependant. ""Bereavement is a very personal issue and can affect different people in different ways. ""Pets are not specifically mentioned within workplace bereavement legislation but the death of a beloved pet can impact a worker's mental health and a good employer should be sensitive and mindful of their employees' wellbeing.""

"Mr Trump has said Mr Xi could bring about a ""happy and enlightened ending"" by meeting protesters US President Donald Trump has urged his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping to meet protesters in Hong Kong who have been demanding democratic reforms. Hong Kong has been in turmoil for weeks, with protesters causing chaos at the airport earlier this week. Mr Trump had previously appeared to suggest that he himself should meet Mr Xi to discuss the crisis in the city. Millions of Hong Kong citizens have taken part in 10 weeks of anti-government protests. Brand 'witch hunt' takes over Chinese internet How could China intervene in Hong Kong protests? Also on Thursday, the Chinese ambassador to the UK warned that Beijing would intervene in Hong Kong if events deteriorated further. He said the territory was facing its gravest situation since it was handed back from the UK to China in 1997. The tumultuous pro-democracy protests were sparked by opposition to a bill that would have allowed extraditions from Hong Kong to mainland China. Allow Twitter content?

In an earlier tweet, Mr Trump said he had ""ZERO doubt"" that Mr Xi could ""humanely solve the Hong Kong problem"". He also tied the protests to a US trade deal with Beijing, in the face of ongoing trade tensions. In pictures: Hong Kong protesters occupy terminal Hong Kong protests in 300 words ""Of course China wants to make a deal. Let them work humanely with Hong Kong first!"" he tweeted. The controversial extradition bill has now been suspended, but the protests have evolved into a broader movement, with demonstrators expressing anger at alleged police brutality, and demanding democratic reform. Hong Kong, a former British colony, is part of China under a ""one country, two systems"" model that grants it a high level of autonomy. It has its own legal system and judiciary and enjoys certain freedoms not seen in the mainland - Hong Kong and Macau for example, are the only places in Chinese territory where people can hold vigils commemorating the 1989 Tiananmen Square crackdown. Analysis by Zhaoyin Feng, US Correspondent, BBC Chinese Service It's highly unlikely that President Xi of China will meet the Hong Kong protesters. Beijing has labelled them as ""rioters with behaviour that is close to terrorism"". It would be difficult for the Chinese government to justify a meeting between its leader and the ""rioters"". Also, the protests have had no obvious leaders who can potentially lead a negotiation with Beijing. More importantly, a meeting between Mr Xi and protesters would look too much like the one between the then Chinese Premier Li Peng and student leaders in May 1989 during the Tiananmen uprising. Li Peng's meeting, where he refused to withdraw the ""riot"" definition of the student movement, was fruitless at best. Li, later known as the ""Butcher of Beijing"", was believed to have supported the violent crackdown two weeks after the meeting. The Chinese government would not want to remind the world about this piece of history. Clashes between demonstrators and police have escalated in recent days, with Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam warning the city could be ""pushed into an abyss"". Separately, the US president's national security advisor, John Bolton, warned China on Wednesday to tread ""carefully"" in Hong Kong ""because people in America remember Tiananmen Square"". A repeat of the military crackdown on the 1989 student-led protests inChina would be a ""big mistake"", he told news outlet Voice of America,external. China's ambassador to the UK, Liu Xiaoming, said Hong Kong was at a ""critical moment"". ""Should the situation in Hong Kong deteriorate further... the central government will not sit on its hands and watch,"" he said at a press conference in London. ""We have enough solutions and enough power within the limits of (the) Basic Law to quell any unrest swiftly,"" Mr Liu added. Demonstrators are now using laser pointers as a sign of protest Relations between protesters and police, already tense, have worsened in recent days.

Hong Kong protesters turn to Uber and Pokemon While China's People's Liberation Army (PLA) has troops stationed in Hong Kong, they are not expected to interfere in local issues.

"Emma McNulty described the death of Millie as like ""losing a member of the family"" A woman who says she was sacked on the same day her family dog died has started a campaign for bereavement leave when employees lose their pets. Emma McNulty, from Glasgow, said she was too upset to work after her terrier Millie died at the weekend. She claims she was physically sick with grief, but the 18-year-old student was told to find cover or risk dismissal. Unable to find a replacement, she said her part-time job in a sandwich shop was terminated. Ms McNulty described the death of Millie as like ""losing a member of the family"". She has started a petition asking for employers to recognise pet bereavement in the same way as a human family member. Her online change.org petition has already gained more than 700 supporters. ""I was sacked on the same day as I lost my dog,"" she said. ""Millie was 14 and I am 18, so I don't remember a time when she wasn't part of my life. ""We did everything together. I was so close to her and she was my best pal."" Emma McNulty's beloved per Millie died unexpectedly Ms McNulty added: ""She became ill on Saturday night and we had to have her put to sleep on Sunday. I was devastated, distraught and physically sick. ""I thought my employer would show a bit of compassion. Instead I was told to find cover and that if I didn't come in I would risk dismissal. ""When I told them I couldn't find a replacement I was told not to show up for any other shifts and that the boss would be in touch."" Ms McNulty said she was dismissed for not turning up for a planned shift. Since starting her online petition she has received dozens of messages of support. Daniel Taylor wrote: ""Dogs are family. You should be allowed to grieve for them too."" Tracy Rawding added: ""Pets are family members and the grief is very real."" And Geraldine Kennedy posted: ""This is no different to losing a human family member. Our animals mean more to us than our human family and we should be allowed the same time to grieve their loss."" Inseparable: Millie and Emma McNulty Arbitration service Acas has producedguidance for employers around bereavement,external. It says: ""Grief impacts on the emotional, physical, spiritual and psychological well-being of the person who is bereaved. At any time research indicates one in 10 employees is likely to be affected by bereavement. ""Bereavement in the workplace can be challenging to manage: employees may need to take time off unexpectedly; find their performance is impacted, or be temporarily unable to perform certain roles. ""However, a compassionate and supportive approach demonstrates that the organisation values its employees, helps build commitment, reduce sickness absence, and retain the workforce."" Diane James, pet bereavement support service manager at Blue Cross, said: ""We fully support understanding employers who offer bereavement leave to allow time for pet owners to come to terms with their loss. ""We have been helping pet owners for 25 years and are contacted by over 12,000 devastated pet owners every year who are struggling to cope.""

"More than 40% of under-18s didn't visit an NHS dentist last year, figures show Dental surgeons are calling for the government in England to encourage all schools to go sugar-free in a bid to combat tooth decay. They say it is essential to cut sugar in school meals to tackle a condition affecting a quarter of five-year-olds. Dentists also want more supervised teeth-brushing in schools and guidelines on healthy packed lunches. Before leaving Downing Street, Prime Minister Theresa May announced plans to improve children's oral health. Her government produceda green paper on tackling the causes of preventable ill health. But the Faculty of Dental Surgery says that while progress has been made, more needs to be done. Tooth decay is the leading cause of hospital admissions among five-to-nine-year-olds over the last three years, its report says. Yet figures show that 41% of under-18s didn't visit an NHS dentist last year. And the figure is 77% among children aged between one and two, despite guidance that all children should see a dentist at least once a year. The faculty has produced a report containing 12 recommendations to try to cut down on cases of tooth decay. These include: all schools in England to introduce supervised teeth-brushing schemes, as exist in Scotland and Wales, before 2022 all schools to become ""sugar-free"" extending the soft-drinks levy to include sugary dairy drinks limiting advertising and promotions for high-sugar products reducing the sugar content of commercial baby foods Prof Michael Escudier, dean of the Faculty of Dental Surgery at the Royal College of Surgeons of England, said: ""It is incredibly worrying that levels of tooth decay among children in England remain so high - especially when you consider that it is almost entirely preventable through simple steps, such as brushing twice a day with appropriate-strength fluoride toothpaste, visiting the dentist regularly and reducing sugar consumption."" He added: ""The scourge of child dental decay cannot be allowed to continue. ""Everyone needs to play their part in ensuring our children have healthy, happy teeth."" The Faculty of Dental Surgery said a campaign to remind people how often to take their children to a dentist, and the availability of free NHS dental care, was needed. The British Dental Association said many parents were not aware that dental check-ups and treatment for under-18s were free. And it called for investment in a national oral health programme for children in England, matching those already set up in Scotland and Wales, to help children develop good habits from an early age. BDA chairman Mick Armstrong said: ""It's a scandal that tooth decay remains the number one reason for child hospital admissions. ""We will not see real progress until ministers start going further and faster on prevention."" The Department for Education said schools in England had to provide pupils with a nutritious school meal and restrict foods high in sugar from lunch options.

"This video can not be played Power NI customers set for 6% bill increase Almost half a million homes in Northern Ireland will see their electricity bills rise by 6% from October. Power NI, which has 458,000 domestic customers across Northern Ireland, is increasing prices in a move that will add about Â£35 a year to the average household electricity bill. This is the third year in a row that Power NI has hiked its prices. The company said the change, which has been agreed withthe Utility Regulator,external, was due to increased costs. Energy prices to fall for millions this winter It said these had come from the electricity network provider and the market operator. ""Unfortunately, like all suppliers, we have no alternative but to pay these increased network and market charges, which have a knock-on effect on our prices,"" said Stephen McCully, managing director of Power NI. ""Having been through a rigorous process with the Utility Regulator, our customers can be sure that although unwelcome, this increase is as low as possible."" The Consumer Council advises people to shop around for a better deal The Consumer Council described the increase as disappointing. Paulino Garcia, head of energy policy, said the council is concerned about the impact on vulnerable consumers on low incomes. He said the fall in wholesale energy prices over the last three months had not materialised in prices. Mr Garcia added that Power NI and the Utility Regulator assured the council that if wholesale prices continue to fall, the savings will be passed on. The Consumer Council advises bill payers to use theirindependent comparison tool to check if they can make savings,external. It also pointed out that bills can be cut without switching your supplier by setting up a direct debit. Power NI has 35,000 farm and business customers who will also see a rise in their bills, but as many have personalised contracts with either a market tracker or a fixed-price deal, the increase will vary depending on contract type and tariff. Power NI is regulated by the Utility Regulator in Northern Ireland. ""Approving any increase to electricity bills is not a decision we take lightly,"" said Utility Regulator chief executive Jenny Pyper. ""It is disappointing that, due to a number of rising costs, Power NI need to increase their domestic tariff."" ""Despite this increase, Power NI's standard domestic electricity tariff continues to be lower than the Great Britain and Republic of Ireland average,"" she added.

"Preparing for the possibility of a no-deal Brexit should be ""the top priority"" for civil servants, Boris Johnson has told them in a letter. The PM said he would prefer to get a deal with the EU, but he said he recognised this ""may not happen"". Earlier Jeremy Corbyn had urged the UK's top civil servant to intervene to prevent a no-deal Brexit happening during a general election campaign. It comes amid speculation MPs could back a no-confidence motion in the PM. In his letter to civil servants, Mr Johnson said the UK must be prepared to leave the EU by the latest Brexit deadline of 31 October ""whatever the circumstances"". ""That is why preparing urgently and rapidly for the possibility of an exit without a deal will be my top priority, and it will be the top priority for the civil service too."" It is understood that government special advisers also received an email last night from the PM's senior adviser Eddie Lister instructing them not to take annual leave until after 31 October. No deal during election 'anti-democratic' - Corbyn Is it too late to hold an election before Brexit? Javid to HMRC: Make no-deal planning top priority Mr Johnson's message to civil servants follows a similar letter sent by Chancellor Sajid Javid earlier this month to HM Revenue and Customs. Mr Javid also ordered the tax authority to make preparing for no-deal its ""absolute top priority"", including helping the public to prepare for the possibility. He said this should include making sure IT systems are ready, helping businesses with a helpline, and contacting traders directly. In hisletter,externalto Cabinet Secretary Sir Mark Sedwill, Mr Corbyn said it would be an ""anti-democratic abuse of power"" if the PM allowed a no-deal to occur by default during a general election campaign, if the government was defeated in a vote of no confidence. Shadow chancellor John McDonnell has said it is ""almost inevitable"" that Labour would push for such a vote when the Commons returns from its summer recess on 3 September. It is thought MPs opposed to no-deal could back the vote in a bid to prevent the UK leaving the EU without an agreement - leading to a general election being called. Election rules say Parliament should be dissolved 25 working days before polling day - so some people are concerned Mr Johnson could allow a no-deal Brexit to happen while MPs are not sitting. According to the Sunday Telegraph, Mr Johnson's senior adviser at No 10, Dominic Cummings, has told MPs even losing such a vote could not stop the PM taking the UK out of the EU on 31 October. Hereportedly saidMr Johnson could call an election for after the deadline, with Brexit taking place in the meantime. Theresa May's Brexit deal was rejected three times by MPs and, as things stand, the UK will leave the EU on 31 October whether it has agreed a new one or not. Mr Johnson has urged the EU to make changes to the deal, but has said the UK must leave by this deadline with or without an agreement. Many of those who voted against the deal had concerns over the backstop, which if implemented, would see Northern Ireland staying aligned to some rules of the EU single market. This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics. It would also see the UK stay in a single customs territory with the EU, and align with current and future EU rules on competition and state aid. These arrangements would apply unless and until both the EU and UK agreed they were no longer necessary. On Thursday Mr Johnson again urged the EU to compromise on the Irish borderbackstop plan, designed to guarantee there will not be a hard Irish border after Brexit. However, the EU has continued to insist that the withdrawal deal agreed by Mrs May last year, including the backstop, cannot be renegotiated. Meanwhile, a transport minister has said he supports the government position of leaving the EU in all circumstances, following comments he made about a no-deal Brexit. George Freeman toldHuffPost UK's Commons People podcast,externalit would be an ""absolute disaster"" for the UK in the long term if it only traded with the EU on WTO [World Trade Organization] terms, without its own free trade deal with the bloc. But he later tweeted to say he ""totally supports"" the position that the UK should leave with no deal on 31 October, ""if the EU is unwilling to negotiate"". In response, Downing Street told the BBC that Mr Freeman has the ""full support of the prime minister"".

"Mr Trump has said Mr Xi could bring about a ""happy and enlightened ending"" by meeting protesters US President Donald Trump has urged his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping to meet protesters in Hong Kong who have been demanding democratic reforms. Hong Kong has been in turmoil for weeks, with protesters causing chaos at the airport earlier this week. Mr Trump had previously appeared to suggest that he himself should meet Mr Xi to discuss the crisis in the city. Millions of Hong Kong citizens have taken part in 10 weeks of anti-government protests. Brand 'witch hunt' takes over Chinese internet How could China intervene in Hong Kong protests? Also on Thursday, the Chinese ambassador to the UK warned that Beijing would intervene in Hong Kong if events deteriorated further. He said the territory was facing its gravest situation since it was handed back from the UK to China in 1997. The tumultuous pro-democracy protests were sparked by opposition to a bill that would have allowed extraditions from Hong Kong to mainland China. Allow Twitter content?

In an earlier tweet, Mr Trump said he had ""ZERO doubt"" that Mr Xi could ""humanely solve the Hong Kong problem"". He also tied the protests to a US trade deal with Beijing, in the face of ongoing trade tensions. In pictures: Hong Kong protesters occupy terminal Hong Kong protests in 300 words ""Of course China wants to make a deal. Let them work humanely with Hong Kong first!"" he tweeted. The controversial extradition bill has now been suspended, but the protests have evolved into a broader movement, with demonstrators expressing anger at alleged police brutality, and demanding democratic reform. Hong Kong, a former British colony, is part of China under a ""one country, two systems"" model that grants it a high level of autonomy. It has its own legal system and judiciary and enjoys certain freedoms not seen in the mainland - Hong Kong and Macau for example, are the only places in Chinese territory where people can hold vigils commemorating the 1989 Tiananmen Square crackdown. Analysis by Zhaoyin Feng, US Correspondent, BBC Chinese Service It's highly unlikely that President Xi of China will meet the Hong Kong protesters. Beijing has labelled them as ""rioters with behaviour that is close to terrorism"". It would be difficult for the Chinese government to justify a meeting between its leader and the ""rioters"". Also, the protests have had no obvious leaders who can potentially lead a negotiation with Beijing. More importantly, a meeting between Mr Xi and protesters would look too much like the one between the then Chinese Premier Li Peng and student leaders in May 1989 during the Tiananmen uprising. Li Peng's meeting, where he refused to withdraw the ""riot"" definition of the student movement, was fruitless at best. Li, later known as the ""Butcher of Beijing"", was believed to have supported the violent crackdown two weeks after the meeting. The Chinese government would not want to remind the world about this piece of history. Clashes between demonstrators and police have escalated in recent days, with Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam warning the city could be ""pushed into an abyss"". Separately, the US president's national security advisor, John Bolton, warned China on Wednesday to tread ""carefully"" in Hong Kong ""because people in America remember Tiananmen Square"". A repeat of the military crackdown on the 1989 student-led protests inChina would be a ""big mistake"", he told news outlet Voice of America,external. China's ambassador to the UK, Liu Xiaoming, said Hong Kong was at a ""critical moment"". ""Should the situation in Hong Kong deteriorate further... the central government will not sit on its hands and watch,"" he said at a press conference in London. ""We have enough solutions and enough power within the limits of (the) Basic Law to quell any unrest swiftly,"" Mr Liu added. Demonstrators are now using laser pointers as a sign of protest Relations between protesters and police, already tense, have worsened in recent days. On Sunday, police were seen firing pepper ball rounds on protesters at close range and using tear gas in an enclosed train station. On Monday and Tuesday, Hong Kong airport was forced to close after protesters occupied the terminal. They clashed violently with police on Tuesday evening. This video can not be played A police officer draws his gun and aims at protesters in the airport building On Wednesday evening, police armed with riot shields fired tear gas to disperse hundreds of demonstrators who had been shining laser pointers at a police station. They were mocking the police who had arrested a student for possessing laser pointers, which they described as ""offensive weapons"" that could cause eye injuries. Hong Kong protesters turn to Uber and Pokemon While China's People's Liberation Army (PLA) has troops stationed in Hong Kong, they are not expected to interfere in local issues. However, Hong Kong's mini constitution, known as the Basic Law, does allow the government to request the PLA's assistance for maintaining public order, or disaster relief. So far, Hong Kong's government and police have said they have no plans to involve the army. What questions do you have about Hong Kong?

"Zippy Duvall has been a farmer for 34 years The UK must accept US food standards as part of any future trade deal with Washington, the head of America's farming lobby has said. Zippy Duvall, head of the American Farm Bureau, said US farmers were keen to trade with their British ""friends"". But he said fears over practices such as washing chicken in chlorine and using genetically modified (GM) crops were not ""science-based"". The US has said the UK will be""first in line"" for a trade deal after Brexit. But some fear the UK will have to compromise on standards currently enshrined in EU law in order to secure a deal with Washington. This video can not be played How would a no-deal Brexit affect your chicken dinner? Mr Duvall, himself a poultry farmer in Georgia, said he wanted to have ""a conversation"" about US food standards given the concerns in the UK. UK 'first in line' for US trade deal, says Bolton How safe is chlorine-washed chicken? One of the most controversial practices is washing chicken with chlorine to kill germs, which is banned in the EU. This is not because the wash itself is harmful but over fears that treating meat with chlorine at the end allows poorer hygiene elsewhere in the production process. ""You know, here in America we treat our water with chlorine,"" Mr Duvall told the BBC's Today programme. ""So there is no scientific basis that says that washing poultry with a chlorine wash just to be safe of whatever pathogens might be on that chicken as it was prepared for the market, should be taken away. ""If there was something wrong with it our federal inspection systems would not be allowing us to use that,"" he added. In London this week, Donald Trump's national security advisor John Bolton suggested that the US could strike trade deals with the UK after Brexit on a ""sector-by -sector basis"" to speed up the process. But asked whether he could envisage a trade deal with the UK that did not include agriculture, Mr Duvall said it would be seen as a betrayal by US farmers. ""To have a trade treaty and not discuss agriculture would be turning your back on rural America and that's where a big part of our population lives."" John Bolton said the UK would be ""first in line"" for a trade deal after Brexit. He also dismissed concerns that a deal would expose British farmers to harmful competition from much larger US farms with lower production costs. Mr Duvall said the British public should have the right to buy cheaper US produce if they wanted to. ""A lot of our farmers don't understand why other countries implement tariffs on our products but then they don't want us to implement any tariffs on our end, so we need to level that playing field, tear down all those barriers and let our people be able to make the choice of what food they want to eat and where it's grown at."" Separately, Mr Duvall said that President Donald Trump's trade war with China had created the ""perfect storm"" for US farmers, who were already suffering after a series of natural disasters devastated crops in some areas. Since 2018, the US and China have slapped tariffs on billions of dollars' worth of each other's goods and Beijing has specifically targeted US agricultural products such as soya beans. It has led to a sharp drop in US farm exports to China and forced the Trump administration to pay subsidies to support American farmers. . However, Mr Duvall told the BBC that despite this, US farmers still supported Mr Trump's approach to China and viewed the ""short term pain"" as worth it. ""Historically, even though agriculture and trade have been growing all around the world it hasn't kept up to the pace that it should have as the middle class have been rising up, especially in Asia, and we think that we ought to have the opportunity to have a bigger piece of that market,"" he said. ""[US farmers] all will tell you that... they still support the president in his efforts to come up with fair trade for the farmers here in America.""

"Global stock markets fell around the world as concerns about the US-China trade war and the global economy prompted investors to dump shares. The three main US stock markets closed 3% lower overnight, European stocks fell across the board, while Asian stock markets opened lower. Weak data from Germany and China on Wednesday helped fuel a rush for safe assets like bonds and gold. Bond market moves pointed to possible recessions in major economies. The US central bank also came under renewed pressure from US President Donald Trump for not doing enough to support the world's largest economy. There are concerns that renewed attacks by Mr Trump on the Federal Reserve could erode investor confidence on its ability to make independent decisions. Analyst Oliver Pursche, from financial services company Bruderman, said the global picture was precarious. ""What's happening in Hong Kong, what's happening with Brexit and the trade war, it's all a mess,"" the chief market strategist said. ""Every central bank around the world is trying to prop up economies and every politician around the world is trying to destroy economies."" Are markets signalling that a recession is due? German economy slips back into negative growth News that Germany's GDP contracted in the second quarter, and that China's industrial growth in July hit a 17-year low, had already spooked markets in Europe. The FTSE 100 closed more than 1% lower, while in Germany and France the markets finished more than 2% lower. Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 dropped some 2% in early trading on Thursday, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng index opened 1.4% lower. Both later regained some ground.Disruptions related to pro-democracy protests have also weighed on the stock marketin Hong Kong. Another worry was that bond markets are flashing recession warnings. The yield on two-year and 10-year Treasury bonds inverted for the first time since June 2007. This means investor appetite for safety is such that they are willing to get lower returns for holding bonds for a longer period. Usually investors demand higher returns for holding bonds for longer due to the risks involved with parking your money away for a long time. Historically, such bond movements have been a reliable indicator of possible recessions, and preceded the last global downturn more than 10 years ago. The UK bond yield curve also inverted for the first time since 2008, while the yield gap between 10-year and 2-year German government bonds was at its tightest since the financial crisis. Meanwhile, the CBOE volatility index - the so-called fear index - jumped higher, and spot gold prices rose. On Wednesday, Mr Trump again attempted to deflect the market turmoil onto the US Federal Reserve and its interest rate policy, calling Fed chief Jerome Powell ""clueless"". In raising interest rates four times last year ""the Federal Reserve acted far too quickly, and now is very, very late"" in cutting borrowing costs, the president tweeted. ""Too bad, so much to gain on the upside!"" Recent presidents have avoided commenting on Fed policy, in a sign of respect for the bank's independence. Michelle Fleury, New York business correspondent The recession signal from the bond market will only heap pressure on the Federal Reserve to give the president what he wants - more rate cuts. Wall Street certainly thinks it's inevitable, pricing in a cut in September. Last month, America's central bank reduced its benchmark interest rate for the first time since 2008. That failed to impress Donald Trump who berated Fed Chair Jay Powell for not cutting rates quickly enough. And as the havoc on the financial markets was unfolding, President Trump was back on twitter defending his administration's tariff war with China and attacking the Fed, calling the chairman clueless. But if Mr Trump gets what he wants, it may come at a steep price. The Fed's recent rate cut didn't buoy the markets like it used to. So it's not clear that more rate cuts will blunt the damage from his ongoing trade war with China which is creating uncertainty and raising costs for businesses and consumers. Earlier on Wednesday, White House trade adviser Peter Navarro told Fox Business Network the central bank should cut rates by half a percentage point ""as soon as possible"", an action he claimed would lead to stock markets soaring. Despite the US delaying the 1 September imposition of tariffs on some Chinese imports into the US, it has done little to ease concerns. ""The challenge is that Trump's trade policy has proven so erratic that you cannot relieve the sense of uncertainty,"" said Tim Duy, an economics professor at the University of Oregon. As of September last year, the US central bank had a relatively rosy outlook for the economy, expecting that the stimulus from the Trump administration's massive $1.5tn tax cut package and spending in 2018 would sustain growth and justify steadily higher interest rates. Mr Trump wants to make the economy a central part of his case for his 2020 re-election campaign. In an interview scheduled to air on Fox Business Network on Friday, former Fed chief Janet Yellen said she felt the US economy remained ""strong enough"" to avoid a downturn, but ""the odds have clearly risen and they are higher than I'm frankly comfortable with"".
