"Jeff Bezos's fortune hit a record high this summer Billionaires have seen their fortunes hit record highs during the pandemic, with top executives from technology and industry earning the most. The world's richest saw their wealth climb 27.5% to $10.2trn (Â£7.9trn) from April to July this year, according to a report from Swiss bank UBS. That was up from the previous peak of $8.9trn at the end of 2017 and largely due to rising global share prices. UBS said billionaires had done ""extremely well"" in the Covid crisis. It also said the number of billionaires had hit a new high of 2,189, up from 2,158 in 2017. It comes as a World Bank report on Wednesday showedextreme poverty is set to rise this year for the first time in more than two decadesdue to the pandemic. Among the billionaires, the biggest winners this year have been industrialists, whose wealth rose a staggering 44% in the three months to July. ""Industrials benefited disproportionately as markets priced in a significant economic recovery [after lockdowns around the world],"" UBS said. Chinaâs new richest person is a bottled water tycoon Inventor Sir James Dyson tops UK Rich List Tech billionaires have also had a good pandemic, seeing their wealth soar 41%. UBS said this was ""due to the corona-induced demand for their goods and services"" and social distancing accelerating ""digital businesses [and] compressing several years' evolution into a few months"". Healthcare billionaires also benefited as the crisis put drug makers and medical device companies in the spotlight. The rise in fortunes reflects the generally strong performance of global stock markets since late March, despite most countries continuing to suffer sharp recessions. Amazon boss Jeff Bezos and Tesla founder Elon Musk - both multi-billionaires - saw their wealth hit new highs this summer thanks to growth in the price of their companies' stock. In the last 11 years China's billionaires have increased their wealth by the biggest percentage, climbing 1,146% between 2009 and 2020, according to UBS. By comparison, over the same period the wealth of British billionaires has risen by just 168%. But the biggest accumulation of wealth remains in the US where American billionaires have $3.5trn, compared to China's $1.7trn. The UK's wealthy have just $205bn, compared to Germany's $595bn and France's $443bn. UBS said many billionaires had donated some of their wealth to help with the fight against Covid-19. ""Our research has identified 209 billionaires who have publicly committed a total equivalent to $7.2bn from March to June 2020,"" the report said. ""They have reacted quickly, in a way that's akin to disaster relief, providing unrestricted grants to allow grantees to decide how best to use funds."" But it revealed that UK billionaires donated less than those from other countries. In the US, 98 billionaires donated $4.5bn, in China 12 billionaires gave $679m, and in Australia just two billionaires donated $324m. But in the UK, nine billionaires donated just $298m.

"This video can not be played Nicola Sturgeon announces tougher restrictions for pubs and restaurants All pubs and restaurants across central Scotland are to be closed under new measures aimed at tackling a surge in coronavirus cases. The new rules will apply to licensed premises across the central belt, including Glasgow and Edinburgh. Pubs and restaurants will be able to open in other parts of Scotland - but can only serve alcohol outdoors. The new rules, which will be in force from 18:00 on Friday until 25 October, apply to about 3.4 million people. They cover people living in the Greater Glasgow and Clyde, Lanarkshire, Forth Valley, Lothian and Ayrshire and Arran health board areas. What are Scotland's new lockdown rules? Shutting the pubs - what's the evidence? Check the Covid rules where you live First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said the restrictions were ""intended to be short, sharp action to arrest a worrying increase in infection"". She warned that without taking action, the country risks ""returning to the peak level of infection by the end of the month"". But she admitted that the new rules would be disruptive to many businesses and would be unwelcome to many people. The Scottish Hospitality Group, which includes many of the the country's best known pubs and restaurants, accused the first minister of ""effectively signing a death sentence"" for many businesses. And the Federation of Small Businesses said the move would have a major knock on impact across other parts of the economy, including tourism. Opposition parties have called for more detail on a Â£40m support package for affected business that was announced by Ms Sturgeon, and have questioned the need for the blanket closure of pubs and restaurants. The new rules for the five central belt areas are: all licensed premises - with the exception of hotels for residents - will be required to close indoors and outdoors, although takeaways will be permitted cafes which do not have an alcohol licence will be able to stay open until 18:00 snooker and pool halls, indoor bowling alleys, casinos and bingo halls will also close in the five health board areas for two weeks from 10 October contact sports for people aged 18 and over will be suspended for the next two weeks - with an exception for professional sports indoor group exercise activities will not be allowed, although the current rules will remain in place for under 18s and gyms can remain open for individual exercise outdoor live events will not be permitted for the next fortnight. There will be no travel ban in any of the areas, but people in the central belt have been urged to avoid public transport unless it is ""absolutely necessary"". And they have also been advised not to travel outside of the health board area they live in if they do not need to. Throughout the pandemic Scotland has tended to adopt a slightly more cautious approach than England. It has imposed more restrictions and lifted them more slowly in general. The latest move is in line with that trend. There is little difference in overall infection rates. Scotland has seen 85 cases per 100,000 in the past week, compared to England's 109. The measures imposed by the Scottish government are focussed on areas with the highest infection rates. But those places are some way below the levels seen in England's hotspots. Cities such as Liverpool, Manchester and Newcastle have seen around 500 cases per 100,000 people over the past week - that is more than twice the level of infection in Glasgow for example. But the differences between the two nations should not mask the growing concern there is in England about the infection rates, particularly in the north of country. Senior ministers and their advisers are today discussing whether extra steps are needed south of the border. The problem is action to supress the virus has negative consequences too. This much can be seen in the growing number of scientists and health expertswho are signing the Great Barrington Declarationwarning about the impact of Covid lockdown policies. In other parts of the country, pubs, bars, restaurants and cafes will be able to open indoors until 18:00 - but only to serve food and non-alcoholic drinks. However, they will be able to serve alcohol in outdoor settings such as beer gardens until 22:00, with the current rules on no more than six people from two households remaining in place. And the existing rules will continue to apply to weddings that have already been booked, and funerals, in all parts of Scotland. Ms Sturgeon said regulations would be introduced to extend the mandatory use of face coverings in indoor communal settings such as staff canteens and workplace corridors. Shops across Scotland will be asked to return to 2m physical distancing from this weekend, and to reintroduce measures such as one-way systems. It comes as Scotland recorded more than 1,000 new confirmed cases of the virus in a single day for the first time - although the country is doing far more testing now than at the height of the pandemic earlier in the year. The R number is currently believed to be higher in Scotland than in other UK nations, and the number of people dying or in hospital with the virus has increased over the past week. The number of UK cases rose by 14,162 on Wednesday. This was a slight drop on Tuesday's figure, but the seven-day rolling average is still pointing upwards. Speaking in the Scottish Parliament, Ms Sturgeon said the ""vast majority"" of pubs and restaurants had worked hard to ensure the safety of their staff and customers. Beer gardens outside of the central belt will be able to serve alcohol until 22:00 But she added: ""Indoor environments, where different households from different age groups can mix, inevitably present a risk of transmission. ""That risk can be increased in some hospitality premises if good ventilation is difficult, and if it is hard to control the movement of people. ""And the presence of alcohol can of course affect people's willingness to physically distance."" Scottish Conservative group leader Ruth Davidson criticised a lack of detail over the Â£40m support package that was announced by the first minister. Ms Davidson said: ""These businesses deserve better. They need to know how much they can apply for, when they can apply for it and how long they will have to wait before support reaches them. ""Those answers could have been provided today, but Nicola Sturgeon failed to do that."" And Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard said the government should target premises which break the rules ""instead of shutting down every single business"". The temporary shutdown of pubs and restaurants across central Scotland with a new 6pm curfew elsewhere are significant new restrictions. Together with the existing Scotland-wide ban on visiting other households, these add up to the toughest combination of measures in place across any of the four UK nations. The Scottish government has decided to take further action because it fears case numbers are rising so fast that without further action, spread would be back to March/April levels by the end of this month. The hospitality industry is not convinced there is sufficient evidence to justify pubs and restaurants being so heavily targeted. The new measures are temporary, partly because the Scottish government has limited scope to compensate businesses. It hopes the UK government can be persuaded to offer additional support for hard hit sectors in the coming weeks and that all four nations can agree a new system for assessing and responding to the coronavirus threat on a more localised basis.

"This video can not be played Keir Starmer says it is getting âridiculousâ with the prime minster unable to explain coronavirus restrictions Boris Johnson has been challenged to publish the scientific evidence behind the 10pm closing time for English pubs ahead of a vote by MPs next week. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said the public ""deserved to know"" the basis for the restriction and if it could not be justified the rule must be reviewed. Tory MPs opposed to the move may rebel in the Commons vote. The PM said the rationale behind it had not changed and it was designed to reduce the spread of the virus. The two party leaders clashed over the effectiveness and fairness of national and local Covid restrictions at Prime Minister's Questions, with Sir Keir accusing the PM of incompetence and the PM saying Labour had supported the government's position, then changed its stance. All pubs, bars, restaurants and other hospitality venues in England have been required to close at 10pm since 24 September, as part of a package of measures to try and contain a surge of new cases in the North of England. Ministers argue it has had a ""beneficial effect"" on the spread of the virus in areas where the restriction had already been tried - but it has become a lighting rod for dissatisfaction on the Tory benches about Covid restrictions. Do local lockdowns stop the spread of covid? 14,542 new cases announced on Tuesday What's the evidence for 10pm pub closing time? And regional leaders, including the mayors of Greater Manchester and London, have called for it to be reviewed amid concerns it has led to large crowds gathering outside venues in some cities after closing time. In other developments: Allpubs and restaurants across the central belt of Scotland- including in Glasgow and Edinburgh - are to shut for two weeks from Friday amid a tightening of restrictions Pub operator Greene King has announced it will shut dozens of pubs with the loss of 800 jobs. New restrictions aimed at slowing a surge in coronavirus cases are to be announced by Scotland's first minister Transport Secretary Grant Shapps has said he will outline a taskforce to implement a testing system on people arriving in the country from abroad Commons Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle has urged MPs to wear face coverings while walking around Parliament However you look at the blizzard of statistics about the coronavirus, the disease is still spreading - despite town after town being placed under extra limits. Even before Nicola Sturgeon's moves on Wednesday to try to break the spread in Scotland, ministers in SW1 were looking at the next steps they would need to take to stop the acceleration of the virus. As we've reported, the government is likely to introduce a tiered approach to put different parts of the country with different spreads of the diseases into different categories. But the exact nature of the strictest form of restrictions are yet to be set in stone. Read Laura's full blog Labour has said a vote on whether to keep or scrap the 10pm closing time is expected on Monday, although the government has not confirmed the date. Sir Keir refused to say which way Labour would vote, telling the BBC the PM ""needs to make his case"" about how the 10pm cut-off reduces transmission and ""the ball very firmly is in his court"". Speaking earlier in Parliament, he said: ""Is there a scientific basis for the 10pm rule? ""The public and Parliament deserve to know. If there is, why does the government do itself a favour and publish it? ""If not, why does the government not review the rule?"" 'Rule of six' doesn't make sense, say Tory MPs 14,542 new cases announced on Tuesday Greene King to close dozens of pubs and cut 800 jobs In response, Mr Johnson said ""the basis on which we set out the curtailment of hospitality was the basis on which he accepted it two weeks ago. ""And that is the reduce the spread of the virus and that is our objective."" The prime minister accused Labour of withdrawing its support for other restrictions, after its MPs were told to abstain in a vote on Tuesday on maintaining the rule of six limit on social gatherings. ""What kind of signal does this send to the people of the country about the robustness of the Labour Party and their willingness to enforce the restrictions?"" he added. During heated exchanges, the Labour leader urged the PM to be straight with the public about whether local lockdowns were working and to explain why some areas of the country were not being subject to restrictions despite having a higher proportion of cases than those targeted. He said cases were continuing to rise in 19 of the 20 local council areas which had been to subject to restrictions between the end of July and start of August - including Bradford, Oldham, Rochdale, Stockport and Wigan. The Labour leader said that in Burnley, infection rates were 21 per 100,000 people when restrictions were introduced, while now it is 434. In Bolton, it was 18 per 100,000, while now it is 255.

At the same time, he said no extra restrictions were being applied in the London borough of Hillingdon - which is home to the PM's Uxbridge and Ruislip constituency - despite it having recorded weekly figures as high as 62 cases per 100,000 people. This, he said, was a far higher figure than the rate of infection in Kirklees in West Yorkshire - 29 cases per 100,000 people - when restrictions were imposed there on 30 July ""The prime minister really needs to understand that local communities are angry and frustrated,"" he said. ""So will he level with the people of Bury, Burnley and Bolton and tell them: what does he think the central problem is that's causing this? ""The prime minister can't explain why an area goes into restrictions. He can't explain what the different restrictions are, and he can't explain how restrictions end."" Mr Johnson said the combination of local and national measures in place were needed to deal with the continued sharp rise in cases in Manchester and Liverpool but also the uptick in infections in the Midlands and London. ""The local and regional approach, combined with national measures, remains correct because two thirds of those admitted into hospital on Sunday were in the North East, North West and Yorkshire,"" he said. Sir Keir grilled the prime minister on the effectiveness and fairness of local restrictions. ""Twenty local areas have been under restrictions for two months, in 19 of those 20 areas infections rates have gone up,"" he said, citing new Labour Party analysis. The trends highlighted in the report for those areas are correct. In fact, only in Leicester did we see sustained declines in case rates during a local lockdown, but those rates quickly increased when restrictions were loosened. The issue with the Labour analysis is that a handful of the places mentioned have not actually been in local lockdowns for two complete months. For example, Oadby and Wigston did face additional restrictions at the end of June, but these were lifted after a month. They were only placed under restrictions again on 22 September. On another point, Sir Keir said areas in parts of the north of England had been placed into local restrictions at rates lower than those experienced in parts of the south which are not under any kind of lockdown. This is true: Bury, Tameside, Stockport and Wigan (to name a few) had case rates of between 20 and 30 per 100,000 people when they first went into lockdown. The London borough of Hillingdon - the prime minister's constituency - had rates of 46 cases per 100,000, while Redbridge had 57 and Barking and Dagenham 53, in the week ending the 27 September, according to Public Health England. And analysis by the BBC data team suggests that these rates have increased in the past week. RULES:What are the restrictions in Scotland?

"People arriving in the UK from abroad may soon be able to end their 14-day self-isolation early, as part of plans to be considered by a new taskforce. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said the taskforce will look at introducing a Covid-19 testing system for travellers to the UK. People would have to pay for their own tests to avoid impacting NHS capacity. Airline and airport bosses reiterated calls to replace quarantine altogether, with a comprehensive testing system. The aviation industry has struggled with the drop in passenger numbers since the start of the UK's epidemic, with industry figures repeatedly lobbying for testing at ports and airports - something ministers have rejected. Anyone arriving to the UK from abroad must currently self-isolate for two weeks,unless they have come from an exempt destination. The plans to be considered by the Global Travel Taskforce include giving travellers the option of paying for a coronavirus test a few days after they arrive. A negative result would mean people could end their quarantine period early. The taskforce will also consider whether people could self-isolate before travelling abroad, instead of upon arrival. If you were running an airline or owned a travel agency I don't think you'd be jumping for joy. You would probably be relieved that the government has eventually done what you've been calling for for months and given a firmer commitment to testing, as a way to allow people to avoid quarantining for the full 14 days. But Heathrow had a facility for taking passengers' saliva swabs ready to go in mid-August. That facility now appears redundant because the government has rejected the scientific rationale behind testing passengers at airports on arrival - on the basis that asymptomatic people who recently caught the virus could still produce negative results. And even though ministers have made their firmest commitment yet to privately-funded testing, travel bosses will, to some extent, be pulling their hair out that key details still haven't been worked out. Namely, after how many days of quarantine would someone be able to pay for a test? Between five and eight days is what the government is considering. What airlines really want is the option of people having a test two or three days before they arrive. With a second test after you arrive in the UK that could reduce quarantine even further. The government has crucially indicated that it's willing to explore that idea. But aviation bosses just want ministers to get on with it - the creation of a taskforce wasn't the announcement they wanted on Wednesday. Announcing the plans, Mr Shapps said: ""The current measures at the border have saved lives. Our understanding of the science now means we can intensify efforts to develop options for a testing regime and help reinvigorate our world-leading travel sector. ""This new taskforce will not only help us move towards safer, smoother international travel as we continue to battle this virus but will also support global connectivity - helping facilitate more Covid-secure travel whilst protecting the population from imported cases."" Mr Shapps and Health Secretary Matt Hancock will lead the taskforce to consider: How a testing regime for international arrivals could be implemented, including exactly when passengers would be tested How to raise consumer confidence to support the recovery of international travel What ""innovate testing models and other non-testing means"" could boost travel The group is expected to report back to No 10 in November. Officials from Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland will all be involved in the taskforce's work. But as health matters are devolved, decision making and implementation may differ across the four nations. Why isn't the UK testing travellers on arrival? PM: Airport tests 'give false sense of security' British Airways: 'I felt forced into redundancy' While industry figures called the announcement a ""step in the right direction"", many also reiterated their belief that a testing programme should replace quarantine altogether. A spokeswoman for British Airways added: ""Although every step to improve the current situation is welcome, we do not believe quarantine is the solution. The best way to reassure people is to introduce a reliable and affordable test before flying."" Karen Dee, chief executive of the Airport Operators Association - a trade association for UK airports - said: ""We believe that from a health perspective a testing regime can be far preferable to just relying on quarantine."" And a Virgin Atlantic spokesperson said: ""Removing quarantine is the only way to truly open up the skies and enable the UK's economic recovery to take off."" This video can not be played Coronavirus: How to fly during a global pandemic (this video reflects the rules before the hotel quarantine was introduced in the UK) One airline trade body says testing people before they travel - an idea known as ""pre-departure testing"" - was becoming the ""international norm"" and should be adopted in the UK too ""as soon as practically possible"". ""Aviation is at a critical juncture and we have no time to lose,"" added Airlines UK's chief executive, Tim Alderslade. Many industry figures also called for the taskforce to bring in changes - rather than just recommendations - within weeks. A joint statement from the CEOs of Easyjet, Heathrow, Manchester Airports Group (MAG) and Virgin Atlantic said a testing regime must be in place by early November because without ""rapid"" action, ""the UK will fall even further behind our competitors and the economic recovery will fail to get off the ground"".

"Jeff Bezos's fortune hit a record high this summer Billionaires have seen their fortunes hit record highs during the pandemic, with top executives from technology and industry earning the most. The world's richest saw their wealth climb 27.5% to $10.2trn (Â£7.9trn) from April to July this year, according to a report from Swiss bank UBS. That was up from the previous peak of $8.9trn at the end of 2017 and largely due to rising global share prices. UBS said billionaires had done ""extremely well"" in the Covid crisis. It also said the number of billionaires had hit a new high of 2,189, up from 2,158 in 2017. It comes as a World Bank report on Wednesday showedextreme poverty is set to rise this year for the first time in more than two decadesdue to the pandemic. Among the billionaires, the biggest winners this year have been industrialists, whose wealth rose a staggering 44% in the three months to July. ""Industrials benefited disproportionately as markets priced in a significant economic recovery [after lockdowns around the world],"" UBS said. Chinaâs new richest person is a bottled water tycoon Inventor Sir James Dyson tops UK Rich List Tech billionaires have also had a good pandemic, seeing their wealth soar 41%. UBS said this was ""due to the corona-induced demand for their goods and services"" and social distancing accelerating ""digital businesses [and] compressing several years' evolution into a few months"". Healthcare billionaires also benefited as the crisis put drug makers and medical device companies in the spotlight. The rise in fortunes reflects the generally strong performance of global stock markets since late March, despite most countries continuing to suffer sharp recessions. Amazon boss Jeff Bezos and Tesla founder Elon Musk - both multi-billionaires - saw their wealth hit new highs this summer thanks to growth in the price of their companies' stock. In the last 11 years China's billionaires have increased their wealth by the biggest percentage, climbing 1,146% between 2009 and 2020, according to UBS. By comparison, over the same period the wealth of British billionaires has risen by just 168%. But the biggest accumulation of wealth remains in the US where American billionaires have $3.5trn, compared to China's $1.7trn. The UK's wealthy have just $205bn, compared to Germany's $595bn and France's $443bn. UBS said many billionaires had donated some of their wealth to help with the fight against Covid-19. ""Our research has identified 209 billionaires who have publicly committed a total equivalent to $7.2bn from March to June 2020,"" the report said. ""They have reacted quickly, in a way that's akin to disaster relief, providing unrestricted grants to allow grantees to decide how best to use funds."" But it revealed that UK billionaires donated less than those from other countries. In the US, 98 billionaires donated $4.5bn, in China 12 billionaires gave $679m, and in Australia just two billionaires donated $324m. But in the UK, nine billionaires donated just $298m.

"This video can not be played Nicola Sturgeon announces tougher restrictions for pubs and restaurants All pubs and restaurants across central Scotland are to be closed under new measures aimed at tackling a surge in coronavirus cases. The new rules will apply to licensed premises across the central belt, including Glasgow and Edinburgh. Pubs and restaurants will be able to open in other parts of Scotland - but can only serve alcohol outdoors. The new rules, which will be in force from 18:00 on Friday until 25 October, apply to about 3.4 million people. They cover people living in the Greater Glasgow and Clyde, Lanarkshire, Forth Valley, Lothian and Ayrshire and Arran health board areas. What are Scotland's new lockdown rules? Shutting the pubs - what's the evidence? Check the Covid rules where you live First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said the restrictions were ""intended to be short, sharp action to arrest a worrying increase in infection"". She warned that without taking action, the country risks ""returning to the peak level of infection by the end of the month"". But she admitted that the new rules would be disruptive to many businesses and would be unwelcome to many people. The Scottish Hospitality Group, which includes many of the the country's best known pubs and restaurants, accused the first minister of ""effectively signing a death sentence"" for many businesses. And the Federation of Small Businesses said the move would have a major knock on impact across other parts of the economy, including tourism. Opposition parties have called for more detail on a Â£40m support package for affected business that was announced by Ms Sturgeon, and have questioned the need for the blanket closure of pubs and restaurants. The new rules for the five central belt areas are: all licensed premises - with the exception of hotels for residents - will be required to close indoors and outdoors, although takeaways will be permitted cafes which do not have an alcohol licence will be able to stay open until 18:00 snooker and pool halls, indoor bowling alleys, casinos and bingo halls will also close in the five health board areas for two weeks from 10 October contact sports for people aged 18 and over will be suspended for the next two weeks - with an exception for professional sports indoor group exercise activities will not be allowed, although the current rules will remain in place for under 18s and gyms can remain open for individual exercise outdoor live events will not be permitted for the next fortnight. There will be no travel ban in any of the areas, but people in the central belt have been urged to avoid public transport unless it is ""absolutely necessary"". And they have also been advised not to travel outside of the health board area they live in if they do not need to. Throughout the pandemic Scotland has tended to adopt a slightly more cautious approach than England. It has imposed more restrictions and lifted them more slowly in general. The latest move is in line with that trend. There is little difference in overall infection rates. Scotland has seen 85 cases per 100,000 in the past week, compared to England's 109. The measures imposed by the Scottish government are focussed on areas with the highest infection rates. But those places are some way below the levels seen in England's hotspots. Cities such as Liverpool, Manchester and Newcastle have seen around 500 cases per 100,000 people over the past week - that is more than twice the level of infection in Glasgow for example. But the differences between the two nations should not mask the growing concern there is in England about the infection rates, particularly in the north of country. Senior ministers and their advisers are today discussing whether extra steps are needed south of the border. The problem is action to supress the virus has negative consequences too. This much can be seen in the growing number of scientists and health expertswho are signing the Great Barrington Declarationwarning about the impact of Covid lockdown policies. In other parts of the country, pubs, bars, restaurants and cafes will be able to open indoors until 18:00 - but only to serve food and non-alcoholic drinks. However, they will be able to serve alcohol in outdoor settings such as beer gardens until 22:00, with the current rules on no more than six people from two households remaining in place. And the existing rules will continue to apply to weddings that have already been booked, and funerals, in all parts of Scotland. Ms Sturgeon said regulations would be introduced to extend the mandatory use of face coverings in indoor communal settings such as staff canteens and workplace corridors. Shops across Scotland will be asked to return to 2m physical distancing from this weekend, and to reintroduce measures such as one-way systems. It comes as Scotland recorded more than 1,000 new confirmed cases of the virus in a single day for the first time - although the country is doing far more testing now than at the height of the pandemic earlier in the year. The R number is currently believed to be higher in Scotland than in other UK nations, and the number of people dying or in hospital with the virus has increased over the past week. The number of UK cases rose by 14,162 on Wednesday. This was a slight drop on Tuesday's figure, but the seven-day rolling average is still pointing upwards. Speaking in the Scottish Parliament, Ms Sturgeon said the ""vast majority"" of pubs and restaurants had worked hard to ensure the safety of their staff and customers. Beer gardens outside of the central belt will be able to serve alcohol until 22:00 But she added: ""Indoor environments, where different households from different age groups can mix, inevitably present a risk of transmission. ""That risk can be increased in some hospitality premises if good ventilation is difficult, and if it is hard to control the movement of people. ""And the presence of alcohol can of course affect people's willingness to physically distance."" Scottish Conservative group leader Ruth Davidson criticised a lack of detail over the Â£40m support package that was announced by the first minister. Ms Davidson said: ""These businesses deserve better. They need to know how much they can apply for, when they can apply for it and how long they will have to wait before support reaches them. ""Those answers could have been provided today, but Nicola Sturgeon failed to do that."" And Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard said the government should target premises which break the rules ""instead of shutting down every single business"". The temporary shutdown of pubs and restaurants across central Scotland with a new 6pm curfew elsewhere are significant new restrictions. Together with the existing Scotland-wide ban on visiting other households, these add up to the toughest combination of measures in place across any of the four UK nations. The Scottish government has decided to take further action because it fears case numbers are rising so fast that without further action, spread would be back to March/April levels by the end of this month. The hospitality industry is not convinced there is sufficient evidence to justify pubs and restaurants being so heavily targeted. The new measures are temporary, partly because the Scottish government has limited scope to compensate businesses. It hopes the UK government can be persuaded to offer additional support for hard hit sectors in the coming weeks and that all four nations can agree a new system for assessing and responding to the coronavirus threat on a more localised basis.

"Covid restrictions are to be further tightened in parts of England early next week, with the closure of pubs and restaurants a possibility in the worst-affected areas, the BBC has been told. There could also be a ban on overnight stays away from home in these areas. A final decision on the time period or extent of potential closures has not yet been made. The government is also likely to introducea three-tier system for local lockdowns. Under the system, different parts of the country would be placed in different categories - although ministers are still discussing the precise details of the toughest level of restrictions over the next couple of days. A formal announcement is not likely to come until Monday, according to BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg. Check the Covid rules where you live What is the risk of Covid overwhelming the NHS? Do local lockdowns stop the spread of Covid? Meanwhile, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmerhas challenged the government to publish the scientific evidence behind the 22:00 closing time for pubs and restaurants- and refused to say whether his party would vote in support of the measure in Parliament next week. Communities Secretary Robert Jenrick said there was ""evidence hospitality plays a role"" in spreading the virus. But pressed on whether the government would publish this evidence, he told the BBC: ""It is commonsensical that the longer you stay in pubs and restaurants, the more likely you are to come into contact with other individuals. ""The more drinks that people have, the more likely that some people are to break the rules."" He added that it was right to ""take action decisively, rather than waiting for the most detailed epidemiological evidence to emerge"". On the possibility of additional restrictions for some parts of England, Mr Jenrick said the government was ""currently considering what steps to take"" and the precise measures for different areas would be announced ""in the coming days"". He did not rule out pubs being closed but said measures would be ""proportionate and localised"". He added that the government was trying to give ""greater consistency on rules so they're easier to understand"" and was working on ""slightly broader canvases of regions or cities and counties to avoid differences in people's daily lives if they drive over the border"". Pubs and restaurants across Central Scotland have already been told they will have to close It comes assignificant new measures are introduced in Scotland. From Friday, all pubs and restaurants across central Scotland, including Glasgow and Edinburgh, are to close, while in the rest of Scotland hospitality venues must shut at 18:00 BST and alcohol can only be served outdoors. Industry leaders are warningthe measures could be the final straw for many businesses. On Wednesday the number of UK cases rose by 14,162, with a further 70 deaths reported. The planned tightening of restrictions in parts of England follows rising infection rates across much of the country, with medical leaders warning the NHS is at risk of becoming overwhelmed. Liverpool, Manchester and Newcastle upon Tyne have the highest infection rates in the country. A government source told the BBC the situation in the north-west and north-east of England was ""very troubling"", with growing numbers of hospital admissions and more elderly people in intensive care. These areas will be placed into the top tier of restrictions, with an announcement possibly as early as Monday, in a new system called the Local Covid Alert Level. But there remains a debate within cabinet over how far the restrictions in the top tier should go, with some in No 10 arguing for measures like those in Scotland. The plan is for schools to remain open in all circumstances. The Labour mayor of Greater Manchester, Andy Burnham, reacted angrily to the reports, tweeting: ""No discussion. No consultation. Millions of lives affected by Whitehall diktat. It is proving impossible to deal with this government."" It's a complicated equation. The Department of Health is worried about the spread of the disease, as well as other patients losing out on other treatments because of the focus on Covid. No 11 is fearful about the impact on the economy, which has already had a profound shock. And it's No 10's job to worry about all of it, then reach a conclusion. But Boris Johnson also knows that his own MPs and the opposition parties are more and more sceptical as each day passes about what the government proposes. It's clear that shutting pubs and restaurants is a possibility - the ""circuit breaker"" that we have talked about on here lots of times. But there are many questions still to be settled. Read more from Laura here. Under the new system, all areas would be subject to the current England-wide restrictions, but there would be much more robust measures for the top tier - the one with the highest infection rates. There are already tighter restrictions in parts of the north-east and north-west of England, Birmingham and Leicester, where the rate of infection has been rising. But there are currently no extra restrictions for hospitality venues in these areas beyond those in force nationally, such as the 22:00 closing time for pubs and restaurants. The Treasury is looking at providing financial support to the industry in the worst-hit areas, and a memo seen by the BBC shows plans for additional money for local authorities. They would get Â£1 per head of population if placed into tier two, and Â£2 per head for tier three. Kate Nicholls, chief executive of UK Hospitality, said if venues were forced to close the industry would need a return to a full furlough scheme and additional financial support. She said the Â£40m of support announced for hospitality venues by the Scottish government, when shared between 16,000 premises, equated to just over Â£2,000 each, which ""barely keeps the lights on, let alone saving jobs"". The planned changes come as medical leaders warn that rising infection levels across the country could leave the NHS ""unable to cope"". The Academy of Medical Colleges, which represents the UK and Ireland's 24 medical royal colleges, called on people to abide ""strictly"" to coronavirus measures to prevent NHS services from becoming overwhelmed. Helen Stokes-Lampard, chair of the academy, said: ""Given the recent dramatic spike in both the number of cases and hospital admissions it is clear that we could soon be back to where we were in April if we are not all extremely careful."" She told BBC Breakfast that while there were hotspots in the north-east and north-west of England, a lot of cities were now seeing ""serious problems"" and the virus was ""working further south"". In other developments: Police in England and Wales are being given an extra Â£30m by the government to enforce coronavirus restrictions, while another Â£30m will be provided for Covid marshals to help ensure rules are followed in English council areas The UK government has agreed to pay up to Â£2mto settle a lawsuit over how it selected an IT contractfor coronavirus testing at its Lighthouse labs People arriving in the UK from abroad may soon be able to end their 14-day self-isolation early, withplans for a testing system being considered by a new taskforce National 5 examsare to be cancelled in Scotland in 2021and replaced with teacher assessments and coursework SOCIAL DISTANCING:How have rules on meeting friends changed?

"However you look at the blizzard of statistics about the Coronavirus, the disease is still spreading - despite town after town being placed under extra limits. Even beforeNicola Sturgeon's moves on Wednesdayto try to break the spread in Scotland, ministers in SW1 were looking at the next steps they would need to take to stop the acceleration of the virus. As we've reported, the government is likely to introduce a tiered approach to put different parts of the country with different spreads of the diseases into different categories. But the exact nature of the strictest form of restrictions are yet to be set in stone. Pubs and restaurants in central Scotland to close Shutting the pubs - what's the evidence?

Would that happen everywhere? Or just in the most affected parts of the country? Would closures be total or for a certain period of time only? Would they be temporary? Or put in place until an indeterminate time? A lot is unknown, but the discussions are serious. The Treasury is already looking at financial support for the different options, including not just closing pubs in the most affected areas, but potentially well beyond.

"Democrat Kamala Harris and Republican Vice-President Mike Pence debated in Salt Lake City, Utah It was more civil than last week's chaotic event at the top of the ticket and had more policy discussions Pence defended the US response to Covid-19, which has killed 200,000 Americans Harris called it ""the greatest failure of any presidential administration in the history of our country"" They also tangled over taxes, with Pence accusing Harris of a tax hike on working people, which she denies The duo on stage were separated by glass barriers as a precaution for the pandemic A fly landing on Pence's head during the debate provided a little light relief for thousands on social media Edited by Helier Cheung Thanks for following our live reporting on the US election vice-presidential debate - we're bringing it to a close now. Here's a recap of what we saw and heard on Wednesday in Salt Lake City, Utah:  For more, you canread our reporter Anthony Zurcher's five takeaways from the debate. We'll be back next week with live coverage of the second presidential debate, and in the meantime you can also follow ourlive coronavirus coverage here. The VP debate coverage was brought to you by our teams in the US and UK. The writers were Boer Deng, Rebecca Seales, Ritu Prasad, Max Matza, Tara McKelvey, Tom Gerken, Marianna Brady, Jessica Lussenhop, David Walker and Georgina Rannard. The editors were Vicky Baker, Matthew Davis and Helier Cheung.   Anthony ZurcherBBC North America reporter This video can not be played 'Mr Vice-President, I am speaking' - Harris and Pence clash at VP debate This vice-presidential debate gave the Americans who chose to watch a look at US politics present and future. For the current election, both candidates did their best to defend their running mate and land shots on the top of the opposing ticket. The participants in this debate were also looking beyond November, however. Pence - like most vice-presidents - has his eyes on a presidential bid of his own. To do that, he'll have to win over Trump's base while also casting a wider net to Republicans and right-leaning independents who may have become disaffected with Trumpian politics. Harris, who at this point last year was running for president herself, tried to prove that she can be a capable standard-bearer for the Democrats once Joe Biden exits the political stage. When given the chance, she spoke about her upbringing and background, taking the opportunity to introduce herself to a larger US audience. Both Pence and Harris live to fight another day - and that day could come in just four years. Read more:Five takeaways from the VP debate Amid all the coverage of the debate, you might have missed this news from Facebook. The social media platform has announced a new series of measures regarding the US election. Noting that final election results may take longer to come in than usual due to the pandemic and postal voting, the social media giant said on Wednesday it was trying to ""prevent the spread of misinformation"".

Donald Trump and Joe Biden will face each other again on 15 October The next big event in the election calendar is the second debate between President Donald Trump and Democrat candidate Joe Biden in one week in Florida. Scheduled for 15 October at the Adrienne Arsht Center for the Performing Arts in Miami, the 90-minute debate will have local residents in the audience who can pose questions to the candidates. But Trump's recent coronavirus diagnosis raised questions about whether the event will go ahead. The president has insisted he will be well enough to attend, and Joe Biden said on Monday he would share a stage with Trump as long as medical experts gave the go-ahead. The debate on Wednesday was more substantive than when President Donald Trump and Joe Biden debated last week.

The VP debate is receiving prominent coverage in Indian media today, and ""Kamala"" is one of the top trending topics on Twitter in India along with #VicePresidentialDebate2020, and #VPDebate, BBC Monitoring reports. The US and India are allies, but there is also a high level of interest in the debate because Kamala Harris' mother was born in India. So what was Indian media's verdict on the debate? The consensus seems to be - nothing spectacular, but at least it was more substantial than the presidential debate. News channel NDTV said the VP debate was ""unlikely to alter the trajectory of the race"" while News18 concluded that, despite ""important issues"" being discussed, ""a fly still became the most interesting thing"". Meanwhile, newspaper Hindustan TImes wrote: ""Despite tensions between the two camps, both Harris and Pence debated relatively more calmly compared to last monthâs acrimonious opening debate between Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden and President Donald Trump."" Either way, the reviews are more favourable than those of the presidential debate last week - where news channel AajTak accused both Trump and Biden of ""mud-slinging"", while the Times of India wrote: ""The US embarrassed itself before the world for 100 minutes.""  USA Today's Susan Page moderated Tuesday's vice-presidential debate After last week's chaotic presidential debate, a lot of attention on Tuesday was on moderator Susan Page - could she bring some discipline to the show? The verdict online is that while this debate was undoubtedly better at airing important issues, the USA Today journalist did not do enough to stop the candidates interrupting each other or dodging questions. Democrat Kamala Harris had to remind her opponent ""Mr Vice-President, I'm speaking"" when Mike Pence interrupted her numerous times. ""Susan Pageâs ultimate failure is that she made the first black woman ever to participate in a#VPdebate,externalfight for equal treatment and equal time,""tweeted one Democrat activist.,external According to a tally by CBS, Pence interrupted Harris twice as many times as she did him over the course of their 90-minute debate. Page's polite approach to encouraging candidates to finish speaking has also been criticised.Politico,externalnotes that Page said versions of ""thank you"" or âthank you, Mr Vice President"" 22 times to Pence, but with little effect. Some also criticised Page for calling Kamala Harris by her first name at one point (instead of Senator Harris) but addressing Mike Pence by his title vice-president. On matters of substance, critics said Page allowed the candidates to dodge answering difficult questions - including Harris on the Supreme Court, and Pence on whether he wanted to ban abortion in his home state.   Pence's left eye sparked speculation and Google searches Google says that âpink eye Covidâ was one of the top search trends within the first half-hour of the debate. Why? Well, a lot of viewers noticed that Pence's left eye looked a bit red at the start of the debate - and started speculating over whether it was a symptom of Covid-19, particularly given the recent outbreak at the White House. It's worth bearing in mind that eye problems are not among the main symptoms of Covid-19 -the World Health Organization says the most common symptoms are,externala fever, dry cough and tiredness. It does describe conjunctivitis, which can lead to red or pink eyes, as one of the less common symptoms. But the White House says Pence has been tested daily, and consistently tested negative - including on Wednesday, before the debate was held. There's been a lot of coverage of Ms Harris's black and Indian roots. But she also lived in Canada as a teenager, when her mother took a job teaching at McGill University. And a new book about her early years in Canada claims she had a strong campaigning streak even when she
was a high school student. The 12-page bilingual comic bookKamala in Canada,external, by author
and illustrator Kaj Hasselriis, tells how Ms Harris took on the landlord of her
family's apartment in Montreal, Quebec, who had stopped children playing football
in the courtyard. Back in August, when Harris was confirmed as Joe Biden's running mate, we noted that the choice inspired people from a lot of different countries - including India, Jamaica and Canada. If you're joining us now from Europe - or if you're just catching up on the VP debate now, here's a handy video of some of the key exchanges. The vice-presidential candidates debated the administration's response to the coronavirus pandemic - but also tackled subjects like foreign policy, racial justice and the environment. This video can not be played Pence and Harris clash on President Trump's record President Trump had a busy evening on Twitter, which included releasing a new video where he called his coronavirus infection ""a blessing from
God"" in disguise. In the five-minute footage filmed outside the Oval Office, Mr Trump said he wanted all Americans to have access to the treatments
he was given - and promised to provide the drugs free of charge. He wrongly claimed the
experimental antibody cocktail he received last week was a cure rather than a
therapeutic - and said hundreds of thousands of doses were nearly ready. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

have been mixed in their response to Ms Harrisâs ticket. Prime Minister
Narendra Modiâs supporters are ambivalent, partly because of Ms Harrisâ criticism of his move to revoke Kashmirâs autonomy, and the refusal of his
foreign minister to meet a congressman who has been critical of the same
move. And although
Indian-Americans have historically voted for Democrats for being immigration
friendly, President Trump is considered a friend of India and Mr Modi. It will
be interesting to see how much support Ms Harris can garner from Indian-American voters in these polarised times.

Sanders accused Pence âmansplaining,â and âman-dodgingâ as he interrupted Harris and the debate moderator.

Here's a quick summary of the VP debate between Mike Pence and Kamala Harris:  During the debate, Harris voiced concerns about the Trump administration's attempt to change regulations to get a Covid-19 vaccination approved urgently. Democrats say Trump may try to push out dangerously untested therapies ahead of election day. ""If the doctors tell us we should take it I'll be the first in line to take it, absolutely,"" Harris said. ""But if Donald Trump tells us we should take it, I'm not gonna take it."" Pence fires back that vaccine trials are moving at record speed, telling her to ""stop playing politics with people's lives"". This video can not be played Mike Pence: 'Stop playing politics with people's lives' Peter BowesNorth America correspondent For the most part this was a more orderly and respectful encounter than last weekâs debate between Donald Trump and Joe Biden.  But there were heated clashes between the two candidates, who were separated by two plexiglass dividers and seated almost four metres apart. Coronavirus dominated the first section, with Mike Pence accusing Kamala Harris of undermining public confidence when she said she would not take a vaccine if told to do so by President Trump. Pence avoided answering a question about whether heâd talked to the president about succeeding him, if he were to become too ill, or disabled, and unable to carry out his duties. Reality Check Defending the Trump administration's handling of the US economy, Vice-President Pence said: ""Right after a time where we're going through a pandemic that lost 22 million jobs at the height, we've already added back 11.6 million jobs"". Thatâs roughly correct, although the unemployment rate is still significantly higher than it was prior to the pandemic. From March to April this year, more than 22.7 million Americans lost their jobs. Since then, around 11.4 million jobs have been added. The unemployment rate is currently 7.9%. It was 3.5% in February this year, before the coronavirus outbreak hit in the US. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Democrat Kamala Harris and Republican Vice-President Mike Pence debated in Salt Lake City, Utah It was more civil than last week's chaotic event at the top of the ticket and had more policy discussions Pence defended the US response to Covid-19, which has killed 200,000 Americans Harris called it ""the greatest failure of any presidential administration in the history of our country"" They also tangled over taxes, with Pence accusing Harris of a tax hike on working people, which she denies The duo on stage were separated by glass barriers as a precaution for the pandemic A fly landing on Pence's head during the debate provided a little light relief for thousands on social media Edited by Helier Cheung Thanks for following our live reporting on the US election vice-presidential debate - we're bringing it to a close now. Here's a recap of what we saw and heard on Wednesday in Salt Lake City, Utah:  For more, you canread our reporter Anthony Zurcher's five takeaways from the debate. We'll be back next week with live coverage of the second presidential debate, and in the meantime you can also follow ourlive coronavirus coverage here. The VP debate coverage was brought to you by our teams in the US and UK. The writers were Boer Deng, Rebecca Seales, Ritu Prasad, Max Matza, Tara McKelvey, Tom Gerken, Marianna Brady, Jessica Lussenhop, David Walker and Georgina Rannard. The editors were Vicky Baker, Matthew Davis and Helier Cheung.   Anthony ZurcherBBC North America reporter This video can not be played 'Mr Vice-President, I am speaking' - Harris and Pence clash at VP debate This vice-presidential debate gave the Americans who chose to watch a look at US politics present and future. For the current election, both candidates did their best to defend their running mate and land shots on the top of the opposing ticket. The participants in this debate were also looking beyond November, however. Pence - like most vice-presidents - has his eyes on a presidential bid of his own. To do that, he'll have to win over Trump's base while also casting a wider net to Republicans and right-leaning independents who may have become disaffected with Trumpian politics. Harris, who at this point last year was running for president herself, tried to prove that she can be a capable standard-bearer for the Democrats once Joe Biden exits the political stage. When given the chance, she spoke about her upbringing and background, taking the opportunity to introduce herself to a larger US audience. Both Pence and Harris live to fight another day - and that day could come in just four years.

"The Royal Glamorgan Hospital is based in Rhondda Cynon Taf, where a local lockdown is in place Twenty-one patients have now died with coronavirus following an outbreak at a hospital. To date 127 cases have been linked to an outbreak at theRoyal Glamorgan Hospital in Llantrisant, Rhondda Cynon Taf. Two people have also died amid outbreaks at Prince Charles Hospital, and the Princess of Wales Hospital. Cwm Taf Morgannwg Health Board said ""immediate measures"" had been taken to stop the virus spreading. Medical Director Dr Nick Lyons said there was no evidence of Covid transmission between the three hospitals, and the rise in cases was ""inevitable"". As of Tuesday, 17 cases had been linked to an outbreak at Prince Charles Hospital, in Merthyr Tydfil, and one person had died. Figures also show 15 cases have been linked to Princess of Wales Hospital, Bridgend, and one person has died. Visiting has been suspended at Prince Charles Hospital in Merthyr Tydfil, among others Visits to the hospitals were suspended in September,following concerns in a rise in coronavirus cases in communities. Rhondda Cynon Taf, Bridgend and Merthyr Tydfil, are all currently subject to local lockdown restrictions, with people banned from socialising indoors and from entering or leaving the areas without a ""reasonable excuse"". Wales' top doctor warns of difficult winter How many cases and deaths have there been?

In addition, 194 new cases were confirmed in the area, with 93 in RCT, 33 in Bridgend and 23 in Merthyr Tydfil. Merthyr Tydfil now has the highest case rate of coronavirus in Wales, with 200.6 cases per 100,000 of the population over the last seven days. Dr Lyons said all of the confirmed cases linked to the outbreak had tested positive for Covid-19 within 14 days of attending one of the hospitals, but some patients may have caught it elsewhere.""If we look at other outbreaks in other parts of the country, it was inevitable,"" he said. ""It's too early to say we've reached the top of the curve. It's too early to draw conclusions, and the focus needs to be on making the hospital safe."" He added: ""The safety of our patients and staff remains our first priority and immediate measures to contain the spread of the virus have been put in place. ""We are taking the outbreaks extremely seriously and the stringent and robust mitigating actions which have been taken across our sites are being closely observed. ""However given the nature of Coronavirus, there is an inevitable time delay when we will see the positive impact of these measures.Â "" The Princess of Wales Hospital in Bridgend has also seen an outbreak of Covid All routine surgery had already been cancelled at Royal Glamorgan, with patients attending the A&E sent elsewhere, while a field hospital is being used for patients to rehabilitate before being sent home. A helpline has been set up for any relatives or people living in the communities who have concerns, which can be reached on 01685 726464. Dr Lyons said infection rates in communities were ""continuing to rise"" and appealed to people to not break social distancing and lockdown rules. ""We remain grateful to all members of our community who are continuing to adhere to the guidance in order to help control this virus,"" he said. Local MP Alex Davies-Jones and Member of the Senedd (MS) Mick Antoniw said the rise in the number of deaths at the Royal Glamorgan was deeply troubling.""It is an incredibly worrying deterioration in what was already a major incident and we know that local people will share our concern,"" they said.Â ""We are seeking urgent clarification from the health board on why this has happened and more importantly, what measures are being implemented to ensure that the outbreak is fully contained.""

"Mr Trump takes off his mask on his arrival back at the White House from hospital US President Donald Trump says he feels great after his Covid-19 illness, describing it as ""a blessing from God"". Mr Trump returned to the Oval Office on Wednesday, officials said, less than a week after testing positive. The president has had no Covid-19 symptoms for more than 24 hours and has been fever-free for more than four days, his doctor, Sean Conley, said. In a video message on Wednesday, Mr Trump said all Americans should have access to the treatments he was given. Mr Trump also promised to provide the drugs produced by Regeneron Pharmaceuticals free of charge.

Reports said there did appear to be much more mask-wearing at the White House, which had been criticised by many opponents for its lax attitude before Mr Trump's infection. Although the names of many people who have interacted with the president and tested positive are now known, it remains unclear just how many were exposed at the White House.

"Covid restrictions are to be further tightened in parts of England early next week, with the closure of pubs and restaurants a possibility in the worst-affected areas, the BBC has been told. There could also be a ban on overnight stays away from home in these areas. A final decision on the time period or extent of potential closures has not yet been made. The government is also likely to introducea three-tier system for local lockdowns. Under the system, different parts of the country would be placed in different categories - although ministers are still discussing the precise details of the toughest level of restrictions over the next couple of days. A formal announcement is not likely to come until Monday, according to BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg. Check the Covid rules where you live What is the risk of Covid overwhelming the NHS? Do local lockdowns stop the spread of Covid? Meanwhile, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmerhas challenged the government to publish the scientific evidence behind the 22:00 closing time for pubs and restaurants- and refused to say whether his party would vote in support of the measure in Parliament next week. Communities Secretary Robert Jenrick said there was ""evidence hospitality plays a role"" in spreading the virus. But pressed on whether the government would publish this evidence, he told the BBC: ""It is commonsensical that the longer you stay in pubs and restaurants, the more likely you are to come into contact with other individuals. ""The more drinks that people have, the more likely that some people are to break the rules."" He added that it was right to ""take action decisively, rather than waiting for the most detailed epidemiological evidence to emerge"". On the possibility of additional restrictions for some parts of England, Mr Jenrick said the government was ""currently considering what steps to take"" and the precise measures for different areas would be announced ""in the coming days"". He did not rule out pubs being closed but said measures would be ""proportionate and localised"". He added that the government was trying to give ""greater consistency on rules so they're easier to understand"" and was working on ""slightly broader canvases of regions or cities and counties to avoid differences in people's daily lives if they drive over the border"". Pubs and restaurants across Central Scotland have already been told they will have to close It comes assignificant new measures are introduced in Scotland. From Friday, all pubs and restaurants across central Scotland, including Glasgow and Edinburgh, are to close, while in the rest of Scotland hospitality venues must shut at 18:00 BST and alcohol can only be served outdoors. Industry leaders are warningthe measures could be the final straw for many businesses. On Wednesday the number of UK cases rose by 14,162, with a further 70 deaths reported. The planned tightening of restrictions in parts of England follows rising infection rates across much of the country, with medical leaders warning the NHS is at risk of becoming overwhelmed. Liverpool, Manchester and Newcastle upon Tyne have the highest infection rates in the country. A government source told the BBC the situation in the north-west and north-east of England was ""very troubling"", with growing numbers of hospital admissions and more elderly people in intensive care. These areas will be placed into the top tier of restrictions, with an announcement possibly as early as Monday, in a new system called the Local Covid Alert Level. But there remains a debate within cabinet over how far the restrictions in the top tier should go, with some in No 10 arguing for measures like those in Scotland. The plan is for schools to remain open in all circumstances. The Labour mayor of Greater Manchester, Andy Burnham, reacted angrily to the reports, tweeting: ""No discussion. No consultation. Millions of lives affected by Whitehall diktat. It is proving impossible to deal with this government."" It's a complicated equation. The Department of Health is worried about the spread of the disease, as well as other patients losing out on other treatments because of the focus on Covid. No 11 is fearful about the impact on the economy, which has already had a profound shock. And it's No 10's job to worry about all of it, then reach a conclusion. But Boris Johnson also knows that his own MPs and the opposition parties are more and more sceptical as each day passes about what the government proposes. It's clear that shutting pubs and restaurants is a possibility - the ""circuit breaker"" that we have talked about on here lots of times. But there are many questions still to be settled. Read more from Laura here. Under the new system, all areas would be subject to the current England-wide restrictions, but there would be much more robust measures for the top tier - the one with the highest infection rates. There are already tighter restrictions in parts of the north-east and north-west of England, Birmingham and Leicester, where the rate of infection has been rising. But there are currently no extra restrictions for hospitality venues in these areas beyond those in force nationally, such as the 22:00 closing time for pubs and restaurants. The Treasury is looking at providing financial support to the industry in the worst-hit areas, and a memo seen by the BBC shows plans for additional money for local authorities. They would get Â£1 per head of population if placed into tier two, and Â£2 per head for tier three. Kate Nicholls, chief executive of UK Hospitality, said if venues were forced to close the industry would need a return to a full furlough scheme and additional financial support. She said the Â£40m of support announced for hospitality venues by the Scottish government, when shared between 16,000 premises, equated to just over Â£2,000 each, which ""barely keeps the lights on, let alone saving jobs"". The planned changes come as medical leaders warn that rising infection levels across the country could leave the NHS ""unable to cope"". The Academy of Medical Colleges, which represents the UK and Ireland's 24 medical royal colleges, called on people to abide ""strictly"" to coronavirus measures to prevent NHS services from becoming overwhelmed. Helen Stokes-Lampard, chair of the academy, said: ""Given the recent dramatic spike in both the number of cases and hospital admissions it is clear that we could soon be back to where we were in April if we are not all extremely careful."" She told BBC Breakfast that while there were hotspots in the north-east and north-west of England, a lot of cities were now seeing ""serious problems"" and the virus was ""working further south"". In other developments: Police in England and Wales are being given an extra Â£30m by the government to enforce coronavirus restrictions, while another Â£30m will be provided for Covid marshals to help ensure rules are followed in English council areas The UK government has agreed to pay up to Â£2mto settle a lawsuit over how it selected an IT contractfor coronavirus testing at its Lighthouse labs People arriving in the UK from abroad may soon be able to end their 14-day self-isolation early, withplans for a testing system being considered by a new taskforce National 5 examsare to be cancelled in Scotland in 2021and replaced with teacher assessments and coursework SOCIAL DISTANCING:How have rules on meeting friends changed?

"Mr Trump takes off his mask on his arrival back at the White House from hospital US President Donald Trump says he feels great after his Covid-19 illness, describing it as ""a blessing from God"". Mr Trump returned to the Oval Office on Wednesday, officials said, less than a week after testing positive. The president has had no Covid-19 symptoms for more than 24 hours and has been fever-free for more than four days, his doctor, Sean Conley, said. In a video message on Wednesday, Mr Trump said all Americans should have access to the treatments he was given. Mr Trump also promised to provide the drugs produced by Regeneron Pharmaceuticals free of charge. He said the experimental antibody cocktail he was given last week was a cure rather than a therapeutic measure, adding that hundreds of thousands of doses were nearly ready.

In case you missed them, here are some of the main developments from around the world today. All teaching at Newcastle and Northumbria universities will switch online from Thursday for a minimum of three weeks after hundreds of students tested positive for Covid-19. More than 750 Northumbria University students have tested positive for the virus as have more than 100 students and staff at Newcastle University. They join the University of Manchester, Manchester Metropolitan University and the University of Sheffield which have switched to online learning to protect the health of students and staff. Sheffield Hallam University has also decided to increase the number of online lessons it offers over the next two weeks after it recorded 373 cases of Covid-19 among students and staff. The Newcastle universities said they made the decision in consultation with the area's director of public health and the city council. Staff at Northumbria had called on vice-chancellor Andrew Wathey to resign as University and College Union (UCU) members agreed toballot for industrial action over safety concerns. Laura KuenssbergPolitical editor However you look at the blizzard of statistics about the coronavirus, the disease is still spreading - despite town after town being placed under extra limits. Even beforeNicola Sturgeon's moves on Wednesdayto try to break the spread in Scotland, ministers in Westminster were looking at the next steps they would need to take to stop the acceleration of the virus. As we've reported, the government is likely to introduce a tiered approach to put different parts of the country with different spreads of the diseases into different categories. But the exact nature of the strictest form of restrictions are yet to be set in stone. It's a complicated equation. The Department of Health is worried about the spread of the disease, as well as other patients losing out on other treatments because of the focus on Covid. No 11 is fearful about the impact on the economy, which has already had a profound shock. And it's No 10's job to worry about all of it, then reach a conclusion.

As we reported a moment ago, the White Houseâs doctor said tests on President Trump had found âdetectable levelsâ of antibodies against Covid-19 in his body. But what are antibodies in the first place? Some experts see them as the ""warriors"" of the bodyâs immune system. When coronavirus infects your body, the immune system produces antibodies, which attach to the spikes of the virus, blocking it from entering your cells. This is why vaccines are considered so important to ending the pandemic. A vaccine stimulates your immune system to produce antibodies, exactly like it would if you were exposed to the disease, thus training the body to fight the virus. You canread more about the progress being made on vaccines against coronavirus here. As the charts show, the number of people with Covid-19 needing hospital treatment is highest in the north of England. The number of UK cases announced on Wednesday - 14,162 - was slightly down on Tuesday's figure. But the seven-day rolling average is still pointing upwards.  The number of people dying with Covid-19 is also increasing - but far less sharply. Jenny HillBBC Berlin correspondent A curfew has been imposed in Berlin to curb the spread of the virus People living in parts of Berlin and other coronavirus hotspots in Germany will be prohibited from staying in hotels in the rest of the country from Thursday. Senior politicians from each of the 16 German states met online today to discuss rising number of infections in the country. Nationwide, there were 2,828 new cases and 16 deaths recorded in the last 24 hours. Infections have been rising steadily since August in Germany, increasing by more than 2,000 a day recently,World Health Organization (WHO) data shows,external. The capital Berlin announced a late-night curfew on restaurants and bars on Tuesday. Four districts of Berlin are particularly badly affected and are among at least seven so-called hotspots, where cases exceed 50 per 100,000 people for seven days. President Donald Trump has been ""symptom-free for over 24 hours"" and has not needed extra oxygen since he was admitted to hospital with Covid-19, the White House's physician has said. In a memo, Dr Sean Conley said the president's vital signs, including his oxygen saturation, ""remain stable and within a normal range"". The president told the physician this morning ""I feel great!"", the memo says. ""He's now been fever-free for more than four days,"" the doctor said, adding that tests showed Trump has developed antibodies against the virus. Allow Twitter content?

Experts fear the coronavirus situation in Iran could be much worse than official figures show The daily coronavirus death toll is on the worrying trajectory in Iran, where a record 239 died with Covid-19 in the past 24 hours. That increase brings Iranâs overall death toll to 27,658 since the pandemic began, the countryâs health ministry reported on Wednesday. It has the highest official death toll and confirmed number of infections in the Middle East, according to Johns Hopkins University. A further 4,019 cases were also registered on 7 October, pushing the total number of people who have officially tested positive in the country to 483,844. Today's rise in infections is the second highest since the outbreak began, the highest being 4,151 a day earlier. Authorities have attributed the rise in cases to an increase in testing and people flouting social-distancing rules, butanalysis by BBC Reality Checkreveals a more nuanced picture. Iran has the highest number of coronavirus cases in the Middle East Antonin Panenka's cheeky winning penalty technique has been copied by some of the game's greats Czech football legend Antonin Panenka, who scored an audacious winning penalty to see Czechoslovakia win the 1976 European Championships, has been admitted to hospital with Covid-19, his former club has announced. In a tweet, Czech club Bohemians Praha 1905 said the former attacking midfielder was in intensive care, describing his condition as ""serious"". Bohemians said the 71-year-old had been connected to a machine but did not specify whether it was a mechanical ventilator or life support machine. Panenka's penalty against West Germany - a cheeky, slow chip as the goalkeeper went the wrong way - has since been emulated by numerous players, and is now known simply as a ""Panenka"".

Italy's government is moving to make masks compulsory in outdoor spaces Italy has recorded 3,678 new coronavirus infections over the past 24 hours, the biggest daily rise since mid-April when the country was under a national lockdown. It was the steepest 24-hour rise since 17 April, when 3,786 new infections were reported,according to the World Health Organization (WHO),external. In recent weeks, coronavirus infections have been rising at a steadier rate than during the first wave of the pandemic, when the Italian government imposed one of the strictest nationwide lockdowns in the world. That lockdown inflicted heavy economic costs, but brought contagion under control by the summer, allowing the government to reopen restaurants, bars and shops. Now, as winter approaches and indoor gatherings become more common, the virus is spreading once again, a trend seen across Europe. However, there are still far fewer daily infections in Italy than elsewhere in Europe, with France, Spain and the UK all registering thousands more cases per day.

President Trump returned to the White House on Monday night Earlier we reported comments by White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow, who said President Trump had returned to work at the Oval Office as he recuperates from Covid-19. Speaking to CNBC, Kudlow said ""the president actually showed up in the Oval Office yesterday with extra precautions"" but refused to go into specifics when asked if Trump had worn a mask. Moments later, those remarks were contradicted by a top aide to the president. ""While the President wanted to be in the Oval Office yesterday, he was not there - he stayed back in the residence working from there,"" tweeted Ben Williamson, a spokesman for the president.

In a further clarification, White House chief of staff Mark Meadows said Kudlow misspoke. Meadows said staff were still preparing for Trumpâs return to the Oval Office - less than a week after his Covid-19 diagnosis was announced on 2 October. âIf he decides to go to the Oval we've got safety protocols there,â Meadows said. Confusion over messaging has been a common theme since Trump's diagnosis, with White House officials and doctors giving conflicting information on the president's condition and the timeline of his illness. Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent On Tuesday it was revealed hospital admissions in England linked to Covid had jumped by a quarter in a day. But the latest daily figures show that has not been repeated â the numbers admitted actually show a small drop to 472. The North West, North East and Yorkshire are once again the worst hit areas. But the figures still suggest admissions are doubling around every two weeks. That is a worrying trend, but is a long way from the rapid rises seen in the spring when the UK hit 3,000 admissions a day very quickly. Admissions for respiratory illnesses always climb at this time of year. By December you would expect to see 1,000 people a day taken in to hospital for conditions such as flu. What we do not know yet is whether flu and other respiratory viruses are going to have the same impact they do normally or by how much Covid hospitalisations will continue to rise. Admissions are, arguably, the most important measure we have. They are a sign of how many people are actually seriously ill with the virus and provide important information about the pressure the NHS is under. A pub owner has warned new restrictions on the hospitality sector in Scotland are a ""nightmare"", despite saying that the measures were ""inevitable"". Steve Whiting, owner of the Halfway House pub in Edinburgh, said: ""It's been an incredibly difficult time for the hospitality sector, first we had the social distancing then we had the curfew now we have a two-week shutdown."" He said many cafes and pubs would have to lose stock and it would cause issues with staffing. ""It is just a nightmare for hospitality,"" he said. Mr Whiting, who has had to make three staff members redundant, said small businesses would need further financial support. Scotland's Education Secretary John Swinney said that ""we cannot plan on business as usual"" but there would not be an algorithm to decide grades. He said: ""First and foremost, awards will not be given â or taken away - on the basis of a statistical model nor on the basis of a schoolâs past performance. There will be no algorithm."" Mr Swinney and First Minister Nicola Sturgeonapologised earlier this yearafter an algorithm downgraded 125,000 grades, with results being ""stacked against"" pupils in more deprived areas. Mr Swinney said not having National 5 exams - normally sat by pupils aged 15 and 16 - would mean that a higher and advanced higher exam diet could be created to be as safe as it could be. ""The exams that determine most people's future path into work, college or university can go ahead as long as the public health guidance allows it,"" he said He said the additional time freed up by cancelling the National 5 exams could be used to make up in lost education time from this academic year. Advanced Higher and Higher exams will now begin on 13 May, later than usual. Pence's team had resisted the installation of plexiglass panels Anticipation is building for the first and only vice-presidential debate between Vice-President Mike Pence and Democratic challenger Kamala Harris in Salt Lake City, Utah, on Wednesday night. When the pair lock horns on stage, thereâll be more than just political divisions on display. Wearing masks, Harris and Pence will be seated more than 3.7m (12ft) apart, each with a plexiglass screen in front of them to mitigate the risk of coronavirus transmission. Event staff were seen erecting the plexiglass partitions on the debate stage. Harris requested for there to be panels between her and Pence Pence's team had opposed the barriers, deeming them unnecessary, but on Tuesday night agreed to have them installed. The dispute came amida growing number of positive cases among the inner circle of President Trump, who is continuing his recovery from Covid-19 at the White House. Both Pence and Harris have tested negative for coronavirus in recent days. At their debate, guests will be required to wear masks at all times and undergo coronavirus checks upon entry to the venue. The BBC will be running a live page of tonight's debate, so check back in with the website a few hours from now if you want live coverage of all the twists and turns.

"Covid restrictions are to be further tightened in parts of England early next week, with the closure of pubs and restaurants a possibility in the worst-affected areas, the BBC has been told. There could also be a ban on overnight stays away from home in these areas. A final decision on the time period or extent of potential closures has not yet been made. The government is also likely to introducea three-tier system for local lockdowns. Under the system, different parts of the country would be placed in different categories - although ministers are still discussing the precise details of the toughest level of restrictions over the next couple of days. A formal announcement is not likely to come until Monday, according to BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg. Check the Covid rules where you live What is the risk of Covid overwhelming the NHS? Do local lockdowns stop the spread of Covid? Meanwhile, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmerhas challenged the government to publish the scientific evidence behind the 22:00 closing time for pubs and restaurants- and refused to say whether his party would vote in support of the measure in Parliament next week. Communities Secretary Robert Jenrick said there was ""evidence hospitality plays a role"" in spreading the virus. But pressed on whether the government would publish this evidence, he told the BBC: ""It is commonsensical that the longer you stay in pubs and restaurants, the more likely you are to come into contact with other individuals. ""The more drinks that people have, the more likely that some people are to break the rules."" He added that it was right to ""take action decisively, rather than waiting for the most detailed epidemiological evidence to emerge"". On the possibility of additional restrictions for some parts of England, Mr Jenrick said the government was ""currently considering what steps to take"" and the precise measures for different areas would be announced ""in the coming days"". He did not rule out pubs being closed but said measures would be ""proportionate and localised"". He added that the government was trying to give ""greater consistency on rules so they're easier to understand"" and was working on ""slightly broader canvases of regions or cities and counties to avoid differences in people's daily lives if they drive over the border"". Pubs and restaurants across Central Scotland have already been told they will have to close It comes assignificant new measures are introduced in Scotland. From Friday, all pubs and restaurants across central Scotland, including Glasgow and Edinburgh, are to close, while in the rest of Scotland hospitality venues must shut at 18:00 BST and alcohol can only be served outdoors. Industry leaders are warningthe measures could be the final straw for many businesses. On Wednesday the number of UK cases rose by 14,162, with a further 70 deaths reported. The planned tightening of restrictions in parts of England follows rising infection rates across much of the country, with medical leaders warning the NHS is at risk of becoming overwhelmed. Liverpool, Manchester and Newcastle upon Tyne have the highest infection rates in the country. A government source told the BBC the situation in the north-west and north-east of England was ""very troubling"", with growing numbers of hospital admissions and more elderly people in intensive care. These areas will be placed into the top tier of restrictions, with an announcement possibly as early as Monday, in a new system called the Local Covid Alert Level. But there remains a debate within cabinet over how far the restrictions in the top tier should go, with some in No 10 arguing for measures like those in Scotland. The plan is for schools to remain open in all circumstances. The Labour mayor of Greater Manchester, Andy Burnham, reacted angrily to the reports, tweeting: ""No discussion. No consultation. Millions of lives affected by Whitehall diktat. It is proving impossible to deal with this government."" It's a complicated equation. The Department of Health is worried about the spread of the disease, as well as other patients losing out on other treatments because of the focus on Covid. No 11 is fearful about the impact on the economy, which has already had a profound shock. And it's No 10's job to worry about all of it, then reach a conclusion. But Boris Johnson also knows that his own MPs and the opposition parties are more and more sceptical as each day passes about what the government proposes. It's clear that shutting pubs and restaurants is a possibility - the ""circuit breaker"" that we have talked about on here lots of times. But there are many questions still to be settled. Read more from Laura here. Under the new system, all areas would be subject to the current England-wide restrictions, but there would be much more robust measures for the top tier - the one with the highest infection rates. There are already tighter restrictions in parts of the north-east and north-west of England, Birmingham and Leicester, where the rate of infection has been rising. But there are currently no extra restrictions for hospitality venues in these areas beyond those in force nationally, such as the 22:00 closing time for pubs and restaurants. The Treasury is looking at providing financial support to the industry in the worst-hit areas, and a memo seen by the BBC shows plans for additional money for local authorities. They would get Â£1 per head of population if placed into tier two, and Â£2 per head for tier three. Kate Nicholls, chief executive of UK Hospitality, said if venues were forced to close the industry would need a return to a full furlough scheme and additional financial support. She said the Â£40m of support announced for hospitality venues by the Scottish government, when shared between 16,000 premises, equated to just over Â£2,000 each, which ""barely keeps the lights on, let alone saving jobs"". The planned changes come as medical leaders warn that rising infection levels across the country could leave the NHS ""unable to cope"". The Academy of Medical Colleges, which represents the UK and Ireland's 24 medical royal colleges, called on people to abide ""strictly"" to coronavirus measures to prevent NHS services from becoming overwhelmed. Helen Stokes-Lampard, chair of the academy, said: ""Given the recent dramatic spike in both the number of cases and hospital admissions it is clear that we could soon be back to where we were in April if we are not all extremely careful."" She told BBC Breakfast that while there were hotspots in the north-east and north-west of England, a lot of cities were now seeing ""serious problems"" and the virus was ""working further south"". In other developments: Police in England and Wales are being given an extra Â£30m by the government to enforce coronavirus restrictions, while another Â£30m will be provided for Covid marshals to help ensure rules are followed in English council areas The UK government has agreed to pay up to Â£2mto settle a lawsuit over how it selected an IT contractfor coronavirus testing at its Lighthouse labs People arriving in the UK from abroad may soon be able to end their 14-day self-isolation early, withplans for a testing system being considered by a new taskforce National 5 examsare to be cancelled in Scotland in 2021and replaced with teacher assessments and coursework SOCIAL DISTANCING:How have rules on meeting friends changed?

"Children are not able to properly understand the lifelong consequences of taking puberty blockers and cross-sex hormones, the High Court has been told. The case has been brought by Keira Bell, who began taking puberty blockers when she was 16, and the mother of a 16-year-old awaiting treatment. They are taking action against the UK's only children's NHS gender clinic, run by the Tavistock and Portman NHS Trust. The landmark hearing in London is expected to last two days. The Gender Identity Development Service (GIDS), based in Hampstead, north-west London, is a specialised unit for young people who have difficulties with their gender identity. Lawyers representing Ms Bell, 23, and Mrs A, whose autistic child is currently on the waiting list for treatment at the service, argue that children going through puberty are ""not capable of properly understanding the nature and effects of hormone blockers"". They argue there is ""a very high likelihood"" that children who start taking hormone blockers will later begin taking cross-sex hormones, which they say cause ""irreversible changes"". What are puberty blockers? NHS gender clinic 'should have challenged me more' Ms Bell and Mrs A are asking the High Court to rule that it is unlawful for children who wish to undergo gender reassignment to be prescribed hormone blockers without an order from the court that such treatment is in their ""best interests"". Jeremy Hyam QC, who is representing the pair at the hearing, said: ""The use of hormone blockers to address gender dysphoria does not have any adequate evidence base to support it."" He said the effect of hormone blockers ""on the intensity, duration and outcome of adolescent development is largely unknown"", adding: ""There is evidence that hormone blockers can have significant side-effects, including loss of fertility and sexual function and decreased bone density."" In written submissions, Mr Hyam said: ""That children are not capable of giving informed consent to undergo a type of medical intervention about which the evidence base is poor, the risks and potential side-effects are still largely unknown, and which is likely to set them on a path towards permanent and life-altering physical, psychological, emotional and developmental consequences... is the common-sense and obvious position."" He told the court that referrals to GIDS had seen a ""20-fold increase"", rising from 97 in 2009 to 2,590 in 2018. Keira Bell, 23, is taking action against the Tavistock and Portman NHS Trust In a witness statement before the court, Ms Bell, who began ""detransitioning"" last year, said: ""I made a brash decision as a teenager, as a lot of teenagers do, trying to find confidence and happiness, except now the rest of my life will be negatively affected."" She added: ""Transition was a very temporary, superficial fix for a very complex identity issue."" Fenella Morris QC, lawyer for the Tavistock and Portman NHS Trust, said the contention that children could not give informed consent to being prescribed hormone blockers was ""a radical proposition"". She argued in written submissions that the claimants sought to ""impose a blanket exclusion"" on children under the age of 18 to be able to consent to medical treatment. Ms Morris added the majority of children referred to GIDS between March 2019 and 2020 were over 12, with only 13 of the children referred being under the age of 13. In a written submission, she added their use ""has been widely researched and debated for three decades"", adding: ""It is a safe and reversible treatment with a well-established history."" This is a controversial case with deeply held views on all sides. At the heart of it is the complex question of whether a child under the age of 18 can give informed consent to treatment that Keira Bell's lawyers describe as ""experimental"" and ""life-altering"". They say that with some children prescribed puberty blockers as young as nine or 10 (although this is rare), they can't possibly know how they will feel as an adult if they face difficulties having a child or having a fulfilling sexual relationship. Lawyers for the Tavistock maintain there are careful checks and balances and, for years, such drugs have successfully given young people space to reflect before they transition. They are also likely to point to the many young transgender people who already have to wait years just to see a gender specialist and the deep distress that causes. Ms Morris also said the Tavistock and Portman NHS Trust referred children and young people experiencing gender dysphoria to University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust or Leeds Teaching Hospital NHS Trust. She argued that those two trusts were ""responsible"" for prescribing hormone blockers to children with gender dysphoria - not the Tavistock and Portman NHS Trust. Lawyers representing London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust and Leeds Teaching Hospital NHS Trust are expected to address the court on Thursday. It is expected that the judges hearing the case - Dame Victoria Sharp, Mr Justice Lewis and Mrs Justice Lieven - will reserve judgment to a later date. Correction 10th October 2020: This article originally included a quote from Fenella Morris QC about the use of hormone blockers, from agency reporting, which was subsequently found to be inaccurate.

"This video can not be played Keir Starmer says it is getting âridiculousâ with the prime minster unable to explain coronavirus restrictions Boris Johnson has been challenged to publish the scientific evidence behind the 10pm closing time for English pubs ahead of a vote by MPs next week. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said the public ""deserved to know"" the basis for the restriction and if it could not be justified the rule must be reviewed. Tory MPs opposed to the move may rebel in the Commons vote. The PM said the rationale behind it had not changed and it was designed to reduce the spread of the virus. The two party leaders clashed over the effectiveness and fairness of national and local Covid restrictions at Prime Minister's Questions, with Sir Keir accusing the PM of incompetence and the PM saying Labour had supported the government's position, then changed its stance. All pubs, bars, restaurants and other hospitality venues in England have been required to close at 10pm since 24 September, as part of a package of measures to try and contain a surge of new cases in the North of England. Ministers argue it has had a ""beneficial effect"" on the spread of the virus in areas where the restriction had already been tried - but it has become a lighting rod for dissatisfaction on the Tory benches about Covid restrictions. Do local lockdowns stop the spread of covid? 14,542 new cases announced on Tuesday What's the evidence for 10pm pub closing time? And regional leaders, including the mayors of Greater Manchester and London, have called for it to be reviewed amid concerns it has led to large crowds gathering outside venues in some cities after closing time. In other developments: Allpubs and restaurants across the central belt of Scotland- including in Glasgow and Edinburgh - are to shut for two weeks from Friday amid a tightening of restrictions Pub operator Greene King has announced it will shut dozens of pubs with the loss of 800 jobs. New restrictions aimed at slowing a surge in coronavirus cases are to be announced by Scotland's first minister Transport Secretary Grant Shapps has said he will outline a taskforce to implement a testing system on people arriving in the country from abroad Commons Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle has urged MPs to wear face coverings while walking around Parliament However you look at the blizzard of statistics about the coronavirus, the disease is still spreading - despite town after town being placed under extra limits. Even before Nicola Sturgeon's moves on Wednesday to try to break the spread in Scotland, ministers in SW1 were looking at the next steps they would need to take to stop the acceleration of the virus. As we've reported, the government is likely to introduce a tiered approach to put different parts of the country with different spreads of the diseases into different categories. But the exact nature of the strictest form of restrictions are yet to be set in stone. Read Laura's full blog Labour has said a vote on whether to keep or scrap the 10pm closing time is expected on Monday, although the government has not confirmed the date. Sir Keir refused to say which way Labour would vote, telling the BBC the PM ""needs to make his case"" about how the 10pm cut-off reduces transmission and ""the ball very firmly is in his court"". Speaking earlier in Parliament, he said: ""Is there a scientific basis for the 10pm rule? ""The public and Parliament deserve to know. If there is, why does the government do itself a favour and publish it? ""If not, why does the government not review the rule?"" 'Rule of six' doesn't make sense, say Tory MPs 14,542 new cases announced on Tuesday Greene King to close dozens of pubs and cut 800 jobs In response, Mr Johnson said ""the basis on which we set out the curtailment of hospitality was the basis on which he accepted it two weeks ago. ""And that is the reduce the spread of the virus and that is our objective."" The prime minister accused Labour of withdrawing its support for other restrictions, after its MPs were told to abstain in a vote on Tuesday on maintaining the rule of six limit on social gatherings. ""What kind of signal does this send to the people of the country about the robustness of the Labour Party and their willingness to enforce the restrictions?"" he added. During heated exchanges, the Labour leader urged the PM to be straight with the public about whether local lockdowns were working and to explain why some areas of the country were not being subject to restrictions despite having a higher proportion of cases than those targeted. He said cases were continuing to rise in 19 of the 20 local council areas which had been to subject to restrictions between the end of July and start of August - including Bradford, Oldham, Rochdale, Stockport and Wigan. The Labour leader said that in Burnley, infection rates were 21 per 100,000 people when restrictions were introduced, while now it is 434. In Bolton, it was 18 per 100,000, while now it is 255.

At the same time, he said no extra restrictions were being applied in the London borough of Hillingdon - which is home to the PM's Uxbridge and Ruislip constituency - despite it having recorded weekly figures as high as 62 cases per 100,000 people. This, he said, was a far higher figure than the rate of infection in Kirklees in West Yorkshire - 29 cases per 100,000 people - when restrictions were imposed there on 30 July ""The prime minister really needs to understand that local communities are angry and frustrated,"" he said. ""So will he level with the people of Bury, Burnley and Bolton and tell them: what does he think the central problem is that's causing this? ""The prime minister can't explain why an area goes into restrictions. He can't explain what the different restrictions are, and he can't explain how restrictions end."" Mr Johnson said the combination of local and national measures in place were needed to deal with the continued sharp rise in cases in Manchester and Liverpool but also the uptick in infections in the Midlands and London. ""The local and regional approach, combined with national measures, remains correct because two thirds of those admitted into hospital on Sunday were in the North East, North West and Yorkshire,"" he said. Sir Keir grilled the prime minister on the effectiveness and fairness of local restrictions. ""Twenty local areas have been under restrictions for two months, in 19 of those 20 areas infections rates have gone up,"" he said, citing new Labour Party analysis. The trends highlighted in the report for those areas are correct. In fact, only in Leicester did we see sustained declines in case rates during a local lockdown, but those rates quickly increased when restrictions were loosened. The issue with the Labour analysis is that a handful of the places mentioned have not actually been in local lockdowns for two complete months. For example, Oadby and Wigston did face additional restrictions at the end of June, but these were lifted after a month. They were only placed under restrictions again on 22 September. On another point, Sir Keir said areas in parts of the north of England had been placed into local restrictions at rates lower than those experienced in parts of the south which are not under any kind of lockdown. This is true: Bury, Tameside, Stockport and Wigan (to name a few) had case rates of between 20 and 30 per 100,000 people when they first went into lockdown. The London borough of Hillingdon - the prime minister's constituency - had rates of 46 cases per 100,000, while Redbridge had 57 and Barking and Dagenham 53, in the week ending the 27 September, according to Public Health England. And analysis by the BBC data team suggests that these rates have increased in the past week. RULES:What are the restrictions in Scotland?

"Sarah Forbes Bonetta, Queen Victoria's African goddaughter by artist Hannah Uzor, is on display at Osborne House A new painting of Queen Victoria's African goddaughter has gone on display as English Heritage said it would feature portraits of ""overlooked"" black figures connected with its sites. Sarah Forbes Bonetta was sold into slavery aged five and presented as a ""diplomatic gift"" to Captain Frederick Forbes in 1850 and brought to England. She then met Queen Victoria through the captain, who paid for her education. The painting is on show at the Isle of Wight's Osborne House. The picture is on display at the royal seaside palace, where the Queen once lived with Prince Albert and their nine children, to coincide with Black History Month. English Heritage is displaying a portrait of Bonetta as part of a plan to feature works of ""overlooked"" black figures connected with its sites The portrait, by artist Hannah Uzor, is based on a photograph and shows Ms Bonetta wearing her wedding dress. Ms Uzor said: ""To see Sarah return to Osborne - her godmother's home - is very satisfying and I hope my portrait will mean more people discover her story."" Breathing life into black British history Ms Bonetta named her first daughter after the Queen, who also became the child's godmother. Captain Forbes named her Sarah Forbes Bonetta, partly after his ship, the HMS Bonetta. He had visited the King of Dahomey - in what is now Benin - as a representative of Queen Victoria, on a mission to negotiate the suppression of slavery. Curatorial director of English Heritage Anna Eavis said: ""It's an extraordinary story. ""Britain had abolished the slave trade and was now on a mission to make sure the slave trade was abolished throughout the world. Captain Frederick Forbes, a naval captain, arrived at Dahomey to try and talk the King of Dahomey out of continuing with this trade. ""He wasn't successful but the king presented him with this little girl who was seven years old and an orphan.  Forbes took her back and presented her to Queen Victoria at Windsor Castle. ""Victoria was so affected by this little girl arriving she wrote about it in her diary and took her under her wing, paid for her education and took an interest in her and her daughter for the rest of their lives."" Ms Bonetta died in Madeira, aged 37, after becoming sick with tuberculosis. Her daughter Victoria received the news while visiting the Queen at Osborne. Artist Hannah Uzor with her painting of Sarah Forbes Bonetta English Heritage said from spring 2021 further portraits of black figures associated with its sites, whose stories like Ms Bonetta's which had been ""previously overlooked"", will go on display. The charity said: ""Black history is part of English history and, while we know we have more to do, English Heritage is committed to telling the story of England in full."" Ms Eavis added: ""There are a number of black figures from the past who have played significant roles at some of the historic sites in our care but their stories are not very well known. ""Starting with Sarah, our portraits project is one way we're bringing these stories to life and sharing them with our visitors."" Ms Bonetta's story was thesubject of a play released at the start of the year called The Gift. Other portraits set to go on display include Rome's African-born emperor Septimius Severus, who strengthened Hadrian's Wall, and James Chappell, a 17th Century servant at Kirby Hall in Northamptonshire, who saved the life of the country house's owner. The portrait being carried through the grounds of Osborne House Properties where visitors will find new information about connections to the slave trade will include Brodsworth Hall in South Yorkshire. Its former owner, Peter Thellusson, was not a slave trader himself but invested in slavery-related commodities and land. At Kenwood House, in London, visitors will learn about how rulings by former owner Lord Mansfield, as Lord Chief Justice, made a significant contribution along the road to abolition.

"Pub giant Greene King is cutting 800 jobs after deciding that tighter lockdown restrictions mean some pubs will have to close. It said 79 sites will stay closed for the time being, with about one third of these expected to be shut permanently. Coronavirus restrictions, such as the 10pm curfew, and the winding down of the furlough scheme was a ""challenge"" to trading, Green King said. It urged the government to do more for the struggling hospitality sector. Scotland's hospitality sector received a jolt on Wednesday when its government said it wouldclose all pubs and restaurants across central Scotlandunder new measures aimed at tackling a surge in coronavirus cases in the region. The 10pm closing time remains in place in England and Prime Minister Boris Johnson has been challenged to publish the scientific evidence behind that. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said the public ""deserved to know"" the basis for the restriction and if it could not be justified the rule must be reviewed. Tory MPs opposed to the move may rebel inthe Commons vote, which is scheduled for next week. An industry body warned on Tuesday thathalf a million hospitality jobscould go by the end of the year. Pubs and restaurants facing jobs cliff edge Cities' economies face decimation under lockdowns A spokeswoman for Greene King said: ""The continued tightening of the trading restrictions for pubs, which may last another six months, along with the changes to government support was always going to make it a challenge to reopen some of our pubs. ""Therefore, we have made the difficult decision not to reopen 79 sites, including the 11 Loch Fyne restaurants we announced last week. ""Around one-third will be closed permanently and we hope to be able to reopen the others in the future."" She added: ""We are working hard with our teams to try and find them a role in another of our pubs wherever possible."" Suffolk-based Greene King, which was bought by a Hong-Kong real estate giant last year, is one of the UK's biggest hospitality firms, with 3,100 pubs, restaurants and hotels across the UK. The hospitality sector has been struggling with government restrictions designed to slow the spread of coronavirus, including 10pm closing time for pubs, social distancing measures, and mandatory table service for food in licensed premises. Under the government's furlough scheme, workers put on leave have been able to get 80% of their pay, up to a maximum of Â£2,500 a month. But that scheme has been winding down and at the end of October will be replaced by the Job Support Scheme - a less generous wage support scheme. There are fears this will trigger large scale job cuts among businesses struggling to cover their costs. The company said it had a strong track record of redeploying people across its business, and had already identified a number of other opportunities for Loch Fyne employees from the 11 restaurants it said it would be closing last week. Last week, the boss of rival Fuller's said that about a tenth of its almost-5,000 employees could face redundancy without further state support. The bosses of London-focused groups Young's and City Pub Group also warned that they might have to get rid of hundreds of roles when furlough ends later this month. Are you a Greene King employee?

"Emmanuelle Charpentier (L) and Jennifer Doudna began a formidable partnership in 2011 Two scientists have been awarded the 2020 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for developing the tools to edit DNA. Emmanuelle Charpentier and Jennifer Doudna are the first two women to share the prize, which honours their work on the technology of genome editing. Their discovery, known as Crispr-Cas9 ""genetic scissors"", is a way of making specific and precise changes to the DNA contained in living cells. They will split the prize money of 10 million krona (Â£861,200; $1,110,400). Biological chemist Pernilla Wittung-Stafshede, commented: ""The ability to cut DNA where you want has revolutionised the life sciences."" Listen to the BBC's The Life Scientific: Jennifer Doudna Not only has the women's technology been transformative for basic research, it could also be used to treat inherited illnesses. Prof Charpentier, from the Max Planck Unit for the Science of Pathogens in Berlin, said it was an emotional moment when she learned about the award. ""When it happens, you're very surprised, and you think it's not real. But obviously it's real,"" she said. Hepatitis C discovery wins the Nobel Prize Black hole breakthroughs win Nobel physics prize On being one of the first two women to share the prize, Prof Charpentier said: ""I wish that this will provide a positive message specifically for young girls who would like to follow the path of science... and to show them that women in science can also have an impact with the research they are performing."" She continued: ""This is not just for women, but we see a clear lack of interest in following a scientific path, which is very worrying."" Artwork: The pair developed tools that allow the code of life to be rewritten During Prof Charpentier's studies of the bacteriumStreptococcus pyogenes, she discovered a previously unknown molecule called tracrRNA. Her work showed that tracrRNA is part of the organism's system of immune defence. This system, known as Crispr-Cas, disarms viruses by cleaving their DNA - like genetic scissors. In 2011, the same year she published this work, Prof Charpentier began a collaboration with Prof Doudna, from the University of California, Berkeley. The two had been introduced by a colleague of Doudna's at a cafe in Puerto Rico, where the scientists were attending a conference. And it was on the following day, during a walk through the streets of the island's capital, San Juan, that Prof Charpentier proposed the idea of joining forces. This video can not be played Fergus Walsh explains how gene editing works Together, they recreated the bacterium's genetic scissors in a test tube. They also simplified the scissors' molecular components so they were easier to use. In their natural form, the bacterial scissors recognise DNA from viruses. But Charpentier and Doudna showed that they could be reprogrammed to cut any DNA molecule at a predetermined site, publishing their findings in a landmark 2012 paper. The breakthrough DNA snipping technology allowed the ""code of life"" to be rewritten. UK approves embryo 'gene editing' First gene-editing in human body attempt Charpentier and Doudna are the first two women to share the chemistry prize Since the two scientists discovered the Crispr-Cas9 genetic scissors, their use has exploded. The tool has contributed to many important discoveries in basic research; and, in medicine, clinical trials of new cancer therapies are underway. The technology also holds the promise of being able to treat or even cure inherited diseases. It is currently being investigated for its potential to treat sickle cell anaemia, a blood disorder that affects millions of people worldwide. But without regulation, some fear Crispr could equally be used to create ""designer babies"", opening up an ethical minefield. If genome-edited children grow up and have children, any alterations to their genomes could be passed down through the generations - introducing lasting changes to the human population. Last year, Chinese scientistHe Jiankui was jailed for three yearsafter creating the world's first gene-edited human babies. He was convicted of violating a government ban by carrying out his own experiments on human embryos, to try to give them protection against HIV. This video can not be played Prof Emmanuelle Charpentier on the benefits offered by the CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing system It had been thought a Nobel for this revolutionary science would not be awarded for many years because the technique is also the subject of a long-running patent battle in the US. The dispute involves Charpentier and Doudna's group at the University of California, Berkeley, and a team at MIT and Harvard's Broad Institute in Cambridge, Massachusetts. The disagreement centres on the use of the Crispr technique in eukaryotic cells - those cells that bundle their DNA in a nucleus. It is in such cells, which are found in higher animals, that the most profitable future applications will exist. The competing institutions claim their scientists made the crucial, most relevant advances. Emmanuelle Charpentier was born in 1968 in Juvisy-sur-Orge, France. She obtained her PhD while at the Institut Pasteur in Paris and subsequently worked at scientific institutes in the US, Austria, Sweden and Germany - in addition to her native France. Jennifer Doudna was born in 1964 in Washington DC but spent much of her childhood in Hilo, Hawaii. She was awarded her PhD by Harvard Medical School. This year is the first time any of the science prizes has been awarded to two women without a male collaborator also listed on the award.

"The Leeds businessman Manni Hussain handed over 45 properties after investigators used an Unexplained Wealth Order Around Â£10m of property has been surrendered in a major victory against some of northern England's most dangerous criminals. The apartments and homes were given up to the National Crime Agency by a Leeds businessman who investigators suspect of being a major money-launderer. The NCA says Mansoor Mahmood Hussain acted for gangsters, including a murderer and drug trafficker. The agency believes he laundered their profits through a property empire. Over two decades, Mr Hussain, known as Manni, developed his portfolio across West Yorkshire, Cheshire and London while posing as a legitimate businessman. His social media accounts show him living a luxury lifestyle involving high-performance cars, executive jets, super-yachts and appearances at VIP events attended by celebrities. He filled his timeline with pictures of the famous - although there is no suggestion that any of VIPs he posed with knew who he was. VIP events: Mr Hussain showed off his purported lifestyle on social media. Here with BeyoncÃ©... While the 40-year-old has never been convicted of a crime, investigators say they had intelligence linking him to serious gangsters - but could not obtain the detailed evidence needed for charges of money laundering. Instead, in 2019, they turned to the relatively new power of an Unexplained Wealth Order which required the businessman to open his books and show how his wealth had come from legitimate sources. The NCA has now announced that Mr Hussain has given up fighting the case against him and has agreed a settlement in which he has handed over the vast majority of his empire - 45 properties, apartments, offices and homes. The settlement also includes the brand name Poundworld, which Mr Hussain bought after the original chain's demise. As part of the settlement, the NCA has left him with four small properties that are still mortgaged, and cash in a bank account that was not part of the original investigation. ....Grabbing a picture with Meghan Markle Graeme Biggar, head of economic crime at the NCA, said: ""This case is a milestone, demonstrating the power of Unexplained Wealth Orders, with significant implications for how we pursue illicit finance in the UK. ""This ground-breaking investigation has recovered millions of pounds worth of criminally-obtained property. ""It is crucial for the economic health of local communities such as Leeds, and for the country as a whole, that we ensure property and other assets are held legitimately."" ...And hobnobbing with Simon Cowell The biggest single property handed over to the NCA is a high-specification apartment and office development, Cubic, on the outskirts of Leeds, which Mr Hussain wholly owned through one of his many companies. The other properties include a home on one of the city's most expensive roads, an apartment opposite Harrods in London and terraced housing in Leeds and Bradford. Once all the property is eventually sold, the profits will be split 50/50 between the investigatory agency and central government. In High Court legal papers, the NCA said it believed the seed money for Cubic's development and other property purchases must have come from Mr Hussain's criminal associates because they could find no legitimate source for his wealth. He had paid virtually no income tax in some years and many of his 77 companies were dormant. The court was told Mr Hussain was thought to be a ""clean skin"" - a businessman free of convictions, acting as a professional money-launderer. Today the NCA said one of the developer's closest associates was Bradford gangster Mohammed Nisar Khan, known on the street as ""Meggy"". Last yearhe was jailed for life for murder- and investigators have long considered him one of the most significant organised crime bosses in northern England, involved in drug and firearms trafficking operations. ""Meggy"" Khan: Close associate of the property developer Mr Hussain has been close to Mohammed Khan since 2005 and frequently drove him to and from court, according to evidence gathered by investigators. He also paid a Â£134,000 confiscation order for Khan's brother, Shamsher, who had been separately convicted of money laundering. The NCA also said that Dennis Slade, who once headed an armed robbery gang, stayed rent-free in Mr Hussain's seven-bedroom Leeds home - one of the properties he's now surrendered. This seven-bedroom home on Sandmoor Drive in Leeds has been handed over to the NCA The highly unusual outcome of the investigation - including the settlement leaving the target with some property - comes after the future of the UWO powers was in doubt. Of the four cases launched since the orders were created, two are still being fought through the courts while the NCA lost the third after the High Court ruled the individuals being targeted had no case to answer. The NCA today defended the decision to settle the Hussain case, saying Manni Hussain had been left with virtually nothing other than heavily mortgaged properties - and it had saved the taxpayer time and money by discouraging him from launching a potentially long and expensive legal battle. Investigators say that the settlement included no promise to Mr Hussain that he would not be investigated again in the future. Duncan Hames of Transparency International, an anti-corruption and white collar crime campaign group that lobbied for the introduction of UWOs, welcomed the outcome of the case. ""What's important is that there is a high level of transparency so people can see justice being done,"" said Mr Hames. ""Given the challenges on the court system, we need to be grateful when cases are brought to a conclusion - but we need to see many more of them."" The BBC has attempted to contact Mr Hussain for comment.

"Children are not able to properly understand the lifelong consequences of taking puberty blockers and cross-sex hormones, the High Court has been told. The case has been brought by Keira Bell, who began taking puberty blockers when she was 16, and the mother of a 16-year-old awaiting treatment. They are taking action against the UK's only children's NHS gender clinic, run by the Tavistock and Portman NHS Trust. The landmark hearing in London is expected to last two days. The Gender Identity Development Service (GIDS), based in Hampstead, north-west London, is a specialised unit for young people who have difficulties with their gender identity. Lawyers representing Ms Bell, 23, and Mrs A, whose autistic child is currently on the waiting list for treatment at the service, argue that children going through puberty are ""not capable of properly understanding the nature and effects of hormone blockers"". They argue there is ""a very high likelihood"" that children who start taking hormone blockers will later begin taking cross-sex hormones, which they say cause ""irreversible changes"". What are puberty blockers? NHS gender clinic 'should have challenged me more' Ms Bell and Mrs A are asking the High Court to rule that it is unlawful for children who wish to undergo gender reassignment to be prescribed hormone blockers without an order from the court that such treatment is in their ""best interests"". Jeremy Hyam QC, who is representing the pair at the hearing, said: ""The use of hormone blockers to address gender dysphoria does not have any adequate evidence base to support it."" He said the effect of hormone blockers ""on the intensity, duration and outcome of adolescent development is largely unknown"", adding: ""There is evidence that hormone blockers can have significant side-effects, including loss of fertility and sexual function and decreased bone density."" In written submissions, Mr Hyam said: ""That children are not capable of giving informed consent to undergo a type of medical intervention about which the evidence base is poor, the risks and potential side-effects are still largely unknown, and which is likely to set them on a path towards permanent and life-altering physical, psychological, emotional and developmental consequences... is the common-sense and obvious position."" He told the court that referrals to GIDS had seen a ""20-fold increase"", rising from 97 in 2009 to 2,590 in 2018. Keira Bell, 23, is taking action against the Tavistock and Portman NHS Trust In a witness statement before the court, Ms Bell, who began ""detransitioning"" last year, said: ""I made a brash decision as a teenager, as a lot of teenagers do, trying to find confidence and happiness, except now the rest of my life will be negatively affected."" She added: ""Transition was a very temporary, superficial fix for a very complex identity issue."" Fenella Morris QC, lawyer for the Tavistock and Portman NHS Trust, said the contention that children could not give informed consent to being prescribed hormone blockers was ""a radical proposition"". She argued in written submissions that the claimants sought to ""impose a blanket exclusion"" on children under the age of 18 to be able to consent to medical treatment. Ms Morris added the majority of children referred to GIDS between March 2019 and 2020 were over 12, with only 13 of the children referred being under the age of 13. In a written submission, she added their use ""has been widely researched and debated for three decades"", adding: ""It is a safe and reversible treatment with a well-established history."" This is a controversial case with deeply held views on all sides. At the heart of it is the complex question of whether a child under the age of 18 can give informed consent to treatment that Keira Bell's lawyers describe as ""experimental"" and ""life-altering"". They say that with some children prescribed puberty blockers as young as nine or 10 (although this is rare), they can't possibly know how they will feel as an adult if they face difficulties having a child or having a fulfilling sexual relationship. Lawyers for the Tavistock maintain there are careful checks and balances and, for years, such drugs have successfully given young people space to reflect before they transition. They are also likely to point to the many young transgender people who already have to wait years just to see a gender specialist and the deep distress that causes. Ms Morris also said the Tavistock and Portman NHS Trust referred children and young people experiencing gender dysphoria to University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust or Leeds Teaching Hospital NHS Trust. She argued that those two trusts were ""responsible"" for prescribing hormone blockers to children with gender dysphoria - not the Tavistock and Portman NHS Trust. Lawyers representing London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust and Leeds Teaching Hospital NHS Trust are expected to address the court on Thursday. It is expected that the judges hearing the case - Dame Victoria Sharp, Mr Justice Lewis and Mrs Justice Lieven - will reserve judgment to a later date. Correction 10th October 2020: This article originally included a quote from Fenella Morris QC about the use of hormone blockers, from agency reporting, which was subsequently found to be inaccurate.

"Pubs, restaurants and visitor attractions are concerned about the possible impact of new restrictions on their businesses The Scottish government is expected to announce stricter restrictions on licensed premises as part of efforts to slow a surge in coronavirus cases. It is thought that the new rules may be focused on pubs and restaurants in areas with higher levels of the virus. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has already said the new measures will not be a return to full lockdown. The virus has been spreading particularly quickly in the central belt of Scotland. It is expected that the new rules will be primarily focused on ""hotspot"" areas, such as the Greater Glasgow and Clyde, Lanarkshire, Lothian, Forth Valley and Ayrshire and Arran health board areas. The Scottish Sun newspaper has said that a series of documents apparently giving details of the new rules for the hospitality sector have beenleaked to its journalists,external. Check the Covid restrictions where you are How many cases are there in your area? Live updates on Nicola Sturgeon's speech Ms Sturgeon will confirm the new measures in a speech to the Scottish Parliament at about 14:50 BST. The licensed trade has called on the Scottish government to provide financial support for any businesses that are affected. The first minister said in June that she believed Scotland was""not far away""from eliminating the virus. But the number of people testing positive has increased sharply in recent weeks - in keeping with some other parts of the UK and Europe - despite Scotland generally taking a more cautious approach to the virus than England. Figures released on Wednesday showed that Scotland recorded more than 1,000 new confirmed cases of the virus in a single day for the first time - although the country is doing far more testing now than at the height of the pandemic earlier in the year. About 730 new cases are being recorded every day in Scotland on average - compared with 285 a fortnight ago - with the number of people dying or being admitted to hospital also increasing. Across the UK, a further14,542 cases were confirmed on Tuesday,external- a figure that has trebled in a fortnight. Last month, people in Scotland were banned from visiting other homes, with strict limits also in force for outdoor meetings and a 22:00 curfew imposed for pubs and restaurants. Ms Sturgeon said on Tuesday that the rising number of cases meant ""additional targeted steps"" were now needed if the country was to attempt to bring the virus back under control before winter. When the 10pm pub curfew was announced a fortnight ago, Nicola Sturgeon made clear she would like to go further in restricting hospitality. The reason she gave for not doing so was the limited capacity of the Scottish government to financially support affected businesses. Talks with the UK government have not resolved that issue yet, but the Scottish government is sufficiently alarmed by rising case numbers that it has decided to act anyway. The trading hours and licensing conditions for pubs and restaurants are likely to be restricted further and these restrictions may be heaviest in the central belt of Scotland, where the prevalence of the virus is strongest. The details were being debated and decided at a special meeting of the Scottish cabinet this morning. Affected businesses are likely to be offered some additional financial help from the Scottish government, while it continues to press for further Treasury support. Today's Scotland-only measures may not amount to the ""short, sharp, shock"" of the much discussed ""circuit-breaker"" - but they may not be the last restrictions to be imposed this autumn either. Tourism and hospitality industry leaders have warned that many businesses will never recover from the impact of any further restrictions. But the first minister has said the new measures would seek to strike a balance between protecting health and the economy. She has already ruled out a nationwide travel ban or the possibility of people being told to stay at home, and has pledged that schools will only close for the duration of the October holidays. It seems likely the new restrictions will primarily be targeted at ""hotspot"" areas with high levels of the virus, potentially alongside some new but possibly less stringent national measures. This video can not be played The first minister said on Monday the new measures would not amount to the lockdown seen in March The rising number of cases in some cities was partly driven by a series of major outbreaks on university campuses - although the virus is increasingly being transmitted to older people too. Many more rural areas have seen far fewer cases - and have questioned the need for any new rules to apply to them. Paul Waterson, of the Scottish Licensed Trade Association, said the prospect of tighter restrictions following the 22:00 closure time for pubs and restaurants was already affecting the industry ""very badly"". He told BBC Breakfast that Scotland could lose about a third of its pubs and about 25% of staff - or 12,500 people. What might the new measures look like? Tourism and hospitality sectors fear new restrictions What new rules have been introduced in other countries? But he predicted that new restrictions could see these figure increase to two-thirds of premises and half of staff. ""To have more restrictions would really be a disaster, not only for pubs and bars but for the whole hospitality industry,"" he said. The Federation of Small Businesses said days of uncertainty about what new measures would be imposed had been ""unhelpful"" and had caused more emotional strain for employers and staff. It called on the Scottish government to outline what new support it would be offering to firms impacted by the restrictions, and warned not doing so would further erode the trust of the business community. The Scottish Conservatives have also called on the Scottish government to offer more than ""empty words"" to businesses, and said it was time for it to ""stop passing the buck back to the UK government"".

"This video can not be played Nicola Sturgeon announces tougher restrictions for pubs and restaurants All pubs and restaurants across central Scotland are to be closed under new measures aimed at tackling a surge in coronavirus cases. The new rules will apply to licensed premises across the central belt, including Glasgow and Edinburgh. Pubs and restaurants will be able to open in other parts of Scotland - but can only serve alcohol outdoors. The new rules, which will be in force from 18:00 on Friday until 25 October, apply to about 3.4 million people. They cover people living in the Greater Glasgow and Clyde, Lanarkshire, Forth Valley, Lothian and Ayrshire and Arran health board areas. What are Scotland's new lockdown rules? Shutting the pubs - what's the evidence? Check the Covid rules where you live First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said the restrictions were ""intended to be short, sharp action to arrest a worrying increase in infection"". She warned that without taking action, the country risks ""returning to the peak level of infection by the end of the month"". But she admitted that the new rules would be disruptive to many businesses and would be unwelcome to many people. The Scottish Hospitality Group, which includes many of the the country's best known pubs and restaurants, accused the first minister of ""effectively signing a death sentence"" for many businesses. And the Federation of Small Businesses said the move would have a major knock on impact across other parts of the economy, including tourism. Opposition parties have called for more detail on a Â£40m support package for affected business that was announced by Ms Sturgeon, and have questioned the need for the blanket closure of pubs and restaurants. The new rules for the five central belt areas are: all licensed premises - with the exception of hotels for residents - will be required to close indoors and outdoors, although takeaways will be permitted cafes which do not have an alcohol licence will be able to stay open until 18:00 snooker and pool halls, indoor bowling alleys, casinos and bingo halls will also close in the five health board areas for two weeks from 10 October contact sports for people aged 18 and over will be suspended for the next two weeks - with an exception for professional sports indoor group exercise activities will not be allowed, although the current rules will remain in place for under 18s and gyms can remain open for individual exercise outdoor live events will not be permitted for the next fortnight. There will be no travel ban in any of the areas, but people in the central belt have been urged to avoid public transport unless it is ""absolutely necessary"". And they have also been advised not to travel outside of the health board area they live in if they do not need to. Throughout the pandemic Scotland has tended to adopt a slightly more cautious approach than England. It has imposed more restrictions and lifted them more slowly in general. The latest move is in line with that trend. There is little difference in overall infection rates. Scotland has seen 85 cases per 100,000 in the past week, compared to England's 109. The measures imposed by the Scottish government are focussed on areas with the highest infection rates. But those places are some way below the levels seen in England's hotspots. Cities such as Liverpool, Manchester and Newcastle have seen around 500 cases per 100,000 people over the past week - that is more than twice the level of infection in Glasgow for example. But the differences between the two nations should not mask the growing concern there is in England about the infection rates, particularly in the north of country. Senior ministers and their advisers are today discussing whether extra steps are needed south of the border. The problem is action to supress the virus has negative consequences too. This much can be seen in the growing number of scientists and health expertswho are signing the Great Barrington Declarationwarning about the impact of Covid lockdown policies. In other parts of the country, pubs, bars, restaurants and cafes will be able to open indoors until 18:00 - but only to serve food and non-alcoholic drinks. However, they will be able to serve alcohol in outdoor settings such as beer gardens until 22:00, with the current rules on no more than six people from two households remaining in place. And the existing rules will continue to apply to weddings that have already been booked, and funerals, in all parts of Scotland. Ms Sturgeon said regulations would be introduced to extend the mandatory use of face coverings in indoor communal settings such as staff canteens and workplace corridors. Shops across Scotland will be asked to return to 2m physical distancing from this weekend, and to reintroduce measures such as one-way systems. It comes as Scotland recorded more than 1,000 new confirmed cases of the virus in a single day for the first time - although the country is doing far more testing now than at the height of the pandemic earlier in the year. The R number is currently believed to be higher in Scotland than in other UK nations, and the number of people dying or in hospital with the virus has increased over the past week. The number of UK cases rose by 14,162 on Wednesday. This was a slight drop on Tuesday's figure, but the seven-day rolling average is still pointing upwards. Speaking in the Scottish Parliament, Ms Sturgeon said the ""vast majority"" of pubs and restaurants had worked hard to ensure the safety of their staff and customers. Beer gardens outside of the central belt will be able to serve alcohol until 22:00 But she added: ""Indoor environments, where different households from different age groups can mix, inevitably present a risk of transmission. ""That risk can be increased in some hospitality premises if good ventilation is difficult, and if it is hard to control the movement of people. ""And the presence of alcohol can of course affect people's willingness to physically distance."" Scottish Conservative group leader Ruth Davidson criticised a lack of detail over the Â£40m support package that was announced by the first minister. Ms Davidson said: ""These businesses deserve better. They need to know how much they can apply for, when they can apply for it and how long they will have to wait before support reaches them. ""Those answers could have been provided today, but Nicola Sturgeon failed to do that."" And Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard said the government should target premises which break the rules ""instead of shutting down every single business"". The temporary shutdown of pubs and restaurants across central Scotland with a new 6pm curfew elsewhere are significant new restrictions. Together with the existing Scotland-wide ban on visiting other households, these add up to the toughest combination of measures in place across any of the four UK nations. The Scottish government has decided to take further action because it fears case numbers are rising so fast that without further action, spread would be back to March/April levels by the end of this month. The hospitality industry is not convinced there is sufficient evidence to justify pubs and restaurants being so heavily targeted. The new measures are temporary, partly because the Scottish government has limited scope to compensate businesses. It hopes the UK government can be persuaded to offer additional support for hard hit sectors in the coming weeks and that all four nations can agree a new system for assessing and responding to the coronavirus threat on a more localised basis.

"Pubs, restaurants and visitor attractions are concerned about the possible impact of new restrictions on their businesses The Scottish government is expected to announce stricter restrictions on licensed premises as part of efforts to slow a surge in coronavirus cases. It is thought that the new rules may be focused on pubs and restaurants in areas with higher levels of the virus. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has already said the new measures will not be a return to full lockdown. The virus has been spreading particularly quickly in the central belt of Scotland. It is expected that the new rules will be primarily focused on ""hotspot"" areas, such as the Greater Glasgow and Clyde, Lanarkshire, Lothian, Forth Valley and Ayrshire and Arran health board areas. The Scottish Sun newspaper has said that a series of documents apparently giving details of the new rules for the hospitality sector have beenleaked to its journalists,external. Check the Covid restrictions where you are How many cases are there in your area? Live updates on Nicola Sturgeon's speech Ms Sturgeon will confirm the new measures in a speech to the Scottish Parliament at about 14:50 BST. The licensed trade has called on the Scottish government to provide financial support for any businesses that are affected. The first minister said in June that she believed Scotland was""not far away""from eliminating the virus. But the number of people testing positive has increased sharply in recent weeks - in keeping with some other parts of the UK and Europe - despite Scotland generally taking a more cautious approach to the virus than England. Figures released on Wednesday showed that Scotland recorded more than 1,000 new confirmed cases of the virus in a single day for the first time - although the country is doing far more testing now than at the height of the pandemic earlier in the year. About 730 new cases are being recorded every day in Scotland on average - compared with 285 a fortnight ago - with the number of people dying or being admitted to hospital also increasing. Across the UK, a further14,542 cases were confirmed on Tuesday,external- a figure that has trebled in a fortnight. Last month, people in Scotland were banned from visiting other homes, with strict limits also in force for outdoor meetings and a 22:00 curfew imposed for pubs and restaurants. Ms Sturgeon said on Tuesday that the rising number of cases meant ""additional targeted steps"" were now needed if the country was to attempt to bring the virus back under control before winter. When the 10pm pub curfew was announced a fortnight ago, Nicola Sturgeon made clear she would like to go further in restricting hospitality. The reason she gave for not doing so was the limited capacity of the Scottish government to financially support affected businesses. Talks with the UK government have not resolved that issue yet, but the Scottish government is sufficiently alarmed by rising case numbers that it has decided to act anyway. The trading hours and licensing conditions for pubs and restaurants are likely to be restricted further and these restrictions may be heaviest in the central belt of Scotland, where the prevalence of the virus is strongest. The details were being debated and decided at a special meeting of the Scottish cabinet this morning. Affected businesses are likely to be offered some additional financial help from the Scottish government, while it continues to press for further Treasury support. Today's Scotland-only measures may not amount to the ""short, sharp, shock"" of the much discussed ""circuit-breaker"" - but they may not be the last restrictions to be imposed this autumn either. Tourism and hospitality industry leaders have warned that many businesses will never recover from the impact of any further restrictions. But the first minister has said the new measures would seek to strike a balance between protecting health and the economy. She has already ruled out a nationwide travel ban or the possibility of people being told to stay at home, and has pledged that schools will only close for the duration of the October holidays. It seems likely the new restrictions will primarily be targeted at ""hotspot"" areas with high levels of the virus, potentially alongside some new but possibly less stringent national measures. This video can not be played The first minister said on Monday the new measures would not amount to the lockdown seen in March The rising number of cases in some cities was partly driven by a series of major outbreaks on university campuses - although the virus is increasingly being transmitted to older people too. Many more rural areas have seen far fewer cases - and have questioned the need for any new rules to apply to them. Paul Waterson, of the Scottish Licensed Trade Association, said the prospect of tighter restrictions following the 22:00 closure time for pubs and restaurants was already affecting the industry ""very badly"". He told BBC Breakfast that Scotland could lose about a third of its pubs and about 25% of staff - or 12,500 people. What might the new measures look like? Tourism and hospitality sectors fear new restrictions What new rules have been introduced in other countries? But he predicted that new restrictions could see these figure increase to two-thirds of premises and half of staff. ""To have more restrictions would really be a disaster, not only for pubs and bars but for the whole hospitality industry,"" he said. The Federation of Small Businesses said days of uncertainty about what new measures would be imposed had been ""unhelpful"" and had caused more emotional strain for employers and staff. It called on the Scottish government to outline what new support it would be offering to firms impacted by the restrictions, and warned not doing so would further erode the trust of the business community. The Scottish Conservatives have also called on the Scottish government to offer more than ""empty words"" to businesses, and said it was time for it to ""stop passing the buck back to the UK government"".

"Pub giant Greene King is cutting 800 jobs after deciding that tighter lockdown restrictions mean some pubs will have to close. It said 79 sites will stay closed for the time being, with about one third of these expected to be shut permanently. Coronavirus restrictions, such as the 10pm curfew, and the winding down of the furlough scheme was a ""challenge"" to trading, Green King said. It urged the government to do more for the struggling hospitality sector. Scotland's hospitality sector received a jolt on Wednesday when its government said it wouldclose all pubs and restaurants across central Scotlandunder new measures aimed at tackling a surge in coronavirus cases in the region. The 10pm closing time remains in place in England and Prime Minister Boris Johnson has been challenged to publish the scientific evidence behind that. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said the public ""deserved to know"" the basis for the restriction and if it could not be justified the rule must be reviewed. Tory MPs opposed to the move may rebel inthe Commons vote, which is scheduled for next week. An industry body warned on Tuesday thathalf a million hospitality jobscould go by the end of the year. Pubs and restaurants facing jobs cliff edge Cities' economies face decimation under lockdowns A spokeswoman for Greene King said: ""The continued tightening of the trading restrictions for pubs, which may last another six months, along with the changes to government support was always going to make it a challenge to reopen some of our pubs. ""Therefore, we have made the difficult decision not to reopen 79 sites, including the 11 Loch Fyne restaurants we announced last week. ""Around one-third will be closed permanently and we hope to be able to reopen the others in the future."" She added: ""We are working hard with our teams to try and find them a role in another of our pubs wherever possible."" Suffolk-based Greene King, which was bought by a Hong-Kong real estate giant last year, is one of the UK's biggest hospitality firms, with 3,100 pubs, restaurants and hotels across the UK. The hospitality sector has been struggling with government restrictions designed to slow the spread of coronavirus, including 10pm closing time for pubs, social distancing measures, and mandatory table service for food in licensed premises. Under the government's furlough scheme, workers put on leave have been able to get 80% of their pay, up to a maximum of Â£2,500 a month. But that scheme has been winding down and at the end of October will be replaced by the Job Support Scheme - a less generous wage support scheme. There are fears this will trigger large scale job cuts among businesses struggling to cover their costs. The company said it had a strong track record of redeploying people across its business, and had already identified a number of other opportunities for Loch Fyne employees from the 11 restaurants it said it would be closing last week. Last week, the boss of rival Fuller's said that about a tenth of its almost-5,000 employees could face redundancy without further state support. The bosses of London-focused groups Young's and City Pub Group also warned that they might have to get rid of hundreds of roles when furlough ends later this month. Are you a Greene King employee?

"Emmanuelle Charpentier (L) and Jennifer Doudna began a formidable partnership in 2011 Two scientists have been awarded the 2020 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for developing the tools to edit DNA. Emmanuelle Charpentier and Jennifer Doudna are the first two women to share the prize, which honours their work on the technology of genome editing. Their discovery, known as Crispr-Cas9 ""genetic scissors"", is a way of making specific and precise changes to the DNA contained in living cells. They will split the prize money of 10 million krona (Â£861,200; $1,110,400). Biological chemist Pernilla Wittung-Stafshede, commented: ""The ability to cut DNA where you want has revolutionised the life sciences."" Listen to the BBC's The Life Scientific: Jennifer Doudna Not only has the women's technology been transformative for basic research, it could also be used to treat inherited illnesses. Prof Charpentier, from the Max Planck Unit for the Science of Pathogens in Berlin, said it was an emotional moment when she learned about the award. ""When it happens, you're very surprised, and you think it's not real. But obviously it's real,"" she said. Hepatitis C discovery wins the Nobel Prize Black hole breakthroughs win Nobel physics prize On being one of the first two women to share the prize, Prof Charpentier said: ""I wish that this will provide a positive message specifically for young girls who would like to follow the path of science... and to show them that women in science can also have an impact with the research they are performing."" She continued: ""This is not just for women, but we see a clear lack of interest in following a scientific path, which is very worrying."" Artwork: The pair developed tools that allow the code of life to be rewritten During Prof Charpentier's studies of the bacteriumStreptococcus pyogenes, she discovered a previously unknown molecule called tracrRNA. Her work showed that tracrRNA is part of the organism's system of immune defence. This system, known as Crispr-Cas, disarms viruses by cleaving their DNA - like genetic scissors. In 2011, the same year she published this work, Prof Charpentier began a collaboration with Prof Doudna, from the University of California, Berkeley. The two had been introduced by a colleague of Doudna's at a cafe in Puerto Rico, where the scientists were attending a conference. And it was on the following day, during a walk through the streets of the island's capital, San Juan, that Prof Charpentier proposed the idea of joining forces. This video can not be played Fergus Walsh explains how gene editing works Together, they recreated the bacterium's genetic scissors in a test tube. They also simplified the scissors' molecular components so they were easier to use. In their natural form, the bacterial scissors recognise DNA from viruses. But Charpentier and Doudna showed that they could be reprogrammed to cut any DNA molecule at a predetermined site, publishing their findings in a landmark 2012 paper. The breakthrough DNA snipping technology allowed the ""code of life"" to be rewritten. UK approves embryo 'gene editing' First gene-editing in human body attempt Charpentier and Doudna are the first two women to share the chemistry prize Since the two scientists discovered the Crispr-Cas9 genetic scissors, their use has exploded. The tool has contributed to many important discoveries in basic research; and, in medicine, clinical trials of new cancer therapies are underway. The technology also holds the promise of being able to treat or even cure inherited diseases. It is currently being investigated for its potential to treat sickle cell anaemia, a blood disorder that affects millions of people worldwide. But without regulation, some fear Crispr could equally be used to create ""designer babies"", opening up an ethical minefield. If genome-edited children grow up and have children, any alterations to their genomes could be passed down through the generations - introducing lasting changes to the human population. Last year, Chinese scientistHe Jiankui was jailed for three yearsafter creating the world's first gene-edited human babies. He was convicted of violating a government ban by carrying out his own experiments on human embryos, to try to give them protection against HIV. This video can not be played Prof Emmanuelle Charpentier on the benefits offered by the CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing system It had been thought a Nobel for this revolutionary science would not be awarded for many years because the technique is also the subject of a long-running patent battle in the US. The dispute involves Charpentier and Doudna's group at the University of California, Berkeley, and a team at MIT and Harvard's Broad Institute in Cambridge, Massachusetts. The disagreement centres on the use of the Crispr technique in eukaryotic cells - those cells that bundle their DNA in a nucleus. It is in such cells, which are found in higher animals, that the most profitable future applications will exist. The competing institutions claim their scientists made the crucial, most relevant advances. Emmanuelle Charpentier was born in 1968 in Juvisy-sur-Orge, France. She obtained her PhD while at the Institut Pasteur in Paris and subsequently worked at scientific institutes in the US, Austria, Sweden and Germany - in addition to her native France. Jennifer Doudna was born in 1964 in Washington DC but spent much of her childhood in Hilo, Hawaii. She was awarded her PhD by Harvard Medical School. This year is the first time any of the science prizes has been awarded to two women without a male collaborator also listed on the award.

This video can not be played Covid in Scotland: FM announces tougher rules on hospitality As our live page draws to a close, here are some of the headlines from across the UK today: Harris and Pence will debate from behind plexiglass panels on Wednesday night Weâre pausing our live coverage of the coronavirus pandemic soon. In case you missed them, here are some of the main developments from around the world today. All teaching at Newcastle and Northumbria universities will switch online from Thursday for a minimum of three weeks after hundreds of students tested positive for Covid-19. More than 750 Northumbria University students have tested positive for the virus as have more than 100 students and staff at Newcastle University. They join the University of Manchester, Manchester Metropolitan University and the University of Sheffield which have switched to online learning to protect the health of students and staff. Sheffield Hallam University has also decided to increase the number of online lessons it offers over the next two weeks after it recorded 373 cases of Covid-19 among students and staff. The Newcastle universities said they made the decision in consultation with the area's director of public health and the city council. Staff at Northumbria had called on vice-chancellor Andrew Wathey to resign as University and College Union (UCU) members agreed toballot for industrial action over safety concerns. Laura KuenssbergPolitical editor However you look at the blizzard of statistics about the coronavirus, the disease is still spreading - despite town after town being placed under extra limits. Even beforeNicola Sturgeon's moves on Wednesdayto try to break the spread in Scotland, ministers in Westminster were looking at the next steps they would need to take to stop the acceleration of the virus. As we've reported, the government is likely to introduce a tiered approach to put different parts of the country with different spreads of the diseases into different categories. But the exact nature of the strictest form of restrictions are yet to be set in stone. It's a complicated equation. The Department of Health is worried about the spread of the disease, as well as other patients losing out on other treatments because of the focus on Covid. No 11 is fearful about the impact on the economy, which has already had a profound shock. And it's No 10's job to worry about all of it, then reach a conclusion. It's clear that shutting pubs and restaurants is a possibility - the ""circuit breaker"" that we have talked about on here lots of times. But there are many questions still to be settled. Read more from Laura here The world-famous annual Parish Fashion Week has been held in the French capital - and this year's ""must-have"" was the face mask Among the many celebrities who decided to drop in was US tennis player Venus Williams (centre) The event ran from 28 September to 6 October - will this year's must-have still be on show in 2021? As we reported a moment ago, the White Houseâs doctor said tests on President Trump had found âdetectable levelsâ of antibodies against Covid-19 in his body. But what are antibodies in the first place? Some experts see them as the ""warriors"" of the bodyâs immune system. When coronavirus infects your body, the immune system produces antibodies, which attach to the spikes of the virus, blocking it from entering your cells. This is why vaccines are considered so important to ending the pandemic. A vaccine stimulates your immune system to produce antibodies, exactly like it would if you were exposed to the disease, thus training the body to fight the virus. You canread more about the progress being made on vaccines against coronavirus here. As the charts show, the number of people with Covid-19 needing hospital treatment is highest in the north of England. The number of UK cases announced on Wednesday - 14,162 - was slightly down on Tuesday's figure. But the seven-day rolling average is still pointing upwards.  The number of people dying with Covid-19 is also increasing - but far less sharply. Jenny HillBBC Berlin correspondent A curfew has been imposed in Berlin to curb the spread of the virus People living in parts of Berlin and other coronavirus hotspots in Germany will be prohibited from staying in hotels in the rest of the country from Thursday. Senior politicians from each of the 16 German states met online today to discuss rising number of infections in the country. Nationwide, there were 2,828 new cases and 16 deaths recorded in the last 24 hours. Infections have been rising steadily since August in Germany, increasing by more than 2,000 a day recently,World Health Organization (WHO) data shows,external. The capital Berlin announced a late-night curfew on restaurants and bars on Tuesday. Four districts of Berlin are particularly badly affected and are among at least seven so-called hotspots, where cases exceed 50 per 100,000 people for seven days. President Donald Trump has been ""symptom-free for over 24 hours"" and has not needed extra oxygen since he was admitted to hospital with Covid-19, the White House's physician has said. In a memo, Dr Sean Conley said the president's vital signs, including his oxygen saturation, ""remain stable and within a normal range"". The president told the physician this morning ""I feel great!"", the memo says. ""He's now been fever-free for more than four days,"" the doctor said, adding that tests showed Trump has developed antibodies against the virus. Allow Twitter content?

Experts fear the coronavirus situation in Iran could be much worse than official figures show The daily coronavirus death toll is on the worrying trajectory in Iran, where a record 239 died with Covid-19 in the past 24 hours. That increase brings Iranâs overall death toll to 27,658 since the pandemic began, the countryâs health ministry reported on Wednesday. It has the highest official death toll and confirmed number of infections in the Middle East, according to Johns Hopkins University. A further 4,019 cases were also registered on 7 October, pushing the total number of people who have officially tested positive in the country to 483,844. Today's rise in infections is the second highest since the outbreak began, the highest being 4,151 a day earlier. Authorities have attributed the rise in cases to an increase in testing and people flouting social-distancing rules, butanalysis by BBC Reality Checkreveals a more nuanced picture. Iran has the highest number of coronavirus cases in the Middle East Antonin Panenka's cheeky winning penalty technique has been copied by some of the game's greats Czech football legend Antonin Panenka, who scored an audacious winning penalty to see Czechoslovakia win the 1976 European Championships, has been admitted to hospital with Covid-19, his former club has announced. In a tweet, Czech club Bohemians Praha 1905 said the former attacking midfielder was in intensive care, describing his condition as ""serious"". Bohemians said the 71-year-old had been connected to a machine but did not specify whether it was a mechanical ventilator or life support machine. Panenka's penalty against West Germany - a cheeky, slow chip as the goalkeeper went the wrong way - has since been emulated by numerous players, and is now known simply as a ""Panenka"".

Italy's government is moving to make masks compulsory in outdoor spaces Italy has recorded 3,678 new coronavirus infections over the past 24 hours, the biggest daily rise since mid-April when the country was under a national lockdown. It was the steepest 24-hour rise since 17 April, when 3,786 new infections were reported,according to the World Health Organization (WHO),external. In recent weeks, coronavirus infections have been rising at a steadier rate than during the first wave of the pandemic, when the Italian government imposed one of the strictest nationwide lockdowns in the world. That lockdown inflicted heavy economic costs, but brought contagion under control by the summer, allowing the government to reopen restaurants, bars and shops. Now, as winter approaches and indoor gatherings become more common, the virus is spreading once again, a trend seen across Europe. However, there are still far fewer daily infections in Italy than elsewhere in Europe, with France, Spain and the UK all registering thousands more cases per day.

Education Secretary John Swinney said a full exam diet during the continuing coronavirus pandemic was ""too big a risk"". Schools are to remain open but Mr Swinney said it was likely students would still face disruption - meaning an ""alternative approach"" was needed. Watch his statement above. President Trump returned to the White House on Monday night Earlier we reported comments by White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow, who said President Trump had returned to work at the Oval Office as he recuperates from Covid-19. Speaking to CNBC, Kudlow said ""the president actually showed up in the Oval Office yesterday with extra precautions"" but refused to go into specifics when asked if Trump had worn a mask. Moments later, those remarks were contradicted by a top aide to the president. ""While the President wanted to be in the Oval Office yesterday, he was not there - he stayed back in the residence working from there,"" tweeted Ben Williamson, a spokesman for the president.

In a further clarification, White House chief of staff Mark Meadows said Kudlow misspoke. Meadows said staff were still preparing for Trumpâs return to the Oval Office - less than a week after his Covid-19 diagnosis was announced on 2 October. âIf he decides to go to the Oval we've got safety protocols there,â Meadows said. Confusion over messaging has been a common theme since Trump's diagnosis, with White House officials and doctors giving conflicting information on the president's condition and the timeline of his illness. Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent On Tuesday it was revealed hospital admissions in England linked to Covid had jumped by a quarter in a day. But the latest daily figures show that has not been repeated â the numbers admitted actually show a small drop to 472. The North West, North East and Yorkshire are once again the worst hit areas. But the figures still suggest admissions are doubling around every two weeks. That is a worrying trend, but is a long way from the rapid rises seen in the spring when the UK hit 3,000 admissions a day very quickly. Admissions for respiratory illnesses always climb at this time of year. By December you would expect to see 1,000 people a day taken in to hospital for conditions such as flu. What we do not know yet is whether flu and other respiratory viruses are going to have the same impact they do normally or by how much Covid hospitalisations will continue to rise. Admissions are, arguably, the most important measure we have. They are a sign of how many people are actually seriously ill with the virus and provide important information about the pressure the NHS is under. A pub owner has warned new restrictions on the hospitality sector in Scotland are a ""nightmare"", despite saying that the measures were ""inevitable"". Steve Whiting, owner of the Halfway House pub in Edinburgh, said: ""It's been an incredibly difficult time for the hospitality sector, first we had the social distancing then we had the curfew now we have a two-week shutdown."" He said many cafes and pubs would have to lose stock and it would cause issues with staffing. ""It is just a nightmare for hospitality,"" he said. Mr Whiting, who has had to make three staff members redundant, said small businesses would need further financial support. Scotland's Education Secretary John Swinney said that ""we cannot plan on business as usual"" but there would not be an algorithm to decide grades. He said: ""First and foremost, awards will not be given â or taken away - on the basis of a statistical model nor on the basis of a schoolâs past performance. There will be no algorithm."" Mr Swinney and First Minister Nicola Sturgeonapologised earlier this yearafter an algorithm downgraded 125,000 grades, with results being ""stacked against"" pupils in more deprived areas. Mr Swinney said not having National 5 exams - normally sat by pupils aged 15 and 16 - would mean that a higher and advanced higher exam diet could be created to be as safe as it could be. ""The exams that determine most people's future path into work, college or university can go ahead as long as the public health guidance allows it,"" he said He said the additional time freed up by cancelling the National 5 exams could be used to make up in lost education time from this academic year. Advanced Higher and Higher exams will now begin on 13 May, later than usual. Pence's team had resisted the installation of plexiglass panels Anticipation is building for the first and only vice-presidential debate between Vice-President Mike Pence and Democratic challenger Kamala Harris in Salt Lake City, Utah, on Wednesday night. When the pair lock horns on stage, thereâll be more than just political divisions on display. Wearing masks, Harris and Pence will be seated more than 3.7m (12ft) apart, each with a plexiglass screen in front of them to mitigate the risk of coronavirus transmission. Event staff were seen erecting the plexiglass partitions on the debate stage. Harris requested for there to be panels between her and Pence Pence's team had opposed the barriers, deeming them unnecessary, but on Tuesday night agreed to have them installed. The dispute came amida growing number of positive cases among the inner circle of President Trump, who is continuing his recovery from Covid-19 at the White House. Both Pence and Harris have tested negative for coronavirus in recent days. At their debate, guests will be required to wear masks at all times and undergo coronavirus checks upon entry to the venue. The BBC will be running a live page of tonight's debate, so check back in with the website a few hours from now if you want live coverage of all the twists and turns.

"Pubs, restaurants and visitor attractions are concerned about the possible impact of new restrictions on their businesses The Scottish government is expected to announce stricter restrictions on licensed premises as part of efforts to slow a surge in coronavirus cases. It is thought that the new rules may be focused on pubs and restaurants in areas with higher levels of the virus. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has already said the new measures will not be a return to full lockdown. The virus has been spreading particularly quickly in the central belt of Scotland. It is expected that the new rules will be primarily focused on ""hotspot"" areas, such as the Greater Glasgow and Clyde, Lanarkshire, Lothian, Forth Valley and Ayrshire and Arran health board areas. The Scottish Sun newspaper has said that a series of documents apparently giving details of the new rules for the hospitality sector have beenleaked to its journalists,external. Check the Covid restrictions where you are How many cases are there in your area? Live updates on Nicola Sturgeon's speech Ms Sturgeon will confirm the new measures in a speech to the Scottish Parliament at about 14:50 BST. The licensed trade has called on the Scottish government to provide financial support for any businesses that are affected. The first minister said in June that she believed Scotland was""not far away""from eliminating the virus. But the number of people testing positive has increased sharply in recent weeks - in keeping with some other parts of the UK and Europe - despite Scotland generally taking a more cautious approach to the virus than England. Figures released on Wednesday showed that Scotland recorded more than 1,000 new confirmed cases of the virus in a single day for the first time - although the country is doing far more testing now than at the height of the pandemic earlier in the year. About 730 new cases are being recorded every day in Scotland on average - compared with 285 a fortnight ago - with the number of people dying or being admitted to hospital also increasing. Across the UK, a further14,542 cases were confirmed on Tuesday,external- a figure that has trebled in a fortnight. Last month, people in Scotland were banned from visiting other homes, with strict limits also in force for outdoor meetings and a 22:00 curfew imposed for pubs and restaurants. Ms Sturgeon said on Tuesday that the rising number of cases meant ""additional targeted steps"" were now needed if the country was to attempt to bring the virus back under control before winter. When the 10pm pub curfew was announced a fortnight ago, Nicola Sturgeon made clear she would like to go further in restricting hospitality. The reason she gave for not doing so was the limited capacity of the Scottish government to financially support affected businesses. Talks with the UK government have not resolved that issue yet, but the Scottish government is sufficiently alarmed by rising case numbers that it has decided to act anyway. The trading hours and licensing conditions for pubs and restaurants are likely to be restricted further and these restrictions may be heaviest in the central belt of Scotland, where the prevalence of the virus is strongest. The details were being debated and decided at a special meeting of the Scottish cabinet this morning. Affected businesses are likely to be offered some additional financial help from the Scottish government, while it continues to press for further Treasury support. Today's Scotland-only measures may not amount to the ""short, sharp, shock"" of the much discussed ""circuit-breaker"" - but they may not be the last restrictions to be imposed this autumn either. Tourism and hospitality industry leaders have warned that many businesses will never recover from the impact of any further restrictions. But the first minister has said the new measures would seek to strike a balance between protecting health and the economy. She has already ruled out a nationwide travel ban or the possibility of people being told to stay at home, and has pledged that schools will only close for the duration of the October holidays. It seems likely the new restrictions will primarily be targeted at ""hotspot"" areas with high levels of the virus, potentially alongside some new but possibly less stringent national measures. This video can not be played The first minister said on Monday the new measures would not amount to the lockdown seen in March The rising number of cases in some cities was partly driven by a series of major outbreaks on university campuses - although the virus is increasingly being transmitted to older people too. Many more rural areas have seen far fewer cases - and have questioned the need for any new rules to apply to them. Paul Waterson, of the Scottish Licensed Trade Association, said the prospect of tighter restrictions following the 22:00 closure time for pubs and restaurants was already affecting the industry ""very badly"". He told BBC Breakfast that Scotland could lose about a third of its pubs and about 25% of staff - or 12,500 people. What might the new measures look like? Tourism and hospitality sectors fear new restrictions What new rules have been introduced in other countries? But he predicted that new restrictions could see these figure increase to two-thirds of premises and half of staff. ""To have more restrictions would really be a disaster, not only for pubs and bars but for the whole hospitality industry,"" he said. The Federation of Small Businesses said days of uncertainty about what new measures would be imposed had been ""unhelpful"" and had caused more emotional strain for employers and staff. It called on the Scottish government to outline what new support it would be offering to firms impacted by the restrictions, and warned not doing so would further erode the trust of the business community. The Scottish Conservatives have also called on the Scottish government to offer more than ""empty words"" to businesses, and said it was time for it to ""stop passing the buck back to the UK government"".

To date 127 cases have been linked to an outbreak at theRoyal Glamorgan Hospital in Llantrisant, Rhondda Cynon Taf. Two people have also died amid outbreaks at Prince Charles Hospital, and the Princess of Wales Hospital. Cwm Taf Morgannwg Health Board said ""immediate measures"" had been taken to stop the virus spreading. Medical Director Dr Nick Lyons said there was no evidence of Covid transmission between the three hospitals, and the rise in cases was ""inevitable"". As of Tuesday, 17 cases had been linked to an outbreak at Prince Charles Hospital, in Merthyr Tydfil, and one person had died. Figures also show 15 cases have been linked to Princess of Wales Hospital, Bridgend, and one person has died. Visiting has been suspended at Prince Charles Hospital in Merthyr Tydfil, among others Visits to the hospitals were suspended in September,following concerns in a rise in coronavirus cases in communities.

Merthyr Tydfil now has the highest case rate of coronavirus in Wales, with 200.6 cases per 100,000 of the population over the last seven days. Dr Lyons said all of the confirmed cases linked to the outbreak had tested positive for Covid-19 within 14 days of attending one of the hospitals, but some patients may have caught it elsewhere.""If we look at other outbreaks in other parts of the country, it was inevitable,"" he said. ""It's too early to say we've reached the top of the curve. It's too early to draw conclusions, and the focus needs to be on making the hospital safe."" He added: ""The safety of our patients and staff remains our first priority and immediate measures to contain the spread of the virus have been put in place. ""We are taking the outbreaks extremely seriously and the stringent and robust mitigating actions which have been taken across our sites are being closely observed. ""However given the nature of Coronavirus, there is an inevitable time delay when we will see the positive impact of these measures.Â "" The Princess of Wales Hospital in Bridgend has also seen an outbreak of Covid All routine surgery had already been cancelled at Royal Glamorgan, with patients attending the A&E sent elsewhere, while a field hospital is being used for patients to rehabilitate before being sent home.

"Leader Nikos Michaloliakos and six party colleagues were convicted of running a criminal group (file pic) After a trial lasting more than five years, the leadership of Greece's neo-Nazi party has been convicted of running a criminal organisation. Big crowds gathered outside the court in Athens as the judges gave verdicts on 68 defendants. Golden Dawn secured 18 MPs in 2012, as Greeks were battered by a financial crisis. The criminal inquiry into the party began with the murder of an anti-fascist musician in 2013. Leader Nikos Michaloliakos and six colleagues were convicted of heading a criminal group. Supporter Giorgos Roupakias was found guilty of murdering an anti-racist musician and 15 others were convicted of conspiracy in the case. Some 2,000 police were deployed around Athens Appeals Court as thousands of protesters demanded long jail terms, carrying banners that read ""fear will not win"" and ""Nazis in prison"", Greek media reported. Tear gas was fired into the crowd as some of the protesters clashed with police and threw petrol bombs. Thousands of people crowded outside the court building in the centre of Athens Eleven of the defendants were in the court when the verdict was read out, along with 50 attorneys and 50 journalists. Greek President Katerina Sakellaropoulou said the verdict was an important day for democracy and proof that Greek institutions were able to ""fend off any attempt to undermine them"". Hundreds of witnesses gave evidence in the trial, which was delayed this year by the Covid-19 pandemic. This video can not be played Petrol bombs were met by water cannons as anti-Golden Dawn protesters clashed with police on the day of the verdict At the centre of the trial are Golden Dawn leader Nikos Michaloliakos and 18 ex-MPs who were elected in 2012 when the neo-Nazi party came third in national elections on an anti-immigrant, nationalist platform. Golden Dawn no longer has any MPs in parliament. After they won almost 7% of the vote in May 2012, emboldened supporters attacked political opponents and migrants. Golden Dawn supporter Giorgos Roupakias had already confessed to the murder of rapper Pavlos Fyssas. The musician was chased down by thugs and stabbed in Piraeus in September 2013. As the verdict was delivered, Fyssas's mother Magda cried out, ""My Pavlos defeated them alone!"". The key verdict on Wednesday was that Golden Dawn - Chrysi Avgi in Greek - was a criminal group. Its leadership was found guilty of running it. They included Michaloliakos and six former MPs - Ilias Kasidiaris, Ioannis Lagos, Christos Pappas, Artemis Matthaiopoulos, Ilias Panagiotaros and Giorgos Germenis. The other ex-MPs were found guilty of joining a criminal organisation. Magda Fyssa, the mother of murdered anti-fascist musician Pavlos Fyssas, reacted to the verdicts in courts The three judges, led by Maria Lepeniotou, were due to deliver sentencing later. As well as the fatal stabbing of Pavlos Fyssas, defendants in the trial were also convicted of other violent attacks on migrants and left-wing political opponents. Pavlos Fyssas died after he was set upon by thugs outside a cafe in Piraeus Five Golden Dawn members were convicted of the attempted murders of Egyptian fishermen and four of the attempted murder of communist activists in the PAME union. By Dimitris Psarras, investigative journalist who has tracked Golden Dawn's rise As the Golden Dawn leaders were convicted, very few inside the room applauded but outside thousands began to celebrate. I felt very satisfied, of course. Because I knew the facts revealed during those five and a half years, and I was always optimistic. From 2010, Golden Dawn had managed to poison the Greek political system and democratic institutions, securing contacts with the army, the police, the judiciary and the Church. It is an excellent verdict. Nikos Michaloliakos founded the movement in the mid-1980s and was admirer of Nazism and a Holocaust denier, giving the Hitler salute at party rallies. But he had always denied any knowledge of the Pavlos Fyssas murder. When police raided his home in 2013, they found weapons and ammunition. Golden Dawn officially denied being a neo-Nazi movement, but its badge closely resembled a swastika, some senior members praised Adolf Hitler, and the clothing of choice at anti-immigrant protests was black T-shirts and combat trousers. Witnesses told the trial that members were trained to handle weapons and used Nazi symbols. Greece's Golden Dawn: 'Don't say a word or I'll burn you alive' Jail fails to deter Greek far right Greek bailout crisis in 300 words Last December, chief prosecutor Adamantia Economou prompted uproar, with a call for the party officials to be cleared, arguing there was no evidence they had any part in planning or carrying out the series of attacks. This video can not be played Mourners laid tributes after Pavlos Fyssas's death, as Mark Lowen reports There has been disgust at Golden Dawn across the political spectrum in Greece. Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis said he would not normally comment on court decisions but said the Greek republic had first expelled Golden Dawn from parliament and now Greece's independent judiciary had acted too. ""Democracy won today. It is up to us that it wins every day,"" he said. The verdict was praised as ""just"" and ""historic"" by Prokopis Pavlopoulos, who was president of Greece until earlier this year. Centre-left political leader Fofi Gennimata said the decision sent a strong message to Europe that ""fascism has no place in our lives"". Nils Muiznieks of Amnesty International also said the trial sent a clear message: that ""violent and racist criminal activity - whether perpetrated by individuals on the street or members of parliament - will not go unpunished"". Meanwhile, the Jewish cemetery in Athens was daubed this week with anti-Semitic graffiti and Nazi slogans, prompting condemnation from Greek ministers and the Jewish community.

"Sarah Forbes Bonetta, Queen Victoria's African goddaughter by artist Hannah Uzor, is on display at Osborne House A new painting of Queen Victoria's African goddaughter has gone on display as English Heritage said it would feature portraits of ""overlooked"" black figures connected with its sites. Sarah Forbes Bonetta was sold into slavery aged five and presented as a ""diplomatic gift"" to Captain Frederick Forbes in 1850 and brought to England. She then met Queen Victoria through the captain, who paid for her education. The painting is on show at the Isle of Wight's Osborne House. The picture is on display at the royal seaside palace, where the Queen once lived with Prince Albert and their nine children, to coincide with Black History Month. English Heritage is displaying a portrait of Bonetta as part of a plan to feature works of ""overlooked"" black figures connected with its sites The portrait, by artist Hannah Uzor, is based on a photograph and shows Ms Bonetta wearing her wedding dress. Ms Uzor said: ""To see Sarah return to Osborne - her godmother's home - is very satisfying and I hope my portrait will mean more people discover her story."" Breathing life into black British history Ms Bonetta named her first daughter after the Queen, who also became the child's godmother. Captain Forbes named her Sarah Forbes Bonetta, partly after his ship, the HMS Bonetta. He had visited the King of Dahomey - in what is now Benin - as a representative of Queen Victoria, on a mission to negotiate the suppression of slavery. Curatorial director of English Heritage Anna Eavis said: ""It's an extraordinary story. ""Britain had abolished the slave trade and was now on a mission to make sure the slave trade was abolished throughout the world. Captain Frederick Forbes, a naval captain, arrived at Dahomey to try and talk the King of Dahomey out of continuing with this trade. ""He wasn't successful but the king presented him with this little girl who was seven years old and an orphan.  Forbes took her back and presented her to Queen Victoria at Windsor Castle. ""Victoria was so affected by this little girl arriving she wrote about it in her diary and took her under her wing, paid for her education and took an interest in her and her daughter for the rest of their lives."" Ms Bonetta died in Madeira, aged 37, after becoming sick with tuberculosis. Her daughter Victoria received the news while visiting the Queen at Osborne. Artist Hannah Uzor with her painting of Sarah Forbes Bonetta English Heritage said from spring 2021 further portraits of black figures associated with its sites, whose stories like Ms Bonetta's which had been ""previously overlooked"", will go on display. The charity said: ""Black history is part of English history and, while we know we have more to do, English Heritage is committed to telling the story of England in full."" Ms Eavis added: ""There are a number of black figures from the past who have played significant roles at some of the historic sites in our care but their stories are not very well known. ""Starting with Sarah, our portraits project is one way we're bringing these stories to life and sharing them with our visitors."" Ms Bonetta's story was thesubject of a play released at the start of the year called The Gift. Other portraits set to go on display include Rome's African-born emperor Septimius Severus, who strengthened Hadrian's Wall, and James Chappell, a 17th Century servant at Kirby Hall in Northamptonshire, who saved the life of the country house's owner. The portrait being carried through the grounds of Osborne House Properties where visitors will find new information about connections to the slave trade will include Brodsworth Hall in South Yorkshire. Its former owner, Peter Thellusson, was not a slave trader himself but invested in slavery-related commodities and land. At Kenwood House, in London, visitors will learn about how rulings by former owner Lord Mansfield, as Lord Chief Justice, made a significant contribution along the road to abolition.

"Doctors are being told to ""think carefully"" before ordering any tests for their patients, amid shortages caused by a supply chain failure at a major diagnostics company. Swiss pharmaceutical firm Roche said problems with a move to a new warehouse had led to a ""very significant"" drop in its processing capacity. A spokesman said Covid-19 tests would be prioritised. But the backlog could affect tests including for cancer and heart disease. One NHS trust in the south west has already advised its GPs to stop all non-urgent blood tests. A memo seen by the BBC, sent to clinicians within a large hospital trust in London, said leaders were ""preparing for a sustained disruption"". ""We urgently need all clinical teams to only send tests that are absolutely essential for immediate patient care, delaying testing where possible,"" it said. Thyroid and cortisol tests were unavailable, while certain cholesterol, liver function and inflammation tests were ""severely restricted"". In a statement, Roche said: ""We deeply regret that there has been a delay in the dispatch of some products. ""We are prioritising the dispatch of Covid-19 PCR [diagnostic] and antibody tests and doing everything we can to ensure there is no impact on the supply of these to the NHS."" How to get a Covid test It did not comment on the impact on other specific tests including for kidney, liver and thyroid function, sepsis and infection. Dr Tom Lewis, lead clinician for pathology at North Devon District Hospital, said his hospital's trust had sent out communications that all non-urgent blood tests in the community should be stopped. Without rationing these non-urgent tests, he said, they would run out of swabs in ""three to four days"". Even with rationing, essential equipment could run short by next week, he said. A scientist at a major London hospital's lab said they had already stopped doing thyroid tests, and expected an important test of liver function, and another for inflammation, to run out within the day. Many of the London labs are supplied by Roche, he said, with reagents - substances used to analyse test results -  proving a particular problem. Allan Wilson, president of the Institute of Biomedical Science, said if the problem continued for days ""it probably will have minimal impact, but if it's weeks then yes it could have a considerable impact on our ability to deliver tests,"" across a whole range of conditions in the UK. The main issue appears to be with the supply of reagents - used to detect the presence of a substance whether that's pregnancy hormones, blood glucose or coronavirus. Because these have such wide application, the number of different diagnostic tests that could be affected is vast. If you go to your GP with a hormonal imbalance, chest infection or sexually-transmitted infection (STI), your test will end up being processed in the lab using these materials. If you're admitted to hospital, you will have your electrolytes tested again relying on the same kind of materials. And your organ function may also be monitored in the same way. Kit supplied by Roche is crucial in testing the health of your liver, heart and kidneys. They also supply antibodies which are used in cancer diagnosis. For NHS trusts which use the company as their main supplier of these types of diagnostic equipment, the work of whole departments could be at risk. Roche initially told trusts it could take more than a fortnight to resolve the problem. But a spokesperson later said they were confident there would be ""significant improvements by the weekend"" and that they would be ""well on the way to resolution by the end of next week"". The company is one of the main suppliers of diagnostic testing equipment and materials in the UK. The affected warehouse in West Sussex is Roche's only distribution centre in the UK and covers the whole country. In September it moved from another warehouse in East Sussex as part of its Brexit preparations, the BBC understands. It is ""not a problem with the volume of product available"" but a logistical issue affecting their ability to distribute it, a spokesperson said. Dr Lewis said perhaps most concerning was the shortage of electrolyte tests supplied by Roche, since these were ""the key test"" for critically ill patients, as well as being extremely commonly used by GPs to check people's medications were safe. One virologist in the Midlands tweeted that her service had not received Hepatitis C testing kits, and was now running short. Materials used in cancer diagnostics could also be affected. In a letter sent to NHS trusts, seen by the BBC, Roche said: ""In September we moved from our old warehouse to a new automated warehouse capable of much higher volumes. ""However, during the transition we encountered some unforeseen issues and a very significant drop in our processing capacity. Since then we have worked around the clock to prioritise and manage orders as well as increase this capacity"". The letter went on to advise local NHS services to ""activate [their] local contingency plans"" and ""look to prioritise essential services only"". But one clinician pointed out that local contingency plans often involve sending tests to a nearby lab, which in this case might also be affected. An NHS spokesperson said:""Roche has alerted hospitals to an issue with their supply chain, and they will be working urgently to resolve this issue.""

We'll be back again next week for the 'next episode' of prime minister's questions. We hope you'll come back and join us then. Leila NathooBBC political correspondent Boris Johnson insisted that data on
coronavirus hotspots in England, where case numbers are high and hospital
admissions are concentrated, showed that the government's local and regional
approach was the right one. But Sir Keir Starmer said
it was 'obvious' that something had gone wrong' - as infection rates were still
rising in most of the areas under enhanced restrictions. Sir Keir echoed the
frustrations of some Tory backbenchers by calling for the government to publish
the scientific evidence behind the 10pm curfew. But the Prime Minister accused
his opponent of flip flopping on his support for the measures - pointing out
that Sir Keir said he backed the rule of six, but his party abstained on it in
a Commons vote last night. Reality Check During PMQs, Keir Starmer
criticised the way local restrictions are being managed. âTwenty local areas have been
under restrictions for two months, in 19 of those 20 areas infections rates
have gone up,â he said. The Labour partycompiled a list,externalof local authorities, and it looks like  the increases are correct. But their list also includes areas
which havenât actually faced local restrictions for two complete months. For example, Oadby and Wigston did
face additional restrictions at the end of June, but these were lifted after a
month. They were only placed under restrictions again on 22 September. On another point, Sir Keir said areas in parts of the north of England had been placed into local
restrictions at rates lower than those
experienced in parts of the south which are not under any
kind of lockdown. This is true. Bury, Tameside,
Stockport and Wigan (to name a few) had case rates of between 20 and 30 per
100,000 people when they first went into lockdown. The London borough of
Hillingdon â the prime ministerâs constituency â had rates of 46 cases per
100,000, while Redbridge had 57 and Barking and Dagenham 53, in the week ending
the 27 September, according to Public Health England. And analysis by the BBC
data team suggests that these rates have increased in the past week. Our political correspondent tweets... Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

You can see the prime minister's frustration, because initially Labour backed the move. By pushing the government to produce the evidence - which they haven't thus far - you wonder whether Labour might be paving the way to gang up with Tory rebels ahead of a vote on it next week. Reality Check Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer
asked the prime minister to publish the scientific evidence for closing
pubs and restaurants at 10pm before MPs vote on it next week. Boris
Johnson responded during prime mister's questions: âThe basis on which we set
out the curtailment of hospitality was the basis on which he accepted it two
weeks ago and that is to reduce the spread of the virus.â The government

Labour's Taiwo Owatemi says her constituents are worried that the government is ""relying on dodgy figures"" to build ""unaffordable"" homes on green spaces. She says her constituency of Coventry is ""running out of brownfield sites"" and asks the prime minister where new homes will be built. ""There is an abundant of brownfield spaces across the whole of the UK,"" replies the prime minister. He says home ownership is hampered by ""cumbersome planning procedures"" and the ""inability of young people being able to afford homes"". He tells MPs the government is introducing mortgages for 95% of the value of a property in order to solve the problem. Conservative Dame Cheryl Gillan asks about whether the Chilterns will be made a National Park, following recommendations in a government report.

Leila NathooBBC political correspondent The Labour leader Keir Starmer continues with his strategy
of challenging the government on competence in dealing with coronavirus - this
time pressing on the missing positive test results in England. Boris Johnson has previously labelled him 'captain
hindsight' - today Sir Keir turned the attack around, accusing the prime minister of
'government in hindsight'. For his final question, Sir Keir says the government's inability to explain when areas will enter into or come out of restrictions is ""getting ridiculous"". He says there is a need to clarify the ""scientific basis"" behind the 10pm pub curfew, and asks for this to be published before MPs vote on whether to keep it in place next week. In reply, Boris Johnson says Labour accepted the rationale for the new closing time for pubs ""only two weeks ago"" when it backed the idea. Referencing Sir Keir's new slogan at Labour's autumn conference, he says the leader of the opposition is offering ""not new leadership"", but ""no leadership"". It gets a bit testy when Sir Keir Starmer snaps at the PM: ""If you actually listen to the question we might get on better."" He then asks Boris Johnson why his own constituency in Hillingdon has not had restrictions imposed, despite having higher infection rates than other places that have seen lockdown measures introduced. Boris Johnson says he has already explained why ""we are introducing differentiated restrictions."" ""I wish I could pretend eveything was going to be rosy,"" he says and calls for ""a concerted national effort"" to tackle the virus. ""I think it quite extraordinary that the Labour leader supports the rule of six while encouraging his entire party to abstain,"" he adds in a dig at Sir Keir Starmer. Â© 2025 BBC.

"The BBC revealed how criminal gangs had set up fake companies to claim loans. Up to 60% of emergency pandemic loans made under the Bounce Back scheme may never be repaid, a report by the government's spending watchdog says. The National Audit Office (NAO) said taxpayers could lose as much as Â£26bn, from fraud, organised crime or default. The lending scheme carried lighter checks than others and was aimed at small businesses unable to access other pandemic funding support. A recent BBC investigation revealedhow fraudsters were using the loan system. Many of those affected will have no idea their names have been used until repayment letters begin arriving in early summer. One of the victims spoken to by the BBC, Mark Telling, said he was worried ""to death"" to discover a company set up in his name by a criminal had ""borrowed"" Â£50,000 from the bail-out scheme. The BBC also spoke to Sue Burden, who had also found her identity had been stolen to set up a bogus company to access the scheme. She said she had gone ""from tears to anger... now I'm going to be scared to do anything"". The BBC reported last weekthat the government was warned back in Maythat the scheme was at ""very high risk of fraud"" from ""organised crime"". The government said it has tried to minimise fraud through lenders' background checks. The scheme provides firms with 100% government-backed finance worth up to Â£50,000. Demand has been greater than anticipated, and the total value of these loans is now expected to be Â£38bn-Â£48bn, up from an estimate of Â£18bn-Â£26bn. They do not have to be paid off for 10 years and offer a range of flexible payment options. The  loan scheme is an extension of earlier offers which some businesses complained they could not access as the lending criteria was too strict. The NAO report warned that the speed with which the scheme was rolled out heightened the fraud risk. It took a month to ensure businesses could not receive more than one loan. 'My name was used to steal a government Covid loan' Arrest over Â£110k Covid small business loan fraud UK banks get 100,000 loan applications on first day The Public Accounts Committee said it was the government's largest and most risky business support scheme. It says it will not assess the value-for-money of the scheme, as the loans will not start being paid back until May next year. The NAO analysis said losses from the scheme are likely to reach ""significantly above"" normal estimates for public-sector fraud of 0.5% to 5%. The report also said the UK's five biggest banks will make nearly Â£1bn between them from the scheme. Meg Hillier, chair of the Public Accounts Committee, said the loans had been a vital lifeline for many businesses. But she added that ""the government estimates that up to 60% of the loans could turn bad - this would be a truly eye-watering loss of public money"". ""The bounce back loan scheme got money into the hands of small businesses quickly, and will have stopped some from going under. ""But the scheme's hasty launch means criminals may have helped themselves to billions of pounds at the taxpayer's expense. ""Sadly, many firms won't be able to repay their loans and the banks will be quick to wash their hands of the problem. Today's report confirms what many people had suspected. In May, the government had to get money to small businesses as quickly as possible, before tens of thousands of them went bust. But to do that, they had to make compromises on credit and fraud checks.  This opened the doors to a whole range of problems - including fraud by organised criminal gangs. We've found evidence of more than 100 bogus firms set up by scammers to make fraudulent applications - getting the maximum Â£50,000 each time. They've used the stolen, personal details of innocent victims to set up the fake companies - victims who won't know anything about it until the letters demanding repayment start arriving through their doors next summer. How it's done: Gangs steal victims' personal details using phishing emails or buying them on criminal forums. They then set up a bogus business in their name. After opening a business bank account they then apply for a Bounce Back Loan through the same bank. The taxpayer is in the same position - waiting to find out how much the scheme will ultimately cost us.  The warning from the National Audit Office is clear - it has the potential to be ""very high"". Sue and Dave Burden, from the south of England, were shocked to find that Sue's identity had been stolen to set up a company and claim a bounce back loan. ""I've gone from tears to anger,"" she told the BBC. ""Now I'm going to be scared to do anything."" The state-owned British Business Bank (BBB), which supervises the bounce back loan scheme, twice raised concerns, firstly in May. The BBB expects it will pay out Â£1.07bn in interest payments to the high street lenders that provided the cash. Most of this will go to UK's five biggest banks, Barclays, HSBC, Lloyds, NatWest and Santander, which provided Â£31.3bn of funding. According to latest Treasury figures,external, there have been 1.55 million applications for the loans, with 1.26 million approvals. ""We targeted this support to help those who need it most as quickly as possible and we won't apologise for this,"" a government spokesperson said. ""We've looked to minimise fraud - with lenders implementing a range of protections including anti-money laundering and customer checks, as well as transaction monitoring controls. ""Any fraudulent applications can be criminally prosecuted for which penalties include imprisonment or a fine or both."" Have you been affected by the issues raised in this story?

Leila NathooBBC political correspondent The Labour leader Keir Starmer continues with his strategy
of challenging the government on competence in dealing with coronavirus - this
time pressing on the missing positive test results in England. Boris Johnson has previously labelled him 'captain
hindsight' - today Sir Keir turned the attack around, accusing the prime minister of
'government in hindsight'. For his final question, Sir Keir says the government's inability to explain when areas will enter into or come out of restrictions is ""getting ridiculous"". He says there is a need to clarify the ""scientific basis"" behind the 10pm pub curfew, and asks for this to be published before MPs vote on whether to keep it in place next week. In reply, Boris Johnson says Labour accepted the rationale for the new closing time for pubs ""only two weeks ago"" when it backed the idea. Referencing Sir Keir's new slogan at Labour's autumn conference, he says the leader of the opposition is offering ""not new leadership"", but ""no leadership"". It gets a bit testy when Sir Keir Starmer snaps at the PM: ""If you actually listen to the question we might get on better."" He then asks Boris Johnson why his own constituency in Hillingdon has not had restrictions imposed, despite having higher infection rates than other places that have seen lockdown measures introduced. Boris Johnson says he has already explained why ""we are introducing differentiated restrictions."" ""I wish I could pretend eveything was going to be rosy,"" he says and calls for ""a concerted national effort"" to tackle the virus. ""I think it quite extraordinary that the Labour leader supports the rule of six while encouraging his entire party to abstain,"" he adds in a dig at Sir Keir Starmer. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Emmanuelle Charpentier (L) and Jennifer Doudna began a formidable partnership in 2011 Two scientists have been awarded the 2020 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for developing the tools to edit DNA. Emmanuelle Charpentier and Jennifer Doudna are the first two women to share the prize, which honours their work on the technology of genome editing. Their discovery, known as Crispr-Cas9 ""genetic scissors"", is a way of making specific and precise changes to the DNA contained in living cells. They will split the prize money of 10 million krona (Â£861,200; $1,110,400). Biological chemist Pernilla Wittung-Stafshede, commented: ""The ability to cut DNA where you want has revolutionised the life sciences."" Listen to the BBC's The Life Scientific: Jennifer Doudna Not only has the women's technology been transformative for basic research, it could also be used to treat inherited illnesses. Prof Charpentier, from the Max Planck Unit for the Science of Pathogens in Berlin, said it was an emotional moment when she learned about the award. ""When it happens, you're very surprised, and you think it's not real. But obviously it's real,"" she said. Hepatitis C discovery wins the Nobel Prize Black hole breakthroughs win Nobel physics prize On being one of the first two women to share the prize, Prof Charpentier said: ""I wish that this will provide a positive message specifically for young girls who would like to follow the path of science... and to show them that women in science can also have an impact with the research they are performing."" She continued: ""This is not just for women, but we see a clear lack of interest in following a scientific path, which is very worrying."" Artwork: The pair developed tools that allow the code of life to be rewritten During Prof Charpentier's studies of the bacteriumStreptococcus pyogenes, she discovered a previously unknown molecule called tracrRNA. Her work showed that tracrRNA is part of the organism's system of immune defence. This system, known as Crispr-Cas, disarms viruses by cleaving their DNA - like genetic scissors. In 2011, the same year she published this work, Prof Charpentier began a collaboration with Prof Doudna, from the University of California, Berkeley. The two had been introduced by a colleague of Doudna's at a cafe in Puerto Rico, where the scientists were attending a conference. And it was on the following day, during a walk through the streets of the island's capital, San Juan, that Prof Charpentier proposed the idea of joining forces. This video can not be played Fergus Walsh explains how gene editing works Together, they recreated the bacterium's genetic scissors in a test tube. They also simplified the scissors' molecular components so they were easier to use. In their natural form, the bacterial scissors recognise DNA from viruses. But Charpentier and Doudna showed that they could be reprogrammed to cut any DNA molecule at a predetermined site, publishing their findings in a landmark 2012 paper. The breakthrough DNA snipping technology allowed the ""code of life"" to be rewritten. UK approves embryo 'gene editing' First gene-editing in human body attempt Charpentier and Doudna are the first two women to share the chemistry prize Since the two scientists discovered the Crispr-Cas9 genetic scissors, their use has exploded. The tool has contributed to many important discoveries in basic research; and, in medicine, clinical trials of new cancer therapies are underway. The technology also holds the promise of being able to treat or even cure inherited diseases. It is currently being investigated for its potential to treat sickle cell anaemia, a blood disorder that affects millions of people worldwide. But without regulation, some fear Crispr could equally be used to create ""designer babies"", opening up an ethical minefield. If genome-edited children grow up and have children, any alterations to their genomes could be passed down through the generations - introducing lasting changes to the human population. Last year, Chinese scientistHe Jiankui was jailed for three yearsafter creating the world's first gene-edited human babies. He was convicted of violating a government ban by carrying out his own experiments on human embryos, to try to give them protection against HIV. This video can not be played Prof Emmanuelle Charpentier on the benefits offered by the CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing system It had been thought a Nobel for this revolutionary science would not be awarded for many years because the technique is also the subject of a long-running patent battle in the US. The dispute involves Charpentier and Doudna's group at the University of California, Berkeley, and a team at MIT and Harvard's Broad Institute in Cambridge, Massachusetts. The disagreement centres on the use of the Crispr technique in eukaryotic cells - those cells that bundle their DNA in a nucleus. It is in such cells, which are found in higher animals, that the most profitable future applications will exist. The competing institutions claim their scientists made the crucial, most relevant advances. Emmanuelle Charpentier was born in 1968 in Juvisy-sur-Orge, France. She obtained her PhD while at the Institut Pasteur in Paris and subsequently worked at scientific institutes in the US, Austria, Sweden and Germany - in addition to her native France. Jennifer Doudna was born in 1964 in Washington DC but spent much of her childhood in Hilo, Hawaii. She was awarded her PhD by Harvard Medical School. This year is the first time any of the science prizes has been awarded to two women without a male collaborator also listed on the award. Swedish industrialist and chemist Alfred Nobel founded the prizes in his will, written in 1895 - a year before his death.

"Boris Johnson defended the government's response to local lockdowns and virus infections on university campuses Sir Keir Starmer pressed the PM to publish the science behind the decision to enforce a 10pm curfew on pubs and restaurants In Scotland, Nicola Sturgeon is expected to announce further restrictions aimed a slowing coronavirus infections UK's Chief Brexit negotiator Lord Frost and cabinet minister Michael Gove will appear in front of a select committee later MPs will hold a retrospective vote later to approve lockdown restrictions which were introduced in some parts of England last week Unite General Secretary Len McCluskey has told the BBC the union will cut its funding to the Labour party by 10% Council leaders have warned the government that plans to relax planning rules could lead to fewer new affordable homes being built Kate Whannel and Paul Seddon BBC Politics Thanks for following along with us today. We'll be back again next week for the 'next episode' of prime minister's questions. We hope you'll come back and join us then. Leila NathooBBC political correspondent Boris Johnson insisted that data on
coronavirus hotspots in England, where case numbers are high and hospital
admissions are concentrated, showed that the government's local and regional
approach was the right one. But Sir Keir Starmer said
it was 'obvious' that something had gone wrong' - as infection rates were still
rising in most of the areas under enhanced restrictions. Sir Keir echoed the
frustrations of some Tory backbenchers by calling for the government to publish
the scientific evidence behind the 10pm curfew. But the Prime Minister accused
his opponent of flip flopping on his support for the measures - pointing out
that Sir Keir said he backed the rule of six, but his party abstained on it in
a Commons vote last night. Reality Check During PMQs, Keir Starmer
criticised the way local restrictions are being managed. âTwenty local areas have been
under restrictions for two months, in 19 of those 20 areas infections rates
have gone up,â he said. The Labour partycompiled a list,externalof local authorities, and it looks like  the increases are correct. But their list also includes areas
which havenât actually faced local restrictions for two complete months. For example, Oadby and Wigston did
face additional restrictions at the end of June, but these were lifted after a
month. They were only placed under restrictions again on 22 September. On another point, Sir Keir said areas in parts of the north of England had been placed into local
restrictions at rates lower than those
experienced in parts of the south which are not under any
kind of lockdown. This is true. Bury, Tameside,
Stockport and Wigan (to name a few) had case rates of between 20 and 30 per
100,000 people when they first went into lockdown. The London borough of
Hillingdon â the prime ministerâs constituency â had rates of 46 cases per
100,000, while Redbridge had 57 and Barking and Dagenham 53, in the week ending
the 27 September, according to Public Health England. And analysis by the BBC
data team suggests that these rates have increased in the past week. Our political correspondent tweets... Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Laura KuenssbergPolitical editor Labour believe they are onto something with this agenda of pressing the government over how competently it has responded to the Covid pandemic. By pushing the prime minister to give more information on the scientific justification for the 10pm pub closing time, Labour are opening up the possibility they might be able to walk back from supporting it. You can see the prime minister's frustration, because initially Labour backed the move. By pushing the government to produce the evidence - which they haven't thus far - you wonder whether Labour might be paving the way to gang up with Tory rebels ahead of a vote on it next week. Reality Check Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer
asked the prime minister to publish the scientific evidence for closing
pubs and restaurants at 10pm before MPs vote on it next week. Boris
Johnson responded during prime mister's questions: âThe basis on which we set
out the curtailment of hospitality was the basis on which he accepted it two
weeks ago and that is to reduce the spread of the virus.â The government
has not yet laid out its specific evidence for 10pm closure. Prof
Mark Woolhousefrom University of Edinburgh, a member of the government's infection modelling team, recently told the BBC's Andrew Marr ""there isn't a proven scientific basis for any of this"". You can read more about the question here.  And that's it - PMQs is over and Boris Johnson has left the Chamber. Labour's Taiwo Owatemi says her constituents are worried that the government is ""relying on dodgy figures"" to build ""unaffordable"" homes on green spaces. She says her constituency of Coventry is ""running out of brownfield sites"" and asks the prime minister where new homes will be built. ""There is an abundant of brownfield spaces across the whole of the UK,"" replies the prime minister. He says home ownership is hampered by ""cumbersome planning procedures"" and the ""inability of young people being able to afford homes"". He tells MPs the government is introducing mortgages for 95% of the value of a property in order to solve the problem. Conservative Dame Cheryl Gillan asks about whether the Chilterns will be made a National Park, following recommendations in a government report. Following thePM's party conference speech yesterday, she also asks what the government is doing to protect the environment ahead of the rescheduled COP26 UN climate summit next year. Boris Johnson says the government will consider ""each recommendation"" in the report, and is committed to protecting areas of natural beauty. He adds that the UK is ""leading the way"" on efforts to protect habitats in the run-up to the summit. Leila NathooBBC political correspondent Keir Starmer echoed the frustrations of
some Tory backbenchers by calling for Boris Johnson to publish the scientific
evidence behind the 10pm curfew. In
a now familiar pattern, the Prime Minister again accused the Labour leader of
flip flopping on his support for the government - saying Sir Keir had backed
the curfew when it was introduced, on the basis that it would curb the spread
of the virus. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter. We ask for your permission before anything is loaded, as they may be using cookies and other technologies.

"This video can not be played Justin Welby: ""We need to focus, and put at the centre of our attention, victims and survivors"" ""Nothing must get in the way"" of changes needed to protect children from sexual abuse in the Church of England, the Archbishop of Canterbury has said. It comes after the Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse said the Church had failed to protect children and had a culture where abusers ""could hide"". Justin Welby said the Church ""must do whatever it takes"" to rectify its failings, saying the IICSA report's findings were a ""big wake-up call"". ""We've got to do better,"" he said. ""And I want to show that I can do better."" The IICSA report,externalsaid 390 clergy and other Church leaders were convicted of abuse between the 1940s and 2018. The Church of England defended alleged perpetrators instead of protecting children and young people from sexual predators, the report said. It also found examples of clergy being ordained despite having a history of child sexual offences. The report conceded there had been ""a number of important improvements"" in child protection practices in the Church of England in recent years, but the inquiry's chairwoman, Prof Alexis Jay, added it was ""vital"" that it improved how it responded to allegations of child sexual abuse. Church of England 'allowed child abusers to hide' How the child sexual abuse inquiry works Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Mr Welby said the findings of the IICSA report were ""deeply shameful"" and ""disgraceful"". ""I think the whole system has been broken, the way we deal with this, and it needs to move towards, as the report suggests, a much more independent oversight of safeguarding,"" he said. ""(One) in which there is responsibility clearly assigned and it is not in the hands of those who are, in a phrase that was used in the inquiry, seeking to mark their own homework."" He said he believed the Church had been ""very bad at supporting those who are most deeply affected by the allegations of abuse"", saying: ""The whole lack of care in this is shocking."" ""We need to focus and put at the centre of our attention now victims and survivors,"" he said. ""We need a redress system in place very soon - we've begun a pilot scheme already and nothing must get in the way, we must do whatever it takes to get that in place now and this report is a big wake-up call."" He added: ""We've got to do better and I want to show that I can do better."" In 2018 there were 2,504 safeguarding concerns reported to dioceses in England about either children or vulnerable adults. The IICSA's report is based on the inquiry's public hearings held in July 2019 which investigated safeguarding issues in the Church of England and the Church in Wales - each of which sit within the worldwide Anglican Communion. Gilo, who was abused by a clergyman when he was young, says survivors are still angry with the Church After the publication of the report on Tuesday, one victim of abuse, who says he was raped by a clergyman in London more than 40 years ago, told the BBC it would take ""courage"" from the Church and its leaders to ""salvage itself and redeem itself"". Gilo - who asked us not to use his surname - previously told the BBC he had made more than 20 attempts to contact senior members of the Church after his decision to report the assaults, but often received no reply. The Church eventually agreed it was at fault and reached a financial settlement with him. On Tuesday, Gilo said many survivors still felt a ""tremendous sense of anger and lack of trust"" in the Church. Gilo, whose abuser has since died, said he believed the Church's recently-appointed lead safeguarding bishop, Dr Jonathan Gibbs, was keen to make a difference - but that ""there needs to be a real turnaround"" in the Church's culture. ""Once survivors see real help, and real support beginning to reach them from a Church that has mouthed support for a long time but not delivered it... there could be a turning point."" The Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse (IICSA) in England and Wales is investigating claims against local authorities, religious organisations, the armed forces and public and private institutions - as well as people in the public eye. Following the death of BBC presenter Jimmy Savile in 2011, hundreds of people came forward to say he had abused them as children. The spotlight has also fallen on sexual assaults carried out in schools, children's homes and at NHS sites. At the same time, there have been claims of past failures by police and prosecutors to properly investigate allegations. The IICSA was established in 2015, with the then-Home Secretary Theresa May saying it would ""expose those failures and learn the lessons"" from the past. In 2018 the inquiry published aninterim report,externalwith 18 recommendations - some of which have been acted upon.

"The BBC revealed how criminal gangs had set up fake companies to claim loans. Up to 60% of emergency pandemic loans made under the Bounce Back scheme may never be repaid, a report by the government's spending watchdog says. The National Audit Office (NAO) said taxpayers could lose as much as Â£26bn, from fraud, organised crime or default. The lending scheme carried lighter checks than others and was aimed at small businesses unable to access other pandemic funding support. A recent BBC investigation revealedhow fraudsters were using the loan system. Many of those affected will have no idea their names have been used until repayment letters begin arriving in early summer. One of the victims spoken to by the BBC, Mark Telling, said he was worried ""to death"" to discover a company set up in his name by a criminal had ""borrowed"" Â£50,000 from the bail-out scheme. The BBC also spoke to Sue Burden, who had also found her identity had been stolen to set up a bogus company to access the scheme. She said she had gone ""from tears to anger... now I'm going to be scared to do anything"". The BBC reported last weekthat the government was warned back in Maythat the scheme was at ""very high risk of fraud"" from ""organised crime"". The government said it has tried to minimise fraud through lenders' background checks. The scheme provides firms with 100% government-backed finance worth up to Â£50,000. Demand has been greater than anticipated, and the total value of these loans is now expected to be Â£38bn-Â£48bn, up from an estimate of Â£18bn-Â£26bn. They do not have to be paid off for 10 years and offer a range of flexible payment options. The  loan scheme is an extension of earlier offers which some businesses complained they could not access as the lending criteria was too strict. The NAO report warned that the speed with which the scheme was rolled out heightened the fraud risk. It took a month to ensure businesses could not receive more than one loan. 'My name was used to steal a government Covid loan' Arrest over Â£110k Covid small business loan fraud UK banks get 100,000 loan applications on first day The Public Accounts Committee said it was the government's largest and most risky business support scheme. It says it will not assess the value-for-money of the scheme, as the loans will not start being paid back until May next year. The NAO analysis said losses from the scheme are likely to reach ""significantly above"" normal estimates for public-sector fraud of 0.5% to 5%. The report also said the UK's five biggest banks will make nearly Â£1bn between them from the scheme. Meg Hillier, chair of the Public Accounts Committee, said the loans had been a vital lifeline for many businesses. But she added that ""the government estimates that up to 60% of the loans could turn bad - this would be a truly eye-watering loss of public money"". ""The bounce back loan scheme got money into the hands of small businesses quickly, and will have stopped some from going under. ""But the scheme's hasty launch means criminals may have helped themselves to billions of pounds at the taxpayer's expense. ""Sadly, many firms won't be able to repay their loans and the banks will be quick to wash their hands of the problem. Today's report confirms what many people had suspected. In May, the government had to get money to small businesses as quickly as possible, before tens of thousands of them went bust. But to do that, they had to make compromises on credit and fraud checks.  This opened the doors to a whole range of problems - including fraud by organised criminal gangs. We've found evidence of more than 100 bogus firms set up by scammers to make fraudulent applications - getting the maximum Â£50,000 each time. They've used the stolen, personal details of innocent victims to set up the fake companies - victims who won't know anything about it until the letters demanding repayment start arriving through their doors next summer. How it's done: Gangs steal victims' personal details using phishing emails or buying them on criminal forums. They then set up a bogus business in their name. After opening a business bank account they then apply for a Bounce Back Loan through the same bank. The taxpayer is in the same position - waiting to find out how much the scheme will ultimately cost us.  The warning from the National Audit Office is clear - it has the potential to be ""very high"". Sue and Dave Burden, from the south of England, were shocked to find that Sue's identity had been stolen to set up a company and claim a bounce back loan. ""I've gone from tears to anger,"" she told the BBC. ""Now I'm going to be scared to do anything.""

"Supermarket giant Tesco has seen first-half profits rise by more than a quarter as customers bought more food during the pandemic and online orders doubled. Pre-tax profit for the 26 weeks to 29 August was Â£551m, 28.7% up on 2019. It isTesco's first set of results under its new chief executive,external, Ken Murphy, who started last week. He replaces Dave Lewis, who had been running the UK's biggest retailer since 2014. With more customers turning to online shopping, Tesco more than doubled delivery capacity to 1.5 million slots a week during the first half, including serving 674,000 vulnerable customers. While demand for food rose, clothing fared less well, with sales down 17.2%. Like many of its rivals, Tesco was forced to overhaul its strategy in-store and online amid the coronavirus lockdown. Mr Murphy told a conference call with journalists the first half of this year had ""tested our business in ways we had never imagined"", but employees had ""risen brilliantly to every challenge"". He said he felt ""very comfortable in my own skin and my ability to lead this business"". ""I'm really happy with the strategy and direction of the company,"" he added. ""My job is to maintain momentum in the business and deliver a fantastic Christmas."" Tesco is in the process of selling its businesses in Thailand, Malaysia and Poland, but Mr Murphy said there was currently ""no plan for further retrenchment"". When Dave Lewis was parachuted into the top job in Tesco in 2014, the business was in crisis. Now Ken Murphy is presiding over his first set of results and Britain's biggest retailer is doing rather well. The business, he says, is in ""great shape"". But his job is going to be far from easy. He's got to steer Tesco through the ongoing Covid-19 crisis during the key festive trading period. Then there's the impact of a potential no-deal Brexit looming on the horizon. And as the job losses start to mount, shoppers' budgets will be coming under increasing pressure. The battle for our wallets is set to become even more intense. Finally, now that Tesco's turnaround is complete, Mr Murphy will have to focus in the longer term on how to grow the business. A new chapter begins. Operating profit figures told a different story, however, falling 15.6% to Â£1.037bn. One of the items dragging down the balance sheet was Tesco Bank, which made a loss of Â£155m. Tesco said sales in the UK and Ireland rose 8.6% to Â£24.3bn, with overall revenue of Â£28.7bn. But it added that coronavirus-related costs had hit Â£533m. UK food sales went up 9.2% during the period, the retailer said. Ocado takes Tesco's most valuable retailer slot Tesco targets 300% rise in vegan meat sales The supermarket said it was increasing its interim dividend by 21% to 3.2p a share. It also named a new chief financial officer, Imran Nawaz, who is joining from Tate & Lyle. He will succeed Alan Stewart, who is retiring in April. ""In spite of these positive results, Tesco will still have concerns afterits valuation dropped below Ocado,"" said Julie Palmer, partner at Begbies Traynor. And even though Dave Lewis had left ""a well-oiled machine"" behind him, it would not be an easy ride for Mr Murphy as the new chief executive, she added. ""Facing a pandemic, an economic recession and an exit from the EU all at once is not the ideal recipe for success in anyone's book. ""However, add in growing competition from challenger brands such as Aldi with a new click-and-collect service, the M&S partnership with Ocado and the looming juggernaut of Amazon entering the field of play, and getting through this period with its position intact will be no mean feat.""

"Democratic Speaker Nancy Pelosi has been in budget talks with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin US President Donald Trump has said he is ending negotiations over a Covid-19 relief bill, and will only resume talks after the election. He predicted he would win next month's election and pass a bill afterwards. US stocks fell after the announcement. Budget talks between Democratic Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin began in July. Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden said Mr Trump had ""turned his back"" on the American people. ""Make no mistake: if you are out of work, if your business is closed, if your child's school is shut down, if you are seeing layoffs in your community, Donald Trump decided today that none of that - none of it - matters to him,"" Mr Biden said in a statement on Tuesday. The Republican president  - who is himself currently being treated for Covid-19 - countered: ""Crazy Nancy Pelosi and the Radical Left Democrats were just playing 'games' with the desperately needed Workers Stimulus Payments. ""They just wanted to take care of Democrat failed, high crime, Cities and States. They were never in it to help the workers, and they never will be!"" US military leaders quarantine after positive test Unanswered questions about Trump's Covid crisis All the medication Trump is taking, explained He said he had instructed Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell to focus efforts on confirming his Supreme Court nominee Amy Coney Barrett. Mr McConnell later told reporters he supported the president's move because he believed a deal with the Democrats was looking too difficult. ""We need to concentrate on the achievable,"" he said. Lawmakers from both parties had hoped for another round of Covid-19 relief spending to pass ahead of the 3 November election, but Mr Trump's tweet appears to have abruptly suspended that prospect. It comes as coronavirus cases rise in several parts of the country, the outbreak widens among White House staff and Republican senators, and hits Pentagon top brass. The millions of Americans 'hanging by a thread' Will coronavirus change America's jobless stigma? Donald Trump's decision to kill Covid-19 relief negotiations may be a brave stand on principle, ultimately siding with conservatives who are against more massive deficit-financed spending, but it is also a very risky political move. A multi-trillion-dollar deal would have pumped stimulus into the economy at a time when the unemployment and business growth outlook is trending downward. A jobs and spending boost - or even the prospect of one - would have helped the president make the case that he, not Joe Biden, would be the best steward of the American economy for the next four years. Instead, the stock market dropped precipitously on the president's announcement, and the massive permanent layoffs that have already started in the travel and entertainment industries will continue apace. This isn't good news for Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, either, as her hardline negotiating strategy ended up with nothing to show for it. More moderate Democrats, who were already expressing frustration with the lack of a deal, will only sharpen their criticism of the Democratic leadership. Whoever wins the elections in November won't have long to savour their victories before having to face what is sure to be a large and growing economic crisis. In an all-too-familiar story of Washington gridlock, both Republicans and Democrats refused to compromise enough to meet in the middle. The White House said it would back a Covid-19 relief bill of $1.6 trillion. But Mrs Pelosi was holding out for a more generous package. Her House Democrats last week passed a $2.2tr stimulus bill, though that measure had no chance of advancing in the Republican-controlled Senate. The Senate leader had indicated he would not support any legislation with a price tag of more than $2tr. Mr Trump begrudgingly offered $250bn of funding for state and local governments. Mrs Pelosi was holding out for more than $400bn. Republicans accused her of simply seeking a bail-out for Democratic-run states facing budgetary problems stemming from before the pandemic. The White House said last week it favoured a $400 per week pandemic jobless benefit, but Democrats wanted $600. What is the economic situation in the US? Analysts have warned that the economic recovery risks stalling without further aid. While the US has regained about half the jobs lost in March and April, more than 10 million people remain unemployed. In a speech on Tuesday, the head of America's central bank, Jerome Powell, warned of ""tragic"" consequences should policymakers do too little and the pace of progress slow further. The defining moment of the Trump presidency Trump's healthcare v the average American's Trump says not to fear Covid-19. Do Americans agree? ""The expansion is still far from complete,"" he said. ""Even if policy actions ultimately prove to be greater than needed, they will not go to waste.""Â Mr Trump's unexpected announcement comes as many of the individual benefits previously approved by Congress have already run out. The new Congress will not reconvene until January, following the November elections. Mrs Pelosi accused Mr Trump of ""putting himself first at the expense of the country"". ""He shows his contempt for science, his disdain for our heroesâ¦ and he refuses to put money in workers' pockets, unless his name is printed on the cheque,"" she added. Nancy Pelosi breaks rules with hair salon visit ""Clearly, the White House is in complete disarray,"" she said, calling on Trump officials to heed Mr Powell's advice.

It comes as coronavirus cases rise in several parts of the country, the outbreak widens among White House staff and Republican senators, and hits Pentagon top brass. The millions of Americans 'hanging by a thread' Will coronavirus change America's jobless stigma? Donald Trump's decision to kill Covid-19 relief negotiations may be a brave stand on principle, ultimately siding with conservatives who are against more massive deficit-financed spending, but it is also a very risky political move. A multi-trillion-dollar deal would have pumped stimulus into the economy at a time when the unemployment and business growth outlook is trending downward. A jobs and spending boost - or even the prospect of one - would have helped the president make the case that he, not Joe Biden, would be the best steward of the American economy for the next four years. Instead, the stock market dropped precipitously on the president's announcement, and the massive permanent layoffs that have already started in the travel and entertainment industries will continue apace. This isn't good news for Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, either, as her hardline negotiating strategy ended up with nothing to show for it. More moderate Democrats, who were already expressing frustration with the lack of a deal, will only sharpen their criticism of the Democratic leadership. Whoever wins the elections in November won't have long to savour their victories before having to face what is sure to be a large and growing economic crisis. In an all-too-familiar story of Washington gridlock, both Republicans and Democrats refused to compromise enough to meet in the middle. The White House said it would back a Covid-19 relief bill of $1.6 trillion. But Mrs Pelosi was holding out for a more generous package. Her House Democrats last week passed a $2.2tr stimulus bill, though that measure had no chance of advancing in the Republican-controlled Senate. The Senate leader had indicated he would not support any legislation with a price tag of more than $2tr. Mr Trump begrudgingly offered $250bn of funding for state and local governments. Mrs Pelosi was holding out for more than $400bn. Republicans accused her of simply seeking a bail-out for Democratic-run states facing budgetary problems stemming from before the pandemic. The White House said last week it favoured a $400 per week pandemic jobless benefit, but Democrats wanted $600. What is the economic situation in the US? Analysts have warned that the economic recovery risks stalling without further aid. While the US has regained about half the jobs lost in March and April, more than 10 million people remain unemployed. In a speech on Tuesday, the head of America's central bank, Jerome Powell, warned of ""tragic"" consequences should policymakers do too little and the pace of progress slow further. The defining moment of the Trump presidency Trump's healthcare v the average American's Trump says not to fear Covid-19. Do Americans agree? ""The expansion is still far from complete,"" he said. ""Even if policy actions ultimately prove to be greater than needed, they will not go to waste.""Â Mr Trump's unexpected announcement comes as many of the individual benefits previously approved by Congress have already run out. The new Congress will not reconvene until January, following the November elections. Mrs Pelosi accused Mr Trump of ""putting himself first at the expense of the country"". ""He shows his contempt for science, his disdain for our heroesâ¦ and he refuses to put money in workers' pockets, unless his name is printed on the cheque,"" she added. Nancy Pelosi breaks rules with hair salon visit ""Clearly, the White House is in complete disarray,"" she said, calling on Trump officials to heed Mr Powell's advice.

"The BBC revealed how criminal gangs had set up fake companies to claim loans. Up to 60% of emergency pandemic loans made under the Bounce Back scheme may never be repaid, a report by the government's spending watchdog says. The National Audit Office (NAO) said taxpayers could lose as much as Â£26bn, from fraud, organised crime or default. The lending scheme carried lighter checks than others and was aimed at small businesses unable to access other pandemic funding support. A recent BBC investigation revealedhow fraudsters were using the loan system. Many of those affected will have no idea their names have been used until repayment letters begin arriving in early summer. One of the victims spoken to by the BBC, Mark Telling, said he was worried ""to death"" to discover a company set up in his name by a criminal had ""borrowed"" Â£50,000 from the bail-out scheme. The BBC also spoke to Sue Burden, who had also found her identity had been stolen to set up a bogus company to access the scheme. She said she had gone ""from tears to anger... now I'm going to be scared to do anything"". The BBC reported last weekthat the government was warned back in Maythat the scheme was at ""very high risk of fraud"" from ""organised crime"". The government said it has tried to minimise fraud through lenders' background checks. The scheme provides firms with 100% government-backed finance worth up to Â£50,000. Demand has been greater than anticipated, and the total value of these loans is now expected to be Â£38bn-Â£48bn, up from an estimate of Â£18bn-Â£26bn. They do not have to be paid off for 10 years and offer a range of flexible payment options. The  loan scheme is an extension of earlier offers which some businesses complained they could not access as the lending criteria was too strict. The NAO report warned that the speed with which the scheme was rolled out heightened the fraud risk. It took a month to ensure businesses could not receive more than one loan. 'My name was used to steal a government Covid loan' Arrest over Â£110k Covid small business loan fraud UK banks get 100,000 loan applications on first day The Public Accounts Committee said it was the government's largest and most risky business support scheme. It says it will not assess the value-for-money of the scheme, as the loans will not start being paid back until May next year. The NAO analysis said losses from the scheme are likely to reach ""significantly above"" normal estimates for public-sector fraud of 0.5% to 5%. The report also said the UK's five biggest banks will make nearly Â£1bn between them from the scheme. Meg Hillier, chair of the Public Accounts Committee, said the loans had been a vital lifeline for many businesses. But she added that ""the government estimates that up to 60% of the loans could turn bad - this would be a truly eye-watering loss of public money"". ""The bounce back loan scheme got money into the hands of small businesses quickly, and will have stopped some from going under. ""But the scheme's hasty launch means criminals may have helped themselves to billions of pounds at the taxpayer's expense. ""Sadly, many firms won't be able to repay their loans and the banks will be quick to wash their hands of the problem. Today's report confirms what many people had suspected. In May, the government had to get money to small businesses as quickly as possible, before tens of thousands of them went bust. But to do that, they had to make compromises on credit and fraud checks.  This opened the doors to a whole range of problems - including fraud by organised criminal gangs. We've found evidence of more than 100 bogus firms set up by scammers to make fraudulent applications - getting the maximum Â£50,000 each time. They've used the stolen, personal details of innocent victims to set up the fake companies - victims who won't know anything about it until the letters demanding repayment start arriving through their doors next summer. How it's done: Gangs steal victims' personal details using phishing emails or buying them on criminal forums. They then set up a bogus business in their name. After opening a business bank account they then apply for a Bounce Back Loan through the same bank. The taxpayer is in the same position - waiting to find out how much the scheme will ultimately cost us.  The warning from the National Audit Office is clear - it has the potential to be ""very high"". Sue and Dave Burden, from the south of England, were shocked to find that Sue's identity had been stolen to set up a company and claim a bounce back loan. ""I've gone from tears to anger,"" she told the BBC. ""Now I'm going to be scared to do anything."" The state-owned British Business Bank (BBB), which supervises the bounce back loan scheme, twice raised concerns, firstly in May. The BBB expects it will pay out Â£1.07bn in interest payments to the high street lenders that provided the cash. Most of this will go to UK's five biggest banks, Barclays, HSBC, Lloyds, NatWest and Santander, which provided Â£31.3bn of funding. According to latest Treasury figures,external, there have been 1.55 million applications for the loans, with 1.26 million approvals. ""We targeted this support to help those who need it most as quickly as possible and we won't apologise for this,"" a government spokesperson said. ""We've looked to minimise fraud - with lenders implementing a range of protections including anti-money laundering and customer checks, as well as transaction monitoring controls. ""Any fraudulent applications can be criminally prosecuted for which penalties include imprisonment or a fine or both."" Have you been affected by the issues raised in this story?

Our writers were Becky Morton, Emma Harrison, Doug Faulkner, Joshua Nevett, and Yaroslav Lukov. The editors were Jasmine Taylor-Coleman, Helier Cheung, and Owen Amos. This video can not be played Covid in Scotland: FM announces tougher rules on hospitality As our live page draws to a close, here are some of the headlines from across the UK today: Harris and Pence will debate from behind plexiglass panels on Wednesday night Weâre pausing our live coverage of the coronavirus pandemic soon. In case you missed them, here are some of the main developments from around the world today. All teaching at Newcastle and Northumbria universities will switch online from Thursday for a minimum of three weeks after hundreds of students tested positive for Covid-19. More than 750 Northumbria University students have tested positive for the virus as have more than 100 students and staff at Newcastle University. They join the University of Manchester, Manchester Metropolitan University and the University of Sheffield which have switched to online learning to protect the health of students and staff. Sheffield Hallam University has also decided to increase the number of online lessons it offers over the next two weeks after it recorded 373 cases of Covid-19 among students and staff. The Newcastle universities said they made the decision in consultation with the area's director of public health and the city council. Staff at Northumbria had called on vice-chancellor Andrew Wathey to resign as University and College Union (UCU) members agreed toballot for industrial action over safety concerns. Laura KuenssbergPolitical editor However you look at the blizzard of statistics about the coronavirus, the disease is still spreading - despite town after town being placed under extra limits. Even beforeNicola Sturgeon's moves on Wednesdayto try to break the spread in Scotland, ministers in Westminster were looking at the next steps they would need to take to stop the acceleration of the virus. As we've reported, the government is likely to introduce a tiered approach to put different parts of the country with different spreads of the diseases into different categories. But the exact nature of the strictest form of restrictions are yet to be set in stone. It's a complicated equation. The Department of Health is worried about the spread of the disease, as well as other patients losing out on other treatments because of the focus on Covid. No 11 is fearful about the impact on the economy, which has already had a profound shock. And it's No 10's job to worry about all of it, then reach a conclusion. It's clear that shutting pubs and restaurants is a possibility - the ""circuit breaker"" that we have talked about on here lots of times. But there are many questions still to be settled. Read more from Laura here The world-famous annual Parish Fashion Week has been held in the French capital - and this year's ""must-have"" was the face mask Among the many celebrities who decided to drop in was US tennis player Venus Williams (centre) The event ran from 28 September to 6 October - will this year's must-have still be on show in 2021? As we reported a moment ago, the White Houseâs doctor said tests on President Trump had found âdetectable levelsâ of antibodies against Covid-19 in his body. But what are antibodies in the first place? Some experts see them as the ""warriors"" of the bodyâs immune system. When coronavirus infects your body, the immune system produces antibodies, which attach to the spikes of the virus, blocking it from entering your cells. This is why vaccines are considered so important to ending the pandemic. A vaccine stimulates your immune system to produce antibodies, exactly like it would if you were exposed to the disease, thus training the body to fight the virus. You canread more about the progress being made on vaccines against coronavirus here. As the charts show, the number of people with Covid-19 needing hospital treatment is highest in the north of England. The number of UK cases announced on Wednesday - 14,162 - was slightly down on Tuesday's figure. But the seven-day rolling average is still pointing upwards.  The number of people dying with Covid-19 is also increasing - but far less sharply. Jenny HillBBC Berlin correspondent A curfew has been imposed in Berlin to curb the spread of the virus People living in parts of Berlin and other coronavirus hotspots in Germany will be prohibited from staying in hotels in the rest of the country from Thursday. Senior politicians from each of the 16 German states met online today to discuss rising number of infections in the country. Nationwide, there were 2,828 new cases and 16 deaths recorded in the last 24 hours. Infections have been rising steadily since August in Germany, increasing by more than 2,000 a day recently,World Health Organization (WHO) data shows,external. The capital Berlin announced a late-night curfew on restaurants and bars on Tuesday. Four districts of Berlin are particularly badly affected and are among at least seven so-called hotspots, where cases exceed 50 per 100,000 people for seven days. President Donald Trump has been ""symptom-free for over 24 hours"" and has not needed extra oxygen since he was admitted to hospital with Covid-19, the White House's physician has said. In a memo, Dr Sean Conley said the president's vital signs, including his oxygen saturation, ""remain stable and within a normal range"". The president told the physician this morning ""I feel great!"", the memo says. ""He's now been fever-free for more than four days,"" the doctor said, adding that tests showed Trump has developed antibodies against the virus. Allow Twitter content?

Experts fear the coronavirus situation in Iran could be much worse than official figures show The daily coronavirus death toll is on the worrying trajectory in Iran, where a record 239 died with Covid-19 in the past 24 hours. That increase brings Iranâs overall death toll to 27,658 since the pandemic began, the countryâs health ministry reported on Wednesday. It has the highest official death toll and confirmed number of infections in the Middle East, according to Johns Hopkins University. A further 4,019 cases were also registered on 7 October, pushing the total number of people who have officially tested positive in the country to 483,844. Today's rise in infections is the second highest since the outbreak began, the highest being 4,151 a day earlier. Authorities have attributed the rise in cases to an increase in testing and people flouting social-distancing rules, butanalysis by BBC Reality Checkreveals a more nuanced picture. Iran has the highest number of coronavirus cases in the Middle East Antonin Panenka's cheeky winning penalty technique has been copied by some of the game's greats Czech football legend Antonin Panenka, who scored an audacious winning penalty to see Czechoslovakia win the 1976 European Championships, has been admitted to hospital with Covid-19, his former club has announced. In a tweet, Czech club Bohemians Praha 1905 said the former attacking midfielder was in intensive care, describing his condition as ""serious"". Bohemians said the 71-year-old had been connected to a machine but did not specify whether it was a mechanical ventilator or life support machine.

Italy's government is moving to make masks compulsory in outdoor spaces Italy has recorded 3,678 new coronavirus infections over the past 24 hours, the biggest daily rise since mid-April when the country was under a national lockdown. It was the steepest 24-hour rise since 17 April, when 3,786 new infections were reported,according to the World Health Organization (WHO),external. In recent weeks, coronavirus infections have been rising at a steadier rate than during the first wave of the pandemic, when the Italian government imposed one of the strictest nationwide lockdowns in the world. That lockdown inflicted heavy economic costs, but brought contagion under control by the summer, allowing the government to reopen restaurants, bars and shops. Now, as winter approaches and indoor gatherings become more common, the virus is spreading once again, a trend seen across Europe. However, there are still far fewer daily infections in Italy than elsewhere in Europe, with France, Spain and the UK all registering thousands more cases per day.

Education Secretary John Swinney said a full exam diet during the continuing coronavirus pandemic was ""too big a risk"". Schools are to remain open but Mr Swinney said it was likely students would still face disruption - meaning an ""alternative approach"" was needed. Watch his statement above. President Trump returned to the White House on Monday night Earlier we reported comments by White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow, who said President Trump had returned to work at the Oval Office as he recuperates from Covid-19. Speaking to CNBC, Kudlow said ""the president actually showed up in the Oval Office yesterday with extra precautions"" but refused to go into specifics when asked if Trump had worn a mask. Moments later, those remarks were contradicted by a top aide to the president. ""While the President wanted to be in the Oval Office yesterday, he was not there - he stayed back in the residence working from there,"" tweeted Ben Williamson, a spokesman for the president.

You may want to readTwitterâs cookie policy,externalandprivacy policy,externalbefore accepting. To view this content chooseâaccept and continueâ. In a further clarification, White House chief of staff Mark Meadows said Kudlow misspoke. Meadows said staff were still preparing for Trumpâs return to the Oval Office - less than a week after his Covid-19 diagnosis was announced on 2 October. âIf he decides to go to the Oval we've got safety protocols there,â Meadows said. Confusion over messaging has been a common theme since Trump's diagnosis, with White House officials and doctors giving conflicting information on the president's condition and the timeline of his illness. Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent On Tuesday it was revealed hospital admissions in England linked to Covid had jumped by a quarter in a day. But the latest daily figures show that has not been repeated â the numbers admitted actually show a small drop to 472. The North West, North East and Yorkshire are once again the worst hit areas. But the figures still suggest admissions are doubling around every two weeks. That is a worrying trend, but is a long way from the rapid rises seen in the spring when the UK hit 3,000 admissions a day very quickly. Admissions for respiratory illnesses always climb at this time of year. By December you would expect to see 1,000 people a day taken in to hospital for conditions such as flu. What we do not know yet is whether flu and other respiratory viruses are going to have the same impact they do normally or by how much Covid hospitalisations will continue to rise. Admissions are, arguably, the most important measure we have. They are a sign of how many people are actually seriously ill with the virus and provide important information about the pressure the NHS is under. A pub owner has warned new restrictions on the hospitality sector in Scotland are a ""nightmare"", despite saying that the measures were ""inevitable"". Steve Whiting, owner of the Halfway House pub in Edinburgh, said: ""It's been an incredibly difficult time for the hospitality sector, first we had the social distancing then we had the curfew now we have a two-week shutdown."" He said many cafes and pubs would have to lose stock and it would cause issues with staffing. ""It is just a nightmare for hospitality,"" he said. Mr Whiting, who has had to make three staff members redundant, said small businesses would need further financial support. Scotland's Education Secretary John Swinney said that ""we cannot plan on business as usual"" but there would not be an algorithm to decide grades. He said: ""First and foremost, awards will not be given â or taken away - on the basis of a statistical model nor on the basis of a schoolâs past performance. There will be no algorithm."" Mr Swinney and First Minister Nicola Sturgeonapologised earlier this yearafter an algorithm downgraded 125,000 grades, with results being ""stacked against"" pupils in more deprived areas. Mr Swinney said not having National 5 exams - normally sat by pupils aged 15 and 16 - would mean that a higher and advanced higher exam diet could be created to be as safe as it could be. ""The exams that determine most people's future path into work, college or university can go ahead as long as the public health guidance allows it,"" he said He said the additional time freed up by cancelling the National 5 exams could be used to make up in lost education time from this academic year. Advanced Higher and Higher exams will now begin on 13 May, later than usual. Pence's team had resisted the installation of plexiglass panels Anticipation is building for the first and only vice-presidential debate between Vice-President Mike Pence and Democratic challenger Kamala Harris in Salt Lake City, Utah, on Wednesday night. When the pair lock horns on stage, thereâll be more than just political divisions on display. Wearing masks, Harris and Pence will be seated more than 3.7m (12ft) apart, each with a plexiglass screen in front of them to mitigate the risk of coronavirus transmission. Event staff were seen erecting the plexiglass partitions on the debate stage. Harris requested for there to be panels between her and Pence Pence's team had opposed the barriers, deeming them unnecessary, but on Tuesday night agreed to have them installed. The dispute came amida growing number of positive cases among the inner circle of President Trump, who is continuing his recovery from Covid-19 at the White House. Both Pence and Harris have tested negative for coronavirus in recent days. At their debate, guests will be required to wear masks at all times and undergo coronavirus checks upon entry to the venue. The BBC will be running a live page of tonight's debate, so check back in with the website a few hours from now if you want live coverage of all the twists and turns.

"Warning letters sent to those falling seriously behind on debts are to be toned down to make them less ""thuggish"", under government plans. Long-standing laws require warnings about potential court action to be written in bold or in block capitals. A campaign by the Money and Mental Health Policy Institute claimed the letters were counter-productive and worsened mental health problems. Now the Treasury has vowed they should be ""less threatening"". However, the changes may not be fully implemented until mid-2021. Under the rules of the Consumer Credit Act from 1974, warnings in these letters should be written in capitals or in bold. For example, the letter states: ""IF YOU DO NOT TAKE THE ACTION REQUIRED BY THIS NOTICE BEFORE THE DATE SHOWN THEN THE FURTHER ACTION SET OUT BELOW MAY BE TAKEN AGAINST YOU."" The institute said that this ""complex and intimidating"" language risked adding further distress to those already facing mental health difficulties. According to estimates produced by the institute, about 100,000 people in problem debt in England attempted suicide last year. Rachel Edwards said the letters made things worse Rachel Edwards is among those who have received debt letters after bouts of depression led to financial problems. ""You get these letters and they make you bury your head even further - and that makes both your mental health and your debt problems worse,"" Mrs Edwards, from Bridgend,told BBC News in June. ""You know what they are, you open them to look at what you owe, then put them on the side and leave them there."" She said the proposed changes announced by the Treasury were vitally important. ""It will make a big difference, especially for people like me who have mental health problems as well as debt,"" she said. The Treasury said the new rules should make the letters less threatening by restricting the amount of information that must be made prominent, and required lenders to use bold or underlined text rather than capital letters. Lenders would also be able to replace legal terms with more everyday language, and letters would clearly signpost people to the best sources of free debt advice. Economic secretary to the Treasury John Glen said: ""These new rules will help to take the fear out of finance by ensuring that letters are easier to understand, less threatening, and empower people to take control of their finances."" Martin Lewis, who founded the Money and Mental Health Policy Institute, said: ""It is no exaggeration to say that this change could save lives. ""The last thing people struggling with debt need is a bunch of thuggish letters dropping through the letterbox, in language they can't understand, written in shouty capitals alongside threats of court action.Â ""The timing is crucial, with millions of people facing debt and distress due to the pandemic, the sooner we end these out-of-date laws which force lenders to send intimidating letters the better.""

"Supermarket giant Tesco has seen first-half profits rise by more than a quarter as customers bought more food during the pandemic and online orders doubled. Pre-tax profit for the 26 weeks to 29 August was Â£551m, 28.7% up on 2019. It isTesco's first set of results under its new chief executive,external, Ken Murphy, who started last week. He replaces Dave Lewis, who had been running the UK's biggest retailer since 2014. With more customers turning to online shopping, Tesco more than doubled delivery capacity to 1.5 million slots a week during the first half, including serving 674,000 vulnerable customers. While demand for food rose, clothing fared less well, with sales down 17.2%. Like many of its rivals, Tesco was forced to overhaul its strategy in-store and online amid the coronavirus lockdown. Mr Murphy told a conference call with journalists the first half of this year had ""tested our business in ways we had never imagined"", but employees had ""risen brilliantly to every challenge"". He said he felt ""very comfortable in my own skin and my ability to lead this business"". ""I'm really happy with the strategy and direction of the company,"" he added. ""My job is to maintain momentum in the business and deliver a fantastic Christmas."" Tesco is in the process of selling its businesses in Thailand, Malaysia and Poland, but Mr Murphy said there was currently ""no plan for further retrenchment"". When Dave Lewis was parachuted into the top job in Tesco in 2014, the business was in crisis. Now Ken Murphy is presiding over his first set of results and Britain's biggest retailer is doing rather well. The business, he says, is in ""great shape"". But his job is going to be far from easy. He's got to steer Tesco through the ongoing Covid-19 crisis during the key festive trading period. Then there's the impact of a potential no-deal Brexit looming on the horizon. And as the job losses start to mount, shoppers' budgets will be coming under increasing pressure. The battle for our wallets is set to become even more intense. Finally, now that Tesco's turnaround is complete, Mr Murphy will have to focus in the longer term on how to grow the business. A new chapter begins. Operating profit figures told a different story, however, falling 15.6% to Â£1.037bn. One of the items dragging down the balance sheet was Tesco Bank, which made a loss of Â£155m. Tesco said sales in the UK and Ireland rose 8.6% to Â£24.3bn, with overall revenue of Â£28.7bn. But it added that coronavirus-related costs had hit Â£533m. UK food sales went up 9.2% during the period, the retailer said. Ocado takes Tesco's most valuable retailer slot Tesco targets 300% rise in vegan meat sales The supermarket said it was increasing its interim dividend by 21% to 3.2p a share. It also named a new chief financial officer, Imran Nawaz, who is joining from Tate & Lyle. He will succeed Alan Stewart, who is retiring in April. ""In spite of these positive results, Tesco will still have concerns afterits valuation dropped below Ocado,"" said Julie Palmer, partner at Begbies Traynor. And even though Dave Lewis had left ""a well-oiled machine"" behind him, it would not be an easy ride for Mr Murphy as the new chief executive, she added. ""Facing a pandemic, an economic recession and an exit from the EU all at once is not the ideal recipe for success in anyone's book. ""However, add in growing competition from challenger brands such as Aldi with a new click-and-collect service, the M&S partnership with Ocado and the looming juggernaut of Amazon entering the field of play, and getting through this period with its position intact will be no mean feat.""

"The BBC revealed how criminal gangs had set up fake companies to claim loans. Up to 60% of emergency pandemic loans made under the Bounce Back scheme may never be repaid, a report by the government's spending watchdog says. The National Audit Office (NAO) said taxpayers could lose as much as Â£26bn, from fraud, organised crime or default. The lending scheme carried lighter checks than others and was aimed at small businesses unable to access other pandemic funding support. A recent BBC investigation revealedhow fraudsters were using the loan system. Many of those affected will have no idea their names have been used until repayment letters begin arriving in early summer. One of the victims spoken to by the BBC, Mark Telling, said he was worried ""to death"" to discover a company set up in his name by a criminal had ""borrowed"" Â£50,000 from the bail-out scheme. The BBC also spoke to Sue Burden, who had also found her identity had been stolen to set up a bogus company to access the scheme. She said she had gone ""from tears to anger... now I'm going to be scared to do anything"". The BBC reported last weekthat the government was warned back in Maythat the scheme was at ""very high risk of fraud"" from ""organised crime"". The government said it has tried to minimise fraud through lenders' background checks. The scheme provides firms with 100% government-backed finance worth up to Â£50,000. Demand has been greater than anticipated, and the total value of these loans is now expected to be Â£38bn-Â£48bn, up from an estimate of Â£18bn-Â£26bn. They do not have to be paid off for 10 years and offer a range of flexible payment options. The  loan scheme is an extension of earlier offers which some businesses complained they could not access as the lending criteria was too strict. The NAO report warned that the speed with which the scheme was rolled out heightened the fraud risk. It took a month to ensure businesses could not receive more than one loan. 'My name was used to steal a government Covid loan' Arrest over Â£110k Covid small business loan fraud UK banks get 100,000 loan applications on first day The Public Accounts Committee said it was the government's largest and most risky business support scheme. It says it will not assess the value-for-money of the scheme, as the loans will not start being paid back until May next year. The NAO analysis said losses from the scheme are likely to reach ""significantly above"" normal estimates for public-sector fraud of 0.5% to 5%. The report also said the UK's five biggest banks will make nearly Â£1bn between them from the scheme. Meg Hillier, chair of the Public Accounts Committee, said the loans had been a vital lifeline for many businesses. But she added that ""the government estimates that up to 60% of the loans could turn bad - this would be a truly eye-watering loss of public money"". ""The bounce back loan scheme got money into the hands of small businesses quickly, and will have stopped some from going under. ""But the scheme's hasty launch means criminals may have helped themselves to billions of pounds at the taxpayer's expense. ""Sadly, many firms won't be able to repay their loans and the banks will be quick to wash their hands of the problem. Today's report confirms what many people had suspected. In May, the government had to get money to small businesses as quickly as possible, before tens of thousands of them went bust. But to do that, they had to make compromises on credit and fraud checks.  This opened the doors to a whole range of problems - including fraud by organised criminal gangs. We've found evidence of more than 100 bogus firms set up by scammers to make fraudulent applications - getting the maximum Â£50,000 each time. They've used the stolen, personal details of innocent victims to set up the fake companies - victims who won't know anything about it until the letters demanding repayment start arriving through their doors next summer. How it's done: Gangs steal victims' personal details using phishing emails or buying them on criminal forums. They then set up a bogus business in their name. After opening a business bank account they then apply for a Bounce Back Loan through the same bank. The taxpayer is in the same position - waiting to find out how much the scheme will ultimately cost us.  The warning from the National Audit Office is clear - it has the potential to be ""very high"". Sue and Dave Burden, from the south of England, were shocked to find that Sue's identity had been stolen to set up a company and claim a bounce back loan. ""I've gone from tears to anger,"" she told the BBC. ""Now I'm going to be scared to do anything."" The state-owned British Business Bank (BBB), which supervises the bounce back loan scheme, twice raised concerns, firstly in May. The BBB expects it will pay out Â£1.07bn in interest payments to the high street lenders that provided the cash. Most of this will go to UK's five biggest banks, Barclays, HSBC, Lloyds, NatWest and Santander, which provided Â£31.3bn of funding. According to latest Treasury figures,external, there have been 1.55 million applications for the loans, with 1.26 million approvals. ""We targeted this support to help those who need it most as quickly as possible and we won't apologise for this,"" a government spokesperson said. ""We've looked to minimise fraud - with lenders implementing a range of protections including anti-money laundering and customer checks, as well as transaction monitoring controls. ""Any fraudulent applications can be criminally prosecuted for which penalties include imprisonment or a fine or both."" Have you been affected by the issues raised in this story?

"QAnon influencers have big audiences on social media Facebook has banned all accounts linked to the QAnon conspiracy theory movement from its platforms. ""Starting today, we will remove Facebook Pages, Groups and Instagram accounts,"" the company said on Tuesday. The move is a significant escalation to Facebook's earlier decision to remove or restrict groups and accounts sharing and promoting  QAnon material. QAnon is a conspiracy theory that says President Trump is waging a war against elite Satan-worshipping paedophiles. In a statement released on Tuesday, Facebook said its staff had begun removing content and deleting groups and pages, but that ""this work will take time and will continue in the coming days and weeks"". ""Our Dangerous Organizations Operations team will continue to enforce this policy and proactively detect content for removal instead of relying on user reports,"" the statement added. Facebook takes action on conspiracy groups QAnon: What is it and where did it come from? Facebook said it was updating measures implemented in August, which aimed to ""disrupt the ability of QAnon"" to organise through - and operate on - its networks. That policy - introduced to limit the risks to public safety posed by QAnon, ""offline anarchist groups"" and US-based militia organisations - resulted inrestrictions on more than 1,950 Facebook groups and over 10,000 Instagram accounts. This is a big move from Facebook, which has laid out how it plans to proactively remove all evolving QAnon content from its platforms. It comes after I asked Facebook's vice-president of global affairs, Nick Clegg, why the site still allows QAnon to spread political disinformation to US voters and beyond using hashtags like #SaveOurChildren. Facebook's first crackdown on this dangerous conspiracy theory focused on violent content plugged by those supporting it, removing a number of groups and pages. But those supporting QAnon soon adapted, using new palatable hashtags to reach parent groups, local forums and the average Instagram feed. And the movement kept growing. This latest move will be welcomed - but will also be very hard to enforce, especially since QAnon has become so big and spread under new guises. I recently spoke to US voters about how QAnon disinformation about candidates and child trafficking rings could already have impacted their friends and neighbours ahead of polling day. They explained how people they know now believe totally unfounded claims they've seen on Instagram and Facebook about the Democrats running a child-trafficking ring or presidential candidate Joe Biden abusing children. Could this move - like the last - also be too late? Facebook is not the only social media giant to look at tackling the QAnon conspiracy movement. In July,Twitter banned thousands of accounts and said it would stop recommending content linked to QAnonin an attempt to help prevent ""offline harm"". It also said it would block URLs associated with the group from being shared on the platform. In October 2017, an anonymous user put a series of posts on the message board 4chan. The user signed off as ""Q"" and claimed to have a level of US security approval known as ""Q clearance"". These messages became known as ""Q drops"" or ""breadcrumbs"", often written in cryptic language peppered with slogans, pledges and pro-Trump themes. This video can not be played Trump on QAnon: 'They do like me' The amount of traffic to mainstream social networking sites like Facebook, Twitter, Reddit and YouTube has exploded since 2017, and indications are that numbers have increased during the coronavirus pandemic. Judging by social media, there are hundreds of thousands of people who believe in at least some of the bizarre theories offered up by QAnon. QAnon followed on from the ""pizzagate"" saga in 2016 - a fake theory about Democratic Party politicians running a paedophile ring out of a Washington pizza restaurant.

"Government plans to relax development rules could result in the loss of much-needed homes, council leaders say. Sites of up to 40 or 50 houses could be temporarily exempted from affordable housing contributions under proposals put forward last month. The Local Government Association said if the plan had been in place over the last 18 months, it would have led to nearly 10,000 fewer affordable homes. But ministers say the move will help small firms recover from Covid. The current rules in England mean developers which have sites with more than 10 houses either have to build or pay towards affordable housing, while those with 10 homes or fewer are exempt from the contribution. The government isconsulting on,externalraising this threshold for 18 months to help ""minimise the economic pressure"" on small developers in the wake of coronavirus. Johnson defends 'long overdue' planning overhaul Is it true planning permission takes five years? Labour loses bid to overturn planning reforms The proposal - which ministers say could be confirmed this autumn - forms part ofsweeping changes to the planning system in England. The government has acknowledged a higher threshold would lead to a reduction in contributions towards affordable housing via so-called Section 106 agreements. These deals see developers negotiate with a council to build a certain number of affordable homes, or contribute cash towards them. But the government argues removing the need for these negotiations to take place will make more sites financially viable for smaller developers. The LGA, which represents councils in England and Wales, said the plan could lead to a significant reduction in affordable housing. It commissioned analysis that estimated the proposals would have led to 9,072 fewer affordable homes built on sites of 10 to 49 units in the last 18 months. Over the the last five years, this figure would have been nearly 30,000, the body warned. David Renard, a Conservative councillor and housing spokesman for the LGA, said the government proposal was of ""huge concern"". He said it risked allowing developers to ""game the system"" by putting forward schemes just below the new threshold to avoid building affordable housing. ""With rising housing waiting lists and record numbers in temporary accommodation, we desperately need to be building more affordable housing, not less,"" he said. ""We need to build homes that are affordable to local people and help to reduce homelessness, rather than contributing additional funds to developers' and landowners' profits."" The Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government said a temporary change would help small builders deliver housing more quickly. A spokesperson added plans to replace Section 106 agreements with a new infrastructure levy would ""ensure developers pay their way"". They added that the new national charge - also announced last month - would deliver ""at least as much, if not more, onsite affordable housing than today"", and that the the Â£11.5bn Affordable Homes Programme ""will deliver up to 180,000 new affordable homes across the country.""

"The Leeds businessman Manni Hussain handed over 45 properties after investigators used an Unexplained Wealth Order Around Â£10m of property has been surrendered in a major victory against some of northern England's most dangerous criminals. The apartments and homes were given up to the National Crime Agency by a Leeds businessman who investigators suspect of being a major money-launderer. The NCA says Mansoor Mahmood Hussain acted for gangsters, including a murderer and drug trafficker. The agency believes he laundered their profits through a property empire. Over two decades, Mr Hussain, known as Manni, developed his portfolio across West Yorkshire, Cheshire and London while posing as a legitimate businessman. His social media accounts show him living a luxury lifestyle involving high-performance cars, executive jets, super-yachts and appearances at VIP events attended by celebrities. He filled his timeline with pictures of the famous - although there is no suggestion that any of VIPs he posed with knew who he was. VIP events: Mr Hussain showed off his purported lifestyle on social media. Here with BeyoncÃ©... While the 40-year-old has never been convicted of a crime, investigators say they had intelligence linking him to serious gangsters - but could not obtain the detailed evidence needed for charges of money laundering. Instead, in 2019, they turned to the relatively new power of an Unexplained Wealth Order which required the businessman to open his books and show how his wealth had come from legitimate sources. The NCA has now announced that Mr Hussain has given up fighting the case against him and has agreed a settlement in which he has handed over the vast majority of his empire - 45 properties, apartments, offices and homes. The settlement also includes the brand name Poundworld, which Mr Hussain bought after the original chain's demise. As part of the settlement, the NCA has left him with four small properties that are still mortgaged, and cash in a bank account that was not part of the original investigation. ....Grabbing a picture with Meghan Markle Graeme Biggar, head of economic crime at the NCA, said: ""This case is a milestone, demonstrating the power of Unexplained Wealth Orders, with significant implications for how we pursue illicit finance in the UK. ""This ground-breaking investigation has recovered millions of pounds worth of criminally-obtained property. ""It is crucial for the economic health of local communities such as Leeds, and for the country as a whole, that we ensure property and other assets are held legitimately."" ...And hobnobbing with Simon Cowell The biggest single property handed over to the NCA is a high-specification apartment and office development, Cubic, on the outskirts of Leeds, which Mr Hussain wholly owned through one of his many companies. The other properties include a home on one of the city's most expensive roads, an apartment opposite Harrods in London and terraced housing in Leeds and Bradford. Once all the property is eventually sold, the profits will be split 50/50 between the investigatory agency and central government. In High Court legal papers, the NCA said it believed the seed money for Cubic's development and other property purchases must have come from Mr Hussain's criminal associates because they could find no legitimate source for his wealth. He had paid virtually no income tax in some years and many of his 77 companies were dormant. The court was told Mr Hussain was thought to be a ""clean skin"" - a businessman free of convictions, acting as a professional money-launderer. Today the NCA said one of the developer's closest associates was Bradford gangster Mohammed Nisar Khan, known on the street as ""Meggy"". Last yearhe was jailed for life for murder- and investigators have long considered him one of the most significant organised crime bosses in northern England, involved in drug and firearms trafficking operations. ""Meggy"" Khan: Close associate of the property developer Mr Hussain has been close to Mohammed Khan since 2005 and frequently drove him to and from court, according to evidence gathered by investigators. He also paid a Â£134,000 confiscation order for Khan's brother, Shamsher, who had been separately convicted of money laundering. The NCA also said that Dennis Slade, who once headed an armed robbery gang, stayed rent-free in Mr Hussain's seven-bedroom Leeds home - one of the properties he's now surrendered. This seven-bedroom home on Sandmoor Drive in Leeds has been handed over to the NCA The highly unusual outcome of the investigation - including the settlement leaving the target with some property - comes after the future of the UWO powers was in doubt. Of the four cases launched since the orders were created, two are still being fought through the courts while the NCA lost the third after the High Court ruled the individuals being targeted had no case to answer. The NCA today defended the decision to settle the Hussain case, saying Manni Hussain had been left with virtually nothing other than heavily mortgaged properties - and it had saved the taxpayer time and money by discouraging him from launching a potentially long and expensive legal battle. Investigators say that the settlement included no promise to Mr Hussain that he would not be investigated again in the future. Duncan Hames of Transparency International, an anti-corruption and white collar crime campaign group that lobbied for the introduction of UWOs, welcomed the outcome of the case. ""What's important is that there is a high level of transparency so people can see justice being done,"" said Mr Hames. ""Given the challenges on the court system, we need to be grateful when cases are brought to a conclusion - but we need to see many more of them."" The BBC has attempted to contact Mr Hussain for comment.

"Pubs, restaurants and visitor attractions are concerned about the possible impact of new restrictions on their businesses The Scottish government is expected to announce stricter restrictions on licensed premises as part of efforts to slow a surge in coronavirus cases. It is thought that the new rules may be focused on pubs and restaurants in areas with higher levels of the virus. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has already said the new measures will not be a return to full lockdown. The virus has been spreading particularly quickly in the central belt of Scotland. It is expected that the new rules will be primarily focused on ""hotspot"" areas, such as the Greater Glasgow and Clyde, Lanarkshire, Lothian, Forth Valley and Ayrshire and Arran health board areas. The Scottish Sun newspaper has said that a series of documents apparently giving details of the new rules for the hospitality sector have beenleaked to its journalists,external. Check the Covid restrictions where you are How many cases are there in your area? Live updates on Nicola Sturgeon's speech Ms Sturgeon will confirm the new measures in a speech to the Scottish Parliament at about 14:50 BST. The licensed trade has called on the Scottish government to provide financial support for any businesses that are affected. The first minister said in June that she believed Scotland was""not far away""from eliminating the virus. But the number of people testing positive has increased sharply in recent weeks - in keeping with some other parts of the UK and Europe - despite Scotland generally taking a more cautious approach to the virus than England. Figures released on Wednesday showed that Scotland recorded more than 1,000 new confirmed cases of the virus in a single day for the first time - although the country is doing far more testing now than at the height of the pandemic earlier in the year. About 730 new cases are being recorded every day in Scotland on average - compared with 285 a fortnight ago - with the number of people dying or being admitted to hospital also increasing. Across the UK, a further14,542 cases were confirmed on Tuesday,external- a figure that has trebled in a fortnight. Last month, people in Scotland were banned from visiting other homes, with strict limits also in force for outdoor meetings and a 22:00 curfew imposed for pubs and restaurants. Ms Sturgeon said on Tuesday that the rising number of cases meant ""additional targeted steps"" were now needed if the country was to attempt to bring the virus back under control before winter. When the 10pm pub curfew was announced a fortnight ago, Nicola Sturgeon made clear she would like to go further in restricting hospitality. The reason she gave for not doing so was the limited capacity of the Scottish government to financially support affected businesses. Talks with the UK government have not resolved that issue yet, but the Scottish government is sufficiently alarmed by rising case numbers that it has decided to act anyway. The trading hours and licensing conditions for pubs and restaurants are likely to be restricted further and these restrictions may be heaviest in the central belt of Scotland, where the prevalence of the virus is strongest. The details were being debated and decided at a special meeting of the Scottish cabinet this morning. Affected businesses are likely to be offered some additional financial help from the Scottish government, while it continues to press for further Treasury support. Today's Scotland-only measures may not amount to the ""short, sharp, shock"" of the much discussed ""circuit-breaker"" - but they may not be the last restrictions to be imposed this autumn either. Tourism and hospitality industry leaders have warned that many businesses will never recover from the impact of any further restrictions. But the first minister has said the new measures would seek to strike a balance between protecting health and the economy. She has already ruled out a nationwide travel ban or the possibility of people being told to stay at home, and has pledged that schools will only close for the duration of the October holidays. It seems likely the new restrictions will primarily be targeted at ""hotspot"" areas with high levels of the virus, potentially alongside some new but possibly less stringent national measures. This video can not be played The first minister said on Monday the new measures would not amount to the lockdown seen in March The rising number of cases in some cities was partly driven by a series of major outbreaks on university campuses - although the virus is increasingly being transmitted to older people too. Many more rural areas have seen far fewer cases - and have questioned the need for any new rules to apply to them. Paul Waterson, of the Scottish Licensed Trade Association, said the prospect of tighter restrictions following the 22:00 closure time for pubs and restaurants was already affecting the industry ""very badly"". He told BBC Breakfast that Scotland could lose about a third of its pubs and about 25% of staff - or 12,500 people. What might the new measures look like? Tourism and hospitality sectors fear new restrictions What new rules have been introduced in other countries? But he predicted that new restrictions could see these figure increase to two-thirds of premises and half of staff. ""To have more restrictions would really be a disaster, not only for pubs and bars but for the whole hospitality industry,"" he said. The Federation of Small Businesses said days of uncertainty about what new measures would be imposed had been ""unhelpful"" and had caused more emotional strain for employers and staff. It called on the Scottish government to outline what new support it would be offering to firms impacted by the restrictions, and warned not doing so would further erode the trust of the business community. The Scottish Conservatives have also called on the Scottish government to offer more than ""empty words"" to businesses, and said it was time for it to ""stop passing the buck back to the UK government"".
