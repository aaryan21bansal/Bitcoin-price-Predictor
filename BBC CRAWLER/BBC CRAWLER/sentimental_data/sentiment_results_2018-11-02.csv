"Drilling started at the Lancashire site on 15 October Shale gas has flowed for the first time at the UK's only fracking site currently in operation, energy firm Cuadrilla says. Operations began at the Lancashire site in October for the first time since 2011 when it was suspended because of earth tremors. There have been suspensions of the renewed underground drilling operations after further tremors in the area. Cuadrilla says the site may provide ""a significant source"" of gas. But local MP Rosie Cooper has said fracking at the site should be banned immediately, following a 1.1 magnitude tremor on Monday - the strongest since work began on 15 October. Since then, theshare price in Cuadrilla's parent company AJ Lucas has fallen,external. According to the British Geological Survey, earthquakes with a magnitude of less than two are not usually felt and, if they are, it is only by people very close to the epicentre. Hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, is a technique to extract gas and oil from the earth Liquid is pumped underground at high pressure to fracture shale rock and release gas or oil within Applications have also been submitted by various firms in Yorkshire, Nottinghamshire and for a second site in Lancashire The Department for Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy says shale gas ""has the potential to be a new domestic energy source"" Governments in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have said they will oppose fracking until further research is completed into its environmental impact Anti-fracking campaigners, who argue it poses environmental risks, had unsuccessfully tried to stop the process with an injunction bid. John Sauven, executive director of Greenpeace UK, criticised the fracking industry, saying it had ""produced a deep hole in a muddy field with a small amount of very expensive gas at the bottom"". ""It is truly bewildering how little fossil fuel companies need to offer in order to get whole-hearted, full-throated government support,"" he added. Call to ditch 'bonkers' fracking plan Fracking halted by largest tremor at site MP calls for fracking stop after tremors A Cuadrilla spokeswoman said the natural gas had flowed to the surface at the site near Preston New Road, Little Plumpton. The firm said it would spend at least three months operating two horizontal exploratory wells before testing the commercial viability of the gas flow. An aerial image shows the gas flare at the well Cuadrilla chief executive Francis Egan said the volumes were ""small"" but ""a good early indication of the gas potential that we have long talked about"". ""However, it provides early encouragement that the Bowland Shale can provide a significant source of natural gas to heat Lancashire and UK homes and offices and reduce our ever growing reliance on expensive foreign imports,"" he said. Lee Petts, chair of pro-fracking lobbyists Lancashire for Shale, said: ""We think it would be better if some of the Â£2.6 billion a year spent on importing liquefied natural gas was used to buy gas produced onshore here in Lancashire instead, supporting local industry, boosting employment and raising new taxes to spend on public priorities."" A 2.3 magnitude tremor on the Fylde coast in 2011 was probably caused by shale gas test drilling, a study found.

"Gianni Infantino became Fifa president in 2016 Top European clubs have held secret talks to create a European Super League, according toa report by German publication Der Spiegel.,external The newspaper claims leaked documents show the breakaway league could be created in 2021 and see clubs involved leave their national leagues and football associations. Der Spiegel also alleges separate documents show Manchester City and Paris St-Germain avoided financial fair play sanctions with the intervention of Fifa president Gianni Infantino. Premier League champions City said they would not comment ""on out of context materials purportedly hacked or stolen"". Der Spiegel says its source is a whistleblower they call John, who claims that neither he nor his associates are hackers. ""We have very good sources and a strong network that provides us with a lot of information,"" he told Der Spiegel. Der Spiegel claims Real Madrid has joined forces with AC Milan, Arsenal, Barcelona, Bayern Munich, Juventus and Manchester United to form a group of seven sides who went behind the back of Uefa, European football's governing body, to discuss forming a European Super League. As part of their plans, the clubs allegedly discussed ""an option for leaving the national leagues and their football associations behind entirely"". Bayern Munich are supposed to have explored the legal complexities of the breakaway and one of the documents Der Spiegel says it has seen is a ""binding term sheet"" which 16 clubs would sign to form the Super League. The new competition, it is claimed, would involve 11 of Europe's biggest clubs, known as the ""founders"", along with five ""initial guests"". The so-called founders, who would include the seven clubs named above along with Chelsea, Liverpool, Manchester City and Paris St-Germain, would not face relegation and would be guaranteed membership for 20 years. Der Spiegel reports that the five ""initial guests,"" according to the document, would be Atletico Madrid, Borussia Dortmund, Inter Milan, Marseille and Roma. A Bayern Munich statement said they were ""unaware of recent plans for a so-called Super League"" and had not ""taken part in negotiations relating to such plans"". The club's chairman added: ""FC Bayern Munich stands by its membership of the Bundesliga and, as long as I am chairman of the board of FC Bayern, also by the club competitions organised jointly by Uefa and the ECA (European Club Association)."" United declined to comment, while Arsenal, AC Milan, Juventus and Real Madrid have been contacted for their response by BBC Sport. Manchester City are owned by Sheikh Mansour Bin Zayed Al Nahyan's Abu Dhabi United Group, while PSG are owned by Qatar Sports Investment. According to Der Spiegel's report,,externalthey overvalued sponsorship deals to help meet FFP rules and, when facing sanctions over the matter, the allegations in the documents state Infantino helped arrange more lenient punishments for them in 2014. At the time, Fifa president Infantino was in his previous role as Uefa general secretary andCity and PSG were both finedÂ£49m, Â£32m of which was suspended. Following the latest claims, City's statement added: ""The attempt to damage the club's reputation is organized and clear."" A PSG statement said it ""has always acted in full compliance with the laws and regulations enacted by sports institutions"" and it ""denies the allegations"". The club added: ""Since the introduction of Financial Fair Play, Paris St-Germain have been one of the most audited and scrutinised clubs in history."" Uefa's response detailed the aims of FFP and added that the system ""is a comparatively recent system of regulation"" and with ""the early cases"" took ""Uefa and the clubs into unchartered territory"". It said: ""Uefa is confident that any apparent inconsistencies that may seem evident to some, have been eliminated as the system has developed and become more familiar to all sides."" Infantino became president of Fifa, world football's governing body, in 2016. ""All decisions on Uefa Financial Fair Play cases are made by the Uefa Club Financial Control Body (CFCB),"" said a Fifa statement. ""It is an independent body. ""The Uefa administration, which of course includes the general secretary, can assist the CFCB depending on the specific case. ""This may include discussions, meetings, assistance to help find solutions, and other interactions to assist the CFCB in its work. Nonetheless, the CFCB is entirely responsible for their own decisions."" In an interview last week, Infantino spoke in general terms when he said: ""My job entails having discussions, having conversations, exchanging documents, drafts, ideas, whatever, on many, many, many, many, topics. ""Otherwise you don't go anywhere. I mean, if I just have to stay in my room and not speak to anyone and cannot do anything, how can I do my job properly? ""So if then this is being portrayed as something bad, I think there's not much I can do more than my job in an honest way, in a professional way and trying to defend the interests of football."" Der Spiegel says the source of the documents they have obtained is a whistleblower called John, which is not his real name, who founded Football Leaks. Up to 70 million documents have been provided by Football Leaks and more than 3.4 terabytes of information. Der Spiegel has shared the information with other media outlets in the European Investigative Collaborations (EIC) consortium, which includes Reuters news agency, the Sunday Times and Spain's El Mundo. Together, about 80 journalists from 15 media outlets looked at the information provided.

"At least 16 MPs have received free sports tickets from betting companies since the 2017 general election. A BBC analysis ofparliament's register of MPs' interests,externalhas revealed that 13% of the Â£175,580 worth of sports tickets accepted by MPs came from betting companies, including William Hill and Ladbrokes. The analysis comes after Tracey Crouchresigned as sports ministerand appeared to criticise politicians who have links to the betting industry. Inher letter,externalto Theresa May on Thursday evening, Ms Crouch complained that the reduction in the maximum stake for fixed odds betting terminals (FOBTs) was ""being delayed until October 2019 due to commitments made by others to those with registered interests."" Of the 16 MPs, nine were Labour MPs, six Conservative and one SNP. Philip Davies, Conservative MP for Shipley, received free tickets worth a total of Â£5,759 since the general election. He was hosted at 13 horse racing events by Ladbrokes Coral, William Hill and Sky Bet, which also offered him free tickets to the 2017 League One play-off between Millwall and Bradford City. Mr Davies, a backbench MP, chairs the all-party parliamentary group (APPG) on betting and gambling. He has spoken out against restricting FOBTs numerous times in Parliament. For example, in March 2016,he said,external: ""The inconvenient truth is that problem gambling rates have reduced since the introduction of fixed odds betting terminals."" Andin November,externalof the same year: ""Can the Minister tell us what the point is of reducing the stakes on fixed-odds betting terminals in betting shops when people can go straight on to the internet and play exactly the same games with unlimited stakes?"" The BBC approached Mr Davies for comment but, so far, hasn't received a response. Speaking to the Times, he denied using his links to encourage the government to change its position: ""I'm flattered anyone thinks I could be so influential"", he said. Sports minister Tracey Crouch resigns Betting machine odds to be cut to Â£2 MPs sign up for Â£2m of free oversees trips The second most common guest of betting companies was Conservative MP Laurence Robertson, who received the hospitality of William Hill and Ladbrokes at a cost of Â£5,175 since the election. On Thursday, during an urgent question tabled by Shadow Culture Secretary Tom Watson, he criticised the focus on FOBTs, drawing attention to the ""losses that will be suffered on the high street in terms of the jobs of men, women and young people, who will also suffer poverty, and the losses to the horse racing industry."" Mr Robertson has links to the horse racing industry and, when contacted by the BBC, he said ""it would be odd if I didn't visit racecourses in various capacities."" That's because - he pointed out - his constituency of Tewkesbury includes the Cheltenham racecourse and he has been a co-chair of the APPG on racing and bloodstock for 8 years. Mr Robertson has previously defended the industry in parliament. During a Westminster Hall debate on 26 April 2016, he said: ""There are people with addictive natures who will be addicted to something, whether that is alcohol, drugs or gambling, but we are discussing only one form of gambling, and many other forms are available."" Some Conservative MPs have highlighted a series of donations made to Tom Watson by millionaire former poker player Derek Webb, who founded the anti-FOBT Campaign for Fairer Gambling. Mr Watson told the Daily Mail he had been highlighting the issue before he met Mr Webb and was proud to campaign alongside him. Within Labour's ranks, Tonia Antoniazzi topped the list. The MP for Gower received tickets and hospitality worth Â£1,693 from betting firms - including for boxing and darts. Ms Antoniazzi told the BBC that the darts tickets were to play in a parliamentary charity darts competition. She added that she has been ""a constant supporter of reducing the stake of fixed odds betting terminals."" The BBC's analysis does not cover events attended by government ministers in their official capacity. Out of 235 free sports events attended by MPs since the general election, two of the top three most common donors are betting companies: William Hill totalled 24 gifts at a value of Â£13,273 and Ladbrokes Coral Group hosted 14. Gary Gillies, frombonuscode.co.uk,external, said: ""Leading bookmakers are known to offer such freebies and promotional offers to lure high earners into the gambling circle."" A spokesperson for William Hill said: ""As a business that has sport at its core, and is a major sponsor of sports events including horse racing, we do invite MPs of all parties and views to find out more about the industry.""

"Scientists in the US have recruited an unlikely ally in their efforts to develop a new flu treatment. Llamas have been used to produce a new antibody therapy that has the potential to work against all types of flu, including new pandemics. Influenza is the ultimate shape-shifter, constantly mutating its appearance to evade our immune system. That is why a new flu jab is needed each winter and why the vaccine sometimes misses the mark. Science is on the hunt for a way to kill all types of flu, no matter the strain or how much it mutates. That's where the llama, better known for its wool, comes in. The animals produce incredibly tiny antibodies in comparison to our own. Antibodies are weapons of the immune system and they bind to the proteins that stick out from the surface of a virus. Human antibodies tend to attack the tips of those proteins, but that's the part influenza mutates most readily. Llama antibodies use their size advantage to wriggle a little bit deeper and attack the parts that flu cannot change. The team at the Scripps Institute in California infected llamas with multiple types of flu to provoke an immune response. They then scoured llama blood for the most potent antibodies that could attack a wide range of flu strains. They picked four, and then set about building their own synthetic antibody that used elements from each. It was tested on mice, which were given deadly doses of influenza. Prof Ian Wilson, one of the researchers, told theBBC's Science in Action: ""It's very effective, there were 60 different viruses that were used in the challenge and only one wasn't neutralised and that's a virus that doesn't infect humans. ""The goal here is to provide something that would work from season to season, and also protect you from possible pandemics should they emerge."" The work,published in the journal Science,external, is very early stage research and the team want to do more tests before starting human trials. The researchers tried two approaches to giving the animals the antibody. The first was to inject them with the antibodies, and the second was a type of gene therapy. The genetic instructions for making the antibody were packaged up inside a harmless virus, which was then used to infect the noses of mice. The cells in the linings of the nose then started making the flu-killing antibody. An additional advantage of this approach is that it could work in the elderly. The older you are the worse your immune system gets, and the less effective the seasonal flu vaccine becomes. But the llama-inspired approach does not need to train the immune system. Prof Jonathan Ball, from the University of Nottingham, told the BBC: ""Having a treatment that can work across a range of different strains of virus is highly sought after. It's the Holy Grail of influenza. ""There will be an appetite, but it depends how well these things work, how easy it is to produce and also how costly it will be.""

"The Brexit secretary expects to be able to answer MPs' questions on Brexit on 21 November The Brexit Secretary has pledged that the government will not sign up to any deal which could threaten the UK's constitutional integrity. Dominic Raab made the comments after a one-day visit to Northern Ireland. He met with businesses in Warrenpoint and Larne, and he also met with politicians at Stormont. Asked three times if the government had ruled out any new regulatory checks at the Irish Sea ports, he said: ""We are engaged in a negotiation process."" What's the latest on the UK-EU Brexit deal talks? Q&A: The Irish border Brexit backstop The hardest border He added that he was not going to engage in a running commentary but said the UK position was ""we want to preserve the internal market within the United Kingdom"". This video can not be played Brexit deal will not jeopardise UK integrity DUP leader Arlene Foster said she made it clear to Mr Raab it is important that ""as well as not having as customs barriers, we cannot have any regulatory barriers"" between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK. When asked by BBC News NI if Mr Raab gave that assurance, Mrs Foster said it is ""an ongoing process"". Following her meeting with Mr Raab, Sinn FÃ©in president Mary Lou McDonald accused the government of acting ""in bad faith"" over Brexit and warned the border issue is not a ""footnote"". The DUP also met with Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab in Stormont She added that the government has ""stepped back"" from its commitment to uphold the Good Friday Agreement. The Northern Ireland ""backstop"" remains the major unresolved issuein negotiations. Ms McDonald added that the Sinn FÃ©in meeting with the Brexit secretary was ""direct"". Sinn FÃ©in President Mary Lou McDonald warned Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab that the border issue with Ireland is not a ""footnote"" Earlier, Mr Raab was accused of behaving ""like a thief in the night"" on his visit to Northern Ireland. He met politicians and business leaders and visited Warrenpoint Port in County Down and Larne Harbour in County Antrim. However, Sinn FÃ©in South Down MP Chris Hazzard protested that the Brexit secretary had refused to meet local politicians. Chris Hazzard said the Brexit negotiations were ""an absolute shambles"" Speaking outside Warrenpoint Port, Mr Hazzard said it was an example of ""the cynicism and disrespect"" being shown to the electorate of South Down and that Mr Raab had come in ""like a thief in the night"" without listening to people and their concerns about leaving the EU. SDLP MLA SinÃ©ad Bradley said it was ""an absolute disgrace"" that Mr Raab had not found time to meet local politicians. ""I suspect he did not want to hear the voice of the people of the area,"" she said. SinÃ©ad Bradley said she thought Mr Raab did not want to hear the voice of local people The Northern Ireland ""backstop"" remains the major unresolved issuein current withdrawal negotiations. Colm Shannon of Newry Chamber of Commerce described Mr Raab's visit to Warrenpoint as ""a welcome opportunity for local businesses to highlight our concerns about the border and future trading relationships with the EU"". ""It was a useful visit. He listened to the concerns of local businesses, particularly those that trade north-south,"" he said. He said an open border and freedom to trade east and west were essential to the continued success of the port. The backstop is an arrangement which will apply if the Irish border cannot be kept as frictionless as it is now in the context of a wider deal. Allow Twitter content?

The EU and UK have agreed the need for a backstop, but not how it should operate. The EU has proposed a backstop that would mean Northern Ireland staying in the EU customs union, large parts of the single market and the EU VAT system. The UK government has rejected it as a threat to the integrity of the UK and has suggested a backstop that would see the UK as a whole remaining aligned with the EU customs union for a limited period. A letter from Mr Raab, published earlier this week, suggested he expects a deal on the UK's exit from the EU to be agreed within three weeks. The Brexit secretary told a committee of MPs he was happy to appear before them to give evidence ""when a deal is finalised"" and ""currently expected 21 November to be suitable"". However, Mr Raab's own department later clarified that there was ""no set date for the negotiations to conclude"". November 21 was the date offered by the committee's chairman, it added. Meanwhile, Ireland's foreign minister has said it is up to the UK to ""intensify"" talks. Simon Coveney, who met Mr Raab on Tuesday evening, said time was short and while an overall deal was possible within three weeks, it had to take shape soon. Mr Coveney and Irish Justice Minister Charlie Flanagan hosted a meeting in Dublin on Friday for the latest session of the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference (BIIGC). It wasthe second time in about three months the conferencewas held, after not being convened for more than a decade. The British government was represented by Northern Ireland Secretary Karen Bradley and Cabinet Office Minister David Lidington.

"President Trump began reinstating sanctions on Iran in May The Trump administration is to reinstate all US sanctions on Iran removed under the 2015 nuclear deal. The White House said it was ""the toughest sanctions regime ever imposed"" on Tehran. It targets both Iran and states that trade with it. However, temporary waivers will be granted to eight countries to allow them to continue importing Iranian oil. Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said the move ""disgraced"" US prestige and liberal democracy. ""The challenge between the US and Iran has lasted for 40 years so far and the US has made various efforts against us: military, economic and media warfare,"" Mr Khamenei wrote on Twitter on Saturday. ""This new US president has disgraced the remnant of America's prestige,"" he said, adding that ""America today is far weaker"", suggesting that US military power was beginning to ""wane and deteriorate"". Can the Iran nuclear deal survive? The impact of Iran sanctions - in charts Washington is to reintroduce the sanctions on Monday 5 November. Meanwhile, EU states that backed the nuclear deal have said they will protect EU firms doing ""legitimate"" business with Iran. President Donald Trump withdrew from the agreement in May, describing it as ""defective at its core"" because it had not stopped Iran developing a ballistic missile programme and intervening in neighbouring countries. ""Sanctions are coming,"" he tweeted after Friday's announcement, referencing the TV series Game of Thrones and its motto ""Winter is coming"". Allow Twitter content?

The US has been gradually re-imposing sanctions, but analysts say this move is the most important because it targets the core sectors of Iran's economy. What nappies tell us about Iran's economic woes Iran nuclear deal: Key details The agreement saw Iran limit its controversial nuclear activities in exchange for sanctions relief. Barack Obama, the US president at the time, had argued the deal would prevent Iran from developing nuclear arms. The UK, France, Germany, Russia and China were also parties to the 2015 accord and have stuck to it, saying Iran is complying. The US sanctions will cover shipping, shipbuilding, finance and energy. Iran's oil industry faces new restrictions More than 700 individuals, entities, vessels and aircraft will be put on the sanctions list, including major banks, oil exporters and shipping companies. US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin also said that the Brussels-based Swift network for making international payments was expected to cut off links with targeted Iranian institutions. Being disconnected from Swift would almost completely isolate Iran from the international financial system. They are the second lot of sanctions re-imposed by Mr Trump since May. US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo set out 12 demands that Iran must meet if sanctions are to be lifted - including ending support for militants and completely ballistic missile development. Mr Pompeo did not name the eight countries that been granted waivers to continue importing Iranian oil. He said the eight had ""demonstrated significant reductions in their crude oil and co-operation on many other fronts"". Two would eventually stop imports and the other six greatly reduce them, he added. US allies such as Italy, India, Japan and South Korea are among the eight,external, the Associated Press news agency reports. Turkey also obtained a waiver, Reuters says. All have been have been top importers of Iranian oil. Foreign ministry spokesman Bahram Qasemi told state TV that Iran had ""the knowledge and the capability to manage the country's economic affairs"". He said there was ""no possibility"" that the US ""will attain its political goals through such sanctions"". In a joint statement,the foreign ministers of the UK, Germany and France, and EU foreign affairs chief Federica Mogherini said they ""deeply"" regretted the US decision,externalto restore sanctions. ""We are determined to protect European economic operators engaged in legitimate business with Iran, in accordance with EU law and with UN Security Council resolution 2231,"" they said. By Barbara Plett Usher, BBC News, Washington Over the past six months the Trump administration has pushed a goal of getting Iranian oil exports as close to zero as possible. But the balance between supply and demand in the oil market is fairly tight, so it has to calibrate accordingly. It does not want to drive all the Iranian oil off the market on 5 November because that could spike prices. This would benefit Iran, and anger Americans at the petrol pumps. The US has increased its own production to fill in the gap left by Iran's oil and urged others to as well, especially Saudi Arabia. It has also granted permission to eight countries to continue imports of Iranian oil after intense lobbying by some of them. Officials haven't said which ones yet, but the list is expected to include India and possibly China, two of Iran's biggest customers. But this is at reduced levels and only for six months, at which point the administration will reassess the oil markets. And the money from these sales will go into an escrow account to be used for permitted goods and services, so Iran won't get the cash. Results so far show what the US can achieve with the big stick of its enormous economic power. But isolating Iran through force alone, absent the united political front of its previous partners, will continue to require a balancing act.

"This video can not be played How has the death of Jamal Khashoggi impacted the war in Yemen? Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has for the first time accused the Saudi government directly of murdering journalist Jamal Khashoggi. ""We know that the order to kill Khashoggi came from the highest levels of the Saudi government,"" he wrote in an article in the Washington Post. But stressing Turkey's ""friendly"" ties with Saudi Arabia,he added that he did not believe King Salman was involved,external. Khashoggi was murdered at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on 2 October. Is the Saudi crown prince finished? The Jamal Khashoggi story so far Who is the journalist that disappeared? Jamal Khashoggi in his own words Turkish investigators believe the journalist, who was living in exile, was strangled when he visited to collect documents for his forthcoming marriage to a Turkish citizen. Questions persist about what went on behind the door of the Saudi consulate on 2 October His body has not been found andan aide to President Erdogan, Yasin Aktay, has said he believes it was dissolved in acid after being cut up. The murder, initially covered up by Saudi officials, caused a diplomatic crisis between Saudi Arabia and its allies. The Saudis have since arrested 18 suspectswho, they say, will be prosecuted in Saudi Arabia. Turkey wants them extradited. A memorial service marking four weeks since the journalist's death has been held in Washington. ""We know that the perpetrators are among the 18 suspects detained in Saudi Arabia,"" he wrote in the Washington Post, where Khashoggi had written a column. ""We also know that those individuals came to carry out their orders: Kill Khashoggi and leave. Finally, we know that the order to kill Khashoggi came from the highest levels of the Saudi government."" Writing that the murder had involved a ""lot more than a group of security officials"", President Erdogan called for ""the puppet masters behind Khashoggi's killing"" to be exposed. This video can not be played Jamal Khashoggi's fiancee: ""We didn't say any goodbyes"" ""No one should dare to commit such acts on the soil of a Nato ally again,"" he said. ""If anyone chooses to ignore that warning, they will face severe consequences."" He complained that no action had been taken against the Saudi consul general, who has left Turkey, and accused the Saudi public prosecutor of failing to co-operate with the investigation ""and answer even simple questions"". The Saudis have admitted Khashoggi died at the consulate, while denying they know what happened to his body. A Turkish prosecutor said earlier this week that investigators believe the journalist was immediately strangled on entering the consulate, in a murder planned in advance. His body was then dismembered and destroyed ""again, in line with advance plans"", prosecutor Irfan Fidan said. Once an adviser to the Saudi royal family, Khashoggi fell out of favour with the government last year and went into self-imposed exile. Amnesty International activists put up a fake sign reading ""Khashoggi Street"" outside the Saudi embassy in London He had become a sharp critic of the Saudi government and of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who has been pioneering an ambitious economic and social reform programme in the country. Speaking at the memorial service in Washington, Daniel Balson from Amnesty International said the Saudi government needed to be held to account over the journalist's death. ""For too long, they've operated under the impression that impunity is for them and that the rules are for others,"" he said. ""They believe that a government critic can disappear in their diplomatic mission and that those who care about justice will not notice or if they notice they will not object or if they object, they will not remember. Well we've noticed and we're outraged and we will not forget."" Khashoggi's fiancee on writer's death.

"Actors Kit Harrington and John Bradley in international TV hit series Game of Thrones The term 'sanctions' will turn off all but the most devoted current affairs nerds. But add a Game Of Thrones meme, and BAM!, it's social-media friendly. The White House did just that on Friday when a picture referencing the hit TV series was posted on President Donald Trump's social media accounts. ""Sanctions are coming,"" it said. It came after the administration announced it is to reinstate all US sanctions on Iran removed under the 2015 nuclear deal. HBO, the US network that produced Game of Thrones, was unimpressed, saying: ""We were not aware of this messaging and would prefer our trademark not be misappropriated for political purposes.""

"The 49 items of jewellery were seized by officers on Tuesday as part of a continuing investigation More than Â£400,000 of jewellery from the world-famous Christies auction house has been seized by the National Crime Agency, as part of a major investigation into a woman who spent Â£16m in Harrods. The 49 items of jewellery were seized on Tuesday by officers investigating the woman and her husband - who are the first targets of a new power looking into unexplained wealth invested in the UK. Last month, the BBC won a legal battle to name Zamira Hajiyeva, from Azerbaijan, who has been ordered by the courts to explain how she could afford Â£22m worth of property in the UK. That property comprised a large home near Harrods, along with two bays in the store's private car park, and a Berkshire golf course. Mrs Hajiyeva also spent Â£16m in the luxury goods department store over a decade - some of which went on high value jewellery. Her husband, Jahangir Hajiyev, is in jail in Azerbaijan after being convicted of defrauding the state bank he once ran of millions of pounds. Zamira Hajiyeva: Centre of National Crime Agency unexplained wealth investigation On Thursday morning a judge ruled that the NCA could hold the jewellery taken from Christies for six months, as part of its continuing investigation into the family's wealth. In a statement, the NCA said that Christies had been valuing the items for Mrs Hajiyeva's daughter, Leyla Mahmudova. ""It is the view of the NCA that the source of the funds to purchase the jewellery requires further investigation,"" said the statement. ""Christie's auction house co-operated with the investigation, complying with a formal request for information,"" said the NCA statement. Woman who spent Â£16m in Harrods revealed Harrods big spender fights to keep mansion The most expensive item seized is a Boucheron sapphire and ruby necklace worth up to Â£120,000. While an earlier court hearing into Mrs Hajiyeva's wealth revealed she had bought that brand of jewellery from Harrods, it's not clear whether this particular item was part of her shopping spree. Another of the items, a Van Cleef and Arpels pearl necklace valued at Â£20,000, is said to have been bought by the jailed banker in 2008 in St Moritz, Switzerland. Other items seized include a Cartier ""Panthere"" pendant worth up to Â£9,000 and a Â£4,000 diamond cluster and bar necklace. Unexplained Wealth Orders are a new power to combat suspected international corruption. The court orders target individuals and families, linked to foreign governments, who have invested in property in the UK with no clear source for their wealth. Under the terms of her UWO, Mrs Hajiyeva must explain to investigators how she and her husband became rich enough to buy their London property, or face a second court order to seize the property. Up to nine more UWO cases are in the pipeline, with targets including former officials linked to Russia and corrupt regimes in Africa. In a previous statement, lawyers for Mrs Hajiyeva said she would co-operate with the court process and had not been found guilty of a criminal offence. In court, they had argued that her husband was not a corrupt official - he had made his money legitimately and was the victim of an injustice. The BBC has contacted Christie's for comment. Duncan Hames, of the anti-corruption campaign group Transparency International, who lobbied for the introduction of UWOs, said the NCA's latest move revealed the scale of the task it faced - and urged businesses to report suspicious transactions. ""This really goes to show quite what a range of businesses can be potentially be exposed to allegedly illicit assets,"" he said. ""We often hear about  estate agents and banks, but anyone involved in the sale of high value goods, luxury cars, even private education, face the same risks.""

Up to nine more UWO cases are in the pipeline, with targets including former officials linked to Russia and corrupt regimes in Africa. In a previous statement, lawyers for Mrs Hajiyeva said she would co-operate with the court process and had not been found guilty of a criminal offence.

"The Brexit secretary expects to be able to answer MPs' questions on Brexit on 21 November The Brexit Secretary has pledged that the government will not sign up to any deal which could threaten the UK's constitutional integrity. Dominic Raab made the comments after a one-day visit to Northern Ireland. He met with businesses in Warrenpoint and Larne, and he also met with politicians at Stormont.

The EU and UK have agreed the need for a backstop, but not how it should operate. The EU has proposed a backstop that would mean Northern Ireland staying in the EU customs union, large parts of the single market and the EU VAT system. The UK government has rejected it as a threat to the integrity of the UK and has suggested a backstop that would see the UK as a whole remaining aligned with the EU customs union for a limited period. A letter from Mr Raab, published earlier this week, suggested he expects a deal on the UK's exit from the EU to be agreed within three weeks. The Brexit secretary told a committee of MPs he was happy to appear before them to give evidence ""when a deal is finalised"" and ""currently expected 21 November to be suitable"". However, Mr Raab's own department later clarified that there was ""no set date for the negotiations to conclude"". November 21 was the date offered by the committee's chairman, it added.

"The 49 items of jewellery were seized by officers on Tuesday as part of a continuing investigation More than Â£400,000 of jewellery from the world-famous Christies auction house has been seized by the National Crime Agency, as part of a major investigation into a woman who spent Â£16m in Harrods. The 49 items of jewellery were seized on Tuesday by officers investigating the woman and her husband - who are the first targets of a new power looking into unexplained wealth invested in the UK. Last month, the BBC won a legal battle to name Zamira Hajiyeva, from Azerbaijan, who has been ordered by the courts to explain how she could afford Â£22m worth of property in the UK. That property comprised a large home near Harrods, along with two bays in the store's private car park, and a Berkshire golf course. Mrs Hajiyeva also spent Â£16m in the luxury goods department store over a decade - some of which went on high value jewellery. Her husband, Jahangir Hajiyev, is in jail in Azerbaijan after being convicted of defrauding the state bank he once ran of millions of pounds. Zamira Hajiyeva: Centre of National Crime Agency unexplained wealth investigation On Thursday morning a judge ruled that the NCA could hold the jewellery taken from Christies for six months, as part of its continuing investigation into the family's wealth. In a statement, the NCA said that Christies had been valuing the items for Mrs Hajiyeva's daughter, Leyla Mahmudova. ""It is the view of the NCA that the source of the funds to purchase the jewellery requires further investigation,"" said the statement. ""Christie's auction house co-operated with the investigation, complying with a formal request for information,"" said the NCA statement. Woman who spent Â£16m in Harrods revealed Harrods big spender fights to keep mansion The most expensive item seized is a Boucheron sapphire and ruby necklace worth up to Â£120,000. While an earlier court hearing into Mrs Hajiyeva's wealth revealed she had bought that brand of jewellery from Harrods, it's not clear whether this particular item was part of her shopping spree. Another of the items, a Van Cleef and Arpels pearl necklace valued at Â£20,000, is said to have been bought by the jailed banker in 2008 in St Moritz, Switzerland. Other items seized include a Cartier ""Panthere"" pendant worth up to Â£9,000 and a Â£4,000 diamond cluster and bar necklace. Unexplained Wealth Orders are a new power to combat suspected international corruption. The court orders target individuals and families, linked to foreign governments, who have invested in property in the UK with no clear source for their wealth. Under the terms of her UWO, Mrs Hajiyeva must explain to investigators how she and her husband became rich enough to buy their London property, or face a second court order to seize the property.

"This video can not be played How has the death of Jamal Khashoggi impacted the war in Yemen? A top Turkish official, presidential adviser Yasin Aktay, has said he believes Jamal Khashoggi's body was dissolved in acid after being cut up. The ""only logical conclusion"", he said, was that those who had killed the Saudi journalist in Istanbul had destroyed his body ""to leave no trace behind"". Khashoggi, a critic of Saudi rulers, was killed inside the country's consulate on 2 October. No forensic evidence has been provided to prove his body was dissolved. ""The reason they dismembered Khashoggi's body was to dissolve his remains more easily"", Mr Aktay told the Hurriyet Daily newspaper. ""Now we see that they did not only dismember his body but also vaporised it."" The claims came as Khashoggi's fiancÃ©e, Hatice Cengiz, called on world leaders to ""bring the perpetrators to justice"", inan editorial for five newspapers,external, including the Guardian and the Washington Post. Meanwhile, reports quote Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman as telling the US he considered Khashoggi to be a dangerous Islamist. The reported phone call to the White House came before Saudi Arabia admitted Khashoggi had been killed. Saudi Arabia has denied the comments were made or that its royal family was involved in the killing, and says it is ""determined to find out all the facts"". Istanbul's prosecutor confirmed on Wednesday that the writer had been strangled. Is Saudi crown prince finished? The Jamal Khashoggi story so far Who is the journalist that disappeared? Jamal Khashoggi in his own words During the call with President Donald Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner and national security adviser John Bolton,Prince Mohammed said Khashoggi had been a member of the Muslim Brotherhood,external, a transnational Islamist organisation, the Washington Post reports. The phone call is reported to have taken place on 9 October, a week after Khashoggi disappeared. Prince Mohammed also reportedly urged the White House to preserve the US-Saudi alliance. Prince Mohammed urged the White House to preserve the US-Saudi alliance In a statement to the newspaper, Khashoggi's family denied he had been a member of the Muslim Brotherhood and said the murdered writer had himself denied this repeatedly in recent years. ""Jamal Khashoggi was not a dangerous person in any way possible. To claim otherwise would be ridiculous,"" the statement said. There is still no consensus on how Khashoggi died. He entered the consulate to sort out documents for his marriage. This video can not be played Jamal Khashoggi's fiancee: ""We didn't say any goodbyes"" But on WednesdayTurkey said he had been strangled immediately after entering the consulateand his body dismembered ""in accordance with plans made in advance"". Turkish media had previously quoted sources as saying Turkey had audio recordings proving that Khashoggi had been tortured before being murdered. Saudi Arabia has changed its account of what happened to Khashoggi. When he first disappeared, it said Khashoggi had walked out of the building alive. It later admitted he had been murdered, saying the killing was premeditated and a result of a ""rogue operation"". It has arrested 18 suspectswho, it says, will be prosecuted in Saudi Arabia. Turkey wants the suspects to be extradited. This video can not be played Jamal Khashoggi: What we know about the journalist's disappearance and death Turkey has steered away from publicly blaming Saudi Arabia for the killing. President Recep Tayyip Erdogan spoke to Saudi King Salman last week, and the two agreed to continue co-operating in the investigation. Saudi Arabia has faced a backlash over the death, including from its allies, who have called for answers. President Trump has said he is ""not satisfied"" with the Saudi account. However, he also said he was unwilling to sacrifice lucrative arms deals with the country. Although their US visas have been revoked, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said it would be a ""handful more weeks"" before the US knew enough to impose sanctions on individuals involved in Khashoggi's killing. Mr Pompeo said the US had ""deep and long-term strategic relationships"" with Saudi Arabia and said ""we intend to make sure that those relationships remain intact"". This video can not be played Why do Trump's Saudi job numbers keep growing? On Wednesday, France's Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian said Khashoggi's death was a ""crime"" and ""odious"". He said France was not ""dependent on our economic relations with Saudi Arabia"" and the country would impose sanctions, but no details were given. UK Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt also said it was an appalling act, adding thatit had ""possibly"" given the US and the UK a chance to put new pressure on Saudi Arabiaover other issues. Earlier,the US called for a swift cessation of hostilities in Yemen, where a Saudi-led coalition has been fighting rebels supported by its arch-enemy Iran. In an editorial published in five international newspapers, Ms Cengiz said Khashoggi had just bought a house and wished to start a family. She described the ""anguish"" she had experienced since his ""brutal, barbaric and ruthless"" death. ""We must all send a clear message that authoritarian regimes cannot kill journalists ever again."" She called on governments around the world to take action to reveal the truth, accusing the United States of taking a position ""devoid of moral foundation."" ""If the democracies of the world do not take genuine steps to bring to justice the perpetrators of this brazen, callous act - one that has caused universal outrage among their citizens - what moral authority are they left with?"" she asked.

"While 2018 saw an extremely hot summer in the UK, the previous decade was also warmer than the long-term average The UK has experienced more weather extremes over the last 10 years when compared with previous decades, a Met Office report has said. The hottest days have become almost 1C hotter, warm spells have increased, while the coldest days are not as cold. The number of so-called tropical nights - when temperatures stay above 20C - is increasing. The Met Office says these changes are consistent with warming driven by human activities. The new study compares UK weather data from the period 1961-1990 with the 10 years between 2008 and 2017. This video can not be played Why there were so many heatwaves around the world in 2018 2018 joint hottest summer for UK 2018 and 1976 - a tale of two heatwaves The study finds that on average the hottest day in each year over the recent 10-year period is 0.8C warmer than it was when compared to the earlier decades. The coldest days and nights have also become warmer, with temperatures on average 1.7C milder in recent years. To illustrate just how mild temperatures have been between 2008 and 2017, the report says that a significant area inland from the UK coast had, on average, less than one day per year with temperatures below zero. One intriguing finding has been about what are termed tropical nights, when temperatures stay above 20C. In the 30 years between1961 and 1990 there were no less than 44 nights where at least somewhere in the UK had a minimum temperature of 20C or higher. But in the 10 years between 2008 and 2017 there were 12 such nights. In 2018, there were five such nights, The Met Office expects to see more tropical nights as our climate continues to warm. These can be a big risk for elderly people. ""A particular concern for the health impacts of heat waves are these tropical nights where the human body doesn't get respite from the heat,"" said Dr Mark McCarthy from the Met Office's National Climate Information Centre. ""That is particularly so in large cities where it is further exacerbated by the urban heat island effect where the city will retain more of the heat of the day. ""Of those places where we do see tropical nights most frequently, London is one of those areas where it does occur.  It could become a very important index in future."" Another important measure of change that is highlighted in the study are the number of warm spells that have been recorded. This is the number of days per year that go well beyond the average long-term temperature for that 24-hour period. The study says that between 1961 and 1990 there were on average 5.3 days per year that went well beyond the average. In the 10 years to 2017, there were 13.2 days on average every year. Rainfall has also increased over the period of the report. The maximum five-day precipitation between 1916 and 1990 was 77.8mm - between 2008 and 2017, it averaged 81.4mm. Wildfires in various parts of the UK were a consequence of the hot summer of 2018 So what's been driving all this change? Met Office scientists say that natural variability may be impacting the rainfall situation across the UK - but when it comes to temperatures, the researchers say it is warming driven by humans. ""The temperature indicators are all consistent with the warming of the UK climate that we have observed over the last 50 years or so,"" said Dr McCarthy. ""Certainly for the temperature-based indices such as the warm spell duration and the cold and high temperature indices, they are consistent with that well known warming, and for the UK it's about the same rate of warming as has been seen globally.""

Influenza is the ultimate shape-shifter, constantly mutating its appearance to evade our immune system. That is why a new flu jab is needed each winter and why the vaccine sometimes misses the mark. Science is on the hunt for a way to kill all types of flu, no matter the strain or how much it mutates. That's where the llama, better known for its wool, comes in. The animals produce incredibly tiny antibodies in comparison to our own. Antibodies are weapons of the immune system and they bind to the proteins that stick out from the surface of a virus. Human antibodies tend to attack the tips of those proteins, but that's the part influenza mutates most readily. Llama antibodies use their size advantage to wriggle a little bit deeper and attack the parts that flu cannot change. The team at the Scripps Institute in California infected llamas with multiple types of flu to provoke an immune response. They then scoured llama blood for the most potent antibodies that could attack a wide range of flu strains. They picked four, and then set about building their own synthetic antibody that used elements from each. It was tested on mice, which were given deadly doses of influenza. Prof Ian Wilson, one of the researchers, told theBBC's Science in Action: ""It's very effective, there were 60 different viruses that were used in the challenge and only one wasn't neutralised and that's a virus that doesn't infect humans. ""The goal here is to provide something that would work from season to season, and also protect you from possible pandemics should they emerge."" The work,published in the journal Science,external, is very early stage research and the team want to do more tests before starting human trials. The researchers tried two approaches to giving the animals the antibody. The first was to inject them with the antibodies, and the second was a type of gene therapy. The genetic instructions for making the antibody were packaged up inside a harmless virus, which was then used to infect the noses of mice. The cells in the linings of the nose then started making the flu-killing antibody. An additional advantage of this approach is that it could work in the elderly. The older you are the worse your immune system gets, and the less effective the seasonal flu vaccine becomes. But the llama-inspired approach does not need to train the immune system. Prof Jonathan Ball, from the University of Nottingham, told the BBC: ""Having a treatment that can work across a range of different strains of virus is highly sought after. It's the Holy Grail of influenza. ""There will be an appetite, but it depends how well these things work, how easy it is to produce and also how costly it will be.""

"Mr Baldwin leaving the police station in New York US actor Alec Baldwin has been charged with assault in New York City after allegedly punching a man in a fight over a parking spot. He left a police station in the city after being ordered to appear in court on 26 November. This is not 60-year-old Mr Baldwin's first run-in with the law - in 2014, he was arrested for disorderly conduct. The actor starred in the movie Hunt for Red October and more recently in TV shows 30 Rock and Saturday Night Live. This video can not be played Alec Baldwin on playing Trump: 'I'm channelling people's frustration' The alleged altercation occurred in the West Village area of Manhattan on Friday. Police told US media the actor had claimed his family member had been holding a spot for his Cadillac Escalade SUV when a man driving a Saab station wagon swooped in and took it. Police say the two men were arguing and pushing each other before Mr Baldwin swung at the 49-year-old man, who was taken to hospital with jaw pain. After he was charged with misdemeanour assault and harassment, Mr Baldwin denied that he had hit anyone. ""The assertion that I punched anyone over a parking spot is false. I wanted to go on the record stating as much,"" he tweeted. Gaming Baldwin 'kicked off plane' Baldwin apology over phone rant,external US President Donald Trump, whom Mr Baldwin has portrayed on the comedy show Saturday Night Live, said when asked about the arrest: ""I wish him luck."" Mr Baldwin has made headlines before for his anger issues. New York police arrested him in May 2014 after he was caught riding his bicycle the wrong way in traffic and then became belligerent, swearing at the officers. He was given summonses for the bike violation as well as disorderly conduct. Mr Baldwin tweeted angrily about the incident, calling New York City ""a mismanaged carnival of stupidity"" and naming the officer who arrested him. In 2013, he was suspended from his MSNBC talk show Up Late for using an anti-gay slur when arguing with a photographer in New York City. Baldwin and his wife Hilaria attended the US Open together last September The actor later issued an apology,external, saying he ""did not intend to hurt or offend anyone"" with his word choice. Following the incident, his daughter Ireland also defended him on Twitter, saying that ""for someone who has battled with anger management issues, my dad has grown tremendously"". Mr Baldwin and his daughter have had a tense relationship in the past. He apologised publicly in 2007 for calling his then-11-year-old daughter a ""rude, thoughtless little pig"" in a voicemail after the message went viral online. In 2011, Mr Baldwin was kicked off a flight after refusing to turn off his phone. The actor said he was playing Words with Friends. In 1995 he was acquitted of misdemeanour battery charges for punching a photographer in self-defence.

"Maulana Sami ul-Haq was an influential figure in Pakistan The Pakistani cleric Maulana Sami ul-Haq, known as the Father of the Taliban, has been killed in the northern city of Rawalpindi. Local media quoted his family members as saying that he was stabbed to death. But other reports say he was shot dead. The motive for the attack is unclear. Haq was the head of the Haqqania madrassa in the north of Pakistan, where many Taliban members - including the group's founder, Mullah Omar - had studied. There are still conflicting reports of exactly how Haq was killed. The cleric's son said his father was stabbed ""multiple times"" in the house he owned in Rawalpindi. ""He was resting in his room during Asr time when his driver-cum-guard went out for 15 minutes,"" Maulana Hamid ul-Haq was quoted as saying by Pakistan's Geo TV. ""When he returned, he found Maulana Sami ul-Haq dead in his bed and his body covered in blood."" Meanwhile, Haq's nephew Mohammad Bilal told Reuters his uncle was found with stabbing and gunshot wounds in his house on Islamabad's outskirts. No group has so far claimed responsibility for Friday's attack.

"Fish fingers are surprisingly sustainable and some of the best products to buy are also the cheapest, the Marine Conservation Society says. Some 85% of the fish in 48 supermarket own-brand and branded fingers came from sustainable sources, its study found. The MCS's Rajina Gurung said it was an ""unexpected"" result, adding it was hard for shoppers to know the source of the fish at a glance due to poor labelling. Choosing sustainable products ""will help protect the ocean,"" she said. The top 15 sustainable fish fingers rated in the study were: Asda smart price fish fingers Asda omega-3 fish fingers Co-op omega-3 fish fingers Iceland breaded fish fingers Marks & Spencer gluten free cod fish fingers Morrisons omega-3 fish fingers Morrisons savers fish fingers Sainsbury's cod fillet fish fingers Sainsbury's ""deliciously free from"" cod fish fingers Sainsbury's basic fish fingers Sainsbury's omega-3 pollock fish fingers Tesco omega-3 fish fingers Waitrose essential cod fish fingers Waitrose 6 essential chunky cod fillet fish fingers in breadcrumbs Young's omega-3 fish fingers Rather than being a mix of unspecified fish, the study showed the 48 fish fingers contained four different species: Atlantic cod, Pacific cod, Alaska pollock and haddock. Ms Gurung, who compiled theGood Fish Finger Guide,external, said where and how seafood had been caught or farmed made a big difference to its sustainability, and these were factors MCS had considered. The stock status - or the population - of the species of fish is also important, she said. For example, there are 14 different cod stocks in the north-east Atlantic and ""some are doing better than others"". She added that fishing methods that had a low impact on the surrounding environment, such as handline fishing, were the most sustainable.

"While 2018 saw an extremely hot summer in the UK, the previous decade was also warmer than the long-term average The UK has experienced more weather extremes over the last 10 years when compared with previous decades, a Met Office report has said. The hottest days have become almost 1C hotter, warm spells have increased, while the coldest days are not as cold. The number of so-called tropical nights - when temperatures stay above 20C - is increasing. The Met Office says these changes are consistent with warming driven by human activities. The new study compares UK weather data from the period 1961-1990 with the 10 years between 2008 and 2017. This video can not be played Why there were so many heatwaves around the world in 2018 2018 joint hottest summer for UK 2018 and 1976 - a tale of two heatwaves The study finds that on average the hottest day in each year over the recent 10-year period is 0.8C warmer than it was when compared to the earlier decades. The coldest days and nights have also become warmer, with temperatures on average 1.7C milder in recent years. To illustrate just how mild temperatures have been between 2008 and 2017, the report says that a significant area inland from the UK coast had, on average, less than one day per year with temperatures below zero. One intriguing finding has been about what are termed tropical nights, when temperatures stay above 20C. In the 30 years between1961 and 1990 there were no less than 44 nights where at least somewhere in the UK had a minimum temperature of 20C or higher. But in the 10 years between 2008 and 2017 there were 12 such nights. In 2018, there were five such nights, The Met Office expects to see more tropical nights as our climate continues to warm. These can be a big risk for elderly people. ""A particular concern for the health impacts of heat waves are these tropical nights where the human body doesn't get respite from the heat,"" said Dr Mark McCarthy from the Met Office's National Climate Information Centre. ""That is particularly so in large cities where it is further exacerbated by the urban heat island effect where the city will retain more of the heat of the day. ""Of those places where we do see tropical nights most frequently, London is one of those areas where it does occur.  It could become a very important index in future."" Another important measure of change that is highlighted in the study are the number of warm spells that have been recorded. This is the number of days per year that go well beyond the average long-term temperature for that 24-hour period. The study says that between 1961 and 1990 there were on average 5.3 days per year that went well beyond the average. In the 10 years to 2017, there were 13.2 days on average every year. Rainfall has also increased over the period of the report. The maximum five-day precipitation between 1916 and 1990 was 77.8mm - between 2008 and 2017, it averaged 81.4mm. Wildfires in various parts of the UK were a consequence of the hot summer of 2018 So what's been driving all this change? Met Office scientists say that natural variability may be impacting the rainfall situation across the UK - but when it comes to temperatures, the researchers say it is warming driven by humans. ""The temperature indicators are all consistent with the warming of the UK climate that we have observed over the last 50 years or so,"" said Dr McCarthy. ""Certainly for the temperature-based indices such as the warm spell duration and the cold and high temperature indices, they are consistent with that well known warming, and for the UK it's about the same rate of warming as has been seen globally.""

"Parents have alleged a pupil attending Stoke High School is an adult possibly aged in his 30s A secondary school pupil is being investigated after parents and classmates claimed he was as old as 30. It is thought he is an asylum seeker who joined Stoke High School, Ipswich, as a new pupil at the start of term. The school said it had contacted the Home Office in relation to the concerns but it was not prepared to comment further. Another pupil shared an image on social media with the message: ""How's there a 30-year-old man in our maths class?"" But some classmates from the school said they did not think he was as old as 30 and suggested he had been a victim of bullying. The Home Office said it does not routinely comment on individual cases. In a statement the school said: ""This is a matter for the Home Office. They are looking into this after we contacted them.

"The Brexit secretary expects to be able to answer MPs' questions on Brexit on 21 November The Brexit Secretary has pledged that the government will not sign up to any deal which could threaten the UK's constitutional integrity. Dominic Raab made the comments after a one-day visit to Northern Ireland. He met with businesses in Warrenpoint and Larne, and he also met with politicians at Stormont. Asked three times if the government had ruled out any new regulatory checks at the Irish Sea ports, he said: ""We are engaged in a negotiation process."" What's the latest on the UK-EU Brexit deal talks? Q&A: The Irish border Brexit backstop The hardest border He added that he was not going to engage in a running commentary but said the UK position was ""we want to preserve the internal market within the United Kingdom"". This video can not be played Brexit deal will not jeopardise UK integrity DUP leader Arlene Foster said she made it clear to Mr Raab it is important that ""as well as not having as customs barriers, we cannot have any regulatory barriers"" between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK. When asked by BBC News NI if Mr Raab gave that assurance, Mrs Foster said it is ""an ongoing process"". Following her meeting with Mr Raab, Sinn FÃ©in president Mary Lou McDonald accused the government of acting ""in bad faith"" over Brexit and warned the border issue is not a ""footnote"". The DUP also met with Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab in Stormont She added that the government has ""stepped back"" from its commitment to uphold the Good Friday Agreement. The Northern Ireland ""backstop"" remains the major unresolved issuein negotiations. Ms McDonald added that the Sinn FÃ©in meeting with the Brexit secretary was ""direct"". Sinn FÃ©in President Mary Lou McDonald warned Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab that the border issue with Ireland is not a ""footnote"" Earlier, Mr Raab was accused of behaving ""like a thief in the night"" on his visit to Northern Ireland. He met politicians and business leaders and visited Warrenpoint Port in County Down and Larne Harbour in County Antrim. However, Sinn FÃ©in South Down MP Chris Hazzard protested that the Brexit secretary had refused to meet local politicians. Chris Hazzard said the Brexit negotiations were ""an absolute shambles"" Speaking outside Warrenpoint Port, Mr Hazzard said it was an example of ""the cynicism and disrespect"" being shown to the electorate of South Down and that Mr Raab had come in ""like a thief in the night"" without listening to people and their concerns about leaving the EU. SDLP MLA SinÃ©ad Bradley said it was ""an absolute disgrace"" that Mr Raab had not found time to meet local politicians. ""I suspect he did not want to hear the voice of the people of the area,"" she said. SinÃ©ad Bradley said she thought Mr Raab did not want to hear the voice of local people The Northern Ireland ""backstop"" remains the major unresolved issuein current withdrawal negotiations. Colm Shannon of Newry Chamber of Commerce described Mr Raab's visit to Warrenpoint as ""a welcome opportunity for local businesses to highlight our concerns about the border and future trading relationships with the EU"". ""It was a useful visit. He listened to the concerns of local businesses, particularly those that trade north-south,"" he said. He said an open border and freedom to trade east and west were essential to the continued success of the port. The backstop is an arrangement which will apply if the Irish border cannot be kept as frictionless as it is now in the context of a wider deal. Allow Twitter content?

The EU and UK have agreed the need for a backstop, but not how it should operate. The EU has proposed a backstop that would mean Northern Ireland staying in the EU customs union, large parts of the single market and the EU VAT system. The UK government has rejected it as a threat to the integrity of the UK and has suggested a backstop that would see the UK as a whole remaining aligned with the EU customs union for a limited period. A letter from Mr Raab, published earlier this week, suggested he expects a deal on the UK's exit from the EU to be agreed within three weeks. The Brexit secretary told a committee of MPs he was happy to appear before them to give evidence ""when a deal is finalised"" and ""currently expected 21 November to be suitable"". However, Mr Raab's own department later clarified that there was ""no set date for the negotiations to conclude"". November 21 was the date offered by the committee's chairman, it added. Meanwhile, Ireland's foreign minister has said it is up to the UK to ""intensify"" talks. Simon Coveney, who met Mr Raab on Tuesday evening, said time was short and while an overall deal was possible within three weeks, it had to take shape soon. Mr Coveney and Irish Justice Minister Charlie Flanagan hosted a meeting in Dublin on Friday for the latest session of the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference (BIIGC). It wasthe second time in about three months the conferencewas held, after not being convened for more than a decade. The British government was represented by Northern Ireland Secretary Karen Bradley and Cabinet Office Minister David Lidington.

"This video can not be played Cressida Dick says the Labour Party itself is not being investigated Police have launched a criminal inquiry into allegations of anti-Semitic hate crimes within the Labour Party. Met Police chief Cressida Dick told the BBC her officers were assessing online material because it appears ""there may have been a crime committed"". It comes after LBC Radio obtained what it said was an internal Labour document detailing 45 cases, involving messages posted by members on social media. Labour MP Margaret Hodge said the party should have notified the police itself. ""I think they have a duty of care to their members where there are allegations of race hate crimes,"" she told BBC News. ""For me as a Jewish Labour MP... there is a feeling of fear about and that is why firm action taken by the police and the party is so important."" Anti-Semitism in Labour a 'curse' says Hain A guide to Labour anti-Semitism claims Labour adopts anti-Semitism definition LBC handed the dossier to Ms Dick in an interview in September. Before it did so, it showed the material to former Met police officer Mak Chishty, whose view was that 17 instances should have been reported to the police for investigation, and another four were potential race hate crimes. LBC said the allegations included threats against members of Parliament, including a message on Facebook that a female Labour MP was a ""zionist extremist...who hates civilised people"" and is ""about to get a good kicking"". The Met Commissioner told BBC Radio 4's Today programme her officers were seeking advice from the Crown Prosecution Service and hoped to conclude the investigations quickly. She made it clear the Labour Party itself was not under investigation. ""We would always want institutions and political parties and similar to be able to regulate themselves. ""However, if somebody passes us material which they say amounts to a crime we have a duty to look at that and not just dismiss it. This video can not be played Why Labour's anti-Semitism problem isn't going away (First broadcast Aug 2018) ""We have been assessing some material that was passed to me, in a radio studio of all things, about two months ago and we are now investigating some of that material because it appears there may have been crime committed."" It is understood Labour has not been contacted by the police and has not been told of the exact nature of the allegations being investigated. A party spokesman said a ""robust system"" was in place for investigating complaints of alleged breaches of Labour rules by its members. ""Where someone feels they have been a victim of crime, they should report it to the police in the usual way."" Deputy Labour leader Tom Watson told Today he was ""not surprised"" by the allegations and anyone engaging in such behaviour must have the ""full force of the law"" applied to them. ""If this does one thing, it will silence a small number of people, who still believe that anti-Semitism doesn't exist in my party or in other parties, and that hampers the campaign to try and deal with this problem as quickly and as swiftly and as forcefully as we can,"" he said. In September, Labour's ruling body agreed to adopt in full an international definition of anti-Semitism, after a long-running row about Jeremy Corbyn's handling of the issue. It vowed to incorporate all the 11 examples of anti-Semitism cited by the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance into its code of conduct. But Jewish groups criticised an accompanying statement which the party said was aimed at protecting free speech. The party is currently working through a backlog of cases of alleged anti-Semitism complaints against members. But MP Dame Louise Ellman, vice-chair of Labour Friends of Israel, suggested the party had failed to properly investigate ""potentially very serious"" cases and she hoped, at the very least, Mr Corbyn was aware of the file. ""The disgraceful position Labour is in is continuing,"" she told BBC News. ""I would have thought the people responsible would have learnt their lesson by now. It appears they have not done so."" The Board of Deputies of British Jews said there was a ""deeply embedded"" culture of anti-Semitism within parts of Labour. ""This comes as no surprise to us,"" said the organisation's vice president Amanda Bowman. ""We have repeatedly set out what Labour needs to do, including taking firm action against anti-Semites and making its opaque processes transparent.""

"This video can not be played Justin Levene said the airport couldn't provide an adequate wheelchair last August The image is shocking: Justin Levene, a paraplegic man, dragging himself along the floor through Luton Airport after his self-propelling wheelchair was left behind on a flight. As he hauls himself through the arrivals hall on his backside, other passengers seem oblivious. Staff had offered to push him on a rigid high-backed chair but he refused as he felt it removed his independence. He is now suing Luton Airport - which says it is satisfied with its response. At the age of 20, Justin, from north London, coughed and herniated a disc. An operation to fix the problem went wrong leaving him paralysed below the waist and reliant on his self-propelling wheelchair. His disability has not held him back. Far from it. Justin Levene says he had no option but to drag himself through the airport rather than use a chair that needed to be pushed Almost 10 years on, Justin is an international wheelchair athlete, trainer and mentor to disabled athletes. He recently worked with orphans and disabled children in Moldova, helping to stage the country's first inclusive marathon. BBC's Gardner left stuck on plane again Journalist criticises airport for treatment of disabled passengers Four airports failing disabled passengers However, in August 2017 he arrived on a flight to Luton Airport to discover his custom-made, self-propelling wheelchair had been left behind. At the airport, staff offered to push him through the terminal on a high-backed wheelchair - an option he rejected as degrading. He asked if he could instead be transported in a motorised buggy. However, Luton does not have one. Speaking exclusively to the BBC, he said: ""I've worked very hard for a number of years to try and maintain all of my independence."" Without his wheelchair he says his self-sufficiency and independence ""was no longer there"". ""And to be in one of the chairs they were offering would make me feel humiliated and degraded. ""They insisted in trying to strap me down in it. ""I wouldn't have been able to adjust myself, and would have been at risk of getting a pressure sore."" Pressure sores can occur very quickly. Justin used a luggage trolley to propel himself the final distance to a taxi Justin says the airport's failure to provide him with either a self-propelling wheelchair or a motorised buggy left him with only one viable option - to drag himself along the floor for hundreds of yards. When he reached the exit of the terminal, he hauled himself on to a baggage trolley and used his hands to push himself along the ground to his taxi. Justin's athletics career means he travels widely and he has a custom-made wheelchair with a cushion to reduce pressure sores. He acknowledges that mistakes do happen, and wheelchairs can be left behind, but he has never faced a situation like this. ""Every single airport I've been to, no matter where it is, no matter how small the airport may have been, there has always been some form of equipment, whether it has been a self-propelled wheelchair or a buggy,"" he says. A significant number of UK and international airports provide self-propelling wheelchairs. On its website Glasgow Prestwick airport says wheelchairs, including self-propelling ones, are available free of charge to assist you in moving around the airport terminal. Virgin Atlantic and Virgin Australia specify on their websites that they will provide similar chairs. Wheelchairs at Palma Airport Mallorca Justin is now suing Luton Airport, saying it did not give adequate disability equality and awareness training to those responsible for providing mobility assistance. In a statement the airport said: ""On discovering that Mr Levene's flight had arrived without his wheelchair, our teams worked hard to find a solution, offering Mr Levene an assisted wheelchair as a temporary replacement. ""Mr Levene declined all offers of help as he deemed them unacceptable. ""While we apologise if Mr Levene was dissatisfied with the service he received, we are satisfied that our agents and staff did all they could in difficult circumstances."" Justin's story is at the cutting edge of society's awareness of disability issues and it poses a critical question: is it sufficient for service providers such as airports to provide some assistance, even if what is provided denies the disabled person their independence? People will have different views on whether the airport's offer was adequate. However, Justin says he ""felt humiliated"". ""I was angry that none of the staff seemed to understand the position or seemed to have any empathy for what was happening."" He says he would like to see greater acknowledgment of the importance of independence for disabled travellers. ""There should be appropriate equipment in every single airport. ""If something does happen, no-one should be put in the position that they are forced to crawl through the airport or drag themselves along the floor. ""And there should be some form of equipment to move themselves independently. Someone whose chair is their legs shouldn't be forced to be reliant on others for help."" Pictured in Argentina two years ago, Justin is an experienced traveller Paralympian and campaigner Anne Wafula Strike has also faced problems at airports and on trains - on one occasion suffering the indignity of having to wet herself on a train because the accessible toilet was not working. She understands why Justin did what he did. ""I would feel like my independence was being taken away and honestly, as a disabled person, we are still in charge of the type of people we want to be. ""Are we the people that just want to be pushed around - for people to be feeling sorry for us? No."" Celebrities who use wheelchairs have tweeted their support for Justin. Former paralympian Baroness Grey-Thompson wrote,external: ""Good for him. I hate being pushed through an airport."" The 11-times gold medal-winner said she had been forced to sit on the floor at airport gates because no wheelchair was available. And BBC security correspondent Frank Gardner,who has spoken of his experiences being left stranded in airportsas a wheelchair user, said the issue was one of ""personal dignity"".

Sue Willman, a partner at Justin's solicitors, Deighton Pierce Glynn, says the case ""isn't really about money, it's about access to justice"". ""It's time for Luton airport and other transport providers to be a bit more imaginative and enable disabled people to travel on equal terms with non-disabled passengers."" Meanwhile, Svetlana Kotova, from the disability equality charity Inclusion London, said it should be possible to provide assistance ""in a way that promotes our independence"".

"While 2018 saw an extremely hot summer in the UK, the previous decade was also warmer than the long-term average The UK has experienced more weather extremes over the last 10 years when compared with previous decades, a Met Office report has said. The hottest days have become almost 1C hotter, warm spells have increased, while the coldest days are not as cold. The number of so-called tropical nights - when temperatures stay above 20C - is increasing. The Met Office says these changes are consistent with warming driven by human activities. The new study compares UK weather data from the period 1961-1990 with the 10 years between 2008 and 2017. This video can not be played Why there were so many heatwaves around the world in 2018 2018 joint hottest summer for UK 2018 and 1976 - a tale of two heatwaves The study finds that on average the hottest day in each year over the recent 10-year period is 0.8C warmer than it was when compared to the earlier decades. The coldest days and nights have also become warmer, with temperatures on average 1.7C milder in recent years. To illustrate just how mild temperatures have been between 2008 and 2017, the report says that a significant area inland from the UK coast had, on average, less than one day per year with temperatures below zero. One intriguing finding has been about what are termed tropical nights, when temperatures stay above 20C. In the 30 years between1961 and 1990 there were no less than 44 nights where at least somewhere in the UK had a minimum temperature of 20C or higher. But in the 10 years between 2008 and 2017 there were 12 such nights. In 2018, there were five such nights, The Met Office expects to see more tropical nights as our climate continues to warm. These can be a big risk for elderly people. ""A particular concern for the health impacts of heat waves are these tropical nights where the human body doesn't get respite from the heat,"" said Dr Mark McCarthy from the Met Office's National Climate Information Centre. ""That is particularly so in large cities where it is further exacerbated by the urban heat island effect where the city will retain more of the heat of the day. ""Of those places where we do see tropical nights most frequently, London is one of those areas where it does occur.  It could become a very important index in future."" Another important measure of change that is highlighted in the study are the number of warm spells that have been recorded. This is the number of days per year that go well beyond the average long-term temperature for that 24-hour period. The study says that between 1961 and 1990 there were on average 5.3 days per year that went well beyond the average. In the 10 years to 2017, there were 13.2 days on average every year. Rainfall has also increased over the period of the report. The maximum five-day precipitation between 1916 and 1990 was 77.8mm - between 2008 and 2017, it averaged 81.4mm. Wildfires in various parts of the UK were a consequence of the hot summer of 2018 So what's been driving all this change? Met Office scientists say that natural variability may be impacting the rainfall situation across the UK - but when it comes to temperatures, the researchers say it is warming driven by humans. ""The temperature indicators are all consistent with the warming of the UK climate that we have observed over the last 50 years or so,"" said Dr McCarthy. ""Certainly for the temperature-based indices such as the warm spell duration and the cold and high temperature indices, they are consistent with that well known warming, and for the UK it's about the same rate of warming as has been seen globally.""

"The woman is so far unidentified A cheerleader for the San Francisco 49ers appeared to kneel during the US national anthem at an NFL game on Thursday, echoing recent player protests. The woman, who has not been identified, was pictured kneeling before the team's game against the Oakland Raiders. The 49ers are the former team of Colin Kaepernick, who knelt during the anthem as a protest back in 2016. His aim was to highlight police brutality against African-Americans. Decoding the NFL protests Kaepernick: From one man to a movement While the rest of the cheerleading squad held pom-poms aloft in unison during the Star-Spangled Banner, one woman knelt down and put her hands on her hips.

If confirmed, it would be the first time an NFL cheerleader has protested in this way, althoughfive members of a college team in Georgia did so last year.,external NFL protests began in 2016, when Kaepernick - then the 49ers' quarterback - refused to stand for the anthem. Similar demonstrations spread to other teams, with some choosing to link arms in solidarity rather than kneel. But the action proved controversial, drawing criticism from fans and from US President Donald Trump. He has called players who ""disrespect"" the US flag ""sons of bitches"" and called for them to be sacked. Kaepernick opted out of his contract with the San Francisco 49ers in March 2017 and is now suing the National Football League, arguing that team owners deliberately froze him out because of his activism. Two Miami Dolphins players knelt during the anthem before a game in September against the Oakland Raiders In May, the American football league saidNFL teams will be fined if their players kneel during the anthem. Those who do not wish to stand can stay in the locker room until the Star-Spangled Banner is over, the league said. What must Americans do during the anthem? President Trump welcomed the move, saying players who do not stand ""maybe... shouldn't be in the country"". A number of former cheerleaders told ELLE magazine,externalin an October 2017 article that they would never have taken part in the demonstrations. ""If I was still a cheerleader, I wouldn't kneel down, it's not my job,"" one told the magazine. ""I would be frustrated about what's going on in the country, but I would put my thoughts and opinions to the side and keep on moving.""

A year ago there were doubts that the Â£50 note would continue to exist at all. Fears that the largest denomination note was widely used by criminals and rarely for ordinary purchases prompted a government-led discussion on whether to abolish it. The note wasdescribed by Peter Sands, former chief executive of Standard Chartered bank, as the ""currency of corrupt elites, of crime of all sorts and of tax evasion"". However, in October, ministers announced plans for a new version of the note, to be printed in the UK, which they said would be plastic - so, more durable, secure and harder to forge. Some people have voiced concerns about the move to polymer banknotes after they werefound to contain traces of animal fats.

"This video can not be played Former Home Secretary Amber Rudd tells Today the department ""did not have a grip"" on Windrush Former Home Secretary Amber Rudd was let down by her own officials, an inquiry into the events leading up to her resignation has concluded. Ms Rudd quit the role in April, saying she had ""inadvertently misled"" MPs investigating the Windrush scandal. A report into the row found officials gave her the wrong information and then later failed to clear up the problem. Ms Rudd said leaks during her time in office were politically motivated and ""definitely intended to embarrass me"". Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, she added the leaks had come from a ""high level"" within the department. Friday's report says Ms Rudd was ""not supported as she should have been"". It adds she lost confidence in her officials to such an extent she prepared for a subsequent parliamentary appearance on her own. Amber Rudd's political highs and lows Amber Rudd resigns as home secretary Who are the Windrush generation? The report's author, the prime minister's advisor on ministers' interests, Sir Alex Allan, describes this decision as ""dangerous"". Downing Street said it expected the Home Office to respond to the ""difficult and important"" issues raised in the report but the prime minister did not believe civil servants were acting against ministers. The Windrush controversy began when it emerged that some migrants from Commonwealth countries, who were encouraged to settle in the UK from the late 1940s to 1973, were being wrongly declared illegal immigrants. Ms Rudd came under fire for the government's treatment of these residents - known as the Windrush generation - and their relatives and the wider impact of its ""hostile environment"" policy designed to deter illegal immigration. When sheaddressed MPs on the home affairs select committee on 25 April,Ms Rudd gave an inaccurate assertion that her department had no targets for immigration removals. She blamed officials, and the report - written in May - describes a series of confused email exchanges and crossed wires. Ms Rudd later admitted ""local"" targets for voluntary removals had been set but told the Commons she had not been aware of them. This was subsequently contradicted by a June 2017 memo from an official, copied to Ms Rudd, that referred to targets. While Sir Alex does not recommend any civil servant face a misconduct investigation, he singles out for criticism the then director general for immigration enforcement Hugh Ind, who has since moved to a different civil service role. This video can not be played Asked if she wants a return to the cabinet, Amber Rudd says she is ""not without ambition"" The report said he had offered a ""less than satisfactory performance"". Ms Rudd said the report demonstrated that immigration enforcement ""did not have a grip on what was going on"". She added she hoped changes would be made as a result of the report ""so that people get a better service"". The Hastings and Rye MP stopped short of saying she felt vindicated by the report, but hinted she was ready to return to front line politics. She said whether or not she returned to high office was now ""up to the prime minister"". Ms Rudd's came under fire for her department's treatment of the Windrush generation Speaking to the BBC last month about her career, Ms Rudd said she been misled by some civil servants about immigration enforcement. Ms Ruddtold Nick Robinson's Political Thinkingpodcast she should have done more to find out what was happening but when she started ""really probing... it became evident that [officials] didn't know what was going on."" She said it had made her more sceptical about civil servants - although she praised those she worked with on counter-terrorism as ""fantastic"". She added she would ""quite like"" to be home secretary again ""because there's a few things I'd like to do a bit better than last time"".

"This video can not be played Cressida Dick says the Labour Party itself is not being investigated Police have launched a criminal inquiry into allegations of anti-Semitic hate crimes within the Labour Party. Met Police chief Cressida Dick told the BBC her officers were assessing online material because it appears ""there may have been a crime committed"". It comes after LBC Radio obtained what it said was an internal Labour document detailing 45 cases, involving messages posted by members on social media. Labour MP Margaret Hodge said the party should have notified the police itself. ""I think they have a duty of care to their members where there are allegations of race hate crimes,"" she told BBC News. ""For me as a Jewish Labour MP... there is a feeling of fear about and that is why firm action taken by the police and the party is so important."" Anti-Semitism in Labour a 'curse' says Hain A guide to Labour anti-Semitism claims Labour adopts anti-Semitism definition LBC handed the dossier to Ms Dick in an interview in September. Before it did so, it showed the material to former Met police officer Mak Chishty, whose view was that 17 instances should have been reported to the police for investigation, and another four were potential race hate crimes. LBC said the allegations included threats against members of Parliament, including a message on Facebook that a female Labour MP was a ""zionist extremist...who hates civilised people"" and is ""about to get a good kicking"". The Met Commissioner told BBC Radio 4's Today programme her officers were seeking advice from the Crown Prosecution Service and hoped to conclude the investigations quickly. She made it clear the Labour Party itself was not under investigation. ""We would always want institutions and political parties and similar to be able to regulate themselves. ""However, if somebody passes us material which they say amounts to a crime we have a duty to look at that and not just dismiss it. This video can not be played Why Labour's anti-Semitism problem isn't going away (First broadcast Aug 2018) ""We have been assessing some material that was passed to me, in a radio studio of all things, about two months ago and we are now investigating some of that material because it appears there may have been crime committed."" It is understood Labour has not been contacted by the police and has not been told of the exact nature of the allegations being investigated. A party spokesman said a ""robust system"" was in place for investigating complaints of alleged breaches of Labour rules by its members. ""Where someone feels they have been a victim of crime, they should report it to the police in the usual way."" Deputy Labour leader Tom Watson told Today he was ""not surprised"" by the allegations and anyone engaging in such behaviour must have the ""full force of the law"" applied to them. ""If this does one thing, it will silence a small number of people, who still believe that anti-Semitism doesn't exist in my party or in other parties, and that hampers the campaign to try and deal with this problem as quickly and as swiftly and as forcefully as we can,"" he said. In September, Labour's ruling body agreed to adopt in full an international definition of anti-Semitism, after a long-running row about Jeremy Corbyn's handling of the issue. It vowed to incorporate all the 11 examples of anti-Semitism cited by the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance into its code of conduct. But Jewish groups criticised an accompanying statement which the party said was aimed at protecting free speech. The party is currently working through a backlog of cases of alleged anti-Semitism complaints against members. But MP Dame Louise Ellman, vice-chair of Labour Friends of Israel, suggested the party had failed to properly investigate ""potentially very serious"" cases and she hoped, at the very least, Mr Corbyn was aware of the file. ""The disgraceful position Labour is in is continuing,"" she told BBC News. ""I would have thought the people responsible would have learnt their lesson by now. It appears they have not done so."" The Board of Deputies of British Jews said there was a ""deeply embedded"" culture of anti-Semitism within parts of Labour. ""This comes as no surprise to us,"" said the organisation's vice president Amanda Bowman. ""We have repeatedly set out what Labour needs to do, including taking firm action against anti-Semites and making its opaque processes transparent.""

"This video can not be played Harry Wallace recites the names of every Kilmarnock player A four-year-old fan has won the hearts of players and staff at Kilmarnock football club by reciting the names of every member of the squad by their shirt number. Little Harry Wallace showed off his memory skills as he visited the club's Rugby Park stadium with his nursery. A videotweeted by Kilmarnock Community Sports Trust shows him rhyming off the 29 players' names,external. He cheekily includes himself as number 28 as no player wears that shirt. He was one of a group of youngsters from New Cumnock Early Childhood Centre who visited the stadium on Thursday. In the video, prompted by someone calling out the shirt numbers, he methodically lists off the players names and rather shyly, without looking up, says ""Me"" when he gets to number 28. Kilmarnock Community Sports Trust tweeted: ""We were very privileged to have a little visitor today as part of @NewCumnockECC little Harry (@Lucynharrysmum) who can rhyme off every @KilmarnockFC player in the squad! He's only 4!! Amazing! #WeAreKillie."" Harry met his favourite player Eamonn Brophy and did his ""wolf"" celebration His mum Lesley Wallace told BBC Scotland news online that he gets his love of Kilmarnock from his grandparents and dad who are all ""life-long fans"". She said: ""He likes going along with them to some of the games and he gets a programme and then memorises the players' names. ""He practises with his dad. He will just shout out a random number and Harry will immediately say the player who wears that shirt."" The voice heard prompting him in the video is his nursery key-worker Irene Mclaren. Harry's mum said he is normally a quiet boy in the nursery and staff were shocked when he started ""rattling off"" all the names. ""It's a wee confidence boost for him,"" she said.

"Jennifer Morant died in 2014 An Australian man has been sentenced to 10 years in jail for encouraging his wife's suicide. Graham Morant, 68, was convicted last month of counselling and aiding his wife, Jennifer Morant, to take her own life in 2014. He had been motivated by a desire to access Mrs Morant's life insurance benefits, a judge ruled. As sole beneficiary of the policy, Morant had stood to receive A$1.4m (Â£770,000; $1m). ""You counselled your wife to kill herself because you wanted to get your hands on the A$1.4m,"" Justice Peter Davis said in the Queensland Supreme Court on Friday. Mrs Morant had suffered from chronic pain, depression and anxiety, but was not terminally ill. Justice Davis said it appeared to be the first time globally that a person had been sentenced for counselling someone to die by suicide. However, in August 2017,a US woman was sentenced to two and a half years in prisonfor encouraging her boyfriend to commit suicide through texts and calls. Morant had pleaded not guilty to the charges, but a jury found that Mrs Morant would not have ended her life without his counselling. The 56-year-old woman was found dead alongside a petrol generator in her car on 30 November 2014. Nearby, a note read: ""Please don't resuscitate me."" Her husband had previously driven her to a hardware store to buy the generator, the jury was told. Morant, a devout Christian, had told his wife that he planned to use the insurance money to build a religious commune, according to prosecutors. On Friday, Justice Davis said Morant had shown no remorse for his offences. ""You took advantage of her vulnerability as a sick and depressed woman,"" he said. Morant received a maximum 10-year sentence for the charge of counselling suicide, and a six-year sentence for the charge of aiding suicide. The sentences will be served concurrently. He will be eligible for parole in October 2023. If you are feeling emotionally distressed and would like details of organisations in the UK which offer advice and support, go to bbc.co.uk/actionline.

"This video can not be played How has the death of Jamal Khashoggi impacted the war in Yemen? Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman told the US he considered murdered journalist Jamal Khashoggi to be a dangerous Islamist, media reports say. Prince Mohammed's reported phone call to the White House came before Saudi Arabia admitted he had been killed inside the Saudi consulate in Istanbul. Saudi Arabia has denied the reports in the Washington Post and New York Times. A Saudi national and well-known critic of Saudi rulers, Khashoggi was killed and his body dismembered on 2 October. His remains have not yet been found. On Friday,  Yasin Aktay, an adviser to Turkey's president, told Hurriyet newspaper officials believed that Khashoggi's body ""wasn't just cut up"", but that the murderers ""got rid of the body by dissolving it"". His fiancÃ©e, Hatice Cengiz, has called on world leaders to ""bring the perpetrators to justice"", inan editorial for the Guardian,externaland other newspapers. The Jamal Khashoggi story so far Who is the journalist that disappeared? Jamal Khashoggi in his own words Fire next to Saudi embassy in London Saudi Arabia denies its royal family was involved and says it is ""determined to find out all the facts"". Late last month, Prince Mohammed said that ""the crime was painful to all Saudis"". During the call with President Donald Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner and National Security Adviser John Bolton,Prince Mohammed said Khashoggi had been a member of the Muslim Brotherhood,external, a transnational Islamist organisation, the Washington Post reported. The phone call is reported to have taken place on 9 October, a week after Khashoggi disappeared. Prince Mohammed also reportedly urged the White House to preserve the US-Saudi alliance. Prince Mohammed urged the White House to preserve the US-Saudi alliance According to a New York Times report, friends of Khashoggi said he joined the Muslim Brotherhood as a young man, but later became inactive.,external Following the Arab Spring uprisings in 2011, Khashoggi expressed support for Islamist groups that had gained power in several countries. However, his family denied he was a member of the Brotherhood and said the murdered writer had himself denied this repeatedly in recent years. ""Jamal Khashoggi was not a dangerous person in any way possible. To claim otherwise would be ridiculous,"" his family said in a statement to the Washington Post. There is still no consensus on how Khashoggi died. He entered the consulate to sort out documents for his marriage to his Turkish fiancÃ©e, Hatice Cengiz. This video can not be played Jamal Khashoggi's fiancee: ""We didn't say any goodbyes"" On WednesdayTurkey said he was strangled immediately after entering the consulateand his body dismembered ""in accordance with plans made in advance"". Turkish media had previously quoted sources as saying Turkey had audio recordings proving that Khashoggi had been tortured before being murdered. Saudi Arabia has changed its account of what happened to Khashoggi. When he first disappeared, it said Khashoggi had walked out of the building alive. It later admitted he had been murdered, saying the killing was premeditated and a result of a ""rogue operation"". It has arrested 18 suspects, who, it says, will be prosecuted in Saudi Arabia. Turkey wants the suspects to be extradited. This video can not be played Jamal Khashoggi: What we know about the journalist's disappearance and death Turkey has steered away from publicly blaming Saudi Arabia for the killing. President Recep Tayyip Erdogan spoke to Saudi King Salman last week, and the two agreed to continue co-operating in the investigation. Saudi Arabia has faced a backlash over the death, including from its allies, who have called for answers. President Trump has said he is ""not satisfied"" with the Saudi account. However, he also said he was unwilling to sacrifice lucrative arms deals with the country. Although their US visas have been revoked, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said it would be a ""handful more weeks"" before the US knew enough to impose sanctions on individuals involved in Khashoggi's killing. Mr Pompeo said the US had ""deep and long-term strategic relationships"" with Saudi Arabia and said ""we intend to make sure that those relationships remain intact"". This video can not be played Why do Trump's Saudi job numbers keep growing? On Wednesday, France's Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian said Khashoggi's death was a ""crime"" and ""odious"". He said France was not ""dependent on our economic relations with Saudi Arabia"" and the country would impose sanctions, but no details were given. UK Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt also said it was an appalling act, adding thatit had ""possibly"" given the US and the UK a chance to put new pressure on Saudi Arabiaover other issues. Earlier,the US called for a swift cessation of hostilities in Yemen, where a Saudi-led coalition has been fighting rebels supported by its arch-enemy Iran. In an editorial published in the Guardian and the Washington Post,external, Ms Cengiz said Khashoggi had just bought a house and wished to start a family. She described the ""anguish"" she experienced since his ""brutal, barbaric and ruthless"" death. ""We must all send a clear message that authoritarian regimes cannot kill journalists ever again."" She called on governments around the world to take action to reveal the truth, accusing the United States of taking a position ""devoid of moral foundation."" ""If the democracies of the world do not take genuine steps to bring to justice the perpetrators of this brazen, callous act - one that has caused universal outrage among their citizens - what moral authority are they left with?,"" she asked.

"This video can not be played Footage shows the fight breaking out before the bus plunge Security footage from a bus which crashed into a river in China has revealed that the driver was fighting with a passenger moments earlier. The bus plunged 50m (164ft) off a bridge into the Yangtze River in Chongqing on Sunday - at least 13 people died and two more are missing. Early reports said the bus had swerved to avoid an oncoming vehicle. But the new footage shows the driver was being hit by a passenger and then struck her back. The bus, travelling at speed, then turns into the opposite lane and smashes through the safety barriers, before the footage cuts out. Police have said the fight was the cause of the crash, state newspaper People's Daily reports. Passengers can be heard screaming in the disturbing footage,external, shared by Chinese state media. Dashcam footage from an oncoming vehicle shows the bus crashing through the security barriers Police said the passenger, identified as a 48-year-old woman with the surname Liu, was angry that the bus had missed her stop. They said she hit the driver, named Ran, with her mobile phone when he refused to stop and let her off. Witnesses had said they saw the bus swerve across to the wrong side of the road before crashing through a safety barrier in Wanzhou district. A huge rescue operation was mounted with teams of divers and dozens of boats and cranes deployed. But there have been no reports of survivors. The wreckage of the bus was pulled out of the river from a depth of 71m on Wednesday night. Several of the passengers' bodies had to be retrieved by divers. The crash, on a well-maintained and relatively quiet bridge, has shocked China. Social media comments on Friday widely blamed the passenger for the crash, though some also criticised the driver for reacting. One poster on Weibo, Wanten888, said: ""If we see any passenger quarrelling with bus driver, we shouldn't stay quiet!"" Another said it was ""heartbreaking"" to hear the terrified passengers, while a Weibo user called Liza said there should be a law banning passengers from distracting bus drivers.

"Fast food outlets in Blackpool, which has the third most unhealthy High Street in the UK Britain's High Streets are getting unhealthier, according to areport analysing 70 major UK towns and cities.,external The Royal Society for Public Health (RSPH) ranked High Streets with more payday lenders, bookmakers, tanning salons and fast food outlets the worst. Grimsby led the unhealthy High Street list ahead of Walsall and Blackpool, while Edinburgh, Canterbury and Taunton had the healthiest outlets. There was a clear link between deprived areas and unhealthy High Streets. Outlets that were considered healthy included leisure centres, health services, libraries, museums and art galleries. The report also considered pubs and bars as being a positive presence on the High Street because they are centres for social interaction. However, pubs are in decline and many people are using the UK's 22,000 coffee shops as places to socialise, eat and drink instead. 'The food supplement that ruined my liver' Richer or poorer? Ask the calculator Ruddock 'deliberately broke Cole's legs' The number of fast-food outlets on UK streets rose by 4,000 between 2014 and 2017, mostly in deprived areas. The links between typically high-fat fast food, weight gain and obesity are well documented. Fast food outlets sometimes engage in what the RSPH report calls ""upselling""; where staff are trained to persuade customers to buy additional or larger portions. Payday lenders and bookmakers were considered unhealthy businesses because of the ""devastating consequences"" debt can have on health as well as on family and work life, the report said. London's High Streets were not considered in the report, as they have been ranked separately. Grimsby Walsall Blackpool Stoke-on-Trent Sunderland Northampton Bolton Wolverhampton Huddersfield Bradford Edinburgh Canterbury Taunton Shrewsbury Cheltenham York Brighton & Hove Eastbourne Exeter Cambridge The report paints a picture of the rapidly changing British High Street dominated by cafes and coffee shops, convenience stores, off-licences, vape shops and boarded-up premises. Vape shops were counted as a 'healthier' business, because of their role in discouraging smoking. However, the report added the ""precise long-term effects of vaping are unknown"". 'Five times more fast food' in poor areas Will Hammond's Budget save the High Street? Fast food shops 'flooding high streets' Shirley Cramer, RSPH chief executive said: ""When our time and money are converted into a loss at the bookmaker, a tan from a sunbed, a high-cost loan or a bucket of fried chicken, the High Street is enabling and supporting poor health behaviours. ""Our Health on the High Street rankings illustrate how unhealthy businesses concentrate in areas which already experience higher levels of deprivation, obesity and lower life expectancy. ""Reshaping these High Streets to be more health-promoting could serve as a tool to help redress this imbalance."" The RSPH developed what they call the ""Richter Scale of Health"" to evaluate the high streets. Each business was scored on the basis of whether it encouraged healthy lifestyle choices, promoted social interaction, mental wellbeing and greater access to health services. Scores ranged between 8 and -4.  Pubs, for example, scored 2 and libraries scored 5. Empty premises and tanning shops scored -1 and fast food shops -2. The scores for each outlet on the high street were added up and then divided by the total number of businesses on each street to reach a final score. Canterbury has the second healthiest High Street in the country Empty businesses on Freeman Street in Grimsby, which used to be the town's main shopping area The rise in online retail is linked to the growing numbers of empty premises, which have increased from 7% in 2007 to 11% in 2017. This year the High Street has seen several big name closures including Toys R Us and Maplin and, in this week's Budget, Chancellor Philip Hammond cut the business rates for small retailers, and proposed a new tax on online retailers in an effort to boost physical shops. An empty shop in Grimsby However industry bodies said the changes didn't go far enough. The RSPH is calling for further measures including urging local authorities to make vacant properties publicly accessible for what is known as ""meanwhile use"" - pop-up art galleries or community centres. The London rankings showed that the borough of Haringey boasted both the most unhealthy street, West Green Road in Seven Sisters, and the healthiest one, in Muswell Hill.

"This video can not be played Watch: Bolt trains for first time with A-League club Usain Bolt's trial with Australian football club Central Coast Mariners has come to an end. The Jamaican eight-time Olympic sprint champion, 32,joined the A-League sidefor an ""indefinite training period"" in August. He scored two goals in his first effortfor the Mariners in a friendly, but did not play matches when the season began. Efforts to secure a ""commercial solution"" to keep Bolt at the club had failed, the Mariners said on Friday. Last month,the Mariners said they had made a contract proposalbroken down into ""football"" and ""commercial"" terms. However, it hinged on a contribution from a ""third party"". Despite meetings with ""several promising potential partners"" no deal could be reached, the club said. 'Bolt has a touch like a trampoline' Mariners owner Mike Charlesworth thanked Bolt for his eight-week trial, describing it as a success. ""He integrated very well into the team and made great strides as a footballer,"" Mr Charlesworth said. The 100m and 200m world record holder has described it as his ""dream"" to play professional football. ""I would like to thank the Central Coast Mariners owners, management, staff, players and fans for making me feel so welcome during my time there,"" he said on Friday. Bolt, who retired from athletics in 2017, has previously trained with Borussia Dortmund, South African club Mamelodi Sundowns and Norway's Stromsgodset.

"Hackers appear to have compromised and published private messages from at least 81,000 Facebook users' accounts. The perpetrators told the BBC Russian Service that they had details from a total of 120 million accounts, which they were attempting to sell, although there are reasons to be sceptical about that figure. Facebook said its security had not been compromised. And the data had probably been obtained through malicious browser extensions. 'The food supplement that ruined my liver' How could a brand new plane crash? Trick or treat children 'given ecstasy' Facebook added it had taken steps to prevent further accounts being affected. The BBC understands many of the users whose details have been compromised are based in Ukraine and Russia. However, some are from the UK, US, Brazil and elsewhere. The hackers offered to sell access for 10 cents (8p) per account. However, their advert has since been taken offline. ""We have contacted browser-makers to ensure that known malicious extensions are no longer available to download in their stores,"" said Facebook executive Guy Rosen. ""We have also contacted law enforcement and have worked with local authorities to remove the website that displayed information from Facebook accounts."" The breach first came to light in September, when a post from a user nicknamed FBSaler appeared on an English-language internet forum. ""We sell personal information of Facebook users. Our database includes 120 million accounts,"" the user wrote. Facebook fined Â£500,000 for Cambridge Analytica scandal Facebook hack victims will not get ID theft protection Is Facebook's News Feed fading? The cyber-security company Digital Shadows examined the claim on behalf of the BBC and confirmed that more than 81,000 of the profiles posted online as a sample contained private messages. Data from a further 176,000 accounts was also made available, although some of the information - including email addresses and phone numbers - could have been scraped from members who had not hidden it. The BBC Russian Service contacted five Russian Facebook users whose private messages had been uploaded and confirmed the posts were theirs. One example included photographs of a recent holiday, another was a chat about a recent Depeche Mode concert, and a third included complaints about a son-in-law. Samples of the data were posted online to attract interest There was also an intimate correspondence between two lovers. One of the websites where the data had been published appeared to have been set up in St Petersburg. Its IP address has also been flagged by the Cybercrime Tracker service. It says the address had been used to spread the LokiBot Trojan, which allows attackers to gain access to user passwords. Personal shopping assistants, bookmarking applications and even mini-puzzle games are all on offer from various browsers such as Chrome, Opera and Firefox as third-party extensions. The little icons sit alongside your URL address bar patiently waiting for you to click on them. According to Facebook, it was one such extension that quietly monitored victims' activity on the platform and sent personal details and private conversations back to the hackers. Facebook has not named the extensions it believes were involved but says the leak was not its fault. Independent cyber-experts have told the BBC that if rogue extensions were indeed the cause, the browsers' developers might share some responsibility for failing to vet the programs, assuming they were distributed via their marketplaces. But the hack is still bad news for Facebook. The embattled network has had a terrible year for data security and questions will be asked about whether it  is proactive enough in responding to situations like this that affect large numbers of people. The BBC Russian Service emailed the address listed alongside the hacked details, posing as a buyer interested in buying two million accounts' details. The advertiser was asked whether the breached accounts were the same as those involved in either the Cambridge Analytica scandal or the subsequent security breach revealed in September. The BBC contacted five people who confirmed the private messages were theirs A reply in English came from someone calling themself John Smith. He said that the information had nothing to do with either data leak. He claimed that his hacking group could offer data from 120 million users, of whom 2.7 million were Russians. But Digital Shadows told the BBC that this claim was doubtful because it was unlikely Facebook would have missed such a large breach. John Smith did not explain why he had not advertised his services more widely. And when asked whether the leaks were linked to the Russian state or to the Internet Research Agency - a group of hackers linked to the Kremlin - he replied: ""No."" Wildfire sweeps through Hollywood Hills and threatens landmarks as chaos grips LA Paris Hilton among stars 'heartbroken' as she watches home 'burn to ground' Commuters warned of icy roads as cold snap continues to freeze UK Sound Of 2025: Ezra Collective are 'keeping music real' The Papers: 'Apocalypse' LA and 'Reeves faces extra tax rises' How Australia's beach cabana drama sparked a turf war H-1B: Visa row under Trump fuels anxiety for Indian dreamers 'I thought I was going to die': Jailed Venezuelan activist details brutality of prison life The man who could become Canada's future PM 'Trump 2.0' looms large over the global economy A politician was shot dead in Bangkok.

"The North-South divide in house prices will narrow in the next five years as property values in northern England rise by a fifth, a report suggests. Estate agent Savills has predicted that British house prices will rise in line with average incomes from 2019 to 2024. But house price growth will range from 21.6% in the North West of England to 4.5% in London. Scotland and Wales will see property values rise by nearly 20% over the same period, Savills believes. Lucian Cook, head of residential research at Savills, said that house prices in these areas were recovering more slowly from the financial crisis than London. ""Brexit angst is a major factor for market sentiment right now, particularly in London.  But it is the legacy of the global financial crisis - mortgage regulation in particular - combined with gradually rising interest rates that will really shape the market over the longer term,"" he said. Car and house insurance faces price probe Where does rent hit young people the hardest in Britain? House price growth 'slowest for five years' Five-year forecasts must be treated with caution, particularly in the housing market, owing to the variety of events that can affect the UK economy and the sector, down to a local level. The past five years have seen relatively little activity in the housing market. On Thursday, the Nationwide Building Society said that many homeowners were choosing to stay put, leading to relatively few properties being placed on the market. The predictions by Savills suggest that, across Britain, house prices will increase by 14.8% over the five years from 2019. That would add about Â£32,000 to the average property value, taking it to Â£248,086. The slowest rise will be in London, where prices are still the highest and have increased by 72% over the past 10 years, according to Savills. The South East and East of England will both see prices rise by 9.3%, it predicts. At the other end of the scale, there will be significant price rises in the North West of England, Yorkshire and the Humber (20.5%), the East Midlands, West Midlands and Wales (all 19.3%), Scotland (18.2%) and the North East of England (17.6%). Cities such as Manchester and Birmingham ""have the capacity to outperform their regions"" while Wales may benefit from the abolition of the Severn Bridge tolls, Savills said.

Car and house insurance faces price probe Where does rent hit young people the hardest in Britain? House price growth 'slowest for five years' Five-year forecasts must be treated with caution, particularly in the housing market, owing to the variety of events that can affect the UK economy and the sector, down to a local level. The past five years have seen relatively little activity in the housing market. On Thursday, the Nationwide Building Society said that many homeowners were choosing to stay put, leading to relatively few properties being placed on the market. The predictions by Savills suggest that, across Britain, house prices will increase by 14.8% over the five years from 2019. That would add about Â£32,000 to the average property value, taking it to Â£248,086. The slowest rise will be in London, where prices are still the highest and have increased by 72% over the past 10 years, according to Savills. The South East and East of England will both see prices rise by 9.3%, it predicts. At the other end of the scale, there will be significant price rises in the North West of England, Yorkshire and the Humber (20.5%), the East Midlands, West Midlands and Wales (all 19.3%), Scotland (18.2%) and the North East of England (17.6%). Cities such as Manchester and Birmingham ""have the capacity to outperform their regions"" while Wales may benefit from the abolition of the Severn Bridge tolls, Savills said.

"This video can not be played Chris Cornell spoke to Jools Holland in 2012 about his career in music The widow of US singer Chris Cornell is suing his doctor, accusing him of overprescribing drugs that ultimately led to his death in 2017. Vicki Cornell alleges that Dr Robert Koblin ""negligently and repeatedly"" prescribed the singer ""dangerous mind-altering controlled substances"". Cornell was found in a Detroit hotel room and his death was ruled a suicide. Traces of several drugs were found in his body - but a coroner's report said the drugs were not a cause of death. Dr Koblin has so far made no public comments on the issue. Cornell was the lead vocalist of Soundgarden. He died aged 52. Chris Cornell: Soundgarden star hanged himself It alleges that the drugs prescribed by Dr Koblin and his office ""impaired Cornell's cognition, clouded his judgement and caused him to engage in dangerous impulsive behaviours that he was unable to control, costing him his life"". The case, filed in Los Angeles Superior Court, focuses on large amounts of anti-anxiety drug Lorazepam (Ativan) prescribed to the singer between September 2015 and his death on 18 May 2017. Mrs Cornell also alleges that the doctor had not physically examined the singer before recommending the drugs. Cornell was born on 20 July 1964 in Seattle. Cornell was the lead singer of Soundgarden and also Audioslave As a solo artist, he released four studio albums.

"Children and adolescents account for nearly half of A&E attendances for sporting injuries, research suggests. An analysis of A&E data at two hospitals between 2012 and 2014 found 47% of attendances for sport-related injuries were made by under-19s. Football, rugby union and rugby league were linked to the most injuries in boys. For girls, it was trampolining, netball and horse-riding. Fourteen-year-old boys and 12-year-old girls were most likely to be injured. The authors say their findings should prompt schools to consider introducing injury prevention initiatives for child sport. Concerns raised over trampoline injuries 'Ban tackling in school rugby' for safety Researchers, who looked at 11,676 accident and emergency attendances for sport-related injuries at two hospitals in Oxfordshire, found 10- to 14-year-olds were the group of children most likely to be injured, followed by 15- to 19-year-olds. The data did not show how many of these attendances led to admissions. Almost a quarter of the injuries were fractures, most commonly to the upper limbs, the study found. Football came top of the list for injuries for boys. Trampolining was worst for girls. Rugby union was the sport most associated with head injury and concussion in boys. While for girls, head injuries were most common during horse riding. The top five injuries causing sport Prof Allyson Pollock, from Newcastle University, said: ""Everybody goes on about the benefits of sport but we don't actually look at the downsides and risks of sports and we don't design our prevention strategies to be informed by that. ""This study has shed some light on the causes and scale of sport injuries and should act as a springboard for injury prevention initiatives in child sport, targeted specifically at the causal mechanisms for these often serious injuries."" Prof Pollock said the popularity of football was probably why the sport was linked to so many injuries. In contrast, rugby union and rugby league had much lower levels of participation, she said. Prof Pollock said studies such as this one could help experts monitor the rate of injury across various child sports. Along with her colleagues, she says local authorities and schools should consider targeting sport injury prevention at children in the first four years of secondary school. They say that for younger age groups, trampolines in the home warrant improved safety, while rugby and horse-riding should also be a focus for interventions. Trampolines accounted for the most injuries in girls Although the study was based on information from two hospitals - the only two where such information was available - Prof Pollock said she expected the findings would be similar across the UK, albeit the proportion of injuries caused by certain sports may vary in some areas. Dr Max Davie, from the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, said A&E services were already ""very overstretched"". He added: ""To relieve the pressure on these services, it's important that we reduce the number of preventable admissions by making sports safer for children and young people. ""A scheme which would help to lessen the number of children becoming injured through sport is one that we would welcome.""

"Fast food outlets in Blackpool, which has the third most unhealthy High Street in the UK Britain's High Streets are getting unhealthier, according to areport analysing 70 major UK towns and cities.,external The Royal Society for Public Health (RSPH) ranked High Streets with more payday lenders, bookmakers, tanning salons and fast food outlets the worst. Grimsby led the unhealthy High Street list ahead of Walsall and Blackpool, while Edinburgh, Canterbury and Taunton had the healthiest outlets. There was a clear link between deprived areas and unhealthy High Streets. Outlets that were considered healthy included leisure centres, health services, libraries, museums and art galleries. The report also considered pubs and bars as being a positive presence on the High Street because they are centres for social interaction. However, pubs are in decline and many people are using the UK's 22,000 coffee shops as places to socialise, eat and drink instead. 'The food supplement that ruined my liver' Richer or poorer? Ask the calculator Ruddock 'deliberately broke Cole's legs' The number of fast-food outlets on UK streets rose by 4,000 between 2014 and 2017, mostly in deprived areas. The links between typically high-fat fast food, weight gain and obesity are well documented. Fast food outlets sometimes engage in what the RSPH report calls ""upselling""; where staff are trained to persuade customers to buy additional or larger portions. Payday lenders and bookmakers were considered unhealthy businesses because of the ""devastating consequences"" debt can have on health as well as on family and work life, the report said. London's High Streets were not considered in the report, as they have been ranked separately. Grimsby Walsall Blackpool Stoke-on-Trent Sunderland Northampton Bolton Wolverhampton Huddersfield Bradford Edinburgh Canterbury Taunton Shrewsbury Cheltenham York Brighton & Hove Eastbourne Exeter Cambridge The report paints a picture of the rapidly changing British High Street dominated by cafes and coffee shops, convenience stores, off-licences, vape shops and boarded-up premises. Vape shops were counted as a 'healthier' business, because of their role in discouraging smoking. However, the report added the ""precise long-term effects of vaping are unknown"". 'Five times more fast food' in poor areas Will Hammond's Budget save the High Street? Fast food shops 'flooding high streets' Shirley Cramer, RSPH chief executive said: ""When our time and money are converted into a loss at the bookmaker, a tan from a sunbed, a high-cost loan or a bucket of fried chicken, the High Street is enabling and supporting poor health behaviours. ""Our Health on the High Street rankings illustrate how unhealthy businesses concentrate in areas which already experience higher levels of deprivation, obesity and lower life expectancy. ""Reshaping these High Streets to be more health-promoting could serve as a tool to help redress this imbalance."" The RSPH developed what they call the ""Richter Scale of Health"" to evaluate the high streets. Each business was scored on the basis of whether it encouraged healthy lifestyle choices, promoted social interaction, mental wellbeing and greater access to health services. Scores ranged between 8 and -4.  Pubs, for example, scored 2 and libraries scored 5. Empty premises and tanning shops scored -1 and fast food shops -2. The scores for each outlet on the high street were added up and then divided by the total number of businesses on each street to reach a final score. Canterbury has the second healthiest High Street in the country Empty businesses on Freeman Street in Grimsby, which used to be the town's main shopping area The rise in online retail is linked to the growing numbers of empty premises, which have increased from 7% in 2007 to 11% in 2017. This year the High Street has seen several big name closures including Toys R Us and Maplin and, in this week's Budget, Chancellor Philip Hammond cut the business rates for small retailers, and proposed a new tax on online retailers in an effort to boost physical shops. An empty shop in Grimsby However industry bodies said the changes didn't go far enough. The RSPH is calling for further measures including urging local authorities to make vacant properties publicly accessible for what is known as ""meanwhile use"" - pop-up art galleries or community centres. The London rankings showed that the borough of Haringey boasted both the most unhealthy street, West Green Road in Seven Sisters, and the healthiest one, in Muswell Hill.

"This video can not be played Amber Rudd faced criticism over the existence of Home Office removals targets and her knowledge of them Amber Rudd's resignation over the question of whether she knew about targets to remove illegal immigrants has shown once again that being home secretary remains one of the most high-risk jobs in government. Although Theresa May lasted more than six years in the job and used it as a springboard to Downing Street, her successor joins a long list of others, including David Blunkett, Jacqui Smith and Charles Clarke, who ended up paying the price for personal or administrative failings with their jobs. Before the full extent of the Windrush controversy became clear, shining an unflattering light on the workings and culture of her department and Ms Rudd's own command of her brief, the 54-year-old had been regarded as one of the Conservatives' rising stars. Her views on Europe - she is one of the cabinet's most pro-European voices and her brother Roland helped run the Remain campaign - were not to everyone's tastes within the party but despite this she was seen as being capable, tough and - until recent weeks - unflappable. In her early years in Parliament after being elected in 2010, she was regarded as being a protege of George Osborne on the liberal-modernising wing of the party, a member of the so-called ""friends of George"". Ms Rudd at a constituency event in 2011 - she scraped home in last year's election despite a significant swing to Labour She was promoted rapidly under David Cameron, working for a while in the Treasury and becoming energy and climate change secretary after the Conservatives' surprise victory in the 2015 general election. Her growing reputation was further enhanced during the 2016 Brexit referendum. She was one of the star performers during the main TV debate - caustically taking Boris Johnson to task and suggesting he was ""not the kind of man that you would want to drive you home at the end of the evening"". She not only survived Theresa May's clearout of Cameron/Osborne supporters after she became PM but was rewarded with the plum job of home secretary, stepping into her boss's shoes. Her first year in the Home Office went smoothly enough although dealing with the succession of terror attacks that took place during 2017 was a harrowing experience. The 54-year old was appointed home secretary in July 2016 She has been MP for Hastings and Rye in East Sussex since 2010 She won the seat in 2017 by just 346 votes She was a Remain supporter in 2016 referendum - her brother helped fund campaign She was married for five years to the late journalist and writer AA Gill An Edinburgh University graduate, she previously worked in banking and recruitment She was credited as a consultant on the 1994 hit film Four Weddings and a Funeral Ms Rudd earned plenty of plaudits after deputising for Mrs May in the 2017 general election leadership debate, despite her father Tony - a stockbroker and businessman - having died a few days before. She used up one of her political lives on election night when it looked, for several hours, as if she had lost her Hastings and Rye seat and ended up only scraping home by 346 votes. This video can not be played Amber Rudd and Jeremy Corbyn in the General election 2017 debate She remained in the Home Office after the election and with questions over Mrs May's future swirling around, she was talked of as a potential successor who could appeal to both wings of the party. But in the face of daily revelations about the plight of Windrush migrants and their families, Ms Rudd appeared slow to respond and, despite numerous apologies, to appreciate the scale and significance of the crisis. Previously regarded as having more liberal views on immigration than her predecessor, she was soon accused of making the government's ""hostile environment"" policy for illegal immigrants even tougher, with disastrous repercussions for thousands of people in the country legally. More significantly, she was forced to publicly backtrack on claims that the Home Office did not have targets for removing immigration offenders, admitting to MPs she had been wrong. She was appointed energy and climate change secretary by David Cameron after the Tories' 2015 election win The opposition soon called for her head, describing her as a ""human shield"" for the prime minister. But there was no appetite on the Tory benches - either from Brexiters or Remainers - for her to go, with three cabinet ministers already having had to quit in the past six months. The final nail in her coffin was when her claim to the Commons that she was not aware of the targets was contradicted not only by a memo she had been sent by a top Home Office official, published by the Guardian, but also a letterMs Rudd herself sent to the prime minister,externalsetting out ""ambitious but deliverable"" deportation targets. Ms Rudd published a strategy earlier this month on tackling violent crime, after a rise in deaths in London Before entering politics, Ms Rudd had successful careers working in finance, journalism and executive recruitment - as well as somewhat incongruously being ""aristocracy consultant"" on the hit film Four Weddings and a Funeral. She was married for five years to the late writer and Sunday Times columnist AA Gill, with whom she had two children. At a recent lunch for Westminster journalists, she responded to questions about her future leadership ambitions by saying that she merely ""wanted to stay in the game"". She will now have more time to ponder her own future in that game from the backbenches and also to reflect on the conventional wisdom in Westminster - seemingly dispelled by Mrs May - that the Home Office is the graveyard of many a political career. The British troopship HMT Empire Windrush anchored at Tilbury Docks, Essex, on 21 June 1948. It is regarded as the symbolic starting point of a wave of Caribbean migration known as the ""Windrush generation"". Now, despite living and working in the UK for decades, it has emerged that some of the families of these Windrush migrants have been threatened with deportation and denied access to the NHS, benefits and pensions.

"A yellow-throated tanager Scientists have produced new evidence that climate change is driving tropical bird species who live near a mountain top to extinction. Researchers have long predicted many creatures will seek to escape a warmer world by moving towards higher ground. However, those living at the highest levels cannot go any higher, and have been forecast to decline. This study found that eight bird species that once lived near a Peruvian mountain peak have now disappeared. Climate friendly cooling shows promise Exxon accused of climate change 'fraud' Researchers are particularly concerned about tropical mountain ranges and the impacts of climate change. ""The tropical mountain areas are the hottest of biodiversity hotspots; they harbour more species than any other place on Earth,"" lead author Dr Benjamin Freeman from the University of British Columbia told BBC News. ""It's only got a little bit warmer in the tropics and tropical plants and animals seem to be living quite a bit higher now than they used to."" The species that live in these regions are also hugely vulnerable because the difference in temperatures between lower and higher elevations in tropical regions is not as great as it is in other parts of the world. This means that moving up the slopes may not be as much of a solution for species in the tropics as it is elsewhere. To test these ideas, scientists carried out a survey in 2017 of bird species that lived on a remote Peruvian mountain peak. The team covered the same ground, at the same time of year, and used the the same methods as a previous survey, carried out in 1985. A russet-crowned warbler They found that on average, species' ranges had shifted up the slope between the two surveys. Most of the species that had been found at the highest elevations declined significantly in both range and abundance. The researchers say that recent warming constitutes an ""escalator to extinction"" for some of these species with temperatures in the area increasing by almost half a degree Celsius between the two surveys. Of 16 species that were restricted to the very top of the ridge, eight had disappeared completely in the most recent survey. ""These birds have moved up the mountain as much as you'd predict if temperature was this master switch that controlled where they live,"" said Dr Freeman. ""The ones that lived near the top 30 years ago are gone."" A scarlet-breasted fruiteater which inhabits high elevations on the Cerro de Pantiacolla in Peru The authors warn that rising temperatures will continue to drive widespread ""extirpations and extinctions"" of high-elevation animals and plants across the tropical Andes mountains. In contrast, the scientists found that bird species living in lowland areas were benefitting from climate change, expanding their ranges, and shifting their upper limits further up the mountains. However, even the species that are now on the move may find that they run out of options over time. The authors say that if global temperatures rise this century between 2.6C and 4.8C, this could push tropical species a further 500m to 900m up the the slopes. This might prove too far for some. Another problem is that many mountains have been cleared of their forests which limits the capacity of species to move up at all. ""You really can't ignore this process if you are thinking of long-term biodiversity and conservation in these areas,"" said Dr Freeman. ""The way to deal with it is to maintain protected habitat corridors that stretch across large elevational gradients.""

"Apple briefly lost its $1tn valuation on Thursday when its shares fell 7% in after-hours trading despite posting record results. The tech giant's strategy of charging more for its phones has paid off, with revenues jumping in the last three months despite relatively flat sales. Revenues rose 20% to $62.9bn year-on-year, and profits rose 31% to $14.1bn. But a warning of possible weaker sales in coming months sparked a share price slide after official trading ended. The sell-off accelerated after Apple said it would stop disclosing the number of units sold. Apple executives defended their decision, arguing that the figures are no longer good indicators of the firm's financial health. Analysts, however, warned that outsiders may view it as a move that masks less sunny performance. The total number of smartphones sold by all makers globally declined for the first time in 2017. But Apple's strategy of charging higher prices for its phones has helped it to shrug off flagging demand. The firm sold 46.9 million iPhones in the quarter to end-September, a modest rise on the 46.7 million sold for the same period last year. The California-based company is also making more money from ""services"" such as the App store, Apple Music and Apple Pay. Services revenue hit a record $10bn in the quarter. For the firm's full 2018 financial year, profits increased 23% to $59.5bn, as revenue rose 16% to $265.5bn. ""I can reassure that it is our objective to grow unit sales for every product category that we have,"" Apple's chief financial officer Luca Maestri told financial analysts. ""A unit of sale is less relevant today than it was in the past."" Despite the record figures, shares in the firm sank in after-hours trading, falling by 4% and then by more than 7%. They quickly started to rebound, lifting the firm's market value back above $1tn. The decline was blamed in part on a disappointing forecast for the important Christmas season. Apple said it expects sales of $89bn to $93bn for the quarter that ends 31 December, against Wall Street's $93bn forecast. It posted sales of $88.3bn in the quarter last year. Chief executive Tim Cook said that Apple is ""seeing some macroeconomic weakness in some of the emerging markets"" such as Turkey, India, Brazil and Russia. He said some of that is due to currency fluctuation. Chief financial officer Luca Maestri said Apple also faces some supply uncertainty related to the roll-out of its latest products. The firm, which relies on China for manufacturing, is at risk as trade tensions between US and China rise, though its products have so far been spared from tariffs. Mr Cook said he remains optimistic that the two countries will resolve their issues.

"Children and adolescents account for nearly half of A&E attendances for sporting injuries, research suggests. An analysis of A&E data at two hospitals between 2012 and 2014 found 47% of attendances for sport-related injuries were made by under-19s. Football, rugby union and rugby league were linked to the most injuries in boys. For girls, it was trampolining, netball and horse-riding. Fourteen-year-old boys and 12-year-old girls were most likely to be injured. The authors say their findings should prompt schools to consider introducing injury prevention initiatives for child sport. Concerns raised over trampoline injuries 'Ban tackling in school rugby' for safety Researchers, who looked at 11,676 accident and emergency attendances for sport-related injuries at two hospitals in Oxfordshire, found 10- to 14-year-olds were the group of children most likely to be injured, followed by 15- to 19-year-olds. The data did not show how many of these attendances led to admissions. Almost a quarter of the injuries were fractures, most commonly to the upper limbs, the study found. Football came top of the list for injuries for boys. Trampolining was worst for girls. Rugby union was the sport most associated with head injury and concussion in boys. While for girls, head injuries were most common during horse riding. The top five injuries causing sport Prof Allyson Pollock, from Newcastle University, said: ""Everybody goes on about the benefits of sport but we don't actually look at the downsides and risks of sports and we don't design our prevention strategies to be informed by that. ""This study has shed some light on the causes and scale of sport injuries and should act as a springboard for injury prevention initiatives in child sport, targeted specifically at the causal mechanisms for these often serious injuries."" Prof Pollock said the popularity of football was probably why the sport was linked to so many injuries. In contrast, rugby union and rugby league had much lower levels of participation, she said. Prof Pollock said studies such as this one could help experts monitor the rate of injury across various child sports. Along with her colleagues, she says local authorities and schools should consider targeting sport injury prevention at children in the first four years of secondary school. They say that for younger age groups, trampolines in the home warrant improved safety, while rugby and horse-riding should also be a focus for interventions. Trampolines accounted for the most injuries in girls Although the study was based on information from two hospitals - the only two where such information was available - Prof Pollock said she expected the findings would be similar across the UK, albeit the proportion of injuries caused by certain sports may vary in some areas. Dr Max Davie, from the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, said A&E services were already ""very overstretched"". He added: ""To relieve the pressure on these services, it's important that we reduce the number of preventable admissions by making sports safer for children and young people. ""A scheme which would help to lessen the number of children becoming injured through sport is one that we would welcome.""

"Jennifer Morant died in 2014 An Australian man has been sentenced to 10 years in jail for encouraging his wife's suicide. Graham Morant, 68, was convicted last month of counselling and aiding his wife, Jennifer Morant, to take her own life in 2014. He had been motivated by a desire to access Mrs Morant's life insurance benefits, a judge ruled. As sole beneficiary of the policy, Morant had stood to receive A$1.4m (Â£770,000; $1m). ""You counselled your wife to kill herself because you wanted to get your hands on the A$1.4m,"" Justice Peter Davis said in the Queensland Supreme Court on Friday. Mrs Morant had suffered from chronic pain, depression and anxiety, but was not terminally ill. Justice Davis said it appeared to be the first time globally that a person had been sentenced for counselling someone to die by suicide. However, in August 2017,a US woman was sentenced to two and a half years in prisonfor encouraging her boyfriend to commit suicide through texts and calls. Morant had pleaded not guilty to the charges, but a jury found that Mrs Morant would not have ended her life without his counselling. The 56-year-old woman was found dead alongside a petrol generator in her car on 30 November 2014. Nearby, a note read: ""Please don't resuscitate me."" Her husband had previously driven her to a hardware store to buy the generator, the jury was told. Morant, a devout Christian, had told his wife that he planned to use the insurance money to build a religious commune, according to prosecutors. On Friday, Justice Davis said Morant had shown no remorse for his offences. ""You took advantage of her vulnerability as a sick and depressed woman,"" he said. Morant received a maximum 10-year sentence for the charge of counselling suicide, and a six-year sentence for the charge of aiding suicide. The sentences will be served concurrently. He will be eligible for parole in October 2023. If you are feeling emotionally distressed and would like details of organisations in the UK which offer advice and support, go to bbc.co.uk/actionline.

"The head of the UK's largest police force has backed a call for officers to focus on ""traditional values"". Metropolitan Police Commissioner Cressida Dick said she ""absolutely"" agreed with a senior officer who said forces were too stretched to pursue ""deserving"" issues. National Police Chiefs' Council chair Sara Thornton had saidincidents of misogyny should not be pursued. Ms Dick said her priority in London was tackling violent crime. Speaking at the London Assembly, she said: ""There's never been a fag paper between us on this... I'm with Sara."" Reality Check: Have police priorities changed? Police risk becoming 'irrelevant', MPs warn Focus on crime not misogyny - police chief Amid a fresh debate about police priorities, Ms Thornton said that although it may be ""desirable"" to log incidents of misogyny, forces did not have the resources to deal with such cases and should ""refocus on core policing"" - such as tackling violent crime and burglary. She also said investigating claims against dead people was taking resources away from investigating ""today's crime today"". In her remarks, the Met Commissioner suggested there was a need to limit criminal inquiries into dead people to those cases where there were co-conspirators who are alive. Ms Dick said: ""When I talked about traditional values what I meant was policing by consent, local policing and in particular our core values of courage, professionalism, integrity and of compassion. ""That's quite historic and quite old-fashioned in a sense but I'm contrasting that with the need to be very modern in our approach."" She added: ""Violent crime is too high in London and that will be my priority. ""I define it broadly from terrorism through to sexual offences and child protection and street violence and domestic abuse."" This video can not be played Chief Constable Sara Thornton: ""The reality is we can't just do everything"" Speaking to police chiefs and police and crime commissioners on Wednesday, Ms Thornton expressed concern abouta government-commissioned review into whether misogyny should be treated as a hate crime. However, her remarks have faced criticism. Sue Fish, the former chief constable of Nottinghamshire Police, which has been reporting incidents of misogyny as a hate crime for the past two years, described Ms Thornton's comments as ""shameful"". She told BBC Radio 4's The World at One: ""We're reinforcing that women are not worthy of any sort of service from the police,"" she said, adding that historically, police treatment of female victims of rape and domestic violence had been ""appalling"".

He scored two goals in his first effortfor the Mariners in a friendly, but did not play matches when the season began. Efforts to secure a ""commercial solution"" to keep Bolt at the club had failed, the Mariners said on Friday. Last month,the Mariners said they had made a contract proposalbroken down into ""football"" and ""commercial"" terms. However, it hinged on a contribution from a ""third party"". Despite meetings with ""several promising potential partners"" no deal could be reached, the club said. 'Bolt has a touch like a trampoline' Mariners owner Mike Charlesworth thanked Bolt for his eight-week trial, describing it as a success. ""He integrated very well into the team and made great strides as a footballer,"" Mr Charlesworth said. The 100m and 200m world record holder has described it as his ""dream"" to play professional football. ""I would like to thank the Central Coast Mariners owners, management, staff, players and fans for making me feel so welcome during my time there,"" he said on Friday.

"While 2018 saw an extremely hot summer in the UK, the previous decade was also warmer than the long-term average The UK has experienced more weather extremes over the last 10 years when compared with previous decades, a Met Office report has said. The hottest days have become almost 1C hotter, warm spells have increased, while the coldest days are not as cold. The number of so-called tropical nights - when temperatures stay above 20C - is increasing. The Met Office says these changes are consistent with warming driven by human activities. The new study compares UK weather data from the period 1961-1990 with the 10 years between 2008 and 2017. This video can not be played Why there were so many heatwaves around the world in 2018 2018 joint hottest summer for UK 2018 and 1976 - a tale of two heatwaves The study finds that on average the hottest day in each year over the recent 10-year period is 0.8C warmer than it was when compared to the earlier decades. The coldest days and nights have also become warmer, with temperatures on average 1.7C milder in recent years. To illustrate just how mild temperatures have been between 2008 and 2017, the report says that a significant area inland from the UK coast had, on average, less than one day per year with temperatures below zero. One intriguing finding has been about what are termed tropical nights, when temperatures stay above 20C. In the 30 years between1961 and 1990 there were no less than 44 nights where at least somewhere in the UK had a minimum temperature of 20C or higher. But in the 10 years between 2008 and 2017 there were 12 such nights. In 2018, there were five such nights, The Met Office expects to see more tropical nights as our climate continues to warm. These can be a big risk for elderly people. ""A particular concern for the health impacts of heat waves are these tropical nights where the human body doesn't get respite from the heat,"" said Dr Mark McCarthy from the Met Office's National Climate Information Centre. ""That is particularly so in large cities where it is further exacerbated by the urban heat island effect where the city will retain more of the heat of the day. ""Of those places where we do see tropical nights most frequently, London is one of those areas where it does occur.  It could become a very important index in future."" Another important measure of change that is highlighted in the study are the number of warm spells that have been recorded. This is the number of days per year that go well beyond the average long-term temperature for that 24-hour period. The study says that between 1961 and 1990 there were on average 5.3 days per year that went well beyond the average. In the 10 years to 2017, there were 13.2 days on average every year. Rainfall has also increased over the period of the report. The maximum five-day precipitation between 1916 and 1990 was 77.8mm - between 2008 and 2017, it averaged 81.4mm. Wildfires in various parts of the UK were a consequence of the hot summer of 2018 So what's been driving all this change? Met Office scientists say that natural variability may be impacting the rainfall situation across the UK - but when it comes to temperatures, the researchers say it is warming driven by humans. ""The temperature indicators are all consistent with the warming of the UK climate that we have observed over the last 50 years or so,"" said Dr McCarthy. ""Certainly for the temperature-based indices such as the warm spell duration and the cold and high temperature indices, they are consistent with that well known warming, and for the UK it's about the same rate of warming as has been seen globally.""

"This video can not be played Footage shows the fight breaking out before the bus plunge Security footage from a bus which crashed into a river in China has revealed that the driver was fighting with a passenger moments earlier. The bus plunged 50m (164ft) off a bridge into the Yangtze River in Chongqing on Sunday - at least 13 people died and two more are missing. Early reports said the bus had swerved to avoid an oncoming vehicle. But the new footage shows the driver was being hit by a passenger and then struck her back. The bus, travelling at speed, then turns into the opposite lane and smashes through the safety barriers, before the footage cuts out. Police have said the fight was the cause of the crash, state newspaper People's Daily reports. Passengers can be heard screaming in the disturbing footage,external, shared by Chinese state media. Dashcam footage from an oncoming vehicle shows the bus crashing through the security barriers Police said the passenger, identified as a 48-year-old woman with the surname Liu, was angry that the bus had missed her stop. They said she hit the driver, named Ran, with her mobile phone when he refused to stop and let her off. Witnesses had said they saw the bus swerve across to the wrong side of the road before crashing through a safety barrier in Wanzhou district. A huge rescue operation was mounted with teams of divers and dozens of boats and cranes deployed. But there have been no reports of survivors. The wreckage of the bus was pulled out of the river from a depth of 71m on Wednesday night. Several of the passengers' bodies had to be retrieved by divers. The crash, on a well-maintained and relatively quiet bridge, has shocked China. Social media comments on Friday widely blamed the passenger for the crash, though some also criticised the driver for reacting. One poster on Weibo, Wanten888, said: ""If we see any passenger quarrelling with bus driver, we shouldn't stay quiet!"" Another said it was ""heartbreaking"" to hear the terrified passengers, while a Weibo user called Liza said there should be a law banning passengers from distracting bus drivers.

"The National Crime Agency is investigating Arron Banks and his Leave.EU campaign for alleged offences committed at the 2016 EU referendum. Mr Banks and another senior campaign figure, Liz Bilney, were referred to the agency by the Electoral Commission. The watchdog said it suspected Mr Banks was not the ""true source"" of loans to the campaign and the money had come ""from impermissible sources"". Mr Banks denied any wrongdoing and said he welcomed the police investigation. He said he was ""confident that a full and frank investigation will finally put an end to the ludicrous allegations levelled against me and my colleagues"". ""There is no evidence of any wrongdoing from the companies I own. I am a UK taxpayer and I have never received any foreign donations.

Some Remain supporters have suggested Brexit should be put on hold pending the outcome of the inquiry. SNP MP Kirsty Blackman told the BBC's Politics Live programme: ""If people are found to be breaking electoral law, then I think there is an issue that you look at the possible validity of the results."" But Labour MP Stephen Kinnock said public trust in the source of political donations was ""bigger than Brexit"". ""I don't think there is a natural connection to this and calling for a re-run of the referendum. I would rather we focus our resources on holding Mr Banks to account,"" he told BBC News. Under UK law, loans and donations to registered campaigners can only come from permissible sources, which essentially excludes overseas or foreign funding. The law was introduced by the Labour government in 2000 after a series of scandals involving overseas donors accused of trying to influence British laws and elections. Leave.EU's chief executive Liz Bilney said all of the money had come from Mr Banks and he was the ""ultimate beneficial owner"" of the companies that had loaned it. As a UK domiciled taxpayer Mr Banks was ""completely permissible to donate money to campaigns as he sees fit"", she told BBC Radio 4's The World at One programme. She denied claims the money had come from Russian sources, saying: ""I run the group of companies where the money was from and we don't have any transactions that are from Russia."" And she said the Electoral Commission had ""failed to understand the nature of the loan agreements"" and were seeing them through ""their own biased lens"". ""I am confident that all the matters will be completely resolved and I will be exonerated and so will Arron and everybody else involved,"" she added. This video can not be played Liz Bilney: ""I'm confident I will be exonerated and so will Arron"" The Electoral Commission investigation focused on Â£2m reported to have been loaned to Better for the Country, which ran Leave.EU, by Mr Banks and his group of insurance companies. It also examined a further Â£6m reported to have been given to the organisation, on behalf of Leave.EU, by Mr Banks alone. The commission's legal chief, Bob Posner, said: ""We have reasonable grounds to suspect money given to Better for the Country came from impermissible sources and that Mr Banks and Ms Bilney, the responsible person for Leave.EU, knowingly concealed the true circumstances under which this money was provided. ""This is significant because at least Â£2.9m of this money was used to fund referendum spending and donations during the regulated period of the EU referendum. ""Our investigation has unveiled evidence that suggests criminal offences have been committed which fall beyond the remit of the commission. ""This is why we have handed our evidence to the NCA to allow them to investigate and take any appropriate law enforcement action. This is now a criminal investigation."" He said the financial transactions investigated by the commission included companies incorporated in Gibraltar and the Isle of Man, which were ""beyond the reach"" of the watchdog. The Bristol-based insurance tycoon, who was born in Cheshire, was a Lloyd's underwriter before starting his own firms The twice married father-of-five has been a close friend and supporter of Nigel Farage Mr Banks was a Conservative supporter until 2014 when he defected to UKIP, giving them Â£1m He is said to be one of the biggest political donors in UK history, thought to have given up to Â£9.6m to Leave.EU - which he co-founded - and UKIP Leave.EU, which was backed by then UKIP leader Mr Farage, lost out to Vote Leave in the battle to become the official Leave campaign in the 2016 EU referendum His Leave.EU campaign targeted its message at voters angry about EU immigration The National Crime Agency, which is able to investigate across international borders, said electoral law offences would ""not routinely fall"" within its remit. But it added: ""The nature of the necessary inquiries and the potential for offences to have been committed other than under electoral law lead us to consider an NCA investigation appropriate in this instance. ""This is now a live investigation, and we are unable to discuss any operational detail."" Leave.EU was a separate campaign to the official Vote Leave organisation. The UK's referendum in June 2016 was about whether the UK should Remain or Leave the European Union. The result was that the UK voted by 51.9% to 48.1% to leave the EU.

"President Donald Trump speaks during a campaign rally to help Republican candidates running in the upcoming election US President Donald Trump says he always tries to tell the truth when he can, despite how the media portrays him. ""I do try,"" he told ABC News in an interview aired on Thursday. ""I always want to tell the truth. When I can, I tell the truth."" Mr Trump has faced repeated criticism from US media and opponents for lying and distorting the truth around issues. At times, conservatives have also censured the president for his claims. ""Sometimes it turns out to be where something happens that's different or there's a change, but I always like to be truthful,""Mr Trump told ABC's Jonathan Karl,external. The president also mentioned he was ""pretty good"" at estimating crowds during his interview, though one of the first times he clashed with the media was overthe size of his inauguration crowd. Since the start of his presidency, US media including the New York Times, Washington Post and Politifact have all kept running tallies of what they term Mr Trump's lies and misleading statements. Politifact, which is owned by the non-profit Poynter Institute, currently has 11 pages on Mr Trump's false statements. TheWashington Post says the president has made 6,420 false or misleading claims over 649 days,external. These, for instance, include repeated assertions about the opposition Democrats' stance on immigration and border controls, the origins of the Russia probe that centres on alleged collusion during the US presidential election campaign, and levels of spending by US allies of Nato. Mr Trump has not escaped criticism from conservatives either over his questionable remarks. Most recently, top Republican Paul Ryan was one of several Republicans to call into questionthe president's assertion that he could amend the constitution with an executive order. During a Wednesday rally in Florida, ahead of next week's mid-term elections, Mr Trump re-launched his assault on US media, saying a third of Americans believed that the media was ""the enemy of the people"". Why Trump attacks the media How 'enemies' remark echoes tyrants This video can not be played The US president said a third of Americans believed ""fake news"" media was ""the enemy of the people"" He did not provide a source for this figure, but one poll from earlier this year showed thatjust under a third of people agreed with the idea that the media is the enemy of the people.,external Critics accuse him of fomenting violence by using extreme and divisive rhetoric against opponents, the media, immigrants and Muslims. Mr Trump has regularly accused some sections of the media of misrepresenting his administration's work. In Julythe publisher of the New York Times urged him to stop calling reporters ""enemies of the people"", saying it would ""lead to violence"" against the media. Mr Trump's remarks come asa new NPR/PBS/Marist poll shows around 80% of voters are concerned,externalthat the lack of civility in Washington will incite violence. While the overall numbers show 40% believe the president is to blame, along party lines, the figures differ as expected. Only 7% of Republicans place the blame on the president, compared to 71% of Democrats. Republicans in turn blame Democrats, 44%, and the media, 42%. But 45% of independent voters say Mr Trump remains the chief cause of the nationwide negative tone. A young participant gestures during a campaign rally with President Donald Trump in Estero, Florida On Wednesday, Mr Trump pinned a divisive campaign ad to his Twitter account that blamed Democrats for ""letting in"" criminals. The video highlights Luis Bracamontes, an undocumented immigrant from Mexico who killed two police officers in California in 2014. It then shows images of the migrant caravan and asks: ""Who else would Democrats let in?"" Trump's immigration ad draws criticism Democrats were quick to criticise the racially-charged ad, with Democratic National Committee Chairman Tom Perez telling CNN the ad showed ""distracting, divisive Donald at his worst"". Recent days have seen the president escalate his rhetoric on immigration in an apparent effort to bolster his base with five days to go before the mid-term elections. Voters are choosing new members of Congress, but how they vote will affect how the rest of Mr Trump's presidency turns out. Both houses of Congress are currently controlled by Mr Trump's Republican Party. A really simple guide to the US mid-terms Are people being barred from voting in US? The Democrats hope to win control of the House of Representatives next week. Doing so would let them block or delay the president's agenda. Some opinion polls put the Democrats ahead in many places.

"Charlotte Caldwell previously said the law change would mean her son, Billy, would be able to live a ""normal life"" Medicinal cannabis products can now be legally prescribed to some patients across the UK for the first time. The treatments can be prescribed only by specialist doctors in a limited number of circumstances where other medicines have failed. The decision to relax the rules on the treatments followed an outcry over two boys with severe epilepsy being denied access to cannabis oil. But one charity fears access to it will be ""much more limited"" than expected. Is the UK the world's biggest exporter of legal cannabis? What are the rules about cannabis oil in the UK? Among those who stand to benefit will be children with rare, severe forms of epilepsy. This video can not be played Cannabis-derived medicines: What you need to know As of Thursday cannabis-based products can be prescribed, but only by specialist hospital doctors in a small number of cases, and not by GPs. New NHS guidance for doctors in England,externalsays it should be prescribed only when there is clear published evidence of its benefit and other treatment options have been exhausted. The treatments can be prescribed in cases of Children with rare, severe forms of epilepsy Adults with vomiting or nausea caused by chemotherapy Adults with muscle stiffness caused by multiple sclerosis If a patient is not already in touch with a specialist doctor they can be referred to one by their GP if the doctor deems this appropriate. Billy Caldwell and Alfie Dingley were granted licences to allow them access to cannabis oil The Home Office has said the treatments must have been produced for medical use and be regulated. In practice, experts say this is likely to include pills, capsules and oils, but not smoking cannabis. Treatments contain varying quantities and ratios of the compounds THC, which makes people feel ""high"", and CBD, another compound scientists are investigating for its potential medical benefits. It will be down to individual hospital trusts to decide how to fund the treatments. The decision to allow specialist doctors to prescribe medicinal cannabis products follows the high-profile cases of Alfie seven, and Billy, 13. Both have severe epilepsy which their families say has been markedly improved by cannabis oil treatments that had not been legally available in the UK. Initially, theHome Office refused requests for a licencefor Alfie to use the oil. Billy's mother, Charlotte, hadcannabis oil that she brought back from Canada confiscated at Heathrow Airport. Their plight prompted MPs tocriticise the ""bizarre and cruel"" rules over medicinal cannabis. The boys have since been granted special licences to access their treatments. The cases prompted Home Secretary Sajid Javid to announce in June that there would be a review of medicinal cannabis. That review, which came in two parts, concluded there was evidence medicinal cannabis had therapeutic benefits and that doctors should be able to prescribe the products, provided they met safety standards. In July Mr Javid confirmed that specialists doctors would be able to prescribe cannabis-derived medicinal products. Before today, almost all cannabis-based medicinal products were classed as Schedule One drugs, which means they were judged to have no therapeutic value. Sativex, a treatment containing the cannabis compounds THC and CBD, is one of the few that is already approved. This meant these products could not be legally prescribed in the UK, and could be accessed only, in rare cases, with a special licence from the Home Office. Now treatments that meet ""appropriate standards"" have been reclassified into Schedule Two - those that have a potential medical use. The government says this is not a first step towards legalisation of recreational cannabis use, as in Canada Alfie Dingley's mum, Hannah Deacon, said the guidelines meant people would struggle to access the oil her son had been given because scientific studies had not been carried out on the treatment. ""It's absolutely gutting and not what my campaign was about."" Emma Appleby, whose nine-year-old daughter, Teagan, has severe epilepsy, said it was not clear when she will receive medical cannabis. She also said the guidelines suggested Teagan would be given a weaker form of treatment than doctors had initially suggested to her. She said: ""It's heart-breaking to watch your child suffer every single day, knowing there's a product that can help, could help... ""Watching my daughter suffer every day, it's horrible."" Dr Michael Bloomfield, from University College London, said the UK's approach was sensible. ""It's going to be very hard for doctors to prescribe cannabis-related products to begin with, and I think it's right that's the case. ""When we don't have very strong evidence for any medicine, then it should be hard to prescribe something because we should be prescribing medicines when there's a very strong evidence base for them."" But the MS Society said the guidance made access to treatments ""much more limited than we were led to believe"". Genevieve Edwards, from the society, added: ""We're calling on NHS England to revisit this guidance urgently, and engage with neurological experts to ensure people with MS are not left disappointed and unable to access the right treatment for them."" The government has been quick to say that this is not a first step towards legalising cannabis. Last monthCanada became only the second country in the world, after Uruguay, to legalise possession and use of recreational cannabis. ""There will be strict controls in place and this is in no way a step towards legalising the recreational use of cannabis,"" Home Secretary Sajid Javid has previously said. An NHS spokeswoman said the change to the law ""does not detract from the wider physical and mental health risks and concerns potentially arising from regular recreational cannabis use"".
