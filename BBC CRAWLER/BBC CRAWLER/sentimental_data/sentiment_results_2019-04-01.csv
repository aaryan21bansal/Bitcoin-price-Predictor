"Lisa Dorrian was last seen alive at a County Down caravan site on 28 February 2005 A large-scale search operation is under way for Lisa Dorrian at the Ballyhalbert caravan park where she was last seen alive in 2005. The search also includes a disused airfield behind the caravan park, and will take in a number of other areas. Ms Dorrian, 25, disappeared after a party at the site and police believe the Bangor shop assistant was murdered. Police have pursued more than 3,500 lines of inquiryand carried out almost 400 searches. A fresh appeal for information about her murder was made on the BBC's Crimewatch programme last year. No-one has been charged with Ms Dorrian's killing Police have not said why they have returned to the County Down caravan park to conduct the new searches. Det Supt Jason Murphy, who is leading the investigation, said: ""The determination of the PSNI to bring those who killed Lisa Dorrian to justice is as strong today as it has ever been. ""The purpose of the search operation is two-fold: Firstly I want to recover Lisa's body and allow the Dorrian family to finally put Lisa to rest. And secondly I am looking for evidence relating to her disappearance.""

"Police remain at the scene of the fight A 47-year-old man is in a critical condition in hospital following a large-scale disturbance in Glasgow city centre after Sunday's Celtic-Rangers game. Two other men, aged 29 and 30, were seriously injured in the incident shortly after 17:00. Police cordoned off a number of streets in the Merchant City around Albion Street, Ingram Street and Bell Street. The attack on the 47-year-old man is being treated as attempted murder. It is understood that one line of inquiry is that the incident was connected to the earlier match at Celtic Park. Trouble flared at about 17:00 on Sunday Det Insp Peter Crombie said: ""We are currently going through CCTV and speaking to those who were in the area at the time to try to establish exactly what happened here. ""We are treating the attack on the 47-year-old man as attempted murder, and the attacks on the 29 and 30-year-old men as serious assaults. ""There may have been more people injured in this incident who did not seek medical treatment last night and we would appeal for them to come forward and speak to us."" He added: ""We also know that there were a number of people in the area who may have got caught up in it, or stopped to see what was going on. We would ask these people to check back and see if they have any mobile phone footage or images that can help us. ""If you were driving in the area, you may also have dash cam footage that can help - either prior to the incident taking place or in the aftermath.""

"Kanagusabi Ramanathan was found dead at the couple's flat in Burges Road, Newham A 73-year-old woman who beat her disabled husband to death with a wooden pole after suffering years of abuse has been cleared of his murder. Packiam Ramanathan attacked 76-year-old Kanagusabi Ramanathan as he lay in bed at their home in Newham, east London, on 21 September last year. The defendant told the Old Bailey she was ""in a trance"" when she hit him. She was found not guilty of murder, but had admitted manslaughter, citing his bullying during their 35-year marriage. The jury was told the couple had an arranged marriage in 1983 and fled Sri Lanka in the civil war. Mr Ramanathan was found with serious head injuries and multiple wounds to the body and neck after Packiam Ramanathan told her neighbour she had hit her husband. Giving evidence, Ramanathan said she lost control after years of abusive behaviour during which her husband had thrown sticks at her and accused her of having an affair with the fishmonger. Describing the killing, the defendant said: ""I don't know how I did it. For me I still feel like somebody else did it."" Prosecutor Sally O'Neil said the couple had argued about money and Ramanathan had become very angry at finding out her husband had written to Sri Lankan police accusing her brother of fraud and theft. However, Stephen Kamlish QC, defending, said if the 73-year-old had wanted to kill her diabetic husband she could have just given him a bigger dose of insulin. ""The fact it was done in the way it was - with a stick - means there was no planning,"" he said. The jury deliberated for half an hour to find Ramanathan not guilty of murder. She will be sentenced on Friday for manslaughter.

"Russell Bucklew argued that his medical condition would make death by lethal injection extremely painful The US Supreme Court has ruled that a convicted murderer on death row in Missouri has no right to a ""painless death"". The ruling clears the way for the execution of Russell Bucklew, who asked for gas rather than lethal injection, citing an unusual medical condition. Bucklew, 50, argued the state's preferred method amounts to legally banned ""cruel and unusual punishment"". The 5-4 ruling split along the court's ideological lines. Bucklew was sentenced to death in 1996 for rape, murder and kidnapping in an attack against his ex-girlfriend and her new partner and six-year-old son. In recent court filings, Bucklew argued that his congenital condition, cavernous hemangioma, might cause him excessive pain if he is put to death by lethal injection. US Supreme Court: (Front L-R) Stephen Breyer, Clarence Thomas, Chief Justice John Roberts, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Samuel Alito, Jr; (Back L-R) Neil Gorsuch, Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan and Brett Kavanaugh The condition causes blood-filled tumours in his throat, neck and face, which he said could rupture during his execution causing him extreme pain and suffocation. According to Bucklew, he would feel excessive pain if the state executioner is allowed to use the state's preferred method of a single drug, pentobarbital, applied by needle. But the Supreme Court's conservative justices said on Monday they considered the legal effort to be a stalling tactic. They said it was up to the prisoner to prove that another method of execution would ""reduce a substantial risk of severe pain"", but he had not done so. Writing for the majority, Justice Neil Gorsuch noted that Bucklew had been on death row for more than 20 years. ""The eighth amendment [to the US constitution] forbids 'cruel and unusual' methods of capital punishment but does not guarantee a prisoner a painless death,"" wrote Justice Gorsuch, who was appointed by President Donald Trump in 2017. He continued: ""As originally understood, the eighth amendment tolerated methods of execution, like hanging, that involved a significant risk of pain, while forbidding as cruel only those methods that intensified the death sentence by 'superadding' terror, pain or disgrace."" Liberals on the court, including Justice Stephen Breyer, argued that Bucklew's condition should have allowed for him to be put to death by nitrogen gas, a method allowed in three states. ""There are higher values than ensuring that executions run on time,"" wrote Justice Sonia Sotomayor in a separate opinion, adding that secrecy in the death penalty process has recently yielded different results in two similar cases. US inmate executed amid imam row In one case in Alabama, a Muslim man was forbidden from having an imam with him during his execution, but the court halted a similar sentence after an appeal by a Buddhist who wanted his spiritual adviser present when he was put to death. In Justice Gorsuch's majority opinion in the Bucklew case, he referred to those two cases, saying the inmate in Alabama had been given ample time to voice his complaint, but chose to do so only 15 days before he was scheduled to die.

"A digger was used in the raid in the village of Ahoghill There could be several gangs involved in the theft of cash machines in Northern Ireland, the police have said. Det Ch Insp David Henderson said eight ATMs had been stolen in seven separate incidents in 2019, along with one attempted theft. ""We are actively looking at it being several gangs involved,"" he said. He said there was no evidence paramilitaries were involved, but added that they may be taking ""some of the criminal assets"". Det Ch Insp Henderson made the comments following the latest theft, when a cash machine was stolen from outside a shop in County Antrim. A digger, which had been stolen from a nearby site, was used in the raid at the Nisa shop on Brook Street in Ahoghill. The incident happened in the early hours of Monday, and police said considerable damage was caused to the building. Shop owner Walter Millar said the machine ""will certainly be missed"" by the community but there was now a ""fear"" about replacing it after the theft. This video can not be played It's the most vulnerable who will suffers says Glyn Roberts Monday marks 30 years of Mr Millar being involved in the business. He initially thought a call about the theft was an April Fool's prank. ""From what I can tell, they've used a digger that they've taken from a building site down the road, ripped the machine out, used a people carrier with the roof cut off to get the cash machine into it and then drove away,"" he said. ""The wall of the kitchen at the back of the shop has been ripped out and there's a fair amount of damage to be done, but we won't know the extent of the damage until we get inside. ""It's been a difficult time, given the current economic climate, and things like this doesn't help at all."" Det Insp Richard Thornton said the initial call at 03:25 BST was about a digger on fire in the village. ""I want to appeal to anyone who was in the area around the time the incident and saw what happened, including anyone who saw a silver-coloured people-carrier type vehicle to call us,"" he said. Walter Millar said it was ""not what I expected to wake up to"" Last month,the PSNI announced the creation of a new team of detectives to investigate cash machine thefts, following an upsurge in the number of built-in ATMs being ripped from the walls of commercial properties by plant machinery. A DUP delegation, including party leader Arlene Foster, met Assistant Chief Constable Barbara Gray and the PSNI ATM taskforce on Monday. ""The loss of ATMs across Northern Ireland has been a devastating blow for many rural areas and particularly for the businesses who have seen such destruction of their premises,"" said Mrs Foster. Retailers have expressed concerns the attacks could force them to withdraw the service.

"Barry George was convicted of Jill Dando's murder and spent eight years in jail before being acquitted The brother of murdered BBC presenter Jill Dando has said he will find out who killed her ""no matter how long it takes"". Nigel Dando learned of his younger sister's death 20 years ago from a TV news bulletin. Barry George was convicted of her murder and spent eight years in jail before being acquitted at a retrial. Mr Dando said: ""I will eventually find answers... no matter how long it takes."" He said the unsolved case ""still leaves the questions open of who killed Jill and why"". ""At the moment these questions are still open-ended and still haven't been answered,"" he said. BBC journalist Nigel Dando said ""Jill was in the wrong place at the wrong time"" The TV presenter and newsreader was 37 when she died in April 1999. At the time, Mr Dando was working at the Bristol Post when a fellow journalist called him, saying his sister had been involved in an accident and asking whether he knew anything. As he was trying to get hold of his sister on her mobile, minutes later the news broke that she was dead. ""Back in the day we would have a bank of TV news screens and we would monitor them regularly,"" he told BBC Points West. ""One of them broke that news was coming through that Jill had been killed, that she had been found dead on her doorstep."" Ms Dando was a hugely popular star on the BBC, having presented the Six O'Clock News, Breakfast News and prime-time shows such as Holiday and Crimewatch. Her brother said he wanted to ask the killer, if he or she was ever found, why they did it. ""It's such a pointless thing to have happened,"" he said. ""I believe there was no reason, it was just an act of random brutality and Jill was in the wrong place at the wrong time."" Dando murder case 'will never be solved' Dando documentary to mark anniversary Like her brother, Ms Dando had pursued a career in journalism, having started on the local paper in her home town of Weston-super-Mare. Since her death, Jill Dando news centres have been set up to encourage more young people into journalism. The latest one to open has been at King Alfred School in Highbridge.

"A White House whistleblower has told Congress that dozens of rejected security clearance applications were overturned by the Trump administration. Tricia Newbold claimed applications that were denied for ""serious disqualifying issues"" were later reversed with little explanation. The veteran White House security adviser testified to the Democratic-led House Oversight and Reform Committee. Democrats have long claimed that White House officials have abused clearances. Ms Newbold, who works as an adjudications manager in the White House Personnel Security Office, cited ""grave"" security risks arising from the intervention of her colleagues. The White House has not commented on the testimony. Ms Newbold said she decided to speak to the panel after repeated attempts to share her concerns with superiors were ignored, adding that it was her ""last hope to really bring the integrity back to our office"", according to a committee-released transcript of her interview on Monday. ""I would not be doing a service to myself, my country, or my children if I sat back knowing that the issues that we have could impact national security,"" the 18-year veteran of the executive branch said. Ms Newbold, who has worked under both Republican and Democratic administrations, claimed that clearances ""were not always adjudicated in the best interest of national security"". The committee is investigating the background checks of Ivanka Trump and her husband Jared Kushner She added that rejections occurred due to a variety of reasons, including ""foreign influence, conflicts of interest, concerning personal conduct, financial problems, drug use, and criminal conduct"". The committee added that it is investigating the background checks of the president's daughter, Ivanka Trump, her husband Jared Kushner and National Security Advisor John Bolton. Last year, it was widely reported that President Trump forced then-chief of staff John Kelly to grant a clearance to his son-in-law Mr Kushner, who until then had been operating under an interim clearance. In her testimony, Ms Newbold also criticised the White House for ""getting out of control"" with the number of interim clearance issued, which allowed staff and aides to access classified information. Congressman Elijah Cummings, the committee chairman, said in a letter to the White House Counsel's Office on Monday that refusal to co-operate with the panel's investigation is ""now preventing the committee from obtaining the information it needs to fulfil its constitutional responsibilities"". He said the committee would vote as early as Tuesday to issue subpoenas to White House officials as part of an investigation into whether national secrets were at risk during the clearance process. Director of Personnel Security Carl Kline, who Ms Newbold claims reversed her rejections, is on the list of officials that Democrats plan to compel to testify. Democrat Elijah Cummings leads the Oversight Committee Republicans have lashed out at the security clearances investigation, calling it a ""partisan attack on the White House"". Republican Congressman and ranking member Jim Jordan described the interview with Ms Newbold as ""reckless"", adding that the committee conducted the interview over a weekend and were given ""little to no time to prepare"". ""Chairman Cummings's investigation is not about restoring integrity to the security clearance process, it is an excuse to go fishing through the personal files of dedicated public servants,"" he said, adding that one of the 25 rejected applicants who later had his background check overturned was a cleaner for the government's General Services Administration. Analysis by Tara McKelvey, BBC White Housereporter From day one, clearances have been a problem for the Trump White House. During the campaign, the president promised to ""drain the swamp"" and brought in a slew of people who had never before worked in the West Wing. As a result, the process of obtaining clearances took longer than usual, and in some cases protocol may have been breached. As then-Chief of Staff John Kelly told me last spring, he discovered that ""a couple of spreadsheets worth"" of background investigations on individuals were still incomplete when he started his job in 2017. Among these was an investigation of then-staff secretary Rob Porter, who was later accused of domestic abuse and forced to resign. As Porter's case shows, the decision to allow people to work in the White House without being thoroughly vetted has caused myriad problems, ones that date back to the administration's earliest days.

"This video can not be played A baby turtle was snatched by a seagull as it was being released to the sea. If you were watching Blue Planet Live on Sunday night you may have been left a bit deflated as the programme came to an end. In the final few moments, six green sea turtle hatchlings were released on to the beach, before one of them was snapped up by a hungry seagull. ""What happened and the way it played out was unfortunate,"" Blue Planet Live's executive producer Roger Webb says. ""It's not for us to interfere. ""With a predator with such quick wits and ability - they're always going to have their eyes on the prize."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Scientist Janine Ferguson released the hatchlings on Heron Island in Australia, along with presenter Liz Bonnin. The Blue Planet Live team said the green sea turtles had been rescued from their nest chamber and would have died if the scientists working on the island hadn't unearthed them for release. Liz Bonnin told viewers: ""They're left to their own devices here, to the elements, to the predators that await them and also to the ever increasing man-made threats."" Shortly after the seagull swooped in, viewers tweeted they were left ""fuming"" because the presenter didn't intervene. One tweeted: ""Watching Blue Planet Live showed us how they help the little turtles that got stuck in the nest and then let a seagull come and pinch one of them and didn't even attempt to stop it!!""

That's nature, according to the scientists, ""The hatchlings form a major part of the gulls' diet,"" Roger Webb explains. ""As cruel as it may appear, it is nature doing what nature does, and the hatchling will become important food for the growing chicks of that gull."" But some viewers argued it wasn't fair for the programme to release the hatchlings when it was light and in full view of predators. Roger says the reason they were released at that time was because the hatchlings' siblings had emerged 48 hours earlier as first light was emerging. ""We were taking those left in the nest on to the beach, mirroring the daylight situation their siblings had emerged into."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Green sea turtles can live for up to 100 years but they face many challenges if they are to make it. These include predators, plastic, poaching, pollution and fishing. It's estimated that only around one in 1,000 turtle hatchlings make it to adulthood. Sea turtles face a number of predators as they make their way to the ocean It's not the first time the BBC has been criticised over its coverage of nature. In 2013, Sir David Attenborough defended the decision to film a baby elephant dying on the programme Africa. He said he'd resolved to always be an observer rather than a participant. Last year, it was revealed that a group of penguins, trapped in a ravine, were rescued by crew members on the BBC nature series Dynasties. Allow Twitter content?

"Former Barclays traders Carlo Palombo and Colin Bermingham have been convicted of Euribor rate-rigging Two traders have been jailed after being convicted of conspiring to rig the Euribor global interest rate. Colin Bermingham, 62, and Carlo Palombo, 40, both former Barclays traders, were convicted of conspiracy to defraud. Mr Bermingham received a five year jail term, while Mr Palombo was jailed for four years. Another trader, Sisse Bohart, has been acquitted. The sentences bring to an end the biggest trial so far for rigging interest rates - in this case the Euribor benchmark used to fix the interest rates of millions of euro-denominated loans. Lisa Osofsky, director of the Serious Fraud Office, said: ""These men deliberately undermined the integrity of the financial system to line their pockets and advance the interests of their employers. ""We are committed to tracking down and bringing to justice those who defraud others and abuse the system."" Former Barclays trader guilty of Euribor rate-rigging Former traders jailed for Euribor rigging UBS Libor 'chats were company policy' Euribor is a key euro benchmark borrowing rate, underpinning about $180tn of financial products, and the accuracy of the rate is important to maintaining trust in the financial system. Every day, one trader at each bank would estimate the interest rate he or she thought the bank would have to pay to borrow cash from other banks, based on the rates banks were paying that morning. The estimates would be submitted to the European Banking Federation (EBF), based on current market transactions. Those submissions would then be averaged and a rate would be published. In the 1990s and 2000s, traders routinely requested that the submissions be tweaked up or down by tiny amounts to suit their banks' commercial interests. Banks typically had trading positions or investments that would benefit from higher or lower submissions. The traders' defence has been that this was normal commercial practice. The Serious Fraud Office (SFO) says it is corrupt. During the sentencing hearing, Judge Michael Gledhill echoed controversial remarks by Mr Justice Cooke, who presided over the first interest rate rigging trial in 2015 of former UBS trader Tom Hayes, saying he wanted ""a message sent out to the world of banking"". ""Those convicted of manipulating interest rates will face substantial custodial sentences,"" he said. Mr Hayes was sentenced to 14 years in prison,which was reduced on appealto 11 and a half years. Judge Gledhill said it was difficult to understand why Mr Bermingham had become involved in conspiracy, because there was no personal gain to him from accepting requests from traders to put in higher or lower submissions. But, he added: ""Part of the answer lies in a desire to help Barclays prosper, and perhaps it is something to do with the desire to be respected by others. Whatever the reasons, you have been convicted of being knowingly and dishonestly involved in this conspiracy."" Mr Bermingham, Mr Palombo and Ms Bohart were tried a second time by the SFO, after a jury failed to reach a majority verdict in an earlier trial in 2017. Ahead of that trial, Christian Bittar, a former Deutsche Bank trader, pleaded guilty to conspiracy to defraud. Another former Barclays trader, Philippe Moryoussef, attended earlier hearings but decided not to attend the trial, with his lawyer saying he could not be confident of a fair trial. Former Barclays trader Philippe Moryoussef, centre, was sentenced to eight years in jail in absentia He was convicted in his absence and is now a fugitive from British justice. Both Mr Palombo and Mr Bermingham were convicted by majority verdicts, with two jurors against a guilty verdict in both cases. Carlo Palombo's lawyer John Hartley said Mr Palombo and his familywere devastated by the outcome. ""Mr Palombo started at Barclays as a junior trader and was taught by his management from an early stage about making requests of the submission desk,"" said Mr Hartley in a statement. ""He gave evidence during the trial that this was an ordinary course of business at the bank and there was never an issue of any of his actions being dishonest at that time and that he had received no training on Euribor submissions. No senior members of management were on trial."" In aBBC Panorama programme ""The Big Bank Fix"" in 2017, the BBC revealed a secret recording which implicated the Bank of England in a practice called ""lowballing"". Lowballing occurred during the 2008 financial crisis, when banks artificially lowered their estimates for Libor (the London Interbank Offered Rate) - the dollar and sterling equivalent of Euribor. In a statement to the BBC, the Bank of England said Libor was unregulated at the time. At the 2016 trials, the SFO said it was investigating lowballing. However, after years of investigation, no prosecution has been mounted. Mr Hayes's case is now with the Criminal Cases Review Commission (CCRC) amid growing doubts about the safety of his conviction. The evidence against him also consisted of ""trader requests"" to put in higher or lower libor submissions. Former UBS trader Tom Hayes was jailed in 2015 for allegely rigging Libor His defence in 2015 was that there were a range of potential submissions, based on the slightly differing interest rates banks were paying to borrow money on any given morning. Requests to raise or lower it within that range were legitimate, his lawyers argued. Prosecutors dismissed the notion of a range. However, in 2017, at the trial of Barclays traders for rigging rates, John Ewan, the former Libor manager at the British Bankers Association, agreed requests for higher or lower submissions within a range could be acceptable. The two defendants in that trial, Ryan Reich and Stelios Contogoulas, were acquitted. The trial of Palombo and Bermingham heard similar evidence from Helmut Konrad, a retired banker who helped set up Euribor in 1999, who told the court in 2018 it was ""okay"" for banks to submit a rate from a number of options that were equally good, even if one rate would be more profitable for the bank. At this year's trial, he told the court ""as long as we're talking about the range of permissible rates, it's fine"". Mr Hartley said Mr Palombo was considering an appeal.

"This video can not be played Chris Leslie: 'We must fight for those who signed petition' A petition calling for the UK to stay in the EU, which has amassed more than six million signatures, has been debated in Parliament. The petition, demanding Article 50 be revoked, is the most popular since the e-petitions site launched. Two other petitions were debated in the Westminster Hall chamber. One, demanding a new referendum, has over 180,000 signatures. The other, urging MPs to ""honour the referendum result"", has more than 170,000. The government has said it will not revoke Article 50 and it is working to deliver a deal that ""ensures the UK leaves the EU"". But MP for the Independent Group, Chris Leslie, called for the debate to be moved to the Commons, not ""simply nodded through"", as is customary in Westminster Hall. He told MPs: ""It is now our duty, faced with this six million petition, to not have it pigeonholed and side-lined here in Westminster Hall, but to take those views and have that voice heard in front of the government.

The petition to revoke it was started in February and quickly passed the 100,000-signature threshold needed for it to be debated in Parliament. By 23 March, the petition had been signed four million times, at one stage causing Parliament's petition website to crash. During the debate, Labour's Catherine McKinnell said that ""no petition has received the number of signatures this petition has"". She said, while it ""doesn't replace our normal democratic processes"", it ""simply is a reflections of level of interest in this issue and strength of feeling from the public"". Ms McKinnell added: ""We ought to be very grateful that they have their means to make their voices heard. This petition is a roar."" Another MP for the Independent Group, Heidi Allen, used her contribution to call for a public vote on Brexit, saying it would be ""healing"" for the nation. ""Involving the entire country in the decision... there can be nothing more healing than that,"" she said. ""Everybody's voice is equal because that is a democracy."" But Tory MP Julian Lewis used the debate to press for the UK to leave without a deal and to go onto World Trade Organisation terms.

"MPs have been voting on four different options for the next steps in the Brexit process. Options included another referendum, seeking a customs union, staying in the single market, and potentially cancelling Brexit altogether if no deal could be agreed. None of the proposals earned a majority in the second round of so-called ""indicative votes"" to test Parliamentary support.

Data from Commons Votes Services The customs union proposal put forward by Ken Clarke came closest to securing a majority, failing by just three votes. Last Wednesday it lost by six votes. The option with the most parliamentary support was the proposal of Peter Kyle and Phil Wilson, to hold another public vote to confirm any option agreed by Parliament. It received 280 votes but had 292 against. It was supported by seven more Conservatives and five additional Labour members compared to when it was put forward by Dame Margaret Beckett last Wednesday. Nick Boles resigned the Conservative whip after his Common Market 2.0 proposal failed by 21 votes. It would have seen the UK remain in the single market and join a temporary customs union. He said that the second rejection in a week was because his party ""refuses to compromise"". More than 220 Tories voted against it both times it was put forward. Joanna Cherry's proposal would have seen Parliament given the power to avoid no-deal by cancelling Brexit if no extension was granted by the EU beyond the current 12 April deadline. It was not tabled in the last round of indicative votes and was the least popular choice on Monday, defeated by 101 votes.

"In Berlin on Sunday, demonstrators held aloft EU and UK flags - and the German word for ""friends"" The EU is closely watching the indicative votes process in the UK parliament today. EU leaders would, of course, welcome a softer Brexit. It would ease friction in post-Brexit EU-UK trade relations â but at the same time, they believe MPs are out of touch with reality. However many Brexit options are voted on today in the House of Commons, EU law stipulates that there are only three on the table: no deal, no Brexit, or Theresa May's negotiated deal. Any other form of Brexit requires the much-disliked Withdrawal Agreement - rejected once again by MPs on Friday - to be passed first. The EU is prevented by law from negotiating future trade relations with an existing member state. That is why the UK needs to leave first in order to start these negotiations. EU leaders understand the reluctance of MPs to enter into a so-called ""blind Brexit"", where you don't know what the future holds. The political declaration document, accompanying the Withdrawal Agreement, is there to give an idea of what might come next. The key word is ""might"". Chief whip attacks cabinet's Brexit strategy EU leaders plan for no deal as other options dissolve Brexit: A really simple guide Yes, if MPs unite around a softer Brexit and if Theresa May accepts that wish and communicates it to the EU, Brussels says it can amend the political declaration in a jiffy. But - and this is where the EU believing MPs are out of touch with reality really kicks in - the political declaration is just that: a declaration. It is not legally binding. The withdrawal agreement - what it all means So a future UK prime minister could opt for a very different Brexit when trade negotiations actually start. Which is probably why one of the options being put forward to be voted on today (from Conservative MP Ken Clarke) reads: ""Make it UK law to negotiate a customs union with EU"". Mr Clarke is seeking to restrict the power of the future prime minister to row back on parliament's will if MPs unite around a softer Brexit. But time is running out â again. The EU has given the UK until 10 April, when it will hold an emergency Brexit summit, to decide what next or to slip - however unintentionally - into a no-deal Brexit. On Monday, European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker said EU patience was running out. It's hardly a surprising comment, nor the first time an EU leader has said something similar. But it goes without saying that the EU wishes MPs had done their Brexit soul-searching, decision-making and recognition of impending trade-offs long before now - the 11th, 12th, or 13th hour.

"MPs have taken part in a second round of votes on alternative proposals to Theresa May's Brexit deal. None of the four options chosen by the Speaker, John Bercow, were backed outright by MPs. The first series of ""indicative votes"" on various options was first held last week, on 27 March. None of MPs' eight proposals secured a majority then either. The House of Commons is attempting to find a strategy that can gain majority support after the prime minister's plans were rejected on three occasions - so far. Proposer: Ken Clarke, Conservative Result: 273 votes for and 276 against This option commits the government to negotiating ""a permanent and comprehensive UK-wide customs union with the EU"" as part of any Brexit deal. This arrangement would give the UK a closer trading relationship with the EU and reduce the need for some (but not all) checks at the Irish border. This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics. But it would prevent the UK striking independent trade deals with other countries, and has previously been ruled out by Mrs May. A version of this proposal received the most support in the first round, falling just six votes short of a majority. Proposer: Nick Boles, Conservative Result: 261 votes for and 282 votes against This proposal would mean joining the European Free Trade Association and European Economic Area, with countries such as Norway. It means the UK would remain part of the EU single market and would retain freedom of movement, so British citizens would keep the right to live and work in the EU and vice-versa. In the last round, 188 MPs voted for this plan and 283 voted against. What is Common Market 2.0? Proposers: Peter Kyle and Phil Wilson, Labour Result: 280 votes for and 292 votes against This gives the public a vote to approve any Brexit deal passed by Parliament, before it can be implemented. Tabled last time by Labour former minister Dame Margaret Beckett, this option won the highest number of votes, with 268 MPs for and 295 against. How could another Brexit referendum work? Proposer: Joanna Cherry, Scottish National Party Result: 191 votes for and 292 votes against This option offers a series of steps to prevent the UK leaving the EU without a deal. First, it requires the government to seek an extension if a deal has not been agreed two days before the deadline for leaving. If the EU does not agree to an extension, on the day before the UK was due to leave, MPs would be asked to choose between a no-deal Brexit or revoking Article 50 to stop Brexit altogether. In the event of revoking Article 50, an inquiry would be held to find out what type of future relationship with the EU could command majority support in the UK and be acceptable to Brussels. MPs previously voted against a proposal to cancel Brexit by Joanna Cherry, but have not considered this plan before. The following four motions were rejected by Mr Bercow. Proposer: John Baron, Conservative This proposal aimed to commit the UK to leave the EU on 22 May with an amendment to Prime Minister Theresa May's withdrawal agreement. That would allow the UK to exit the so-called Irish backstop whenever it wants, without the EU's permission. The backstop is an insurance policy designed to keep an open border between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic ""under all circumstances"", if the UK and EU do not manage to agree a permanent trade relationship in time. Please upgrade your browser Use the list below or select a button Many MPs fear that it could mean the UK is tied to EU rules for years, while the Democratic Unionist Party has voted against it because it would mean Northern Ireland was treated differently from the rest of the UK. This was a new motion, which was not considered by MPs on 27 March. But the EU has said that the backstop is not up for renegotiation. New ideas for the Brexit border backstop Proposer: John Baron, Conservative This motion asked MPs to support the UK leaving the EU without a deal on 12 April, if they have not agreed to support the prime minister's withdrawal agreement by then. If the UK did leave the EU with no deal, it would mean initially trading on World Trade Organisation (WTO) terms, which could mean tariffs on certain goods and extra checks on UK goods entering the EU. On 27 March, a similar motion was backed by 160 MPs, but opposed by 400. What is the 'no deal' WTO option? Brexit: What trade deals have been done so far? What is operation Yellowhammer? Proposers: Graham Jones, Labour, and Dominic Grieve, Conservative This was another proposal for the public to vote on the future of Brexit, but in this case it would only happen if the UK was otherwise going to leave the EU without a deal. MPs have not voted on this motion before. Proposer: George Eustice, Conservative This motion proposes that the UK rejoins the European Free Trade Association as soon as possible, meaning the UK stays in the single market. It also requires negotiations with the EU over ""additional protocols"" to resolve the issue of the Irish border and agri-food trade. Brexit: What happens next?

"Brexit isn't a moment or a single day. It's a long-term process. And that begs the question: where is the UK likely to end up? When people talk about a ""soft Brexit"" they are usually referring to the kind of economic relationship the UK will have with the EU in the future. And most of the debate revolves around two things: membership of a customs union and membership of the EU single market. Being in a customs union means there are no tariffs (or import taxes) on goods traded between two countries or trade blocs, and no other customs infrastructure. Once goods arriving from other countries have crossed the external border of a customs union, they can then move around freely without any further customs checks or payments. For companies that operate in European markets that is a huge benefit. It helps protect their complex supply chains, which often see parts cross borders several times during the manufacturing process. But the removal of internal tariffs also means members of a customs union have to apply the same external tariff to goods arriving from the rest of the world. And, after Brexit, that would limit the UK's ability to pursue a fully independent trade policy, breaking one of Theresa May's red lines. This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics. The UK wouldn't be able to sign separate trade agreements on goods, but it would still be able to do deals in the service sector (there are no tariffs on services). The other thing worth remembering about a customs union proposal is that - on its own - it wouldn't meet the test of avoiding a hard border in Ireland ""under all circumstances"". It would help, but there are other checks that need to take place at borders that have nothing to do with customs. So a customs union alone also wouldn't guarantee that trade between Dover and Calais, an economic lifeline for the UK, would be as open as it is now. This is the other main building block for the UK's current economic life inside the EU. Being in the EU single market means all the rules that govern the economy are the same. That can be anything from regulations on chemicals or pharmaceuticals, to the rules on food safety and animal welfare. Staying in the single market would mean all those rules stay the same - and the UK would have to continue to respect the EU's four freedoms. That's the free movement of goods, services, capital and people. So it would be good news for the service sector, which makes up about three-quarters of the UK economy. This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics. But the reddest of the prime minister's red lines is probably her determination to end the free movement of people from the EU. Staying in the single market (but outside the EU) would mean that isn't possible. There are circumstances in which you can limit free movement if there is a sudden surge of arrivals, but it's fairly limited and not automatic. Some MPs want to combine single market membership with some sort of customs arrangement that would be a customs union in all but name. This is the proposal known as Common Market 2.0 and is probably the softest form of Brexit being debated. It would resolve problems at the Irish border. One of the big differences from the UK's current status is that it would no longer have to be part of the EU's common fishing and agriculture policies. But critics argue that if you're staying in the single market and in a close customs partnership, there's not much point in leaving the EU in the first place. More about Common Market 2.0 There are of course plenty of Conservative MPs who would prefer to leave with no deal than any of the options outlined above. Initially, trading would be done on World Trade Organization (WTO) terms - which would mean some goods would be subject to tariffs. The UK would also lose all the trade deals it is currently part of as an EU member - although the government is currently trying to replicate these ""as far as possible"". In addition to tariffs, there would be extra checks at the external border of the single market - which could lead to bottlenecks at some ports (such as Dover). But even if you leave with no deal, you still need to negotiate a future relationship. No-one is advocating cutting trade links with the EU altogether. Most no-deal Conservatives want to end up in a free trade agreement with the EU, similar to the one negotiated in the last few years between the EU and Canada. They argue that because the UK will be a much more important trading partner for the EU, it can get a much better deal than Canada. That would get rid of most tariffs on goods, but it wouldn't deal with other aspects of customs such as rules of origin, which mean companies have to prove where all the parts in their products have come from. That can be a time-consuming and expensive business. Some Brexiters favour a future relationship based on the EU-Canada free trade deal A free trade agreement is a much looser economic partnership than membership of the single market and the customs union, or of any combination of the two. It would allow the UK to regain more sovereignty over the economic decisions it has to make, but it would make trading with the EU, its largest single partner, more difficult. Nearly three years after the Brexit referendum, these are the choices that MPs are still struggling with. What is the 'no deal' WTO option? What is operation Yellowhammer?

"Violent crime is an issue that cannot be solved solely by increasing police powers, Theresa May has warned. Speaking at the start of a youth violence summit at Downing Street, the prime minister said the issue needed a ""great cooperated long-term effort"" from numerous bodies. ""We cannot simply arrest ourselves out of this problem,"" she added. The summit comes after the Home Office announced proposals for teachers and NHS workers to help tackle youth crime. Unions are resisting the plans, and say making teachers and nurses responsible for spotting and reporting youth violence is impractical, and could make the problem worse. The  youth violence summit, which focuses on England and Wales, will involve more than 100 experts, including Met Police Commissioner Cressida Dick and Baroness Newlove, the victims' commissioner for England and Wales. Opening the event, the PM said: ""In recent months we've seen appalling number of young lives cut short or devastated by serious violence crime including a number of horrifying incidents this weekend. ""In many cases the perpetrators of these crimes are as young as their victims and this is something that has to be of deep concern to us all."" Theprime minister has previously faced criticismafter insisting there was ""no direct correlation"" between police cuts and a rise in violent crime. Plans for teachers to tackle youth crime Knife crime: More stop and search powers for police Surgeons who want you to touch knife crime The teenagers living in fear of knives Under the new Home Office proposals, teachers, NHS workers and police officers in England and Wales could be held accountable for failing to spot violent crime among young people. But unions for teachers and NHS staff have raised concerns that they will carry the blame if violent crime continues to rise. Dr Mary Bousted, joint general secretary of the National Education Union, said: ""Neither the blame for, or the solution to, violent crime can be laid at the door of schools or front-line hospital staff."" She said schools already had ""strong safeguarding practices in place"" and added: ""The problem is what happens after issues of concern have been identified."" The Royal College of Nursing, meanwhile, expressed concerns that obligations to report people involved in violent crime could deter people ""from seeking help for fear of being reported"". Teachers' leaders are highly sceptical about these knife crime proposals - suggesting it's a way of avoiding thornier questions such as the number of police on the streets. Heads and teachers say they don't understand how in practice schools would be held ""accountable"" for reporting those at risk of knife crime. ""It is hard to see how it would be either workable or reasonable to make teachers accountable,"" says Geoff Barton, leader of the ASCL head teachers' union. ""What sort of behaviour would they be expected to report and who would they report to?"" he says. Schools are at risk of getting caught in a blame-game over knife crime, says Chris Keates, leader of the NASUWT teachers' union, who warns of teachers being ""scapegoated"". If teachers were to face sanctions over spotting those at risk, she says it would create a ""culture of defensive reporting"", in which the police and social services would be swamped by referrals. The government says its plan is intended to ""help spot the warning signs that a young person could be in danger, such as presenting in A&E with suspicious injury, to worrying behaviour at school or issues at home"". Home Secretary Sajid Javid said: ""The public health, multi-agency approach has a proven track record and I'm confident that making it a legal duty will help stop this senseless violence and create long-term change."" Majella Fergus, 53, a biology teacher at a secondary school in Cumbria, told the BBC that in recent years both the government and parents had tried to transfer their responsibilities ""onto the shoulders of teachers"". ""Adding yet another non-teaching responsibility to the shoulders of strained teachers and squashed teaching time grinds us down further,"" she said. ""Knife crime is a much wider societal issue and it isn't just simply going to be fought by teachers."" Majella Fergus told the BBC she felt the government was trying to shirk its responsibilities With 285 deaths from stabbings in 2017-18, the most ever recorded in the UK,ministers have come under increasing pressure to tackle knife crime. As well as hosting the summit on youth violence in England and Wales, Mrs May will meet privately with families affected by knife crime.

"Jon Snow is the longest-running presenter of Channel 4 News More than 2,000 people have complained after Channel 4 presenter Jon Snow said of a pro-Brexit rally that he had ""never seen so many white people"". Media watchdog Ofcom said it had received 2,025 complaints and was deciding whether to investigate. The Channel 4 News anchor made the comment when he was signing off from Friday evening's live bulletin. A spokeswoman said it was ""an unscripted observation"", and said Channel 4 News regretted any offence. Snow was speaking as pictures showed protesters in Westminster afterMPs had rejected Prime Minister Theresa May's EU withdrawal agreementon the day the UK was due to leave the EU. Snow told viewers: ""It's been the most extraordinary day. A day which has seen... I have never seen so many white people in one place, it's an extraordinary story. This video can not be played Leave supporters have gathered outside Parliament ""There are people everywhere, there are crowds everywhere."" An Ofcom spokeswoman said: ""We are assessing these complaints against our broadcasting rules, but are yet to decide whether or not to investigate."" The remarks drew criticism from some viewers who described the comments about ""white people"" as unnecessary. In a statement, a spokeswoman for Channel 4 News said: ""This was an unscripted observation at the very end of a long week of fast-moving Brexit developments. ""Jon has covered major events such as this over a long career and this was a spontaneous comment reflecting his observation that, in a London demonstration of that size, ethnic minorities seemed to be significantly under-represented.

"In Berlin on Sunday, demonstrators held aloft EU and UK flags - and the German word for ""friends"" The EU is closely watching the indicative votes process in the UK parliament today. EU leaders would, of course, welcome a softer Brexit. It would ease friction in post-Brexit EU-UK trade relations â but at the same time, they believe MPs are out of touch with reality. However many Brexit options are voted on today in the House of Commons, EU law stipulates that there are only three on the table: no deal, no Brexit, or Theresa May's negotiated deal. Any other form of Brexit requires the much-disliked Withdrawal Agreement - rejected once again by MPs on Friday - to be passed first. The EU is prevented by law from negotiating future trade relations with an existing member state. That is why the UK needs to leave first in order to start these negotiations. EU leaders understand the reluctance of MPs to enter into a so-called ""blind Brexit"", where you don't know what the future holds. The political declaration document, accompanying the Withdrawal Agreement, is there to give an idea of what might come next. The key word is ""might"". Chief whip attacks cabinet's Brexit strategy EU leaders plan for no deal as other options dissolve Brexit: A really simple guide Yes, if MPs unite around a softer Brexit and if Theresa May accepts that wish and communicates it to the EU, Brussels says it can amend the political declaration in a jiffy. But - and this is where the EU believing MPs are out of touch with reality really kicks in - the political declaration is just that: a declaration. It is not legally binding. The withdrawal agreement - what it all means So a future UK prime minister could opt for a very different Brexit when trade negotiations actually start. Which is probably why one of the options being put forward to be voted on today (from Conservative MP Ken Clarke) reads: ""Make it UK law to negotiate a customs union with EU"". Mr Clarke is seeking to restrict the power of the future prime minister to row back on parliament's will if MPs unite around a softer Brexit. But time is running out â again. The EU has given the UK until 10 April, when it will hold an emergency Brexit summit, to decide what next or to slip - however unintentionally - into a no-deal Brexit. On Monday, European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker said EU patience was running out. It's hardly a surprising comment, nor the first time an EU leader has said something similar. But it goes without saying that the EU wishes MPs had done their Brexit soul-searching, decision-making and recognition of impending trade-offs long before now - the 11th, 12th, or 13th hour.

"Tory MP Nick Boles has proposed a motion for Common Market 2.0 MPs have voted on the possible next steps for Brexit as they try to break the deadlock in Parliament. Four options were chosen by the Speaker to be voted on, and results will be announced later. Labour MPs were urged to back a plan to keep the UK in a Norway-style relationship with the EU. Under the Common Market 2.0 proposal, the UK would leave the EU, but retain freedom of movement and make contributions to the EU budget. In a letter to MPs, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn asked them to support the motion, as well as one for a customs union, to ""break the deadlock and find the consensus necessary to force a change to the red lines of the prime minister's rejected deal"". The party have also been asked to support a motion calling for a confirmatory referendum on any deal agreed by Parliament - although some rebels may vote against it. Conservative MPs were given a free vote on the motions - meaning they were not be told by party bosses which way to go - but the cabinet was told to abstain. During the debate, 11 climate change activists staged a protest in the public gallery, taking their clothes off to reveal slogans painted on their bodies. Police were called to remove them from the viewing platform. LIVE: MPs debate Brexit options What is Common Market 2.0? What are MPs voting on? The Common Market 2.0 motion - put forward by Tory MP Nick Boles - may also be backed by the SNP. But the PM's spokesman said ending free movement was a ""very important factor"" for the public when voting for Brexit, so they would oppose it. Shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry, speaking to the BBC's World at One programme, refused to say whether Labour's position on free movement had changed. When asked if she was compromising on freedom of movement, she said ""we are trying to pull the House of Commons together"".

"Pregabalin, also known by the brand name Lyrica, is an anti-epileptic drug sometimes prescribed for chronic pain A prescription drug linked to 33 deaths in 2017 in Northern Ireland will now be treated as a class C drug. Pregabalin - also known by the brand name Lyrica, or the street name bud - is an anti-epileptic drug also used to relieve chronic pain. Northern Ireland has the highest prescription rate for pregabalin in the UK. It is illegal to have class C drugs without a prescription and illegal to supply or sell them to others. Meanwhile the mother of a man who took his own life, speaks about her son's struggle with addiction to prescription drugs. Prescription drug abuse 'wrecking lives' Life on Lyrica: A user's perspective There will also be stronger controls in place to ensure accountability and minimise the chances of pregabalin falling into the wrong hands or being stockpiled by patients. Deaths relating to the prescription drug are on the rise. In 2016 eight drug deaths were linked to Lyrica misuse - one year later that figure rose to 33. The Advisory Council for the Misuse of Drugs made the recommendation to reclassify the drug in a letter to ministers, including the then home secretary Theresa May, in January 2016. The letter cited warnings from the Health and Social Care Board (HSCB), which highlighted ""significant misuse and abuse"" of the drug. There is a growing illicit market for the drug in Northern Ireland, with many people purchasing it online from unregulated websites. It is understood that Lyrica has been coming into Northern Ireland in fairly constant levels for a number of years, along with other prescription drugs including diazepam and temazepam. Packages of the drug ordered by customers in Northern Ireland are intercepted by the National Crime Agency (NCA) and the UK Border Agency at airports in England every week, according to the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI). Class C call over abuse of 'bud' drug Grieving mother's prescription drug warning While the drugs are referred to as prescription drugs, they are largely not being prescribed through community pharmacies. They are illicitly bought or sold and supplied through the internet and largely the individuals are appearing to be using a mixture of drugs. Joe Brogan, the HSCB's head of pharmacy and medicines management, described the growing numbers of deaths associated with pregabalin and other prescription drugs as a ""scourge"". He added: ""In many cases of pregabalin misuse, it has not been prescribed - it has been sourced through family or friends or bought on the street or via the internet. ""Many such drugs that are bought from illicit sources do not actually contain medicines that they purport to be. ""Any medicine or any drug can be a poison - it all depends on three things: Where you get it from - was it prescribed and supplied from a regulated source?; how much you take - was it taken within accepted dosages?; what you take it with - mixing drugs together and with alcohol can create a toxic mix that is lethal.""

"This video can not be played What is in the books that Parkfield parents are protesting about? Head teachers involved in a row over primary school LGBT rights classes say they ""feel alone"" and unsupported. Parents, mostly of Muslim faith, have protested outside Parkfield Community School in Birmingham arguing their children should not learn about same-sex relationships. More than 85 heads met with Department for Education (DfE) officials and the council in Birmingham on Friday. The DfE said the schools can teach LGBT content but do not have to. The No Outsiders project was halted at Parkfield Community School after demonstrations by some parents who said they believed the subject was ""undermining parental rights and authority"". Deputy head teacher Andrew Moffat, who devised the programme,has said it was not about sex education but ""community cohesion""and ""people getting along"". The lessons were halted as the protests at Parkfield School continued The private meeting on Friday, which lasted more than two hours, included DfE officials, Ofsted, Birmingham City Council and members of the National Association of Head Teachers (NAHT). Head teachers who spoke after the meeting expressed their frustration over a lack of clarity and support for equality teaching. One head, who wanted to remain anonymous, said: ""We feel completely alone here and feel as if we're getting no overt support whatsoever from the government. ""There was so much anger in the room and tears."" Parkfield Community School has said it was ""simply teaching children about different families"" NAHT national secretary Rob Kelsall tweeted soon after the meeting: ""DfE guidance on relationships and sex education still inadequate and open to interpretation. ""Government need to step up and sort this out. School leaders are legally bound and morally driven to teach and promote equality."" The Equality Act 2010 aims to protect people from discrimination in the workplace and applies to schools and academies. It states disadvantages suffered by people connected to a particular characteristic - disabled pupils, or gay pupils who are subjected to homophobic bullying - should be removed or minimised. Protestors have gathered over several weeks At the meeting there was an overwhelming call from head teachers in the room for the government to be clearer in its guidance as to how equality should be taught in the classroom. There were also demands for officials to put out a statement in support of the teachers. LGBT people 'never felt more vulnerable' Latest news from the West Midlands LGBT row school staff 'distraught' Sarah Hewitt-Clarkson, head teacher of Anderton Primary school in Birmingham, told the BBC: ""Not only have central government been silent about all this, but the info they've put out is contradictory. ""Equality is non-negotiable and by not being clear, they're fudging it [equality] and not giving us their backing."" For more than two months, hundreds of parents have protested against children from the age of four being read cartoon books which tell stories about same-sex relationships. The row has spread nationwide, with parents in the north and south of England making the case for their children not to be taught about same sex couples because of their religious beliefs.

"This video can not be played BBC Middle East Editor on bowel cancer diagnosis BBC Middle East editor Jeremy Bowen has revealed he has been diagnosed with bowel cancer. The former BBC Breakfast host said he was undergoing chemotherapy after noticing ""funny pains in my legs and in my back"" whilst in Iraq last May. April is bowel cancer awareness month and Bowen shared his diagnosis to encourage others to get tested. Bowel cancerscreening in England and Wales is to start earlier, at age 50, bringing them in line with Scotland. Alagiah 'overwhelmed' by viewers' support Half of over 60s 'ignore bowel screening' Health screening 'not meeting targets' Doctors initially believed the veteran journalist's pain was due to scarring from previous surgery, he told BBC Breakfast, the show which he presented alongside Sophie Raworth between 2000 and 2002. ""I had no symptoms - none of the classic bowel cancer symptoms. Nothing at all. But I thought I should get a test,"" the 59-year-old said. Jeremy Bowen and Sophie Raworth on BBC Breakfast in 2000 Bowen said he received a positive result and had a colonoscopy - a camera inserted into his colon to look for signs of cancer. ""It [the colonoscopy] is not nearly as bad as it sounds - they give you lots of drugs,"" he said. Surgeons found a tumour, which they removed, and he started chemotherapy, he said. Bowen, born in Cardiff, and a BBC journalist for 35 years, said his diagnosis ""could have been earlier, but had it been later it would have been much more serious"". Bowel cancer is the fourth most common cancer in the UK, with 42,000 people diagnosed every year. 'I can't die yet, I'm only 29' Stephen Fry recovering from cancer op More than 16,000 people die from the disease in the country annually, according toBowel Cancer UK,external. In England, Wales and Northern Ireland, people between the ages of 60 and 75 are invited to be screened for bowel cancer every two years. In Scotland, screening starts at age 50. Following recommendations from experts, NHS England and NHS Wales last year said they would start screening at the earlier age of 50. But, according to Bowel Cancer UK, a firm date for the change has not yet been set. The chief executive of the charity, Deborah Alsina, told BBC Breakfast that Bowen would have been tested at least three times by the time he was diagnosed, if the standard screening age had been 50. Bowen said: ""The key thing is - get tested. I've been saying to all my friends - get tested. ""Things to do with your bowels and poo ... are not things people normally want to talk about. But actually it's part of all our lives and you need to work on it."" He said a gastroenterologist had told him: ""Don't die of embarrassment, for God's sake."" bleeding from your bottom and/or blood in your poo a persistent and unexplained change in bowel habit unexplained weight loss extreme tiredness for no obvious reason a pain or lump in your tummy Bowen said the chemotherapy ""is not nearly as bad as I thought it would be in terms of side effects, but it affects people differently and I think I've just been quite lucky to tolerate it better than I expected"". ""You've got to keep positive about things in life. It's all part of the journey, as they say on Strictly [Come Dancing],"" he added.

"Zakariyya Elogbani (r), pictured with fellow former Westminster student, Ishak Mostefaoui, now also detained in Syria An Islamic State fighter held in Syria has told the BBC he was one of at least seven students and ex-students from University of Westminster to join IS. Zakariyya Elogbani abandoned a degree in business management which he was taking at the university in 2014. Another student had been studying while on a terror protection order which was made less restrictive by a judge, a BBC investigation has found. University of Westminster says it takes its safeguarding duty ""very seriously"". This is not the first time that students at the university have been linked to violent jihadism - the notorious IS killer Mohammed Emwazi, known as Jihadi John, studied there until 2009. The BBC's investigation now exposes the secret funnelling of fighters and funds from the UK to IS in Syria. This video can not be played British IS fighters emerge after defeat Elogbani, who grew up in east London, was captured by Kurdish forces in Syria nine months ago. Speaking to the BBC's Middle East Correspondent Quentin Sommerville, Elogbani said: ""Obviously we came here intending to fight. That's the honest truth. But I don't think it was a love for blood."" He said there was a group at University of Westminster who had already left for Syria before he even began his studies. ""They kind of opened the way,"" he added. Mohammed Emwazi appeared in videos in which he killed Western hostages That may have been a reference to Mohammed Emwazi, who studied information systems at the university and left for Syria in 2013. He became infamous after appearing in videos in which he killed Western hostages. Emwazi died in a missile strike in November 2015. Elogbani denied knowing him but admitted seeing another of the British kidnap gang, known as The Beatles, in Syria. Another former University of Westminster student who went to Syria was Akram Sabah, a recruitment consultant who left the university in 2011 with a degree in biomedical sciences. He and his older brother Mohammed were killed in fighting in September 2013. Akram Sabah (r), pictured with his brother Mohammed, finished his Westminster University degree in 2011 The BBC investigation reveals that Elogbani travelled with fellow Westminster student Ishak Mostefaoui. His Algerian family had settled in London when Mostefaoui was five. He was a popular, football-loving boy, brought up in a home that was opposed to extremism but his father, Abderrahmane, told the BBC that his son changed in 2013. He believes his son was radicalised by people at University of Westminster. In April 2014 Mostefaoui told his father that he was going to Amsterdam for a few days, leaving with just a small bag. The family did not hear from him for a month when he called to say he was in Syria. His father says he collapsed when he heard the news. Around five months ago, Mostefaoui had his British citizenship revoked. Two months later he was badly injured when his house was bombed in an attack in which his wife and young son were killed. He is currently in detention. Who were the Islamic State group 'Beatles' cell? 'Jihadi John' death: Islamic State says Mohammed Emwazi killed Elogbani says another three fellow students left around the same time as him and have since been killed. He claims one, Ibrahim, was killed in the siege of Raqqa, while Abu Talha ""died in the desert of Anbar"" and Abu Ubaydah was killed in Tikrit, Iraq. The BBC has not been able to establish all of their identities but one of them was Qasim Abukar, a hardened jihadist who previously fought with a militant group in Somalia. Abukar became a student at University of Westminster in September 2012. He played a key role in radicalising Elogbani, according to friends who have spoken to the BBC but do not wish to be identified. Abukar had been known to security services for years. MI5 had warned that allowing Qasim Abukar more contact with fellow students would increase the risk he posed He absconded from Britain to Somalia during a trial in 2009, in which he was accused of attempting to travel to Afghanistan for terrorism. He was acquitted in his absence. A separate High Court appeal heard that in Somalia, Abukar was ""involved in fighting"" alongside the militant group al-Shabaab and tried to recruit fighters in the UK for overseas operations. The court was told he was ""potentially involved in attack planning"" against Western interests. In 2011, after a period in custody in Somalia, he returned to the UK claiming he had been mistreated with the knowledge of the British state. He was placed on a control order and a Terrorism Prevention and Investigation Measure, or TPIM, to restrict his movements. TPIMs can be imposed on terror suspects, who officials decide can neither be charged nor deported, but who are nevertheless assessed to be potentially involved in terrorist-related activities. Despite being described in court as having played a ""substantial role"" in his extremist network, Abukar began studying at University of Westminster a year later. Because he had ""a track record of absconding"", he had to report daily to a local police station and wear an electronic tag. But in April 2013 he won an appeal to reduce one of the restrictions on his movements when a High Court judge permitted him to interact more with fellow students, despite warnings from MI5 that it would mean ""the risk of him engaging in terrorism-related activity"". This was in the period during which people close to Elogbani and Mostefaoui noticed their views were becoming extreme. They have told the BBC that Abukar was one of the people involved in radicalising them. Another key extremist at University of Westminster was Abukar's brother Makhzumi. He is serving a seven-year jail term after pleading guilty in 2016 to a million-pound fraud to steal the savings of pensioners. The scheme was uncovered by Scotland Yard's Counter Terrorism Command, who suspected the money was being funnelled to extremists in Syria. Court documents, seen by the BBC, reveal that when his home was searched in July 2014, only weeks after Elogbani and Mostefaoui had left the UK, notes found in his jacket recorded a series of financial transfers to a town on the Turkish/Syrian border known as ISIS International, because of its popularity as a handover point for foreign jihadists. Makhzumi Abukar was jailed for seven years after pleading guilty in 2016 to a million-pound fraud BBC News has learned of another student, Mohamed Jakir, who was killed in Syria. He was reportedly studying law at Westminster University but BBC News has not been able to confirm that. If true, it would take the overall number of fighters from the university to at least eight. Jakir was killed in 2014, seven weeks after crossing into Syria. A University of Westminster spokesperson told the BBC that the university ""has a strong pastoral and interfaith focus providing care and support to its community of 20,000 students from more than 150 countries"". In 2015 it commissioned an independent report after details emerged that Emwazi had been a student there. Fiyaz Mughal, one of the authors of that report, told the BBC: ""The university failed to understand its duty of care around confronting and countering extremist views. ""But more importantly it didn't even understand its duty of care and didn't understand the concept of things like Islamism and extremism."" Mughal was concerned that the Islamic Society at the university, in which Elogbani was active, was ""allowed to run its own fiefdom"" where women and LGBT students were treated with hostility. The BBC has spoken to former members of the university's Islamic Society, who deny that there was a culture of extremism. University of Westminster says it has a strong pastoral and interfaith ethos Meanwhile Elogbani, stripped of his British citizenship, waits to find out his fate. He cuts a forlorn figure in detention in Syria, having lost his legs in what he says was a missile attack in 2015. His is a cautionary tale of the price paid for supporting Islamic State. ""I committed a crime by coming here,"" he said. ""I guess I need to be punished."" He had a warning for other people, who, like him, may be attracted to extremism. ""Anyone that's still immersed by Islamic State methodology is wrong. ""It's a gang. A lot of people are tricked. Don't fall into the same trick."" In a statement, the Home Office said it did not comment on individual cases but pointed out that TPIMs provide some of the most restrictive measures available in the democratic world.

"In Berlin on Sunday, demonstrators held aloft EU and UK flags - and the German word for ""friends"" The EU is closely watching the indicative votes process in the UK parliament today. EU leaders would, of course, welcome a softer Brexit. It would ease friction in post-Brexit EU-UK trade relations â but at the same time, they believe MPs are out of touch with reality. However many Brexit options are voted on today in the House of Commons, EU law stipulates that there are only three on the table: no deal, no Brexit, or Theresa May's negotiated deal. Any other form of Brexit requires the much-disliked Withdrawal Agreement - rejected once again by MPs on Friday - to be passed first. The EU is prevented by law from negotiating future trade relations with an existing member state. That is why the UK needs to leave first in order to start these negotiations. EU leaders understand the reluctance of MPs to enter into a so-called ""blind Brexit"", where you don't know what the future holds. The political declaration document, accompanying the Withdrawal Agreement, is there to give an idea of what might come next. The key word is ""might"". Chief whip attacks cabinet's Brexit strategy EU leaders plan for no deal as other options dissolve Brexit: A really simple guide Yes, if MPs unite around a softer Brexit and if Theresa May accepts that wish and communicates it to the EU, Brussels says it can amend the political declaration in a jiffy. But - and this is where the EU believing MPs are out of touch with reality really kicks in - the political declaration is just that: a declaration. It is not legally binding. The withdrawal agreement - what it all means So a future UK prime minister could opt for a very different Brexit when trade negotiations actually start. Which is probably why one of the options being put forward to be voted on today (from Conservative MP Ken Clarke) reads: ""Make it UK law to negotiate a customs union with EU"". Mr Clarke is seeking to restrict the power of the future prime minister to row back on parliament's will if MPs unite around a softer Brexit. But time is running out â again. The EU has given the UK until 10 April, when it will hold an emergency Brexit summit, to decide what next or to slip - however unintentionally - into a no-deal Brexit. On Monday, European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker said EU patience was running out. It's hardly a surprising comment, nor the first time an EU leader has said something similar. But it goes without saying that the EU wishes MPs had done their Brexit soul-searching, decision-making and recognition of impending trade-offs long before now - the 11th, 12th, or 13th hour.

"Tory MP Nick Boles has proposed a motion for Common Market 2.0 MPs have voted on the possible next steps for Brexit as they try to break the deadlock in Parliament. Four options were chosen by the Speaker to be voted on, and results will be announced later. Labour MPs were urged to back a plan to keep the UK in a Norway-style relationship with the EU. Under the Common Market 2.0 proposal, the UK would leave the EU, but retain freedom of movement and make contributions to the EU budget. In a letter to MPs, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn asked them to support the motion, as well as one for a customs union, to ""break the deadlock and find the consensus necessary to force a change to the red lines of the prime minister's rejected deal"". The party have also been asked to support a motion calling for a confirmatory referendum on any deal agreed by Parliament - although some rebels may vote against it. Conservative MPs were given a free vote on the motions - meaning they were not be told by party bosses which way to go - but the cabinet was told to abstain. During the debate, 11 climate change activists staged a protest in the public gallery, taking their clothes off to reveal slogans painted on their bodies. Police were called to remove them from the viewing platform. LIVE: MPs debate Brexit options What is Common Market 2.0? What are MPs voting on? The Common Market 2.0 motion - put forward by Tory MP Nick Boles - may also be backed by the SNP. But the PM's spokesman said ending free movement was a ""very important factor"" for the public when voting for Brexit, so they would oppose it. Shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry, speaking to the BBC's World at One programme, refused to say whether Labour's position on free movement had changed. When asked if she was compromising on freedom of movement, she said ""we are trying to pull the House of Commons together"". None of today's votes on the proposals are legally binding, meaning it will be up to the government if they act on the results. Please upgrade your browser Use the list below or select a button Theresa May tried to get MPs to back the withdrawal agreement element of her deal on Friday, but lost by 58 votes - having already failed twice to get support for her overall deal in Parliament. She now has until 12 April to either seek a longer extension to the deadline or decide to leave the EU without a deal. The cabinet is now split over whether to move to a softer deal that could mean including a customs union in her plan. International Trade Secretary Liam Fox told the BBC joining a customs union would be a ""betrayal of Brexit"". The Speaker John Bercow picked four of the eight amendments put forward for debate: Motion C:Committing the government to negotiating ""a permanent and comprehensive UK-wide customs union with the EU"" as part of any Brexit deal - proposed by Tory former chancellor Ken Clarke Motion D:Referred to as Common Market 2.0, this option would mean joining the European Free Trade Association and European Economic Area - proposed by Tory MP Nick Boles Motion E:This is for a confirmatory referendum, giving the public a vote to approve any Brexit deal passed by Parliament before it can be implemented - proposed by Labour MPs Peter Kyle and Phil Wilson Motion G:The motion aims to prevent the UK leaving without a deal, including a vote on whether to revoke Article 50 - stopping Brexit - if the EU does not agree to an extension - proposed by the SNP's Joanna Cherry He did not choose motions calling for a unilateral exit to the backstop, to leave on 12 April without a deal, to hold a referendum in the case of no-deal or to rejoin the European Free Trade Association. You can read more about the proposals here. MPs have voted on the proposals and were given a piece of paper listing all the options and tick ""yes"" or ""no"" on as many as they want. The House is now suspended as MPs await the result of the vote. It took two hours for the votes to be counted before. When MPs voted on proposals last week, all eight failed to win a majority in the Commons. However, the plan for a customs union - allowing UK businesses to move goods around the EU without tariffs, but stopping the UK striking independent trade deals - and a confirmatory referendum came the closest. This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics. A number of cabinet ministers have spoken out against the customs union proposal. Mr Fox said that if the UK pursued it, the country would have to follow rules set by the EU, adding: ""It's time we went back to a proper Brexit."" Environment Secretary Michael Gove said a customs union would ""compromise"" pledges the party made in their 2017 manifesto, while Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson said ministers were ""determined"" to avoid that happening. Meanwhile, Tory MP Huw Merriman has written to around 200 of his colleagues who have voted in favour of Mrs May's deal, appealing for them to back the confirmatory referendum motion to prevent the customs union option succeeding. He said: ""It is the only option which keeps the [PM's] deal alive and is not contingent on more EU negotiations."" Digital Minister Margot James also told BBC Two's Politics Live that she is thinking about changing her mind to back a confirmatory referendum. Labour's Dame Margaret Beckett, who proposed the previous motion for a confirmatory public vote, said she was happy to vote for motions like a customs union, so it could attract scrutiny. ""But they're unlikely to command a stable majority in Parliament unless they are attached to much longer extension that allows enough time for them to be properly scrutinised and negotiated - while not precluding a new public vote,"" she said.

"London Liverpool Street was among the stations to make their toilets free to use from Monday Ever been caught short at a station scrambling for coins to pay for the toilet? Now passengers at the UK's busiest railway stations will be able to spend a penny for free - after Network Rail scrapped charges. On Monday, London Liverpool Street, London King's Cross and Edinburgh Waverley became the last of its 20 stations to make their toilets free. Previously, some charged up to 50p per person. Network Rail said it wanted to put ""passengers first"" and help make their journeys ""a bit more hassle-free"". In 2017it was revealedthat the public sector body had made Â£41m in 10 years from toilet charges. The latest figuresshow Network Rail-run stations across the UK made Â£3.1m from toilet charges in 2017-18. Where have all the public toilets gone? Paralympian wins train toilet payout Independent watchdog Transport Focus said toilets were a ""priority for improvement"" at stations according to its research. It said scrapping charges was ""a welcome step for passengers"". Ben Macfarlane says making station toilets free will help reduce the stress of travelling Ben Macfarlane, 39, was diagnosed with Crohn's disease - a chronic condition which causes inflammation in parts of the digestive system disease - 20 years ago. His condition means he often needs to use the toilet at short notice and he said charges at stations had caused him a lot of stress in the past. ""I used to panic when at the station and always have to check and make sure I had enough money and even the correct change,"" he said. ""There have been times in the past when I have had to ask for change, and when you're desperate to go the last thing you need is to be stopping to ask someone for change to use the toilet. ""As I look fit and well, people question you when you say you need to use the toilet but don't have the change,"" he added. He said scrapping charges would mean he could go to the toilet without being asked any questions, which he said could cause ""added embarrassment"". Other stations run by Network Rail - including Birmingham New Street, Manchester Piccadilly and Glasgow Central - have already scrapped toilet charges. Smaller stations managed by local train operating companies may still charge for the use of facilities. Network Rail said the move was one of a number of measures to help passengers. Other improvements being made at stations include the introduction of water fountains, better and more seating, and reducing clutter on concourses.

"Tory MP Nick Boles has proposed a motion for Common Market 2.0 MPs have voted on the possible next steps for Brexit as they try to break the deadlock in Parliament. Four options were chosen by the Speaker to be voted on, and results will be announced later. Labour MPs were urged to back a plan to keep the UK in a Norway-style relationship with the EU. Under the Common Market 2.0 proposal, the UK would leave the EU, but retain freedom of movement and make contributions to the EU budget. In a letter to MPs, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn asked them to support the motion, as well as one for a customs union, to ""break the deadlock and find the consensus necessary to force a change to the red lines of the prime minister's rejected deal"". The party have also been asked to support a motion calling for a confirmatory referendum on any deal agreed by Parliament - although some rebels may vote against it. Conservative MPs were given a free vote on the motions - meaning they were not be told by party bosses which way to go - but the cabinet was told to abstain. During the debate, 11 climate change activists staged a protest in the public gallery, taking their clothes off to reveal slogans painted on their bodies. Police were called to remove them from the viewing platform. LIVE: MPs debate Brexit options What is Common Market 2.0? What are MPs voting on? The Common Market 2.0 motion - put forward by Tory MP Nick Boles - may also be backed by the SNP. But the PM's spokesman said ending free movement was a ""very important factor"" for the public when voting for Brexit, so they would oppose it. Shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry, speaking to the BBC's World at One programme, refused to say whether Labour's position on free movement had changed. When asked if she was compromising on freedom of movement, she said ""we are trying to pull the House of Commons together"". None of today's votes on the proposals are legally binding, meaning it will be up to the government if they act on the results.

"Terry Maher spent more than 12 hours protesting on the roof A Brexit supporter has admitted staging a protest which disrupted services out of St Pancras on the day the UK was due to leave the EU. Terry Maher, from Camden, north London, caused eight Eurostar services to be cancelled during a 12 hour stand-off with police that began on Friday night. Westminster Magistrates' Court heard the 44-year-old told police he was angry with politicians over Brexit. He was remanded in custody after he admitted causing a public nuisance. The court was told Maher climbed on to a roof soon after 19:00 GMT claiming to be armed with a Stanley knife and was not brought down until the following morning. A National Rail statement described the building that he scaled as a railway viaduct that crosses the high-speed lines just outside St Pancras. As well as halting Eurostar services, Southeastern Trains was forced to cancel 16 services and part-cancel 44 others. A further 28 services were also delayed. Up to 8,000 people were estimated to have been affected by Maher's actions Prosecutor Robert Simpson said Maher's actions caused delays for between 7,000 and 8,000 people. ""There was a total of 1,757 minutes of lost time as a result of it and the estimation is that there will be in excess of Â£40,000 in delay fines,"" he said. The court heard that following his arrest, Maher had told police he ""disliked politicians"" because they were messing up Brexit. Brexit: What happens next? How could Brexit be delayed? MPs reject May's EU withdrawal agreement He also made ""various other comments about illegal immigrants in the country"" and complained about foreign aid money being spent in India, Mr Simpson said. District Judge Richard Blake said the protest was ""very serious indeed"" and had ""cost many thousands of pounds"". ""I should think untold members of the public had their weekends spoiled,"" he said.

""Consumers [are] increasingly getting their fix of celeb news and gossip from other sources that can break stories immediately,"" she said. The celebsnow.co.uk website will continue.

By BBC Music reporter Mark Savage ""Out the garage is how you end up in charge/It's how you end up in penthouses, end up in cars/With sweat drippin' down your face 'cause the mission was hard."" - Nipsey Hussle, Last Time That I Checc'd In music as in life, Nipsey Hussle stressed the importance of independence and economic mobility. He took 10 years to release his debut album, Victory Lap, rejecting major label cash to build his own empire one dollar at a time. Famously, he sold 1,000 copies of his 2013 Crenshaw mixtape for $100 - even persuading Jay-Z to buy 100 copies - giving him the financial security he needed to pursue music on his own terms. That music was heavily indebted to the West Coast rap he grew up with in the Crenshaw neighbourhood of Los Angeles, from where he embarked on his journey from the streets to the major league. Hussle never hid the fact he'd been a long-time member of LA's notorious Rollin' 60s Crips, but his croaky-voiced raps about shoot-outs and drug deals were always haunted by the ghosts of those who got left behind. On one of Victory Lap's stand-out tracks, Dedication, Kendrick Lamar urged people to look beyond Hussle's gang days, stressing: ""He a man first, you hear the words out his lips/about flourishing from the streets to black businesses?"" It was a perfect encapsulation of the musician's mission statement. ""Me being a human comes before me being an artist,""he told Billboard last year,external. ""I want to affect change and I want to impact the communities that I grew up in, and the ones like it."" Paying his own tribute, hip hop mogul Diddy said Nipsey ""represents change, he represents evolution, he represents everything our culture needs to embrace"". Allow Twitter content?

"London Liverpool Street was among the stations to make their toilets free to use from Monday Ever been caught short at a station scrambling for coins to pay for the toilet? Now passengers at the UK's busiest railway stations will be able to spend a penny for free - after Network Rail scrapped charges. On Monday, London Liverpool Street, London King's Cross and Edinburgh Waverley became the last of its 20 stations to make their toilets free. Previously, some charged up to 50p per person. Network Rail said it wanted to put ""passengers first"" and help make their journeys ""a bit more hassle-free"". In 2017it was revealedthat the public sector body had made Â£41m in 10 years from toilet charges. The latest figuresshow Network Rail-run stations across the UK made Â£3.1m from toilet charges in 2017-18. Where have all the public toilets gone? Paralympian wins train toilet payout Independent watchdog Transport Focus said toilets were a ""priority for improvement"" at stations according to its research. It said scrapping charges was ""a welcome step for passengers"". Ben Macfarlane says making station toilets free will help reduce the stress of travelling Ben Macfarlane, 39, was diagnosed with Crohn's disease - a chronic condition which causes inflammation in parts of the digestive system disease - 20 years ago. His condition means he often needs to use the toilet at short notice and he said charges at stations had caused him a lot of stress in the past. ""I used to panic when at the station and always have to check and make sure I had enough money and even the correct change,"" he said. ""There have been times in the past when I have had to ask for change, and when you're desperate to go the last thing you need is to be stopping to ask someone for change to use the toilet. ""As I look fit and well, people question you when you say you need to use the toilet but don't have the change,"" he added. He said scrapping charges would mean he could go to the toilet without being asked any questions, which he said could cause ""added embarrassment"". Other stations run by Network Rail - including Birmingham New Street, Manchester Piccadilly and Glasgow Central - have already scrapped toilet charges. Smaller stations managed by local train operating companies may still charge for the use of facilities. Network Rail said the move was one of a number of measures to help passengers. Other improvements being made at stations include the introduction of water fountains, better and more seating, and reducing clutter on concourses.

"This video can not be played Liz talks about the moment her son was permanently excluded from school A mother has called for more help for parents of children removed from schools, saying she was left ""bewildered"" when her son was excluded. Liz's son was out of school for six months and later diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). The most recent figures for 2016-17 show a 51% rise in pupils permanently excluded from schools in Wales. A teacher's leader said numbers were low and decisions were taken seriously. Liz, who lives in Bridgend county, said problems began when her son started secondary school at a time when his father had moved out of the area and his grandfather had died. Liz picks up the story. ""When he started secondary school he wasn't settling, he found it overwhelming I think. Then he had his appendix out, he was quite poorly and when he went back, he'd fallen so far behind, that's when his behaviour really deteriorated. Reality Check: Why are 1,000 children being expelled? What is it like to be excluded from school? ""It started off fairly small things - disturbing the class, making funny noises. Then it got to the point he was getting up in class, wandering around, distracting the other children which then went on to leaving the classroom, running around the school, no respect for the teachers. ""For him, he saw school as a big game. I was constantly angry with him, getting calls at work to collect him from school - it was on a daily basis. I just wanted him to stop, I put punishments in place and tried grounding him, but it was a constant battle. It was horrific. ""The school weren't helpful in any way. The exclusion started, maybe one day or two days a week. ""In between he was playing truant. When he was there he was causing absolute chaos. I believed he needed counselling - that never happened, they [the school] said they tried it with a teacher. ""The first day of his second year, he went to school. I had a call to say he'd really gone on a 'jolly', teachers were looking for him and he was going to be permanently excluded. I was so upset. He came in the house and went upstairs. His head was bowed and he said: ""Mum, I don't understand why I do the things I do,"". And I cuddled him. There was nothing else to do but hold him. ""A social worker got involved and managed to help get him into another school [10 miles away]. That school really tried with him - it was hands on from the minute he got there and that was the first time then words about his diagnosis [ADHD] were used. But he couldn't cope with mainstream school - me and the head of year made the decision to remove him because it was hurting him. He'd made so many improvements but it was hurting him. ""He was feeling low. I remember him saying ""what's going to happen to me mum?"" It broke my heart and I said: ""You're going to be fine."" ""He did worry. This wasn't a child who didn't want to do anything with school. ""He's now at a different school - for children like him, children with other conditions and disabilities."" From an initial two hours a day he is now back at school full time. ""From that day to this, what a change in the boy - the school are marvellous with him. He still has his off days but he's come on so much."" Far fewer pupils are permanently excluded than in the middle of the 2000s.Guidance was issued by the Welsh Government in 2012,external, setting out how exclusions should be used and to do so permanently should be only a ""final step"" in the disciplinary process. But both the numbers - and rate - of permanent school exclusions have jumped in the last year. Some pupils - like Liz's son - are excluded for persistent behaviour issues. But violence or supplying drugs are two reasons why a pupil might be permanently excluded for a first or one-off offence. Dr April May Kitchener runs Siarad Da, which works with some children who have been excluded and their families. She said that there are big differences in the way schools approach exclusions, with some offering more pastoral support than others. ""We are seeing children with challenging behaviour because of learning difficulties experiencing greater levels of exclusion but we are also seeing lower levels of tolerance for these children as well particularly in a school which is pushing very hard to show how well it's doing academically,"" she said. Tim Pratt, director of the Association of School and College Leaders Cymru, said: ""The rate of exclusions has increased at a time of intense funding pressure on schools in Wales. ""This makes it more difficult to provide the early intervention which prevents behavioural issues from escalating to the point of exclusion, and this is therefore likely to result in an increase in the number of exclusions."" Knife crime: Are school exclusions to blame? Mental health issues blamed for exclusion rise Why has Scotland's exclusion rate dropped? He added: ""Even so, the rate of exclusions, and particularly permanent exclusions, remains low, reflecting the fact that these decisions are taken extremely seriously and only after a great deal of thought and consideration."" Mr Pratt said it was sometimes necessary to permanently exclude in the best interests of other pupils, while excluded pupils could also benefit from a fresh start elsewhere. Liz said looking back, the experience was ""bewildering"" and ""a hard two years"" for her son. ""There was no help in place - he was off school for six months and I still had to work, a lot of times that boy was on his own, he was down, he was very unhappy. She said she ""doesn't understand the logic behind it - your child is really naughty we're going to move him on, it'll be someone else's problem. How does that ever help the child?"" A Bridgend council spokesman said supporting the best possible outcomes for children was a priority. ""A clear and agreed process is followed when permanent exclusions are issued by schools,"" he said. ""They are always a last resort, and exclusions had steadily decreased in recent years."" Are school exclusions causing knife crime? Does school exclusion cause knife crime? Mental health blamed for exclusion rise Schools admit informally excluding pupils School exclusions 'fuelling gang violence' Reality Check: Why are 1,000 children being expelled?

"Terry Maher spent more than 12 hours protesting on the roof A Brexit supporter has admitted staging a protest which disrupted services out of St Pancras on the day the UK was due to leave the EU. Terry Maher, from Camden, north London, caused eight Eurostar services to be cancelled during a 12 hour stand-off with police that began on Friday night. Westminster Magistrates' Court heard the 44-year-old told police he was angry with politicians over Brexit. He was remanded in custody after he admitted causing a public nuisance. The court was told Maher climbed on to a roof soon after 19:00 GMT claiming to be armed with a Stanley knife and was not brought down until the following morning. A National Rail statement described the building that he scaled as a railway viaduct that crosses the high-speed lines just outside St Pancras. As well as halting Eurostar services, Southeastern Trains was forced to cancel 16 services and part-cancel 44 others. A further 28 services were also delayed. Up to 8,000 people were estimated to have been affected by Maher's actions Prosecutor Robert Simpson said Maher's actions caused delays for between 7,000 and 8,000 people. ""There was a total of 1,757 minutes of lost time as a result of it and the estimation is that there will be in excess of Â£40,000 in delay fines,"" he said. The court heard that following his arrest, Maher had told police he ""disliked politicians"" because they were messing up Brexit. Brexit: What happens next? How could Brexit be delayed? MPs reject May's EU withdrawal agreement He also made ""various other comments about illegal immigrants in the country"" and complained about foreign aid money being spent in India, Mr Simpson said. District Judge Richard Blake said the protest was ""very serious indeed"" and had ""cost many thousands of pounds"". ""I should think untold members of the public had their weekends spoiled,"" he said. Maher is next due to appear at Blackfriars Crown Court on 29 April in relation to a second charge under the Malicious Damage Act.

"Kanye West has spent the last year making headlines for everything except his music. But fans of the artist have been treated to something special each Sunday over the past few months. Tune into Kim Kardashian's Instagram Stories and there you'll find Kanye and a choir belting out renditions of some of his most famous songs - as well as bits of music that seem to be brand new. Known as Kanye West's Sunday Service, it's been announced the act is heading to Coachella Festival in California to perform on Easter Sunday. Allow Twitter content?

Religion has always been important to Kanye West's music. And he's got a famously big ego. So when he debuted Sunday Service at the beginning of 2019, and it looked like he was starting his own church, people weren't that surprised. A lot of what goes on at Sunday Service remains pretty secretive - people are even reportedly made to signnon-disclosure agreements. But from the snapshots we're shown it all seems to centre around the choir/live orchestra. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Unsurprisingly, with Kanye and the Kardashians involved, Sunday Service has become a bit of a celeb hot spot. A Sunday Service invitation is the ""most prestigious, highly-coveted"" invitation possible for musicians in LA, according to Variety - which describes it as ""where spirituality and exclusivity meet"". Katy Perry and Orlando Bloom are among the A-listers who've been spotted there. But Sunday Service has also led to a whole host of new fans for five year old North West - Kim and Kanye's oldest child - because of videos like this. Allow Twitter content?

"Jon Snow is the longest-running presenter of Channel 4 News More than 2,000 people have complained after Channel 4 presenter Jon Snow said of a pro-Brexit rally that he had ""never seen so many white people"". Media watchdog Ofcom said it had received 2,025 complaints and was deciding whether to investigate. The Channel 4 News anchor made the comment when he was signing off from Friday evening's live bulletin. A spokeswoman said it was ""an unscripted observation"", and said Channel 4 News regretted any offence. Snow was speaking as pictures showed protesters in Westminster afterMPs had rejected Prime Minister Theresa May's EU withdrawal agreementon the day the UK was due to leave the EU. Snow told viewers: ""It's been the most extraordinary day. A day which has seen... I have never seen so many white people in one place, it's an extraordinary story. This video can not be played Leave supporters have gathered outside Parliament ""There are people everywhere, there are crowds everywhere.""

"Tens of thousands of workers in the hospitality sector are set to receive a pay rise Two million UK workers on minimum wages are now receiving a pay rise - but a string of household bills have also increased. Workers aged 25 and over on the National Living Wage will receive Â£8.21 an hour from Monday, up from Â£7.83 - a 4.9% rise. Pay rises also take effect for younger workers on minimum wages. However, the pay rise comes as bills ranging from council tax to the TV licence fee become more expensive. Women represent an estimated 60% of those who are benefitting from the rise in minimum wage rates. Workers in the hospitality and retail sectors are the most likely to be on the lowest pay, and nearly 200,000 of them will receive the pay rise. The charity the Living Wage Foundation says the wage level needed to ""meet the costs of living"" isÂ£9 an hour across the UK and Â£10.55 an hour in London,external ""We are pleased that million of workers across the country will see an above-inflation pay rise,"" said Bryan Sanderson, who chairs the Low Pay Commission, which recommends the appropriate level of pay. He pointed out that 20 years since the introduction of the minimum wage, there had been no significant effect on jobs, despite the extra cost to businesses. How high can the minimum wage go? In that time, the minimum wage has risen much faster than average pay. Workers in general have seen wage growth beat inflation in recent months, after a period when price rises were greater than pay rises. However, all households are seeing increases in a variety of regular bills. They include: Council tax or its equivalent, set by local authorities, which isgoing up by more than inflationfor millions of people Gas or electricity prices for more than half of British households who are on variable or default tariffs, typically going up by Â£117 a year, now thecap on the cost has been raised TheTV licence fee, which has gone up from Â£150.50 to Â£154.50 a year The standard NHS prescription charge in England, which has risen from Â£8.90 to Â£9, although Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland have abolished these fees. Other changes include a small rise inwater bills,external, various increases onvehicle tax rates,external, and a rise in some companies' phone and broadband prices. However, price caps are now in effect forhousehold rent-to-own items, limiting the interest that customers pay to no more than the product's cost, andphone calls to directory enquiries. Minimum wages in the UK are among the highest compared to typical pay in advanced economies of the world. The government said that it was ""determined"" for low pay to end. However, the TUC has argued that minimum wage levels remain too low. It wants all workers aged between 21 and 24 to receive the same as those aged 25 and over, and for them all to receive Â£10 a hour. ""Young workers are still getting a raw deal on pay. Their bills are not any cheaper, but they have to make ends meet with less. That is just not fair,"" said TUC general secretary Frances O'Grady. How long would it take you to earn a star player's salary? Automation could replace 1.5 million jobs, says ONS Firms drag their feet on gender pay gap reporting There has been a long-running campaign encouraging businesses to pay their workers a higher amount. Katherine Chapman, director of the Living Wage Foundation, said: ""Over 5,000 responsible employers have gone beyond the government minimum and committed to pay a real living wage. We now need to see more businesses step up and provide a wage that truly covers the cost of living."" The National Living Wage is the legally binding hourly rate for workers aged 25 and over The real living wage was devised by charity the Living Wage Foundation. It argues the government's National Living Wage is not high enough to meet workers' needs and encourages employers to adopt its more generous, independently-calculated rate You v Neymar: How do your salaries compare?

"This video can not be played Liz talks about the moment her son was permanently excluded from school A mother has called for more help for parents of children removed from schools, saying she was left ""bewildered"" when her son was excluded. Liz's son was out of school for six months and later diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). The most recent figures for 2016-17 show a 51% rise in pupils permanently excluded from schools in Wales. A teacher's leader said numbers were low and decisions were taken seriously. Liz, who lives in Bridgend county, said problems began when her son started secondary school at a time when his father had moved out of the area and his grandfather had died. Liz picks up the story. ""When he started secondary school he wasn't settling, he found it overwhelming I think. Then he had his appendix out, he was quite poorly and when he went back, he'd fallen so far behind, that's when his behaviour really deteriorated. Reality Check: Why are 1,000 children being expelled? What is it like to be excluded from school? ""It started off fairly small things - disturbing the class, making funny noises. Then it got to the point he was getting up in class, wandering around, distracting the other children which then went on to leaving the classroom, running around the school, no respect for the teachers. ""For him, he saw school as a big game. I was constantly angry with him, getting calls at work to collect him from school - it was on a daily basis. I just wanted him to stop, I put punishments in place and tried grounding him, but it was a constant battle. It was horrific. ""The school weren't helpful in any way. The exclusion started, maybe one day or two days a week. ""In between he was playing truant. When he was there he was causing absolute chaos. I believed he needed counselling - that never happened, they [the school] said they tried it with a teacher. ""The first day of his second year, he went to school. I had a call to say he'd really gone on a 'jolly', teachers were looking for him and he was going to be permanently excluded. I was so upset. He came in the house and went upstairs. His head was bowed and he said: ""Mum, I don't understand why I do the things I do,"". And I cuddled him. There was nothing else to do but hold him. ""A social worker got involved and managed to help get him into another school [10 miles away]. That school really tried with him - it was hands on from the minute he got there and that was the first time then words about his diagnosis [ADHD] were used. But he couldn't cope with mainstream school - me and the head of year made the decision to remove him because it was hurting him. He'd made so many improvements but it was hurting him. ""He was feeling low. I remember him saying ""what's going to happen to me mum?"" It broke my heart and I said: ""You're going to be fine."" ""He did worry. This wasn't a child who didn't want to do anything with school. ""He's now at a different school - for children like him, children with other conditions and disabilities."" From an initial two hours a day he is now back at school full time. ""From that day to this, what a change in the boy - the school are marvellous with him. He still has his off days but he's come on so much."" Far fewer pupils are permanently excluded than in the middle of the 2000s.Guidance was issued by the Welsh Government in 2012,external, setting out how exclusions should be used and to do so permanently should be only a ""final step"" in the disciplinary process. But both the numbers - and rate - of permanent school exclusions have jumped in the last year. Some pupils - like Liz's son - are excluded for persistent behaviour issues. But violence or supplying drugs are two reasons why a pupil might be permanently excluded for a first or one-off offence. Dr April May Kitchener runs Siarad Da, which works with some children who have been excluded and their families. She said that there are big differences in the way schools approach exclusions, with some offering more pastoral support than others. ""We are seeing children with challenging behaviour because of learning difficulties experiencing greater levels of exclusion but we are also seeing lower levels of tolerance for these children as well particularly in a school which is pushing very hard to show how well it's doing academically,"" she said. Tim Pratt, director of the Association of School and College Leaders Cymru, said: ""The rate of exclusions has increased at a time of intense funding pressure on schools in Wales. ""This makes it more difficult to provide the early intervention which prevents behavioural issues from escalating to the point of exclusion, and this is therefore likely to result in an increase in the number of exclusions."" Knife crime: Are school exclusions to blame? Mental health issues blamed for exclusion rise Why has Scotland's exclusion rate dropped? He added: ""Even so, the rate of exclusions, and particularly permanent exclusions, remains low, reflecting the fact that these decisions are taken extremely seriously and only after a great deal of thought and consideration."" Mr Pratt said it was sometimes necessary to permanently exclude in the best interests of other pupils, while excluded pupils could also benefit from a fresh start elsewhere. Liz said looking back, the experience was ""bewildering"" and ""a hard two years"" for her son. ""There was no help in place - he was off school for six months and I still had to work, a lot of times that boy was on his own, he was down, he was very unhappy. She said she ""doesn't understand the logic behind it - your child is really naughty we're going to move him on, it'll be someone else's problem. How does that ever help the child?"" A Bridgend council spokesman said supporting the best possible outcomes for children was a priority. ""A clear and agreed process is followed when permanent exclusions are issued by schools,"" he said. ""They are always a last resort, and exclusions had steadily decreased in recent years."" Are school exclusions causing knife crime? Does school exclusion cause knife crime?

"Opposition CHP supporters celebrated in Istanbul The party of Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has lost control of the capital, Ankara, in local elections, in a blow to his 16-year rule. The main opposition is also slightly ahead in the contest for mayor of Istanbul, figures published by the state-run Anadolu news agency suggest. But the president's AKP party is challenging the result in both cities. Municipal elections were held across the nation on Sunday and an AKP-led alliance won more than 51% of the vote. The elections, considered a verdict on Mr Erdogan's rule, have been taking place during an economic downturn. The currency, the lira, has been losing value recently and the economy went into recession in the last three months of 2018. Erdogan shows NZ attack video at rallies Why is Turkey fighting the markets? Erdogan: Turkey's pugnacious president The AKP - or Justice and Development Party - alleges ""invalid votes and irregularities in most of the 12,158 polling stations in Ankara"". Its general secretary, Fatih Sahin, said on Twitter: ""We will use our legal rights to the fullest, and we will not allow the will of our citizens to be altered in Ankara."" This video can not be played Erdogan: ""We will appeal wherever needed"" The AKP says it will also challenge the result in Istanbul - the largest city - and the eastern province of Igdir. Commenting on the results in a speech on Sunday, Mr Erdogan looked ahead to national elections in 2023: ""We have a long period ahead where we will carry out economic reforms without compromising on the rules of the free-market economy. ""If there are any shortcomings, it is our duty to correct them,"" he said. More than 57 million people in the country were registered to vote for mayors and councillors. Turnout was high at just under 85%. The opposition Republican People's Party (CHP) candidate Mansur Yavas won in Ankara, officials said. With almost all votes counted, he was on nearly 51% and the AKP's Mehmet Ozhaseki had won the support of just over 47%. Both CHP and the AKP claim victory in Istanbul, which has been in the hands of parties linked to Mr Erdogan since 1994, when he was elected the city's mayor. The election commission said the CHP's Ekrem Imamoglu was leading there by less than 0.5%, but that the results of more than 80 ballot boxes were being challenged. Results carried by Anadolu put the margin even narrower, at less than 0.25%. The CHP's mayoral candidate for Istanbul Ekrem Imamoglu has claimed victory by 28,000 votes The AKP had been saying its candidate, former Prime Minister Binali Yildirim, was ahead by 4,000 votes. He later conceded his opponent had a narrow lead, only for the AKP to again claim victory. The third largest city, Izmir, went to the CHP. ""The people have voted in favour of democracy. They have chosen democracy,"" CHP leader Kemal Kilicdaroglu said. Analysis by Mark Lowen, BBC Turkey correspondent Electoral figures show Istanbul falling to the opposition by a whisker, although the ruling party has challenged the result and refused to concede. Ekrem Imamoglu, who's already changed his Twitter profile to ""mayor of Istanbul"", has vowed to serve all sides - those who voted for and against him - without discrimination. President Erdogan's setbacks deepened elsewhere, losing the capital, Ankara, and several other cities as his conservative voters punished him for an economic crisis. Local elections are important here. Parties build their base at grassroots level; Mr Erdogan himself gained power after being mayor of Istanbul. He turned this poll into, in effect, a referendum on himself. Now his image of invincibility has been broken and an opposition long seen as hopelessly divided has got a new lease of life. Swathes of Turkey still adore Mr Erdogan, but the half of the country that detests its polarising president are starting to believe he's beatable. This was the first municipal vote since Mr Erdogan assumed sweeping executive powers through last year's presidential election. The AKP, with its roots in political Islam, has won every election since coming to power in 2002. Mr Erdogan, whose two-month campaign included 100 rallies, said the poll was about the ""survival"" of the country and his party. AKP supporters also celebrated in Istanbul - but Mr Erdogan later hinted that the party may have lost control there With most media either pro-government or controlled by Mr Erdogan's supporters, critics believe opposition parties campaigned at a disadvantage. Mr Erdogan's rallies dominated TV coverage. The opposition pro-Kurdish Peoples' Democratic Party (HDP) said the elections were unfair and refused to put forward candidates in several cities. Some of its leaders have been jailed on terrorism charges, accusations they reject. Why is Turkey fighting the markets?

"The new law will criminalise psychological abuse A new law has come into force that makes psychological domestic abuse and controlling behaviour a crime. It will be supported by a Scottish government awareness campaign aimed at improving public understanding of the wide-ranging nature of the problem. The Scottish Parliamentpassed the Domestic Abuse Actin February last year. Police Scotland said officers have been given extra training in preparation for the change in law. The legislation covers not just physical abuse, but psychological and emotional treatment and coercive and controlling behaviour, where abusers isolate their victim from their friends and relatives or control their finances. It takes account of the full breadth of violent, threatening, intimidating and other controlling behaviour which can destroy a victim's autonomy and further recognises the adverse impact domestic abuse can have on children. The new legislation says abusive behaviour is: Behaviour that is violent, threatening or intimidating Behaviour whose purpose is one of the following: making a partner dependent or subordinate isolating a partner from friends, relatives or other sources of support controlling, regulating or monitoring a partner's day-to-day activities depriving a partner of, or restricting, freedom of action frightening, humiliating, degrading or punishing a partner. The offence is aggravated if any of the behaviour is directed at a child or witnessed by them. The Act also requires courts to consider imposing a non-harassment order on an offender convicted of a domestic abuse offence to protect their victim from further abuse. For police it means they can now include evidence of coercive and controlling behaviour where it forms a pattern alongside physical and sexual abuse. Justice Secretary Humza Yousaf said: ""The Domestic Abuse Act makes absolutely clear that coercive and controlling behaviour is domestic abuse and a crime. ""I am proud Scotland is leading the way with this groundbreaking legislation, which uniquely recognises the effect of domestic abuse on child victims as well as adults."" MSPs applauded domestic abuse survivors in the public gallery after the legislation was passed One survivor has urged anyone living with domestic abuse to seek help. Roshni, 29, left an abusive marriage with support from Hemat Gryffe Women's Aid in Glasgow. She said: ""At first the marriage was so good, but after a few months I realised there was something wrong. He didn't give me any money, so I always had to stay at home, I felt so isolated. ""He was always pushing me and abusing me in front of my family and friends. ""This was a really bad situation for me, I wanted to live with respect as a person. ""If you feel like you are in my situation being controlled or abused by your partner, seek help, it's your life."" Assistant Chief Constable Gillian MacDonald, crime and protection lead for Police Scotland, said: ""This new offence is groundbreaking. For the first time, it will allow us to investigate and report the full circumstances of an abusive relationship. ""In preparation for the change in law our officers and staff have received further training on the dynamics of power and control in abusive relationships to help recognise the signs, identify investigative opportunities and to tackle the myths and misconceptions of abuse that still exist. ""This new offence is a clear warning to abusers that all forms of domestic abuse are criminal and that perpetrators should expect to face the full consequences of their abusive behaviour.""

"UK factories stockpiled goods for Brexit at an unexpectedly high rate last month, boosting manufacturing growth to a 13-month high, according to a closely watched survey. The research, by IHS Markit/CIPS,,externalfound that the rate of increase in stocks hit a survey record high for the third month in a row. The Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) for the manufacturing sector rose to 55.1 in March, from 52.1 in February. A figure above 50 indicates expansion. The PMI has remained above that benchmark for 32 months in a row. However, Rob Dobson, director at IHS Markit, warned that the boost to the UK economy could prove short-lived. Business 'devastated' by Brexit vote Brexit: Stop chasing rainbows, say firms UK rates on hold amid Brexit impasse He said: ""Manufacturers are already reporting concerns that future trends could be constrained as inventory positions across the economy are unwound. ""The survey is also picking up signs that EU companies are switching away from sourcing inputs from UK firms as Brexit approaches. ""It looks as if the impact of Brexit preparations, and any missed opportunities and investments during this sustained period of uncertainty, will reverberate through the manufacturing sector for some time to come."" Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said the rise in the manufacturing PMI in March largely reflected producers rushing to complete work before the Brexit deadline, rather than a strengthening of underlying demand. He added: ""We continue to doubt that precautionary stockpiling for a no-deal Brexit will boost GDP, because manufacturers primarily are buying imports and are tying up cash that otherwise might have been used for investment. ""All told, then, the PMI should not instil any confidence about the near-term outlook for the manufacturing sector."" A comparable PMI survey for the eurozone,externalsuggested that operating conditions for manufacturers in the 19-nation bloc deteriorated in March at the fastest pace for nearly six years. The IHS Markit eurozone manufacturing PMI fell to 47.5 last month, down from 49.3 in February and the lowest reading since April 2013. It was also the second month in a row that the figure has been below 50, indicating contraction. Eurozone manufacturers are becoming more risk averse, the survey suggested The downturn has hit the eurozone's three biggest economies. Germany - the bloc's largest economy - had a PMI reading of 44.1, the lowest for more than six-and-a-half years. Italy's PMI of 47.4 was a near six-year low, while France's manufacturing sector also contracted, having seen some growth the month before. ""The March PMI data indicate that the eurozone's manufacturing sector is in its steepest downturn since the height of the region's debt crisis in 2012,"" said Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit. ""Concerns over trade wars, tariffs, rising political uncertainty, Brexit and - perhaps most importantly - deteriorating forecasts for the economic environment both at home and in export markets, were widely reported to have dampened business activity and confidence. ""Cost cutting has become more evident as firms grow more risk averse, notably with respect to hiring. Job losses were reported in both Germany and Italy, where the downturn in demand is doing the most damage.""

"Tens of thousands of workers in the hospitality sector are set to receive a pay rise Two million UK workers on minimum wages are now receiving a pay rise - but a string of household bills have also increased. Workers aged 25 and over on the National Living Wage will receive Â£8.21 an hour from Monday, up from Â£7.83 - a 4.9% rise. Pay rises also take effect for younger workers on minimum wages. However, the pay rise comes as bills ranging from council tax to the TV licence fee become more expensive. Women represent an estimated 60% of those who are benefitting from the rise in minimum wage rates. Workers in the hospitality and retail sectors are the most likely to be on the lowest pay, and nearly 200,000 of them will receive the pay rise. The charity the Living Wage Foundation says the wage level needed to ""meet the costs of living"" isÂ£9 an hour across the UK and Â£10.55 an hour in London,external ""We are pleased that million of workers across the country will see an above-inflation pay rise,"" said Bryan Sanderson, who chairs the Low Pay Commission, which recommends the appropriate level of pay. He pointed out that 20 years since the introduction of the minimum wage, there had been no significant effect on jobs, despite the extra cost to businesses. How high can the minimum wage go? In that time, the minimum wage has risen much faster than average pay. Workers in general have seen wage growth beat inflation in recent months, after a period when price rises were greater than pay rises. However, all households are seeing increases in a variety of regular bills. They include: Council tax or its equivalent, set by local authorities, which isgoing up by more than inflationfor millions of people Gas or electricity prices for more than half of British households who are on variable or default tariffs, typically going up by Â£117 a year, now thecap on the cost has been raised TheTV licence fee, which has gone up from Â£150.50 to Â£154.50 a year The standard NHS prescription charge in England, which has risen from Â£8.90 to Â£9, although Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland have abolished these fees. Other changes include a small rise inwater bills,external, various increases onvehicle tax rates,external, and a rise in some companies' phone and broadband prices. However, price caps are now in effect forhousehold rent-to-own items, limiting the interest that customers pay to no more than the product's cost, andphone calls to directory enquiries. Minimum wages in the UK are among the highest compared to typical pay in advanced economies of the world. The government said that it was ""determined"" for low pay to end. However, the TUC has argued that minimum wage levels remain too low. It wants all workers aged between 21 and 24 to receive the same as those aged 25 and over, and for them all to receive Â£10 a hour. ""Young workers are still getting a raw deal on pay. Their bills are not any cheaper, but they have to make ends meet with less. That is just not fair,"" said TUC general secretary Frances O'Grady. How long would it take you to earn a star player's salary? Automation could replace 1.5 million jobs, says ONS Firms drag their feet on gender pay gap reporting There has been a long-running campaign encouraging businesses to pay their workers a higher amount. Katherine Chapman, director of the Living Wage Foundation, said: ""Over 5,000 responsible employers have gone beyond the government minimum and committed to pay a real living wage. We now need to see more businesses step up and provide a wage that truly covers the cost of living."" The National Living Wage is the legally binding hourly rate for workers aged 25 and over The real living wage was devised by charity the Living Wage Foundation.

"Home Secretary Sajid Javid wants to make it a legal duty to report concerns over at-risk young people Teachers, NHS workers and police officers in England and Wales could be held accountable for failing to spot violent crime among young people under government plans announced on Monday. Home Secretary Sajid Javid has launched a consultation to assess whether there is a ""public health duty"" to report concerns over children at risk. He said he will use ""all the tools"" at his disposal to end violent crime. But unions for teachers and NHS staff have raised concerns about the plans. A summit on serious youth violence is being held at Downing Street this week. Dr Mary Bousted, joint general secretary of the National Education Union, said: ""Neither the blame for, or the solution to, violent crime can be laid at the door of schools or front-line hospital staff."" She said schools already had ""strong safeguarding practices in place"" and added: ""The problem is what happens after issues of concern have been identified."" The Royal College of Nursing, meanwhile, expressed concerns that obligations to report people involved in violent crime could deter people ""from seeking help for fear of being reported"". Knife crime: More stop and search powers for police Surgeons who want you to touch knife crime The teenagers living in fear of knives The government says its plan is intended to ""help spot the warning signs that a young person could be in danger, such as presenting in A&E with suspicious injury, to worrying behaviour at school or issues at home"". Mr Javid called violent crime ""a disease rotting our society"" and said he was ""committed to ending this scourge"". ""The public health, multi-agency approach has a proven track record and I'm confident that making it a legal duty will help stop this senseless violence and create long-term change,"" he added. Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Children's Commissioner for England Anne Longfield said agencies such as schools ""don't often feel that they've got the tools or the systems"" to know what to do with children who might be involved in, or at risk of, violent crime. She added: ""We've got to think of more creative and effective ways to help these children."" Teachers' leaders are highly sceptical about these knife crime proposals - suggesting it's a way of avoiding thornier questions such as the number of police on the streets. Heads and teachers say they don't understand how in practice schools would be held ""accountable"" for reporting those at risk of knife crime. ""It is hard to see how it would be either workable or reasonable to make teachers accountable,"" says Geoff Barton, leader of the ASCL head teachers' union. ""What sort of behaviour would they be expected to report and who would they report to?"" he says. Schools are at risk of getting caught in a blame-game over knife crime, says Chris Keates, leader of the NASUWT teachers' union, who warns of teachers being ""scapegoated"". If teachers were to face sanctions over spotting those at risk, she says it would create a ""culture of defensive reporting"", in which the police and social services would be swamped by referrals. Majella Fergus, 53, a biology teacher at a secondary school in Cumbria, told the BBC that in recent years both the government and parents had tried to transfer their responsibilities ""onto the shoulders of teachers"". ""Adding yet another non-teaching responsibility to the shoulders of strained teachers and squashed teaching time grinds us down further,"" she said. ""Knife crime is a much wider societal issue and it isn't just simply going to be fought by teachers."" Majella Fergus told the BBC she felt the government was trying to shirk its responsibilities The Home Office announcement comes a day after Mr Javidhanded the police greater stop and search powersto tackle rising knife crime in England. With 285 deaths from stabbings in 2017-18, the most ever recorded in the UK,ministers have come under increasing pressure to tackle knife crime. As well as hosting the summit on youth violence in England and Wales, which starts on Monday, Prime Minister Theresa May will meet privately with families affected by knife crime. Mrs May said that while strong law enforcement ""plays an important role"", she added that communities need to look at what they can do to safeguard young people. ""That is why our plans to introduce a whole community - or 'public health' - approach are designed to identify more young people at risk,"" she said. More than 100 experts will meet at Downing Street during the week to discuss the issue. The consultation, which is open to the public and professionals across the UK, will run until May 28.

"Kanye West has spent the last year making headlines for everything except his music. But fans of the artist have been treated to something special each Sunday over the past few months. Tune into Kim Kardashian's Instagram Stories and there you'll find Kanye and a choir belting out renditions of some of his most famous songs - as well as bits of music that seem to be brand new. Known as Kanye West's Sunday Service, it's been announced the act is heading to Coachella Festival in California to perform on Easter Sunday. Allow Twitter content?

Religion has always been important to Kanye West's music. And he's got a famously big ego. So when he debuted Sunday Service at the beginning of 2019, and it looked like he was starting his own church, people weren't that surprised. A lot of what goes on at Sunday Service remains pretty secretive - people are even reportedly made to signnon-disclosure agreements. But from the snapshots we're shown it all seems to centre around the choir/live orchestra. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Whether it's Jesus Walks, Father Stretch My Hands Pt.1 or Lift Off, Sunday Service often seems to showcase a reinterpretation of Kanye's tracks.

Unsurprisingly, with Kanye and the Kardashians involved, Sunday Service has become a bit of a celeb hot spot. A Sunday Service invitation is the ""most prestigious, highly-coveted"" invitation possible for musicians in LA, according to Variety - which describes it as ""where spirituality and exclusivity meet"". Katy Perry and Orlando Bloom are among the A-listers who've been spotted there. But Sunday Service has also led to a whole host of new fans for five year old North West - Kim and Kanye's oldest child - because of videos like this. Allow Twitter content?

There's speculation that Kanye West's Sunday Service could be leading up to another gospel album from the rapper - a few years after the gospel-influenced The Life of Pablo came out. Kanye had promised an album at the end of last year - called Yandhi - which was delayed.

"Dame Helen Mirren has described Mallet as ""loyal and generous"" Actress Tania Mallet, who played Bond girl Tilly Masterson in Goldfinger, has died aged 77. Mallet, a cousin of Dame Helen Mirren, starred alongside Sean Connery in the 1964 spy film. The Blackpool-born actress had been working as a model when she was cast by producer Albert ""Cubby"" Broccoli - a world she ultimately returned to and prioritised over film. Her death was announced via the official 007 Twitter account. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Speaking toJames Bond fan site MI6,externalin 2003, Mallet said that although filming had been an ""interesting"" experience, she had always been ""more comfortable"" in a small studio with ""just a photographer and his assistant"". Mallet first rose to prominence as a model ""The restrictions placed on me for the duration of the filming grated, were dreadful and I could not anticipate living my life like that,"" she added. The ""dreadful"" pay also discouraged her. ""Originally, I was offered Â£50 per week, which I managed to push up to Â£150, but even so I earned more than that in a day modelling. ""So the six months I worked (or was retained to work) on Goldfinger were real sacrifice."" Mallet was related to Dame Helen through her mother, whose younger brother was Dame Helen's father.

"Opposition CHP supporters celebrated in Istanbul The party of Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has lost control of the capital, Ankara, in local elections, in a blow to his 16-year rule. The main opposition is also slightly ahead in the contest for mayor of Istanbul, figures published by the state-run Anadolu news agency suggest. But the president's AKP party is challenging the result in both cities. Municipal elections were held across the nation on Sunday and an AKP-led alliance won more than 51% of the vote. The elections, considered a verdict on Mr Erdogan's rule, have been taking place during an economic downturn. The currency, the lira, has been losing value recently and the economy went into recession in the last three months of 2018. Erdogan shows NZ attack video at rallies Why is Turkey fighting the markets? Erdogan: Turkey's pugnacious president The AKP - or Justice and Development Party - alleges ""invalid votes and irregularities in most of the 12,158 polling stations in Ankara"". Its general secretary, Fatih Sahin, said on Twitter: ""We will use our legal rights to the fullest, and we will not allow the will of our citizens to be altered in Ankara."" This video can not be played Erdogan: ""We will appeal wherever needed"" The AKP says it will also challenge the result in Istanbul - the largest city - and the eastern province of Igdir. Commenting on the results in a speech on Sunday, Mr Erdogan looked ahead to national elections in 2023: ""We have a long period ahead where we will carry out economic reforms without compromising on the rules of the free-market economy. ""If there are any shortcomings, it is our duty to correct them,"" he said. More than 57 million people in the country were registered to vote for mayors and councillors. Turnout was high at just under 85%. The opposition Republican People's Party (CHP) candidate Mansur Yavas won in Ankara, officials said. With almost all votes counted, he was on nearly 51% and the AKP's Mehmet Ozhaseki had won the support of just over 47%. Both CHP and the AKP claim victory in Istanbul, which has been in the hands of parties linked to Mr Erdogan since 1994, when he was elected the city's mayor. The election commission said the CHP's Ekrem Imamoglu was leading there by less than 0.5%, but that the results of more than 80 ballot boxes were being challenged. Results carried by Anadolu put the margin even narrower, at less than 0.25%. The CHP's mayoral candidate for Istanbul Ekrem Imamoglu has claimed victory by 28,000 votes The AKP had been saying its candidate, former Prime Minister Binali Yildirim, was ahead by 4,000 votes. He later conceded his opponent had a narrow lead, only for the AKP to again claim victory. The third largest city, Izmir, went to the CHP. ""The people have voted in favour of democracy. They have chosen democracy,"" CHP leader Kemal Kilicdaroglu said. Analysis by Mark Lowen, BBC Turkey correspondent Electoral figures show Istanbul falling to the opposition by a whisker, although the ruling party has challenged the result and refused to concede. Ekrem Imamoglu, who's already changed his Twitter profile to ""mayor of Istanbul"", has vowed to serve all sides - those who voted for and against him - without discrimination. President Erdogan's setbacks deepened elsewhere, losing the capital, Ankara, and several other cities as his conservative voters punished him for an economic crisis. Local elections are important here. Parties build their base at grassroots level; Mr Erdogan himself gained power after being mayor of Istanbul. He turned this poll into, in effect, a referendum on himself. Now his image of invincibility has been broken and an opposition long seen as hopelessly divided has got a new lease of life. Swathes of Turkey still adore Mr Erdogan, but the half of the country that detests its polarising president are starting to believe he's beatable. This was the first municipal vote since Mr Erdogan assumed sweeping executive powers through last year's presidential election. The AKP, with its roots in political Islam, has won every election since coming to power in 2002. Mr Erdogan, whose two-month campaign included 100 rallies, said the poll was about the ""survival"" of the country and his party. AKP supporters also celebrated in Istanbul - but Mr Erdogan later hinted that the party may have lost control there With most media either pro-government or controlled by Mr Erdogan's supporters, critics believe opposition parties campaigned at a disadvantage. Mr Erdogan's rallies dominated TV coverage. The opposition pro-Kurdish Peoples' Democratic Party (HDP) said the elections were unfair and refused to put forward candidates in several cities. Some of its leaders have been jailed on terrorism charges, accusations they reject. Why is Turkey fighting the markets?

Knife crime: More stop and search powers for police Surgeons who want you to touch knife crime The teenagers living in fear of knives The government says its plan is intended to ""help spot the warning signs that a young person could be in danger, such as presenting in A&E with suspicious injury, to worrying behaviour at school or issues at home"". Mr Javid called violent crime ""a disease rotting our society"" and said he was ""committed to ending this scourge"". ""The public health, multi-agency approach has a proven track record and I'm confident that making it a legal duty will help stop this senseless violence and create long-term change,"" he added. Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Children's Commissioner for England Anne Longfield said agencies such as schools ""don't often feel that they've got the tools or the systems"" to know what to do with children who might be involved in, or at risk of, violent crime. She added: ""We've got to think of more creative and effective ways to help these children."" Teachers' leaders are highly sceptical about these knife crime proposals - suggesting it's a way of avoiding thornier questions such as the number of police on the streets. Heads and teachers say they don't understand how in practice schools would be held ""accountable"" for reporting those at risk of knife crime. ""It is hard to see how it would be either workable or reasonable to make teachers accountable,"" says Geoff Barton, leader of the ASCL head teachers' union. ""What sort of behaviour would they be expected to report and who would they report to?"" he says. Schools are at risk of getting caught in a blame-game over knife crime, says Chris Keates, leader of the NASUWT teachers' union, who warns of teachers being ""scapegoated"". If teachers were to face sanctions over spotting those at risk, she says it would create a ""culture of defensive reporting"", in which the police and social services would be swamped by referrals. Majella Fergus, 53, a biology teacher at a secondary school in Cumbria, told the BBC that in recent years both the government and parents had tried to transfer their responsibilities ""onto the shoulders of teachers"". ""Adding yet another non-teaching responsibility to the shoulders of strained teachers and squashed teaching time grinds us down further,"" she said. ""Knife crime is a much wider societal issue and it isn't just simply going to be fought by teachers."" Majella Fergus told the BBC she felt the government was trying to shirk its responsibilities The Home Office announcement comes a day after Mr Javidhanded the police greater stop and search powersto tackle rising knife crime in England. With 285 deaths from stabbings in 2017-18, the most ever recorded in the UK,ministers have come under increasing pressure to tackle knife crime. As well as hosting the summit on youth violence in England and Wales, which starts on Monday, Prime Minister Theresa May will meet privately with families affected by knife crime. Mrs May said that while strong law enforcement ""plays an important role"", she added that communities need to look at what they can do to safeguard young people. ""That is why our plans to introduce a whole community - or 'public health' - approach are designed to identify more young people at risk,"" she said. More than 100 experts will meet at Downing Street during the week to discuss the issue. The consultation, which is open to the public and professionals across the UK, will run until May 28.

"This video can not be played Reiwa: Naming a new era in Japan Japan has announced that the name of its new imperial era, set to begin on 1 May, will be ""Reiwa"" - signifying order and harmony. The country's current era, Heisei, will end in a month with Emperor Akihito's historic abdication. Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga announced the highly anticipated name by holding up a board with the characters handwritten on it. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has addressed the nation to explain its meaning. Each Japanese emperor's reign is given a name, or ""gengo"", that is then used alongside the Western calendar to mark the years. The term for the new era is made up of the two characters Rei and Wa. Rei can mean ""commands"" or ""order"", as well as ""auspicious"" or ""good"". Wa often means ""harmony"", and is also used in the Japanese word for ""peace"" - ""hei-wa"". Japan's Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga unveils the new era name ""Reiwa"" at a press conference It is the first time an era name has been taken from an old anthology of Japanese poems, the Manyoshu, instead of a Chinese one, Mr Abe said. The Manyoshu symbolises Japan's ""profound public culture and long tradition"", he said. ""Our nation is facing up to a big turning point, but there are lots of Japanese values that shouldn't fade away,"" Mr Abe told reporters. The Manyoshu, which dates back to the 8th Century, depicts the auspicious month (""reigetsu"") in early spring when the winds have become temperate (""fu-wa""). There have been only four eras in Japan's modern history. Emperor Akihito's current gengo, Heisei, which means ""achieving peace"", was preceded by the Showa era (1926-1989), which can be translated as ""enlightened harmony"". Before that, the Taisho era (1912-1926) meant ""great righteousness"", while the Meiji era (1868-1912) meant ""enlightened rule"" in English. Crown Prince Naruhito will become emperor on 1 May, 2019 New emperor, new era: How a single word defines Japan The princess, the palace and the shrinking royal line Ten things about Japan's emperor Each era name aims to set the tone for the upcoming decades, and remains significant to most Japanese in their daily life. The gengo appears on coins, newspapers, driving licences and official paperwork. Monday's unveiling of the name follows weeks of speculation and top-secret cabinet discussions. The term was eventually chosen from a selection drawn up by a panel of scholars and experts. Although still widely used, the gengo calendar is declining in popularity as Japan opens up to global influence. According to a recent survey in Japan's Mainichi newspaper, a third of people mostly used the gengo system, compared to 82% in 1975, while 25% preferred the Western calendar. Since both calendars use Western months, many people simply use them alongside each other. Emperor Akihito, seen here with Empress Michiko, has said his age has made it difficult to fulfil duties Japan's government confirmed in December 2017 that the current emperor, 85-year old Akihito, would abdicate in April 2019due to old age and hand the throne to his son, Crown Prince Naruhito. He will be the first Japanese emperor to do so in more than two centuries. Usually, a new era is revealed only when one emperor has died and his successor has taken the throne. Things are different this time round, however, due to the abdication. The announcement was made one month early so government offices and companies can update computer software and prepare for the transition before it comes into effect next month.

"In Berlin on Sunday, demonstrators held aloft EU and UK flags - and the German word for ""friends"" The EU is closely watching the indicative votes process in the UK parliament today. EU leaders would, of course, welcome a softer Brexit. It would ease friction in post-Brexit EU-UK trade relations â but at the same time, they believe MPs are out of touch with reality. However many Brexit options are voted on today in the House of Commons, EU law stipulates that there are only three on the table: no deal, no Brexit, or Theresa May's negotiated deal. Any other form of Brexit requires the much-disliked Withdrawal Agreement - rejected once again by MPs on Friday - to be passed first. The EU is prevented by law from negotiating future trade relations with an existing member state. That is why the UK needs to leave first in order to start these negotiations. EU leaders understand the reluctance of MPs to enter into a so-called ""blind Brexit"", where you don't know what the future holds. The political declaration document, accompanying the Withdrawal Agreement, is there to give an idea of what might come next. The key word is ""might"". Chief whip attacks cabinet's Brexit strategy EU leaders plan for no deal as other options dissolve Brexit: A really simple guide Yes, if MPs unite around a softer Brexit and if Theresa May accepts that wish and communicates it to the EU, Brussels says it can amend the political declaration in a jiffy. But - and this is where the EU believing MPs are out of touch with reality really kicks in - the political declaration is just that: a declaration. It is not legally binding. The withdrawal agreement - what it all means So a future UK prime minister could opt for a very different Brexit when trade negotiations actually start. Which is probably why one of the options being put forward to be voted on today (from Conservative MP Ken Clarke) reads: ""Make it UK law to negotiate a customs union with EU"". Mr Clarke is seeking to restrict the power of the future prime minister to row back on parliament's will if MPs unite around a softer Brexit. But time is running out â again. The EU has given the UK until 10 April, when it will hold an emergency Brexit summit, to decide what next or to slip - however unintentionally - into a no-deal Brexit. On Monday, European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker said EU patience was running out. It's hardly a surprising comment, nor the first time an EU leader has said something similar. But it goes without saying that the EU wishes MPs had done their Brexit soul-searching, decision-making and recognition of impending trade-offs long before now - the 11th, 12th, or 13th hour.

"EasyJet has warned that customer demand for ticket sales for the next six months - which includes the peak summer season - is unexpectedly weak. The airline blamed uncertainty over the global economy and Brexit for the slowdown in forward bookings. As a result, EasyJet said it was now more cautious over its outlook for the second half of its financial year. The airline has already said it expects to make a loss of around Â£275m for the first half of the year. EasyJet's shares fell almost 8% in early trading following the release of its trading update, which had originally been due for release on Friday. ""We are seeing softness in both the UK and Europe, which we believe comes from macroeconomic uncertainty and many unanswered questions surrounding Brexit which are together driving weaker customer demand,"" said chief executive Johan Lundgren. Despite its caution, EasyJet said revenue per seat - a key measure for airlines - would be slightly higher in the second half of the year, while cost per seat would remain flat. Mr Lundgren said the airline was ""operationally well prepared for Brexit"", adding that ""whatever happens, we'll be flying as usual"". It has established EasyJet Europe, with headquarters in Vienna, which will enable EasyJet to continue to operate flights both across the EU and domestically within EU countries regardless of the Brexit outcome. Hargreaves Lansdown analyst George Salmon said the airline was being affected by issues out of its control. ""Higher fuel costs are hitting profits and with Brexit potentially impacting travel regulations and currency markets, customers are understandably waiting for more certainty before booking trips away. ""The group reckons demand will pick up later in the year, but a more pragmatic observer would say it's difficult to put a timeframe on when Westminster and the EU 27 will solve the Brexit puzzle."" EasyJet's warning comes amid a tough time for the airline industry, with a combination of factors such as higher fuel bills and excess capacity in the sector contributing to its problems. Last week,Iceland's Wow Air collapsed. Earlier this year, Germany's Germania filed for bankruptcy, and UK regional airline Flybmi stopped flying in February. The UK's struggling Flybe was taken over earlier this month for just one penny a share. Even giant budget airline Ryanair reported its first quarterly loss since March 2014 last month.

"Doan Thi Huong would have faced the death penalty if convicted of murder A Vietnamese woman accused of killing Kim Jong-nam, the half-brother of North Korea's leader, has pleaded guilty to a lesser charge of causing hurt by potentially deadly means. A Malaysian court sentenced Doan Thi Huong to three years and four months in jail, starting from her arrest in February 2017. However, under Malaysian law she could be freed by May, her lawyer said. Ms Huong would have faced the death penalty if found guilty of the murder. Mr Kim, the estranged half-brother of Kim Jong-un, was assassinated at Kuala Lumpur Airport in 2017 in broad daylight, with the toxic nerve agent VX. The development effectively means no-one has been held accountable for Mr Kim's death. ""In the first week of May, she will go home,"" Ms Huong's lawyer Hisyam Teh Poh Teik told reporters at the Shah Alam court, outside Malaysia's capital. Her step-mother Nguyen Thi Vy told BBC Vietnamese the family was ""very happy"". ""We have felt so thankful for all the support from the government, lawyers and communities,"" she said. The judge's decision comes after Ms Huong's Indonesian co-defendant Siti Aisyah unexpectedly walked free last month, after intervention from Malaysia's Attorney General. Kim murder suspect 'shocked' by release Unravelling Kim Jong-nam's mysterious death The women accused of killing Kim Jong-nam Ms Huong's hopes of a similar outcome were initially dashed on 14 March, when authorities rejected her request for the murder charge to be dropped and said her trial would go ahead. She cried in the courtroom, and told reporters: ""Only God knows that we did not commit the murder. I want my family to pray for me."" On 14 March, Ms Huong's lawyer said she had been unable to sleep since the unexpected release of her co-defendant, Siti Aisyah Both women have always insisted they were innocent. They say they were tricked into carrying out the killing - which involved smearing a lethal nerve agent on the victim's face - and believed they were part of a reality TV prank. The BBC's South East Asia correspondent Jonathan Head says Monday's verdict offers Malaysia a face-saving way out of an embarrassing murder trial, but will also be viewed by many as justice for the last remaining defendant. However, it means neither defendant was able to testify and give details of how they were brought into the plot, or who recruited them. Kim Jong-nam had been waiting to board a flight from Kuala Lumpur to Macau on 13 February 2017, when two women approached him in the departure area. CCTV footage showed one of them placing her hands over his face, then both women leaving the scene. Mr Kim died on the way to hospital from what was later found to be exposure to VX, one of the most toxic of all known chemical agents. North Korea has fiercely denied any involvement in the killing, but four men - believed to be North Koreans who fled Malaysia on the day of the murder - have also been charged in the case. They remain at large despite an Interpol ""red notice"", equivalent to an international arrest warrant. This video can not be played While in prison, Siti Aisyah wondered: ""Is this the end of my life?""

"Ayla's mum believes she may have caused brain damage by banging her head in her secure unit ""She is so desperate to end it all, she currently has a toothbrush inside her."" Jane Haines is talking about her daughter, Ayla, who has been in secure units for people with learning difficulties for seven years. A government programme to move people out of these units after an abuse scandal is a failure, campaigners say. The government said in 2015 it was committed to reducing inpatient numbers in England by at least 35%, although it has only relocated 20% so far. That means 2,000 patients remain in them and the government has extended the original March 2019 deadline to 2020. Jane's daughter was admitted to an Assessment and Treatment Unit (ATU) at 19, after struggling with anorexia and other mental health issues. These secure units treat vulnerable young people who are deemed to be a danger to themselves. Patients are supposed to be admitted for nine to 18 months, but the average stay is more than five years. Ayla has spent the past seven years as an inpatient and is currently living in Northamptonshire, more than 200 miles away from her home in Carmarthen. Jane tells theBBC's Victoria Derbyshire programmeit has led to desperate behaviour, including swallowing a toothbrush, which is still in her body 10 months later. ""She's got a huge bald patch on her head where her hair will never grow back, from all the head banging she's done,"" she says. ""One of the doctors said possibly she's caused more brain damage. ""We are powerless and have to sit back and watch her suffer,"" says Ayla's grandmother Judy Haines. ""It's torture for her and for us."" Jane says she is not critical of the place where Ayla is being treated, rather the system. The ATU where she is staying said it was unable to provide comment on an individual case. But it said it, ""works with every individual to design a package of care around them, to keep them safe and help them progress back to the community"". ATUs came under scrutiny in 2011after the BBC's Panorama exposed horrific abuse of patients at Winterbourne View. The government promised to end their use for those capable of living in the community with proper support through a programme called Transforming Care - which cost Â£10m. Linda Hutchings' daughter is in a secure unit in the East Midlands Dan Scorer, head of policy at Mencap, said: ""People are spending many, many years in there, they shouldn't be. Awful things are happening to people in there and they shouldn't be. ""And in the same way asylums were closed, these places need to be closed and people need to be supported in the community."" NHS figures show an increase in staff resorting to medication, seclusion and even restraint when dealing with patients. Of the 2,500 incidents reported in December last year alone, 800 were against children under the age of 18. Learning disabilities care 'far from home' 'Shameful' use of restraints on disabled patients Failings in learning disability deaths, report finds Linda and Chris Hutchings' 27-year-old daughter lives in a secure unit in the East Midlands. She was sectioned, aged 14, after battling with an eating disorder and depression. Her mum, Linda, says: ""I wake up in the middle of the night and I am crying because I am so sad. ""In one of the hospitals [not the one she is currently in] she was locked in one room for nine weeks, and it was so awful for her because there was nothing apart from a telly on a high bracket on the wall."" Chris says: ""Can you even envisage another situation where a human being is locked up on the presumption of guilt? On what they might do to themselves or others? You lose that basic right to be free."" Birmingham City Council, which is responsible for their daughter's care, also said it could not comment on individual cases, adding, ""there are always safeguarding measures in place when somebody's liberty is limited due to illness or disability"". Experts say the average placement cost of keeping one person in an ATU is more than Â£3,000 per week. Shahana Hussain says her niece's care has been transformed since she left a secure unit Labour's shadow care minister, Barbara Keeley, said the government was allowing private companies to make millions, because the ATUs cost five times the amount of a community placement. ""They are like the Bedlam institutions in Victorian times,"" she said. ""This is a hidden horror. There have been 40 deaths in these units in 2015, nine of those were people under 35."" She said the government should make a new pledge to close them down. A Department of Health spokesman said: ""We are determined to reduce the number of people on the autism spectrum with learning disabilities in mental health hospitals, and significant investment in community support has already led to a 20% reduction. ""The NHS is committed to reducing inpatient numbers by 35% by 2020."" But with the right support, some parents say that the government's transformation care programme can work. Fauzia Hussain, who has Tourette's and autism, spent 22 months in a secure unit. Her family says that she was prescribed high doses of medication, including anti-psychotic drugs and kept mostly in segregation. Since she has left, her life has since been transformed. ""It was a hopeless place. I'm a child psychiatrist and I couldn't access the right support,"" her aunt Shahana says. ""I'm aware of so many families who haven't been quite so lucky. I live in fear that Fauzia might end up back in a place like that."" Follow the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme onFacebook,externalandTwitter,external- and see more of our storieshere.

"Five UK broadband and landline providers will now automatically compensate customers when services do not work. From Monday, customers who experience delayed repairs, installations or missed engineer appointments will be compensated, without having to ask. BT, Sky, TalkTalk, Virgin Media and Zen Internet have joined Ofcom's scheme, which is not compulsory. Hyperoptic, Vodafone, EE and Plusnet have also committed to the plans. According to industry watchdog Ofcom, there are 7.2 million cases each year where broadband or landline customers suffer delayed repairs, installations or missed appointments. Previously, only about one in seven broadband or landline customers received compensation from providers for these delays. Ofcom consulted on enforcing formal regulations regarding compensation of broadband and landline services in 2017. However, some service providers then approached the regulator independently and offered to pay compensation to customers. This led to Ofcom releasing details of its voluntary automatic compensation code of practice in November 2017. ""We think it's unacceptable that people should be kept waiting for a new line, or a fault to be fixed,"" said Ofcom's chief executive Sharon White. She added that the new rules would provide an incentive for service providers to want to avoid problems occurring in the first place. ""But if they fall short, customers must be treated fairly and given money back, without having to ask for it,"" she said. TalkTalk, Sky, Zen Internet and BT all use BT's Openreach network to provide broadband and landline services. In December,the providers agreed a deal with Openreachthat if any delays to repairs or installations occurred, Openreach would compensate the providers. The providers would then use that money to automatically compensate their customers. Under the terms of the agreement, if an engineer does not arrive on schedule, or cancels within 24 hours, the compensation will be Â£25. If a service stops working and is not fully fixed after two working days, customers will be entitled to Â£8 a day in compensation. There will also be Â£5-per-day offered for new services not starting on time. Hyperoptic and Vodafone will begin automatic compensation later this year, while EE plans to start paying compensation automatically in 2020. Plusnet has committed to the scheme, but has not provided a timescale for when it will begin providing automatic compensation. Asked why Ofcom had chosen not to implement formal regulations for automatic compensation, an Ofcom spokesman told the BBC: ""This is the quickest way of putting money back in people's pockets. All the largest firms have committed, with more than 95% of households covered."" He said that customers with providers not in the scheme from Monday could choose to switch to a new provider if they were unhappy with their current service. However, Ofcom added that it was keeping ""a close eye"" on the firms in the scheme. ""If they don't comply, we'll step in and take action,"" the spokesman said.

"EasyJet has warned that customer demand for ticket sales for the next six months - which includes the peak summer season - is unexpectedly weak. The airline blamed uncertainty over the global economy and Brexit for the slowdown in forward bookings. As a result, EasyJet said it was now more cautious over its outlook for the second half of its financial year. The airline has already said it expects to make a loss of around Â£275m for the first half of the year. EasyJet's shares fell almost 8% in early trading following the release of its trading update, which had originally been due for release on Friday. ""We are seeing softness in both the UK and Europe, which we believe comes from macroeconomic uncertainty and many unanswered questions surrounding Brexit which are together driving weaker customer demand,"" said chief executive Johan Lundgren. Despite its caution, EasyJet said revenue per seat - a key measure for airlines - would be slightly higher in the second half of the year, while cost per seat would remain flat. Mr Lundgren said the airline was ""operationally well prepared for Brexit"", adding that ""whatever happens, we'll be flying as usual"". It has established EasyJet Europe, with headquarters in Vienna, which will enable EasyJet to continue to operate flights both across the EU and domestically within EU countries regardless of the Brexit outcome. Hargreaves Lansdown analyst George Salmon said the airline was being affected by issues out of its control. ""Higher fuel costs are hitting profits and with Brexit potentially impacting travel regulations and currency markets, customers are understandably waiting for more certainty before booking trips away. ""The group reckons demand will pick up later in the year, but a more pragmatic observer would say it's difficult to put a timeframe on when Westminster and the EU 27 will solve the Brexit puzzle."" EasyJet's warning comes amid a tough time for the airline industry, with a combination of factors such as higher fuel bills and excess capacity in the sector contributing to its problems. Last week,Iceland's Wow Air collapsed. Earlier this year, Germany's Germania filed for bankruptcy, and UK regional airline Flybmi stopped flying in February. The UK's struggling Flybe was taken over earlier this month for just one penny a share. Even giant budget airline Ryanair reported its first quarterly loss since March 2014 last month.

By BBC Music reporter Mark Savage ""Out the garage is how you end up in charge/It's how you end up in penthouses, end up in cars/With sweat drippin' down your face 'cause the mission was hard."" - Nipsey Hussle, Last Time That I Checc'd In music as in life, Nipsey Hussle stressed the importance of independence and economic mobility. He took 10 years to release his debut album, Victory Lap, rejecting major label cash to build his own empire one dollar at a time. Famously, he sold 1,000 copies of his 2013 Crenshaw mixtape for $100 - even persuading Jay-Z to buy 100 copies - giving him the financial security he needed to pursue music on his own terms. That music was heavily indebted to the West Coast rap he grew up with in the Crenshaw neighbourhood of Los Angeles, from where he embarked on his journey from the streets to the major league. Hussle never hid the fact he'd been a long-time member of LA's notorious Rollin' 60s Crips, but his croaky-voiced raps about shoot-outs and drug deals were always haunted by the ghosts of those who got left behind. On one of Victory Lap's stand-out tracks, Dedication, Kendrick Lamar urged people to look beyond Hussle's gang days, stressing: ""He a man first, you hear the words out his lips/about flourishing from the streets to black businesses?"" It was a perfect encapsulation of the musician's mission statement. ""Me being a human comes before me being an artist,""he told Billboard last year,external. ""I want to affect change and I want to impact the communities that I grew up in, and the ones like it."" Paying his own tribute, hip hop mogul Diddy said Nipsey ""represents change, he represents evolution, he represents everything our culture needs to embrace"". Allow Twitter content?

"This video can not be played BBC Middle East Editor on bowel cancer diagnosis BBC Middle East editor Jeremy Bowen has revealed he has been diagnosed with bowel cancer. The former BBC Breakfast host said he was undergoing chemotherapy after noticing ""funny pains in my legs and in my back"" whilst in Iraq last May. April is bowel cancer awareness month and Bowen shared his diagnosis to encourage others to get tested. Bowel cancerscreening in England and Wales is to start earlier, at age 50, bringing them in line with Scotland. Alagiah 'overwhelmed' by viewers' support Half of over 60s 'ignore bowel screening' Health screening 'not meeting targets' Doctors initially believed the veteran journalist's pain was due to scarring from previous surgery, he told BBC Breakfast, the show which he presented alongside Sophie Raworth between 2000 and 2002. ""I had no symptoms - none of the classic bowel cancer symptoms. Nothing at all. But I thought I should get a test,"" the 59-year-old said. Jeremy Bowen and Sophie Raworth on BBC Breakfast in 2000 Bowen said he received a positive result and had a colonoscopy - a camera inserted into his colon to look for signs of cancer. ""It [the colonoscopy] is not nearly as bad as it sounds - they give you lots of drugs,"" he said. Surgeons found a tumour, which they removed, and he started chemotherapy, he said. Bowen, born in Cardiff, and a BBC journalist for 35 years, said his diagnosis ""could have been earlier, but had it been later it would have been much more serious"". Bowel cancer is the fourth most common cancer in the UK, with 42,000 people diagnosed every year. 'I can't die yet, I'm only 29' Stephen Fry recovering from cancer op More than 16,000 people die from the disease in the country annually, according toBowel Cancer UK,external. In England, Wales and Northern Ireland, people between the ages of 60 and 75 are invited to be screened for bowel cancer every two years. In Scotland, screening starts at age 50. Following recommendations from experts, NHS England and NHS Wales last year said they would start screening at the earlier age of 50. But, according to Bowel Cancer UK, a firm date for the change has not yet been set. The chief executive of the charity, Deborah Alsina, told BBC Breakfast that Bowen would have been tested at least three times by the time he was diagnosed, if the standard screening age had been 50. Bowen said: ""The key thing is - get tested. I've been saying to all my friends - get tested. ""Things to do with your bowels and poo ... are not things people normally want to talk about. But actually it's part of all our lives and you need to work on it."" He said a gastroenterologist had told him: ""Don't die of embarrassment, for God's sake."" bleeding from your bottom and/or blood in your poo a persistent and unexplained change in bowel habit unexplained weight loss extreme tiredness for no obvious reason a pain or lump in your tummy Bowen said the chemotherapy ""is not nearly as bad as I thought it would be in terms of side effects, but it affects people differently and I think I've just been quite lucky to tolerate it better than I expected"". ""You've got to keep positive about things in life. It's all part of the journey, as they say on Strictly [Come Dancing],"" he added.

"Home Secretary Sajid Javid wants to make it a legal duty to report concerns over at-risk young people Teachers, NHS workers and police officers in England and Wales could be held accountable for failing to spot violent crime among young people under government plans announced on Monday. Home Secretary Sajid Javid has launched a consultation to assess whether there is a ""public health duty"" to report concerns over children at risk. He said he will use ""all the tools"" at his disposal to end violent crime. But unions for teachers and NHS staff have raised concerns about the plans. A summit on serious youth violence is being held at Downing Street this week. Dr Mary Bousted, joint general secretary of the National Education Union, said: ""Neither the blame for, or the solution to, violent crime can be laid at the door of schools or front-line hospital staff."" She said schools already had ""strong safeguarding practices in place"" and added: ""The problem is what happens after issues of concern have been identified."" The Royal College of Nursing, meanwhile, expressed concerns that obligations to report people involved in violent crime could deter people ""from seeking help for fear of being reported"". Knife crime: More stop and search powers for police Surgeons who want you to touch knife crime The teenagers living in fear of knives The government says its plan is intended to ""help spot the warning signs that a young person could be in danger, such as presenting in A&E with suspicious injury, to worrying behaviour at school or issues at home"". Mr Javid called violent crime ""a disease rotting our society"" and said he was ""committed to ending this scourge"". ""The public health, multi-agency approach has a proven track record and I'm confident that making it a legal duty will help stop this senseless violence and create long-term change,"" he added. Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Children's Commissioner for England Anne Longfield said agencies such as schools ""don't often feel that they've got the tools or the systems"" to know what to do with children who might be involved in, or at risk of, violent crime. She added: ""We've got to think of more creative and effective ways to help these children."" Teachers' leaders are highly sceptical about these knife crime proposals - suggesting it's a way of avoiding thornier questions such as the number of police on the streets. Heads and teachers say they don't understand how in practice schools would be held ""accountable"" for reporting those at risk of knife crime. ""It is hard to see how it would be either workable or reasonable to make teachers accountable,"" says Geoff Barton, leader of the ASCL head teachers' union. ""What sort of behaviour would they be expected to report and who would they report to?"" he says. Schools are at risk of getting caught in a blame-game over knife crime, says Chris Keates, leader of the NASUWT teachers' union, who warns of teachers being ""scapegoated"". If teachers were to face sanctions over spotting those at risk, she says it would create a ""culture of defensive reporting"", in which the police and social services would be swamped by referrals. Majella Fergus, 53, a biology teacher at a secondary school in Cumbria, told the BBC that in recent years both the government and parents had tried to transfer their responsibilities ""onto the shoulders of teachers"". ""Adding yet another non-teaching responsibility to the shoulders of strained teachers and squashed teaching time grinds us down further,"" she said. ""Knife crime is a much wider societal issue and it isn't just simply going to be fought by teachers."" Majella Fergus told the BBC she felt the government was trying to shirk its responsibilities The Home Office announcement comes a day after Mr Javidhanded the police greater stop and search powersto tackle rising knife crime in England. With 285 deaths from stabbings in 2017-18, the most ever recorded in the UK,ministers have come under increasing pressure to tackle knife crime. As well as hosting the summit on youth violence in England and Wales, which starts on Monday, Prime Minister Theresa May will meet privately with families affected by knife crime. Mrs May said that while strong law enforcement ""plays an important role"", she added that communities need to look at what they can do to safeguard young people. ""That is why our plans to introduce a whole community - or 'public health' - approach are designed to identify more young people at risk,"" she said. More than 100 experts will meet at Downing Street during the week to discuss the issue. The consultation, which is open to the public and professionals across the UK, will run until May 28.

"The jet crashed while landing near Frankfurt The co-owner of Russia's second biggest airline died when her private plane crashed in Germany, the firm says. Natalia Fileva, one of Russia's richest women and the major shareholder in S7, also known as Siberia Airlines, died when the plane crashed while landing at Egelsbach airport near Frankfurt. Another passenger and the pilot also died in the crash, German media quoted local authorities as saying. The cause of the crash has not yet been identified, S7 said. The private jet was flying from Cannes in France. It disappeared from radars at 13:22 GMT (15:22 local time), according to flight tracker Flightradar24. Ms Fileva, 55, had wealth valued at $600m (Â£460m) according to Forbes magazine. ""The S7 Group holding team expresses deepest condolences to the family and significant others,"" the company said. Russian and international authorities would investigate the crash, S7 added. Meanwhile two other people died when a police vehicle travelling to the scene of the crash collided with another car near the airport. The three police officers in the police car suffered serious injuries, DPA reported. S7 is the main competitor in Russia to Aeroflot. It has 96 aircraft that fly to 181 cities and towns in 26 countries, the company's website says.

"This video can not be played Liz talks about the moment her son was permanently excluded from school A mother has called for more help for parents of children removed from schools, saying she was left ""bewildered"" when her son was excluded. Liz's son was out of school for six months and later diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). The most recent figures for 2016-17 show a 51% rise in pupils permanently excluded from schools in Wales. A teacher's leader said numbers were low and decisions were taken seriously. Liz, who lives in Bridgend county, said problems began when her son started secondary school at a time when his father had moved out of the area and his grandfather had died. Liz picks up the story. ""When he started secondary school he wasn't settling, he found it overwhelming I think. Then he had his appendix out, he was quite poorly and when he went back, he'd fallen so far behind, that's when his behaviour really deteriorated. Reality Check: Why are 1,000 children being expelled? What is it like to be excluded from school? ""It started off fairly small things - disturbing the class, making funny noises. Then it got to the point he was getting up in class, wandering around, distracting the other children which then went on to leaving the classroom, running around the school, no respect for the teachers. ""For him, he saw school as a big game. I was constantly angry with him, getting calls at work to collect him from school - it was on a daily basis. I just wanted him to stop, I put punishments in place and tried grounding him, but it was a constant battle. It was horrific. ""The school weren't helpful in any way. The exclusion started, maybe one day or two days a week. ""In between he was playing truant. When he was there he was causing absolute chaos. I believed he needed counselling - that never happened, they [the school] said they tried it with a teacher. ""The first day of his second year, he went to school. I had a call to say he'd really gone on a 'jolly', teachers were looking for him and he was going to be permanently excluded. I was so upset. He came in the house and went upstairs. His head was bowed and he said: ""Mum, I don't understand why I do the things I do,"". And I cuddled him. There was nothing else to do but hold him. ""A social worker got involved and managed to help get him into another school [10 miles away]. That school really tried with him - it was hands on from the minute he got there and that was the first time then words about his diagnosis [ADHD] were used. But he couldn't cope with mainstream school - me and the head of year made the decision to remove him because it was hurting him. He'd made so many improvements but it was hurting him. ""He was feeling low. I remember him saying ""what's going to happen to me mum?"" It broke my heart and I said: ""You're going to be fine."" ""He did worry. This wasn't a child who didn't want to do anything with school. ""He's now at a different school - for children like him, children with other conditions and disabilities."" From an initial two hours a day he is now back at school full time. ""From that day to this, what a change in the boy - the school are marvellous with him. He still has his off days but he's come on so much."" Far fewer pupils are permanently excluded than in the middle of the 2000s.Guidance was issued by the Welsh Government in 2012,external, setting out how exclusions should be used and to do so permanently should be only a ""final step"" in the disciplinary process. But both the numbers - and rate - of permanent school exclusions have jumped in the last year. Some pupils - like Liz's son - are excluded for persistent behaviour issues. But violence or supplying drugs are two reasons why a pupil might be permanently excluded for a first or one-off offence. Dr April May Kitchener runs Siarad Da, which works with some children who have been excluded and their families. She said that there are big differences in the way schools approach exclusions, with some offering more pastoral support than others. ""We are seeing children with challenging behaviour because of learning difficulties experiencing greater levels of exclusion but we are also seeing lower levels of tolerance for these children as well particularly in a school which is pushing very hard to show how well it's doing academically,"" she said. Tim Pratt, director of the Association of School and College Leaders Cymru, said: ""The rate of exclusions has increased at a time of intense funding pressure on schools in Wales. ""This makes it more difficult to provide the early intervention which prevents behavioural issues from escalating to the point of exclusion, and this is therefore likely to result in an increase in the number of exclusions."" Knife crime: Are school exclusions to blame? Mental health issues blamed for exclusion rise Why has Scotland's exclusion rate dropped? He added: ""Even so, the rate of exclusions, and particularly permanent exclusions, remains low, reflecting the fact that these decisions are taken extremely seriously and only after a great deal of thought and consideration."" Mr Pratt said it was sometimes necessary to permanently exclude in the best interests of other pupils, while excluded pupils could also benefit from a fresh start elsewhere. Liz said looking back, the experience was ""bewildering"" and ""a hard two years"" for her son. ""There was no help in place - he was off school for six months and I still had to work, a lot of times that boy was on his own, he was down, he was very unhappy. She said she ""doesn't understand the logic behind it - your child is really naughty we're going to move him on, it'll be someone else's problem. How does that ever help the child?"" A Bridgend council spokesman said supporting the best possible outcomes for children was a priority. ""A clear and agreed process is followed when permanent exclusions are issued by schools,"" he said. ""They are always a last resort, and exclusions had steadily decreased in recent years.""

"The new law will criminalise psychological abuse A new law has come into force that makes psychological domestic abuse and controlling behaviour a crime. It will be supported by a Scottish government awareness campaign aimed at improving public understanding of the wide-ranging nature of the problem. The Scottish Parliamentpassed the Domestic Abuse Actin February last year. Police Scotland said officers have been given extra training in preparation for the change in law. The legislation covers not just physical abuse, but psychological and emotional treatment and coercive and controlling behaviour, where abusers isolate their victim from their friends and relatives or control their finances. It takes account of the full breadth of violent, threatening, intimidating and other controlling behaviour which can destroy a victim's autonomy and further recognises the adverse impact domestic abuse can have on children. The new legislation says abusive behaviour is: Behaviour that is violent, threatening or intimidating Behaviour whose purpose is one of the following: making a partner dependent or subordinate isolating a partner from friends, relatives or other sources of support controlling, regulating or monitoring a partner's day-to-day activities depriving a partner of, or restricting, freedom of action frightening, humiliating, degrading or punishing a partner. The offence is aggravated if any of the behaviour is directed at a child or witnessed by them. The Act also requires courts to consider imposing a non-harassment order on an offender convicted of a domestic abuse offence to protect their victim from further abuse. For police it means they can now include evidence of coercive and controlling behaviour where it forms a pattern alongside physical and sexual abuse. Justice Secretary Humza Yousaf said: ""The Domestic Abuse Act makes absolutely clear that coercive and controlling behaviour is domestic abuse and a crime. ""I am proud Scotland is leading the way with this groundbreaking legislation, which uniquely recognises the effect of domestic abuse on child victims as well as adults."" MSPs applauded domestic abuse survivors in the public gallery after the legislation was passed One survivor has urged anyone living with domestic abuse to seek help. Roshni, 29, left an abusive marriage with support from Hemat Gryffe Women's Aid in Glasgow. She said: ""At first the marriage was so good, but after a few months I realised there was something wrong. He didn't give me any money, so I always had to stay at home, I felt so isolated. ""He was always pushing me and abusing me in front of my family and friends. ""This was a really bad situation for me, I wanted to live with respect as a person. ""If you feel like you are in my situation being controlled or abused by your partner, seek help, it's your life."" Assistant Chief Constable Gillian MacDonald, crime and protection lead for Police Scotland, said: ""This new offence is groundbreaking. For the first time, it will allow us to investigate and report the full circumstances of an abusive relationship. ""In preparation for the change in law our officers and staff have received further training on the dynamics of power and control in abusive relationships to help recognise the signs, identify investigative opportunities and to tackle the myths and misconceptions of abuse that still exist. ""This new offence is a clear warning to abusers that all forms of domestic abuse are criminal and that perpetrators should expect to face the full consequences of their abusive behaviour.""

"This video can not be played Mr Zelensky spoke to the BBC after the exit polls were announced A comedian with no political experience has won the most votes in the first round of Ukraine's presidential elections, early results indicate. With half the ballots counted, Volodymyr Zelensky - who plays the president on TV - got  about 30%, with current leader Petro Poroshenko on 16%. The two - who have expressed largely pro-EU opinions - are set to take part in a run-off election next month. Former prime minister Yulia Tymoshenko appears to have been eliminated. What would a comic president mean for Ukraine? Funny business at the polls Pranked at a fake election rally ""I'm very happy but this is not the final action,"" Mr Zelensky told the BBC's Jonah Fisher, minutes after exit polls were announced.

The Ukrainian president has significant powers over security, defence and foreign policy, in a system described as semi-presidential. This video can not be played The comedian who could be president Mr Zelensky is aiming to turn his satirical TV show Servant of the People - in which he portrays an ordinary citizen who becomes president after fighting corruption - into reality. He has torn up the rulebook for election campaigning, staging no rallies and giving few interviews. He appears to have no strong political views apart from a wish to be new and different. His extensive use of social media appealed to younger voters. Mr Zelensky's readiness to speak both Russian and Ukrainian, at a time when language rights are a hugely sensitive topic, gained himsupport in Ukraine's largely Russian-speaking east,external. His Achilles heel, however, is his relationship with Ukraine's most controversial oligarch, Igor Kolomoisky, says our Kiev correspondent. Mr Kolomoisky is the owner of TV channel 1+1 - which has given fulsome support to Me Zelensky. The oligarch, who lives in self-imposed exile, faces numerous investigations in Ukraine into his business dealings. But Mr Zelensky has insisted he is ""no puppet"" of Mr Kolomoisky. Mr Poroshenko, a chocolate magnate and one of Ukraine's wealthiest people, was elected in a snap vote after former pro-Russian President Viktor Yanukovych was toppled in the February 2014 Maidan Revolution, which was followed by Russia's annexation of Crimea and a Russian-backed insurgency in the east. This video can not be played Ukraine's presidential elections: five things to know The next president will inherit a deadlocked conflict between Ukrainian troops and the eastern separatists, while Ukraine strives to fulfil EU requirements for closer economic ties. The EU says that about 12% of Ukraine's 44 million people are disenfranchised, largely those who live in Russia and in Crimea, which Russia annexed in March 2014. Mr Poroshenko aimed to appeal to conservative Ukrainians through his slogan ""Army, Language, Faith"". Petro Poroshenko voted with his wife He says his backing for the military has helped keep the separatists in check. He also negotiated an Association Agreement with the EU, including visa-free travel for Ukrainians. During his tenure the Ukrainian Orthodox Church has become independent of Russian control. However his campaign has been dogged by corruption allegations, includinga scandal over defence procurement,externalwhich erupted last month. Yulia Tymoshenko stood for president twice before Yulia Tymoshenko served as prime minister and ran for president in 2010 and 2014. She played a leading role in the 2004 Orange Revolution, Ukraine's first big push to ally itself with the EU.

"Opposition CHP supporters celebrated in Istanbul The party of Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has lost control of the capital, Ankara, in local elections, in a blow to his 16-year rule. The main opposition is also slightly ahead in the contest for mayor of Istanbul, figures published by the state-run Anadolu news agency suggest. But the president's AKP party is challenging the result in both cities. Municipal elections were held across the nation on Sunday and an AKP-led alliance won more than 51% of the vote. The elections, considered a verdict on Mr Erdogan's rule, have been taking place during an economic downturn. The currency, the lira, has been losing value recently and the economy went into recession in the last three months of 2018. Erdogan shows NZ attack video at rallies Why is Turkey fighting the markets? Erdogan: Turkey's pugnacious president The AKP - or Justice and Development Party - alleges ""invalid votes and irregularities in most of the 12,158 polling stations in Ankara"". Its general secretary, Fatih Sahin, said on Twitter: ""We will use our legal rights to the fullest, and we will not allow the will of our citizens to be altered in Ankara."" This video can not be played Erdogan: ""We will appeal wherever needed"" The AKP says it will also challenge the result in Istanbul - the largest city - and the eastern province of Igdir. Commenting on the results in a speech on Sunday, Mr Erdogan looked ahead to national elections in 2023: ""We have a long period ahead where we will carry out economic reforms without compromising on the rules of the free-market economy. ""If there are any shortcomings, it is our duty to correct them,"" he said. More than 57 million people in the country were registered to vote for mayors and councillors. Turnout was high at just under 85%. The opposition Republican People's Party (CHP) candidate Mansur Yavas won in Ankara, officials said. With almost all votes counted, he was on nearly 51% and the AKP's Mehmet Ozhaseki had won the support of just over 47%. Both CHP and the AKP claim victory in Istanbul, which has been in the hands of parties linked to Mr Erdogan since 1994, when he was elected the city's mayor. The election commission said the CHP's Ekrem Imamoglu was leading there by less than 0.5%, but that the results of more than 80 ballot boxes were being challenged. Results carried by Anadolu put the margin even narrower, at less than 0.25%. The CHP's mayoral candidate for Istanbul Ekrem Imamoglu has claimed victory by 28,000 votes The AKP had been saying its candidate, former Prime Minister Binali Yildirim, was ahead by 4,000 votes. He later conceded his opponent had a narrow lead, only for the AKP to again claim victory. The third largest city, Izmir, went to the CHP. ""The people have voted in favour of democracy. They have chosen democracy,"" CHP leader Kemal Kilicdaroglu said. Analysis by Mark Lowen, BBC Turkey correspondent Electoral figures show Istanbul falling to the opposition by a whisker, although the ruling party has challenged the result and refused to concede. Ekrem Imamoglu, who's already changed his Twitter profile to ""mayor of Istanbul"", has vowed to serve all sides - those who voted for and against him - without discrimination. President Erdogan's setbacks deepened elsewhere, losing the capital, Ankara, and several other cities as his conservative voters punished him for an economic crisis. Local elections are important here. Parties build their base at grassroots level; Mr Erdogan himself gained power after being mayor of Istanbul. He turned this poll into, in effect, a referendum on himself. Now his image of invincibility has been broken and an opposition long seen as hopelessly divided has got a new lease of life. Swathes of Turkey still adore Mr Erdogan, but the half of the country that detests its polarising president are starting to believe he's beatable. This was the first municipal vote since Mr Erdogan assumed sweeping executive powers through last year's presidential election. The AKP, with its roots in political Islam, has won every election since coming to power in 2002. Mr Erdogan, whose two-month campaign included 100 rallies, said the poll was about the ""survival"" of the country and his party. AKP supporters also celebrated in Istanbul - but Mr Erdogan later hinted that the party may have lost control there With most media either pro-government or controlled by Mr Erdogan's supporters, critics believe opposition parties campaigned at a disadvantage. Mr Erdogan's rallies dominated TV coverage. The opposition pro-Kurdish Peoples' Democratic Party (HDP) said the elections were unfair and refused to put forward candidates in several cities. Some of its leaders have been jailed on terrorism charges, accusations they reject. Why is Turkey fighting the markets?

"Ayla's mum believes she may have caused brain damage by banging her head in her secure unit ""She is so desperate to end it all, she currently has a toothbrush inside her."" Jane Haines is talking about her daughter, Ayla, who has been in secure units for people with learning difficulties for seven years. A government programme to move people out of these units after an abuse scandal is a failure, campaigners say. The government said in 2015 it was committed to reducing inpatient numbers in England by at least 35%, although it has only relocated 20% so far. That means 2,000 patients remain in them and the government has extended the original March 2019 deadline to 2020. Jane's daughter was admitted to an Assessment and Treatment Unit (ATU) at 19, after struggling with anorexia and other mental health issues. These secure units treat vulnerable young people who are deemed to be a danger to themselves. Patients are supposed to be admitted for nine to 18 months, but the average stay is more than five years. Ayla has spent the past seven years as an inpatient and is currently living in Northamptonshire, more than 200 miles away from her home in Carmarthen. Jane tells theBBC's Victoria Derbyshire programmeit has led to desperate behaviour, including swallowing a toothbrush, which is still in her body 10 months later. ""She's got a huge bald patch on her head where her hair will never grow back, from all the head banging she's done,"" she says. ""One of the doctors said possibly she's caused more brain damage. ""We are powerless and have to sit back and watch her suffer,"" says Ayla's grandmother Judy Haines. ""It's torture for her and for us."" Jane says she is not critical of the place where Ayla is being treated, rather the system. The ATU where she is staying said it was unable to provide comment on an individual case. But it said it, ""works with every individual to design a package of care around them, to keep them safe and help them progress back to the community"". ATUs came under scrutiny in 2011after the BBC's Panorama exposed horrific abuse of patients at Winterbourne View. The government promised to end their use for those capable of living in the community with proper support through a programme called Transforming Care - which cost Â£10m. Linda Hutchings' daughter is in a secure unit in the East Midlands Dan Scorer, head of policy at Mencap, said: ""People are spending many, many years in there, they shouldn't be. Awful things are happening to people in there and they shouldn't be. ""And in the same way asylums were closed, these places need to be closed and people need to be supported in the community."" NHS figures show an increase in staff resorting to medication, seclusion and even restraint when dealing with patients. Of the 2,500 incidents reported in December last year alone, 800 were against children under the age of 18. Learning disabilities care 'far from home' 'Shameful' use of restraints on disabled patients Failings in learning disability deaths, report finds Linda and Chris Hutchings' 27-year-old daughter lives in a secure unit in the East Midlands. She was sectioned, aged 14, after battling with an eating disorder and depression. Her mum, Linda, says: ""I wake up in the middle of the night and I am crying because I am so sad. ""In one of the hospitals [not the one she is currently in] she was locked in one room for nine weeks, and it was so awful for her because there was nothing apart from a telly on a high bracket on the wall."" Chris says: ""Can you even envisage another situation where a human being is locked up on the presumption of guilt? On what they might do to themselves or others? You lose that basic right to be free."" Birmingham City Council, which is responsible for their daughter's care, also said it could not comment on individual cases, adding, ""there are always safeguarding measures in place when somebody's liberty is limited due to illness or disability"". Experts say the average placement cost of keeping one person in an ATU is more than Â£3,000 per week. Shahana Hussain says her niece's care has been transformed since she left a secure unit Labour's shadow care minister, Barbara Keeley, said the government was allowing private companies to make millions, because the ATUs cost five times the amount of a community placement. ""They are like the Bedlam institutions in Victorian times,"" she said. ""This is a hidden horror. There have been 40 deaths in these units in 2015, nine of those were people under 35."" She said the government should make a new pledge to close them down. A Department of Health spokesman said: ""We are determined to reduce the number of people on the autism spectrum with learning disabilities in mental health hospitals, and significant investment in community support has already led to a 20% reduction. ""The NHS is committed to reducing inpatient numbers by 35% by 2020."" But with the right support, some parents say that the government's transformation care programme can work. Fauzia Hussain, who has Tourette's and autism, spent 22 months in a secure unit. Her family says that she was prescribed high doses of medication, including anti-psychotic drugs and kept mostly in segregation. Since she has left, her life has since been transformed. ""It was a hopeless place. I'm a child psychiatrist and I couldn't access the right support,"" her aunt Shahana says. ""I'm aware of so many families who haven't been quite so lucky. I live in fear that Fauzia might end up back in a place like that."" Follow the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme onFacebook,externalandTwitter,external- and see more of our storieshere.

"Opposition CHP supporters celebrated in Istanbul The party of Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has lost control of the capital, Ankara, in local elections, in a blow to his 16-year rule. The main opposition is also slightly ahead in the contest for mayor of Istanbul, figures published by the state-run Anadolu news agency suggest. But the president's AKP party is challenging the result in both cities. Municipal elections were held across the nation on Sunday and an AKP-led alliance won more than 51% of the vote. The elections, considered a verdict on Mr Erdogan's rule, have been taking place during an economic downturn. The currency, the lira, has been losing value recently and the economy went into recession in the last three months of 2018. Erdogan shows NZ attack video at rallies Why is Turkey fighting the markets? Erdogan: Turkey's pugnacious president The AKP - or Justice and Development Party - alleges ""invalid votes and irregularities in most of the 12,158 polling stations in Ankara"". Its general secretary, Fatih Sahin, said on Twitter: ""We will use our legal rights to the fullest, and we will not allow the will of our citizens to be altered in Ankara."" This video can not be played Erdogan: ""We will appeal wherever needed"" The AKP says it will also challenge the result in Istanbul - the largest city - and the eastern province of Igdir. Commenting on the results in a speech on Sunday, Mr Erdogan looked ahead to national elections in 2023: ""We have a long period ahead where we will carry out economic reforms without compromising on the rules of the free-market economy. ""If there are any shortcomings, it is our duty to correct them,"" he said. More than 57 million people in the country were registered to vote for mayors and councillors. Turnout was high at just under 85%. The opposition Republican People's Party (CHP) candidate Mansur Yavas won in Ankara, officials said. With almost all votes counted, he was on nearly 51% and the AKP's Mehmet Ozhaseki had won the support of just over 47%. Both CHP and the AKP claim victory in Istanbul, which has been in the hands of parties linked to Mr Erdogan since 1994, when he was elected the city's mayor. The election commission said the CHP's Ekrem Imamoglu was leading there by less than 0.5%, but that the results of more than 80 ballot boxes were being challenged. Results carried by Anadolu put the margin even narrower, at less than 0.25%. The CHP's mayoral candidate for Istanbul Ekrem Imamoglu has claimed victory by 28,000 votes The AKP had been saying its candidate, former Prime Minister Binali Yildirim, was ahead by 4,000 votes. He later conceded his opponent had a narrow lead, only for the AKP to again claim victory. The third largest city, Izmir, went to the CHP. ""The people have voted in favour of democracy. They have chosen democracy,"" CHP leader Kemal Kilicdaroglu said. Analysis by Mark Lowen, BBC Turkey correspondent Electoral figures show Istanbul falling to the opposition by a whisker, although the ruling party has challenged the result and refused to concede. Ekrem Imamoglu, who's already changed his Twitter profile to ""mayor of Istanbul"", has vowed to serve all sides - those who voted for and against him - without discrimination. President Erdogan's setbacks deepened elsewhere, losing the capital, Ankara, and several other cities as his conservative voters punished him for an economic crisis. Local elections are important here. Parties build their base at grassroots level; Mr Erdogan himself gained power after being mayor of Istanbul. He turned this poll into, in effect, a referendum on himself. Now his image of invincibility has been broken and an opposition long seen as hopelessly divided has got a new lease of life. Swathes of Turkey still adore Mr Erdogan, but the half of the country that detests its polarising president are starting to believe he's beatable. This was the first municipal vote since Mr Erdogan assumed sweeping executive powers through last year's presidential election. The AKP, with its roots in political Islam, has won every election since coming to power in 2002. Mr Erdogan, whose two-month campaign included 100 rallies, said the poll was about the ""survival"" of the country and his party. AKP supporters also celebrated in Istanbul - but Mr Erdogan later hinted that the party may have lost control there With most media either pro-government or controlled by Mr Erdogan's supporters, critics believe opposition parties campaigned at a disadvantage. Mr Erdogan's rallies dominated TV coverage. The opposition pro-Kurdish Peoples' Democratic Party (HDP) said the elections were unfair and refused to put forward candidates in several cities. Some of its leaders have been jailed on terrorism charges, accusations they reject. Why is Turkey fighting the markets?

"The justice secretary argued Theresa May's deal remained the best outcome It would not be ""sustainable"" to ignore MPs if they vote for a softer Brexit, Justice Secretary David Gauke has said. On Monday, Parliament will hold an indicative vote on Brexit alternatives. A customs union with the EU is thought to be the most likely preference. Meanwhile, the prime minister is considering her next move after her plan was defeated for a third time. European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker said on Sunday that patience was running out with the UK. In an Italian television interview, Mr Juncker said that the EU wanted to see MPs reach an agreement about the terms of the UK's departure in the coming hours and days. Dominic Grieve loses no-confidence vote Brexit: What happens next? What are MPs voting on? Mr Gauke said there are ""no ideal choices"" over the Brexit deadlock. Speaking on the BBC's Andrew Marr Show, he argued the prime minister's deal was ""the best outcome"". But he added: ""Sometimes you do have to accept your second or third choice to avoid an outcome you consider to be even worse."" Labour's deputy leader Tom Watson said it would be ""inconceivable"" if there was a general election and his party did not include a new referendum in its manifesto. Theresa May arrives at church with her husband Philip Following the UK's vote to leave the EU in 2016, Theresa Maynegotiated a withdrawal deal with the EU. Although European leaders agreed to the plan, Mrs May has yet to get the deal approved by Parliament. The prime minister has until 12 April to seek a longer extension to the Article 50 process if the UK is to avoid leaving without a deal. The prime minister's deal is currently opposed by parties including Northern Ireland's DUP - which the government relies upon for support - as well as a group of her own MPs. Tory Brexiteer Steve Baker, who resigned as a Brexit minister over the PM's handling of negotiations,wrote in the Sunday Telegraph,externalthat Mrs May's deal ""cannot be allowed to go through at any cost"". However he admitted deciding to vote for it on Thursday before being talked out of it by friends. Monday, 1 April:MPs hold another set of votes on Brexit options to see if they can agree on a way forward Wednesday, 3 April:Potentially another round of so-called ""indicative votes"" Wednesday, 10 April: Emergency summit of EU leaders to consider any UK request for further extension Friday, 12 April:Brexit day, if UK does not seek/EU does not grant further delay 23-26 May:European Parliamentary elections On Monday, MPs have a non-binding vote on a series of options designed to test the will of Parliament. The intention is to see what outcome, if any, commands a majority. None of MPs' eight proposed options secured a majority in the first set of indicative votes on 27 March, but those which received the most were a customs union with the EU and a referendum on any deal. A customs union would allow businesses to move goods around the EU without tariffs, ie taxes - but membership would bar the UK from striking independent trade deals after Brexit. Why is the customs union so important? What is the 'no deal' WTO option? How can Article 50 be extended? Would no deal mean the return of direct rule in NI? Mr Gauke said he was in favour of leaving the customs union, arguing that it would ""better reflect the way the country voted in 2016"". Membership of a customs union would breach the Conservative's 2017 manifesto. But he acknowledged that his party ""does not have the votes to get its manifesto position through the House of Commons at the moment"". ""We are in an environment where it is not just about going for your first choice,"" he added. Defence Minister Tobias Ellwood told Radio 4's The World This Weekend he would support something along the lines of customs union membership - if the prime minister's deal could not get through Parliament. ""I fear that is the only option we have if we want to honour the referendum"" he said. Brexit demonstrators gather outside the Houses of Parliament Mr Gauke reiterated his opposition to a no-deal Brexit, warning he would leave government if such a policy was pursued. A no-deal Brexit would mean cutting ties with the European Union immediately and defaulting to World Trade Organisation rules for trade. Tom Watson said there was an ""emerging consensus"" among Labour MPs. He said: ""Whatever the deal looks like - and we understand there has to be compromises - if it's underpinned by a People's Vote that is the way we can bring the country back together."" Please upgrade your browser Use the list below or select a button Speaking on Sky News, shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry said under a Labour government it was ""likely"" that the UK would leave the European Union. When asked if Labour was a Remain party, Ms Thornberry replied: ""In our hearts we want to remain but we have to square that with democracy. ""If the people want us to leave we have to leave."" Ms Thornberry also said ""it looks like the time may come"" for another attempted no confidence vote in the government. If passed, this would pave the way for a general election. The deputy chairman of the Conservative Party, James Cleverly, told Sky News that his party is doing ""sensible pragmatic planning"" in case there is a snap general election, but not seeking to call one. And Mr Gauke warned he did not see how a general election would solve the current deadlock. Former Conservative prime minister John Major said: ""When feelings are running high... a general election is pretty much the very last thing we need."" But he added: ""We might be driven to it later."" John Major signed the Maastricht Treaty, which furthered European integration If an election failed to produce a majority in the Commons, Sir John suggested a ""time limited"" national unity government should be formed. He said: ""I think it would be in the national interest to have a cross-party government so we can take decisions without the chaos that we're seeing in Parliament at the moment where every possible alternative is rejected."" ""I don't think it is ideal, I would prefer a Conservative government with a clear majority."" But he argued such a government would at least enable decisions to be taken. What did MPs vote on?

The victims appeared to have been selected randomly, police said. Two are in a critical condition. Two men have been arrested on suspicion of causing grievous bodily harm. The first suspect was detained just before 11:00 BST in Fore Street, Edmonton, with police saying that inquiries were continuing to establish if he is the person behind the stabbings. The second man, aged in his 40s, was arrested later on Sunday at a residential address in Edmonton. Both men remain in police custody. The Metropolitan Police said the motive ""appears to be solely to inflict harm"" as none of the victims were robbed and had not engaged in conversation before being attacked. A spokesman said the knifeman had acted alone and ""mental health issues may be a factor"". He added: ""We are doing everything we can to apprehend the suspect behind these cowardly and senseless attacks."" The first attack was on a 45-year-old woman who was hurt in Aberdeen Road at 19:02 GMT on Saturday. She remains in a critical condition in an east London hospital. Four hours later, a 52-year-old man was stabbed half a mile away in Park Avenue. His injuries are not life-threatening. Police believe the third attack happened less than a mile away in Silver Street. The victim, a 23-year-old man, was found injured at Seven Sisters Tube station at about 04:00 BST. He is in a critical condition in hospital. The final stabbing happened at 09:42 in Brettenham Road, less than a mile away from Silver Street. Police said a 29-year-old man has been taken to hospital after being stabbed in the back. He has potentially life-changing injuries. Officers accompanied by a police dog have been making inquiries with residents on Aberdeen Road Dervish Husseyin, 60, was at his friend's house on Aberdeen Road when he saw the woman ""lying face down"". ""She said they had beaten her up,"" he said. Mr Husseyin said the woman had ""blood on her back"" but did not seem to realise she had been stabbed. ""She said she only went out for a walk on her own,"" he added. Natasha Cameron, 45, who lives on Aberdeen Road, said: ""I'm scared now because I always walk home [from work]. ""Now I'm definitely taking the bus."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"Mr Bezos' text messages to his lover were published by the National Enquirer An investigator for Amazon boss Jeff Bezos says that Saudi Arabia hacked Mr Bezos's phone and accessed his data. Gavin de Becker was hired by Mr Bezos to find out how his private messages had been leaked to the National Enquirer tabloid. Mr de Becker linked the hack to the Washington Post's coverage of the murder of Saudi writer Jamal Khashoggi at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul. Saudi Arabia has not yet commented on the allegation. Mr Bezos owns the Washington Post. Mr de Becker said he had handed his findings over to US federal officials. ""Our investigators and several experts concluded with high confidence thatthe Saudis had access to Bezos' phone,external, and gained private information,"" he wrote on the Daily Beast website. Tabloid's owner defends Jeff Bezos report The Jamal Khashoggi story so far What is the National Enquirer? Mr de Becker's findings come after Mr Bezos in February accused the National Enquirer's parent company American Media Inc (AMI) of blackmail, saying it had threatened to publish his intimate photos unless he said that the tabloid's reporting was not politically motivated. The National Enquirer had published claims in January that the Amazon boss had been having an affair. The coverage included photos and text messages. Mr de Becker said that AMI had also demanded that he say his investigation had concluded that AMI had not relied upon ""any form of electronic eavesdropping or hacking in their newsgathering process"". He alleged that the Saudi government had targeted the Washington Post - for which Mr Khashoggi had been writing. ""Some Americans will be surprised to learn that the Saudi government has been very intent on harming Jeff Bezos since last October, when the Post began its relentless coverage of Khashoggi's murder,"" Mr de Becker said. ""It's clear that MBS considers the Washington Post to be a major enemy,"" he added, referring to Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. US officials have said that Mr Khashoggi's murder would have needed Prince Mohammed's approval, but Saudi Arabia has denied that he was involved. The Saudi embassy in Washington has not responded to a request for comment on Mr de Becker's allegation, Reuters reported. In February, the Saudi minister of state for foreign affairs said Saudi Arabia had ""absolutely nothing to do"" with the National Enquirer's reporting on Mr Bezos' affair. AMI has not yet commented on Mr de Becker's allegations. The company has previously said that it acted lawfully in its reporting of Mr Bezos' personal life.
