"More than 20 million people in the UK have now had their first dose of a coronavirus vaccine. Prime Minister Boris Johnson called it a ""huge national achievement"" and said ""every jab makes a difference in our battle against Covid"". The latest government figures show 20,089,551 people in the UK have now had a first dose, while 796,132 have had a second. The government is aiming to offer all adults a first jab by the end of July. But the head of NHS Providers - which represents hospital trusts in England - warned there was ""a long way to go"". ""We're not even close to half way through this programme,"" said Chris Hopson. ""And there's a further challenge: to design a workforce model to enable us to do this year in year out."" While he welcomed the milestone, he added: ""As we set out in our recent briefing, we need to see more progress on vaccines, lower Covid-19 case numbers, much less pressure on the NHS and plans in place to contain future outbreaks before easing restrictions. ""Now is not the time to let down our guard."" When will it be my turn to be vaccinated? Brazil 'variant of concern' found in UK The government's next target is to offer a first dose to all over-50s by 15 April, as well as people aged 16-64 with certain underlying health conditions and unpaid carers for disabled and elderly people. After that, people will be prioritised by age group. There are no plans yet to vaccinate children, although trialshave been announced to test the Oxford-AstraZeneca jab on children. From Monday, nearly two million people aged 60 to 63 in England will start receiving letters inviting them to book their vaccine. Mr Johnson said on Twitter that the 20 million milestone was ""a testament to the tireless work of NHS staff, volunteers, the armed forces and many more"". ""I urge everyone to get the jab when called,"" he added. Health Secretary Matt Hancockalso said,externalit was ""a magnificent achievement for the country"" and the vaccine was ""our route out"". According tothe figures published on Sunday,,externalthe 20 million milestone was reached after a further 407,503 jabs were administered in one day. The figures include: 17.1 million first doses given in England, 1.6 million first doses in Scotland, 923,615 first doses in Wales and 520,996 first doses in Northern Ireland. Meanwhile, NHS England said people in the 60-63 age bracket would start receiving letters on Monday explaining how to book a jab through the national booking service, with those aged 50 to 60 set to be invited ""shortly"". It said the vaccine rollout was gaining ""fresh momentum"", with medical director Prof Stephen Powis urging anyone who had been invited to take up the offer. ""It doesn't matter when you were invited you can still come forward and protect yourself and others,"" he said. NHS England chief executive Sir Simon Stevens said vaccine supplies are expected to increase in March, adding: ""We're planning for further acceleration as we head towards Easter.""

"Elin Jones, Hannah Blythyn and Suzy Davies have worked to help boost female participation in politics. A lack of female candidates in winnable seats for the Welsh Parliament is a ""worrying step backwards"" for equality, a charity has warned. Wales became the first country in the world in 2003 to have an equal number of men and women in parliament. However, polls suggest just 34% of female candidates for May's Senedd election are in ""winnable"" seats. Gender equality charity Chwarae Teg said the next Welsh Parliament was likely to be less diverse. After the 2016 election, 42% of the Welsh Parliament, as it is now known, were women. But that has risen to more than 48% after Delyth Jewell, Mandy Jones, Laura Anne-Jones, and Helen Mary-Jones were sworn in - with the current Senedd gender split 29 women to 31 men. Feminist government: How well is Wales doing? Wales councillor 'screamed at because of age' 'Impossible' to be a politician and raise a family Ahead of May's upcoming Senedd elections, 50% of Labour candidates are women, compared to 41% for Plaid Cymru, 34% for Conservatives and 29% for Liberal Democrats. However, according to projections made by political consultancy Deryn, based on recent polling data and a 10% margin, the number of women in winnable seats is much lower. This video can not be played Hannah Blythyn says she is proud to be one of the first openly gay assembly members Polling suggests that of the 29 women standing for Labour, 16 are in seats classed as winnable. Meanwhile, nine of the 19 female Plaid candidates, and three of the 16 women standing for the Conservatives are in seats considered as winnable. Polling suggests the Liberal Democrats have no women in seats thought to be winnable - of the 11 standing. A number of key female figures in Welsh politics are due to stand down at May's election, including the only currentWelsh Liberal Democrat MS Kirsty Williams, the education secretary. Chwarae Teg chief executive Cerys Furlong said some of the parties had become complacent, while others had taken no action to improve representation. ""It is incredibly disappointing that the next Senedd is likely to be taking a very serious and worrying step backwards,"" she said. Former MS Nerys Evans, now director at Deryn, said having an equal parliament helped to change the kind of policies and laws passed. ""Because of that increased representation we have seen ground breaking legislation and policy being passed in terms of caring, mental health and domestic abuse,"" she said. ""These things just wouldn't have had the priority and the dominance without women's voices in the Senedd and in the Welsh Government making the case."" Suzy Davies, member of the Senedd since 2011, has lost her easiest way of being re-elected to the Welsh Parliament Conservative MS Suzy Davies said she was disappointed new women coming into politics were not being given as much of a chance as men. Ms Davies, who ran against Paul Davies to lead the Tories in Cardiff Bay in 2018, faces losing her seat afteryoung male candidates were chosen to top the party's names on the regional list. ""It's very hard when you have a very localised system to ask a local association to make a strategic decision for a party,"" she said. ""I do recognise that, but that's something that the hierarchy of the party can do to help local associations understand better."" Ms Davies, who is the director of Women 2 Win, a campaign to encourage more women to stand for the Welsh Conservatives, said she was disappointed so few women were in winnable seats. ""I would have loved to have seen that and I look again to our processes to ask why that's been so difficult when actually we have new men coming through and they're getting more viable seats,"" she said. This video can not be played Bethan Sayed said the 24/7 culture of her job made it ""impossible"" to raise her new family Plaid Cymru's Bethan Sayed,who is due to step down at the May elections to spend more time with her family, said more needed to be done to support women entering politics. She said: ""We live in an unequal society. If women weren't in so many caring roles, if women weren't on so many zero hours contracts, if they weren't suffering maternity discrimination I would say, yes, let's have meritocracy. ""Until we get to a system where we all equal, we will need things like quotas and we will need measures like jobshares.""

"A coronavirus ""variant of concern"" first detected in Brazil has now been found in the UK. Three cases have been detected in England and separately three in Scotland. In England, officials are still trying to track down one of those who tested positive for the new variant. The three Scottish residents had flown to north-east Scotland from Brazil via Paris and London, the Scottish government said. Experts believe this variant (P1) - first detected in travellers to Japan from Manaus in northern Brazil in January - could be more contagious. There are also concerns vaccines may not be as effective against it - but NHS England's Prof Stephen Powis said vaccines could be ""rapidly adapted"". Dr Susan Hopkins, from Public Health England (PHE), said the UK was more advanced than many other countries in identifying the variants and mutations and therefore able to act quickly. How worrying is the Brazil coronavirus variant? More than 20m in UK have had first Covid jab In England, the first two cases are from the same household in South Gloucestershire after someone returned from Brazil on 10 February - five days before the government's hotel quarantine rule came into force. Two other people in the same household have also since tested positive for Covid - but tests are still ongoing to check if it is the same variant, so they are not included in the overall UK total of six. PHE said officials are now tracking down passengers who were on the same flight from Sao Paulo to Heathrow, via Zurich. The third case identified in England is not linked to the other two cases and the whereabouts of that person are still not known. PHE said the person did not complete their test registration card so follow-up details are unavailable. Officials are asking anyone who took a test on 12 or 13 February and who has not received a result or has an uncompleted test registration card to come forward immediately by calling 119. Meanwhile, testing is being ramped up in South Gloucestershire - on the outskirts of Bristol - with people living in five postcode areas invited to get tested even if they do not have symptoms. Thepostcodes fall within Bradley Stoke, Patchway and Little Stoke. Regarding the cases in Scotland, the government said the three people had tested positive while self-isolating. Other passengers who were on the same flight from London to Aberdeen are now being contacted. The Brazil variant is something officials are worried about because it shares similar mutations to the South Africa variant of concern. Both have undergone genetic changes that could make them more contagious and perhaps less easy to stop with our current vaccines. The coronavirus jabs being given to people now were designed around earlier versions of the pandemic virus, not these new variants. Scientists believe they should still protect, although perhaps not quite as well. Work is already under way to redesign or tweak the vaccines to make them a better match for some of these new ""variants of concern"". These updated vaccines could be ready within months, meaning the UK would have millions of doses ready to give people a booster shot before next winter to make sure the population is protected. There will be more cases out there of new variants that have not yet been identified. While it may not be possible to eliminate them, the determination is there to slow the spread of coronavirus, including new variants. Sticking to the social distancing rules will help. Both PHE and the Scottish government said the variant had been designated ""of concern"" as it shares some important mutations with the variant first identified in South Africa (known as B.1.351). One of these mutations - called E484K - may help the virus evade parts of the immune system called antibodies. It is also possible that this variant may respond less well to current vaccines, but more work is needed to understand this. In January, a coronavirus variant from Brazilwas found in the UK- but it was not this variant of concern. PHE said the ""risk to the wider community is considered low"" but as a precaution extra community testing is be rolled out in some postcodes north of Bristol. It urged people to keep following the coronavirus measures. Extra testing in the community has already been carried out for other variants elsewhere in the country Meanwhile, Labour's shadow home secretary, Nick Thomas-Symonds, said the news of the variant was ""deeply concerning"". ""It is now vital that we do everything we can to contain it,"" he said. ""But this is further proof that the delay in introducing a hotel quarantine was reckless and the continuing refusal to put in place a comprehensive system leaves us exposed to mutations coming from overseas."" The hotel quarantine rule came into forceon 15 February. It means that travellers coming to England from 33 countries - including Brazil - must pay to quarantine in a hotel for 10 days, while in Scotland the rule applies to travellers from all countries. Before that date, travellers arriving in the UK still needed to self-isolate in their homes for 10 days. All travellers to the UK also need to present a negative Covid test taken a maximum of 72 hours before their departure. Home Affairs Committee chairwoman Yvette Coopersaid on Twitter,externalit was ""notable"" that the pre-flight testsfirst brought in by the government in Januarydid not catch six cases. It comes as the UK announced another 6,035 cases of coronavirus and reported that a further 144 people had died within 28 days of a positive test. But a milestone in the vaccination programme was reached, withmore than 20 million people having receivedtheir first dose of the vaccine. LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area?

"Chancellor Rishi Sunak's Budget will be one of the most-closely watched in years, as the government grapples with the enormous economic costs of the Covid-19 pandemic, and as he charts a financial roadmap for the country. In his 3 March statement, the chancellor will outline the state of the UK economy and its outlook for the future - and give details of the government's plans for raising or lowering taxes. So how is the UK economy faring under the twin impacts of coronavirus and Brexit? In the following charts, we take a snapshot of the nation's economic health - highlighting some of the economic challenges facing the chancellor. The UK's national debt has reached its highest level since 1963 - reflecting the huge cost of pandemic support measures such as the furlough scheme. National debt here means the total amount the government owes to its lenders - it is the accumulation of borrowing over many years. So far this year, the annual total for government borrowing - the amount the government borrows to make up for the gap between what it spends and what it raises in taxes - has reached Â£270.6bn, which is Â£222bn more than a year ago, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). The independent Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) estimates that this figure could reach Â£393.5bn by the end of the financial year in March. This would be the highest amount in any year since the Second World War. But it is also worth pointing out that this figure has been above 100% of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) or annual national income in 131 of the last 320 years. The 21st Century so far has been one of rising levels of public sector net borrowing (how much both central and local government have borrowed to carry out their spending programmes). Last month's figure was Â£8.8bn, the highest January borrowing amount since monthly records began in 1993. As a result of the pandemic, public sector net debt has risen by Â£316.4bn over the 10 months since last April to an all-time high of Â£2.1 trillion. Unemployment is currently 5.1%, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). This is the highest figure for five years, and shows the effects of lockdowns on the economy due to the pandemic, with many workplaces forced to close their doors. So far, this hasn't resulted in a rapid rise in unemployment, as the furlough support scheme has helped to protect jobs, but this could change if the scheme ends as planned in April. Most economists expect the unemployment rate to continue rising in 2021. However, the roll-out of Covid vaccines is happening quickly and this may help to keep unemployment down if it allows a staged re-start of the UK economy. Young people have been hit particularly hard by the labour market fallout from coronavirus, with workers aged under 24 accounting for nearly half of the total fall in employment during the economic slump, according to research by the Institute for Employment Studies (IES). At the same time, more people are chasing fewer jobs, so young people are struggling to enter the employment market. Significantly, young people account for 46% of the overall fall in employment during the pandemic - even though they only account for just one in nine of the workforce. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has hinted that furlough support for workers will continue beyond April, as he pledged not to ""pull the rug out"" from under the UK economy when he unveiled plans to ease the national lockdown in four steps. If the government does not extend the job support schemes, then the latest forecast from the Bank of England suggests that UK unemployment will reach 7.75% during the summer. Full-time work has risen during the pandemic, despite the impact of Covid on the labour market. However, the numbers of those in part-time jobs or self-employed have dropped, as freelancers and those in precarious work bear the brunt of the crisis. Campaign groups are calling on the chancellor to plug gaps in schemes such as the self-employed income support scheme (SEISS) to support millions of self-employed people and other workers excluded from furlough. The Resolution Foundation think tank says that 2.3 million workers are missing out on help because they are not covered by SEISS. UK house prices climbed 8.5% last year - that's the highest annual growth rate since October 2014 - with the average UK house price reaching a record high of Â£252,000 in December 2020. The North West had the highest growth of 11.2%, while London rose just 3.5%. One of the factors behind the rise has been the stamp duty holiday in England that was introduced last July. However, if the tax break ends on 31 March as planned, sales and house price rises are likely to slow afterwards. What is the Budget and when will it happen?

"On Budget day the chancellor usually holds up a traditional red box full of financial documents On Wednesday, Chancellor Rishi Sunak will unveil his Budget. He'll say how much of our money the government will take in taxes, and what they will spend it on. Each year, the chancellor of the exchequer - who is in charge of the government's finances - makes a Budget statement to MPs in the House of Commons. It outlines the government's plans for raising or lowering taxes. It also includes big decisions on what the government will spend money on - including health, schools, police and other public services. The Budget speech will be delivered onWednesday 27 October. It usually starts at about 12:30 UK time and lasts about an hour. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer will give his response straight afterwards. This year's Autumn Budget is unusual for two reasons: It's the second of the year - there was a Budget in March too It comes on the same day asthe results of a spending review,external, which details how government will fund public services for the next three years After the speech, the independent Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) - which monitors government spending - will publish a report on how the economy is doing. The Budget is likely to include help to support businesses and individuals recover from the economic effects of Covid. A number of measures have been announced in advance of the Budget, including a rise inthe minimum wage from Â£8.91 per hour to Â£9.50and anend to the public sector pay freeze. The chancellor will likely set out some more details of the government's long term ambitions: Reducing the UK's net greenhouse emissions to zero by 2050 to combat climate change Levelling up - bringing jobs and investment to the poorer regions of the UK. Budget 2021: What has already been announced? Though many businesses are open again, the impact of the pandemic on government finances will last for years Measures such as thefurlough scheme- which finished at the end of September - were expensive, and government income is down because it collected less money in tax during the pandemic. To close the gap between higher spending and less money, the government has had to borrow more. In the year ending April 2021, the government borrowed Â£320bn - the highest figure seen outside wartime. Economists expect it to borrow around Â£180bn more this year, another enormous sum. During his Budget speech, the Chancellor will set out the latest borrowing forecasts for the years ahead. Where does the government borrow billions from? The government needs to cut the gap between what it spends and what it raises. One major tax rise was announced in September - the Â£12bnHealth and Social Care Levy. This broke a promise the Conservatives made at the last election, not to raise the three biggest taxes - income tax, national insurance and VAT. There has been speculation that graduates may be asked to start paying back student loans earlier. At the same time,the cost of living is rising. So the chancellor may want to cut some taxes, such as the amount of VAT pay on energy bills. He is also expected to announce major changes to the complicated alcohol tax system, which could see sparkling wine become cheaper. Six things that could affect you in the Budget Why is the cost of living going up? Overall government spending will rise next year, with big increases already announced for health and schools in England. The government has already said thatthe NHS in England will receive an extra Â£5.9bnto help clear the record backlog of people waiting for tests and scans. But other government departments, such as courts, prisons, local government and transport,are braced for cuts to their day-to-day budgetsnext year. They have already faced a decade of tight spending, and making further cuts will be painful. Could alcohol duty be reformed in the Budget? Some parts of the Budget, such as defence spending, affect the whole of the UK. Others, such as education, only affect England. This is because Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland make their own decisions. Scotland has income tax-raising powers, which means its rates differ from the rest of the UK. The Scottish government will publish its Budget on 9 December. If the government announces extra spending on areas that only affect England, the other nations get an equivalent extra sum of money to spend as they choose, according to a rulecalled the Barnett formula.

"It's going to be an historic Budget because of the numbers. But between the fiscal fireworks and the extension of rescue packages, Chancellor Rishi Sunak was always going to have to point the country towards a changed economy. Post-pandemic, post-Brexit and ahead of significant ""net zero"" decarbonisation challenges, the plumbing of the economy is about to change. The vaccine progress will obviously impact the timing, and perhaps the speed, of recovery from crisis. But I'm also told that the chancellor will make the argument at the Budget that the successful rollout of the Oxford-AstraZeneca coronavirus vaccine in the UK represents a model for transforming these profound medium-term changes in the economy into sustained recovery. It might be called the ""OxAz model"" of high science, big business, public participation, significant state funding and rapid regulation. Appearing alongside the head of the Oxford vaccine team at one of his pre-Budget events, the chancellor said: ""Our regulatory system has proved to be more agile and nimble and much better joined-up, than others, perhaps around the world."" 'Furlough is a lifeline, I hope they extend it' What is the Budget and when will it happen? He described the public-private partnership between government and AstraZeneca as a ""success"". Prof Sarah Gilbert, who designed the Oxford vaccine, suggested that the past year had disproved misconceptions that vaccine research was the preserve of Big Pharma: ""There's an awful lot of research that goes on in universities and in small companies. ""And we've seen some really creative partnerships really helping to move things forward."" It's well known that the government poured money into various vaccine research programmes, funding them through early stage trials and even enabling the charter of private jets to help trials, at one point. An NHS pharmacist preparing doses of the AstraZeneca Covid vaccine in Wadebridge A potential deal between Oxford University and a US drug-maker was blocked in favour of the UK's AstraZeneca, until then not a big player in vaccines. Trials took advantage of the integrated network of controlled testing available across NHS hospitals. Regulators pushed the system to allow for the same intensity of scientific trials - but in an extremely compressed timeframe. We have seen the end product of publicly-funded science, state-brokered commercialisation, big business partnership, and the logistical efforts of the NHS and volunteers working together. Are there lessons for electric car batteries, financial technology, or even new forms of food? The argument has already been deployed in favour of the new Advanced Research and Innovation Agency, modelled on the US defence agency Darpa, which had a role well before the pandemic in funding the first mRNA vaccines that paved the way for the Pfizer vaccine. In announcing that, the government said it would have a ""much higher tolerance for failure than normal"", because the ""freedom to fail is often also the freedom to succeed"". Alok Sharma's Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) justified Â£11.7bn spending on vaccines Indeed such thinking may have been present throughout the last year's rolling responses to the pandemic crisis from sourcing ventilators, and protective equipment to the test and trace system and testing technologies. The success in vaccines was pre-dated by a more mixed picture in other parts of the pandemic response. Will the government be throwing equivalent sums of money at other forms of economic innovation, as it did for vaccines? It was a risk given that no human coronavirus vaccine had ever been approved, let alone within one year. But as the National Audit Office has reported, the initial Â£11.7bn spent upfront on vaccines was justified using a cost-benefit analysis by Alok Sharma's Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS). BEIS said the money spent would bring estimated potential benefits of between ""Â£11bn and Â£231bn, excluding wider health and social benefits"". The vaccine stands on its own on that score. But as well as saving lives and helping reopen the economy, the shot in the arm could have a far longer-lasting economic effect.

"A coronavirus ""variant of concern"" first detected in Brazil has now been found in the UK. Three cases have been detected in England and separately three in Scotland. In England, officials are still trying to track down one of those who tested positive for the new variant. The three Scottish residents had flown to north-east Scotland from Brazil via Paris and London, the Scottish government said. Experts believe this variant (P1) - first detected in travellers to Japan from Manaus in northern Brazil in January - could be more contagious. There are also concerns vaccines may not be as effective against it - but NHS England's Prof Stephen Powis said vaccines could be ""rapidly adapted"". Dr Susan Hopkins, from Public Health England (PHE), said the UK was more advanced than many other countries in identifying the variants and mutations and therefore able to act quickly. How worrying is the Brazil coronavirus variant? More than 20m in UK have had first Covid jab In England, the first two cases are from the same household in South Gloucestershire after someone returned from Brazil on 10 February - five days before the government's hotel quarantine rule came into force. Two other people in the same household have also since tested positive for Covid - but tests are still ongoing to check if it is the same variant, so they are not included in the overall UK total of six. PHE said officials are now tracking down passengers who were on the same flight from Sao Paulo to Heathrow, via Zurich. The third case identified in England is not linked to the other two cases and the whereabouts of that person are still not known. PHE said the person did not complete their test registration card so follow-up details are unavailable. Officials are asking anyone who took a test on 12 or 13 February and who has not received a result or has an uncompleted test registration card to come forward immediately by calling 119. Meanwhile, testing is being ramped up in South Gloucestershire - on the outskirts of Bristol - with people living in five postcode areas invited to get tested even if they do not have symptoms. Thepostcodes fall within Bradley Stoke, Patchway and Little Stoke. Regarding the cases in Scotland, the government said the three people had tested positive while self-isolating. Other passengers who were on the same flight from London to Aberdeen are now being contacted. The Brazil variant is something officials are worried about because it shares similar mutations to the South Africa variant of concern. Both have undergone genetic changes that could make them more contagious and perhaps less easy to stop with our current vaccines. The coronavirus jabs being given to people now were designed around earlier versions of the pandemic virus, not these new variants. Scientists believe they should still protect, although perhaps not quite as well. Work is already under way to redesign or tweak the vaccines to make them a better match for some of these new ""variants of concern"". These updated vaccines could be ready within months, meaning the UK would have millions of doses ready to give people a booster shot before next winter to make sure the population is protected. There will be more cases out there of new variants that have not yet been identified. While it may not be possible to eliminate them, the determination is there to slow the spread of coronavirus, including new variants. Sticking to the social distancing rules will help. Both PHE and the Scottish government said the variant had been designated ""of concern"" as it shares some important mutations with the variant first identified in South Africa (known as B.1.351). One of these mutations - called E484K - may help the virus evade parts of the immune system called antibodies. It is also possible that this variant may respond less well to current vaccines, but more work is needed to understand this. In January, a coronavirus variant from Brazilwas found in the UK- but it was not this variant of concern. PHE said the ""risk to the wider community is considered low"" but as a precaution extra community testing is be rolled out in some postcodes north of Bristol. It urged people to keep following the coronavirus measures. Extra testing in the community has already been carried out for other variants elsewhere in the country Meanwhile, Labour's shadow home secretary, Nick Thomas-Symonds, said the news of the variant was ""deeply concerning"". ""It is now vital that we do everything we can to contain it,"" he said. ""But this is further proof that the delay in introducing a hotel quarantine was reckless and the continuing refusal to put in place a comprehensive system leaves us exposed to mutations coming from overseas."" The hotel quarantine rule came into forceon 15 February. It means that travellers coming to England from 33 countries - including Brazil - must pay to quarantine in a hotel for 10 days, while in Scotland the rule applies to travellers from all countries. Before that date, travellers arriving in the UK still needed to self-isolate in their homes for 10 days. All travellers to the UK also need to present a negative Covid test taken a maximum of 72 hours before their departure. Home Affairs Committee chairwoman Yvette Coopersaid on Twitter,externalit was ""notable"" that the pre-flight testsfirst brought in by the government in Januarydid not catch six cases. It comes as the UK announced another 6,035 cases of coronavirus and reported that a further 144 people had died within 28 days of a positive test. But a milestone in the vaccination programme was reached, withmore than 20 million people having receivedtheir first dose of the vaccine. LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area?

We will back with more coronavirus news updates tomorrow. Our live page team today has been: James Clarke, Victoria Lindrea, Hamish Mackay and Lauren Turner. We will be bringing our live page coverage to a close soon. Before we do, here is a recap of some of the top stories we've been covering today:  Alex Pope Face-to-face counselling services can continue, subject to government guidelines More counsellors are needed due tothe rising number of young people with mental health problems in lockdown, a charity is warning. Michele Flynn, operations manager atBedford Open Door,external- a service for 13 to 25-year-olds - says it has seen a rise in the number of youngsters who have been self-harming or have suicidal thoughts. ""With schools and colleges being closed they're not getting the normal interaction from their friends and support from school staff and teachers,"" she says. ""Demand has significantly increased already and we know this is going to continue to rise."" The charity is asking qualified counsellors willing to donate two hours a week to get in touch. ""The pandemic has compounded the challenge and issues young people face. ""It could be any child from any background that could be affected and that's what we're here for,"" Flynn adds. Six cases of the Brazil variant of Covid-19 have been detected in the UK- three in Scotland and three in England. Two cases of the Manaus strain in England are from one household in South Gloucestershire with a history of travel to Brazil but the third case in England is not linked - but it is not known where that individual is. Dr Susan Hopkins, Public Health England's strategic response director for Covid-19, said: ""We have identified these cases thanks to the UK's advanced sequencing capabilities."" And following a return to north-east Scotland from Brazil, three Scottish residents tested positive for the new strain of coronavirus. They have been in self-isolation since their return. They are not thought to be connected to the cases in England. The tests were completed in early February and passed to the UK's advanced sequencing capabilities programme - which detected this new variant. The three people flew into London and then on to Aberdeen. Other people who were on the flight to Aberdeen are being contacted because of the concerns around the Brazil variant. Scotland's Health Secretary Jeane Freeman says: ""The identification of this new variant is a concern but we are taking every possible precaution. ""We have identified these cases thanks to our use of advanced sequencing capabilities which means we are finding more variants and mutations than many other countries and are therefore able to take action quickly."" The World Health Organization has been informed of the cases You can read more about Covid variants here. NHS Providers chief executive Chris Hopkins is praising the rollout of 20 million first doses of Covid-19 vaccines in the UK as a ""great credit to everyone involved"". But he warns ""now is not the time to let down our guard"" or ease restrictions, despite the success of the vaccination programme so far. Mr Hopkins says: ""We owe much of this success to trusts, working with colleagues in primary care with the fantastic support of so many volunteers. ""But it's important to remember there's a long way to go - we're not even close to halfway through this programme. ""And there's a further challenge, to design a workforce model to enable us to do this year in year out."" As we've been telling you,more than 20 milion people in the UK have now received a coronavirus vaccine- but many others will be wondering when it will be their turn. The next stage of the Covid-19 vaccine rollout in the UK was outlined by government scientists this week. It was announced that once the top nine priority groups had all been offered a first dose, it would be given to people by age group, rather than by profession. The Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) says the next people to be offered the jab, from around mid-April, will be, in descending order:  It also urged some groups who are at higher risk of needing hospital treatment from Covid to take up the offer of vaccination promptly:  Read more on vaccines here. As pharmaceutical giants ramp-up production in the race to vaccinate the world, one firm has shot into the lead. The Serum Institute of India (SII) isn't a household name, but it's the world's largest vaccine maker. The privately-owned firm churns out 1.5 billion doses every year from the company's vast manufacturing plant in Pune, western India. It is currently making Covid vaccines under license for pharmaceutical firms such as AstraZeneca. SII's chief executive Adar Poonawalla told the BBC the company took a ""huge calculated risk"" by betting on several vaccines in 2020. ""It wasn't a blind risk, because we knew the Oxford scientists from our earlier collaboration with the malaria vaccine,"" he said. But funding proved a challenge. The firm invested around $260m (Â£186.7m) and raised the rest from philanthropists, such as Bill Gates, and advances from other countries. SII managed to secure $800m by May 2020 to make multiple Covid vaccines. Read more here. We know the UK's coronavirus figures are often lower on a Sunday and Monday, because of a lag in reporting at weekends. But we can compare them to the figures last Sunday, when there were 9,834 new cases and 215 deaths. It means the number of deaths is 33% lower today than a week ago and the number of new cases 38.6% lower. Looking at today's figures, it is the lowest number of deaths since 13 December, which was also a Sunday, when there were also 144 new deaths recorded. And it is the lowest number of daily cases since 28 September - on that day, a Monday, there were 4,044 new cases. A further 6,035 new positive coronavirus tests have been recorded in the UK, making the total since the pandemic began 4,176,554. There have been 144 further deaths of people who had tested positive within the previous 28 days. The total number of deaths in the UK stands at 122,849, under that measure. We learned earlier that more than 20 million first doses of the vaccine have now been administered. The total is now 20,089,551 first doses, with 796,132 second doses having been given. Katie Prescott, Business correspondent Businesses are watching the Budget closely for information about the future of key support schemes, especially furlough â the job retention scheme - which is due to end in April. Since it started in March 2020, it has been key to preventing spiking unemployment but no-one expected the government to still be paying workersâ wages a year on. Let alone 4.7 million of them. With so many dependent on it, and having pledged ""support for people"", itâs difficult to see how Chancellor Rishi Sunak can end furlough while some businesses are still closed. But the scheme is not cheap. And with the countryâs debt topping Â£2tn, the same value as the UK economy, the chancellor could start to spell out plans on how he plans to pay at least some of the bill. The UKâs low corporation tax looks a likely contender for rises - although businesses that have struggled through the pandemic argue this is hitting them while theyâre down. NHS England chief executive Sir Simon Stevens has reacted to the news 20 million people in the UK have now received their first vaccine dose. He says giving this many vaccines - including to 17 million people in England alone - since December ""shows the NHS vaccination campaign is firing on all cylinders, and looking out to Easter and beyond, it's full speed ahead"". Sir Simon adds: ""As we can see from other parts of the world, having vaccines from the manufacturers versus actually administering them to patients can be two different things. ""So this latest milestone is also a tribute to careful health service planning, effective organisation and amazing teamwork across the whole of the country."" Lockdown guidelines say people ""should avoid travelling outside of your village, town or the part of a city where you live"". A police force is urging people not to become complacent after ""hundreds"" turned up at a Norfolk village beach. About 30 vehicles were parked near Sea Palling beach yesterday. Officers on patrol found people who had travelled from as far as Peterborough, 100 miles (160km) away, and Ipswich ""to walk on the beach,"" Norfolk Police said. Thecurrent lockdown guidance,externalsays people in England can exercise outdoors once per day in their area. Police urged people to ""stay as local as possible"" during the vaccine rollout and said eight fixed penalty notices were issued. Norfolk Police says it continues to ""engage, encourage and explain to people first"" before resorting to fines. Boris Johnson tweets a graphic of a ""vaccinometer"" as he celebrates the ""huge national achievement"" of more than 20 million people across the UK receiving their first dose of Covid-19 vaccine. The prime minister says the rollout success is ""a testament to the tireless work of NHS staff, volunteers, the armed forces & many more"". Echoing Health Secretary Matt Hancock, he adds: ""I urge everyone to get the jab when called. Every jab makes a difference in our battle against Covid."" Allow Twitter content?

Covid-19safety measures implemented in Northern Ireland schools to date have ""not been adequate"", according to the chair of the education committee. Children in primary 1 to primary 3 (aged four to seven), as well as those in pre-school, will go back to class in Northern Ireland on 8 March. They will be followed by pupils in years 12-14 on 22 March. But Education Minister Peter Weir says there is a ""strong case"" for all pupils in Northern Ireland to return to classrooms by 8 March, claiming health officials at Stormont have been ""over-cautious"" in recommending a phased return. Speaking on the BBC's Sunday Politics programme, Chris Lyttle, an Alliance Party MLA, calls on Weir to ""step up"" over safety measures. ""We need to heed the medical and scientific advice with safety measures in place,"" says Lyttle. ""We were told we were getting additional face covering compliance and communications - that should already be in place. ""We need effective school testing, we need delivery of a special school staff vaccination programme that is now long overdue - so we need the minister to step up in those regards."" It comes as the Stormont executive prepares to meet to discuss plans for coming out of lockdown. Vaccine rollout minister Nadhim Zahawi also expresses his delight, as news emerges more than 20 million people in the UK have received their first dose of Covid-19 vaccine. ""What an achievement for February 2021,"" he writes on Twitter. He praises the many medical staff and volunteers involved in the rollout since December. ""What a team.

A 29-year-old man, who organised a party on Green Street, near Hyde Park, was put forward for a Â£10,000 fine A total of70 people have been caught breaking coronavirus rulesat two parties in one of London's most expensive neighbourhoods. Nearly Â£70,000 in fines were handed out by police after they broke up the events in Mayfair, Westminster, on Sunday morning. Each guest was fined Â£800. A 29-year-old man who organised a party on Green Street, near Hyde Park, was put forward for a Â£10,000 fine, while police are looking for the organiser of the second party, some 500m (1,600ft) away. Insp Kevin Fagan said: ""Illegal gatherings like this are irresponsible and put pressure on the emergency services who have to deal with the consequences of these people's selfish actions. ""Despite recent announcements about how and when Covid restrictions may be eased, nothing has changed in terms of the regulations. ""The rules are clear, as should be the message that the police will enforce them where wilful breaches are found to have taken place."" Kevin PeacheyPersonal finance reporter More than six million people have become
""accidental savers"" during the pandemic. While many people have faced greater debts,
redundancy, or reduced income during furlough, others have seen their financial
position improve. Fewer meals out, reduced commuting costs and
holiday cancellations and refunds has led to increased savings for some. A report, by financial consultancy LCP,
suggests six million people have seen their bank balances benefit from
fewer outgoings during the restrictions on movement. Longer-term home working could extend the
benefits, it suggests. Those aged over 55 have been most likely to save
as a result of holidays being cancelled or not booked, and older people are
also most likely to have cut back on eating out, the report says. ""There are few silver linings from the
current crisis, but the emergence of a large group of accidental savers could
be one of them,â says former pensions minister Steve Webb, a partner at LCP. This video can not be played Vaccine group phase two: What age groups are they vaccinating next? If you've not been offered a vaccine yet, you may be wondering when you're likely to be contacted. The government has now said that everyone over 50, as well as frontline health and care workers and those with certain health conditions, are expected to have been offered their first dose by mid-April. After that, the rest of the UK's adult population will be offered a jab. Health correspondent Laura Foster explains where you are in the order. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Free Covid tests will be offered to the families of all pupils in England under plans to reopen schools from 8 March. Rapid test kits will be provided twice a week to pupils and anyone in their household or support bubble regardless of whether they have symptoms. They will also be available to adults who work with schools, such as bus drivers and after-school club leaders. Meanwhile, nearly two million people aged 60 to 63 in England are being invited to book their vaccine. From Monday, people in that age bracket will start receiving letters explaining how to book a jab through the national booking service, NHS England said. Nearly 20 million people in the UKhave now received their first dose, with the government aiming to offer a first dose to all adults by the end of July. Asked whethervaccine passportsor certificates should be used to help open up the economy once this point was reached Chancellor Rishi Sunak told BBC One's Andrew Marr this threw up ""complicated, ethical issues"". However, he said the idea could be ""relevant"" for ""reopening parts of our country like mass events"" and that a government review was under way. The chancellor said the rapid progress of the vaccination rollout did not mean coronavirus restrictions could be eased earlier than set out inthe prime minister's roadmapand he could not ""guarantee"" there would be no further lockdowns. He said he had seen no signs that new variants of the virus were circulating in the country despite cases rising in some parts of England - but stressed it was important people continued following lockdown rules. When will it be my turn to be vaccinated? How many people have got the jab so far? UK reports 7,434 cases on Saturday Home testing for secondary pupils will be twice weekly, with parents expected to carry out the testing at home after three tests in school. They will be encouraged but not mandatory, with pupils from year one upwards able to take a test, the Department of Health and Social Care said. Tests will also be available to nursery school staff, the DHSC said. Public Health England said testing would help ""uncover hidden cases"" and break chains of transmission and Education Secretary Gavin Williamson said it would ""provide yet another layer of reassurance to parents and education staff that schools are as safe as possible"". Tests will be available in-person via workplace testing, at local authority testing sites or through a new ordering service that will allow people to order the kits online to collect. Anyone who tests positive will need a secondary PCR test to confirm the result of their home test. This video can not be played After phase one is complete by mid-April, in what order will all other adults get the jab? Meanwhile, more than three in four people aged between 65 and 70 have now taken up the offer of a vaccine, NHS England said. Last week, invites began to be sent out to 64-year-olds and those aged 50 to 60 are set to be invited ""shortly"", the NHS added. It said the vaccine rollout was gaining ""fresh momentum"", with medical director Prof Stephen Powis urging anyone who has been invited to take up the offer. ""It doesn't matter when you were invited you can still come forward and protect yourself and others,"" he said. The vaccine supplies are expected to increase in March, said Sir Simon Stevens, NHS England chief executive. ""We're planning for further acceleration as we head towards Easter."" People can use thenational booking service,externalto reserve a slot at NHS vaccination centres or at pharmacies. Those who cannot go online can call 119 free of charge. NHS teams are also visiting those who cannot travel to a vaccination service. It comes as leaders from 60 black-majority churches in the UK issued a call to their congregations on Sunday to get the vaccine, urging worshippers to seek out the facts about the vaccine from trusted sources. Data has suggestedpeople from black and minority ethnic (BAME) backgrounds are being vaccinated at much lower rates than white people. The Bishop of Dover, the Right Reverend Rose Hudson-Wilkin, who is among the alliance of Christian leaders, said: ""Don't let misinformation rob you of your opportunity to protect yourself and others.""

And following a return to north-east Scotland from Brazil, three Scottish residents tested positive for the new strain of coronavirus. They have been in self-isolation since their return. They are not thought to be connected to the cases in England. The tests were completed in early February and passed to the UK's advanced sequencing capabilities programme - which detected this new variant. The three people flew into London and then on to Aberdeen. Other people who were on the flight to Aberdeen are being contacted because of the concerns around the Brazil variant. Scotland's Health Secretary Jeane Freeman says: ""The identification of this new variant is a concern but we are taking every possible precaution. ""We have identified these cases thanks to our use of advanced sequencing capabilities which means we are finding more variants and mutations than many other countries and are therefore able to take action quickly."" The World Health Organization has been informed of the cases You can read more about Covid variants here. NHS Providers chief executive Chris Hopkins is praising the rollout of 20 million first doses of Covid-19 vaccines in the UK as a ""great credit to everyone involved"". But he warns ""now is not the time to let down our guard"" or ease restrictions, despite the success of the vaccination programme so far. Mr Hopkins says: ""We owe much of this success to trusts, working with colleagues in primary care with the fantastic support of so many volunteers. ""But it's important to remember there's a long way to go - we're not even close to halfway through this programme. ""And there's a further challenge, to design a workforce model to enable us to do this year in year out."" As we've been telling you,more than 20 milion people in the UK have now received a coronavirus vaccine- but many others will be wondering when it will be their turn. The next stage of the Covid-19 vaccine rollout in the UK was outlined by government scientists this week. It was announced that once the top nine priority groups had all been offered a first dose, it would be given to people by age group, rather than by profession. The Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) says the next people to be offered the jab, from around mid-April, will be, in descending order:  It also urged some groups who are at higher risk of needing hospital treatment from Covid to take up the offer of vaccination promptly:  Read more on vaccines here. As pharmaceutical giants ramp-up production in the race to vaccinate the world, one firm has shot into the lead. The Serum Institute of India (SII) isn't a household name, but it's the world's largest vaccine maker. The privately-owned firm churns out 1.5 billion doses every year from the company's vast manufacturing plant in Pune, western India. It is currently making Covid vaccines under license for pharmaceutical firms such as AstraZeneca. SII's chief executive Adar Poonawalla told the BBC the company took a ""huge calculated risk"" by betting on several vaccines in 2020. ""It wasn't a blind risk, because we knew the Oxford scientists from our earlier collaboration with the malaria vaccine,"" he said. But funding proved a challenge. The firm invested around $260m (Â£186.7m) and raised the rest from philanthropists, such as Bill Gates, and advances from other countries. SII managed to secure $800m by May 2020 to make multiple Covid vaccines. Read more here. We know the UK's coronavirus figures are often lower on a Sunday and Monday, because of a lag in reporting at weekends. But we can compare them to the figures last Sunday, when there were 9,834 new cases and 215 deaths. It means the number of deaths is 33% lower today than a week ago and the number of new cases 38.6% lower. Looking at today's figures, it is the lowest number of deaths since 13 December, which was also a Sunday, when there were also 144 new deaths recorded. And it is the lowest number of daily cases since 28 September - on that day, a Monday, there were 4,044 new cases. A further 6,035 new positive coronavirus tests have been recorded in the UK, making the total since the pandemic began 4,176,554. There have been 144 further deaths of people who had tested positive within the previous 28 days. The total number of deaths in the UK stands at 122,849, under that measure. We learned earlier that more than 20 million first doses of the vaccine have now been administered. The total is now 20,089,551 first doses, with 796,132 second doses having been given. Katie Prescott, Business correspondent Businesses are watching the Budget closely for information about the future of key support schemes, especially furlough â the job retention scheme - which is due to end in April. Since it started in March 2020, it has been key to preventing spiking unemployment but no-one expected the government to still be paying workersâ wages a year on. Let alone 4.7 million of them. With so many dependent on it, and having pledged ""support for people"", itâs difficult to see how Chancellor Rishi Sunak can end furlough while some businesses are still closed. But the scheme is not cheap. And with the countryâs debt topping Â£2tn, the same value as the UK economy, the chancellor could start to spell out plans on how he plans to pay at least some of the bill. The UKâs low corporation tax looks a likely contender for rises - although businesses that have struggled through the pandemic argue this is hitting them while theyâre down. NHS England chief executive Sir Simon Stevens has reacted to the news 20 million people in the UK have now received their first vaccine dose. He says giving this many vaccines - including to 17 million people in England alone - since December ""shows the NHS vaccination campaign is firing on all cylinders, and looking out to Easter and beyond, it's full speed ahead"". Sir Simon adds: ""As we can see from other parts of the world, having vaccines from the manufacturers versus actually administering them to patients can be two different things. ""So this latest milestone is also a tribute to careful health service planning, effective organisation and amazing teamwork across the whole of the country."" Lockdown guidelines say people ""should avoid travelling outside of your village, town or the part of a city where you live"". A police force is urging people not to become complacent after ""hundreds"" turned up at a Norfolk village beach. About 30 vehicles were parked near Sea Palling beach yesterday. Officers on patrol found people who had travelled from as far as Peterborough, 100 miles (160km) away, and Ipswich ""to walk on the beach,"" Norfolk Police said. Thecurrent lockdown guidance,externalsays people in England can exercise outdoors once per day in their area. Police urged people to ""stay as local as possible"" during the vaccine rollout and said eight fixed penalty notices were issued. Norfolk Police says it continues to ""engage, encourage and explain to people first"" before resorting to fines. Boris Johnson tweets a graphic of a ""vaccinometer"" as he celebrates the ""huge national achievement"" of more than 20 million people across the UK receiving their first dose of Covid-19 vaccine. The prime minister says the rollout success is ""a testament to the tireless work of NHS staff, volunteers, the armed forces & many more"". Echoing Health Secretary Matt Hancock, he adds: ""I urge everyone to get the jab when called. Every jab makes a difference in our battle against Covid."" Allow Twitter content?

Covid-19safety measures implemented in Northern Ireland schools to date have ""not been adequate"", according to the chair of the education committee. Children in primary 1 to primary 3 (aged four to seven), as well as those in pre-school, will go back to class in Northern Ireland on 8 March. They will be followed by pupils in years 12-14 on 22 March. But Education Minister Peter Weir says there is a ""strong case"" for all pupils in Northern Ireland to return to classrooms by 8 March, claiming health officials at Stormont have been ""over-cautious"" in recommending a phased return. Speaking on the BBC's Sunday Politics programme, Chris Lyttle, an Alliance Party MLA, calls on Weir to ""step up"" over safety measures. ""We need to heed the medical and scientific advice with safety measures in place,"" says Lyttle. ""We were told we were getting additional face covering compliance and communications - that should already be in place. ""We need effective school testing, we need delivery of a special school staff vaccination programme that is now long overdue - so we need the minister to step up in those regards.""

Kevin PeacheyPersonal finance reporter More than six million people have become
""accidental savers"" during the pandemic. While many people have faced greater debts,
redundancy, or reduced income during furlough, others have seen their financial
position improve. Fewer meals out, reduced commuting costs and
holiday cancellations and refunds has led to increased savings for some. A report, by financial consultancy LCP,
suggests six million people have seen their bank balances benefit from
fewer outgoings during the restrictions on movement. Longer-term home working could extend the
benefits, it suggests. Those aged over 55 have been most likely to save
as a result of holidays being cancelled or not booked, and older people are
also most likely to have cut back on eating out, the report says. ""There are few silver linings from the
current crisis, but the emergence of a large group of accidental savers could
be one of them,â says former pensions minister Steve Webb, a partner at LCP. This video can not be played Vaccine group phase two: What age groups are they vaccinating next?

"A coronavirus ""variant of concern"" first detected in Brazil has now been found in the UK. Three cases have been detected in England and separately three in Scotland. In England, officials are still trying to track down one of those who tested positive for the new variant. The three Scottish residents had flown to north-east Scotland from Brazil via Paris and London, the Scottish government said. Experts believe this variant (P1) - first detected in travellers to Japan from Manaus in northern Brazil in January - could be more contagious. There are also concerns vaccines may not be as effective against it - but NHS England's Prof Stephen Powis said vaccines could be ""rapidly adapted"". Dr Susan Hopkins, from Public Health England (PHE), said the UK was more advanced than many other countries in identifying the variants and mutations and therefore able to act quickly. How worrying is the Brazil coronavirus variant? More than 20m in UK have had first Covid jab In England, the first two cases are from the same household in South Gloucestershire after someone returned from Brazil on 10 February - five days before the government's hotel quarantine rule came into force. Two other people in the same household have also since tested positive for Covid - but tests are still ongoing to check if it is the same variant, so they are not included in the overall UK total of six. PHE said officials are now tracking down passengers who were on the same flight from Sao Paulo to Heathrow, via Zurich. The third case identified in England is not linked to the other two cases and the whereabouts of that person are still not known. PHE said the person did not complete their test registration card so follow-up details are unavailable. Officials are asking anyone who took a test on 12 or 13 February and who has not received a result or has an uncompleted test registration card to come forward immediately by calling 119. Meanwhile, testing is being ramped up in South Gloucestershire - on the outskirts of Bristol - with people living in five postcode areas invited to get tested even if they do not have symptoms. Thepostcodes fall within Bradley Stoke, Patchway and Little Stoke. Regarding the cases in Scotland, the government said the three people had tested positive while self-isolating. Other passengers who were on the same flight from London to Aberdeen are now being contacted. The Brazil variant is something officials are worried about because it shares similar mutations to the South Africa variant of concern. Both have undergone genetic changes that could make them more contagious and perhaps less easy to stop with our current vaccines. The coronavirus jabs being given to people now were designed around earlier versions of the pandemic virus, not these new variants. Scientists believe they should still protect, although perhaps not quite as well. Work is already under way to redesign or tweak the vaccines to make them a better match for some of these new ""variants of concern"". These updated vaccines could be ready within months, meaning the UK would have millions of doses ready to give people a booster shot before next winter to make sure the population is protected. There will be more cases out there of new variants that have not yet been identified. While it may not be possible to eliminate them, the determination is there to slow the spread of coronavirus, including new variants. Sticking to the social distancing rules will help. Both PHE and the Scottish government said the variant had been designated ""of concern"" as it shares some important mutations with the variant first identified in South Africa (known as B.1.351). One of these mutations - called E484K - may help the virus evade parts of the immune system called antibodies. It is also possible that this variant may respond less well to current vaccines, but more work is needed to understand this. In January, a coronavirus variant from Brazilwas found in the UK- but it was not this variant of concern. PHE said the ""risk to the wider community is considered low"" but as a precaution extra community testing is be rolled out in some postcodes north of Bristol. It urged people to keep following the coronavirus measures. Extra testing in the community has already been carried out for other variants elsewhere in the country Meanwhile, Labour's shadow home secretary, Nick Thomas-Symonds, said the news of the variant was ""deeply concerning"". ""It is now vital that we do everything we can to contain it,"" he said. ""But this is further proof that the delay in introducing a hotel quarantine was reckless and the continuing refusal to put in place a comprehensive system leaves us exposed to mutations coming from overseas."" The hotel quarantine rule came into forceon 15 February. It means that travellers coming to England from 33 countries - including Brazil - must pay to quarantine in a hotel for 10 days, while in Scotland the rule applies to travellers from all countries. Before that date, travellers arriving in the UK still needed to self-isolate in their homes for 10 days. All travellers to the UK also need to present a negative Covid test taken a maximum of 72 hours before their departure. Home Affairs Committee chairwoman Yvette Coopersaid on Twitter,externalit was ""notable"" that the pre-flight testsfirst brought in by the government in Januarydid not catch six cases. It comes as the UK announced another 6,035 cases of coronavirus and reported that a further 144 people had died within 28 days of a positive test.

"Lockdowns affected people's finances in different ways More than six million people have become ""accidental savers"" during the pandemic by keeping jobs while facing fewer outgoings, a report has said. While many people have faced greater debts, redundancy, or reduced income during furlough, others have seen their financial position improve. Lower travel costs and fewer holidays or meals out have contributed, financial consultancy LCP found. Longer-term home working could extend the benefits, it suggested. Millions of people have seen their finances hit hard by Covid, particularly those already on lower incomes. Pressures of bigger energy and food bills, as well as other costs owing to children remaining at home, and a 20% cut in income while on furlough, have contributed to the squeeze. More than nine million people had to borrow more than they usually would by December, owing to the coronavirus crisis, figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) showed. However, the LCP report suggests that another six million people have seen their bank balances benefit from fewer outgoings during the restrictions on movement. Many of them could have saved thousands of pounds. Employees who have been able to work from home - often not those in the youngest age groups - have seen commuting and travel costs fall. Those aged over 55 had been most likely to save as a result of holidays being cancelled or not booked, and older people were also most likely to have cut back on eating out, the report said. A lot of the saved money has stayed in regular bank accounts While some of these issues might only be temporary, the likelihood of a long-term change in the mix of office and home working could see people continue to save on travel costs. The report suggested the money saved could be put to good use by cutting existing debts, putting money aside in a rainy day fund for unforeseen emergency bills, or put into longer-term savings pots such as pensions. However, interest rates for savers are low in the current economic climate. Heidi Allan, co-author of the LCP report, said: ""Employers will have a key part to play in ensuring that workers take advantage of this opportunity and do not simply allow these increased balances to sit in current accounts and gradually drift away."" Former pensions minister Steve Webb, a partner at LCP and another author of the report, said: ""There are few silver linings from the current crisis, but the emergence of a large group of accidental savers could be one of them.Â ""A concerted effort is needed to use this unexpected opportunity to create more of a savings culture, especially among those who may permanently benefit from reduced outgoings as a result of a switch to greater home working.""

"More than 20 million people in the UK have now had their first dose of a coronavirus vaccine. Prime Minister Boris Johnson called it a ""huge national achievement"" and said ""every jab makes a difference in our battle against Covid"". The latest government figures show 20,089,551 people in the UK have now had a first dose, while 796,132 have had a second. The government is aiming to offer all adults a first jab by the end of July. But the head of NHS Providers - which represents hospital trusts in England - warned there was ""a long way to go"". ""We're not even close to half way through this programme,"" said Chris Hopson. ""And there's a further challenge: to design a workforce model to enable us to do this year in year out."" While he welcomed the milestone, he added: ""As we set out in our recent briefing, we need to see more progress on vaccines, lower Covid-19 case numbers, much less pressure on the NHS and plans in place to contain future outbreaks before easing restrictions. ""Now is not the time to let down our guard."" When will it be my turn to be vaccinated? Brazil 'variant of concern' found in UK The government's next target is to offer a first dose to all over-50s by 15 April, as well as people aged 16-64 with certain underlying health conditions and unpaid carers for disabled and elderly people. After that, people will be prioritised by age group. There are no plans yet to vaccinate children, although trialshave been announced to test the Oxford-AstraZeneca jab on children. From Monday, nearly two million people aged 60 to 63 in England will start receiving letters inviting them to book their vaccine. Mr Johnson said on Twitter that the 20 million milestone was ""a testament to the tireless work of NHS staff, volunteers, the armed forces and many more"". ""I urge everyone to get the jab when called,"" he added. Health Secretary Matt Hancockalso said,externalit was ""a magnificent achievement for the country"" and the vaccine was ""our route out"". According tothe figures published on Sunday,,externalthe 20 million milestone was reached after a further 407,503 jabs were administered in one day. The figures include: 17.1 million first doses given in England, 1.6 million first doses in Scotland, 923,615 first doses in Wales and 520,996 first doses in Northern Ireland. Meanwhile, NHS England said people in the 60-63 age bracket would start receiving letters on Monday explaining how to book a jab through the national booking service, with those aged 50 to 60 set to be invited ""shortly"". It said the vaccine rollout was gaining ""fresh momentum"", with medical director Prof Stephen Powis urging anyone who had been invited to take up the offer.

"Free Covid tests will be offered to the families of all pupils in England under plans to reopen schools from 8 March. Rapid test kits will be provided twice a week to pupils and anyone in their household or support bubble regardless of whether they have symptoms. They will also be available to adults who work with schools, such as bus drivers and after-school club leaders. Meanwhile, nearly two million people aged 60 to 63 in England are being invited to book their vaccine. From Monday, people in that age bracket will start receiving letters explaining how to book a jab through the national booking service, NHS England said. Nearly 20 million people in the UKhave now received their first dose, with the government aiming to offer a first dose to all adults by the end of July. Asked whethervaccine passportsor certificates should be used to help open up the economy once this point was reached Chancellor Rishi Sunak told BBC One's Andrew Marr this threw up ""complicated, ethical issues"". However, he said the idea could be ""relevant"" for ""reopening parts of our country like mass events"" and that a government review was under way. The chancellor said the rapid progress of the vaccination rollout did not mean coronavirus restrictions could be eased earlier than set out inthe prime minister's roadmapand he could not ""guarantee"" there would be no further lockdowns. He said he had seen no signs that new variants of the virus were circulating in the country despite cases rising in some parts of England - but stressed it was important people continued following lockdown rules. When will it be my turn to be vaccinated? How many people have got the jab so far? UK reports 7,434 cases on Saturday Home testing for secondary pupils will be twice weekly, with parents expected to carry out the testing at home after three tests in school. They will be encouraged but not mandatory, with pupils from year one upwards able to take a test, the Department of Health and Social Care said. Tests will also be available to nursery school staff, the DHSC said. Public Health England said testing would help ""uncover hidden cases"" and break chains of transmission and Education Secretary Gavin Williamson said it would ""provide yet another layer of reassurance to parents and education staff that schools are as safe as possible"". Tests will be available in-person via workplace testing, at local authority testing sites or through a new ordering service that will allow people to order the kits online to collect. Anyone who tests positive will need a secondary PCR test to confirm the result of their home test. This video can not be played After phase one is complete by mid-April, in what order will all other adults get the jab? Meanwhile, more than three in four people aged between 65 and 70 have now taken up the offer of a vaccine, NHS England said. Last week, invites began to be sent out to 64-year-olds and those aged 50 to 60 are set to be invited ""shortly"", the NHS added. It said the vaccine rollout was gaining ""fresh momentum"", with medical director Prof Stephen Powis urging anyone who has been invited to take up the offer. ""It doesn't matter when you were invited you can still come forward and protect yourself and others,"" he said. The vaccine supplies are expected to increase in March, said Sir Simon Stevens, NHS England chief executive. ""We're planning for further acceleration as we head towards Easter."" People can use thenational booking service,externalto reserve a slot at NHS vaccination centres or at pharmacies. Those who cannot go online can call 119 free of charge. NHS teams are also visiting those who cannot travel to a vaccination service. It comes as leaders from 60 black-majority churches in the UK issued a call to their congregations on Sunday to get the vaccine, urging worshippers to seek out the facts about the vaccine from trusted sources. Data has suggestedpeople from black and minority ethnic (BAME) backgrounds are being vaccinated at much lower rates than white people. The Bishop of Dover, the Right Reverend Rose Hudson-Wilkin, who is among the alliance of Christian leaders, said: ""Don't let misinformation rob you of your opportunity to protect yourself and others."" The Duke of Cambridge has alsourged people to get vaccinated. LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? YOUR QUESTIONS:We answer your queries THE R NUMBER:What it means and why it matters TEST AND TRACE:How does it work? According to the government's latest figures, more than 19.6 million people in the UKhave now received their first dose- equivalent to more than one in three adults. The number of people who have had their second jab has risen to 768,810. Elsewhere, Mr Sunak is preparing to set out details of the Budget on Wednesday as he tries to balance the strains on the public purse caused by the pandemic while supporting those who have been hit the hardest.

"This video can not be played Bethan Sayed said the 24/7 culture of her job made it ""impossible"" to raise her new family The 24/7 culture of politics needs to change, a politician who is standing down to spend more time with her son has said. Bethan Sayedannounced last week that she would not seek re-electionto the Senedd in 2021. The Plaid Cymru Member of the Senedd (MS) for South Wales West said it was ""impossible"" to raise a new family with the hours her job demands. The Senedd Commission said more could be done and changes were intended. ""Obviously I don't want to put other people off politics, but for me it was something I felt I had to do for now,"" Ms Sayed said. What is an MS? ""I think we need to change the culture. ""The demands on our time are such that people want all of us, all of the time, and it's absolutely impossible when you're trying to raise a new family so I just thought it was the right decision for me."" Bethan Sayed believes the size of the Senedd needs to increase to take pressure off individuals Ms Sayed, who has been a member of the Welsh Parliament since 2007, said her decision may have been different had there been more support available. ""I think if there had been some sort of job share initiatives, I could have returned in a part-time basis and worked with another colleague who would have been passionate about similar issues to me, then that would potentially have worked. ""Having leadership in increasing the size of our Senedd so that we can take the workload off individuals, that would have also have helped."" Work-life balance: Is a four-day week the answer? Why the future of work might be âhybridâ 'Sick and tired of feeling sick and tired' Some changes have been made by the Senedd to remove barriers - such as additional resources for members on parental leave and a contribution towards costs of childcare for those required to work beyond family-friendly hours. But Jessica Blair, director of Electoral Reform Society Cymru, called for the ""underlying issue"" of increasing the number of members to be resolved. ""We need to be looking at practical measures like job sharing, a creche for both members and support staff, flexibility in working hours and remote working,"" she said. ""But ultimately we need to stop tinkering around the edges and deal with the fundamental issue, which is that there isn't enough capacity in the Senedd, and we need more members."" The Senedd's Electoral Reform Committee is currently looking intowhether the size of the parliament should be increased from 60 to 80 or 90 members. Its report is due imminently. A spokesperson for the Senedd Commission said: ""The Senedd has evolved over the years but there is more that could be done and more changes are intended. ""Last year the first part of the Senedd and Elections Bill passed through the Senedd and the second part of the reform Bill is already on its way."" Alex Davies-Jones says she had to breastfeed her baby between votes in the lobby The spokesperson added: ""The committee that was established to look at possible developments will report on their findings soon, and this includes suggestions for ways to deal with some of the issues Bethan Sayed has raised at a Member of the Senedd. ""The independent Remuneration Board have also looked at the barriers and have introduced changes to the allowance available to Members."" But difficulties juggling politics and home life is not an issue exclusive to Cardiff Bay. MP Alex Davies-Jones was still breastfeeding and on maternity leave from her previous job when she was elected to represent Pontypridd in the UK Parliament in December 2019. ""When it was at its hardest, during the beginning, we were voting on the Brexit legislation until the early hours, debates were taking place, and then I would be sitting on the bill committees the following day and I had to stay up late in order to prepare speeches for that. ""It was really, really tough. I was breastfeeding and I had to have my husband to bring him [my son] on to the estate in order for me to feed him in between votes in the lobby. ""That was most challenging, or when he wouldn't sleep because he was teething and all he wanted was mam, and he just wanted a cuddle so it was really, really tough in the early days."" Ms Davies-Jones believes more flexible working should be possible as a result of the pandemic But Ms Davies-Jones believes the pandemic has shown more flexible working is possible. ""I think we've realised over the last few months that the working day doesn't need to be as strict as it used to be. ""We can start at a later time or start earlier to finish earlier or do split shifts or do maybe five days compressed into four. As long as the job gets done, then everybody's health and mental wellbeing should come first. ""Things definitely need to change - I mean why do we need to be voting in the early hours of the morning and why do we need to be debating until until the early hours as well? ""That's not conducive to good working or personal relationships, and it's not good for anybody's mental health or wellbeing."" The House of Commons said: ""It is vital that all MPs are able to carry out their duties and the House continues to offer support to members who may require assistance. ""Changes already agreed include allowing MPs to bring their young children through the division lobbies and into and through the Chamber while votes are taking place, and establishing the Women and Equalities Committee as a permanent committee.""

"A Â£5bn scheme for High Street shops and hospitality firms in England has been unveiled, with Rishi Sunak promising more support to come for the economy. Ahead of Wednesday's Budget, the chancellor said the grants, worth as much as Â£18,000 per firm, will help them reopen as England eases lockdown. It was broadly welcomed by firms but some groups said it was not enough. Despite concerns about the country's debt, Mr Sunak told the BBC's Marr show his priority was still jobs and firms. The chancellor said public finances faced ""enormous strains"" due to the pandemic. ""I want to level with people about the challenges we face,"" he said. But the new Â£5bn grant scheme would help people ""reopen their businesses"" and is ""the right thing to do now"", Mr Sunak said. Sunak pledges help in 'remaining stages' of crisis Budget 2021: The challenge facing Sunak He said it had been an ""incredibly difficult year"" for the High Street and hospitality sectors, and the grants would give them the ""support they need to get them through, get them back on their feet"". It was, he said, part of a range of support measures since the start of the pandemic and would continue. ""We went big, we went early - and there's more to come,"" he told Marr. This video can not be played Chancellor Rishi Sunak says the shock to the economy cannot be fixed overnight The chancellor has faced calls to raise taxes from some parts of the Tory party, while Labour and other Conservative MPs have opposed increases. There are newspaper reports this weekend suggesting Mr Sunak could freeze some income tax thresholds for three years and raise corporation tax. However, the chancellor would not comment on tax measures, saying more would be disclosed in the Budget. The government has so far borrowed Â£271bn this financial year - up Â£222bn on 2019-20. This has pushed the national debt to Â£2.13 trillion. Nearly 700,000 shops, restaurants, hotels, hair salons, gyms and other businesses in England, will be eligible for the so-called ""restart grants"", to be distributed directly to firms by local authorities from April. It will replace the current monthly grant system. The funding takes the total spent on direct grants to businesses during the pandemic to Â£25bn, the Treasury said. The devolved nations will receive equivalent extra funding. Non-essential shops in England, along with outdoor hospitality, will be allowed to reopen from 12 April at the earliest. What is the Budget and when will it happen? Will the vaccine be a Budget recovery blueprint? Other announcements ahead of Mr Sunak's annual economic speech on Wednesday, have included: a new government-backed mortgage guarantee schemefor home buyers with small deposits an ""elite"" visa to encourage high-skilled workers including researchers, engineers and scientists to come to the UK Â£126m for traineeships anda ""flexi-job"" apprenticeship in England and a ""world-first"" green savings bond for retail investors to help boost the UK's transition to net zero emissions. Mike Cherry, national chairman of the Federation of Small Businesses, welcomed the ""much-needed lifeline"" provided to businesses by the grants, but called for the chancellor to set out more funding ""for those that have been excluded from income support throughout this crisis"". UK Hospitality chief executive Kate Nicholls said businesses were ""crying out for the cash"" and urged the grants to be paid as soon as possible. And Helen Dickinson, of the British Retail Consortium, which represents chain stores, said the latest money was a ""vital injection of funding"" but warned it would ""only provide temporary relief"" if the business rate holiday did not continue. Other groups called for the extension of the furlough scheme and the temporary reduction in value added tax (VAT) on hospitality sales. Last year was the worst for the High Street in more than 25 years as the pandemic accelerated the move towards online shopping,with more than 180,000 jobs lostin retail alone, according to the Centre for Retail Research. Some Conservative MPs, such as former Brexit secretary David Davis, have spoken out against attempts to increase taxes. But Conservative former chancellor Lord Clarke has encouraged Mr Sunak to consider raising VAT, national insurance and income taxes in order to repair the public finances. Labour has said it opposes tax rises in the short-term and has called for a Â£20 uplift in universal credit to be kept. The party also called for more help for young people to avoid a ""lost generation scarred by unemployment"". On Sunday, economists at the respected EY Item Club said it was right for the chancellor to continue nursing the economy through recovery rather than introduce Budget measures to re-build the country's battered finances. Martin Beck, senior economic adviser to the Item Club, said: ""Despite an almost unprecedented peacetime deficit, serious action to repair the public finances can wait. The chancellor's focus should still be on supporting the economy through the pandemic and premature fiscal tightening could undermine recovery. ""With the cost of government debt still historically low, there is no evidence yet of any significant constraint on government borrowing."" EXPLAINED:What is the Budget and when will it happen?

"More than 20 million people across the UK have now received their first dose of Covid-19 vaccine Health Secretary Matt Hancock hails it as ""a magnificent achievement"" and says ""when you get the call, get the jab"" It is ""a testament to the tireless work of NHS staff, volunteers, the armed forces and many more"", Prime Minister Boris Johnson says The exact number of people to have been vaccinated in the UK is 20,089,551, according to the government's daily figures A further 6,035 cases have been reported in the UK and 144 more people have died within 28 days of a positive Covid test Rishi Sunak tells the BBC there has been a massive shock to the economy and his priority is to support Britain through the crisis The Chancellor, who will outline his Budget on Wednesday, tells Andrew Marr the UK's level of debt is ""going to take time"" to decrease The single-shot Johnson & Johnson coronavirus vaccine becomes the third jab to be authorised in the US A senior German immunologist urges his country to change its mind and start allowing over-65s to receive the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine Edited by James Clarke That's all from us today. We will back with more coronavirus news updates tomorrow. Our live page team today has been: James Clarke, Victoria Lindrea, Hamish Mackay and Lauren Turner. We will be bringing our live page coverage to a close soon. Before we do, here is a recap of some of the top stories we've been covering today:  Alex Pope Face-to-face counselling services can continue, subject to government guidelines More counsellors are needed due tothe rising number of young people with mental health problems in lockdown, a charity is warning. Michele Flynn, operations manager atBedford Open Door,external- a service for 13 to 25-year-olds - says it has seen a rise in the number of youngsters who have been self-harming or have suicidal thoughts. ""With schools and colleges being closed they're not getting the normal interaction from their friends and support from school staff and teachers,"" she says. ""Demand has significantly increased already and we know this is going to continue to rise."" The charity is asking qualified counsellors willing to donate two hours a week to get in touch. ""The pandemic has compounded the challenge and issues young people face. ""It could be any child from any background that could be affected and that's what we're here for,"" Flynn adds. Six cases of the Brazil variant of Covid-19 have been detected in the UK- three in Scotland and three in England. Two cases of the Manaus strain in England are from one household in South Gloucestershire with a history of travel to Brazil but the third case in England is not linked - but it is not known where that individual is. Dr Susan Hopkins, Public Health England's strategic response director for Covid-19, said: ""We have identified these cases thanks to the UK's advanced sequencing capabilities."" And following a return to north-east Scotland from Brazil, three Scottish residents tested positive for the new strain of coronavirus. They have been in self-isolation since their return. They are not thought to be connected to the cases in England. The tests were completed in early February and passed to the UK's advanced sequencing capabilities programme - which detected this new variant. The three people flew into London and then on to Aberdeen. Other people who were on the flight to Aberdeen are being contacted because of the concerns around the Brazil variant. Scotland's Health Secretary Jeane Freeman says: ""The identification of this new variant is a concern but we are taking every possible precaution. ""We have identified these cases thanks to our use of advanced sequencing capabilities which means we are finding more variants and mutations than many other countries and are therefore able to take action quickly."" The World Health Organization has been informed of the cases You can read more about Covid variants here. NHS Providers chief executive Chris Hopkins is praising the rollout of 20 million first doses of Covid-19 vaccines in the UK as a ""great credit to everyone involved"". But he warns ""now is not the time to let down our guard"" or ease restrictions, despite the success of the vaccination programme so far. Mr Hopkins says: ""We owe much of this success to trusts, working with colleagues in primary care with the fantastic support of so many volunteers. ""But it's important to remember there's a long way to go - we're not even close to halfway through this programme. ""And there's a further challenge, to design a workforce model to enable us to do this year in year out."" As we've been telling you,more than 20 milion people in the UK have now received a coronavirus vaccine- but many others will be wondering when it will be their turn. The next stage of the Covid-19 vaccine rollout in the UK was outlined by government scientists this week. It was announced that once the top nine priority groups had all been offered a first dose, it would be given to people by age group, rather than by profession. The Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) says the next people to be offered the jab, from around mid-April, will be, in descending order:  It also urged some groups who are at higher risk of needing hospital treatment from Covid to take up the offer of vaccination promptly:  Read more on vaccines here. As pharmaceutical giants ramp-up production in the race to vaccinate the world, one firm has shot into the lead. The Serum Institute of India (SII) isn't a household name, but it's the world's largest vaccine maker. The privately-owned firm churns out 1.5 billion doses every year from the company's vast manufacturing plant in Pune, western India. It is currently making Covid vaccines under license for pharmaceutical firms such as AstraZeneca. SII's chief executive Adar Poonawalla told the BBC the company took a ""huge calculated risk"" by betting on several vaccines in 2020. ""It wasn't a blind risk, because we knew the Oxford scientists from our earlier collaboration with the malaria vaccine,"" he said. But funding proved a challenge. The firm invested around $260m (Â£186.7m) and raised the rest from philanthropists, such as Bill Gates, and advances from other countries. SII managed to secure $800m by May 2020 to make multiple Covid vaccines. Read more here. We know the UK's coronavirus figures are often lower on a Sunday and Monday, because of a lag in reporting at weekends. But we can compare them to the figures last Sunday, when there were 9,834 new cases and 215 deaths. It means the number of deaths is 33% lower today than a week ago and the number of new cases 38.6% lower. Looking at today's figures, it is the lowest number of deaths since 13 December, which was also a Sunday, when there were also 144 new deaths recorded. And it is the lowest number of daily cases since 28 September - on that day, a Monday, there were 4,044 new cases. A further 6,035 new positive coronavirus tests have been recorded in the UK, making the total since the pandemic began 4,176,554. There have been 144 further deaths of people who had tested positive within the previous 28 days. The total number of deaths in the UK stands at 122,849, under that measure. We learned earlier that more than 20 million first doses of the vaccine have now been administered. The total is now 20,089,551 first doses, with 796,132 second doses having been given. Katie Prescott, Business correspondent Businesses are watching the Budget closely for information about the future of key support schemes, especially furlough â the job retention scheme - which is due to end in April. Since it started in March 2020, it has been key to preventing spiking unemployment but no-one expected the government to still be paying workersâ wages a year on. Let alone 4.7 million of them. With so many dependent on it, and having pledged ""support for people"", itâs difficult to see how Chancellor Rishi Sunak can end furlough while some businesses are still closed. But the scheme is not cheap. And with the countryâs debt topping Â£2tn, the same value as the UK economy, the chancellor could start to spell out plans on how he plans to pay at least some of the bill. The UKâs low corporation tax looks a likely contender for rises - although businesses that have struggled through the pandemic argue this is hitting them while theyâre down. NHS England chief executive Sir Simon Stevens has reacted to the news 20 million people in the UK have now received their first vaccine dose. He says giving this many vaccines - including to 17 million people in England alone - since December ""shows the NHS vaccination campaign is firing on all cylinders, and looking out to Easter and beyond, it's full speed ahead"". Sir Simon adds: ""As we can see from other parts of the world, having vaccines from the manufacturers versus actually administering them to patients can be two different things. ""So this latest milestone is also a tribute to careful health service planning, effective organisation and amazing teamwork across the whole of the country."" Lockdown guidelines say people ""should avoid travelling outside of your village, town or the part of a city where you live"". A police force is urging people not to become complacent after ""hundreds"" turned up at a Norfolk village beach. About 30 vehicles were parked near Sea Palling beach yesterday. Officers on patrol found people who had travelled from as far as Peterborough, 100 miles (160km) away, and Ipswich ""to walk on the beach,"" Norfolk Police said. Thecurrent lockdown guidance,externalsays people in England can exercise outdoors once per day in their area. Police urged people to ""stay as local as possible"" during the vaccine rollout and said eight fixed penalty notices were issued. Norfolk Police says it continues to ""engage, encourage and explain to people first"" before resorting to fines. Boris Johnson tweets a graphic of a ""vaccinometer"" as he celebrates the ""huge national achievement"" of more than 20 million people across the UK receiving their first dose of Covid-19 vaccine. The prime minister says the rollout success is ""a testament to the tireless work of NHS staff, volunteers, the armed forces & many more"". Echoing Health Secretary Matt Hancock, he adds: ""I urge everyone to get the jab when called. Every jab makes a difference in our battle against Covid."" Allow Twitter content?

But Education Minister Peter Weir says there is a ""strong case"" for all pupils in Northern Ireland to return to classrooms by 8 March, claiming health officials at Stormont have been ""over-cautious"" in recommending a phased return. Speaking on the BBC's Sunday Politics programme, Chris Lyttle, an Alliance Party MLA, calls on Weir to ""step up"" over safety measures. ""We need to heed the medical and scientific advice with safety measures in place,"" says Lyttle. ""We were told we were getting additional face covering compliance and communications - that should already be in place. ""We need effective school testing, we need delivery of a special school staff vaccination programme that is now long overdue - so we need the minister to step up in those regards."" It comes as the Stormont executive prepares to meet to discuss plans for coming out of lockdown. Vaccine rollout minister Nadhim Zahawi also expresses his delight, as news emerges more than 20 million people in the UK have received their first dose of Covid-19 vaccine. ""What an achievement for February 2021,"" he writes on Twitter. He praises the many medical staff and volunteers involved in the rollout since December. ""What a team. Proud to be with you on this journey,"" he tweets. The government is aiming to offer a first jab to all adults by
the end of July. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter. We ask for your permission before anything is loaded, as they may be using cookies and other technologies.

A 29-year-old man, who organised a party on Green Street, near Hyde Park, was put forward for a Â£10,000 fine A total of70 people have been caught breaking coronavirus rulesat two parties in one of London's most expensive neighbourhoods. Nearly Â£70,000 in fines were handed out by police after they broke up the events in Mayfair, Westminster, on Sunday morning. Each guest was fined Â£800. A 29-year-old man who organised a party on Green Street, near Hyde Park, was put forward for a Â£10,000 fine, while police are looking for the organiser of the second party, some 500m (1,600ft) away. Insp Kevin Fagan said: ""Illegal gatherings like this are irresponsible and put pressure on the emergency services who have to deal with the consequences of these people's selfish actions. ""Despite recent announcements about how and when Covid restrictions may be eased, nothing has changed in terms of the regulations. ""The rules are clear, as should be the message that the police will enforce them where wilful breaches are found to have taken place."" Kevin PeacheyPersonal finance reporter More than six million people have become
""accidental savers"" during the pandemic. While many people have faced greater debts,
redundancy, or reduced income during furlough, others have seen their financial
position improve. Fewer meals out, reduced commuting costs and
holiday cancellations and refunds has led to increased savings for some. A report, by financial consultancy LCP,
suggests six million people have seen their bank balances benefit from
fewer outgoings during the restrictions on movement. Longer-term home working could extend the
benefits, it suggests. Those aged over 55 have been most likely to save
as a result of holidays being cancelled or not booked, and older people are
also most likely to have cut back on eating out, the report says. ""There are few silver linings from the
current crisis, but the emergence of a large group of accidental savers could
be one of them,â says former pensions minister Steve Webb, a partner at LCP. This video can not be played Vaccine group phase two: What age groups are they vaccinating next? If you've not been offered a vaccine yet, you may be wondering when you're likely to be contacted. The government has now said that everyone over 50, as well as frontline health and care workers and those with certain health conditions, are expected to have been offered their first dose by mid-April. After that, the rest of the UK's adult population will be offered a jab. Health correspondent Laura Foster explains where you are in the order. Â© 2025 BBC.

"A Â£5bn scheme for High Street shops and hospitality firms in England has been unveiled, with Rishi Sunak promising more support to come for the economy. Ahead of Wednesday's Budget, the chancellor said the grants, worth as much as Â£18,000 per firm, will help them reopen as England eases lockdown. It was broadly welcomed by firms but some groups said it was not enough. Despite concerns about the country's debt, Mr Sunak told the BBC's Marr show his priority was still jobs and firms. The chancellor said public finances faced ""enormous strains"" due to the pandemic. ""I want to level with people about the challenges we face,"" he said. But the new Â£5bn grant scheme would help people ""reopen their businesses"" and is ""the right thing to do now"", Mr Sunak said. Sunak pledges help in 'remaining stages' of crisis Budget 2021: The challenge facing Sunak He said it had been an ""incredibly difficult year"" for the High Street and hospitality sectors, and the grants would give them the ""support they need to get them through, get them back on their feet"". It was, he said, part of a range of support measures since the start of the pandemic and would continue. ""We went big, we went early - and there's more to come,"" he told Marr. This video can not be played Chancellor Rishi Sunak says the shock to the economy cannot be fixed overnight The chancellor has faced calls to raise taxes from some parts of the Tory party, while Labour and other Conservative MPs have opposed increases. There are newspaper reports this weekend suggesting Mr Sunak could freeze some income tax thresholds for three years and raise corporation tax. However, the chancellor would not comment on tax measures, saying more would be disclosed in the Budget. The government has so far borrowed Â£271bn this financial year - up Â£222bn on 2019-20. This has pushed the national debt to Â£2.13 trillion. Nearly 700,000 shops, restaurants, hotels, hair salons, gyms and other businesses in England, will be eligible for the so-called ""restart grants"", to be distributed directly to firms by local authorities from April. It will replace the current monthly grant system. The funding takes the total spent on direct grants to businesses during the pandemic to Â£25bn, the Treasury said. The devolved nations will receive equivalent extra funding. Non-essential shops in England, along with outdoor hospitality, will be allowed to reopen from 12 April at the earliest. What is the Budget and when will it happen? Will the vaccine be a Budget recovery blueprint? Other announcements ahead of Mr Sunak's annual economic speech on Wednesday, have included: a new government-backed mortgage guarantee schemefor home buyers with small deposits an ""elite"" visa to encourage high-skilled workers including researchers, engineers and scientists to come to the UK Â£126m for traineeships anda ""flexi-job"" apprenticeship in England and a ""world-first"" green savings bond for retail investors to help boost the UK's transition to net zero emissions. Mike Cherry, national chairman of the Federation of Small Businesses, welcomed the ""much-needed lifeline"" provided to businesses by the grants, but called for the chancellor to set out more funding ""for those that have been excluded from income support throughout this crisis"". UK Hospitality chief executive Kate Nicholls said businesses were ""crying out for the cash"" and urged the grants to be paid as soon as possible. And Helen Dickinson, of the British Retail Consortium, which represents chain stores, said the latest money was a ""vital injection of funding"" but warned it would ""only provide temporary relief"" if the business rate holiday did not continue. Other groups called for the extension of the furlough scheme and the temporary reduction in value added tax (VAT) on hospitality sales. Last year was the worst for the High Street in more than 25 years as the pandemic accelerated the move towards online shopping,with more than 180,000 jobs lostin retail alone, according to the Centre for Retail Research. Some Conservative MPs, such as former Brexit secretary David Davis, have spoken out against attempts to increase taxes. But Conservative former chancellor Lord Clarke has encouraged Mr Sunak to consider raising VAT, national insurance and income taxes in order to repair the public finances. Labour has said it opposes tax rises in the short-term and has called for a Â£20 uplift in universal credit to be kept. The party also called for more help for young people to avoid a ""lost generation scarred by unemployment"". On Sunday, economists at the respected EY Item Club said it was right for the chancellor to continue nursing the economy through recovery rather than introduce Budget measures to re-build the country's battered finances. Martin Beck, senior economic adviser to the Item Club, said: ""Despite an almost unprecedented peacetime deficit, serious action to repair the public finances can wait. The chancellor's focus should still be on supporting the economy through the pandemic and premature fiscal tightening could undermine recovery. ""With the cost of government debt still historically low, there is no evidence yet of any significant constraint on government borrowing."" EXPLAINED:What is the Budget and when will it happen?

"It's going to be an historic Budget because of the numbers. But between the fiscal fireworks and the extension of rescue packages, Chancellor Rishi Sunak was always going to have to point the country towards a changed economy. Post-pandemic, post-Brexit and ahead of significant ""net zero"" decarbonisation challenges, the plumbing of the economy is about to change. The vaccine progress will obviously impact the timing, and perhaps the speed, of recovery from crisis. But I'm also told that the chancellor will make the argument at the Budget that the successful rollout of the Oxford-AstraZeneca coronavirus vaccine in the UK represents a model for transforming these profound medium-term changes in the economy into sustained recovery. It might be called the ""OxAz model"" of high science, big business, public participation, significant state funding and rapid regulation. Appearing alongside the head of the Oxford vaccine team at one of his pre-Budget events, the chancellor said: ""Our regulatory system has proved to be more agile and nimble and much better joined-up, than others, perhaps around the world."" 'Furlough is a lifeline, I hope they extend it' What is the Budget and when will it happen? He described the public-private partnership between government and AstraZeneca as a ""success"". Prof Sarah Gilbert, who designed the Oxford vaccine, suggested that the past year had disproved misconceptions that vaccine research was the preserve of Big Pharma: ""There's an awful lot of research that goes on in universities and in small companies. ""And we've seen some really creative partnerships really helping to move things forward."" It's well known that the government poured money into various vaccine research programmes, funding them through early stage trials and even enabling the charter of private jets to help trials, at one point. An NHS pharmacist preparing doses of the AstraZeneca Covid vaccine in Wadebridge A potential deal between Oxford University and a US drug-maker was blocked in favour of the UK's AstraZeneca, until then not a big player in vaccines. Trials took advantage of the integrated network of controlled testing available across NHS hospitals. Regulators pushed the system to allow for the same intensity of scientific trials - but in an extremely compressed timeframe. We have seen the end product of publicly-funded science, state-brokered commercialisation, big business partnership, and the logistical efforts of the NHS and volunteers working together. Are there lessons for electric car batteries, financial technology, or even new forms of food? The argument has already been deployed in favour of the new Advanced Research and Innovation Agency, modelled on the US defence agency Darpa, which had a role well before the pandemic in funding the first mRNA vaccines that paved the way for the Pfizer vaccine. In announcing that, the government said it would have a ""much higher tolerance for failure than normal"", because the ""freedom to fail is often also the freedom to succeed"". Alok Sharma's Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) justified Â£11.7bn spending on vaccines Indeed such thinking may have been present throughout the last year's rolling responses to the pandemic crisis from sourcing ventilators, and protective equipment to the test and trace system and testing technologies. The success in vaccines was pre-dated by a more mixed picture in other parts of the pandemic response. Will the government be throwing equivalent sums of money at other forms of economic innovation, as it did for vaccines? It was a risk given that no human coronavirus vaccine had ever been approved, let alone within one year. But as the National Audit Office has reported, the initial Â£11.7bn spent upfront on vaccines was justified using a cost-benefit analysis by Alok Sharma's Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS). BEIS said the money spent would bring estimated potential benefits of between ""Â£11bn and Â£231bn, excluding wider health and social benefits"". The vaccine stands on its own on that score. But as well as saving lives and helping reopen the economy, the shot in the arm could have a far longer-lasting economic effect.
