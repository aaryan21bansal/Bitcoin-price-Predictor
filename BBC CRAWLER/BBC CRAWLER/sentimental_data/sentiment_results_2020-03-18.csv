"Trade across the border will not be affected, but ""non-essential"" journeys are banned US President Donald Trump and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau have agreed to close the US-Canada border to all non-essential travel in an attempt to curb the spread of coronavirus. ""We will be, by mutual consent, temporarily closing our northern border with Canada,"" Mr Trump tweeted. He said trade would not be affected. Both countries had already issued sweeping travel bans but had maintained exemptions for each other. Canada relies on the US for approximately 75% of its exports. The two leaders discussed the changes on Wednesday, Mr Trudeau said. ""I want to be clear though that essential travel will still continue,"" he said at a press conference. ""No matter who you are or what you do, this is a time when you should be focused on your health and that of your neighbours. Not: are you going to lose your job, are you going to run out of money for food or medications."" Details of the final deal have yet to be released in writing but both leaders have stressed that cross-border trade will not be blocked. Supply chains must be preserved so trucking would not be affected, Mr Trudeau said. ""That is something we remain committed to,"" he added. About $2bn in goods and services crosses the US-Canada border each day. Canadians who needed to travel for other ""urgent reasons"" would also not be impacted, Mr Trudeau said. There is no set timeframe for how long the border closure will last. Mr Trudeau's government had previously resisted closing the border to his country's most important trading partner. ""Nearly 200,000 people cross that border every day, and that border and that traffic that goes across that border is literally a lifeline for both the Canadians and the Americans on both sides of that border,"" Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland said on Tuesday. ""We get our groceries thanks to truckers who drive back and forth across that border. Very urgently needed medical supplies and medicines go back and forth across that border."" But both leaders had kept the notion of travel restrictions on the table, as both countries have struggled to halt outbreaks of Covid-19. Earlier this week, Mr Trump warned against discretionary travel and said that ""we have very strong emergency powers when it comes to something like this, both on the southern and the northern borders"". During a White House press conference on Wednesday, Mr Trump said his administration would launch a new crackdown on migrants or asylum seekers crossing the US-Mexico border illegally in an effort to stem the coronavirus outbreak. Mr Trump said he would invoke a statute allowing America's top public health official, the surgeon general, to block people or goods from certain countries or places to prevent the spread of communicable diseases. The president said the move could happen as soon as Wednesday, but that his administration did not plan to fully close the border with Mexico. ""We're not going to close it, but we are invoking a certain provision that will allow us great latitude as to what we do,"" he said. The Mexican foreign ministry did not immediately comment. Mr Trump has made illegal immigration over the southern border his signature issue in the White House, though deportations under his administration remain lower than during the Obama era. The novel coronavirus has maintained a steady march throughout both countries. The US has nearly 8,000 cases of Covid-19 across all 50 states and has seen 138 deaths so far. Canada - which has about a ninth of the population of the US - has 598 confirmed cases, with eight deaths. EASY STEPS:How to keep safe A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? YOUR THIRD HAND:How do you clean your smartphone? GETTING READY:How prepared is the US? DOING GOOD:Kind Canadians start 'caremongering' trend President Trump has announced a stimulus proposal that could include sending a $1,000 (Â£844) cheque to every American. The president also said that all property foreclosures and tenant evictions were being suspended until the end of April. US home repossessions suspended amid virus crisis He said that his treasury chief's estimate that 20% of people could become unemployed due to the pandemic was only ""an absolute, total worst-case scenario"". On Wednesday, Mr Trudeau announced a C$82bn (US$56.4bn) aid package, including $27bn in direct support to workers and businesses. ""Our government will introduce the emergency care benefit, which will provide money every two weeks to workers who have to stay home,"" he said. This is designed for Canadians without paid sick leave who do not qualify for employment insurance. Mr Trudeau has so far stopped short of invoking Canada's Emergency Measures Act, but said ""all options are on the table"". Mr Trudeau's wife, Sophie GrÃ©goire Trudeau, tested positive for the virus last week. The prime minister has self-isolated in Ottawa, but aides say he has displayed no symptoms. British actor Idris Elba has also tested positive for the coronavirus after he was photographed hugging Canada's first lady earlier this month at a charity event in London.

"Reductions to rail timetables could take effect in the coming days, as train firms deal with staff shortages caused by the coronavirus pandemic. Services across Britain are now largely empty as most people work from home and avoid non-essential travel. Contingency plans are being made by government, Network Rail and operators to ensure that vital journeys are still possible. Certain train lines essential for emergency workers could be prioritised. Freight could be given priority in places too. The situation is so fast-moving that the detail of these plans is being worked-out day-to-day. One option is to introduce something similar to a normal Sunday service on every day of the week. On Tuesday, the Transport Secretary Grant Shapps told MPs that services would be reduced in the short-term ""to ensure we don't effectively run ghost trains."" The most pressing problem for train companies and Network Rail is staff shortages, as train drivers or signal-operators self-isolate or call-in sick. One of the biggest franchises in the country, South Western Railway, had to cancel services this morning. Other companies are also short of train crews as the virus spreads. The rules over refunds for train tickets are changing amid the crisis. Southeastern has already offered customers their money back on advance tickets. State-run LNER is offering passengers credit instead. Passenger group Transport Focus called on other operators to follow suit. People with season tickets, which they are no longer using because they are working from home or self-isolating, might qualify for a refund. Transport Focus chief executive Anthony Smith said ""people shouldn't be expected to carry on paying to get to work if they are being advised to stay at home."" The advice from the industry is to check with your rail company. The immediate drop in passengers numbers and revenue for train companies is also causing unsustainable financial pressure. So crisis talks between the Department for Transport and individual private train operators are ongoing. Rail franchise contracts are likely to be suspended, and the government will have to increase the subsidies it pays to ensure that a reduced number of trains can still run. The annual cost of running all train services in Britain is around Â£11bn. If the government covers the vast bulk of that over a matter of weeks the bill would be hundreds of millions of pounds. It is also possible that some rail franchises could be nationalised, if the talks between individual train companies and the government fail to reach a position which is commercially acceptable to both sides. Although one rail boss insisted that the mood of the talks was ""really collaborative."" ""The railway wants to play its part in a time of need"", he said. Several train franchises were already in financial trouble before the coronavirus outbreak. Negotiations concerning the UK's more troubled franchises are likely to be most complicated. Two franchises, Northern and LNER, are already run by the Government. The Eurostar between the UK and France is operating a ""minimal service"". UK government advice against all but essential travel abroad has had an impact on the service. Eurostar is a UK-based company but its main shareholder is the French state railway, SNCF. The firm said it was working closely with the UK and French governments in ""a very challenging time for the whole travel industry.""

"People have been stockpiling food, supermarket online delivery slots are full, items are restricted in stores and vulnerable people are being sent food parcels by the government. So what is being done to make sure people can get food? A total of one-and-a-half million people in England have been identified as being extremely medically vulnerable. The government has contacted 900,000 of these and has started distributing free weekly food parcels to those who have no family or friends to help them. This could eventually total more than 50,000 people. The identical parcels contain essential supplies including pasta, cereal, fruit, tea bags, and toilet paper. There have been concerns about healthy over-70s or people with other medical conditions not finding themselves eligible for these parcels. A Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs spokesperson told the BBC: ""We are working quickly to support people who do not fall into the category of being clinically vulnerable, but still need help getting essential food supplies."" In Wales, people who are extremely vulnerable will receive a letter from the country's chief medical officer. If nobody can help them get food,then from this week they can request a free weekly food box.,external Detail on schemes being set up in Scotland and Northern Ireland are set to be announced in the coming days. Branches of the main supermarkets have introduced policies to keep customers at a safe distance from one other. These include having somebody on the door controlling customer numbers, and spacing out those queuing outside. Inside, many supermarkets are providing hand sanitiser for customers and floor markers for till queues. In addition, some are putting up screens between the cashiers and the public. Other initiatives includeTescointroducing floor markings showing which direction to walk down the aisles in some of its larger stores.Morrisonshas a queuing zone if there are too many customers to be separated by the floor markings, whileAsdais bringing in directional barriers. Empty shelves caused by panic buying led to the supermarkets imposing restrictions on how many of individual items customers could buy. However, with stock levels improving, on Tuesday, Aldi, Morrisons, Waitrose and Asda lifted some of the limits. Sainsbury's will start to remove restrictions on some of its items from Sunday, while Tesco and Co-op are not changing their current restriction policies. EASY STEPS:What can I do? CONTAINMENT:What it means to self-isolate UK LATEST:What's the UK's plan and what could happen next? MAPS AND CHARTS:Visual guide to the outbreak VIDEO:The 20-second hand wash The supermarkets have introduced allotted times of the day when only the elderly, vulnerable and disabled, or NHS staff and other key workers, can shop. Several food retailers are""drastically cutting"" the range of products they sell.They are also telling manufacturers to stop making some products to focus on those for which there is greatest demand. Meanwhile, Morrisons is launching a pre-order food box collection service for NHS staff. This has been a sticking point for many people who, despite following Prime Minister Boris Johnson's request tostay at home and use online deliveries, find themselves unable to book slots. Tesco,which last weeklimited online orders to 80 items only,has now expanded its home delivery and click-and-collect services to about 780,000 slots this week - up from 660,000 two weeks ago. It has plans to add another 100,000 slots in the coming weeks. It has also recruited more than 7,500 staff and added more than 200 new vans to its fleet. The supermarket has also suspended all fees on its Delivery Saver scheme until it can offer its full service again. Asdais also recruiting more delivery drivers, whileSainsbury'shas offered priority booking slots to more than 450,000 elderly and vulnerable customers. Morrisonsis creating 3,500 new jobs to help expand its online delivery service, whileWaitrosesays it will set aside at least a quarter of its delivery slots to elderly or vulnerable people and is working to identify eligible customers. Rules have been relaxed by the government to allow supermarkets to work together. They can now share resources like distribution depots, delivery vans and staff, and co-ordinate stock levels across the country. Rules around drivers' hours have been eased and the 5p plastic bag charge is being waived for online orders, to speed up deliveries. Why are people stockpiling toilet paper?

"NHS staff say they are being put at risk during the coronavirus outbreak because of a lack of protective gear. One doctor told the BBC that frontline healthcare workers felt like ""cannon fodder"" as they do not have access to equipment such as face masks. Health workers also expressed concerns that not enough of them were being tested for the virus. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the UK had ""stockpiles"" of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE). Dr Samantha Batt-Rawden, from lobbying group the Doctors' Association, said she had heard from doctors who had not got access to PPE - or it had expired or run out. ""All these doctors are worried that that's increasing their likelihood of contracting the virus and then ultimately spreading it to patients,"" she said. Dr Frances Mair said her GP practice in Scotland - ""like many others"" - still did not have ""the PPE that we require to keep us safe"". She told BBC Newsnight that they had been told they would have it by 23 March but added ""that still seems late"". Dr Frances Mair says patients at her GP practice in Scotland are being put at risk ""Doctors and nurses and other healthcare professionals want to do the best in this pandemic and we want to look after our patients and support people who are ill but not having the correct or the best protective gear puts us and patients at risk,"" she said. ""It's very disheartening when you hear of colleagues talking about the way that they feel they are like cannon fodder, sent out to die."" Dr Nishant Joshi, who works in A&E at Luton and Dunstable general hospital, said he was only wearing a surgical mask to treat some patients, but not others being treated for non-coronavirus-related issues who ""may still be highly infectious"". He told the BBC's Emma Barnett show: ""We're fighting an invisible enemy, blindfolded, with both hands tied behind our backs and healthcare workers are at grave risk."" He compared the conditions medical staff would be working in to a warzone, saying the number ofhealth workers who fell ill in Chinashowed the severity of the situation. Health workers could face more risk because they may be exposed to higher doses of the virus. A GP from Somerset, who wanted to remain anonymous, told the BBC: ""We're underprepared, under protected and under resourced. A recipe for disaster."" EASY STEPS:How to keep safe A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? GETTING READY:How prepared is the UK? MAPS AND CHARTS:Visual guide to the outbreak TRAVEL PLANS:What are your rights? PUBLIC TRANSPORT:What's the risk? Asked during Prime Minister's Questions about the shortage of PPE, Mr Johnson said: ""Our NHS should feel that they are able to interact with patients with perfect security and protection. ""There is a massive effort going on, comparable to the effort to build enough ventilators, to ensure that we have adequate supplies of PPE equipment not just now, but throughout the outbreak."" A Department of Health and Social Care spokesman said it has ""well-established procedures to deal with supply issues, should they arise"". The UK is going to start doing 25,000 tests per day Some doctors have also called for more testing for the virus among NHS workers to prevent any unnecessary absences. Iszy Lord, 25, works at a hospital in Grimsby and lives with five other doctors - they are all self-isolating for 14 days after some of them developed symptoms. She told the BBC: ""The potential implications for self-isolating people without testing are huge. ""What's going to happen if anyone gets anything resembling a cold for the next few months, are we going to have to self-isolate for 14 days each time? It's alarming."" ""The NHS is busy and overstretched. If we are tested and don't have the virus, we could be back at work in two to three days rather than two weeks."" Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn raised the issue in the House of Commons, saying current levels of 10,000 tests per day was ""nowhere near even the number of people working in the NHS and the care sector"". On Wednesday, Mr Johnson announced that the UK would be increasing the number of tests per day from 10,000 to 25,000 and was ""prioritising testing"" for NHS staff. However, the British Medical Associationtweeted,externalthat his claim was not reflected by ""the experiences of our members at the frontline of the health service and is something we are pushing to be resolved as a matter of urgency"".

"The pound has fallen to its lowest level against the dollar since 1985, as the spread of the coronavirus pandemic spooks investors. It is currently trading at $1.15, a fall of almost 5% in just one day. It comes as financial markets tumbled again after major stimulus plans failed to quell fears about the economic impact of the virus. The Dow ended down 6.3%, while the S&P 500 fell 5.1% and the Nasdaq dropped 4.7%. Earlier the Dow and S&P 500 had plunged more than 7%, triggering an automatic temporary halt to trade, but shares recovered some ground as Congress appeared set to approve a relief bill. The pound's weakness could partly stem from questions over how the UK government plans to pay for the emergency economic measures it has introduced, says Neil Wilson, chief analyst for Markets.com. ""This is the worst sustained period of sterling selling that I can recall,"" he says. ""The government's massive fiscal package undoubtedly means more borrowing for the UK economy - how do we pay for all this?"" Meanwhile, the FTSE 100 index of top UK firms closed down 4%, with aerospace and travel firms among the hardest hit. UK Chancellor Rishi Sunak revealed aÂ£350bn stimulus package for UK firmson Tuesday, including Â£330bn of business loan guarantees. It included aid to cover a business rates holiday and grants for retailers and pubs, while help for airlines is also being considered. Despite this, investors are still flocking to the comparatively safer dollar, says Ranko Berich, head of Market Analysis at Monex Europe. ""The UK's response to the incoming coronavirus shock has been about as aggressive as possible in terms of monetary and fiscal policy, but this has done nothing to help sterling. ""Idiosyncratic factors such as the UK's monetary and fiscal response or Brexit are beside the point: this is about the US dollar, which is proving unstoppable as global financial markets stare into the abyss of crisis-like conditions,"" he said. Investors say rescue measures can only blunt the pain, as countries close borders and order mass closures, bringing most economic activity to a halt. The US on Tuesday outlined a $1tn (Â£830bn) proposal to support the world's biggest economy, which is expected to include direct payments to families, small business assistance and bailouts for airlines and other industries. US plans to pay Americans as part of $1tn stimulus Chancellor unveils Â£350bn lifeline for economy In the US, large companies have already announced more than 3,600 job cuts or furloughs, according to research firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas. The firm said some nine million other jobs at local bars and restaurants could also be at risk. Car factories in the UK and elsewhere have halted production, while the slowdown has pushedother firms such as Laura Ashley and Flybe into administration. Concerns about the damage have spurred a widespread sell-off. France's CAC 40 fell more than 6% while Germany's Dax dropped more than 5%. Oil prices also plunged to levels not seen since the early 2000s, as demand contracts sharply, but exporters boost supply. The declines have even hit gold and government debt, which are typically considered less risky assets. Asian markets have fared better than the US and Europe in recent days, but were also lower. Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 ended Wednesday 1.7% lower, the Hang Seng in Hong Kong fell by 3.3%, and China's Shanghai Composite lost 1.8%. Sterling's fall to a 35-year low against the dollar is clearly troubling. It is down 12% since the beginning of last week, and 5% today alone. This is partly down to the strengthening dollar, due to its status as a ""safe haven,"" the inevitable result of global volatility in financial markets amid the Coronavirus pandemic. But those aren't the only reasons for sterling's weakness. The pound has sunk to to just over â¬1.06 against the euro- its lowest level since the depth of the financial crisis 11 years ago. The pound is likely to be at a record low on measures of its global value, to be calculated tomorrow. At the same time, UK government borrowing costs are creeping up, with the presumption these would stay ""lower for longer"" now being tested in global debt markets. Traders have raised a range of reasons for why the UK is being particularly singled out for attention. There is growing expectation of ever bigger fiscal injections to combat the economic impact of the pandemic and the UK is still very dependent on foreign flows of capital. Its strategy for dealing with the pandemic was seen, say traders, as an outlier amongst the world's major economies. Then there is Brexit. The UK has the extra economic challenge of dealing with a fundamental change to trading arrangements with the EU, perhaps on WTO tariffs, in the middle of this pandemic. It is a very rough market out there, with some markets a little dysfunctional as traders are isolated away from their trading floors. But the UK is being singled out for especially tough treatment.

"Online shopping delivery service Ocado has suspended its online food delivery service, blaming higher demand than it can meet. Ocado said existing customers with orders would still receive them. Meanwhile, supermarkets have introduced strict limits on how many goods people can buy to try to curb stockpiling as the coronavirus pandemic escalates. Tesco, Sainsbury's and Asda will now stop shoppers buying more than three of any particular food item. Sainsbury's has also said it will prioritise vulnerable and elderly people for online deliveries. Ocado said it was experiencing ""a simply staggering amount of traffic"" to its website and more demand for products and deliveries than it could meet. ""This temporary closure will allow us to complete essential work that will help to make sure distribution of products and delivery slots is as fair and accessible as possible for all our loyal customers,"" it added. Asda and Sainsbury's buying restrictions will also apply to cleaning and toiletry products, while Tesco's limits will apply to all products. ""If you could help us by limiting demand of essential items and allowing us to focus on the core needs of our customers - we are confident that we can continue to feed the nation,"" said Tesco. Business Live: Boots boss says there's enough paracetamol What are shops doing about stockpiling? Iceland stores introduce elderly shopping hour Asda said it had seen ""a heightened demand"" for products both in stores and online. ""We have plenty of products to go around, but we have a responsibility to do the right thing for our communities to help our customers look after their loved ones in a time of need,"" it added. Asda told the BBC that cashiers and customers using self-checkout would not be able to scan more than three of the same restricted items. Sainsbury's said it was updating its tills to reflect the limits. Aldi has already introduced limits of four items per shopper on all products, while Morrisons has said it will expand its online delivery service. Consumers left shelves empty in one London Sainsbury's store as stockpiling continues Other retailers including Tesco and Boots have set limits on particularly popular products such as pasta, tissues and hand sanitiser. Boots chief executive Sebastian James said the issue was not supply, but demand. ""No supply chain can survive a sudden, unexpected global ten-fold increase in demand. And what we thought was incredibly important was that as many people as possible could get what they actually needed,"" he told the BBC's Today programme. Supermarkets' online delivery services have also been overwhelmed by the surge in demand. Before Ocado suspended its whole service it had taken down its app due to the spike in orders. Others meanwhile vented their frustration on Twitter at being one of thousands in a virtual queue to place a food order. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Supermarket chain Sainsbury's already had a two-item limit on its most popular goods, including toilet paper, soap and long-life milk. From 23 March, it said disabled customers and those over 70 will be given priority for online delivery slots. And on 19 March the first hour of shopping will be dedicated to older and vulnerable people in its 600 UK stores. The chain follows other supermarkets in introducing reserved time slots for the elderly. They include Iceland outlets across the country and all 39 Lidl stores in Northern Ireland. Sainsbury's told the BBC that it would consider future dedicated shopping hours ""in line with government guidance"", after the one-off on Thursday. Shoppers have been emptying shelves around the UK during the coronavirus outbreak Sainsbury's chief executive Mike Coupe added it was ""focusing all of our efforts on getting as much food and other essential items from our suppliers, into our warehouses and onto shelves as we possibly can. ""We still have enough food for everyone - if we all just buy what we need for us and our families."" Mr Coupe confirmed that it was closing its cafes as well as its fish, pizza and meat counters to free up more staff to work on ""keeping the shelves as well stocked as possible."" Asda will also temporarily shut down its ""non-essential"" services including its rotisserie and pizza counters to free up its workers and space in its warehouses. The announcements came as Transport Secretary Grant Shapps signed off a temporary relaxation of drivers' hours rules to deliver goods to stores around the UK. Allow Twitter content?

A Department for Transport statement said the rule change applies only to drivers supplying food and ""essential products to supermarkets"". Sainsbury's competitor Morrisons said on Tuesday it is creating 3,500 jobs to meet surging demand for its home delivery service caused by the pandemic. The chain said it would be recruiting 2,500 pickers and drivers and hiring about 1,000 people to work in distribution centres. In its preliminary results for the week ending 2 February, its chief executive David Potts said retailers were ""facing unprecedented challenges"" when dealing with Covid-19.

"Online shopping delivery service Ocado has suspended its online food delivery service, blaming higher demand than it can meet. Ocado said existing customers with orders would still receive them. Meanwhile, supermarkets have introduced strict limits on how many goods people can buy to try to curb stockpiling as the coronavirus pandemic escalates. Tesco, Sainsbury's and Asda will now stop shoppers buying more than three of any particular food item. Sainsbury's has also said it will prioritise vulnerable and elderly people for online deliveries. Ocado said it was experiencing ""a simply staggering amount of traffic"" to its website and more demand for products and deliveries than it could meet. ""This temporary closure will allow us to complete essential work that will help to make sure distribution of products and delivery slots is as fair and accessible as possible for all our loyal customers,"" it added. Asda and Sainsbury's buying restrictions will also apply to cleaning and toiletry products, while Tesco's limits will apply to all products. ""If you could help us by limiting demand of essential items and allowing us to focus on the core needs of our customers - we are confident that we can continue to feed the nation,"" said Tesco. Business Live: Boots boss says there's enough paracetamol What are shops doing about stockpiling? Iceland stores introduce elderly shopping hour Asda said it had seen ""a heightened demand"" for products both in stores and online. ""We have plenty of products to go around, but we have a responsibility to do the right thing for our communities to help our customers look after their loved ones in a time of need,"" it added. Asda told the BBC that cashiers and customers using self-checkout would not be able to scan more than three of the same restricted items. Sainsbury's said it was updating its tills to reflect the limits. Aldi has already introduced limits of four items per shopper on all products, while Morrisons has said it will expand its online delivery service. Consumers left shelves empty in one London Sainsbury's store as stockpiling continues Other retailers including Tesco and Boots have set limits on particularly popular products such as pasta, tissues and hand sanitiser. Boots chief executive Sebastian James said the issue was not supply, but demand. ""No supply chain can survive a sudden, unexpected global ten-fold increase in demand. And what we thought was incredibly important was that as many people as possible could get what they actually needed,"" he told the BBC's Today programme. Supermarkets' online delivery services have also been overwhelmed by the surge in demand. Before Ocado suspended its whole service it had taken down its app due to the spike in orders. Others meanwhile vented their frustration on Twitter at being one of thousands in a virtual queue to place a food order. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Other businesses have also announced new measures to combat the coronavirus pandemic, including: Amazon: The online retailer is stopping sellers from sending ""non-essentials"" to its US and UK warehouses to make space for sought-after baby products and groceries. Pret: From Thursday the chain will no longer allow customers to sit in-store, ""to reduce points of contact"" in shops. Selfridges: The luxury department store chain will temporarily close its four shops from 19:00 on Wednesday, but will continue trading online. EASY STEPS:How to keep safe A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? GETTING READY:How prepared is the UK? TRAVEL PLANS:What are your rights? TOUCHING STUFF:How long does it last on surfaces? Supermarket chain Sainsbury's already had a two-item limit on its most popular goods, including toilet paper, soap and long-life milk. From 23 March, it said disabled customers and those over 70 will be given priority for online delivery slots. And on 19 March the first hour of shopping will be dedicated to older and vulnerable people in its 600 UK stores. The chain follows other supermarkets in introducing reserved time slots for the elderly. They include Iceland outlets across the country and all 39 Lidl stores in Northern Ireland. Sainsbury's told the BBC that it would consider future dedicated shopping hours ""in line with government guidance"", after the one-off on Thursday. Shoppers have been emptying shelves around the UK during the coronavirus outbreak Sainsbury's chief executive Mike Coupe added it was ""focusing all of our efforts on getting as much food and other essential items from our suppliers, into our warehouses and onto shelves as we possibly can. ""We still have enough food for everyone - if we all just buy what we need for us and our families."" Mr Coupe confirmed that it was closing its cafes as well as its fish, pizza and meat counters to free up more staff to work on ""keeping the shelves as well stocked as possible."" Asda will also temporarily shut down its ""non-essential"" services including its rotisserie and pizza counters to free up its workers and space in its warehouses. The announcements came as Transport Secretary Grant Shapps signed off a temporary relaxation of drivers' hours rules to deliver goods to stores around the UK. Allow Twitter content?

"This video can not be played 'Stop, look at what's available, come and talk to us' Firms thinking of firing staff due to the coronavirus crisis should consider the support available to them first, the new Bank of England boss has said. Andrew Bailey urged UK firms to ""stop, look at what's available, come and talk to us [or] the government before you take that position"". He added that his ""big message"" for firms and citizens was that ""we will be there to support your needs"". Many firms may have to cut staff amid a slump in demand caused by the virus. Airlines, retailers, restaurants, theatres and pubs have all said they have been pushed to the brink as people are limiting all but essential social contact. Chancellor unveils Â£350bn lifeline for economy 'We have gone from Â£140,000 a year to nothing' Business Live: Boots boss says there's enough paracetamol On Tuesday, Chancellor Rishi Sunak responded with a Â£350bn stimulus package to support struggling firms, including Â£330bn of business loan guarantees. He also promised a business rates holiday and grants for retailers and pubs - although there are concerns the measures do not go far enough. Asked if the loan subsidies were available even to those companies that had already fired people, Mr Bailey told the BBC: ""I would emphasise the point that it's critical that we support the needs of the people in the country."" Asked again if the authorities were providing a ""bridge"" beyond the crisis for people who need to buy food, as well for businesses, the governor said there were ""important discussions"" going on between companies and the Treasury. The message, he said, was that ""supporting the employment and income of the people in this country is critical"". The governor, who took over from Mark Carney this week, said that the Bank does not have the powers to stop businesses paying bonuses and dividends after receipt of subsidised loans. But he said: ""I'm sure they'll get the message here."" The support given to the economy in terms of tax cuts and extra spending is likely to see sharply increased deficits. Many economists predict that the Bank of England will start buying up tens of billions of pounds more of government debt - known as quantitative easing - next week at its regular meeting. Mr Bailey said he was not going to foreshadow the meeting, and that the Bank was an independent institution, but the country had a right to expect that it would work ""in a very closely co-ordinated way with the government"". ""This is a crisis we're all in. It's an emergency situation,"" Mr Bailey said. The governor said it was his ""strong preference"" that financial markets, which have seen huge moves in recent weeks, should stay open though he was keeping ""a very close eye on the stability of markets and their integrity"". But he warned City traders not to ""exploit"" the situation by betting against businesses temporarily affected by the crisis. Mr Bailey said: ""Anybody who says, 'I can make a load of money by shorting' [aggressively betting on the value of specific companies continuing to fall] which might not be frankly in the interest of the economy, the interest of the people, just stop doing what you're doing.""

We're pausing our live coverage of the coronavirus pandemic for now but we'll continue to bring you updates across the BBC News website until our teams in Asia pick things up. So for now, here are the latest headlines: We leave you withthis piece that explains two conceptsthat many millions will need to familiarise themselves with: social distancing and self-isolation. And, as always,you can find all of our latest coronavirus stories here. As it stands, the World Health Organisation has confirmed more than 205,000 coronavirus cases worldwide, with the pandemic now affecting over 170 countries. There are many sources for tracking cases, some more reliable than others. Here is a round-up of confirmed cases in 10 the world's hardest-hit countries. We have sourced the figures either from the ongoing tally of cases by Johns Hopkins University or directly from health authorities.  Tasmania, south of the Australian mainland, has announced a state of emergency and a mandatory quarantine on arrivals to prevent the spread of the virus. This includes other Australians and locals heading home from the mainland. The only exceptions are for health and trade workers. The nation's smallest state currently has 10 cases, while there are around 270 in New South Wales and 150 in Victoria - states which have 15 times larger populations. State premier Peter Gutwein says these are the ""toughest border measures in the country"". UK medical staff say they are being put at risk during the coronavirus outbreak because of a lack of protective gear. One NHS doctor told the BBC that frontline healthcare workers felt like ""cannon fodder"" due to inadequate supplies of vital equipment such as face masks. Dr Frances Mair told Newsnight her GP practice in Scotland and ""many others"" did not have the personal protective equipment needed ""to keep us safe"". ""It's very disheartening when you hear of colleagues talking about the way that they feel they are like cannon fodder, sent out to die."" Dr Nishant Joshi, who works in A&E at Luton and Dunstable general hospital, said staff were at ""grave risk"". ""We're fighting an invisible enemy, blindfolded, with both hands tied behind our backs,"" he told Radio 5 Live's Emma Barnett. Earlier on Wednesday, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the UK had ""stockpiles"" of equipment ready to be used. Read more here.  Canada's chief public health official, Dr Theresa Tam, says there has been a ""sharp rise"" in cases over the last week that point to community spread of Covid-19. ""A number of provinces have reported cases with no links to travel,"" Dr Tam said. ""Our time to act is now."" There are currently 598 cases confirmed in Canada and eight deaths.  G'day from Australia, where it's Thursday. The nation has now recorded close to 600 cases including six deaths. Authorities are urging social distancing but standing by policies to keep schools, public transport and other ""essential"" services open. Prime Minister Scott Morrison yesterday also instructed Australians to not travel abroad - that's led to an announcement from the national carrier Qantas this morning. The airline, and its sister budget carrier Jetstar are temporarily standing down two-thirds of their 30,000 employees ""to preserve as many jobs as possible longer term"". All international flights will be suspended from late March. Virgin Australia also suspended routes yesterday. Canberra announced a raft of measures on Wednesday,catch up on those key restrictions here. The nation's central bank, the Reserve Bank of Australia is also set to announce more economic drivers today. President Donald Trump has said the US government's housing agency will stop repossessing homes until the end of April. Evictions will be suspended over the same time frame in a moratorium protecting eight million mortgages. Two US Navy hospitals ships will also be sent to help relieve an expected shortage of sick beds. Read more here A sign above a street in Venice reads: ""Everything will be alright."" The dire news from Italy is that despite a lockdown that has been in place for 10 days across the country, the death toll from this virus has continued to rise and rise. It increased by 475 on Wednesday, the biggest in one day since the outbreak began, with 319 of these deaths occuring in the northern region of Lombardy, which has been the worst-affected. Italian doctors had hoped to see infections slowing after a week of lockdown but that hasn't happened. Some say that only after two weeks - believed to be the maximum time period it takes for symptoms to show - will they truly be able to see if the virus's spread has been slowed by the drastic measures taken. The governor of Lombardy has appealed to the public to continue to stay at home and not flout the government's orders. ""Soon we will no longer be in a position to assist those who are sick,"" Attilio Fontana said earlier today. ""We are asking you to make a sacrifice to save lives.""   The number of confirmed cases in Ireland has risen by 74, bringing the total number to 366, the Department of Health has said. The cases are made up of 29 females and 45 males, it added. On Tuesday, PM Leo Varadkar said Ireland could have 15,000 cases of coronavirus before the end of March. In a St Patrick's Day address, he warned of ""significant and lasting"" economic damage and said the emergency could last into the summer.

What can you do to prevent it? The BBC's Laura Foster explains everything you need to know â in just one minute. There's one major question about this pandemic that millions of people will be hoping has a positive answer: will we see a vaccine anytime soon? Well, earlier today, we heard some promising words from the world's leading public health body. The World Health Organization (WHO) hailed an ""incredible achievement"" in the effort to produce a vaccine for the coronavirus. ""The first vaccine trial has begun, just 60 days after the genetic sequence of the coronavirus was shared,"" WHO chief Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told reporters. That trial began in the USat the Kaiser Permanente research facility in Seattle earlier this week. Four patients received the jab, which cannot cause Covid-19 but contains a harmless genetic code copied from the virus. Now for the bad news. Experts warn that it will be many months before it is clear whether this vaccine, or any of the others that are also in research, will work. And even if these initial safety tests go well, it will still take time for any potential vaccine to become available to the public. It means, realistically, one would not be ready until at least the middle of next year. But don't be too disheartened. Scientists around the world are fast-tracking research in an effort to mass produce a safe vaccine as soon as possible. Stephen McGrath, Romania Jim Turnbull decided to donate the sanitiser to his community Jim Turnbull owns a food production facility in the Romanian region of Transylvania and was due to return to the UK on Tuesday but decided to stay on. He has begun using the alcohol by-product from his elderflower gin distillation to make a hand sanitiser followingguidance by the World Health Organization,external. âGiven the crisis we thought to donate it to our local community - where we get our workforce from,â says Mr Turnbull, 68, who lives in the village of Saschiz, which has a population of some 2,000. Romania has so far had 260 confirmed cases of coronavirus but no deaths. However, its rural population, which makes up around 46% of the countryâs 19 million people, is ageing and could be vulnerable. Bars and restaurants have been shut but Bogdan Tanase, head of Romaniaâs Doctors' Alliance, told the BBC Romania was âill-prepared to deal with an epidemicâ. On Wednesday alone, police in France have handed out more than 4,000 fines to people violating government orders to stay at home. Interior Minister Christophe Castaner told local outlet TF1 that the fine has been increased from â¬35 ($38; Â£32), and can be as much as â¬375 to try to dissuade people. Since yesterday, people in France have been banned from going outside except for exercise and essential trips. During a White House briefing today, President Trump was questioned on his repeated use of the term ""Chinese virus"" to describe Covid-19 - a term critics say has contributed to racism against Asian-Americans - as well as why top US athletes have had access to tests when most Americans haven't. ""Perhaps thatâs been the story of life,"" Trump remarked.

Here some key developments from today:  Much of the world's attention has been focused on Europe, the continent that is currently the worst-affected by the coronavirus pandemic. But other developments have been reported around the world as the virus continues to spread: Prof Sian Griffiths is asked by BBC One viewers when and how will we know if these social distancing measures are working. She says: ""You can see changes in people's behaviour, but that's not very accurate. ""We will see it by a fall in the number of positive tests, the number going into hospital and sadly by the numbers who have passed away."" There has been a rise today of nearly 700 cases in the UK, and a total of 104 deaths, so BBC medical correspondent Fergus Walsh is asked, what next? ""The key message is we are all in this together,"" he says. ""We have to wash our hands, we have to comply... if we don't and if we don't see the number of cases reduce in three weeks time, what is advisory could become compulsory."" But Prof Griffiths reminds viewers: ""This too will pass."" Victoria in Belfast ""I am furious over the school closures. I am a self-employed mother of twins. I have zero support.

We're pausing our live coverage of the coronavirus pandemic for now but we'll continue to bring you updates across the BBC News website until our teams in Asia pick things up. So for now, here are the latest headlines: We leave you withthis piece that explains two conceptsthat many millions will need to familiarise themselves with: social distancing and self-isolation. And, as always,you can find all of our latest coronavirus stories here. As it stands, the World Health Organisation has confirmed more than 205,000 coronavirus cases worldwide, with the pandemic now affecting over 170 countries. There are many sources for tracking cases, some more reliable than others. Here is a round-up of confirmed cases in 10 the world's hardest-hit countries. We have sourced the figures either from the ongoing tally of cases by Johns Hopkins University or directly from health authorities.  Tasmania, south of the Australian mainland, has announced a state of emergency and a mandatory quarantine on arrivals to prevent the spread of the virus. This includes other Australians and locals heading home from the mainland. The only exceptions are for health and trade workers. The nation's smallest state currently has 10 cases, while there are around 270 in New South Wales and 150 in Victoria - states which have 15 times larger populations. State premier Peter Gutwein says these are the ""toughest border measures in the country"". UK medical staff say they are being put at risk during the coronavirus outbreak because of a lack of protective gear. One NHS doctor told the BBC that frontline healthcare workers felt like ""cannon fodder"" due to inadequate supplies of vital equipment such as face masks. Dr Frances Mair told Newsnight her GP practice in Scotland and ""many others"" did not have the personal protective equipment needed ""to keep us safe"". ""It's very disheartening when you hear of colleagues talking about the way that they feel they are like cannon fodder, sent out to die."" Dr Nishant Joshi, who works in A&E at Luton and Dunstable general hospital, said staff were at ""grave risk"". ""We're fighting an invisible enemy, blindfolded, with both hands tied behind our backs,"" he told Radio 5 Live's Emma Barnett. Earlier on Wednesday, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the UK had ""stockpiles"" of equipment ready to be used. Read more here.  Canada's chief public health official, Dr Theresa Tam, says there has been a ""sharp rise"" in cases over the last week that point to community spread of Covid-19. ""A number of provinces have reported cases with no links to travel,"" Dr Tam said. ""Our time to act is now."" There are currently 598 cases confirmed in Canada and eight deaths.  G'day from Australia, where it's Thursday. The nation has now recorded close to 600 cases including six deaths. Authorities are urging social distancing but standing by policies to keep schools, public transport and other ""essential"" services open. Prime Minister Scott Morrison yesterday also instructed Australians to not travel abroad - that's led to an announcement from the national carrier Qantas this morning. The airline, and its sister budget carrier Jetstar are temporarily standing down two-thirds of their 30,000 employees ""to preserve as many jobs as possible longer term"". All international flights will be suspended from late March. Virgin Australia also suspended routes yesterday. Canberra announced a raft of measures on Wednesday,catch up on those key restrictions here. The nation's central bank, the Reserve Bank of Australia is also set to announce more economic drivers today. President Donald Trump has said the US government's housing agency will stop repossessing homes until the end of April. Evictions will be suspended over the same time frame in a moratorium protecting eight million mortgages. Two US Navy hospitals ships will also be sent to help relieve an expected shortage of sick beds. Read more here A sign above a street in Venice reads: ""Everything will be alright."" The dire news from Italy is that despite a lockdown that has been in place for 10 days across the country, the death toll from this virus has continued to rise and rise. It increased by 475 on Wednesday, the biggest in one day since the outbreak began, with 319 of these deaths occuring in the northern region of Lombardy, which has been the worst-affected. Italian doctors had hoped to see infections slowing after a week of lockdown but that hasn't happened. Some say that only after two weeks - believed to be the maximum time period it takes for symptoms to show - will they truly be able to see if the virus's spread has been slowed by the drastic measures taken. The governor of Lombardy has appealed to the public to continue to stay at home and not flout the government's orders. ""Soon we will no longer be in a position to assist those who are sick,"" Attilio Fontana said earlier today. ""We are asking you to make a sacrifice to save lives.""   The number of confirmed cases in Ireland has risen by 74, bringing the total number to 366, the Department of Health has said. The cases are made up of 29 females and 45 males, it added. On Tuesday, PM Leo Varadkar said Ireland could have 15,000 cases of coronavirus before the end of March. In a St Patrick's Day address, he warned of ""significant and lasting"" economic damage and said the emergency could last into the summer. The government has already closed pubs, schools and universities. This video can not be played Coronavirus explained in 60 seconds What actually is the coronavirus? How might it affect you? What can you do to prevent it? The BBC's Laura Foster explains everything you need to know â in just one minute. There's one major question about this pandemic that millions of people will be hoping has a positive answer: will we see a vaccine anytime soon? Well, earlier today, we heard some promising words from the world's leading public health body. The World Health Organization (WHO) hailed an ""incredible achievement"" in the effort to produce a vaccine for the coronavirus. ""The first vaccine trial has begun, just 60 days after the genetic sequence of the coronavirus was shared,"" WHO chief Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told reporters. That trial began in the USat the Kaiser Permanente research facility in Seattle earlier this week. Four patients received the jab, which cannot cause Covid-19 but contains a harmless genetic code copied from the virus. Now for the bad news. Experts warn that it will be many months before it is clear whether this vaccine, or any of the others that are also in research, will work. And even if these initial safety tests go well, it will still take time for any potential vaccine to become available to the public. It means, realistically, one would not be ready until at least the middle of next year. But don't be too disheartened. Scientists around the world are fast-tracking research in an effort to mass produce a safe vaccine as soon as possible. Stephen McGrath, Romania Jim Turnbull decided to donate the sanitiser to his community Jim Turnbull owns a food production facility in the Romanian region of Transylvania and was due to return to the UK on Tuesday but decided to stay on. He has begun using the alcohol by-product from his elderflower gin distillation to make a hand sanitiser followingguidance by the World Health Organization,external. âGiven the crisis we thought to donate it to our local community - where we get our workforce from,â says Mr Turnbull, 68, who lives in the village of Saschiz, which has a population of some 2,000. Romania has so far had 260 confirmed cases of coronavirus but no deaths. However, its rural population, which makes up around 46% of the countryâs 19 million people, is ageing and could be vulnerable.

"NHS staff say they are being put at risk during the coronavirus outbreak because of a lack of protective gear. One doctor told the BBC that frontline healthcare workers felt like ""cannon fodder"" as they do not have access to equipment such as face masks. Health workers also expressed concerns that not enough of them were being tested for the virus. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the UK had ""stockpiles"" of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE). Dr Samantha Batt-Rawden, from lobbying group the Doctors' Association, said she had heard from doctors who had not got access to PPE - or it had expired or run out. ""All these doctors are worried that that's increasing their likelihood of contracting the virus and then ultimately spreading it to patients,"" she said. Dr Frances Mair said her GP practice in Scotland - ""like many others"" - still did not have ""the PPE that we require to keep us safe"". She told BBC Newsnight that they had been told they would have it by 23 March but added ""that still seems late"". Dr Frances Mair says patients at her GP practice in Scotland are being put at risk ""Doctors and nurses and other healthcare professionals want to do the best in this pandemic and we want to look after our patients and support people who are ill but not having the correct or the best protective gear puts us and patients at risk,"" she said. ""It's very disheartening when you hear of colleagues talking about the way that they feel they are like cannon fodder, sent out to die."" Dr Nishant Joshi, who works in A&E at Luton and Dunstable general hospital, said he was only wearing a surgical mask to treat some patients, but not others being treated for non-coronavirus-related issues who ""may still be highly infectious"". He told the BBC's Emma Barnett show: ""We're fighting an invisible enemy, blindfolded, with both hands tied behind our backs and healthcare workers are at grave risk."" He compared the conditions medical staff would be working in to a warzone, saying the number ofhealth workers who fell ill in Chinashowed the severity of the situation. Health workers could face more risk because they may be exposed to higher doses of the virus. A GP from Somerset, who wanted to remain anonymous, told the BBC: ""We're underprepared, under protected and under resourced. A recipe for disaster."" EASY STEPS:How to keep safe A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? GETTING READY:How prepared is the UK? MAPS AND CHARTS:Visual guide to the outbreak TRAVEL PLANS:What are your rights? PUBLIC TRANSPORT:What's the risk? Asked during Prime Minister's Questions about the shortage of PPE, Mr Johnson said: ""Our NHS should feel that they are able to interact with patients with perfect security and protection. ""There is a massive effort going on, comparable to the effort to build enough ventilators, to ensure that we have adequate supplies of PPE equipment not just now, but throughout the outbreak."" A Department of Health and Social Care spokesman said it has ""well-established procedures to deal with supply issues, should they arise"". The UK is going to start doing 25,000 tests per day Some doctors have also called for more testing for the virus among NHS workers to prevent any unnecessary absences. Iszy Lord, 25, works at a hospital in Grimsby and lives with five other doctors - they are all self-isolating for 14 days after some of them developed symptoms. She told the BBC: ""The potential implications for self-isolating people without testing are huge. ""What's going to happen if anyone gets anything resembling a cold for the next few months, are we going to have to self-isolate for 14 days each time? It's alarming."" ""The NHS is busy and overstretched. If we are tested and don't have the virus, we could be back at work in two to three days rather than two weeks."" Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn raised the issue in the House of Commons, saying current levels of 10,000 tests per day was ""nowhere near even the number of people working in the NHS and the care sector"". On Wednesday, Mr Johnson announced that the UK would be increasing the number of tests per day from 10,000 to 25,000 and was ""prioritising testing"" for NHS staff. However, the British Medical Associationtweeted,externalthat his claim was not reflected by ""the experiences of our members at the frontline of the health service and is something we are pushing to be resolved as a matter of urgency"".

"Coronavirus has plunged the world into uncertainty and the constant news about the pandemic can feel relentless. All of this is taking its toll on people's mental health, particularly those already living with conditions like anxiety and OCD. So how can we protect our mental health? Being concerned about the news is understandable, but for many people it can make existing mental health problems worse. When the World Health Organization released advice onprotecting your mental health during the coronavirus outbreak,external, it was broadly welcomed. As Anxiety UK's Nicky Lidbetter explains, the fear of being out of control and unable to tolerate uncertainty are common characteristics of many anxiety disorders. So it's understandable that many individuals with pre-existing anxiety are facing challenges at the moment. ""A lot of anxiety is rooted in worrying about the unknown and waiting for something to happen - coronavirus is that on a macro scale,"" agrees Rosie Weatherley, spokesperson for mental health charity Mind. So how can we protect our mental health? Reading lots of news about coronavirus has led to panic attacks for Nick, a father-of-two from Kent, who lives with anxiety. ""When I'm feeling anxious my thoughts can spiral out of control and I start thinking about catastrophic outcomes,"" he says. Nick is worried about his parents and other older people he knows. ""Usually when I suffer I can walk away from a situation. This is out of my control,"" he says. Having long periods away from news websites and social media has helped him to manage his anxiety. He has also found support helplines, run by mental health charities such as AnxietyUK, useful. Limit the amount of time you spend reading or watching things which aren't making you feel better. Perhaps decide on a specific time to check in with the news There is a lot of misinformation swirling around - stay informed by sticking to trusted sources of information such as government and NHS websites This video can not be played Tips on managing anxiety and OCD during the coronavirus pandemic Alison, 24, from Manchester, has health anxiety and feels compelled to stay informed and research the subject. But at the same time she knows social media can be a trigger. ""A month ago I was clicking on hashtags and seeing all this unverified conspiracy rubbish and it would make me really anxious and I would feel really hopeless and cry,"" she says. Now she is careful about which accounts she tunes into and is avoiding clicking on coronavirus hashtags. She is also trying hard to have time away from social media, watching TV or reading books instead. Mute key words which might be triggering on Twitter and unfollow or mute accounts Mute WhatsApp groups and hide Facebook posts and feeds if you find them too overwhelming A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? AVOIDING CONTACT:The rules on self-isolation and exercise HOPE AND LOSS:Your coronavirus stories LOOK-UP TOOL:Check cases in your area OCD Action has seen an increase in support requests from people whose fears have become focused on the coronavirus pandemic. For people with OCD and some types of anxiety, being constantly told to wash your hands can be especially difficult to hear. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

For Lily Bailey, author of Because We Are Bad, a book about living with OCD, fear of contamination was one aspect of her obsessive compulsive disorder. She says the advice about hand washing can be a huge trigger for people who have recovered. ""It's really difficult because I now have to do some of the behaviours that I've been avoiding,"" says Bailey. ""I'm sticking to the advice really rigidly but it's hard, considering that for me, soap and sanitiser used to be something comparable to an addiction."" Charity OCD Action says the issue to look out for is the function - for example, is the washing being carried out for the recommended amount of time to reduce the risk of spreading of the virus - or is it being done ritualistically in a specific order to feel ""just right""? Bailey points out that for a lot of people with OCD, getting better means being able to leave the house - so self-isolating can present another challenge. ""If we're forced to stay at home, we have lots of time on our hands, and boredom can make OCD worse,"" she says. Staying in touch with those you care about will help to maintain good mental health during long periods of self-isolation. ""Agree regular check-in times and feel connected to the people around you,"" says Weatherley. Strike a balance between having a routine and making sure each day has some variety. For some people it might end up actually feeling like quite a productive or restful period. You could work through your to-do list or read a book you'd been meaning to get to. With weeks and months of the coronavirus pandemic ahead, it is important to have down time. Mind recommends continuing to access nature and sunlight wherever possible. Do exercise, eat well and stay hydrated. AnxietyUK suggests practising the ""Apple"" technique to deal with anxiety and worries. Acknowledge:Notice and acknowledge the uncertainty as it comes to mind. Pause:Don't react as you normally do. Don't react at all. Pause and breathe. Pull back:Tell yourself this is just the worry talking, and this apparent need for certainty is not helpful and not necessary. It is only a thought or feeling. Don't believe everything you think. Thoughts are not statements or facts. Let go:Let go of the thought or feeling. It will pass. You don't have to respond to them. You might imagine them floating away in a bubble or cloud. Explore:Explore the present moment, because right now, in this moment, all is well. Notice your breathing and the sensations of your breathing. Notice the ground beneath you. Look around and notice what you see, what you hear, what you can touch, what you can smell. Right now. Then shift your focus of attention to something else - on what you need to do, on what you were doing before you noticed the worry, or do something else - mindfully with your full attention.

"This video can not be played The prime minister spoke about why the decision to close schools was taken Schools in the UK are to shut from Friday until further notice as a response to the coronavirus pandemic. Schools will close except for looking after the children of keyworkers and vulnerable children, Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said. This academic year's exams will not go ahead in England and Wales; decisions are due to be made in Scotland and Northern Ireland. It came as UK deaths reached 104 after a further 33 people died. Thirty-two were in England and one in Scotland. Confirmed cases in the UK rose to 2,626 on Wednesday, from 1,950 on Tuesday. There have been 56,221 tests carried out in the UK for Covid-19, of which 53,595 were confirmed negative. The government says it plans to more than double the number of tests being carried out in England to 25,000 a day. Follow live updates here School closures: What will happen now? Analysis: UK changes course amid death toll fears How families can cope with self-isolating together Nurseries, private schools and sixth forms are also being told to follow the guidance to close their doors.

EASY STEPS:How to keep safe A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? GETTING READY:How prepared is the UK? MAPS AND CHARTS:Visual guide to the outbreak TRAVEL PLANS:What are your rights? PUBLIC TRANSPORT:What's the risk? Questions had been asked about why the government had not moved to shut schools until now. On Monday, the PM announced a series ofnew key measuresto target the number of coronavirus cases afterscientific modelling,externalshowed the UK was on course for a ""catastrophic epidemic"". As school closures were announced on Wednesday, Mr Johnson said: ""We think now that we must apply further downward pressure with that upward curve by closing schools."" He thanked teachers and head teachers and said that by looking after children of key workers, such as NHS staff, they ""will be a critical part of the fight back"" against coronavirus. But he added that children ""should not be left"" with grandparents or others in groups vulnerable to contracting coronavirus. Revealing the shutdown of schools in England, Education Secretary Gavin Williamson told MPs assessments or exams would not go ahead this year and performance tables would not be published. But he said officials were working with exam boards ""to ensure that children get the qualifications that they need"". Schools have already been preparing for a shutdown for some time, with some creating homework packs or setting up ways of working online. But there have been concerns about the ability of frontline NHS staff and others to remain in work if their children are not in school. Chief medical officer Professor Chris Whitty told BBC One's new daily coronavirus update programme that school is ""not dangerous"" for children during the pandemic, but that the decision to close them would slow the rise of infections. He said the government and its advisers were also keen to make it possible for the children of NHS staff to go to school. In other developments: The government said it was working with UK airlines to ensure Britons overseas are able to return home amid increasing border restrictions The pound hasfallen to its lowest level against the dollar since 1985 UK supermarkets brought in strict limits on purchases Thenumber of people dying from coronavirus in Italyhas risen by 475 in one day to nearly 3,000 - the biggest increase since the outbreak.

The Ministry of Justice says 13 prisoners and four staff members are in isolation as a precaution School closure is something the health officials advising government have been continuously asked about. Their stance has always been that while it can suppress a peak - a 15% reduction has been put forward - some of the gain would be offset by the fact children will still mix outside of school. Parents, including health workers, may have to take time off work or grandparents may have to look after them, one of the vulnerable groups they are trying to protect. What is more, children are the age group least likely to get severe symptoms - only 0.2% of cases end up in hospital. In the end it has undoubtedly come down to two factors. Firstly, it might just do enough to ensure the NHS is not overwhelmed - as suggested by the new modelling by Imperial College London published on Monday. Secondly, practicalities - increasing numbers of teachers and children are having to isolate at home and classes and exams would be seriously disrupted in the coming months regardless of what was done. What is the UK's plan and what could happen next? Parents contacting the BBC expressed their concern that predicted grades might be used for results at GCSE and A-level, if pupils did not sit exams. Lone parents and self-employed parents were also worried about coping. Sarah, from Bedfordshire, said: ""I'm worried for myself and my children. ""I'm already struggling with everyone panic-buying. My children would be in a safer, cleaner environment at school."" Victoria, in Belfast, said: ""I am a self-employed mother of twins. I have zero support. ""Now I have to stay home and look after the children. Where will the money come from?"" One student, Alice Simpson, told the BBC: ""We worked so hard and the past two years has always had that long end goal - GCSEs. And it's just got to the point where that's in sight. And now it's not any more."" This video can not be played Boris Johnson confirms the government will bring forward legislation âto protect private renters from evictionâ. The National Association of Head Teachers General Secretary Paul Whiteman said: ""The government has changed what it expects schools to do. They are to offer reduced access in order to prioritise the needs of the most vulnerable young people and the children of key workers."" He added there were many complicated issues to address as a result of the announcement and the focus would be assisting heads with ""this enormous task"" and making it work on the ground. Geoff Barton, head of the Association of School and College Leaders, said many schools had already drawn up plans to support key workers and vulnerable children. ""However, this is an exceptionally demanding situation and they will need support. We will be working closely with our members and the Department for Education to this end."" By Hannah Richardson, education correspondent It was the announcement the government did not want to make - shutting down schools indefinitely. But as the virus spread its claws further into communities it became inevitable. Heads and teachers are just as at risk as anyone else, and as more and more staff called in sick - increasing numbers of schools started to fall like dominoes under the weight of this pandemic. Although the decision gives certainty for now - doors will be closed - there is even more uncertainty ahead. How long will they remain closed? How will pupils cope with learning from home? Who will look after them? And how will schools manage in their new role as the nation's babysitters for the children of key workers? Prime Minister's Questionstook place in a half-empty House of Commons earlier,after Labour and the Conservatives told MPs not scheduled to raise a query to stay away. Meanwhile, the weekly face-to-face audience between the Queen and the prime minister was carried out over the phone.

"The pound has fallen to its lowest level against the dollar since 1985, as the spread of the coronavirus pandemic spooks investors. It is currently trading at $1.15, a fall of almost 5% in just one day. It comes as financial markets tumbled again after major stimulus plans failed to quell fears about the economic impact of the virus. The Dow ended down 6.3%, while the S&P 500 fell 5.1% and the Nasdaq dropped 4.7%. Earlier the Dow and S&P 500 had plunged more than 7%, triggering an automatic temporary halt to trade, but shares recovered some ground as Congress appeared set to approve a relief bill. The pound's weakness could partly stem from questions over how the UK government plans to pay for the emergency economic measures it has introduced, says Neil Wilson, chief analyst for Markets.com. ""This is the worst sustained period of sterling selling that I can recall,"" he says. ""The government's massive fiscal package undoubtedly means more borrowing for the UK economy - how do we pay for all this?"" Meanwhile, the FTSE 100 index of top UK firms closed down 4%, with aerospace and travel firms among the hardest hit. UK Chancellor Rishi Sunak revealed aÂ£350bn stimulus package for UK firmson Tuesday, including Â£330bn of business loan guarantees. It included aid to cover a business rates holiday and grants for retailers and pubs, while help for airlines is also being considered. Despite this, investors are still flocking to the comparatively safer dollar, says Ranko Berich, head of Market Analysis at Monex Europe. ""The UK's response to the incoming coronavirus shock has been about as aggressive as possible in terms of monetary and fiscal policy, but this has done nothing to help sterling. ""Idiosyncratic factors such as the UK's monetary and fiscal response or Brexit are beside the point: this is about the US dollar, which is proving unstoppable as global financial markets stare into the abyss of crisis-like conditions,"" he said. Investors say rescue measures can only blunt the pain, as countries close borders and order mass closures, bringing most economic activity to a halt. The US on Tuesday outlined a $1tn (Â£830bn) proposal to support the world's biggest economy, which is expected to include direct payments to families, small business assistance and bailouts for airlines and other industries. US plans to pay Americans as part of $1tn stimulus Chancellor unveils Â£350bn lifeline for economy In the US, large companies have already announced more than 3,600 job cuts or furloughs, according to research firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas. The firm said some nine million other jobs at local bars and restaurants could also be at risk. Car factories in the UK and elsewhere have halted production, while the slowdown has pushedother firms such as Laura Ashley and Flybe into administration. Concerns about the damage have spurred a widespread sell-off. France's CAC 40 fell more than 6% while Germany's Dax dropped more than 5%. Oil prices also plunged to levels not seen since the early 2000s, as demand contracts sharply, but exporters boost supply. The declines have even hit gold and government debt, which are typically considered less risky assets. Asian markets have fared better than the US and Europe in recent days, but were also lower. Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 ended Wednesday 1.7% lower, the Hang Seng in Hong Kong fell by 3.3%, and China's Shanghai Composite lost 1.8%. Sterling's fall to a 35-year low against the dollar is clearly troubling. It is down 12% since the beginning of last week, and 5% today alone. This is partly down to the strengthening dollar, due to its status as a ""safe haven,"" the inevitable result of global volatility in financial markets amid the Coronavirus pandemic. But those aren't the only reasons for sterling's weakness. The pound has sunk to to just over â¬1.06 against the euro- its lowest level since the depth of the financial crisis 11 years ago. The pound is likely to be at a record low on measures of its global value, to be calculated tomorrow. At the same time, UK government borrowing costs are creeping up, with the presumption these would stay ""lower for longer"" now being tested in global debt markets. Traders have raised a range of reasons for why the UK is being particularly singled out for attention. There is growing expectation of ever bigger fiscal injections to combat the economic impact of the pandemic and the UK is still very dependent on foreign flows of capital. Its strategy for dealing with the pandemic was seen, say traders, as an outlier amongst the world's major economies. Then there is Brexit. The UK has the extra economic challenge of dealing with a fundamental change to trading arrangements with the EU, perhaps on WTO tariffs, in the middle of this pandemic. It is a very rough market out there, with some markets a little dysfunctional as traders are isolated away from their trading floors. But the UK is being singled out for especially tough treatment.

"The size of yesterday's intervention by the chancellor was impressive. At over 15% of total national income it's a package that measures up favourably against measures announced by other countries including France and the US. However, in this fast-moving environment it's not about the size and supply of credit, it's about speed and demand. Far and away the most popular measure among business owners was the immediate 12-month holiday on business rates. But to be honest, most businesses I've spoken to in the last 48 hours had no intention of paying their rates anyway. That also applies to VAT which the government may waive imminently. Hospitality groups are also circulating a template letter for members to fill in with their own details to ask for significant rent reductions. But again, many are taking matters into their own hands by withholding rent payments. But the biggest cost most businesses face are staff wages, and it is here that the government will need to think boldly and creatively to prevent what is a severe but hopefully temporary crisis turning into a long-term economic malaise. The head of the CBI has urged the government to use the National Insurance system to reverse the flow of cash from government to business. In the US, the government is considering ""helicopter money"" - using the central bank to create money which is sent directly to citizens. It is a measure of how serious the current situation is that this is getting serious consideration - having been dismissed by most during the financial crisis of ten years ago as a step too far. The supermarkets will be key in any strategy and we are already seeing them cut opening times, ration popular items and accelerate payments to their suppliers. Delivery services like Deliveroo are working up proposals to cut the price of using their app, but as one hospitality business owner told me, the problem is that ""many of these technology platforms are not yet turning a profit so their ability to help is limited"". The Business Secretary, Alok Sharma, told the BBC that new measures to help firms are imminent. Getting ahead of this crisis will be a very significant challenge. The usual rule book is being ripped up. One question that business owners are repeatedly asking me is whether the government is serious about pressing ahead with a potentially disruptive departure from the EU this December. Ministers have already conceded that there will be additional cost and friction - HMRC estimates that over 200 million additional customs declarations will cost UK businesses Â£6.5bn and require considerable management focus. Given that the negotiations will be severely disrupted by this health emergency - many are asking whether it would be wiser to request an extension of the transition period beyond the end of December.

"Coronavirus is spreading in the UK and the government is seeking ways to minimise its spread. Without drastic measures - which could be in place for weeks, or even months - it is feared that more than 250,000 people could die. All members of the public should reduce the time they spend with others: Everyone should stop non-essential contact with others. This is particularly important for people over 70, those with underlying health conditions and pregnant women People should work from home if they can Cafes, pubs and restaurants are being closed from Friday night - except for take-away food - to tackle coronavirus People should stop all unnecessary travel Those most at risk - about 1.5 million who've had organ transplants, have severe respiratory conditions or some cancers - should not go out for 12 weeks, and will be given essential supplies if they don't have a support system of their own Everyone should continue to regularly wash their hands and avoid contacting the NHS unless it's essential. The strongest warnings are in place for those who are ill and the people close to them: Anyone with a fever or persistent cough should stay at home for seven days Anyone who lives with someone displaying coronavirus symptoms should also stay at home for 14 days.People who have to isolate themselvesshould ask others for help The government's thinking has changed quickly. It started off trying to contain coronavirus by isolating people who tested positive and asking anyone who had close contact with them to self-isolate too. Ministers then introduced policies to delay and reduce the peak, when the most cases are expected. The idea was that by pushing it back to the summer it would allow the NHS to cope. But modelling from Imperial College London prompted a change in approach. It warned the policy of a managed spread could lead to more than 250,000 deaths, with hospital intensive care units getting overwhelmed. Ministers are now seeking to suppress the spread completely. They hope this will keep deaths below 20,000. We are in uncharted territory - so it is impossible to tell. However, Prime Minister Boris Johnson has suggested that""we can turn the tide within the next 12 weeks"". But the problem with trying to suppress the virus is that as soon as you lift those measures the fear is it could quickly return. One option from experts advising the government is to go through a cycle of lifting and reapplying restrictions, using demand on intensive care as a guide. There will be close attention paid to China, which is now looking at how it lifts restrictions. It is not realistic to think that if you temporarily break the spread of coronavirus it will go away. Then you have to consider the social and economic factors at play. Businesses are going to struggle and people are going to lose their jobs. And how long are the public going to put up with being told they cannot go out, need to work from home and can no longer watch sport or go to festivals? It leaves the government with some very difficult decisions to take. EASY STEPS:What can I do? A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? MAPS AND CHARTS:Visual guide to the outbreak VIDEO:The 20-second hand wash The whole of the NHS has been put on an emergency footing. From mid-April all routine operations, such as knee and hip replacements, are being cancelled for three months. Hospitals have plans to keep coronavirus patients separate and supply staff with protective masks and suits. All hospital patients with flu-like symptoms are being tested. Patients with mild symptoms - a high temperature or new and persistent cough - are being asked to self-isolate at home. Community teams will keep an eye on them if need be. But people are being advised not to ring NHS 111 to report their symptoms unless they are worried. Currently there is no treatment or cure, so hospitals are trying to relieve the symptoms. Specialist ECMO breathing equipment is at five units for patients whose lungs fail. There are between 4,000 and 5,000 intensive care beds. But NHS officials said they can effectively increase that to between 11,000 and 12,000 by using ventilators reserved for planned surgery and those available in the private sector, Ministry of Defence, new ones being made and old stocks that are no longer used. Ministers are also working with private companies to ramp up production. A third of patients who need hospital care require intensive care support, evidence from China and Italy suggests. Doctors warn that some difficult decisions may need to be made about which patients get treatment. What questions do you have about the UK's coronavirus plans?

We're pausing our live coverage of the coronavirus pandemic for now but we'll continue to bring you updates across the BBC News website until our teams in Asia pick things up. So for now, here are the latest headlines: We leave you withthis piece that explains two conceptsthat many millions will need to familiarise themselves with: social distancing and self-isolation. And, as always,you can find all of our latest coronavirus stories here. As it stands, the World Health Organisation has confirmed more than 205,000 coronavirus cases worldwide, with the pandemic now affecting over 170 countries. There are many sources for tracking cases, some more reliable than others. Here is a round-up of confirmed cases in 10 the world's hardest-hit countries. We have sourced the figures either from the ongoing tally of cases by Johns Hopkins University or directly from health authorities.  Tasmania, south of the Australian mainland, has announced a state of emergency and a mandatory quarantine on arrivals to prevent the spread of the virus. This includes other Australians and locals heading home from the mainland. The only exceptions are for health and trade workers. The nation's smallest state currently has 10 cases, while there are around 270 in New South Wales and 150 in Victoria - states which have 15 times larger populations. State premier Peter Gutwein says these are the ""toughest border measures in the country"". UK medical staff say they are being put at risk during the coronavirus outbreak because of a lack of protective gear. One NHS doctor told the BBC that frontline healthcare workers felt like ""cannon fodder"" due to inadequate supplies of vital equipment such as face masks. Dr Frances Mair told Newsnight her GP practice in Scotland and ""many others"" did not have the personal protective equipment needed ""to keep us safe"". ""It's very disheartening when you hear of colleagues talking about the way that they feel they are like cannon fodder, sent out to die."" Dr Nishant Joshi, who works in A&E at Luton and Dunstable general hospital, said staff were at ""grave risk"". ""We're fighting an invisible enemy, blindfolded, with both hands tied behind our backs,"" he told Radio 5 Live's Emma Barnett. Earlier on Wednesday, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the UK had ""stockpiles"" of equipment ready to be used. Read more here.  Canada's chief public health official, Dr Theresa Tam, says there has been a ""sharp rise"" in cases over the last week that point to community spread of Covid-19. ""A number of provinces have reported cases with no links to travel,"" Dr Tam said. ""Our time to act is now."" There are currently 598 cases confirmed in Canada and eight deaths.  G'day from Australia, where it's Thursday. The nation has now recorded close to 600 cases including six deaths. Authorities are urging social distancing but standing by policies to keep schools, public transport and other ""essential"" services open. Prime Minister Scott Morrison yesterday also instructed Australians to not travel abroad - that's led to an announcement from the national carrier Qantas this morning. The airline, and its sister budget carrier Jetstar are temporarily standing down two-thirds of their 30,000 employees ""to preserve as many jobs as possible longer term"". All international flights will be suspended from late March. Virgin Australia also suspended routes yesterday.

The dire news from Italy is that despite a lockdown that has been in place for 10 days across the country, the death toll from this virus has continued to rise and rise. It increased by 475 on Wednesday, the biggest in one day since the outbreak began, with 319 of these deaths occuring in the northern region of Lombardy, which has been the worst-affected. Italian doctors had hoped to see infections slowing after a week of lockdown but that hasn't happened. Some say that only after two weeks - believed to be the maximum time period it takes for symptoms to show - will they truly be able to see if the virus's spread has been slowed by the drastic measures taken.

There's one major question about this pandemic that millions of people will be hoping has a positive answer: will we see a vaccine anytime soon? Well, earlier today, we heard some promising words from the world's leading public health body. The World Health Organization (WHO) hailed an ""incredible achievement"" in the effort to produce a vaccine for the coronavirus. ""The first vaccine trial has begun, just 60 days after the genetic sequence of the coronavirus was shared,"" WHO chief Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told reporters. That trial began in the USat the Kaiser Permanente research facility in Seattle earlier this week. Four patients received the jab, which cannot cause Covid-19 but contains a harmless genetic code copied from the virus. Now for the bad news. Experts warn that it will be many months before it is clear whether this vaccine, or any of the others that are also in research, will work. And even if these initial safety tests go well, it will still take time for any potential vaccine to become available to the public. It means, realistically, one would not be ready until at least the middle of next year. But don't be too disheartened. Scientists around the world are fast-tracking research in an effort to mass produce a safe vaccine as soon as possible.

"Schools in Scotland and Wales are to close from Friday in response to the coronavirus epidemic. It is expected the UK government will announce shortly that schools in England will follow suit. Scotland First Minister Nicola Sturgeon says schools have now lost too many staff to continue as normal. The coronavirus death toll in the UK has now reached 104 after the NHS said a further 32 people had died in England after testing positive. Confirmed coronavirus cases in the UK rose to 2,626 on Wednesday, from 1,950 on Tuesday. There have been 56,221 tests carried out in the UK for Covid-19, of which 53,595 were confirmed negative. The government says it plans to more than double the number of tests being carried out in England to 25,000 a day. It comes as frontline doctors expressed concerns about the lack of testing among NHS staff and the shortage of protective equipment. Meanwhile, thegovernment is bringing forward emergency legislation to protect private rentersfrom eviction after being urged to do more for them.

The Ministry of Justice says 13 prisoners and four staff members are in isolation as a precaution The move on schools in Scotland and Wales will be welcomed by headteachers who have been struggling to keep their doors open, with growing numbers of staff and pupils off school. Schools have been pressing for a decision on keeping them open over the past week. Schools have been preparing for a shut down for some time, with some creating homework packs or setting up ways of working online. But there have been concerns about the ability of frontline NHS staff and others to remain in work if their children are not in school. Headteachers' leaders have been meeting regularly with the education secretary over the last few days. They have been seeking to balance between keeping their staff and pupils safe in the face of the virus outbreak, and the need for vulnerable pupils to be supported. The prime minister's official spokesman stated that the possibility of school closures had always been part of the plan ""should the medical and scientific advice state that was the right step to take and that we have reached the right moment to do so"". Prime Minister's Questions took place in a half-empty House of Commons Prime Minister's Questionstook place in a half-empty House of Commons, after Labour and the Conservatives told MPs not scheduled to raise a query to stay away.

Childcare centres are expected to remain open until further advice is given, Ms Williams added. Ms Sturgeon saidschools and nurseries across Scotland would close from the end of this weekand may not reopen before the summer. Northern Ireland's education minister Peter Weir said he could not give a date for school closures but any shutdown could potentially last until the start of the autumn term. On help for renters, Kate Henderson, of the National Housing Federation, confirmed housing associations would not evict tenants who were affected by the virus and fell behind with their rent. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn urged the prime minister to protect renters in ""the interests of public health"", saying Britain's 20m private renters were ""worried sick"" about missing payments if they became ill, lost pay or had to self-isolate.

"This video can not be played The prime minister spoke about why the decision to close schools was taken Schools in the UK are to shut from Friday until further notice as a response to the coronavirus pandemic. Schools will close except for looking after the children of keyworkers and vulnerable children, Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said. This academic year's exams will not go ahead in England and Wales; decisions are due to be made in Scotland and Northern Ireland. It came as UK deaths reached 104 after a further 33 people died. Thirty-two were in England and one in Scotland. Confirmed cases in the UK rose to 2,626 on Wednesday, from 1,950 on Tuesday. There have been 56,221 tests carried out in the UK for Covid-19, of which 53,595 were confirmed negative. The government says it plans to more than double the number of tests being carried out in England to 25,000 a day. Follow live updates here School closures: What will happen now? Analysis: UK changes course amid death toll fears How families can cope with self-isolating together Nurseries, private schools and sixth forms are also being told to follow the guidance to close their doors. Scotland and Wales earlier said schools would close from Friday while schools in Northern Ireland will close to pupils today and to staff on 23 March. This video can not be played NHS TV campaign advert on the virus crisis Meanwhile thegovernment is bringing forward emergency legislation to protect private rentersfrom eviction after being urged to do more for them And a new advert,fronted by the UK's chief medical officer Professor Chris Whittyand being run across TV, radio and the internet, reminds people to stay at home even if they only have mild symptoms. EASY STEPS:How to keep safe A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? GETTING READY:How prepared is the UK? MAPS AND CHARTS:Visual guide to the outbreak TRAVEL PLANS:What are your rights? PUBLIC TRANSPORT:What's the risk? Questions had been asked about why the government had not moved to shut schools until now. On Monday, the PM announced a series ofnew key measuresto target the number of coronavirus cases afterscientific modelling,externalshowed the UK was on course for a ""catastrophic epidemic"". As school closures were announced on Wednesday, Mr Johnson said: ""We think now that we must apply further downward pressure with that upward curve by closing schools."" He thanked teachers and head teachers and said that by looking after children of key workers, such as NHS staff, they ""will be a critical part of the fight back"" against coronavirus. But he added that children ""should not be left"" with grandparents or others in groups vulnerable to contracting coronavirus. Revealing the shutdown of schools in England, Education Secretary Gavin Williamson told MPs assessments or exams would not go ahead this year and performance tables would not be published. But he said officials were working with exam boards ""to ensure that children get the qualifications that they need"". Schools have already been preparing for a shutdown for some time, with some creating homework packs or setting up ways of working online. But there have been concerns about the ability of frontline NHS staff and others to remain in work if their children are not in school. Chief medical officer Professor Chris Whitty told BBC One's new daily coronavirus update programme that school is ""not dangerous"" for children during the pandemic, but that the decision to close them would slow the rise of infections. He said the government and its advisers were also keen to make it possible for the children of NHS staff to go to school.

The Ministry of Justice says 13 prisoners and four staff members are in isolation as a precaution School closure is something the health officials advising government have been continuously asked about. Their stance has always been that while it can suppress a peak - a 15% reduction has been put forward - some of the gain would be offset by the fact children will still mix outside of school. Parents, including health workers, may have to take time off work or grandparents may have to look after them, one of the vulnerable groups they are trying to protect. What is more, children are the age group least likely to get severe symptoms - only 0.2% of cases end up in hospital. In the end it has undoubtedly come down to two factors. Firstly, it might just do enough to ensure the NHS is not overwhelmed - as suggested by the new modelling by Imperial College London published on Monday. Secondly, practicalities - increasing numbers of teachers and children are having to isolate at home and classes and exams would be seriously disrupted in the coming months regardless of what was done. What is the UK's plan and what could happen next? Parents contacting the BBC expressed their concern that predicted grades might be used for results at GCSE and A-level, if pupils did not sit exams. Lone parents and self-employed parents were also worried about coping. Sarah, from Bedfordshire, said: ""I'm worried for myself and my children. ""I'm already struggling with everyone panic-buying. My children would be in a safer, cleaner environment at school."" Victoria, in Belfast, said: ""I am a self-employed mother of twins. I have zero support. ""Now I have to stay home and look after the children. Where will the money come from?"" One student, Alice Simpson, told the BBC: ""We worked so hard and the past two years has always had that long end goal - GCSEs. And it's just got to the point where that's in sight. And now it's not any more."" This video can not be played Boris Johnson confirms the government will bring forward legislation âto protect private renters from evictionâ. The National Association of Head Teachers General Secretary Paul Whiteman said: ""The government has changed what it expects schools to do. They are to offer reduced access in order to prioritise the needs of the most vulnerable young people and the children of key workers."" He added there were many complicated issues to address as a result of the announcement and the focus would be assisting heads with ""this enormous task"" and making it work on the ground. Geoff Barton, head of the Association of School and College Leaders, said many schools had already drawn up plans to support key workers and vulnerable children. ""However, this is an exceptionally demanding situation and they will need support. We will be working closely with our members and the Department for Education to this end."" By Hannah Richardson, education correspondent It was the announcement the government did not want to make - shutting down schools indefinitely. But as the virus spread its claws further into communities it became inevitable. Heads and teachers are just as at risk as anyone else, and as more and more staff called in sick - increasing numbers of schools started to fall like dominoes under the weight of this pandemic. Although the decision gives certainty for now - doors will be closed - there is even more uncertainty ahead. How long will they remain closed? How will pupils cope with learning from home? Who will look after them? And how will schools manage in their new role as the nation's babysitters for the children of key workers? Prime Minister's Questionstook place in a half-empty House of Commons earlier,after Labour and the Conservatives told MPs not scheduled to raise a query to stay away. Meanwhile, the weekly face-to-face audience between the Queen and the prime minister was carried out over the phone.

"The size of yesterday's intervention by the chancellor was impressive. At over 15% of total national income it's a package that measures up favourably against measures announced by other countries including France and the US. However, in this fast-moving environment it's not about the size and supply of credit, it's about speed and demand. Far and away the most popular measure among business owners was the immediate 12-month holiday on business rates. But to be honest, most businesses I've spoken to in the last 48 hours had no intention of paying their rates anyway. That also applies to VAT which the government may waive imminently. Hospitality groups are also circulating a template letter for members to fill in with their own details to ask for significant rent reductions. But again, many are taking matters into their own hands by withholding rent payments. But the biggest cost most businesses face are staff wages, and it is here that the government will need to think boldly and creatively to prevent what is a severe but hopefully temporary crisis turning into a long-term economic malaise. The head of the CBI has urged the government to use the National Insurance system to reverse the flow of cash from government to business. In the US, the government is considering ""helicopter money"" - using the central bank to create money which is sent directly to citizens. It is a measure of how serious the current situation is that this is getting serious consideration - having been dismissed by most during the financial crisis of ten years ago as a step too far. The supermarkets will be key in any strategy and we are already seeing them cut opening times, ration popular items and accelerate payments to their suppliers. Delivery services like Deliveroo are working up proposals to cut the price of using their app, but as one hospitality business owner told me, the problem is that ""many of these technology platforms are not yet turning a profit so their ability to help is limited"". The Business Secretary, Alok Sharma, told the BBC that new measures to help firms are imminent. Getting ahead of this crisis will be a very significant challenge. The usual rule book is being ripped up. One question that business owners are repeatedly asking me is whether the government is serious about pressing ahead with a potentially disruptive departure from the EU this December. Ministers have already conceded that there will be additional cost and friction - HMRC estimates that over 200 million additional customs declarations will cost UK businesses Â£6.5bn and require considerable management focus. Given that the negotiations will be severely disrupted by this health emergency - many are asking whether it would be wiser to request an extension of the transition period beyond the end of December.

The government will bring forward emergency legislation to protect private renters from eviction, Boris Johnson has said. Tenants were ""worried sick"" they might not be able to pay rents if they fell ill, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said at Prime Minister's Questions. As Wales and Scotland said they would close schools by Friday Mr Johnson said a decision on England was imminent. It came after Chancellor Rishi Sunak announced Â£350bn of help for companies. On Tuesday, the chancellor promised mortgage ""holidays"", Â£330bn in loans and Â£20bn in other aid. The government had been urged to do more for families, workers and tenants affected by coronavirus. Mr Corbyn urged the PM to protect private renters in ""the interests of public health"", adding Britain's 20m private renters were ""worried sick"" about missing payments if they became ill, lost pay or had to self-isolate. MPs practiced the government's social distancing advice in sitting apart during Prime Minister's Questions Mr Johnson said it will bring forward legislation to protect private renters from eviction, but will also avoid ""pass[ing] on the problem"" by ""taking steps to protect other actors in the economy"".

Analysis: Holes remain in bold virus plans Virus-hit tenants 'should get a rent break' Sainsbury's takes steps to help elderly shoppers Rachel Reeves, Labour chairwoman of the Commons Business Committee, said there was nothing in the chancellor's announcement to offer financial support to people who were already on statutory sick pay, self-isolating or had been laid off. And unions raised concerns there were no measures to help freelancers and people working in the gig economy. The additional measures came after the publicwere told to avoid all non-essential contact and travel. By next weekend, those with the most serious health conditions must be ""largely shielded from social contact for around 12 weeks"", under thelatest government guidance,external. Some doctors have called for more testing for the virus among NHS workers to prevent any unnecessary absences. Speaking at PMQs, Mr Johnson said testing for the virus is to be ramped up to 25,000 tests a day, following criticism too few were being carried out. The testing will be more than doubled in England, after a prior government commitment to boost tests from 2,000 to 10,000 a day. Commercial equipment will be brought in to boost the capacity currently available in the NHS and via Public Health England. Mr Johnson also confirmed that the UK is getting ""much closer"" to having a generally available test to determine whether someone has had coronavirus. He added the government is making a ""massive effort"" to ensure healthcare staff have enough protective equipment to wear while treating patients. Leading scientists at Porton Down, the Ministry of Defence's highly secure research laboratory in Wiltshire, have been called in to help deal with the spread of coronavirus, the BBC has been told. A team of about 10 defence scientists are working with public health officials to analyse the spread of the virus and to help with testing. The number of people who have died with the virus in the UK reached 71 on Tuesday,after a second death was confirmed in Scotland, as well asa second in Walesand a further 14 in England. A man in his 40s with motor neurone disease (MND) is thought tobe the youngest person in the UK to have died having tested positive for coronavirus. Craig Ruston, understood to be 45, died in Kettering, Northamptonshire, on Monday morning and his chest infection was diagnosed as Covid-19. The government's chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance said it would be a ""good outcome"" for the UK if the number of deaths from the virus could be kept below 20,000. Some 2,626 people have tested positive for the virus in the UK, according to the latest Department of Health figures - but the actual number of cases could be as high as 55,000.

"Online shopping delivery service Ocado has suspended its online food delivery service, blaming higher demand than it can meet. Ocado said existing customers with orders would still receive them. Meanwhile, supermarkets have introduced strict limits on how many goods people can buy to try to curb stockpiling as the coronavirus pandemic escalates. Tesco, Sainsbury's and Asda will now stop shoppers buying more than three of any particular food item. Sainsbury's has also said it will prioritise vulnerable and elderly people for online deliveries. Ocado said it was experiencing ""a simply staggering amount of traffic"" to its website and more demand for products and deliveries than it could meet. ""This temporary closure will allow us to complete essential work that will help to make sure distribution of products and delivery slots is as fair and accessible as possible for all our loyal customers,"" it added. Asda and Sainsbury's buying restrictions will also apply to cleaning and toiletry products, while Tesco's limits will apply to all products. ""If you could help us by limiting demand of essential items and allowing us to focus on the core needs of our customers - we are confident that we can continue to feed the nation,"" said Tesco. Business Live: Boots boss says there's enough paracetamol What are shops doing about stockpiling? Iceland stores introduce elderly shopping hour Asda said it had seen ""a heightened demand"" for products both in stores and online. ""We have plenty of products to go around, but we have a responsibility to do the right thing for our communities to help our customers look after their loved ones in a time of need,"" it added. Asda told the BBC that cashiers and customers using self-checkout would not be able to scan more than three of the same restricted items. Sainsbury's said it was updating its tills to reflect the limits. Aldi has already introduced limits of four items per shopper on all products, while Morrisons has said it will expand its online delivery service. Consumers left shelves empty in one London Sainsbury's store as stockpiling continues Other retailers including Tesco and Boots have set limits on particularly popular products such as pasta, tissues and hand sanitiser. Boots chief executive Sebastian James said the issue was not supply, but demand. ""No supply chain can survive a sudden, unexpected global ten-fold increase in demand. And what we thought was incredibly important was that as many people as possible could get what they actually needed,"" he told the BBC's Today programme. Supermarkets' online delivery services have also been overwhelmed by the surge in demand. Before Ocado suspended its whole service it had taken down its app due to the spike in orders. Others meanwhile vented their frustration on Twitter at being one of thousands in a virtual queue to place a food order. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The chain follows other supermarkets in introducing reserved time slots for the elderly. They include Iceland outlets across the country and all 39 Lidl stores in Northern Ireland. Sainsbury's told the BBC that it would consider future dedicated shopping hours ""in line with government guidance"", after the one-off on Thursday. Shoppers have been emptying shelves around the UK during the coronavirus outbreak Sainsbury's chief executive Mike Coupe added it was ""focusing all of our efforts on getting as much food and other essential items from our suppliers, into our warehouses and onto shelves as we possibly can. ""We still have enough food for everyone - if we all just buy what we need for us and our families."" Mr Coupe confirmed that it was closing its cafes as well as its fish, pizza and meat counters to free up more staff to work on ""keeping the shelves as well stocked as possible."" Asda will also temporarily shut down its ""non-essential"" services including its rotisserie and pizza counters to free up its workers and space in its warehouses. The announcements came as Transport Secretary Grant Shapps signed off a temporary relaxation of drivers' hours rules to deliver goods to stores around the UK. Allow Twitter content?

Sainsbury's competitor Morrisons said on Tuesday it is creating 3,500 jobs to meet surging demand for its home delivery service caused by the pandemic. The chain said it would be recruiting 2,500 pickers and drivers and hiring about 1,000 people to work in distribution centres. In its preliminary results for the week ending 2 February, its chief executive David Potts said retailers were ""facing unprecedented challenges"" when dealing with Covid-19. Despite the increased uncertainty, it said it had seen sales increase in recent weeks due to customers stockpiling. How do I get a food parcel?

"The pound has fallen to its lowest level against the dollar since 1985, as the spread of the coronavirus pandemic spooks investors. It is currently trading at $1.15, a fall of almost 5% in just one day. It comes as financial markets tumbled again after major stimulus plans failed to quell fears about the economic impact of the virus. The Dow ended down 6.3%, while the S&P 500 fell 5.1% and the Nasdaq dropped 4.7%. Earlier the Dow and S&P 500 had plunged more than 7%, triggering an automatic temporary halt to trade, but shares recovered some ground as Congress appeared set to approve a relief bill. The pound's weakness could partly stem from questions over how the UK government plans to pay for the emergency economic measures it has introduced, says Neil Wilson, chief analyst for Markets.com. ""This is the worst sustained period of sterling selling that I can recall,"" he says. ""The government's massive fiscal package undoubtedly means more borrowing for the UK economy - how do we pay for all this?"" Meanwhile, the FTSE 100 index of top UK firms closed down 4%, with aerospace and travel firms among the hardest hit. UK Chancellor Rishi Sunak revealed aÂ£350bn stimulus package for UK firmson Tuesday, including Â£330bn of business loan guarantees. It included aid to cover a business rates holiday and grants for retailers and pubs, while help for airlines is also being considered. Despite this, investors are still flocking to the comparatively safer dollar, says Ranko Berich, head of Market Analysis at Monex Europe. ""The UK's response to the incoming coronavirus shock has been about as aggressive as possible in terms of monetary and fiscal policy, but this has done nothing to help sterling. ""Idiosyncratic factors such as the UK's monetary and fiscal response or Brexit are beside the point: this is about the US dollar, which is proving unstoppable as global financial markets stare into the abyss of crisis-like conditions,"" he said. Investors say rescue measures can only blunt the pain, as countries close borders and order mass closures, bringing most economic activity to a halt. The US on Tuesday outlined a $1tn (Â£830bn) proposal to support the world's biggest economy, which is expected to include direct payments to families, small business assistance and bailouts for airlines and other industries. US plans to pay Americans as part of $1tn stimulus Chancellor unveils Â£350bn lifeline for economy In the US, large companies have already announced more than 3,600 job cuts or furloughs, according to research firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas. The firm said some nine million other jobs at local bars and restaurants could also be at risk. Car factories in the UK and elsewhere have halted production, while the slowdown has pushedother firms such as Laura Ashley and Flybe into administration. Concerns about the damage have spurred a widespread sell-off. France's CAC 40 fell more than 6% while Germany's Dax dropped more than 5%. Oil prices also plunged to levels not seen since the early 2000s, as demand contracts sharply, but exporters boost supply. The declines have even hit gold and government debt, which are typically considered less risky assets. Asian markets have fared better than the US and Europe in recent days, but were also lower. Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 ended Wednesday 1.7% lower, the Hang Seng in Hong Kong fell by 3.3%, and China's Shanghai Composite lost 1.8%. Sterling's fall to a 35-year low against the dollar is clearly troubling. It is down 12% since the beginning of last week, and 5% today alone. This is partly down to the strengthening dollar, due to its status as a ""safe haven,"" the inevitable result of global volatility in financial markets amid the Coronavirus pandemic. But those aren't the only reasons for sterling's weakness. The pound has sunk to to just over â¬1.06 against the euro- its lowest level since the depth of the financial crisis 11 years ago. The pound is likely to be at a record low on measures of its global value, to be calculated tomorrow. At the same time, UK government borrowing costs are creeping up, with the presumption these would stay ""lower for longer"" now being tested in global debt markets. Traders have raised a range of reasons for why the UK is being particularly singled out for attention. There is growing expectation of ever bigger fiscal injections to combat the economic impact of the pandemic and the UK is still very dependent on foreign flows of capital. Its strategy for dealing with the pandemic was seen, say traders, as an outlier amongst the world's major economies. Then there is Brexit. The UK has the extra economic challenge of dealing with a fundamental change to trading arrangements with the EU, perhaps on WTO tariffs, in the middle of this pandemic. It is a very rough market out there, with some markets a little dysfunctional as traders are isolated away from their trading floors. But the UK is being singled out for especially tough treatment.

"Trade across the border will not be affected, but ""non-essential"" journeys are banned US President Donald Trump and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau have agreed to close the US-Canada border to all non-essential travel in an attempt to curb the spread of coronavirus. ""We will be, by mutual consent, temporarily closing our northern border with Canada,"" Mr Trump tweeted. He said trade would not be affected. Both countries had already issued sweeping travel bans but had maintained exemptions for each other. Canada relies on the US for approximately 75% of its exports. The two leaders discussed the changes on Wednesday, Mr Trudeau said. ""I want to be clear though that essential travel will still continue,"" he said at a press conference. ""No matter who you are or what you do, this is a time when you should be focused on your health and that of your neighbours. Not: are you going to lose your job, are you going to run out of money for food or medications."" Details of the final deal have yet to be released in writing but both leaders have stressed that cross-border trade will not be blocked. Supply chains must be preserved so trucking would not be affected, Mr Trudeau said. ""That is something we remain committed to,"" he added. About $2bn in goods and services crosses the US-Canada border each day. Canadians who needed to travel for other ""urgent reasons"" would also not be impacted, Mr Trudeau said. There is no set timeframe for how long the border closure will last. Mr Trudeau's government had previously resisted closing the border to his country's most important trading partner. ""Nearly 200,000 people cross that border every day, and that border and that traffic that goes across that border is literally a lifeline for both the Canadians and the Americans on both sides of that border,"" Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland said on Tuesday. ""We get our groceries thanks to truckers who drive back and forth across that border. Very urgently needed medical supplies and medicines go back and forth across that border."" But both leaders had kept the notion of travel restrictions on the table, as both countries have struggled to halt outbreaks of Covid-19. Earlier this week, Mr Trump warned against discretionary travel and said that ""we have very strong emergency powers when it comes to something like this, both on the southern and the northern borders"". During a White House press conference on Wednesday, Mr Trump said his administration would launch a new crackdown on migrants or asylum seekers crossing the US-Mexico border illegally in an effort to stem the coronavirus outbreak. Mr Trump said he would invoke a statute allowing America's top public health official, the surgeon general, to block people or goods from certain countries or places to prevent the spread of communicable diseases. The president said the move could happen as soon as Wednesday, but that his administration did not plan to fully close the border with Mexico. ""We're not going to close it, but we are invoking a certain provision that will allow us great latitude as to what we do,"" he said. The Mexican foreign ministry did not immediately comment. Mr Trump has made illegal immigration over the southern border his signature issue in the White House, though deportations under his administration remain lower than during the Obama era. The novel coronavirus has maintained a steady march throughout both countries. The US has nearly 8,000 cases of Covid-19 across all 50 states and has seen 138 deaths so far. Canada - which has about a ninth of the population of the US - has 598 confirmed cases, with eight deaths. EASY STEPS:How to keep safe A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? YOUR THIRD HAND:How do you clean your smartphone? GETTING READY:How prepared is the US? DOING GOOD:Kind Canadians start 'caremongering' trend President Trump has announced a stimulus proposal that could include sending a $1,000 (Â£844) cheque to every American. The president also said that all property foreclosures and tenant evictions were being suspended until the end of April. US home repossessions suspended amid virus crisis He said that his treasury chief's estimate that 20% of people could become unemployed due to the pandemic was only ""an absolute, total worst-case scenario"". On Wednesday, Mr Trudeau announced a C$82bn (US$56.4bn) aid package, including $27bn in direct support to workers and businesses. ""Our government will introduce the emergency care benefit, which will provide money every two weeks to workers who have to stay home,"" he said. This is designed for Canadians without paid sick leave who do not qualify for employment insurance. Mr Trudeau has so far stopped short of invoking Canada's Emergency Measures Act, but said ""all options are on the table"". Mr Trudeau's wife, Sophie GrÃ©goire Trudeau, tested positive for the virus last week. The prime minister has self-isolated in Ottawa, but aides say he has displayed no symptoms. British actor Idris Elba has also tested positive for the coronavirus after he was photographed hugging Canada's first lady earlier this month at a charity event in London.

"This video can not be played Joe Biden addresses Bernie Sanders' supporters: ""I hear you... I know what we have to do"" Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden has steamrolled rival Bernie Sanders in primary elections in Florida, Illinois and Arizona. Accelerating his momentum in the race, the former US vice-president made a clean sweep in all three states. Mr Biden appealed for support directly to Sanders supporters. With his hat-trick, Mr Biden took another big stride towards becoming the Democratic candidate who will face President Donald Trump in November. Mr Biden won a smashing victory over Mr Sanders in Florida, the biggest prize of the night with 219 delegates. The former vice-president won 62% of the vote and about 130 delegates. Mr Sanders, with only 23%, took some 48 delegates, with the rest still to be distributed. Mr Trump won that traditional battleground state by 1.2 percentage points in the 2016 presidential election. In Illinois, with most precincts reporting, Mr Biden led the Vermont senator by 59% to 36%. With most votes counted in Arizona, Mr Biden has a double-digit lead over Mr Sanders in the south-western state. A Democratic candidate needs 1,991 delegates to clinch the nomination. Will Joe Biden's record come back to haunt him? On the eve of Tuesday's vote, Mr Biden was hoping to build on his victories in 16 of the last 21 state contests. The former US vice-president's triumph last month in South Carolina - his first ever primary win over three campaigns for president - resuscitated his faltering campaign. According to opinion polling, most voters said electability was a priority for them. About three in four Florida voters said Mr Biden would have a better chance of beating Mr Trump, a Republican. Just one in five said the same of Mr Sanders. Older voters were more likely to say they supported Mr Biden. Nearly half of Florida's voters said Mr Sanders' stances were too liberal. This video can not be played What unites these two bitter rivals? In a webcam speech from his home in Wilmington, Delaware, to comply with US anti-coronavirus advice against public gatherings, Mr Biden appealed to Mr Sanders' passionate supporters. He said: ""Let me say, especially to the young voters who have been inspired by Senator Sanders, I hear you, I know what's at stake, I know what we have to do."" But he focused largely on the outbreak sweeping the US, striking a unifying tone as he said: ""The coronavirus doesn't care if you're a Democrat or a Republican... we're all in this together."" Mr Sanders hosted an online address from Washington DC, but he did not drop any hints about the future of his campaign. He instead talked about the coronavirus crisis, outlining proposals to address the pandemic, which he said would cost some $2tn. Eighteen things Bernie Sanders believes How much does Sanders want to spend? This video can not be played Biden will have to win over young voters like Alexis and Amira. Democrats in three states have just cemented the presidential nomination for Joe Biden. Bernie Sanders was soundly defeated in Illinois and Arizona and routed in Florida, where in one county he finished third behind Michael Bloomberg, who dropped out weeks ago. He will fall even further behind in the national convention delegate count, as the primary season appears to be heading towards suspended animation, with multiple states delaying their contests until June. Mr Sanders should have a long think about how long he wants to stay in this fight, even if he does have more than enough financial resources to carry on. He is going to face growing calls from Democrats to gracefully bow out - something he did not do until the eve of the convention four years ago, much to the consternation of many Hillary Clinton supporters. The bottom line for Mr Sanders may be evaluating what's best for the movement he created. Will staying in the race give him a continuing platform to talk about his issues and buy him time for a potential comeback? Or will hanging around only increase the chances that he is relegated to an electoral afterthought? Read Anthony's full takeaways Also on Tuesday night, the US president officially clinched the Republican party nomination with a win in the Illinois primary. His victory had been a foregone conclusion in a contest where he has faced only nominal opposition from a former Massachusetts Governor, Bill Weld. Illinois' delegates drove Mr Trump over the 1,276-delegate threshold required to become the party's standard-bearer. Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel congratulated the president on Twitter for ""officially becoming the presumptive Republican nominee"". This video can not be played Biden curses Michigan voter who said he's taking Americans' guns. Ohio was also due to hold a primary on Tuesday, but it cancelled the vote hours before polls were due to open, putting it off till June. Voters in the three states that did head to polling stations on Tuesday encountered hand sanitiser dispensers and workers in surgical gloves. Several other states have postponed their Democratic presidential primaries, including Georgia, Louisiana, Maryland and Kentucky. Coronavirus-wary voters cast their ballots in Florida The Democratic National Committee blasted Ohio for sowing ""chaos and confusion"" and urged remaining primary states not to follow suit. But Puerto Rico, which is scheduled to hold the next Democratic primary on 29 March, is also planning to reschedule. Party grandees are encouraging states and territories instead to extend postal and early voting to reduce public exposure to the virus. On Tuesday, the US Secret Service said it would this week begin providing full protection for Mr Biden. His codename will be Celtic, the same as when he was vice-president. Mr Biden requested the security detail after being repeatedly accosted by protesters on the campaign trail. Two protesters rushed a stage in Los Angeles earlier this month and came within a stride of the candidate as he gave a victory speech. Mr Sanders has not made a request for Secret Service protection.

"Heptathlete Johnson-Thompson (left) and pole vault champion Stefanidi have expressed concerns The International Olympic Committee says it has held ""constructive"" talks with athlete representatives about the coronavirus crisis. President Thomas Bach admitted he was ""confronted with many questions"" over qualification and restrictions. But he also insisted that ""everybody realised that we still have more than four months to go"" until Tokyo 2020. The summer showpiece is still scheduled to begin on 24 July despite the cancellation of other sports events. There has been mounting criticism from athletes, with the IOC accused of putting them ""in danger"" by insisting it remains fully committed to the Games. Olympic champion Katerina Stefanidi said the IOC was ""risking our health"", while Britain's Katarina Johnson-Thompson said training had become ""impossible"". Speaking in an in-house IOC interview, Bach said: ""We have just had a really great call with 220 athlete representatives from all around the world, it was very constructive and gave us a lot of insight. ""We aimed to continue being very realistic in our analysis. We will keep acting in a responsible way that is in the interest of the athletes whilst always respecting our two principles - the safeguarding and health of the athletes and contributing to the containment of the virus, and secondly to protect the interest of the athletes and Olympic sport."" British four-time Olympic rowing gold medallist Matthew Pinsent criticised Bach's comments onTwitter,,externalaccusing him of not properly listening to athletes' concerns and stating that postponing the Olympics is the best option for all concerned. ""I'm sorry Mr Bach but this is tone deaf. The instinct to keep safe is not compatible with athlete training, travel and focus that a looming Olympics demands of athletes, spectators and organisers,"" Pinsent wrote. ""Keep them safe. Call it off."" Earlier, in a statement, the IOC had warned ""no solution will be ideal"" in preparing for Tokyo 2020. ""This is an exceptional situation which requires exceptional solutions,"" it said. ""The IOC is committed to finding a solution with the least negative impact for the athletes, while protecting the integrity of the competition and the athletes' health. ""No solution will be ideal in this situation, and this is why we are counting on the responsibility and solidarity of the athletes."" Johnson-Thompson shared this image with the caption ""10 minutes left on these streets before France goes into complete lockdown"" World heptathlon champion Johnson-Thompson, 27, is returning to the UK from her training base in France as a result of the countrybeing in lockdown. Tokyo 2020 organisers have pledged todeliver a ""complete"" Gamesbut Johnson-Thompson said current guidance from the International Olympic Committee (IOC) is confusing. She said: ""The IOC advice 'encourages athletes to continue to prepare for the Olympic Games as best as they can' with the Olympics only four months away but the government legislation is enforcing isolation at home, with tracks, gyms and public spaces closed. ""I feel under pressure to train and keep the same routine, which is impossible. ""I'm in a very fortunate place given the circumstances. I'm healthy, well supported and I have already qualified for the Olympics. But at this moment it's difficult to approach the season when everything has changed in the lead up apart from the ultimate deadline."" All club training sessions, events, competitions, club committee and face-to-face meetings, athlete camps, running groups and social events have been suspended across England, Scotland and Wales. Several athletes have joined Johnson-Thompson in pointing to confusion on how they should prepare. British race walker Tom Bosworth told BBC Sport: ""I don't think there is enough time to properly build towards a games, whether that is build athlete profiles, build the teams, allow people to qualify who haven't qualified and celebrate an Olympic Games in an Olympic year as it should be. ""I think for all involved, a slight delay is probably the best option."" Stefanidi, who won gold for Greece in pole vault at Rio 2016, said: ""This is not about how things will be in four months. This is about how things are now. ""The IOC wants us to keep risking our health, our family's health and public health to train every day? You are putting us in danger right now, today, not in four months."" Hayley Wickenheiser, a member of the IOC, has said the Olympic governing body's decision to""move ahead, with such conviction, is insensitive and irresponsible given the state of humanity."" Spanish Olympic Committee (COE) president Alejandro Blanco has told Reuters he wouldprefer this year's Games be postponed.,external About 57% of the athletes set to attend the Games have so far qualified. On Tuesday, the IOC asked athletes to continue preparations ""as best they can"". Jessica Judd, who represented Britain over 5,000m at the 2019 World Championships, tweeted: ""How on earth are we meant to carry on preparing best we can? ""Will someone share with me what races we can do to get times and whether trials will go ahead and when training can return to normal?"" Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has insisted the Games will go ahead as planned in July. Events including the handover of the Olympic torch in Athenshave faced disruption.

"People queue to enter Singapore from Malaysia before a travel ban started Many Asian nations are facing an increasing battle to stem the spread of coronavirus, amid a World Health Organization warning that some needed to take ""aggressive measures"". Malaysia, Sri Lanka and the Philippines are among nations imposing strict border controls. Cases in the South Asian subcontinent are still below 500 but there are fears a spike could overwhelm health systems. There are 185,000 cases globally, with 7,500 confirmed deaths. Some nations and territories that had seen success in controlling the virus or slowing its arrival, including South Korea, Hong Kong and Taiwan, have seen new spikes, amid fears people returning from abroad are importing the virus. LIVE UPDATES:Follow the latest developments here EASY STEPS:How to keep safe A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? NEW MEASURES:What is the UK advice? TRAVEL PLANS:What are your rights? Asian stocks have continued to fallas worries about the coronavirus pandemic eclipsed hopes that major stimulus plans would ease the impact of the outbreak. It was issued for the organisation's South East Asia region, although this contains 11 nations spread widely, including Indonesia, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Bangladesh and North Korea. Poonam Khetrapal Singh, regional director of the WHO South East Asia region, said on Tuesday that ""more clusters of virus transmission are being confirmed"". Thai officials monitor arrivals at Suvarnabhumi International Airport in Bangkok ""We need to immediately scale up all efforts to prevent the virus from infecting more people,"" Dr Khetrapal Singh said. ""We clearly need to do more, and urgently."" The WHO said the numbers in its South East Asia region showed that ""some countries are clearly heading towards community transmission of Covid-19"". It called for continued efforts to ""detect, test, treat, isolate and trace contacts"". Dr Khetrapal Singh said ""practising social distancing [could] not be emphasised enough... this alone has the potential to substantially reduce transmission"". ""We need to act now,"" she said. Many regional countries inside and outside the WHO's definition of South East Asia have had a slow response to the outbreak, only taking drastic measures in recent weeks or days as the number of cases continue to grow. Almost all nations are seeing increases, although the rates vary widely. China still has the highest number of confirmed cases, with more than 80,000, but its new infections are almost exclusively from people arriving from abroad and are very low. South Korea has also been praised for its attempts to control the virus and its 8,413 cases have seen it fall below Germany to sixth inthe running list of cases compiled by Johns Hopkins University,external. South Korea has seen a cluster of new cases It has been ahead of other nations by testing thousands of people and had seen a downward trend in new infections. But there are now small clusters breaking out across the country, with 93 more cases in the past 24 hours. Dozens of sick and elderly patients in a hospital in Daegu were infected. Taiwan announced its largest single-day increase in new cases - 23 - bringing the total to 100. The trend was mirrored in Hong Kong - 14 cases in a single day is the highest in the territory, all but one brought in from abroad. Indonesia on Wednesday also announced its biggest daily rise, 55 more cases taking the total to 227, with 19 deaths. Pakistan's cases have now risen to 245, with the total of reported cases for the South Asian subcontinent reaching 482. Hong Kong is one region fearing a spike in cases imported from abroad Thailand reported 35 new cases on Wednesday, taking its total infections to 212, officials said. Four of the cases were linked to an entertainment venue and 13 to a boxing bout, both in Bangkok. Malaysia has warned of a fresh spike in cases, saying there is only a ""slim chance"" of breaking the chain of infections. A mass Muslim gathering last month is linked to nearly two-thirds of its infections and thousands of attendees are yet to be tested. Myanmar and Laos have both not reported any cases - though experts have seriously doubted the credibility of this. A spokesperson for Myanmar's government claimed that people's ""lifestyle and diet"" had protected them from the virus. But it has imposed restrictions on arrivals and the UK government is now advising against all but essential travel there. There are also no reported cases of the virus in Timor-Leste.

Streets in the Malaysian capital Kuala Lumpur were largely empty and supermarket chains are enforcing limits on purchases of staples. Thailand has closed schools, bars, cinemas and other entertainment centres. The Philippines, which has 202 cases and 17 deaths, has imposed some of the toughest movement controls, effectively quarantining about half of its 107 million population. But it reversed a decision to ban all international flights, and foreign nationals may now fly out, although arrivals will face strict quarantine protocols. Taiwan will on Thursday ban foreigners from entering, apart from in some exceptional cases. Everyone arriving, including Taiwanese, will have to go into quarantine for 14 days.

"Chancellor Rishi Sunak unveiled a package of financial measures to support the economy on Tuesday As we discussed earlier, the government had to act credibly, and act fast. There is no question that offering to pump more than Â£300bn into the economy to protect it from the worst is a very serious move - the lion's share government backed loans, with around Â£20bn of grants and tax cuts too. You can't question the government's intention tonight to show boldness and to show intent that they will do ""whatever it takes"" (the chancellor and the PM's mantra) not just to support the health of the country, but our livelihoods too. Rarely, but every now and then, there is a day in Westminster when it feels like the landscape has transformed - and this is one of them. Not just because the size of the promises is vast and represents a huge extension of state intervention in the economy; also, it will have massive implications for the taxpayer for years and years to come. One insider whispered to me that the moves could end up with the government essentially supporting every UK business in one way or another, and the national debt ballooning once again. EASY STEPS:How to keep safe A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? TRAVEL PLANS:What are your rights? IN-DEPTH:Coronavirus pandemic Together with sweeping new powersin the government's emergency legislation, which also deserves careful scrutiny, the government is clearly buckling up for a period of profound disruption and change, and that will see ministers' roles become much more central in all of our lives. There are still holes in the vast plans - it's not yet clear what will happen to people who rent their homes rather than have mortgages. Can businesses who are making decisions right now about whether they need to shut up shop possibly get money and support fast enough to stave off the worst? Can families who have lost their sources of income get help quickly so they can pay the bills right now? There is pressure on the ministers to answer these, and many other questions as quickly as they can. But with the government announcing enormous and expensive emergency promises, planes grounded, hospital operations cancelled, even religious worship curtailed, for now, even if on a temporary basis, the UK is changing before our eyes.

The government had been urged to do more for families, workers and tenants affected by coronavirus. Mr Corbyn urged the PM to protect private renters in ""the interests of public health"", adding Britain's 20m private renters were ""worried sick"" about missing payments if they became ill, lost pay or had to self-isolate. MPs practiced the government's social distancing advice in sitting apart during Prime Minister's Questions Mr Johnson said it will bring forward legislation to protect private renters from eviction, but will also avoid ""pass[ing] on the problem"" by ""taking steps to protect other actors in the economy"".

Sainsbury's said it would prioritise elderly and other vulnerable people for online deliveries, as both Sainsbury's and Asda limited people to buying no more than three of any food item. Other retailers including Tesco and Boots have set limits on particularly popular products including pasta, tissues and hand sanitiser. Meanwhile, lorry drivers transporting essential goods to supermarkets will be allowed to stay on the road longer without a break after Transport Secretary Grant Shapps temporarily relaxed the rules. In entertainment, EastEnders will be broadcast just twice a week - rather than four times -as the BBC postponed filmingof the soap opera and other dramas ""until further notice"" AndGlastonbury Festival has been postponedfrom June 2020 until 2021, its organisers said.

Elsewhere, car manufacturers were among the latest companies to be affected, withToyota and BMW both suspending production at their UK factories. Toyota employs more than 3,200 people in the UK, while BMW has 6,000 manufacturing staff. This video can not be played Boris Johnson: ""We must act like any wartime government"" Unveiling the financial measures at a press conference on Tuesday, Chancellor Rishi Sunak said the Â£330bn in loans - equivalent to 15% of GDP - would be available from next week to help businesses pay for supplies, rent and salaries. Analysis: Holes remain in bold virus plans Virus-hit tenants 'should get a rent break' Sainsbury's takes steps to help elderly shoppers Rachel Reeves, Labour chairwoman of the Commons Business Committee, said there was nothing in the chancellor's announcement to offer financial support to people who were already on statutory sick pay, self-isolating or had been laid off. And unions raised concerns there were no measures to help freelancers and people working in the gig economy. The additional measures came after the publicwere told to avoid all non-essential contact and travel. By next weekend, those with the most serious health conditions must be ""largely shielded from social contact for around 12 weeks"", under thelatest government guidance,external. Some doctors have called for more testing for the virus among NHS workers to prevent any unnecessary absences. Speaking at PMQs, Mr Johnson said testing for the virus is to be ramped up to 25,000 tests a day, following criticism too few were being carried out. The testing will be more than doubled in England, after a prior government commitment to boost tests from 2,000 to 10,000 a day. Commercial equipment will be brought in to boost the capacity currently available in the NHS and via Public Health England. Mr Johnson also confirmed that the UK is getting ""much closer"" to having a generally available test to determine whether someone has had coronavirus. He added the government is making a ""massive effort"" to ensure healthcare staff have enough protective equipment to wear while treating patients. Leading scientists at Porton Down, the Ministry of Defence's highly secure research laboratory in Wiltshire, have been called in to help deal with the spread of coronavirus, the BBC has been told. A team of about 10 defence scientists are working with public health officials to analyse the spread of the virus and to help with testing. The number of people who have died with the virus in the UK reached 71 on Tuesday,after a second death was confirmed in Scotland, as well asa second in Walesand a further 14 in England. A man in his 40s with motor neurone disease (MND) is thought tobe the youngest person in the UK to have died having tested positive for coronavirus. Craig Ruston, understood to be 45, died in Kettering, Northamptonshire, on Monday morning and his chest infection was diagnosed as Covid-19. The government's chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance said it would be a ""good outcome"" for the UK if the number of deaths from the virus could be kept below 20,000. Some 2,626 people have tested positive for the virus in the UK, according to the latest Department of Health figures - but the actual number of cases could be as high as 55,000. As of 9am on Wednesday, a total of 56,221 people have been tested, 53,595 of whom have come back as negative. Among the latest confirmed cases is a newborn baby at James Paget hospital in Norfolk.

"Social care firms help older and disabled people to live in their own homes Coronavirus has left companies which support older and disabled people in their own homes struggling to cope, says their professional association. The UK Home Care Association says the firms need more protective equipment for staff and clearer guidance on protecting clients. The virus has put care companies which were already financially vulnerable under additional pressure, says UKHCA. A Â£350bn package to support businesses ""small and large"" has been announced. In a statement on Tuesday,Chancellor Rishi Sunak vowed to do ""whatever it takes""to help the economy and support businesses ""to get through this"". The extra demands placed on care at home by the coronavirus outbreak have thrown the underlying social care crisis into sharp relief, UKHCA argues. In the current situation, home care companies say they are likely to have more people needing care and will need to train extra staff as some will not be able to work if they become ill. Tuesday's announcement by NHS England that hospitals should free up some 15,000 beds by discharging long-term patients who are medically fit into the community is expected to pile even more pressure onto the social care sector in the coming weeks. EASY STEPS:How to keep safe A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? TRAVEL PLANS:What are your rights? IN-DEPTH:Coronavirus pandemic The UKHCA says social care companies not only urgently need extra financial support from government but also changes to the way they are paid by local authorities, so they ""don't run out of money"". The association's chief executive Dr Jane Townson said: ""We are desperately worried about the ability of care providers to remain solvent, whilst paying unprecedented numbers of careworkers who are sick or self-isolating. ""Councils and the NHS only pay for care delivered. They will not pay for careworkers who are prevented from working.  People who buy their own homecare will not be able to bear the additional cost of staff absence."" The association represents more than 2,000 care providers, from private firms to not-for-profit organisations, many of which are already under financial pressure across the UK after a long-standing failure by governments to reform or fund the council-run system properly. The crisis in care: Who pays? The issue of social care in 10 charts Stop cuts to adult social care, petition urges Local authorities buy most of the care for people in their own homes and at the end of each month, the number of minutes of support provided by care staff is totted up and the firm is paid for that in arrears. The UKHCA wants councils to pay companies upfront, based on the average amount of care they have provided in previous months, with the final figures worked out later. On the subject of personal protective equipment, Sir Simon Stevens, chief executive of NHS England, has told MPs that there is enough of it but there have been problems getting supplies to the right places. ""Let's be clear, this is a challenge facing every country,"" Sir Simon told the Commons health and social care committee. ""A lot of the Chinese supply for some of the more basic items has been disrupted. ""So, we are going to have to ramp up the production of gowns, in particular, and some of the face masks, given this is not a flash in the panâ¦ we are going to have to ramp up domestic production of those items as well.""

"Heptathlete Johnson-Thompson (left) and pole vault champion Stefanidi have expressed concerns The International Olympic Committee says it has held ""constructive"" talks with athlete representatives about the coronavirus crisis. President Thomas Bach admitted he was ""confronted with many questions"" over qualification and restrictions. But he also insisted that ""everybody realised that we still have more than four months to go"" until Tokyo 2020. The summer showpiece is still scheduled to begin on 24 July despite the cancellation of other sports events. There has been mounting criticism from athletes, with the IOC accused of putting them ""in danger"" by insisting it remains fully committed to the Games. Olympic champion Katerina Stefanidi said the IOC was ""risking our health"", while Britain's Katarina Johnson-Thompson said training had become ""impossible"". Speaking in an in-house IOC interview, Bach said: ""We have just had a really great call with 220 athlete representatives from all around the world, it was very constructive and gave us a lot of insight. ""We aimed to continue being very realistic in our analysis. We will keep acting in a responsible way that is in the interest of the athletes whilst always respecting our two principles - the safeguarding and health of the athletes and contributing to the containment of the virus, and secondly to protect the interest of the athletes and Olympic sport."" British four-time Olympic rowing gold medallist Matthew Pinsent criticised Bach's comments onTwitter,,externalaccusing him of not properly listening to athletes' concerns and stating that postponing the Olympics is the best option for all concerned. ""I'm sorry Mr Bach but this is tone deaf. The instinct to keep safe is not compatible with athlete training, travel and focus that a looming Olympics demands of athletes, spectators and organisers,"" Pinsent wrote. ""Keep them safe. Call it off."" Earlier, in a statement, the IOC had warned ""no solution will be ideal"" in preparing for Tokyo 2020. ""This is an exceptional situation which requires exceptional solutions,"" it said. ""The IOC is committed to finding a solution with the least negative impact for the athletes, while protecting the integrity of the competition and the athletes' health. ""No solution will be ideal in this situation, and this is why we are counting on the responsibility and solidarity of the athletes."" Johnson-Thompson shared this image with the caption ""10 minutes left on these streets before France goes into complete lockdown"" World heptathlon champion Johnson-Thompson, 27, is returning to the UK from her training base in France as a result of the countrybeing in lockdown. Tokyo 2020 organisers have pledged todeliver a ""complete"" Gamesbut Johnson-Thompson said current guidance from the International Olympic Committee (IOC) is confusing. She said: ""The IOC advice 'encourages athletes to continue to prepare for the Olympic Games as best as they can' with the Olympics only four months away but the government legislation is enforcing isolation at home, with tracks, gyms and public spaces closed. ""I feel under pressure to train and keep the same routine, which is impossible. ""I'm in a very fortunate place given the circumstances. I'm healthy, well supported and I have already qualified for the Olympics. But at this moment it's difficult to approach the season when everything has changed in the lead up apart from the ultimate deadline."" All club training sessions, events, competitions, club committee and face-to-face meetings, athlete camps, running groups and social events have been suspended across England, Scotland and Wales. Several athletes have joined Johnson-Thompson in pointing to confusion on how they should prepare. British race walker Tom Bosworth told BBC Sport: ""I don't think there is enough time to properly build towards a games, whether that is build athlete profiles, build the teams, allow people to qualify who haven't qualified and celebrate an Olympic Games in an Olympic year as it should be. ""I think for all involved, a slight delay is probably the best option."" Stefanidi, who won gold for Greece in pole vault at Rio 2016, said: ""This is not about how things will be in four months. This is about how things are now. ""The IOC wants us to keep risking our health, our family's health and public health to train every day? You are putting us in danger right now, today, not in four months."" Hayley Wickenheiser, a member of the IOC, has said the Olympic governing body's decision to""move ahead, with such conviction, is insensitive and irresponsible given the state of humanity."" Spanish Olympic Committee (COE) president Alejandro Blanco has told Reuters he wouldprefer this year's Games be postponed.,external About 57% of the athletes set to attend the Games have so far qualified. On Tuesday, the IOC asked athletes to continue preparations ""as best they can"". Jessica Judd, who represented Britain over 5,000m at the 2019 World Championships, tweeted: ""How on earth are we meant to carry on preparing best we can? ""Will someone share with me what races we can do to get times and whether trials will go ahead and when training can return to normal?""

"New York's Mayor Bill de Blasio may order the city's 8.5 million residents to ""shelter in place"" The deadly coronavirus has now hit all 50 states in the US as West Virginia reported its first case of the infection on Tuesday. Announcing West Virginia's first Covid-19 patient, Governor Jim Justice said: ""We knew this was coming."" There have so far been 108 deaths in the US from coronavirus and more than 6,300 confirmed cases nationwide. Globally, there are about 200,000 cases and nearly 8,000 people have died. Will US be ready in the weeks ahead? Why US testing failed - and can it catch up now? As the Trump administration seeks a$1tn economic stimulus package, US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin reportedly warned Republican senators privately on Tuesday evening that if Congress failed to act, US unemployment could hit 20% - almost double the jobless rate during the Great Recession after the 2008 financial crisis. Mayor Bill de Blasio said he would decide within two days whether to order the city's 8.5 million residents to ""shelter in place"". Such a move could largely confine people to their homes, while allowing them to make necessary trips to buy groceries or medicine, walk a dog or exercise as long as they avoid public interaction. ""It's a very, very difficult decision,"" Mr de Blasio said. ""We've never been here before. I have never heard of anything like this in the history of New York City."" However, New York state's governor Andrew Cuomo has suggested he would reject such a plan. Officials in the San Francisco Bay area have already ordered 6.7 million residents to stay home for all but the most crucial outings until 7 April.

US Vice-President Mike Pence said the White House may call on the US military to establish field hospitals in virus hot spots if requested by state governors. He told a White House news conference on Tuesday that the Army Corps of Engineers could be asked to set up field hospitals, known as Mash (mobile army surgical hospital) units, or help expand existing hospitals. Pentagon chief Mark Esper said the US military would make available five million respirator masks and up to 2,000 ventilators to the US health department. He said the military would also open its 14 certified coronavirus labs to test non-military personnel. Why US could be more at risk from coronavirus Kind Canadians start 'caremongering' trend Washington DC officials have ordered the temporary closure of all bars - The Dubliner pub near Capitol Hill was empty on St Patrick's Day On Tuesday, Florida joined 11 other states in closing bars and restaurants in one of the most subdued St Patrick's Day celebrations the US has marked in peacetime. Organisers of the Kentucky Derby - America's longest continuously held sports event - postponed the horse race until September. It was the latest rite of spring to fall from the calendar because of the coronavirus, along with the Masters golf tournament, the March Madness basketball extravaganza and baseball season. The country's largest enclosed shopping centre, the Mall of America in Minnesota, said it would close until the end of the month. Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies were ordered to make fewer arrests to avoid jail crowding where the virus could spread. Twenty-two people were infected with the respiratory illness at a nursing home in suburban Chicago. Meanwhile, the US and Canada are reportedly finalising an agreement to suspend non-essential travel between the two countries and are expected to issue a statement in the coming days.

Trump angers Beijing with 'Chinese virus' tweet He also defended his tweet on Monday calling the infection the ""Chinese virus"", which his critics said was racist. ""It did come from China,"" he told reporters. Mr Trump also said on Tuesday of the outbreak: ""I've felt that it was a pandemic long before it was called a pandemic.""

"This video can not be played Joe Biden addresses Bernie Sanders' supporters: ""I hear you... I know what we have to do"" Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden has steamrolled rival Bernie Sanders in primary elections in Florida, Illinois and Arizona. Accelerating his momentum in the race, the former US vice-president made a clean sweep in all three states. Mr Biden appealed for support directly to Sanders supporters. With his hat-trick, Mr Biden took another big stride towards becoming the Democratic candidate who will face President Donald Trump in November. Mr Biden won a smashing victory over Mr Sanders in Florida, the biggest prize of the night with 219 delegates. The former vice-president won 62% of the vote and about 130 delegates. Mr Sanders, with only 23%, took some 48 delegates, with the rest still to be distributed. Mr Trump won that traditional battleground state by 1.2 percentage points in the 2016 presidential election. In Illinois, with most precincts reporting, Mr Biden led the Vermont senator by 59% to 36%. With most votes counted in Arizona, Mr Biden has a double-digit lead over Mr Sanders in the south-western state. A Democratic candidate needs 1,991 delegates to clinch the nomination. Will Joe Biden's record come back to haunt him? On the eve of Tuesday's vote, Mr Biden was hoping to build on his victories in 16 of the last 21 state contests. The former US vice-president's triumph last month in South Carolina - his first ever primary win over three campaigns for president - resuscitated his faltering campaign. According to opinion polling, most voters said electability was a priority for them. About three in four Florida voters said Mr Biden would have a better chance of beating Mr Trump, a Republican. Just one in five said the same of Mr Sanders. Older voters were more likely to say they supported Mr Biden. Nearly half of Florida's voters said Mr Sanders' stances were too liberal. This video can not be played What unites these two bitter rivals? In a webcam speech from his home in Wilmington, Delaware, to comply with US anti-coronavirus advice against public gatherings, Mr Biden appealed to Mr Sanders' passionate supporters. He said: ""Let me say, especially to the young voters who have been inspired by Senator Sanders, I hear you, I know what's at stake, I know what we have to do."" But he focused largely on the outbreak sweeping the US, striking a unifying tone as he said: ""The coronavirus doesn't care if you're a Democrat or a Republican... we're all in this together."" Mr Sanders hosted an online address from Washington DC, but he did not drop any hints about the future of his campaign. He instead talked about the coronavirus crisis, outlining proposals to address the pandemic, which he said would cost some $2tn. Eighteen things Bernie Sanders believes How much does Sanders want to spend? This video can not be played Biden will have to win over young voters like Alexis and Amira. Democrats in three states have just cemented the presidential nomination for Joe Biden. Bernie Sanders was soundly defeated in Illinois and Arizona and routed in Florida, where in one county he finished third behind Michael Bloomberg, who dropped out weeks ago. He will fall even further behind in the national convention delegate count, as the primary season appears to be heading towards suspended animation, with multiple states delaying their contests until June. Mr Sanders should have a long think about how long he wants to stay in this fight, even if he does have more than enough financial resources to carry on. He is going to face growing calls from Democrats to gracefully bow out - something he did not do until the eve of the convention four years ago, much to the consternation of many Hillary Clinton supporters. The bottom line for Mr Sanders may be evaluating what's best for the movement he created. Will staying in the race give him a continuing platform to talk about his issues and buy him time for a potential comeback? Or will hanging around only increase the chances that he is relegated to an electoral afterthought? Read Anthony's full takeaways Also on Tuesday night, the US president officially clinched the Republican party nomination with a win in the Illinois primary. His victory had been a foregone conclusion in a contest where he has faced only nominal opposition from a former Massachusetts Governor, Bill Weld. Illinois' delegates drove Mr Trump over the 1,276-delegate threshold required to become the party's standard-bearer. Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel congratulated the president on Twitter for ""officially becoming the presumptive Republican nominee"". This video can not be played Biden curses Michigan voter who said he's taking Americans' guns. Ohio was also due to hold a primary on Tuesday, but it cancelled the vote hours before polls were due to open, putting it off till June. Voters in the three states that did head to polling stations on Tuesday encountered hand sanitiser dispensers and workers in surgical gloves. Several other states have postponed their Democratic presidential primaries, including Georgia, Louisiana, Maryland and Kentucky. Coronavirus-wary voters cast their ballots in Florida The Democratic National Committee blasted Ohio for sowing ""chaos and confusion"" and urged remaining primary states not to follow suit. But Puerto Rico, which is scheduled to hold the next Democratic primary on 29 March, is also planning to reschedule. Party grandees are encouraging states and territories instead to extend postal and early voting to reduce public exposure to the virus. On Tuesday, the US Secret Service said it would this week begin providing full protection for Mr Biden. His codename will be Celtic, the same as when he was vice-president. Mr Biden requested the security detail after being repeatedly accosted by protesters on the campaign trail. Two protesters rushed a stage in Los Angeles earlier this month and came within a stride of the candidate as he gave a victory speech. Mr Sanders has not made a request for Secret Service protection.

Johnson-Thompson shared this image with the caption ""10 minutes left on these streets before France goes into complete lockdown"" World heptathlon champion Johnson-Thompson, 27, is returning to the UK from her training base in France as a result of the countrybeing in lockdown. Tokyo 2020 organisers have pledged todeliver a ""complete"" Gamesbut Johnson-Thompson said current guidance from the International Olympic Committee (IOC) is confusing. She said: ""The IOC advice 'encourages athletes to continue to prepare for the Olympic Games as best as they can' with the Olympics only four months away but the government legislation is enforcing isolation at home, with tracks, gyms and public spaces closed. ""I feel under pressure to train and keep the same routine, which is impossible. ""I'm in a very fortunate place given the circumstances. I'm healthy, well supported and I have already qualified for the Olympics. But at this moment it's difficult to approach the season when everything has changed in the lead up apart from the ultimate deadline."" All club training sessions, events, competitions, club committee and face-to-face meetings, athlete camps, running groups and social events have been suspended across England, Scotland and Wales. Several athletes have joined Johnson-Thompson in pointing to confusion on how they should prepare. British race walker Tom Bosworth told BBC Sport: ""I don't think there is enough time to properly build towards a games, whether that is build athlete profiles, build the teams, allow people to qualify who haven't qualified and celebrate an Olympic Games in an Olympic year as it should be. ""I think for all involved, a slight delay is probably the best option."" Stefanidi, who won gold for Greece in pole vault at Rio 2016, said: ""This is not about how things will be in four months. This is about how things are now. ""The IOC wants us to keep risking our health, our family's health and public health to train every day? You are putting us in danger right now, today, not in four months."" Hayley Wickenheiser, a member of the IOC, has said the Olympic governing body's decision to""move ahead, with such conviction, is insensitive and irresponsible given the state of humanity."" Spanish Olympic Committee (COE) president Alejandro Blanco has told Reuters he wouldprefer this year's Games be postponed.,external About 57% of the athletes set to attend the Games have so far qualified. On Tuesday, the IOC asked athletes to continue preparations ""as best they can"". Jessica Judd, who represented Britain over 5,000m at the 2019 World Championships, tweeted: ""How on earth are we meant to carry on preparing best we can? ""Will someone share with me what races we can do to get times and whether trials will go ahead and when training can return to normal?""

"Social care firms help older and disabled people to live in their own homes Coronavirus has left companies which support older and disabled people in their own homes struggling to cope, says their professional association. The UK Home Care Association says the firms need more protective equipment for staff and clearer guidance on protecting clients. The virus has put care companies which were already financially vulnerable under additional pressure, says UKHCA. A Â£350bn package to support businesses ""small and large"" has been announced. In a statement on Tuesday,Chancellor Rishi Sunak vowed to do ""whatever it takes""to help the economy and support businesses ""to get through this"". The extra demands placed on care at home by the coronavirus outbreak have thrown the underlying social care crisis into sharp relief, UKHCA argues. In the current situation, home care companies say they are likely to have more people needing care and will need to train extra staff as some will not be able to work if they become ill. Tuesday's announcement by NHS England that hospitals should free up some 15,000 beds by discharging long-term patients who are medically fit into the community is expected to pile even more pressure onto the social care sector in the coming weeks. EASY STEPS:How to keep safe A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? TRAVEL PLANS:What are your rights? IN-DEPTH:Coronavirus pandemic The UKHCA says social care companies not only urgently need extra financial support from government but also changes to the way they are paid by local authorities, so they ""don't run out of money"". The association's chief executive Dr Jane Townson said: ""We are desperately worried about the ability of care providers to remain solvent, whilst paying unprecedented numbers of careworkers who are sick or self-isolating. ""Councils and the NHS only pay for care delivered. They will not pay for careworkers who are prevented from working.  People who buy their own homecare will not be able to bear the additional cost of staff absence."" The association represents more than 2,000 care providers, from private firms to not-for-profit organisations, many of which are already under financial pressure across the UK after a long-standing failure by governments to reform or fund the council-run system properly. The crisis in care: Who pays? The issue of social care in 10 charts Stop cuts to adult social care, petition urges Local authorities buy most of the care for people in their own homes and at the end of each month, the number of minutes of support provided by care staff is totted up and the firm is paid for that in arrears. The UKHCA wants councils to pay companies upfront, based on the average amount of care they have provided in previous months, with the final figures worked out later. On the subject of personal protective equipment, Sir Simon Stevens, chief executive of NHS England, has told MPs that there is enough of it but there have been problems getting supplies to the right places. ""Let's be clear, this is a challenge facing every country,"" Sir Simon told the Commons health and social care committee. ""A lot of the Chinese supply for some of the more basic items has been disrupted. ""So, we are going to have to ramp up the production of gowns, in particular, and some of the face masks, given this is not a flash in the panâ¦ we are going to have to ramp up domestic production of those items as well.""

"Online shopping delivery service Ocado has suspended its online food delivery service, blaming higher demand than it can meet. Ocado said existing customers with orders would still receive them. Meanwhile, supermarkets have introduced strict limits on how many goods people can buy to try to curb stockpiling as the coronavirus pandemic escalates. Tesco, Sainsbury's and Asda will now stop shoppers buying more than three of any particular food item. Sainsbury's has also said it will prioritise vulnerable and elderly people for online deliveries. Ocado said it was experiencing ""a simply staggering amount of traffic"" to its website and more demand for products and deliveries than it could meet. ""This temporary closure will allow us to complete essential work that will help to make sure distribution of products and delivery slots is as fair and accessible as possible for all our loyal customers,"" it added. Asda and Sainsbury's buying restrictions will also apply to cleaning and toiletry products, while Tesco's limits will apply to all products. ""If you could help us by limiting demand of essential items and allowing us to focus on the core needs of our customers - we are confident that we can continue to feed the nation,"" said Tesco. Business Live: Boots boss says there's enough paracetamol What are shops doing about stockpiling? Iceland stores introduce elderly shopping hour Asda said it had seen ""a heightened demand"" for products both in stores and online. ""We have plenty of products to go around, but we have a responsibility to do the right thing for our communities to help our customers look after their loved ones in a time of need,"" it added. Asda told the BBC that cashiers and customers using self-checkout would not be able to scan more than three of the same restricted items. Sainsbury's said it was updating its tills to reflect the limits. Aldi has already introduced limits of four items per shopper on all products, while Morrisons has said it will expand its online delivery service. Consumers left shelves empty in one London Sainsbury's store as stockpiling continues Other retailers including Tesco and Boots have set limits on particularly popular products such as pasta, tissues and hand sanitiser. Boots chief executive Sebastian James said the issue was not supply, but demand. ""No supply chain can survive a sudden, unexpected global ten-fold increase in demand. And what we thought was incredibly important was that as many people as possible could get what they actually needed,"" he told the BBC's Today programme. Supermarkets' online delivery services have also been overwhelmed by the surge in demand. Before Ocado suspended its whole service it had taken down its app due to the spike in orders. Others meanwhile vented their frustration on Twitter at being one of thousands in a virtual queue to place a food order. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Supermarket chain Sainsbury's already had a two-item limit on its most popular goods, including toilet paper, soap and long-life milk. From 23 March, it said disabled customers and those over 70 will be given priority for online delivery slots. And on 19 March the first hour of shopping will be dedicated to older and vulnerable people in its 600 UK stores. The chain follows other supermarkets in introducing reserved time slots for the elderly. They include Iceland outlets across the country and all 39 Lidl stores in Northern Ireland. Sainsbury's told the BBC that it would consider future dedicated shopping hours ""in line with government guidance"", after the one-off on Thursday. Shoppers have been emptying shelves around the UK during the coronavirus outbreak Sainsbury's chief executive Mike Coupe added it was ""focusing all of our efforts on getting as much food and other essential items from our suppliers, into our warehouses and onto shelves as we possibly can. ""We still have enough food for everyone - if we all just buy what we need for us and our families."" Mr Coupe confirmed that it was closing its cafes as well as its fish, pizza and meat counters to free up more staff to work on ""keeping the shelves as well stocked as possible."" Asda will also temporarily shut down its ""non-essential"" services including its rotisserie and pizza counters to free up its workers and space in its warehouses.

In its preliminary results for the week ending 2 February, its chief executive David Potts said retailers were ""facing unprecedented challenges"" when dealing with Covid-19.

"This video can not be played Rishi Sunak: ""We have never in peacetime faced an economic fight like this one"" Chancellor Rishi Sunak has unveiled an ""unprecedented"" set of financial measures to support the UK economy through the coronavirus pandemic. They include mortgage ""holidays"" for those in financial difficulty as well as Â£330bn in loans and Â£20bn in other aid to protect businesses facing losses as a result of the virus. Meanwhile all non-urgent operations in England and Scotland will be postponed to free up beds for virus patients. It comes as the UK death toll hit 71. The government's chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance said it would be a ""good outcome"" for the UK if the number of deaths from the virus could be kept below 20,000. ""Never in peacetime have we faced an economic fight like this one,"" Mr Sunak said at a Downing Street press conference, as hedetailed measures to ease financial burdenscaused by the virus. The chancellor said the Â£330bn in loans - equivalent to 15% of GDP - would be available from next week to help businesses pay for supplies, rent and salaries. Other measures to be put in place include extended business rates relief and a three-month mortgage holiday for people in financial difficulty as a result of the virus. ""We must act like any wartime government and do whatever it takes to support our economy,"" Prime Minister Boris Johnson said at the same conference. Labour's shadow chancellor John McDonnell said there was nothing in the statement to protect renters - although Mr Sunak said measures would be announced in the ""coming days"". Mr McDonnell also called for statutory sick pay to be increased and for those losing their jobs to be given some support. And unions raised concern that no measures were announced to help freelancers and people working in the so-called gig economy, This video can not be played Boris Johnson: ""We must act like any wartime government"" NHS England's chief executive Sir Simon Stevens said postponing routine surgery from 15 April would help to expand critical care capacity to the maximum - to prepare for ""the likely influx of more coronavirus patients"". The emergency policy to free up 30,000 beds will be in place for at least three months, he said. However, cancer operations will continue to go ahead, Sir Simon added. Sir Simon said the health system in England has about 7,000 ventilators and there are plans to increase this to 12,000. British engineering firmshave been called on to switch to making medical ventilatorsto help efforts to cope with the virus, which causes the disease Covid-19.

He also advised people taking painkillers to use paracetamol instead of ibuprofen, after French health officials indicated anti-inflammatory drugs could worsen the virus - a suggestion Sir Patrick said ""may or may not be right"". Coronavirus and ibuprofen: Fact vs fiction BBC news online health editor Michelle Roberts said up to 15,000 of England's 100,000 hospital beds could be freed up for coronavirus admissions by discharging other patients who are well enough to go home or be cared for in the community. She added that Sir Simon would not say whether the measures will ultimately be enough to ease the pressure on the NHS. Scottish Health Secretary Jeane Freeman said emergency measures by the NHS in Scotland would also include doubling the number of intensive care beds. The number of people who have died with the virus in the UK has reached 71,after a second death was confirmed in Scotland, as well asa second in Wales.and a further 14 in England. Some 1,950 people have tested positive for the virus in the UK,according to the latest Department of Health figures,external- but the actual number of cases could be as high as 55,000. Sir Patrick told the health select committee that a death rate of one fatality for every 1,000 cases was a ""reasonable ballpark"" figure, based on scientific modelling. More than 50,000 people have been tested for the virus in the UK, but the government is primarily testing people who are in hospital. This means many people who have mild symptoms may never be diagnosed with the virus. This video can not be played Dominic Raab: ""I have taken the decision to advise British national against international travel, globally"" Earlier the Foreign Office advised British nationals to avoid all non-essential foreign travel. The restrictions will be in place for 30 days initially but could be extended, the Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab told the House of Commons. It is the first time the UK has advised against foreign travel anywhere in the world. ""UK travellers abroad now face widespread international border restrictions and lockdowns in various countries,"" Mr Raab said in a statement.

But the Foreign Office said travellers should bear in mind that flights could be cancelled at short notice as foreign countries grapple with restrictions being imposed by their own authorities. The foreign secretary added the government would issue advice on how the flow of food and goods to the UK can be maintained, and that staff working on shipping routes should continue to do so as their travel was ""essential"". The travel advice for British nationals has in part been brought in because of the stringent social distancing measuresannounced by Boris Johnson on Monday. This video can not be played Boris Johnson: ""It look as though we are now approaching the fast growth part of the upward curve"" Thekey new measures,externalthe prime minister announced included: Everyone should avoid gatherings with friends and family, as well as large gatherings and crowded places, such as pubs, clubs and theatres People should avoid non-essential travel and work from home if they can All ""unnecessary"" visits to friends and relatives in care homes should cease People should only use the NHS ""where we really need to"" - and can reduce the burden on workers by gettingadvice on the NHS website,externalwhere possible By next weekend, those with the most serious health conditions must be ""largely shielded from social contact for around 12 weeks"" If one person in any household has a persistent cough or fever, everyone living there must stay at home for 14 days Those people should, if possible, avoid leaving the house ""even to buy food or essentials"" - but they may leave the house ""for exercise and, in that case, at a safe distance from others"" While schools will not be closed for the moment, a union leader has describedthe ""intolerable pressure"" teachers are underas a result of the lack of clarity about pupil and staff safety. Sir Patrick said closing schools remained an option to help curb the spread of the virus but would cause an ""enormous problem"" for the workforce. He told MPs such an intervention could have ""all sorts of complicated effects"" such as that children off school might have to be looked after by elderly grandparents.

"This video can not be played Boris Johnson confirms the government will bring forward legislation âto protect private renters from evictionâ. The government will bring forward emergency legislation to protect private renters from eviction, Boris Johnson has said. Tenants were ""worried sick"" they might not be able to pay rents if they fell ill, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said at Prime Minister's Questions. As Wales and Scotland said they would close schools by Friday Mr Johnson said a decision on England was imminent. It came after Chancellor Rishi Sunak announced Â£350bn of help for companies. On Tuesday, the chancellor promised mortgage ""holidays"", Â£330bn in loans and Â£20bn in other aid. The government had been urged to do more for families, workers and tenants affected by coronavirus. Mr Corbyn urged the PM to protect private renters in ""the interests of public health"", adding Britain's 20m private renters were ""worried sick"" about missing payments if they became ill, lost pay or had to self-isolate. MPs practiced the government's social distancing advice in sitting apart during Prime Minister's Questions Mr Johnson said it will bring forward legislation to protect private renters from eviction, but will also avoid ""pass[ing] on the problem"" by ""taking steps to protect other actors in the economy"". Housing associations will not evict tenants who are affected by the virus and fall behind on rent payments, Kate Henderson, of the National Housing Federation, which represents housing associations in England, has confirmed. This video can not be played Rishi Sunak: ""We have never in peacetime faced an economic fight like this one"" Paying tribute to the efforts of teachers, and school staff, Mr Johnson said he wanted to do more to ""remove burdens on schools"". He added: ""The House should expect further decisions to be taken imminently on schools and how to be sure we square the circle, making sure we stop spread of the disease but relieve pressure on the NHS."" Meanwhile,all schools in Wales will close by Fridayat the latest in response to the coronavirus outbreak, the Welsh Government has announced. Scotland's schools and nurseries will close from the end of this weekand may not reopen before the summer, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has said. It comes as: The total number of positive cases in the UK has risen to2,626, up from 1,950 on Tuesday,,externalaccording to government figures.

Sainsbury's said it would prioritise elderly and other vulnerable people for online deliveries, as both Sainsbury's and Asda limited people to buying no more than three of any food item. Other retailers including Tesco and Boots have set limits on particularly popular products including pasta, tissues and hand sanitiser. Meanwhile, lorry drivers transporting essential goods to supermarkets will be allowed to stay on the road longer without a break after Transport Secretary Grant Shapps temporarily relaxed the rules.

And unions raised concerns there were no measures to help freelancers and people working in the gig economy. The additional measures came after the publicwere told to avoid all non-essential contact and travel. By next weekend, those with the most serious health conditions must be ""largely shielded from social contact for around 12 weeks"", under thelatest government guidance,external. Some doctors have called for more testing for the virus among NHS workers to prevent any unnecessary absences. Speaking at PMQs, Mr Johnson said testing for the virus is to be ramped up to 25,000 tests a day, following criticism too few were being carried out. The testing will be more than doubled in England, after a prior government commitment to boost tests from 2,000 to 10,000 a day. Commercial equipment will be brought in to boost the capacity currently available in the NHS and via Public Health England. Mr Johnson also confirmed that the UK is getting ""much closer"" to having a generally available test to determine whether someone has had coronavirus. He added the government is making a ""massive effort"" to ensure healthcare staff have enough protective equipment to wear while treating patients. Leading scientists at Porton Down, the Ministry of Defence's highly secure research laboratory in Wiltshire, have been called in to help deal with the spread of coronavirus, the BBC has been told. A team of about 10 defence scientists are working with public health officials to analyse the spread of the virus and to help with testing. The number of people who have died with the virus in the UK reached 71 on Tuesday,after a second death was confirmed in Scotland, as well asa second in Walesand a further 14 in England. A man in his 40s with motor neurone disease (MND) is thought tobe the youngest person in the UK to have died having tested positive for coronavirus. Craig Ruston, understood to be 45, died in Kettering, Northamptonshire, on Monday morning and his chest infection was diagnosed as Covid-19. The government's chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance said it would be a ""good outcome"" for the UK if the number of deaths from the virus could be kept below 20,000. Some 2,626 people have tested positive for the virus in the UK, according to the latest Department of Health figures - but the actual number of cases could be as high as 55,000. As of 9am on Wednesday, a total of 56,221 people have been tested, 53,595 of whom have come back as negative. Among the latest confirmed cases is a newborn baby at James Paget hospital in Norfolk.

We're pausing our live coverage of the coronavirus pandemic for now but we'll continue to bring you updates across the BBC News website until our teams in Asia pick things up. So for now, here are the latest headlines: We leave you withthis piece that explains two conceptsthat many millions will need to familiarise themselves with: social distancing and self-isolation. And, as always,you can find all of our latest coronavirus stories here. As it stands, the World Health Organisation has confirmed more than 205,000 coronavirus cases worldwide, with the pandemic now affecting over 170 countries. There are many sources for tracking cases, some more reliable than others. Here is a round-up of confirmed cases in 10 the world's hardest-hit countries. We have sourced the figures either from the ongoing tally of cases by Johns Hopkins University or directly from health authorities.  Tasmania, south of the Australian mainland, has announced a state of emergency and a mandatory quarantine on arrivals to prevent the spread of the virus. This includes other Australians and locals heading home from the mainland. The only exceptions are for health and trade workers. The nation's smallest state currently has 10 cases, while there are around 270 in New South Wales and 150 in Victoria - states which have 15 times larger populations. State premier Peter Gutwein says these are the ""toughest border measures in the country"". UK medical staff say they are being put at risk during the coronavirus outbreak because of a lack of protective gear. One NHS doctor told the BBC that frontline healthcare workers felt like ""cannon fodder"" due to inadequate supplies of vital equipment such as face masks. Dr Frances Mair told Newsnight her GP practice in Scotland and ""many others"" did not have the personal protective equipment needed ""to keep us safe"". ""It's very disheartening when you hear of colleagues talking about the way that they feel they are like cannon fodder, sent out to die."" Dr Nishant Joshi, who works in A&E at Luton and Dunstable general hospital, said staff were at ""grave risk"". ""We're fighting an invisible enemy, blindfolded, with both hands tied behind our backs,"" he told Radio 5 Live's Emma Barnett. Earlier on Wednesday, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the UK had ""stockpiles"" of equipment ready to be used. Read more here.  Canada's chief public health official, Dr Theresa Tam, says there has been a ""sharp rise"" in cases over the last week that point to community spread of Covid-19. ""A number of provinces have reported cases with no links to travel,"" Dr Tam said. ""Our time to act is now."" There are currently 598 cases confirmed in Canada and eight deaths.  G'day from Australia, where it's Thursday. The nation has now recorded close to 600 cases including six deaths. Authorities are urging social distancing but standing by policies to keep schools, public transport and other ""essential"" services open. Prime Minister Scott Morrison yesterday also instructed Australians to not travel abroad - that's led to an announcement from the national carrier Qantas this morning. The airline, and its sister budget carrier Jetstar are temporarily standing down two-thirds of their 30,000 employees ""to preserve as many jobs as possible longer term"". All international flights will be suspended from late March. Virgin Australia also suspended routes yesterday. Canberra announced a raft of measures on Wednesday,catch up on those key restrictions here. The nation's central bank, the Reserve Bank of Australia is also set to announce more economic drivers today. President Donald Trump has said the US government's housing agency will stop repossessing homes until the end of April. Evictions will be suspended over the same time frame in a moratorium protecting eight million mortgages. Two US Navy hospitals ships will also be sent to help relieve an expected shortage of sick beds. Read more here A sign above a street in Venice reads: ""Everything will be alright."" The dire news from Italy is that despite a lockdown that has been in place for 10 days across the country, the death toll from this virus has continued to rise and rise. It increased by 475 on Wednesday, the biggest in one day since the outbreak began, with 319 of these deaths occuring in the northern region of Lombardy, which has been the worst-affected. Italian doctors had hoped to see infections slowing after a week of lockdown but that hasn't happened. Some say that only after two weeks - believed to be the maximum time period it takes for symptoms to show - will they truly be able to see if the virus's spread has been slowed by the drastic measures taken. The governor of Lombardy has appealed to the public to continue to stay at home and not flout the government's orders. ""Soon we will no longer be in a position to assist those who are sick,"" Attilio Fontana said earlier today. ""We are asking you to make a sacrifice to save lives.""   The number of confirmed cases in Ireland has risen by 74, bringing the total number to 366, the Department of Health has said. The cases are made up of 29 females and 45 males, it added. On Tuesday, PM Leo Varadkar said Ireland could have 15,000 cases of coronavirus before the end of March. In a St Patrick's Day address, he warned of ""significant and lasting"" economic damage and said the emergency could last into the summer. The government has already closed pubs, schools and universities. This video can not be played Coronavirus explained in 60 seconds What actually is the coronavirus? How might it affect you? What can you do to prevent it? The BBC's Laura Foster explains everything you need to know â in just one minute. There's one major question about this pandemic that millions of people will be hoping has a positive answer: will we see a vaccine anytime soon? Well, earlier today, we heard some promising words from the world's leading public health body. The World Health Organization (WHO) hailed an ""incredible achievement"" in the effort to produce a vaccine for the coronavirus. ""The first vaccine trial has begun, just 60 days after the genetic sequence of the coronavirus was shared,"" WHO chief Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told reporters. That trial began in the USat the Kaiser Permanente research facility in Seattle earlier this week. Four patients received the jab, which cannot cause Covid-19 but contains a harmless genetic code copied from the virus. Now for the bad news. Experts warn that it will be many months before it is clear whether this vaccine, or any of the others that are also in research, will work. And even if these initial safety tests go well, it will still take time for any potential vaccine to become available to the public. It means, realistically, one would not be ready until at least the middle of next year. But don't be too disheartened. Scientists around the world are fast-tracking research in an effort to mass produce a safe vaccine as soon as possible. Stephen McGrath, Romania Jim Turnbull decided to donate the sanitiser to his community Jim Turnbull owns a food production facility in the Romanian region of Transylvania and was due to return to the UK on Tuesday but decided to stay on. He has begun using the alcohol by-product from his elderflower gin distillation to make a hand sanitiser followingguidance by the World Health Organization,external. âGiven the crisis we thought to donate it to our local community - where we get our workforce from,â says Mr Turnbull, 68, who lives in the village of Saschiz, which has a population of some 2,000. Romania has so far had 260 confirmed cases of coronavirus but no deaths. However, its rural population, which makes up around 46% of the countryâs 19 million people, is ageing and could be vulnerable. Bars and restaurants have been shut but Bogdan Tanase, head of Romaniaâs Doctors' Alliance, told the BBC Romania was âill-prepared to deal with an epidemicâ. On Wednesday alone, police in France have handed out more than 4,000 fines to people violating government orders to stay at home. Interior Minister Christophe Castaner told local outlet TF1 that the fine has been increased from â¬35 ($38; Â£32), and can be as much as â¬375 to try to dissuade people. Since yesterday, people in France have been banned from going outside except for exercise and essential trips. During a White House briefing today, President Trump was questioned on his repeated use of the term ""Chinese virus"" to describe Covid-19 - a term critics say has contributed to racism against Asian-Americans - as well as why top US athletes have had access to tests when most Americans haven't. ""Perhaps thatâs been the story of life,"" Trump remarked.

But other developments have been reported around the world as the virus continues to spread: Prof Sian Griffiths is asked by BBC One viewers when and how will we know if these social distancing measures are working. She says: ""You can see changes in people's behaviour, but that's not very accurate. ""We will see it by a fall in the number of positive tests, the number going into hospital and sadly by the numbers who have passed away."" There has been a rise today of nearly 700 cases in the UK, and a total of 104 deaths, so BBC medical correspondent Fergus Walsh is asked, what next? ""The key message is we are all in this together,"" he says. ""We have to wash our hands, we have to comply... if we don't and if we don't see the number of cases reduce in three weeks time, what is advisory could become compulsory."" But Prof Griffiths reminds viewers: ""This too will pass."" Victoria in Belfast ""I am furious over the school closures. I am a self-employed mother of twins. I have zero support.

"Chancellor Rishi Sunak unveiled a package of financial measures to support the economy on Tuesday As we discussed earlier, the government had to act credibly, and act fast. There is no question that offering to pump more than Â£300bn into the economy to protect it from the worst is a very serious move - the lion's share government backed loans, with around Â£20bn of grants and tax cuts too. You can't question the government's intention tonight to show boldness and to show intent that they will do ""whatever it takes"" (the chancellor and the PM's mantra) not just to support the health of the country, but our livelihoods too. Rarely, but every now and then, there is a day in Westminster when it feels like the landscape has transformed - and this is one of them. Not just because the size of the promises is vast and represents a huge extension of state intervention in the economy; also, it will have massive implications for the taxpayer for years and years to come. One insider whispered to me that the moves could end up with the government essentially supporting every UK business in one way or another, and the national debt ballooning once again. EASY STEPS:How to keep safe A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? TRAVEL PLANS:What are your rights? IN-DEPTH:Coronavirus pandemic Together with sweeping new powersin the government's emergency legislation, which also deserves careful scrutiny, the government is clearly buckling up for a period of profound disruption and change, and that will see ministers' roles become much more central in all of our lives. There are still holes in the vast plans - it's not yet clear what will happen to people who rent their homes rather than have mortgages. Can businesses who are making decisions right now about whether they need to shut up shop possibly get money and support fast enough to stave off the worst? Can families who have lost their sources of income get help quickly so they can pay the bills right now? There is pressure on the ministers to answer these, and many other questions as quickly as they can. But with the government announcing enormous and expensive emergency promises, planes grounded, hospital operations cancelled, even religious worship curtailed, for now, even if on a temporary basis, the UK is changing before our eyes.

"Stories have been circulating online suggesting it's dangerous to take ibuprofen if you have coronavirus. Alongside genuine medical advice, false messages have been spreading, distorting the facts. Speaking to the BBC, medical professionals said that ibuprofen is not recommended for managing coronavirus symptoms. The NHS says that, while ""there is currently no strong evidence that ibuprofen can make coronavirus (Covid-19) worse, until we have more information take paracetamol to treat the symptoms of coronavirus, unless your doctor has told you paracetamol is not suitable for you."" Those already taking ibuprofen for other conditions should not stop without consulting a doctor, though. Both paracetamol and ibuprofen can bring a temperature down and help with flu-like symptoms. But ibuprofen and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are not suitable for everyone and can cause side-effects - especially for people with asthma, heart and circulatory problems. The NHS website previously recommended both paracetamol and ibuprofen, but has since changed its advice. There is also some evidence linking ibuprofen to more severe illness from other respiratory infections. But whatever the advice, there's still been a great deal of misinformation online. Bogus messages have been circulating on WhatsApp claiming that: â¢           ""There are four young people in an intensive care unit in Cork who have no underlying illnesses - all were taking anti-inflammatories and there are concerns this has caused a more severe illness""(false) â¢           The University of Vienna has sent a memo warning people with coronavirus symptoms not to take ibuprofen, ""because it has been discovered that it increases the speed of reproduction of the coronavirus Covid-19 in the body and this is the reason why people in Italy have reached the current bad stage and rapid spread""(false) â¢           ""At the university hospital in Toulouse, France, there are four very critical cases of coronavirus in [young people] who do not have any health problems. Their problem is that when they all appeared to have symptoms, they all took painkillers like ibuprofen""(false) These stories circulating on WhatsApp are also appearing on different platforms including Instagram. Commonly these kinds of copied-and-pasted texts will claim to be from someone the forwarder says they know, often with a medical background. The Infectious Diseases Society of Ireland said a WhatsApp message circulating about coronavirus patients in Cork is ""a fake message"", asking anyone who receives it to ""ignore and delete"".

Toulouse University Hospital warned that inaccurate information was circulating on social networks, saying it would not have discussed the care of patients due to medical confidentiality. There has been no research into ibuprofen and the new coronavirus (Covid-19). But there has been some for other respiratory infections, suggesting ibuprofen is linked to more complications and more severe illness, according to Paul Little, a professor of primary care research at University of Southampton. Experts believe that ibuprofen's anti-inflammatory properties may ""dampen"" the body's immune response. Prof Parastou Donyai at the University of Reading says: ""There are many studies that suggest ibuprofen use during a respiratory infection can result in worsening of the disease or other complications."" But, she says, ""I have not seen any scientific evidence that clearly shows a totally healthy 25 year old taking ibuprofen for symptoms of COVID-19 is putting themselves at additional risk of complications."" Although we don't yet know whether ibuprofen has a particular effect on the severity or length of illnesses caused by coronavirus - either in healthy people or those with underlying conditions - Dr Charlotte Warren-Gash, of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, says, especially for vulnerable patients, ""it seems sensible to stick to paracetamol as first choice"". Paracetamol has sold out in many pharmacies Worries over the use of ibuprofen appear to have surfaced in France, after Jean-Louis Montastruc, a doctor at Toulouse University Hospital warned on Twitter that: ""In this period of coronavirus, it is necessary to remember the risk of complications of the NSAIDs in case of fever or infection."" A subsequent tweet by France's health minister, Olivier Veran, saying that anti-inflammatory drugs ""could be an aggravating factor of the infection"" was shared more than 43,000 times.  But he also said people should consult a doctor before stopping taking them. Other tweets are also being shared including one saying that ibuprofen ""may cause severe cases of the disease, even in young and middle-aged adults with no underlying conditions"" which has been shared more than 94,000 times on Twitter. Many people on social media appeared to have ""a doctor in the family"" with inside information A lack of clear consensus on the issue from the medical profession has led to mixed messages and rumours spreading online, and the University of Vienna laboratory claim noted earlier seems to have taken on a life of its own in both English and German. Twitter and Facebook posts - which seem to be cut-and-pasted and adapted by users - all claim to have a ""doctor in the family"" who has information from the Vienna lab that ""the vast majority of people who died of Covid-19 had ibuprofen in their system"". Some of the posts go on to claim that coronavirus ""thrives on ibuprofen"". There is no evidence that this is the case. This online rumour also appeared on German-language WhatsApp as voice message and text messages. These messages typically claimed to be from a young mother saying that the Vienna lab had researched Covid-19 deaths in Italy and found that the majority had self-medicated with ibuprofen. The message offers no specific evidence to back up its claims, according to German pharmaceutical news website aponet.de. ""Such a pattern is typical of conspiracy theories,"" it concludes.

"This video can not be played Rishi Sunak: ""We have never in peacetime faced an economic fight like this one"" The government has unveiled a package of financial measures to shore up the economy against the coronavirus impact. It includes Â£330bn in loans, Â£20bn in other aid, a business rates holiday, and grants for retailers and pubs. Help for airlines is also being considered. Chancellor Rishi Sunak told a press conference it was an ""economic emergency. Never in peacetime have we faced an economic fight like this one."" And he promised that if this package was not enough, he would go further. From the hospitality industry to the airline sector, companies have warned that their long term survival is under threat. Mr Sunak said: ""This is not a time for ideology and orthodoxy, this is a time to be bold, a time for courage. I want to reassure every British citizen this government will give you all the tools you need to get through this. ""That means any business who needs access to cash to pay their rent, their salaries, suppliers or purchase stock will be able to access a government-backed loan or credit on attractive terms. ""And if demand is greater than the initial Â£330bn [for loans] I'm making available today, I will go further and provide as much capacity as required. I said whatever it takes, and I meant it,"" he said. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said during the same media briefing that ""we must do whatever it takes to support the economy"".

The chancellor said he was extending the business rates holiday to all firms in the hospitality sector and funding grants of between Â£10,000 and Â£25,000 for small businesses. And Mr Sunak said that for those in financial difficulty due to coronavirus, mortgage lenders will offer a three-month mortgage holiday. BBC personal finance correspondent Simon Gompertz said it was important for borrowers to remember that they would have to make up the payments at a later date. ""The result is that you have some breathing space but when you resume payments the amount will be adjusted to be slightly higher, because the missed interest payments have been added to the loan,"" he said. ""This doesn't mean the mortgage holiday is a bad idea."" The chancellor unveiled the measures after the government's chief scientific adviser said about 55,000 people in the UK now have Covid-19, as the NHS moved to cancel all non-emergency surgery and 71 people are now known to have died. ""Whatever it takes"" was the promise from the chancellor to support businesses, families and individuals through the coronavirus crisis. It was a phrase successfully used by a European central banker eight years ago - and effectively calmed a significant eurozone crisis. But this intervention is a bigger bazooka than that, because the challenge of coronavirus and the measures to contain it pose to peoples livelihoods and wellbeing are more significant. The extraordinary figure here was Â£330bn in state-backed loans for all businesses through the banking system with the help of the Bank of England. That is 15% of the value of the economy. Normally economic announcements are worth a fraction of a percent of national income - this move is about a fraction of our entire GDP.

Companies and trade bodies welcomed the announcement, but said they needed to work through the fine print.

The British Retail Consortium (BRC) said the new measures would help ease the burden. BRC chief executive Helen Dickinson said: ""The business rates holiday, together with the announcement of a loan package, represent a vital shot in the arm for a sector facing enormous uncertainty. We still need to see the details and make sure that retailers can access cash with the minimum of delay, but it is a welcome and necessary first step to protect jobs. Adam Marshall, chief executive of the British Chambers of Commerce, said the size of the grants and loans were good news for smaller businesses. ""But what's going to be hugely importantâ. is that cash actually gets to the front line and gets there quickly,"" he said. Paul Johnson, director of the Institute of Fiscal Studies, said the business rates holiday was targeted directly at the retail, leisure and hospitality sectors. But he warned: ""This is a substantial level of support. However, it is probably not well targeted at saving jobs in those industries. It will remain as expensive to pay people and if demand is down then jobs are likely to go."" He said it may be necessary to cut employer national insurance contributions, delay increases to the National Living Wage, and increase support for individuals through Universal Credit.

"Hashem Abedi was arrested in Libya the day after the bombing The brother of Manchester Arena bomber Salman Abedi has been found guilty of murdering 22 people. Hashem Abedi had denied helping to plan the ""sudden and lethal"" blast which killed or injured ""nearly 1,000"". The Old Bailey heard the pair worked together to source materials used in the suicide blast after an Ariana Grande show at the venue. Prosecutors said Hashem was ""jointly responsible"" with his brother for the attack on 22 May 2017. The Manchester-born siblings ""stood shoulder to shoulder"" in the plot, with younger sibling Hashem ""just as guilty of murder"" as the bomber himself, the court heard. The road to the Manchester Arena bombing Hashem, 22, was also found guilty of one count of attempted murder, encompassing the remaining injured, and conspiring to cause explosions. He was not in court for the unanimous verdicts after hedismissed his legal team last weekand decided to take no further part in the trial. Top (left to right): Lisa Lees, Alison Howe, Georgina Callender, Kelly Brewster, John Atkinson, Jane Tweddle, Marcin Klis, Eilidh MacLeod - Middle (left to right): Angelika Klis, Courtney Boyle, Saffie Roussos, Olivia Campbell-Hardy, Martyn Hett, Michelle Kiss, Philip Tron, Elaine McIver - Bottom (left to right): Wendy Fawell, Chloe Rutherford, Liam Allen-Curry, Sorrell Leczkowski, Megan Hurley, Nell Jones Some of the victims' family members burst into tears as the verdicts were delivered after the seven-week trial. Figen Murray, mother of victim Martyn Hett, said while the verdicts bring her ""comfort to know the British justice system has played its role...it doesn't give us closure"". His father, Paul Hett, added that while ""this verdict will not bring back the 22 victims murdered by Salman and Hashem Abedi,"" he said it will provide ""an overwhelming sense of justice to all those affected by this heinous crime"". Manchester attack: Who were the victims? Twenty-two men, women and children, aged eight to 51, were killed in the attack while 264 ""were physically injured"" and 670 more have since ""reported psychological trauma as a result of these events"". Duncan Penny QC, prosecuting, said the Abedi brothers had spent ""months"" planning the blast and had a ""shared goal [to] kill, maim and injure as many people as possible"". The bomb comprised a five-litre paint can placed inside a money tin, packed with thousands of nuts and screws They worked together to source chemicals and buy screws and nails to use as ""anti-personnel shrapnel"" in experimental improvised bombs, the court was told. The brothers used 11 mobile phones in five months - some for as little as two hours - and used a variety of vehicles, despite neither passing their driving test, to transport components around the city. Afterwards, police found Hashem's fingerprints at key addresses and in a car, which still contained traces of explosives. Although he was in Libya when the device was detonated he was ""just as guilty"" as his brother, Mr Penny said. This video can not be played Footage of Manchester Arena bomber Salman Abedi Greater Manchester Police said Hashem may have been the senior figure in the plot, and intended to cause ""further bloodshed"" around the world. The former Manchester College electrical installation student held down a series of menial jobs working in restaurants and takeaways, including a Â£5-an-hour role as a delivery driver. He was described as ""unreliable"" and ""with the wrong idea of Islam"" by his boss, before he left for his parents' home country of Libya, 2,000 miles away, a month before the bombing. Hashem was detained a day after the attack, and claimed he was subjected to torture by Libyan militiamen before his extradition two years later. He told police he was ""relieved to be back in the UK"", adding: ""[I] wish to assist in this investigation as much as I can."" He then offered ""no comment"" during police interviews. Salman Abedi and his brother lived in Fallowfield, four miles south of Manchester city centre Det Ch Supt Simon Barraclough said Hashem was ""with his brother throughout the entire process"" of making and building the bomb and that he had taken a four-minute phone call from Salman on the night the device went off. ""At that point he (Salman) is getting that last-minute inspiration (from Hashem)...and he's telling him what he's about to do,"" he said. ""I believe he provided encouragement right up to the end. This was all about the sick ideology of Islamic State and this desire for martyrdom."" He added: ""These two brothers are literally hand in glove in this process."" Salman Abedi was seen on CCTV arriving at Manchester Victoria station carrying a rucksack Following the verdicts, lawyer Victoria Higgins - representing 11 of the bereaved families - said they were relieved that the ""calculating"" killer had finally been brought to justice. ""Families have waited a long time to see Hashem Abedi face justice for his crimes and I think the overwhelming emotion for most will be one of relief that he cannot hurt anyone else,"" she said. Sentencing will take place at a later date but the judge Mr Justice Jeremy Baker said it was a ""little way off"". A public inquiry into the bombing is due to begin in June.

"This video can not be played Joe Biden addresses Bernie Sanders' supporters: ""I hear you... I know what we have to do"" Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden has steamrolled rival Bernie Sanders in primary elections in Florida, Illinois and Arizona. Accelerating his momentum in the race, the former US vice-president made a clean sweep in all three states. Mr Biden appealed for support directly to Sanders supporters. With his hat-trick, Mr Biden took another big stride towards becoming the Democratic candidate who will face President Donald Trump in November. Mr Biden won a smashing victory over Mr Sanders in Florida, the biggest prize of the night with 219 delegates. The former vice-president won 62% of the vote and about 130 delegates. Mr Sanders, with only 23%, took some 48 delegates, with the rest still to be distributed. Mr Trump won that traditional battleground state by 1.2 percentage points in the 2016 presidential election. In Illinois, with most precincts reporting, Mr Biden led the Vermont senator by 59% to 36%. With most votes counted in Arizona, Mr Biden has a double-digit lead over Mr Sanders in the south-western state. A Democratic candidate needs 1,991 delegates to clinch the nomination. Will Joe Biden's record come back to haunt him? On the eve of Tuesday's vote, Mr Biden was hoping to build on his victories in 16 of the last 21 state contests. The former US vice-president's triumph last month in South Carolina - his first ever primary win over three campaigns for president - resuscitated his faltering campaign. According to opinion polling, most voters said electability was a priority for them. About three in four Florida voters said Mr Biden would have a better chance of beating Mr Trump, a Republican. Just one in five said the same of Mr Sanders. Older voters were more likely to say they supported Mr Biden. Nearly half of Florida's voters said Mr Sanders' stances were too liberal. This video can not be played What unites these two bitter rivals? In a webcam speech from his home in Wilmington, Delaware, to comply with US anti-coronavirus advice against public gatherings, Mr Biden appealed to Mr Sanders' passionate supporters. He said: ""Let me say, especially to the young voters who have been inspired by Senator Sanders, I hear you, I know what's at stake, I know what we have to do."" But he focused largely on the outbreak sweeping the US, striking a unifying tone as he said: ""The coronavirus doesn't care if you're a Democrat or a Republican... we're all in this together."" Mr Sanders hosted an online address from Washington DC, but he did not drop any hints about the future of his campaign. He instead talked about the coronavirus crisis, outlining proposals to address the pandemic, which he said would cost some $2tn. Eighteen things Bernie Sanders believes How much does Sanders want to spend? This video can not be played Biden will have to win over young voters like Alexis and Amira. Democrats in three states have just cemented the presidential nomination for Joe Biden. Bernie Sanders was soundly defeated in Illinois and Arizona and routed in Florida, where in one county he finished third behind Michael Bloomberg, who dropped out weeks ago. He will fall even further behind in the national convention delegate count, as the primary season appears to be heading towards suspended animation, with multiple states delaying their contests until June. Mr Sanders should have a long think about how long he wants to stay in this fight, even if he does have more than enough financial resources to carry on. He is going to face growing calls from Democrats to gracefully bow out - something he did not do until the eve of the convention four years ago, much to the consternation of many Hillary Clinton supporters. The bottom line for Mr Sanders may be evaluating what's best for the movement he created. Will staying in the race give him a continuing platform to talk about his issues and buy him time for a potential comeback? Or will hanging around only increase the chances that he is relegated to an electoral afterthought? Read Anthony's full takeaways Also on Tuesday night, the US president officially clinched the Republican party nomination with a win in the Illinois primary. His victory had been a foregone conclusion in a contest where he has faced only nominal opposition from a former Massachusetts Governor, Bill Weld. Illinois' delegates drove Mr Trump over the 1,276-delegate threshold required to become the party's standard-bearer. Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel congratulated the president on Twitter for ""officially becoming the presumptive Republican nominee"". This video can not be played Biden curses Michigan voter who said he's taking Americans' guns. Ohio was also due to hold a primary on Tuesday, but it cancelled the vote hours before polls were due to open, putting it off till June. Voters in the three states that did head to polling stations on Tuesday encountered hand sanitiser dispensers and workers in surgical gloves. Several other states have postponed their Democratic presidential primaries, including Georgia, Louisiana, Maryland and Kentucky. Coronavirus-wary voters cast their ballots in Florida The Democratic National Committee blasted Ohio for sowing ""chaos and confusion"" and urged remaining primary states not to follow suit. But Puerto Rico, which is scheduled to hold the next Democratic primary on 29 March, is also planning to reschedule. Party grandees are encouraging states and territories instead to extend postal and early voting to reduce public exposure to the virus. On Tuesday, the US Secret Service said it would this week begin providing full protection for Mr Biden. His codename will be Celtic, the same as when he was vice-president. Mr Biden requested the security detail after being repeatedly accosted by protesters on the campaign trail. Two protesters rushed a stage in Los Angeles earlier this month and came within a stride of the candidate as he gave a victory speech. Mr Sanders has not made a request for Secret Service protection.

Adam Marshall, chief executive of the British Chambers of Commerce, said the size of the grants and loans were good news for smaller businesses. ""But what's going to be hugely importantâ. is that cash actually gets to the front line and gets there quickly,"" he said. Paul Johnson, director of the Institute of Fiscal Studies, said the business rates holiday was targeted directly at the retail, leisure and hospitality sectors. But he warned: ""This is a substantial level of support. However, it is probably not well targeted at saving jobs in those industries. It will remain as expensive to pay people and if demand is down then jobs are likely to go."" He said it may be necessary to cut employer national insurance contributions, delay increases to the National Living Wage, and increase support for individuals through Universal Credit.

"This video can not be played Joe Biden addresses Bernie Sanders' supporters: ""I hear you... I know what we have to do"" Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden has steamrolled rival Bernie Sanders in primary elections in Florida, Illinois and Arizona. Accelerating his momentum in the race, the former US vice-president made a clean sweep in all three states. Mr Biden appealed for support directly to Sanders supporters. With his hat-trick, Mr Biden took another big stride towards becoming the Democratic candidate who will face President Donald Trump in November. Mr Biden won a smashing victory over Mr Sanders in Florida, the biggest prize of the night with 219 delegates. The former vice-president won 62% of the vote and about 130 delegates. Mr Sanders, with only 23%, took some 48 delegates, with the rest still to be distributed. Mr Trump won that traditional battleground state by 1.2 percentage points in the 2016 presidential election. In Illinois, with most precincts reporting, Mr Biden led the Vermont senator by 59% to 36%. With most votes counted in Arizona, Mr Biden has a double-digit lead over Mr Sanders in the south-western state. A Democratic candidate needs 1,991 delegates to clinch the nomination. Will Joe Biden's record come back to haunt him? On the eve of Tuesday's vote, Mr Biden was hoping to build on his victories in 16 of the last 21 state contests. The former US vice-president's triumph last month in South Carolina - his first ever primary win over three campaigns for president - resuscitated his faltering campaign. According to opinion polling, most voters said electability was a priority for them. About three in four Florida voters said Mr Biden would have a better chance of beating Mr Trump, a Republican. Just one in five said the same of Mr Sanders. Older voters were more likely to say they supported Mr Biden. Nearly half of Florida's voters said Mr Sanders' stances were too liberal. This video can not be played What unites these two bitter rivals? In a webcam speech from his home in Wilmington, Delaware, to comply with US anti-coronavirus advice against public gatherings, Mr Biden appealed to Mr Sanders' passionate supporters. He said: ""Let me say, especially to the young voters who have been inspired by Senator Sanders, I hear you, I know what's at stake, I know what we have to do."" But he focused largely on the outbreak sweeping the US, striking a unifying tone as he said: ""The coronavirus doesn't care if you're a Democrat or a Republican... we're all in this together."" Mr Sanders hosted an online address from Washington DC, but he did not drop any hints about the future of his campaign. He instead talked about the coronavirus crisis, outlining proposals to address the pandemic, which he said would cost some $2tn. Eighteen things Bernie Sanders believes How much does Sanders want to spend? This video can not be played Biden will have to win over young voters like Alexis and Amira. Democrats in three states have just cemented the presidential nomination for Joe Biden. Bernie Sanders was soundly defeated in Illinois and Arizona and routed in Florida, where in one county he finished third behind Michael Bloomberg, who dropped out weeks ago. He will fall even further behind in the national convention delegate count, as the primary season appears to be heading towards suspended animation, with multiple states delaying their contests until June. Mr Sanders should have a long think about how long he wants to stay in this fight, even if he does have more than enough financial resources to carry on. He is going to face growing calls from Democrats to gracefully bow out - something he did not do until the eve of the convention four years ago, much to the consternation of many Hillary Clinton supporters. The bottom line for Mr Sanders may be evaluating what's best for the movement he created. Will staying in the race give him a continuing platform to talk about his issues and buy him time for a potential comeback? Or will hanging around only increase the chances that he is relegated to an electoral afterthought? Read Anthony's full takeaways Also on Tuesday night, the US president officially clinched the Republican party nomination with a win in the Illinois primary. His victory had been a foregone conclusion in a contest where he has faced only nominal opposition from a former Massachusetts Governor, Bill Weld. Illinois' delegates drove Mr Trump over the 1,276-delegate threshold required to become the party's standard-bearer. Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel congratulated the president on Twitter for ""officially becoming the presumptive Republican nominee"". This video can not be played Biden curses Michigan voter who said he's taking Americans' guns. Ohio was also due to hold a primary on Tuesday, but it cancelled the vote hours before polls were due to open, putting it off till June. Voters in the three states that did head to polling stations on Tuesday encountered hand sanitiser dispensers and workers in surgical gloves. Several other states have postponed their Democratic presidential primaries, including Georgia, Louisiana, Maryland and Kentucky. Coronavirus-wary voters cast their ballots in Florida The Democratic National Committee blasted Ohio for sowing ""chaos and confusion"" and urged remaining primary states not to follow suit. But Puerto Rico, which is scheduled to hold the next Democratic primary on 29 March, is also planning to reschedule. Party grandees are encouraging states and territories instead to extend postal and early voting to reduce public exposure to the virus. On Tuesday, the US Secret Service said it would this week begin providing full protection for Mr Biden. His codename will be Celtic, the same as when he was vice-president. Mr Biden requested the security detail after being repeatedly accosted by protesters on the campaign trail. Two protesters rushed a stage in Los Angeles earlier this month and came within a stride of the candidate as he gave a victory speech. Mr Sanders has not made a request for Secret Service protection.

"Chancellor Rishi Sunak unveiled a package of financial measures to support the economy on Tuesday As we discussed earlier, the government had to act credibly, and act fast. There is no question that offering to pump more than Â£300bn into the economy to protect it from the worst is a very serious move - the lion's share government backed loans, with around Â£20bn of grants and tax cuts too. You can't question the government's intention tonight to show boldness and to show intent that they will do ""whatever it takes"" (the chancellor and the PM's mantra) not just to support the health of the country, but our livelihoods too. Rarely, but every now and then, there is a day in Westminster when it feels like the landscape has transformed - and this is one of them. Not just because the size of the promises is vast and represents a huge extension of state intervention in the economy; also, it will have massive implications for the taxpayer for years and years to come. One insider whispered to me that the moves could end up with the government essentially supporting every UK business in one way or another, and the national debt ballooning once again. EASY STEPS:How to keep safe A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? TRAVEL PLANS:What are your rights? IN-DEPTH:Coronavirus pandemic Together with sweeping new powersin the government's emergency legislation, which also deserves careful scrutiny, the government is clearly buckling up for a period of profound disruption and change, and that will see ministers' roles become much more central in all of our lives. There are still holes in the vast plans - it's not yet clear what will happen to people who rent their homes rather than have mortgages. Can businesses who are making decisions right now about whether they need to shut up shop possibly get money and support fast enough to stave off the worst? Can families who have lost their sources of income get help quickly so they can pay the bills right now? There is pressure on the ministers to answer these, and many other questions as quickly as they can. But with the government announcing enormous and expensive emergency promises, planes grounded, hospital operations cancelled, even religious worship curtailed, for now, even if on a temporary basis, the UK is changing before our eyes.

We're pausing our live coverage of the coronavirus pandemic for now but we'll continue to bring you updates across the BBC News website until our teams in Asia pick things up. So for now, here are the latest headlines: We leave you withthis piece that explains two conceptsthat many millions will need to familiarise themselves with: social distancing and self-isolation. And, as always,you can find all of our latest coronavirus stories here. As it stands, the World Health Organisation has confirmed more than 205,000 coronavirus cases worldwide, with the pandemic now affecting over 170 countries. There are many sources for tracking cases, some more reliable than others. Here is a round-up of confirmed cases in 10 the world's hardest-hit countries. We have sourced the figures either from the ongoing tally of cases by Johns Hopkins University or directly from health authorities.  Tasmania, south of the Australian mainland, has announced a state of emergency and a mandatory quarantine on arrivals to prevent the spread of the virus. This includes other Australians and locals heading home from the mainland. The only exceptions are for health and trade workers. The nation's smallest state currently has 10 cases, while there are around 270 in New South Wales and 150 in Victoria - states which have 15 times larger populations. State premier Peter Gutwein says these are the ""toughest border measures in the country"". UK medical staff say they are being put at risk during the coronavirus outbreak because of a lack of protective gear. One NHS doctor told the BBC that frontline healthcare workers felt like ""cannon fodder"" due to inadequate supplies of vital equipment such as face masks. Dr Frances Mair told Newsnight her GP practice in Scotland and ""many others"" did not have the personal protective equipment needed ""to keep us safe"". ""It's very disheartening when you hear of colleagues talking about the way that they feel they are like cannon fodder, sent out to die."" Dr Nishant Joshi, who works in A&E at Luton and Dunstable general hospital, said staff were at ""grave risk"". ""We're fighting an invisible enemy, blindfolded, with both hands tied behind our backs,"" he told Radio 5 Live's Emma Barnett. Earlier on Wednesday, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the UK had ""stockpiles"" of equipment ready to be used. Read more here.  Canada's chief public health official, Dr Theresa Tam, says there has been a ""sharp rise"" in cases over the last week that point to community spread of Covid-19. ""A number of provinces have reported cases with no links to travel,"" Dr Tam said. ""Our time to act is now."" There are currently 598 cases confirmed in Canada and eight deaths.  G'day from Australia, where it's Thursday. The nation has now recorded close to 600 cases including six deaths. Authorities are urging social distancing but standing by policies to keep schools, public transport and other ""essential"" services open. Prime Minister Scott Morrison yesterday also instructed Australians to not travel abroad - that's led to an announcement from the national carrier Qantas this morning. The airline, and its sister budget carrier Jetstar are temporarily standing down two-thirds of their 30,000 employees ""to preserve as many jobs as possible longer term"". All international flights will be suspended from late March. Virgin Australia also suspended routes yesterday. Canberra announced a raft of measures on Wednesday,catch up on those key restrictions here. The nation's central bank, the Reserve Bank of Australia is also set to announce more economic drivers today. President Donald Trump has said the US government's housing agency will stop repossessing homes until the end of April. Evictions will be suspended over the same time frame in a moratorium protecting eight million mortgages. Two US Navy hospitals ships will also be sent to help relieve an expected shortage of sick beds. Read more here A sign above a street in Venice reads: ""Everything will be alright."" The dire news from Italy is that despite a lockdown that has been in place for 10 days across the country, the death toll from this virus has continued to rise and rise. It increased by 475 on Wednesday, the biggest in one day since the outbreak began, with 319 of these deaths occuring in the northern region of Lombardy, which has been the worst-affected. Italian doctors had hoped to see infections slowing after a week of lockdown but that hasn't happened. Some say that only after two weeks - believed to be the maximum time period it takes for symptoms to show - will they truly be able to see if the virus's spread has been slowed by the drastic measures taken. The governor of Lombardy has appealed to the public to continue to stay at home and not flout the government's orders. ""Soon we will no longer be in a position to assist those who are sick,"" Attilio Fontana said earlier today. ""We are asking you to make a sacrifice to save lives.""   The number of confirmed cases in Ireland has risen by 74, bringing the total number to 366, the Department of Health has said. The cases are made up of 29 females and 45 males, it added. On Tuesday, PM Leo Varadkar said Ireland could have 15,000 cases of coronavirus before the end of March. In a St Patrick's Day address, he warned of ""significant and lasting"" economic damage and said the emergency could last into the summer. The government has already closed pubs, schools and universities. This video can not be played Coronavirus explained in 60 seconds What actually is the coronavirus? How might it affect you? What can you do to prevent it? The BBC's Laura Foster explains everything you need to know â in just one minute. There's one major question about this pandemic that millions of people will be hoping has a positive answer: will we see a vaccine anytime soon? Well, earlier today, we heard some promising words from the world's leading public health body. The World Health Organization (WHO) hailed an ""incredible achievement"" in the effort to produce a vaccine for the coronavirus. ""The first vaccine trial has begun, just 60 days after the genetic sequence of the coronavirus was shared,"" WHO chief Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told reporters. That trial began in the USat the Kaiser Permanente research facility in Seattle earlier this week. Four patients received the jab, which cannot cause Covid-19 but contains a harmless genetic code copied from the virus. Now for the bad news. Experts warn that it will be many months before it is clear whether this vaccine, or any of the others that are also in research, will work. And even if these initial safety tests go well, it will still take time for any potential vaccine to become available to the public. It means, realistically, one would not be ready until at least the middle of next year. But don't be too disheartened. Scientists around the world are fast-tracking research in an effort to mass produce a safe vaccine as soon as possible. Stephen McGrath, Romania Jim Turnbull decided to donate the sanitiser to his community Jim Turnbull owns a food production facility in the Romanian region of Transylvania and was due to return to the UK on Tuesday but decided to stay on. He has begun using the alcohol by-product from his elderflower gin distillation to make a hand sanitiser followingguidance by the World Health Organization,external. âGiven the crisis we thought to donate it to our local community - where we get our workforce from,â says Mr Turnbull, 68, who lives in the village of Saschiz, which has a population of some 2,000. Romania has so far had 260 confirmed cases of coronavirus but no deaths. However, its rural population, which makes up around 46% of the countryâs 19 million people, is ageing and could be vulnerable. Bars and restaurants have been shut but Bogdan Tanase, head of Romaniaâs Doctors' Alliance, told the BBC Romania was âill-prepared to deal with an epidemicâ. On Wednesday alone, police in France have handed out more than 4,000 fines to people violating government orders to stay at home. Interior Minister Christophe Castaner told local outlet TF1 that the fine has been increased from â¬35 ($38; Â£32), and can be as much as â¬375 to try to dissuade people. Since yesterday, people in France have been banned from going outside except for exercise and essential trips. During a White House briefing today, President Trump was questioned on his repeated use of the term ""Chinese virus"" to describe Covid-19 - a term critics say has contributed to racism against Asian-Americans - as well as why top US athletes have had access to tests when most Americans haven't. ""Perhaps thatâs been the story of life,"" Trump remarked.

Here some key developments from today:  Much of the world's attention has been focused on Europe, the continent that is currently the worst-affected by the coronavirus pandemic. But other developments have been reported around the world as the virus continues to spread: Prof Sian Griffiths is asked by BBC One viewers when and how will we know if these social distancing measures are working. She says: ""You can see changes in people's behaviour, but that's not very accurate. ""We will see it by a fall in the number of positive tests, the number going into hospital and sadly by the numbers who have passed away."" There has been a rise today of nearly 700 cases in the UK, and a total of 104 deaths, so BBC medical correspondent Fergus Walsh is asked, what next? ""The key message is we are all in this together,"" he says. ""We have to wash our hands, we have to comply... if we don't and if we don't see the number of cases reduce in three weeks time, what is advisory could become compulsory."" But Prof Griffiths reminds viewers: ""This too will pass."" Victoria in Belfast ""I am furious over the school closures. I am a self-employed mother of twins. I have zero support.
