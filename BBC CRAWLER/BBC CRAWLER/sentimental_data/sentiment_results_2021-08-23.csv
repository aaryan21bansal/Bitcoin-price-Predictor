"Millie Court and Liam Reardon Almost three million people tuned in live to watch Millie Court and Liam Reardon be crowned winners of this year's Love Island on Monday. The pair beat three other couples to the hit ITV2 show's Â£50,000 prize. The dating show's finale attracted an average live audience of 2.8 million. That's a 22% drop from the 3.6 million who tuned in to the climax ofthe last summer series in 2019, but an improvement on the figures forlast year's inaugural winter series. This year's series - the first since the programme made its winter debut just before Covid hit in early 2020 - has been broadcast from its Spanish villa for the past eight weeks. Millie, a fashion buyer's assistant from Essex, had considered splitting from Welsh bricklayer Liam after he was unfaithful during Casa Amor week, but the pair reunited to become exclusive. Speaking after the show, Millie and Liam thanked fans for their support and described their time on Love Island as the ""summer of our lives"". Allow Twitter content?

The couple agreed to share the prize money in the finale, which saw ITV2 outperform many of the main terrestrial channels in the 21:00-22:30 BST timeslot, including ITV, BBC Two, Channel 4 and Channel 5. The broadcaster said a further 400,000 viewers had watched the final episode on the ITV Hub by late morning on Tuesday. ITV boss Kevin Lygo said: ""We're delighted that the final ended on a ratings high, rounding off a series that is on track to be the most popular yet, in terms of viewing on ITV Hub, and averaging over four million per episode across all devices."" The other couples to make it to the final were Chloe Burrows and Toby Aromolaran; Faye Winter and Teddy Soares; and Kaz Kamwi and Tyler Cruickshank. Love Island - are we over the honeymoon phase? Liam Reardon's hometown celebrates Love Island win Love Island row sparks record 25,000 complaints They will be offered ""comprehensive psychological support"" and a ""proactive aftercare package"" on their return from Majorca as part of ITV's revised duty-of-care protocols. However, some of Love Island's staple dramatic twists have proved highly controversial this year. The sight of Faye aggressively confronting Teddy after being shown footage of him from flirting during Casa Amor weekprompted record audience complaints to broadcast regulator Ofcom. That followed thousands of complaints that July's Casa Amor postcard episode wasmanipulative toward the female islanders. TV commentator Scott Bryan said the rise in complaints, while in part down to social media communities knowing ""who to complain to"", suggested audiences were now expecting kinder reality television. ""It's that balance between having that form of entertainment whilst also trying to cause a bit of controversy and create storylines,"" he told BBC Radio 5 Live on Tuesday. Viewers are also beginning to question the authenticity of contestants. Craig Phillips, winner of the first season of Big Brother in 2000, told 5 Live that the cast went into the villa with ""an agenda and commercial direction they want to go in"" and that producers had far more input than during his time as a contestant. The eight finalists before this year's final Bryan said the cooling of Love Island fever suggested the start of a ""downward trend of 'constructed reality', which is what Love Island is"". In her review,The Guardian's Lauren O'Neill said,externalthe show was ""tired"" and this series had ""ended with the whimper of predictability in its ears"". Despite that, the show has remained a significant commercial asset for ITV with itspredominantly young and female audience particularly valuable to advertisers. Kevin Lygo said it had been the most popular programme with 16- to 34-year-olds for 44 nights during its latest run. By Alex Taylor, entertainment reporter Faye's outburst - The fallout from the Casa Amor week is always dramatic, but this year proved especially volatile. Faye's aggressive reaction to a clip, shown without full context to imply her partner Teddy had cheated on her, sparked record complaints. Some viewers alleged manipulation from producers, arguing that Faye's self-professed trust issues had been exploited for dramatic effect. Hugo's loveless summer - Ahead of the series, PE teacher Hugoprompted debate as Love Island's first physically disabled contestant, but once inside the villa it was his admission that he did not like ""fake"" women that turned heads. The comments offended a number of islanders, eventually causing Hugo to tearfully apologise. His search for love didn't improve, with social media recoiling in horror when he shouted ""job done"" seconds after kissing Amy. All is forgiven? - All the men except Jake and Teddy cheated on their partners during their week-long stay in the Casa Amor villa.  You wouldn't have known it approaching the final, however, as Millie forgave Liam, just as Kaz (eventually) gave Tyler another chance. Who says romance is dead? Heartbreak for Jiberty - Jake and Liberty appeared to be one of the season's strongest couples, but their spark eventually fizzled out when Liberty began to get ""the ick"" and doubt Jake's authenticity towards her. The pair split in dramatic fashion before amicably agreeing to leave the villa together on Friday after their final date - much to the disbelief of their fellow islanders. Laura Whitmore's ""multitasking"" struggle - Love Island's host opened up about the challenge of fronting the show as a new mother in a pandemic. The presenter, who has been criticised by some for her infrequent appearances,opened up to fans on Instagram,externalon Monday. ""To get this far hasn't been easy,"" she wrote. ""The last few months have been full on. Getting through fronting the biggest show on the telly means you are faced with daily pressures on and off tv, filming and flying during Covid, media intrusion, being a mother, breastfeeding exclusively, pcr tests, allowing your body to heal, getting that pelvic floor back (she ain't back quite yet!), constant judgement, looking after your mental healthâ¦ Just surviving each day on a manic schedule is tough.""

"This video can not be played ""I am very excited to get started""  - from investment banker to trainee doctor A new medical school at Ulster University's (UU) Magee campus in Londonderry has opened for 70 students. The post-graduate students will begin training as doctors, taking a four-year medical qualification. First Minister Paul Givan said the school's opening was a ""historic occasion for the campus at Magee and for the University of Ulster"". The medical school in Derry has opened aftera number of delays and funding problems. Finance Minister Conor Murphy said the north west has ""suffered for many decades in terms of economic growth"" and that the medical school was ""a marker on the road to much greater economic investment"". It is hoped that the new school will eventually help to address a relative shortage of doctors in Northern Ireland. ""It helps us achieve ultimately an increase in the medical profession which is what we need particularly in the north west and the west of the province,"" Mr Givan toldBBC Radio Foyle. ""Over the next number of years, we will be getting people trained, this will have a very positive impact on in terms of the health and the care that's provided to the people of Northern Ireland"". The medical school at Magee had been due to open in 2019 A review previously commissioned by the Department of Health(DoH) said that Northern Ireland needed at least 100 more medical students a year to meet the increasing demand for doctors. Written prior to the Covid-19 pandemic, that review found there was ""a shortage of doctors working in permanent positions"" as GPs, non-consultant doctors and consultants. It also said that 1,000 more consultants would need to be in place in Northern Ireland by 2033. Up until now, the only medical school in Northern Ireland has been at Queen's University in Belfast (QUB). It admits about 270 medical students each year, with the majority of places for students funded directly by the Department of Health. The graduate medical school at Ulster University was originally planned to open for students in 2019. However, that wasdelayed by two years due to disputesover how the school would be funded. Queen's University Belfast will remain the largest medical school in Northern Ireland Agreement was finally reached by the executive onfunding to allow the school to opento its first group of 70 students in 2021. However, a long-term business case for the school is still being worked on. That is according to a response by Economy Minister Gordon Lyons to an assembly question from Sinn FÃ©in MLA Nicola Brogan in late June. Derry medical school 'a dream come true' The institution waiting to train doctors Mr Lyons said that a ""phase one"" business case would ensure ""that all costs covering the six-year period are identified in relation to the first intake of 70 students becoming fully qualified as doctors"". ""The business case for further phases will be developed by UU building on the costs identified in phase one and would consider the longer-term requirements of the medical school including any potential phased increase in student numbers and construction requirements,"" he added. Ulster University is alsomoving its undergraduate healthcare degrees to its Magee campus in 2022. The new graduate medical school in Derry offers a four-year Bachelor of Medicine and Bachelor of Surgery (MBBS) degree programme. Students will also undertake clinical placements in general practice, and other medical and surgical specialities. Prof Louise Dubras was appointed to oversee the delivery of the medical school The 70 students who begin training on Monday have already completed undergraduate degrees in a range of subjects. Some have previously graduated in medical courses but others have taken non-medical qualifications. Speaking to BBC Radio Foyle, Prof Louise Dubras, the foundation dean of the school, said it was ""with immense pride "" that she welcomed students on Monday. ""The slightly abstract concept I arrived here three years ago to deliver is now absolutely real. These guys are going to be doctors in four years."" Medical director of the Western Trust, Dr Catherine McDonnell, said the opening of the school is ""a landmark occasion"". ""It is going to do many things. The first thing is the stabilisation of the medical workforce, critical to delivering best care and treatment to patients both in hospital facilities and in primary care. ""It puts us in a strong partnership with an academic institution which really helps develop that culture of excellence. It allows us to build on our education facilities and research networks and connections,"" she said. Foyle MP Colum Eastwood said the arrival of the first trainee doctors was a ""positive day for Derry"". ""After a long fight, we are finally opening the doors of our medical school which will give young people from the north west the opportunity to study, live and set down roots in our communities. ""This school will, I hope, also allow us to fortify health provision here with a good supply of well educated doctors keen to serve in the local area."" Dawn McLaughlin, Londonderry Chamber president, said the expansion of the Magee campus is ""an important economic driver"" for Derry. ""We want this to be the catalyst for change,"" she said.

"Fans clashed with police and stewards after hundreds of people tried to storm the ground before the match A Wembley steward who tried to sell security wristbands and lanyards to ticketless fans for the Euro 2020 final has been sentenced. Yusaf Amin, of Clifford Road, Newham, posted screenshots on Facebook Marketplace offering two passes, uniforms and wristbands for Â£4,500. The 18-year-old was arrested after a woman saw the post and called police. He was handed a six-month sentence in a young offenders' institute, suspended for 12 months. Clashes occurred between fans and members of security when hundreds of the people tried to the storm the ground for the match between England and Italy on 11 July. Hours before kick-off, Amin, whopreviously pleaded guilty to theft, wrote on Facebook: ""Steward pass available x2 with uniform and pass and I'm outside Wembley.

""Yet there you were offering out hi-vis jackets, accreditation passes and wristbands... putting at risk the security and the safety of other fans within the ground."" He added that he accepted Amin had been trying to raise the money for his mother but he should have known the ""risks caused"" by his actions. Praising the woman who called police, the judge said: ""Without people like her acting in such a publicly spirited way, I don't know the guilt you would have felt if someone had gotten into the ground and had behaved badly."" Dalha Mohamad was also accused of theft but pleaded not guilty and is due to go on trial in December As well as his suspended sentence, Amin was ordered to pay Â£213 in legal costs, carry out 200 hours of unpaid work and go to an attendance centre.

"Jagtar Singh Johal, from Dumbarton, is being held under India's anti-terror law First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has called on the UK's foreign secretary to meet the family of a man held in an Indian prison for almost four years. Jagtar Singh Johal, from Dumbarton, is being held under India's anti-terror laws, accused of conspiring to murder a number of right-wing Hindu leaders. Mr Johal has previously said via his lawyer he had been ""falsely implicated"" and tortured into making a confession. Ms Sturgeon said she was concerned about his detention without trial. In her letter to Dominic Raab, she also said she was ""deeply concerned"" about allegations of torture and mistreatment of Mr Johal while in custody. Brit 'tortured to sign blank confession' in India The Indian authorities strongly deny the allegations and have said ""there is no evidence of mistreatment or torture as alleged"". Mr Johal travelled to India from Scotland in October 2017 for his wedding. Videos of the occasion show the new groom jumping enthusiastically to Bhangra music as he celebrated. Jagtar got married in India in 2017 But a fortnight later, while on a shopping trip with his new bride in the North Indian state of Punjab, Mr Johal was taken away by police and has been in detention ever since. His brother Gurpreet, who lives in Scotland, says Mr Johal was a peaceful activist and is convinced he was arrested because he had written about historical human rights violations against Sikhs in India. Gurpreet Singh Johal met Ms Sturgeon earlier this month to ask for her support. The first minister's letter to Mr Raab said Gurpreet was disappointed with the support from the Foreign Office and that he could not get a meeting with the foreign secretary. UK Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab has raised the case with his Indian counterpart Ms Sturgeon asked Mr Raab to ""personally"" meet the family of Mr Johal to hear their concerns and provide assurances of adequate assistance. She also asked him to raise the allegations of torture and the importance of a fair trial with the Indian authorities. Gurpreet Singh Johal said he last spoke to his brother, who is being held in Delhi's maximum security Tihar jail, about three weeks ago. He said Mr Johal was in ""good spirits"" but was concerned at the delays to his case. Gurpreet Singh Johal met Nicola Sturgeon last week Gurpreet Johal said he was grateful to finally meet Ms Sturgeon after his brother had been detained for almost four years. Of the UK government, he said: ""It is disappointing that a British national is being detained in an Indian jail for 1,380 days and they have still not called for his release."" Charge-sheets from the Indian authorities outline the case against Mr Johal and a group of men whom they believe were involved in a ""series of killings"" of right wing Hindu leaders. It is claimed Mr Johal was a member of Khalistan Liberation Front (KLF), described in the documents as an international ""terrorist gang"". He is accused of paying Â£3,000 to the former head of the KLF to help fund the crimes. The documents claim he ""actively participated and had complete knowledge of the conspiracy"". ""There are very serious charges against him including murder and abetment of terrorism,"" an Indian government official told the BBC. ""The seriousness of charges against him have been shared with the British authorities,"" they added. Mr Johal has been represented by the human rights organisation Reprieve since last year. Hundreds of people have protested outside the Foreign Office Its Deputy Director Harriet McCulloch told the BBC he had been ""failed"" by the UK government. She said: ""He's arbitrarily detained and he's facing the death penalty in relation to charges that have been brought on the basis of a torture confession. ""The UK government has a stated domestic policy of calling for the release of people like Jagtar who are being arbitrarily detained or held on no legal basis so it's the UK government's obligation to call for his release."" ""The UK [government] has so far failed to get any results for Jagtar and his family."" Ms McCulloch also criticised Prime Minister Boris Johnson for not raising Mr Johal's case at a meeting with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi earlier this year. A spokesman for the Foreign Office said: ""We have consistently raised our concerns about Mr Johal's case with the government of India, including his allegations of torture and mistreatment and his right to a fair trial. ""In-person consular visits in India are currently suspended due to the coronavirus pandemic. However, consular staff have regular telephone calls with Mr Johal in lieu of visits.""

"The festival was held at Watergate Bay in Cornwall and was headlined by Gorillaz, Jorja Smith and Foals More than 4,000 Covid cases could have links to a music and surfing festival, with more expected in the coming days. Cornwall Council said 4,700 cases may be linked to the Boardmasters event between 11 and 15 August. About 50,000 people attended the festival in and around Newquay, which now has the three neighbourhoods with the highest infection rates in England. Cornwall's public health team said: ""We won't know the complete picture for another few days."" About 800 of those positive cases are people who live in Cornwall. The figure comes after the Swansea Bay health board in Wales said on Friday about50 cases there had been linked to the festival. Ruth Goldstein, deputy director of public health for Cornwall and the Isles of Scilly, said: ""At the moment, there are currently about 4,700 which could be linked to Boardmasters. ""These are people who have noted when they have had a PCR test, they have been associated to Boardmasters. ""We don't know whether they have been camping, or to events on the beach, or to parties in the town put on by Boardmasters. ""Of those people, three-quarters of them are aged between 16 and 21, which is exactly the profile of the people who we know attend the festival."" Andy Virr - Cornwall Council portfolio holder for adults, and an emergency doctor - said cases were expected but he was ""reassured"" they were not ""translating into a serious life-threatening illness"". He added there were ""benefits"" from holding the event, although the possibility of cancelling it was discussed by the council. He told a press briefing: ""Covid will have lots of impacts ongoing, and one of them is around loneliness and isolation and mental health problems. ""That festival brought a lot of joy to people. And, yes, there are some things we are having to deal with, but that was part of the judgement. ""I think, at the moment, there are no regrets - we were expecting to have this wash-up to deal with."" Three parts of Newquay now have the three highest Covid infection rates in England for the seven days up to 18 August: Newquay East - 1806.1 cases per 100,000 people Newquay West - 1418.3 St Columb Minor and Porth - 1354 The national average of neighbourhood areas within English local authorities is 308. Festival organisers said they ""went above and beyond what was asked of us"". A spokesperson said: ""Because of these measures, over 450 people who would otherwise have been at risk of passing on the virus did not attend or left the festival early."" They added: ""We look forward to sharing our experience of running the festival in the current circumstances with other large events so we can all continue to provide much needed economic benefit to our wider communities and entertainment to our loyal audience.""

"Abattoirs, butchers and meat processors are set to employ prisoners and ex-inmates to help plug labour shortages. Meat industry leaders held talks with the government on Monday to discuss options of how businesses could link up with prisons to fill vacancies. The Association of Independent Meat Suppliers told the BBC the industry had about 14,000 job vacancies currently. It said Covid, Brexit and perceptions over career paths had caused a looming ""recruitment crisis"". The industry body said businesses would seek to link up with prisons that contain prisoners who are part of the Release On Temporary Licence (ROTL) programme. ROTL is a risk-assessed temporary release programme that inmates in open prisons use to gain work experience to help them in their transition back into the community. Tony Goodger, of the Association of Independent Meat Suppliers, said the industry body would contact members who required staff and work with the Ministry of Justice to put them in contact with prison services, in a bid to recruit people about to leave prison or current inmates. Mr Goodger said some members already employed inmates on ROTL, and had found them to be ""well behaved, hard-working, and willing to learn"". ""It's down to the members [who they employ],"" he said. ""They [prisons] have got offenders and prison-leavers, we have got members who need labour. It seems sensible to bring the two together."" Turkey processing giant Bernard Matthews has previously formed links with HMP Norwich and regularly visits the prison as part of its recruitment cycle, to assess candidates and offer inmates contracts to start upon release. Mr Goodger said that many prisons taught inmates food safety skills, which would aid them in finding work in the industry. ""We have suggested that they look at some of the other free training available such as the FSA's Allergen training and Vacuum Packing training, in order that offenders can leave prisons 'job ready',"" he added. The food manufacturing industry has also looked to employ former armed service personnel. However, the number of people taking up jobs has been low. The Covid pandemic and Brexit have both contributed to current worker shortages, with furloughed workers finding new jobs and EU nationals returning to their home countries. The British Meat Processors Association said the current level of vacancies represented about 15% of the industry's workforce. The industry body said its members were ""trying absolutely every avenue"" to recruit workers. The government recently announced the expansion of a kitchen training scheme across jails in England and Wales. The Clink Kitchens Scheme,externalsees prisoners train in professionally run prison kitchens for up to 35 hours a week while working towards professional qualifications to help them find employment on the outside. However, the food industry is not the only sector to witness a shortage of workers. A lack about 90,000 HGV drivers ""is placing increasingly unsustainable pressure on retailers and their supply chains"",according to lobby groups. In a letter to Kwasi Kwarteng, the business secretary, the British Retail Consortium (BRC) and freight trade group Logistics UK have warned that consumers will suffer unless the government intervenes. A Ministry of Justice spokesman said it would support ""all industries with skills shortages where possible"". ""Helping prisoners find jobs during their sentence and after release makes it much less likely they will reoffend,"" he added.

"This video can not be played The BBC's Lyse Doucet reports from Kabul airport, where many Afghans are fleeing the Taliban regime It hits you like a brick as soon as you put your foot on the tarmac at Kabul international airport. The intensity, the urgency, the darkness of this hour. In every direction, there are the huge grey military transport planes from the US and many other countries. Military helicopters are in the sky. Heading towards every single plane are long queues of Afghans. The lines don't seem to end. They have been told they can only bring one suitcase and the clothes they are wearing, as they leave their country behind - the country now controlled by the Taliban. But it's not just the country they are leaving. They are leaving behind the life they lived, and for the young educated generation, the life they built up, the dreams they cherished over 20 years. There are said to be 14,000 people inside this airfield, controlled by US military, waiting to board. Freelance journalist Bilal Sarwary was among those who made it onto the airfield, having left behind everything he had worked so hard to build, save for a few pairs of clothes and his young family.

You may want to readTwitterâs cookie policy,externalandprivacy policy,externalbefore accepting. To view this content chooseâaccept and continueâ. Sarwary, a former BBC journalist, had planned to raise his daughter - named Sola, meaning ""peace"" - in his home country, the place he has spent 20 years covering, starting as a fixer and translator in 2001. Instead, he is hoping she will one day understand the decision he has made to leave. ""Today's the day that a generation of Afghans have buried their dreams and aspirations and our lives,"" he said. ""This city to us is our home, despite its contradictions we called it home, we're raised from here. We hope the Taliban can learn from the lessons of the pastâ¦ and we can prove that we can move away from the tanks and bullets, towards a road where everyone can see themselves."" About 17,000 people have left Afghanistan via Kabul airport in the last week, according to the US. It is not known how many were Afghan citizens given visas for their work with international governments and organisations amid fears they may be targeted by the Taliban. Many are professionals and graduates, and Sarwary fears what this ""brain drain"" will mean for Afghanistan. Afghanistan, he said, was ""a country where good people, they don't grow on trees"". Outside the airport gates, there are another 10,000 or more hoping to get onto the airfield - a crush of people wanting to leave however they can. The longer it has taken, the more desperate the crowd has become. Reporters at the scene describe Saturday as one of the worst days, with several women known to have lost their lives as the people surged forward. According to Nato, they are among the at least 20 people who have died in and around the airport since the Taliban entered the city a week ago. Sunday was reported to be calmer at the gates, although witnesses report Taliban fighters firing into the air and using batons in order to keep people in line, according to news agency Reuters. Internationally, concerns continue to grow that countries will not be able to get their people - nationals and the Afghans who have worked alongside them - out before the end of the month, at which point the US has said it will pull out. On Saturday the European Union's foreign policy chief Josep Borrell warned that it was ""mathematically impossible"" to evacuate so many in the next nine days. As for Bilal Sarwary, he was adamant that just because he was leaving, it did not mean he was ready to give up. ""Our affair with Afghanistan is the affair of fatal love, no matter what happens we will never give up on it,"" he said.

"Lord Botham was appointed to the House of Lords in 2020 Ian Botham, the former England cricketer known for legendary clashes with Australia, has been appointed UK government trade envoy to the country. Lord Botham, along with Baroness Hoey and several MPs, have been made trade envoys to boost British business interests around the world. International trade secretary Liz Trusstweeted,externalthe former all-rounder would ""bat for UK business down under"".  Lord Botham reportedly once said ""Aussies are big and empty - just like the country"", whereas he was affectionately known in the country as Guy the Gorilla. He is one of 10 new trade envoys.  Baroness Hoey has been appointed to Ghana, while Stephen Timms MP has been assigned to Switzerland and Lichtenstein, and Sir Jeffrey Donaldson MP to Cameroon, in addition to his role as trade envoy to Egypt. David Mundell MP has been appointed to New Zealand, Mark Eastwood MP to Pakistan, Marco Longhi MP to Brazil and Conor Burns MP to Canada . Lord Walney has been assigned to Tanzania, while Felicity Buchan MP has been appointed to Iceland and Norway.  Lord Botham enjoyed Ashes success against Australia during his playing days Trade envoys are a network of parliamentarians drawn from across the political spectrum, who are appointed by the prime minister. They are unpaid, voluntary roles.  They engage with markets where substantial trade and investment opportunities have been identified by UK government. The government already has envoys in more than 60 countries. Lord Botham, who played 102 Test matches for England between 1977 and 1992, is an advocate of field sports and a prominent Brexit supporter who was knighted in 2007, in recognition of his services to charity and cricket. One of his most famous moments on the field came in 1981 when he inspired a sensational defeat of Australia. After retirement, he became a commentator and started his own wine label. He currently sits as a crossbench - independent - peer in the House of Lords. The UK and Australia recently agreed a free trade deal. The pact - the first to be built from scratch since the UK left the EU - covers British goods such as cars, Scotch whisky, biscuits and ceramics. However, some UK farmershave raised concerns they may be undercut on price and standards. International trade secretary Ms Truss said the trade envoys would play a ""key role"" in delivering the government's ""ambitious global trade agenda"". In 2020-21, trade envoys supported more than Â£16bn of UK exports, the government said.

Meanwhile, a further 40,345 first vaccine doses have been administered, as well as another 116,352 second doses. It means that 76.9% of over-16s in the UK have now been fully vaccinated, while 87.7% have had at least one dose. Reality Check As we reported earlier, coronavirus was the ninth biggest cause of death in England in July, up from the 26th most common cause in June. In Wales it was the 22nd leading cause of death, having been too low to rank the previous month. The total number of people dying rose back above the average levels for 2015 to 2019 in July. The number of deaths was 7.6% higher than average in England and 10.4% higher in Wales,figures from the Office for National Statistics,externalshow. Since the start of the pandemic in March 2020, Covid has been the number one cause of death in England and Wales for six months (April, May, November and December 2020 and January and February 2021). When there isn't a pandemic, the top causes of death are usually heart disease and dementia. The figures record the one condition named as the underlying cause of death. So, it does not include cases in which Covid was just mentioned on the death certificate as a contributory cause. They show the deaths registered in each period, not when the deaths actually occurred. Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst Thereâs a lot of focus in China today on one of the
countryâs top medical experts being cleared over academic misconduct. Zhang Wenhong is a renowned infectious disease expert who
is often nicknamed âChinaâs Dr Fauciâ. He is extremely popular in China
and has become of the countryâs most trusted voices on Covid-19. However, the national Global Times newspaper notes that
there were calls in early August to investigate his academic background, with
some on the popular Sina Weibo microblogclaiming that his doctorate paper showed signs of plagiarism.,external Fudan University, which is one of Chinaâs top universities,
subsequently said it would carry out an investigation into these claims, in
accordance with relevant academic standards. Today, the university has released the findings of these
results, and according to the national China Daily newspaper, has found that
âZhangâs doctoral dissertation had met the requirements for doctoral
dissertations at that timeâ. In a statement on its website,external, it says that his
work âdoes not constitute academic misconductâ. Given Dr Zhangâs popularity, many on Chinaâs Sina Weibo
social network are pleased with these results. Comments are rife on the
platform about how those that made âslanderousâ comments about him should
apologise or âbe held accountableâ for spreading online rumours. Global Times notes,externalthat recent criticism over Dr Zhang
might have been sparked by an early ""misinterpreted"" remark he had
made, that some saw as contradictory to China's official messaging on Covid-19. Cumbria's director of public health is urging tourists to take a lateral flow Covid test before visiting the county in north-west England. It follows a sharp increase in the number of coronavirus cases in the Eden district. There are now 387 cases per 100,000 people - double the number compared with the week before. Colin Cox says it is unclear whether tourism is a factor, but is urging people to check they are Covid-free before travelling and to continue wearing face coverings in public places. As we reported just now, police have been called to ITN's London headquarters after anti-vaccine protesters entered the building. We've got a bit more detail now from ITN. In a statement, a spokeswoman says police are attending a ""breach of security"" at its studios on Grays' Inn Road. ITN says it takes such breaches ""very seriously"" and that the safety of its staff and journalists is of ""paramount importance"". ""All personnel have been advised to either stay in the
building or stay away while the situation is being dealt with,"" the statement adds. Pfizer's two-dose Covid-19 vaccine has received full approval from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), becoming the first jab to be licensed in the US. The vaccine had initially been given emergency use authorisation. Its two jabs are now fully approved for those aged 16 and older. The approval is expected to set off more vaccine mandates by employers and organisations across the country. It comes amid lingering vaccine hesitancy among many Americans. In a statement, the FDA says its review for approval includes data from approximately 44,000 people. Acting FDA commissioner Janet Woodcock says that the public ""can be very confident"" the vaccine meets high safety, effectiveness and manufacturing quality standards. Read more on this story here. Abattoirs, butchers and meat processors are set to employ prisoners and ex-inmates to help plug 14,000 job vacancies. The Association of Independent Meat Suppliers (AIMS) tells the BBC that Covid has contributed to a looming ""recruitment crisis"". The industry body says businesses will seek to link up with prisons that contain prisoners who are part of the Release On Temporary Licence (ROTL) programme. It's a risk-assessed scheme that inmates in open prisons use to gain work experience to help them in their transition back into the community. Tony Goodger, from AIMS, says some members already employ inmates on ROTL, and have found them to be ""well behaved, hard-working, and willing to learn"". We've got more on this storyhere. A group of anti-vaccine protesters have entered ITN Production's London headquarters on Gray's Inn road, in Camden. In a statement posted on Twitter on Monday,external- and subsequently retweeted by ITN - the Metropolitan Police said officers were ""responding to a demonstration at a private premises on Grayâs Inn Road...where people have unlawfully gained access to the building"" and that police were ""engaging with building security and removing those who have gained entry"".

A Covid vaccination clinic that had to close because of an anti-vaccine protest will reopen later this week. The pop-up clinic inside Cabot Circus Shopping Centre in Bristol was shut when about 60 protesters gathered outside on Sunday afternoon. Avon and Somerset Police says the clinic closed ""for the welfare and safety of staff and patients"". In a statement, the NHS said it was ""disappointed"" that vaccinations had to be paused. Some of the protesters addressed shoppers outside the clinic using a megaphone, telling them not to get the vaccine. The pop-up clinic is due to re-open to people aged 16 and over on 27 and 28 August from 11:00 to 19:00 BST. Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst Chinaâs capital city Beijing has today relaxed
its remaining local lockdowns, meaning that life is somewhat back to normal for residents. There were fears of a widespread outbreak in
Beijing after a local case of Covid-19 was detected in the city on 28 July. Sporadic cases were subsequently reported, meaning that the city swiftly locked
down communities where people had tested positive, andimposed travel restrictions on people entering and leaving the city.,external Large-scale testing drives,externalinvolving millions of
people also took place. Almost three weeks ago, the cityâs government stressed that
all large-scale events throughout August should be cancelled,including the Beijing International Film Festival,external. Parks, cinemas and libraries were told to limit the number of visitors, and
many universities, including the prestigious Tsinghua University, announced
that they were suspending the start date of their new terms. But Beijing - which has population of around 21 million people - has not recorded any new symptomatic cases since 11 August,according to the official Xinhua News Agency,external, so the city has deemed it safe to lift its lockdowns. So we know that another 35m Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines are on order, on top of the 100m that have already been used or are on the way already - but who are they earmarked for? Because Prizer was the first vaccine to become available for use in the UK, that is what was given to the elderly and most vulnerable who were prioritised when the vaccine rollout started last December. Oxford-AstraZeneca was the second to be approved and because it was quickly available in particularly large numbers, it became the predominant vaccine as the UK rollout started to work down the age groups. But when rare instances of blood clots in younger people were linked to the AstraZeneca jab, under-30s were told they wouild be offered Pfizer or Moderna vaccines rather than the AstraZeneca one. Since then the AstraZeneca vaccine has been largely used for the second vaccines of those people who were given that first time around. The UK regulator has now approved the use of thePfizer-BioNTech vaccine in children aged 12-15and the UK's vaccines committee will now decide whether children should get the jab. The UK's booster programme is due to start next monthbut no decision has been announced on whether this third jab must match someone's first or second jab. If that is what is decided, then Pfizer will be used to boost the immunity of the elderly and vulnerable groups who were first to receive it at the end of 2020 and start of this year. If you're just joining us, here's a quick round-up of the main headlines this lunchtime: Back to our main news that the UK has ordered another35m coronavirus vaccines from Pfizer-BioNTech.,external That's on top of an extra 60 million doses of the same jab it ordered in April as part of the vaccination booster programme in the autumn. This extra order means that Pfizer has now pulled well clear of the Oxford Astra-Zeneca vaccine that at one stage made up the biggest part of the government's pre-orders. The latest order count for each vaccine from the very start of the pandemic is: Add those figures up and the total is several times the entire population of the UK but of course some of those vaccines have yet to be approved for use in this country. You may remember that at the end of last year, before a single vaccine was produced, the government took an early approach of exploring as many avenues as possible in terms of immunisation options..  You can read more about the UK's vaccine programmehere. As we've been reporting today, a new NHS video featuring people in their 20s and 30s who suffer from long Covid is being used as part of effortsto encourage young people to get vaccinated. Infection rates are currently highest among younger adults, but so too is vaccine hesitancy, according to BBC health correspondent Dominic Hughes. Dr Joanne Herman, a consultant in infectious diseases, urges young people to get vaccinated against Covid to protect their long-term health. ""Adults may be unable to work, but children will be prevented from learning and I think it's such an important time, you don't want months in bed, you don't want months when you're unable to do your sport or go out dancing or do anything you want, you want to be in the prime of your life."" Staff and supply shortages have taken their toll on the UK's economic recovery this month, according to a closely watched survey. The IHS Markit/CIPS Composite Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) for August hit a six-month low of 55.3, falling from 59.2 in July. Any reading above 50 indicates growth, but the bounce-back from the pandemic is losing momentum, say researchers. Firms have complained that self-isolation requirements for contacts of people with Covid havemade it hard for them to maintain staffing levels. IHS Markit economist Chris Williamson says: ""Despite Covid-19 containment measures easing to the lowest since the pandemic began, rising virus case numbers are deterring many forms of spending, notably by consumers, and have hit growth via worsening staff and supply shortages."" He says supplier delays have risen to a degree exceeded only once before - in the initial months of the pandemic. ""The number of companies reporting that output had fallen due to staff or materials shortages has risenfar above anything ever seen previouslyin more than 20 years of survey history,"" Williamson adds. BBC MonitoringThe world through its media The Zimbabwe Congress of Trade Unions (ZCTU) has sued several companies for ordering employees to receive Covid-19 vaccines or risk the sack. In an urgent courtfiling cited,externalby privately-owned ZimLive website, ZCTU said the actions of the companies violated workersâ constitutional rights. âThere is no law in Zimbabwe making vaccination compulsory. Each person, having fully considered the implications and effects of vaccination, is expected to make a personal decision on whether or not to get vaccinated,â ZCTU argues in the court application. Public Service Minister Paul Mavhima and Attorney General Prince Machaya are also enjoined in the case. The Zimbabwe government, which has ordered all civil servants to get vaccinated, is targeting to inoculate at least 10 million of its approximately 15 million citizens by the end of this year. People have been working out longer and can fit exercise into their daily routine better since the start of the pandemic, industry figures show. PureGym's one million members now visit 1.43 times a week on average, compared with 1.21 before lockdown, while the 17:00-20:00 peak has ""quietened down"". Visits are also now spread across the day and later into the evening. And personal trainer Harley Edwards says she has seen a change, with 100 of her 150 clients exercising solely online. She started an online class in February 2020 and, after lockdown a month later, numbers watching soared to 300. She says about 80% of her clients are mums who are now able to fit working out around their lifestyle better - logging on before or after work, or when childcare allows. ""I have members of my online group who had never exercised in their lives until lockdown, and now they would never give it up,""Harley says. BBC MonitoringThe world through its media Iran has recorded a further 38,657 positive cases and 610 Covid-related deaths, the country's health ministry says. New infections have risen slightly on Sunday's figure (36,419) but deaths have fallen from the 684 deaths reported yesterday. A further 5,108 people have been hospitalised. A total of 3,961,024 have recovered, while 7,695 patients are in critical condition. The ministry also says that 16,986,882 people have received at least one dose of a vaccine, while 6,150,817 people have received two doses, bringing the total number of administered doses to 23,137,699. James GallagherHealth and science correspondent, BBC News There are marked differences in your immune system after a natural infection with coronavirus and after vaccination. Which is better? It is now a serious question that has implications for whether children should ever be vaccinated. And whether we use the virus or booster shots to top up immunity in adults. Both have become contentious issues. ""We could be digging ourselves into a hole, for a very long time, where we think we can only keep Covid away by boosting every year,"" Prof Eleanor Riley, an immunologist from the University of Edinburgh, tells me. Prof Adam Finn, a government vaccine adviser, says over-vaccinating people, when other parts of the world had none, is ""a bit insane, it's not just inequitable, it's stupid"". I've spoken to experts to compare vaccine and natural infection with the virus -here's what they told me. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Lord Botham was appointed to the House of Lords in 2020 Ian Botham, the former England cricketer known for legendary clashes with Australia, has been appointed UK government trade envoy to the country. Lord Botham, along with Baroness Hoey and several MPs, have been made trade envoys to boost British business interests around the world. International trade secretary Liz Trusstweeted,externalthe former all-rounder would ""bat for UK business down under"".  Lord Botham reportedly once said ""Aussies are big and empty - just like the country"", whereas he was affectionately known in the country as Guy the Gorilla. He is one of 10 new trade envoys.  Baroness Hoey has been appointed to Ghana, while Stephen Timms MP has been assigned to Switzerland and Lichtenstein, and Sir Jeffrey Donaldson MP to Cameroon, in addition to his role as trade envoy to Egypt. David Mundell MP has been appointed to New Zealand, Mark Eastwood MP to Pakistan, Marco Longhi MP to Brazil and Conor Burns MP to Canada . Lord Walney has been assigned to Tanzania, while Felicity Buchan MP has been appointed to Iceland and Norway.  Lord Botham enjoyed Ashes success against Australia during his playing days Trade envoys are a network of parliamentarians drawn from across the political spectrum, who are appointed by the prime minister. They are unpaid, voluntary roles.  They engage with markets where substantial trade and investment opportunities have been identified by UK government. The government already has envoys in more than 60 countries. Lord Botham, who played 102 Test matches for England between 1977 and 1992, is an advocate of field sports and a prominent Brexit supporter who was knighted in 2007, in recognition of his services to charity and cricket. One of his most famous moments on the field came in 1981 when he inspired a sensational defeat of Australia. After retirement, he became a commentator and started his own wine label. He currently sits as a crossbench - independent - peer in the House of Lords. The UK and Australia recently agreed a free trade deal. The pact - the first to be built from scratch since the UK left the EU - covers British goods such as cars, Scotch whisky, biscuits and ceramics. However, some UK farmershave raised concerns they may be undercut on price and standards. International trade secretary Ms Truss said the trade envoys would play a ""key role"" in delivering the government's ""ambitious global trade agenda"". In 2020-21, trade envoys supported more than Â£16bn of UK exports, the government said.

"This video can not be played Long Covid means brushing my hair can be ""emotionally traumatising"", says Megan Higgins Young people have shared stories of the debilitating effects of long Covid as they urge others to get jabbed. A new NHS video features the experiences of three previously healthy people as part of a drive to encourage vaccine uptake. Quincy Dwamena, 31, said he delayed his jab and ""ended up being hospitalised and thought I was going to die"". It comes as the government says it has met itstarget of offering all 16 and 17-year-olds in England a Covid jab. More than 360,000 people in this age group in England have now been given a first dose of the vaccine. They are being invited to book an appointment with their GP or visit a walk-in centre. In thevideo to encourage young people to get vaccinated,,externalMr Dwamena, from East London, described himself as a ""healthy young guy"" who ""went to the gym often"" and delayed getting the vaccine and became seriously ill. He said: ""My advice is to get the vaccine: don't put yourself and others at risk, I wish I'd got mine as soon as it was offered."" What do young people need to know about the vaccine? Should all children get a vaccine? How many people have been vaccinated so far? What are the symptoms of long Covid? Megan Higgins, 25, and Ella Harwood, 23, were both previously healthy and active but are now suffering with extreme fatigue due to long Covid. Ms Higgins, a special needs tutor from London, said that eight months on she still ""can't even walk around the shops without getting exhausted"". She told BBC Breakfast on bad days she experiences all over joint pain and ""that feeling of being absolutely exhausted from when you wake up to when you go to sleep"". ""One of the things I really notice is my emotional resilienceâ¦ when you're that tired everything hits you so much harder,"" she said. ""I had a knot at the end of my hair and trying to comb it out I remember getting so upset because I couldn't keep my hands above my head long enough to pick at the knot. ""I remember getting so frustrated that I wasn't strong enough to do it. I wasn't aware enough or awake enough. Something as silly as brushing your hair out can be emotionally really quite traumatising."" She said it was ""definitely worth getting the coronavirus vaccine... because the long-term effects can be more devastating than the actual short-term virus for some people."" ""For about seven months solid I genuinely thought I might die that year,"" says Ella Harwood Ms Harwood, an illustrator from London, said she was bed-bound for seven months and fears she will ""never be the same again"". She said: ""I was fit and healthy I had literally no conditions. I was doing exercise and for about seven months solid and I genuinely though I might die that year."" She added: ""My advice to anyone really, young and old, would be to get the vaccine because it's a naive way of thinking that you're invincible just because you're fit and healthy and you eat the right stuff."" This video can not be played Itâs been more than a year, will I ever recover? - BBC reporter Lucy Adams explored long Covid in a Panorama film The Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) said more than a million letters and texts were sent out in the three weekssince the age group became eligible for a jab. All those aged 12 to 15 and considered at-risk in England have also been invited for a vaccination, the government said. Letters have been sent to all 16 and 17 year olds in Wales inviting them for their jab. In Scotland, everyone aged 16 and overcan register to get the vaccine on the NHS inform website,externalor by calling 0800 030 8013. In Northern Ireland, older teenagers canbook online,externalor call 0300 200 7813. Walk-in centres are also open. According to thelatest figures,external, more than 47.6 million people in the UK - about 87% of over-16s - have now received at least one vaccine, with more than 41.6 million - 76% - having had both jabs. On Sunday 32,253 new Covid cases were reported across the UK, as well as a further 49 deaths within 28 days of a positive test. While the younger a person is the lower their overall risk from coronavirus, young adults can still get long Covid - which is when symptoms of the disease persist for an extended period. The latest figures for England show people aged 18 to 34 now make up more than a fifth of those admitted to hospital with the virus, four times higher than at the peak last winter, and most of those are unvaccinated. 'Harrowing stories' Having two doses of the vaccine approximately halves the risk of experiencing symptoms which last more than 28 days after becoming infected, according to research from King's College London. Health Secretary Sajid Javid said: ""Regardless of whether you're young, fit and healthy, these harrowing stories really show that Covid-19 can affect anyone. ""I encourage everyone to come forward for both their jabs as quickly as possible as vaccines are the best way to protect yourself and your loved ones from serious illness."" The government has been pushing to increase vaccine uptake among young people, with companies such as Asda and Deliveroooffering incentivesto those who get a jab. Meanwhile, pop-up vaccine sites have been opened across the country at sites such as London-based nightclub Heaven, as well as football stadiums and festivals.

"Angela Merkel sought to reassure Ukraine's Volodymyr Zelensky over the Russian-led Nord Stream 2 project German Chancellor Angela Merkel has said further sanctions may be imposed on Russia if it uses a controversial gas pipeline against Ukraine. Mrs Merkel, on her final visit to Kyiv before leaving office, told Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky she understood his concerns over the Nord Stream 2 project. Mr Zelensky opposes the pipeline, which he says threatens Ukraine's security. It will run under the Baltic Sea and double Russian gas exports to Germany. Ukraine fears that the Russian-led Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline will tighten Moscow's grip over the region's energy supply and strengthen its influence. During a joint press conference on Sunday, Mr Zelensky described the project as a ""geopolitical weapon of the Kremlin"", which he said would be ""dangerous for all of Europe"". But Mrs Merkel, who is standing down as Germany's chancellor this autumn after 16 years in office, said Berlin agreed with Washington that Nord Stream 2 should not be used against Ukraine. She said sanctions could be used against Moscow under an agreement between Germany and the US, if gas was ""used as a weapon"". Mr Zelensky said he was concerned about what would happen in three years when the contract to deliver Russian gas through Ukrainian pipelines runs out. The loss of billions of dollars in transit fees would hit Ukraine's economy hard. Mrs Merkel, who held talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin on Friday, promised to provide more than a billion dollars to help expand Ukraine's renewable energy sector. Russia already supplies about 40% of the EU's gas - just ahead of Norway, which is not in the EU but takes part in its single market. The new pipeline will increase the amount of gas going under the Baltic to 55 billion cubic metres per year. Mrs Merkel has tried to assure Central and Eastern European states that the pipeline would not make Germany reliant on Russia for energy.

Meanwhile, a further 40,345 first vaccine doses have been administered, as well as another 116,352 second doses. It means that 76.9% of over-16s in the UK have now been fully vaccinated, while 87.7% have had at least one dose. Reality Check As we reported earlier, coronavirus was the ninth biggest cause of death in England in July, up from the 26th most common cause in June. In Wales it was the 22nd leading cause of death, having been too low to rank the previous month. The total number of people dying rose back above the average levels for 2015 to 2019 in July.

results, and according to the national China Daily newspaper, has found that
âZhangâs doctoral dissertation had met the requirements for doctoral
dissertations at that timeâ. In a statement on its website,external, it says that his
work âdoes not constitute academic misconductâ. Given Dr Zhangâs popularity, many on Chinaâs Sina Weibo

A Covid vaccination clinic that had to close because of an anti-vaccine protest will reopen later this week.

Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst Chinaâs capital city Beijing has today relaxed
its remaining local lockdowns, meaning that life is somewhat back to normal for residents. There were fears of a widespread outbreak in
Beijing after a local case of Covid-19 was detected in the city on 28 July. Sporadic cases were subsequently reported, meaning that the city swiftly locked
down communities where people had tested positive, andimposed travel restrictions on people entering and leaving the city.,external Large-scale testing drives,externalinvolving millions of
people also took place. Almost three weeks ago, the cityâs government stressed that
all large-scale events throughout August should be cancelled,including the Beijing International Film Festival,external. Parks, cinemas and libraries were told to limit the number of visitors, and
many universities, including the prestigious Tsinghua University, announced
that they were suspending the start date of their new terms. But Beijing - which has population of around 21 million people - has not recorded any new symptomatic cases since 11 August,according to the official Xinhua News Agency,external, so the city has deemed it safe to lift its lockdowns. So we know that another 35m Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines are on order, on top of the 100m that have already been used or are on the way already - but who are they earmarked for? Because Prizer was the first vaccine to become available for use in the UK, that is what was given to the elderly and most vulnerable who were prioritised when the vaccine rollout started last December. Oxford-AstraZeneca was the second to be approved and because it was quickly available in particularly large numbers, it became the predominant vaccine as the UK rollout started to work down the age groups. But when rare instances of blood clots in younger people were linked to the AstraZeneca jab, under-30s were told they wouild be offered Pfizer or Moderna vaccines rather than the AstraZeneca one. Since then the AstraZeneca vaccine has been largely used for the second vaccines of those people who were given that first time around. The UK regulator has now approved the use of thePfizer-BioNTech vaccine in children aged 12-15and the UK's vaccines committee will now decide whether children should get the jab. The UK's booster programme is due to start next monthbut no decision has been announced on whether this third jab must match someone's first or second jab. If that is what is decided, then Pfizer will be used to boost the immunity of the elderly and vulnerable groups who were first to receive it at the end of 2020 and start of this year. If you're just joining us, here's a quick round-up of the main headlines this lunchtime: Back to our main news that the UK has ordered another35m coronavirus vaccines from Pfizer-BioNTech.,external That's on top of an extra 60 million doses of the same jab it ordered in April as part of the vaccination booster programme in the autumn. This extra order means that Pfizer has now pulled well clear of the Oxford Astra-Zeneca vaccine that at one stage made up the biggest part of the government's pre-orders. The latest order count for each vaccine from the very start of the pandemic is: Add those figures up and the total is several times the entire population of the UK but of course some of those vaccines have yet to be approved for use in this country. You may remember that at the end of last year, before a single vaccine was produced, the government took an early approach of exploring as many avenues as possible in terms of immunisation options..  You can read more about the UK's vaccine programmehere. As we've been reporting today, a new NHS video featuring people in their 20s and 30s who suffer from long Covid is being used as part of effortsto encourage young people to get vaccinated. Infection rates are currently highest among younger adults, but so too is vaccine hesitancy, according to BBC health correspondent Dominic Hughes. Dr Joanne Herman, a consultant in infectious diseases, urges young people to get vaccinated against Covid to protect their long-term health. ""Adults may be unable to work, but children will be prevented from learning and I think it's such an important time, you don't want months in bed, you don't want months when you're unable to do your sport or go out dancing or do anything you want, you want to be in the prime of your life."" Staff and supply shortages have taken their toll on the UK's economic recovery this month, according to a closely watched survey. The IHS Markit/CIPS Composite Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) for August hit a six-month low of 55.3, falling from 59.2 in July. Any reading above 50 indicates growth, but the bounce-back from the pandemic is losing momentum, say researchers. Firms have complained that self-isolation requirements for contacts of people with Covid havemade it hard for them to maintain staffing levels. IHS Markit economist Chris Williamson says: ""Despite Covid-19 containment measures easing to the lowest since the pandemic began, rising virus case numbers are deterring many forms of spending, notably by consumers, and have hit growth via worsening staff and supply shortages."" He says supplier delays have risen to a degree exceeded only once before - in the initial months of the pandemic. ""The number of companies reporting that output had fallen due to staff or materials shortages has risenfar above anything ever seen previouslyin more than 20 years of survey history,"" Williamson adds. BBC MonitoringThe world through its media The Zimbabwe Congress of Trade Unions (ZCTU) has sued several companies for ordering employees to receive Covid-19 vaccines or risk the sack. In an urgent courtfiling cited,externalby privately-owned ZimLive website, ZCTU said the actions of the companies violated workersâ constitutional rights. âThere is no law in Zimbabwe making vaccination compulsory. Each person, having fully considered the implications and effects of vaccination, is expected to make a personal decision on whether or not to get vaccinated,â ZCTU argues in the court application. Public Service Minister Paul Mavhima and Attorney General Prince Machaya are also enjoined in the case. The Zimbabwe government, which has ordered all civil servants to get vaccinated, is targeting to inoculate at least 10 million of its approximately 15 million citizens by the end of this year. People have been working out longer and can fit exercise into their daily routine better since the start of the pandemic, industry figures show. PureGym's one million members now visit 1.43 times a week on average, compared with 1.21 before lockdown, while the 17:00-20:00 peak has ""quietened down"". Visits are also now spread across the day and later into the evening. And personal trainer Harley Edwards says she has seen a change, with 100 of her 150 clients exercising solely online. She started an online class in February 2020 and, after lockdown a month later, numbers watching soared to 300. She says about 80% of her clients are mums who are now able to fit working out around their lifestyle better - logging on before or after work, or when childcare allows. ""I have members of my online group who had never exercised in their lives until lockdown, and now they would never give it up,""Harley says. BBC MonitoringThe world through its media Iran has recorded a further 38,657 positive cases and 610 Covid-related deaths, the country's health ministry says. New infections have risen slightly on Sunday's figure (36,419) but deaths have fallen from the 684 deaths reported yesterday. A further 5,108 people have been hospitalised. A total of 3,961,024 have recovered, while 7,695 patients are in critical condition. The ministry also says that 16,986,882 people have received at least one dose of a vaccine, while 6,150,817 people have received two doses, bringing the total number of administered doses to 23,137,699. James GallagherHealth and science correspondent, BBC News There are marked differences in your immune system after a natural infection with coronavirus and after vaccination. Which is better? It is now a serious question that has implications for whether children should ever be vaccinated. And whether we use the virus or booster shots to top up immunity in adults. Both have become contentious issues. ""We could be digging ourselves into a hole, for a very long time, where we think we can only keep Covid away by boosting every year,"" Prof Eleanor Riley, an immunologist from the University of Edinburgh, tells me. Prof Adam Finn, a government vaccine adviser, says over-vaccinating people, when other parts of the world had none, is ""a bit insane, it's not just inequitable, it's stupid"". I've spoken to experts to compare vaccine and natural infection with the virus -here's what they told me. Â© 2025 BBC.

""Adults may be unable to work, but children will be prevented from learning and I think it's such an important time, you don't want months in bed, you don't want months when you're unable to do your sport or go out dancing or do anything you want, you want to be in the prime of your life."" Staff and supply shortages have taken their toll on the UK's economic recovery this month, according to a closely watched survey. The IHS Markit/CIPS Composite Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) for August hit a six-month low of 55.3, falling from 59.2 in July. Any reading above 50 indicates growth, but the bounce-back from the pandemic is losing momentum, say researchers. Firms have complained that self-isolation requirements for contacts of people with Covid havemade it hard for them to maintain staffing levels. IHS Markit economist Chris Williamson says: ""Despite Covid-19 containment measures easing to the lowest since the pandemic began, rising virus case numbers are deterring many forms of spending, notably by consumers, and have hit growth via worsening staff and supply shortages."" He says supplier delays have risen to a degree exceeded only once before - in the initial months of the pandemic. ""The number of companies reporting that output had fallen due to staff or materials shortages has risenfar above anything ever seen previouslyin more than 20 years of survey history,"" Williamson adds. BBC MonitoringThe world through its media The Zimbabwe Congress of Trade Unions (ZCTU) has sued several companies for ordering employees to receive Covid-19 vaccines or risk the sack. In an urgent courtfiling cited,externalby privately-owned ZimLive website, ZCTU said the actions of the companies violated workersâ constitutional rights. âThere is no law in Zimbabwe making vaccination compulsory. Each person, having fully considered the implications and effects of vaccination, is expected to make a personal decision on whether or not to get vaccinated,â ZCTU argues in the court application. Public Service Minister Paul Mavhima and Attorney General Prince Machaya are also enjoined in the case. The Zimbabwe government, which has ordered all civil servants to get vaccinated, is targeting to inoculate at least 10 million of its approximately 15 million citizens by the end of this year. People have been working out longer and can fit exercise into their daily routine better since the start of the pandemic, industry figures show. PureGym's one million members now visit 1.43 times a week on average, compared with 1.21 before lockdown, while the 17:00-20:00 peak has ""quietened down"". Visits are also now spread across the day and later into the evening. And personal trainer Harley Edwards says she has seen a change, with 100 of her 150 clients exercising solely online. She started an online class in February 2020 and, after lockdown a month later, numbers watching soared to 300. She says about 80% of her clients are mums who are now able to fit working out around their lifestyle better - logging on before or after work, or when childcare allows. ""I have members of my online group who had never exercised in their lives until lockdown, and now they would never give it up,""Harley says. BBC MonitoringThe world through its media Iran has recorded a further 38,657 positive cases and 610 Covid-related deaths, the country's health ministry says. New infections have risen slightly on Sunday's figure (36,419) but deaths have fallen from the 684 deaths reported yesterday. A further 5,108 people have been hospitalised. A total of 3,961,024 have recovered, while 7,695 patients are in critical condition. The ministry also says that 16,986,882 people have received at least one dose of a vaccine, while 6,150,817 people have received two doses, bringing the total number of administered doses to 23,137,699. James GallagherHealth and science correspondent, BBC News There are marked differences in your immune system after a natural infection with coronavirus and after vaccination. Which is better? It is now a serious question that has implications for whether children should ever be vaccinated. And whether we use the virus or booster shots to top up immunity in adults. Both have become contentious issues. ""We could be digging ourselves into a hole, for a very long time, where we think we can only keep Covid away by boosting every year,"" Prof Eleanor Riley, an immunologist from the University of Edinburgh, tells me. Prof Adam Finn, a government vaccine adviser, says over-vaccinating people, when other parts of the world had none, is ""a bit insane, it's not just inequitable, it's stupid"". I've spoken to experts to compare vaccine and natural infection with the virus -here's what they told me. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Lord Botham was appointed to the House of Lords in 2020 Ian Botham, the former England cricketer known for legendary clashes with Australia, has been appointed UK government trade envoy to the country. Lord Botham, along with Baroness Hoey and several MPs, have been made trade envoys to boost British business interests around the world. International trade secretary Liz Trusstweeted,externalthe former all-rounder would ""bat for UK business down under"".  Lord Botham reportedly once said ""Aussies are big and empty - just like the country"", whereas he was affectionately known in the country as Guy the Gorilla. He is one of 10 new trade envoys.  Baroness Hoey has been appointed to Ghana, while Stephen Timms MP has been assigned to Switzerland and Lichtenstein, and Sir Jeffrey Donaldson MP to Cameroon, in addition to his role as trade envoy to Egypt. David Mundell MP has been appointed to New Zealand, Mark Eastwood MP to Pakistan, Marco Longhi MP to Brazil and Conor Burns MP to Canada . Lord Walney has been assigned to Tanzania, while Felicity Buchan MP has been appointed to Iceland and Norway.  Lord Botham enjoyed Ashes success against Australia during his playing days Trade envoys are a network of parliamentarians drawn from across the political spectrum, who are appointed by the prime minister. They are unpaid, voluntary roles.  They engage with markets where substantial trade and investment opportunities have been identified by UK government. The government already has envoys in more than 60 countries. Lord Botham, who played 102 Test matches for England between 1977 and 1992, is an advocate of field sports and a prominent Brexit supporter who was knighted in 2007, in recognition of his services to charity and cricket. One of his most famous moments on the field came in 1981 when he inspired a sensational defeat of Australia. After retirement, he became a commentator and started his own wine label. He currently sits as a crossbench - independent - peer in the House of Lords. The UK and Australia recently agreed a free trade deal. The pact - the first to be built from scratch since the UK left the EU - covers British goods such as cars, Scotch whisky, biscuits and ceramics. However, some UK farmershave raised concerns they may be undercut on price and standards. International trade secretary Ms Truss said the trade envoys would play a ""key role"" in delivering the government's ""ambitious global trade agenda"". In 2020-21, trade envoys supported more than Â£16bn of UK exports, the government said.

"Jagtar Singh Johal, from Dumbarton, is being held under India's anti-terror law First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has called on the UK's foreign secretary to meet the family of a man held in an Indian prison for almost four years. Jagtar Singh Johal, from Dumbarton, is being held under India's anti-terror laws, accused of conspiring to murder a number of right-wing Hindu leaders. Mr Johal has previously said via his lawyer he had been ""falsely implicated"" and tortured into making a confession. Ms Sturgeon said she was concerned about his detention without trial. In her letter to Dominic Raab, she also said she was ""deeply concerned"" about allegations of torture and mistreatment of Mr Johal while in custody. Brit 'tortured to sign blank confession' in India The Indian authorities strongly deny the allegations and have said ""there is no evidence of mistreatment or torture as alleged"". Mr Johal travelled to India from Scotland in October 2017 for his wedding. Videos of the occasion show the new groom jumping enthusiastically to Bhangra music as he celebrated. Jagtar got married in India in 2017 But a fortnight later, while on a shopping trip with his new bride in the North Indian state of Punjab, Mr Johal was taken away by police and has been in detention ever since. His brother Gurpreet, who lives in Scotland, says Mr Johal was a peaceful activist and is convinced he was arrested because he had written about historical human rights violations against Sikhs in India. Gurpreet Singh Johal met Ms Sturgeon earlier this month to ask for her support. The first minister's letter to Mr Raab said Gurpreet was disappointed with the support from the Foreign Office and that he could not get a meeting with the foreign secretary. UK Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab has raised the case with his Indian counterpart Ms Sturgeon asked Mr Raab to ""personally"" meet the family of Mr Johal to hear their concerns and provide assurances of adequate assistance. She also asked him to raise the allegations of torture and the importance of a fair trial with the Indian authorities. Gurpreet Singh Johal said he last spoke to his brother, who is being held in Delhi's maximum security Tihar jail, about three weeks ago. He said Mr Johal was in ""good spirits"" but was concerned at the delays to his case. Gurpreet Singh Johal met Nicola Sturgeon last week Gurpreet Johal said he was grateful to finally meet Ms Sturgeon after his brother had been detained for almost four years. Of the UK government, he said: ""It is disappointing that a British national is being detained in an Indian jail for 1,380 days and they have still not called for his release."" Charge-sheets from the Indian authorities outline the case against Mr Johal and a group of men whom they believe were involved in a ""series of killings"" of right wing Hindu leaders. It is claimed Mr Johal was a member of Khalistan Liberation Front (KLF), described in the documents as an international ""terrorist gang"". He is accused of paying Â£3,000 to the former head of the KLF to help fund the crimes. The documents claim he ""actively participated and had complete knowledge of the conspiracy"". ""There are very serious charges against him including murder and abetment of terrorism,"" an Indian government official told the BBC. ""The seriousness of charges against him have been shared with the British authorities,"" they added. Mr Johal has been represented by the human rights organisation Reprieve since last year. Hundreds of people have protested outside the Foreign Office Its Deputy Director Harriet McCulloch told the BBC he had been ""failed"" by the UK government. She said: ""He's arbitrarily detained and he's facing the death penalty in relation to charges that have been brought on the basis of a torture confession. ""The UK government has a stated domestic policy of calling for the release of people like Jagtar who are being arbitrarily detained or held on no legal basis so it's the UK government's obligation to call for his release."" ""The UK [government] has so far failed to get any results for Jagtar and his family."" Ms McCulloch also criticised Prime Minister Boris Johnson for not raising Mr Johal's case at a meeting with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi earlier this year. A spokesman for the Foreign Office said: ""We have consistently raised our concerns about Mr Johal's case with the government of India, including his allegations of torture and mistreatment and his right to a fair trial. ""In-person consular visits in India are currently suspended due to the coronavirus pandemic. However, consular staff have regular telephone calls with Mr Johal in lieu of visits.""

Thanks for joining us, we'll be back tomorrow morning. Here's a recap of the day's main Covid news: The UK has recorded a further 31,914 new Covid-19 cases,Monday's official figures show.,external There have also been a further 40 deaths within 28 days of a positive test. Meanwhile, a further 40,345 first vaccine doses have been administered, as well as another 116,352 second doses. It means that 76.9% of over-16s in the UK have now been fully vaccinated, while 87.7% have had at least one dose. Reality Check As we reported earlier, coronavirus was the ninth biggest cause of death in England in July, up from the 26th most common cause in June. In Wales it was the 22nd leading cause of death, having been too low to rank the previous month. The total number of people dying rose back above the average levels for 2015 to 2019 in July. The number of deaths was 7.6% higher than average in England and 10.4% higher in Wales,figures from the Office for National Statistics,externalshow. Since the start of the pandemic in March 2020, Covid has been the number one cause of death in England and Wales for six months (April, May, November and December 2020 and January and February 2021). When there isn't a pandemic, the top causes of death are usually heart disease and dementia. The figures record the one condition named as the underlying cause of death. So, it does not include cases in which Covid was just mentioned on the death certificate as a contributory cause. They show the deaths registered in each period, not when the deaths actually occurred. Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst Thereâs a lot of focus in China today on one of the
countryâs top medical experts being cleared over academic misconduct. Zhang Wenhong is a renowned infectious disease expert who
is often nicknamed âChinaâs Dr Fauciâ. He is extremely popular in China
and has become of the countryâs most trusted voices on Covid-19. However, the national Global Times newspaper notes that
there were calls in early August to investigate his academic background, with
some on the popular Sina Weibo microblogclaiming that his doctorate paper showed signs of plagiarism.,external Fudan University, which is one of Chinaâs top universities,
subsequently said it would carry out an investigation into these claims, in
accordance with relevant academic standards. Today, the university has released the findings of these
results, and according to the national China Daily newspaper, has found that
âZhangâs doctoral dissertation had met the requirements for doctoral
dissertations at that timeâ. In a statement on its website,external, it says that his
work âdoes not constitute academic misconductâ. Given Dr Zhangâs popularity, many on Chinaâs Sina Weibo
social network are pleased with these results. Comments are rife on the
platform about how those that made âslanderousâ comments about him should
apologise or âbe held accountableâ for spreading online rumours. Global Times notes,externalthat recent criticism over Dr Zhang
might have been sparked by an early ""misinterpreted"" remark he had
made, that some saw as contradictory to China's official messaging on Covid-19. Cumbria's director of public health is urging tourists to take a lateral flow Covid test before visiting the county in north-west England. It follows a sharp increase in the number of coronavirus cases in the Eden district. There are now 387 cases per 100,000 people - double the number compared with the week before. Colin Cox says it is unclear whether tourism is a factor, but is urging people to check they are Covid-free before travelling and to continue wearing face coverings in public places. As we reported just now, police have been called to ITN's London headquarters after anti-vaccine protesters entered the building. We've got a bit more detail now from ITN. In a statement, a spokeswoman says police are attending a ""breach of security"" at its studios on Grays' Inn Road. ITN says it takes such breaches ""very seriously"" and that the safety of its staff and journalists is of ""paramount importance"". ""All personnel have been advised to either stay in the
building or stay away while the situation is being dealt with,"" the statement adds. Pfizer's two-dose Covid-19 vaccine has received full approval from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), becoming the first jab to be licensed in the US. The vaccine had initially been given emergency use authorisation. Its two jabs are now fully approved for those aged 16 and older. The approval is expected to set off more vaccine mandates by employers and organisations across the country. It comes amid lingering vaccine hesitancy among many Americans. In a statement, the FDA says its review for approval includes data from approximately 44,000 people. Acting FDA commissioner Janet Woodcock says that the public ""can be very confident"" the vaccine meets high safety, effectiveness and manufacturing quality standards. Read more on this story here. Abattoirs, butchers and meat processors are set to employ prisoners and ex-inmates to help plug 14,000 job vacancies. The Association of Independent Meat Suppliers (AIMS) tells the BBC that Covid has contributed to a looming ""recruitment crisis"". The industry body says businesses will seek to link up with prisons that contain prisoners who are part of the Release On Temporary Licence (ROTL) programme. It's a risk-assessed scheme that inmates in open prisons use to gain work experience to help them in their transition back into the community. Tony Goodger, from AIMS, says some members already employ inmates on ROTL, and have found them to be ""well behaved, hard-working, and willing to learn"". We've got more on this storyhere.

A Covid vaccination clinic that had to close because of an anti-vaccine protest will reopen later this week. The pop-up clinic inside Cabot Circus Shopping Centre in Bristol was shut when about 60 protesters gathered outside on Sunday afternoon. Avon and Somerset Police says the clinic closed ""for the welfare and safety of staff and patients"". In a statement, the NHS said it was ""disappointed"" that vaccinations had to be paused. Some of the protesters addressed shoppers outside the clinic using a megaphone, telling them not to get the vaccine. The pop-up clinic is due to re-open to people aged 16 and over on 27 and 28 August from 11:00 to 19:00 BST. Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst Chinaâs capital city Beijing has today relaxed
its remaining local lockdowns, meaning that life is somewhat back to normal for residents. There were fears of a widespread outbreak in
Beijing after a local case of Covid-19 was detected in the city on 28 July. Sporadic cases were subsequently reported, meaning that the city swiftly locked
down communities where people had tested positive, andimposed travel restrictions on people entering and leaving the city.,external Large-scale testing drives,externalinvolving millions of
people also took place. Almost three weeks ago, the cityâs government stressed that
all large-scale events throughout August should be cancelled,including the Beijing International Film Festival,external. Parks, cinemas and libraries were told to limit the number of visitors, and
many universities, including the prestigious Tsinghua University, announced
that they were suspending the start date of their new terms. But Beijing - which has population of around 21 million people - has not recorded any new symptomatic cases since 11 August,according to the official Xinhua News Agency,external, so the city has deemed it safe to lift its lockdowns. So we know that another 35m Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines are on order, on top of the 100m that have already been used or are on the way already - but who are they earmarked for? Because Prizer was the first vaccine to become available for use in the UK, that is what was given to the elderly and most vulnerable who were prioritised when the vaccine rollout started last December. Oxford-AstraZeneca was the second to be approved and because it was quickly available in particularly large numbers, it became the predominant vaccine as the UK rollout started to work down the age groups. But when rare instances of blood clots in younger people were linked to the AstraZeneca jab, under-30s were told they wouild be offered Pfizer or Moderna vaccines rather than the AstraZeneca one. Since then the AstraZeneca vaccine has been largely used for the second vaccines of those people who were given that first time around. The UK regulator has now approved the use of thePfizer-BioNTech vaccine in children aged 12-15and the UK's vaccines committee will now decide whether children should get the jab. The UK's booster programme is due to start next monthbut no decision has been announced on whether this third jab must match someone's first or second jab. If that is what is decided, then Pfizer will be used to boost the immunity of the elderly and vulnerable groups who were first to receive it at the end of 2020 and start of this year. If you're just joining us, here's a quick round-up of the main headlines this lunchtime: Back to our main news that the UK has ordered another35m coronavirus vaccines from Pfizer-BioNTech.,external That's on top of an extra 60 million doses of the same jab it ordered in April as part of the vaccination booster programme in the autumn. This extra order means that Pfizer has now pulled well clear of the Oxford Astra-Zeneca vaccine that at one stage made up the biggest part of the government's pre-orders. The latest order count for each vaccine from the very start of the pandemic is: Add those figures up and the total is several times the entire population of the UK but of course some of those vaccines have yet to be approved for use in this country. You may remember that at the end of last year, before a single vaccine was produced, the government took an early approach of exploring as many avenues as possible in terms of immunisation options..  You can read more about the UK's vaccine programmehere. As we've been reporting today, a new NHS video featuring people in their 20s and 30s who suffer from long Covid is being used as part of effortsto encourage young people to get vaccinated. Infection rates are currently highest among younger adults, but so too is vaccine hesitancy, according to BBC health correspondent Dominic Hughes. Dr Joanne Herman, a consultant in infectious diseases, urges young people to get vaccinated against Covid to protect their long-term health. ""Adults may be unable to work, but children will be prevented from learning and I think it's such an important time, you don't want months in bed, you don't want months when you're unable to do your sport or go out dancing or do anything you want, you want to be in the prime of your life."" Staff and supply shortages have taken their toll on the UK's economic recovery this month, according to a closely watched survey. The IHS Markit/CIPS Composite Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) for August hit a six-month low of 55.3, falling from 59.2 in July. Any reading above 50 indicates growth, but the bounce-back from the pandemic is losing momentum, say researchers. Firms have complained that self-isolation requirements for contacts of people with Covid havemade it hard for them to maintain staffing levels. IHS Markit economist Chris Williamson says: ""Despite Covid-19 containment measures easing to the lowest since the pandemic began, rising virus case numbers are deterring many forms of spending, notably by consumers, and have hit growth via worsening staff and supply shortages."" He says supplier delays have risen to a degree exceeded only once before - in the initial months of the pandemic. ""The number of companies reporting that output had fallen due to staff or materials shortages has risenfar above anything ever seen previouslyin more than 20 years of survey history,"" Williamson adds. BBC MonitoringThe world through its media The Zimbabwe Congress of Trade Unions (ZCTU) has sued several companies for ordering employees to receive Covid-19 vaccines or risk the sack. In an urgent courtfiling cited,externalby privately-owned ZimLive website, ZCTU said the actions of the companies violated workersâ constitutional rights. âThere is no law in Zimbabwe making vaccination compulsory. Each person, having fully considered the implications and effects of vaccination, is expected to make a personal decision on whether or not to get vaccinated,â ZCTU argues in the court application. Public Service Minister Paul Mavhima and Attorney General Prince Machaya are also enjoined in the case. The Zimbabwe government, which has ordered all civil servants to get vaccinated, is targeting to inoculate at least 10 million of its approximately 15 million citizens by the end of this year. People have been working out longer and can fit exercise into their daily routine better since the start of the pandemic, industry figures show. PureGym's one million members now visit 1.43 times a week on average, compared with 1.21 before lockdown, while the 17:00-20:00 peak has ""quietened down"". Visits are also now spread across the day and later into the evening. And personal trainer Harley Edwards says she has seen a change, with 100 of her 150 clients exercising solely online. She started an online class in February 2020 and, after lockdown a month later, numbers watching soared to 300. She says about 80% of her clients are mums who are now able to fit working out around their lifestyle better - logging on before or after work, or when childcare allows. ""I have members of my online group who had never exercised in their lives until lockdown, and now they would never give it up,""Harley says. BBC MonitoringThe world through its media Iran has recorded a further 38,657 positive cases and 610 Covid-related deaths, the country's health ministry says. New infections have risen slightly on Sunday's figure (36,419) but deaths have fallen from the 684 deaths reported yesterday. A further 5,108 people have been hospitalised. A total of 3,961,024 have recovered, while 7,695 patients are in critical condition. The ministry also says that 16,986,882 people have received at least one dose of a vaccine, while 6,150,817 people have received two doses, bringing the total number of administered doses to 23,137,699. James GallagherHealth and science correspondent, BBC News There are marked differences in your immune system after a natural infection with coronavirus and after vaccination. Which is better? It is now a serious question that has implications for whether children should ever be vaccinated. And whether we use the virus or booster shots to top up immunity in adults. Both have become contentious issues. ""We could be digging ourselves into a hole, for a very long time, where we think we can only keep Covid away by boosting every year,"" Prof Eleanor Riley, an immunologist from the University of Edinburgh, tells me. Prof Adam Finn, a government vaccine adviser, says over-vaccinating people, when other parts of the world had none, is ""a bit insane, it's not just inequitable, it's stupid"". I've spoken to experts to compare vaccine and natural infection with the virus -here's what they told me. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Taliban violence against protesters is increasing, the UN human rights organisation says The agency called on the Islamist group to stop using force, and allow peaceful demonstrations A second international flight carrying passengers leaving Afghanistan has now departed from Kabul airport The first flight to carry foreigners since the US pullout left on Thursday US officials described the Taliban co-operation as businesslike and professional Saturday will be the 20th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks in the US - which triggered a two-decade conflict in Afghanistan Edited by Tiffany Wertheimer We're now pausing our live coverage of the latest developments in and around Afghanistan - thanks for staying with us. Just to recap, here are the main headlines in the past 24 hours:  You can still follow all the latest developments on major news stories on theBBC News website. BBC OS A US flag is seen posted in the rubble of the World Trade Center in New York, two days after the attack there The BBC is covering the 20th anniversary of the 11 September 2001 attacks in the US, which led to the 20-year conflict in Afghanistan. This is the story of Chris Cruz, who explains in an interview to BBC's OS programme why he decided to join the US army. ""My mother was heading to work on a normal 11 September day. As soon as she exited the subway, she was told to start running as the buildings were coming down. She literally saw them coming down and described people jumping out of the windows,"" says Chris. ""When she finally made it home, I - as an 11-year-old boy at the time - had to tell her that she had burn marks and blood spots on the back of her legs. She was in a state of shock. ""As I grew up, I realised... I had the ability to be part of an organisation that could defend and prevent these atrocities for all Americans. ""9/11 played a role, but not in a way of revenge. I didn't want to join out of bloodlust. I served two tours in Afghanistan. Both of those times I volunteered to go. ""I don't think our mission would have succeeded without our Afghan partners. I agree we couldn't be there forever, but we made a promise to keep our partners safe and that we wouldn't turn our backs on them, and that's exactly what we've done."" Chris adds: ""I do think the way we pulled out, the way we left it, was completely wrong. There needed to be a better exit strategy."" New York Republican representative Lee Zeldin says it is âinfuriatingâ
that the Taliban are âback in controlâ of Afghanistan two decades after the
September 11 attacks. In an interview with Fox News, Zeldin, 41 - who joined the US
Army in 2003 and later deployed to Iraq - said he âcouldnât get on active
duty fast enoughâ following the attacks. âI vividly remember the sounds, the visuals, the motions,
the yellow ribbons on all the trees on the streets, the flags going up from home to home â a sense of patriotism and unity I had never
experienced at any other point in my life,â he said. Zeldin said he believed the US withdrawal
from Afghanistan would create a âpath towards leaving our nation more
domestically vulnerable to threatsâ. âCreating a nation as a safe haven of terrorism, and likely
allowing the rise of groups like al-Qaeda and IS, that has ramifications
beyond Afghanistanâs borders,â he said.  Nine out of 10 households in Afghanistan are not getting enough to eat, the World Food Programme has warned. Regional director Anthea Webb said that after the Taliban took power on 15 August, ""the portion of families resorting to extreme coping mechanisms, like skipping meals or preferring to give food to children instead of adults or limiting portion sizes had almost doubled"". The findings were based on phone calls to 1,600 random households between 17 June and 5 September. An international conference on aid to Afghanistan is due to take place on Monday and Webb called on donors to respond to an appeal for $200m. Food prices had risen sharply even before the Taliban takeover due a drought. Afghanistan is in an acute economic situation after Western powers suspended foreign aid, and the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) also halted payments. Pakistan has been delivering aid A former US Ambassador to Afghanistan has told BBC News the ""stunning"" retreat of US forces ""pulled the plumbing"" out of Afghan security forces. Karl Eikenberry described the situation as ""a house of cards militarily and politically"", and said the way the Afghan army had been developed by the United States had left it dependent on US intelligence, technology and firepower, which contributed to the rapid collapse in control. This video can not be played Karl Eikenberry described the collapse of Afghanistan's government as a ""house of cards"" Women playing cricket in Herat in 2015 Afghanistan Cricket Board chief Hamid Shinwari has pleaded with Australia not to cancel an upcoming match in Hobart over the Taliban's attitude to women in sport. Taliban officials have suggested they could ban women playing sport. Cricket Australia  said it would have to cancel a men's test against Afghanistan in Hobart on 27 November if women were banned. Mr Shinwari issued a statement saying that ""cricket diplomacy"" was preferable to a ""knee-jerk"" reaction. And he suggested that Taliban comments on the participation of women in cricket were not substantially different from the ""cultural and religious environment"" under the previous Ghani and Karzai governments. Mr Shinwari called on ""Cricket Australia and the whole cricketing world to keep the door open for us"". A Taliban official earlier toldAustralia's SBS,externalnews that sport was ""not necessary"" and ""in cricket, they might face a situation where their face and body will not be covered"".

Ms Farid said she still felt part of Afghanistan and wanted to ""stand for the freedom of women"". She spoke to the BBC's Chief International Correspondent Lyse Doucet. A second international civilian charter flight has just taken off from Kabul airport, headed for Doha. It is currently unclear how many people are on the flight, or their nationalities. It comes after more than 100 people, including US and UK nationals, were flown out of Afghanistan on Thursday. Qatari officials, who have been assisting the Taliban to reopen the airport, say it is up and running again. The Taliban say regular commercial flights will resume soon. As we've reported, the Taliban has declared victory in the Panjshir Valley, the final pocket of territory which remained outside their rule. However anti-Taliban resistance fighters have denied that, and said they were still present in ""all strategic positions"" in the province. Caught in the middle of the fighting are the citizens of Panjshir - some of whom are reported to have fled into the surrounding mountains to escape the violence, according to Afghanistan's Tolo News agency who quote Panjshir residents in Kabul. One family who lost a son during the fighting has warned of a humanitarian crisis in the region, but the Taliban has denied that, and described the conditions in Panjshir as ""normal"". Read more on why the Panjshir Valley is so significant This video can not be played Afghanistan: Taliban fighters raise flag in Panjshir Traditional clothes sellers in Kabul have said the new Taliban government is proving to be a boost for their income. ""Our business has changed now,"" seller Abdul Hameed told Reuters news agency. ""People are not going for jeans and T-shirts, they want traditional clothes and waistcoats. People do not have money to buy much, but still, they are coming to us more than before."" However shops selling jeans, suits and eye-catching dresses have said their profits are drying up. Sayed Numan Sadat told Reuters people are not daring to venture into his shop, which specialises in glitzy women's dresses. ""For now, the Islamic Emirate has permitted us to run our business. If things get better, we will continue. If not, we will shut our business and we will start a new type of work to feed ourselves."" While sales have boomed at traditional clothing stores, they have dropped significantly at other businesses, like this women's clothing shop Aid workers are warning that almost the entire population of Afghanistan could slide into poverty within the next few months,reports the Wall Street Journal.,external It says that even before the Taliban takeover, half of the countryâs roughly 40 million people already needed humanitarian assistance, according to the UN. Now, aid organisations are looking for ways to help the Afghan people without strengthening the Taliban's new administration. Afghanistan has been cut off from the international financial system and foreign aid since August, with more than $9bn (Â£6.5bn) in the Afghanistan central bankâs assets frozen in the West. Meanwhile,the World Health Organization warned this week that more than 2,000 health facilities in Afghanistan were now at risk of closing,externalbecause funding was halted, meaning millions of vulnerable Afghans could lose access to essential healthcare. The team became a symbol for the progress of Afghan women (File image) Members of the famed all-girls Afghan robotics team who faced an agonising wait before managing to escape Kabul have spoken to the BBC about their ordeal - and why they fear for the future for Afghan women. For 17-year-old Ayda and 18-year-old Somaya, the chaotic scenes of Kabul's fall to the Taliban will forever be etched into their memory. ""We tried to get a visa out, but couldn't. We were trying to go to the airport for three days. But we couldn't. There were thousands of people trying,"" Ayda says of her harrowing escape from Afghanistan. ""We were in the streets and so many children were crying. They couldn't find their families."" On the third day, however, they managed to get on a flight organised by Qatar's government, flying to Doha alongside seven other team members, all without their families. But even as they begin their new lives in Doha, the pair both say their minds drift back to those still in Afghanistan. Read more here. As we have been reporting, the director general of MI5 has warned that the fall of Afghanistan to the Taliban is likely to have ""emboldened"" UK terrorists. Ken McCallum told the BBCthat while the terror threat would not change overnight, there could be a ""morale boost"" for extremists. Fears over the link between the Taliban takeover and terrorism have also been expressed by UN chief Antonio Guterres. In an interview with AFP news agency, he was asked about the risks of an Afghanistan-like scenario happening in West Africa's Sahel region, where Islamist groups are waging insurgencies. Guterres said there was a ""real danger"" that some ""terrorist groups may feel enthusiastic about what happened and have ambitions beyond what they thought a few months ago"". He said he was worried about fanatical groups where death ""is desirable"", and that it was ""essential to reinforce security mechanisms in the Sahel"". Click here to read more about what the Taliban takeover means for Africa's jihadists Guterres also warned of extremists feeling emboldened Welcome to our live coverage of the latest developments in Afghanistan. The BBC will also be reflecting on the 20th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks in the US, and how they defined the 20-year conflict. Our correspondents will be reporting from New York, Kabul, Guantanamo Bay and elsewhere. Here are some of the biggest updates we've been covering on Friday:  As we reported earlier, the first civilian charter flight from Afghanistan since the US pullout from the country arrived in Doha on Thursday night. Qatar Airways flew more than 100 foreign nationals from Kabul to Doha. They included 13 Britons and up to 30 Americans. The US said the Taliban had shown flexibility, and been ""business-like and professional"" in facilitating the departure of American citizens. More than 100 people were on the flight headed to Doha and included families with children This is the first commercial international flight to leave Kabul since the airlift was suspended at the end of August Some international flights have been in and out before, but largely carrying aid and technicians who were part of the team helping to get Kabul's airport operational again Russia will not take part ""in any way"" in the Taliban government's inauguration ceremony in Afghanistan, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov has said. ""We do not know how this situation will develop. That is why we say that it is important for us to understand what the first and subsequent steps of the current leadership of Afghanistan will be,"" he said. Earlier in the week, the speaker of Russia's upper house of parliament said Russia would be represented at the
inauguration by ambassador-level officials, the RIA news agency had reported. On Thursday, President Vladimir Putin said Russia was in talks with the Taliban to facilitate the evacuation
from Afghanistan of nationals of other countries. ""Many are asking us to help bring out of Afghanistan
nationals of third countries, as well as some Afghans. We are not doing this
covertly; we too are in talks with Taliban leaders in relation to certain
categories of people and we are doing this,"" he told a news conference in Moscow. Gordon CoreraSecurity correspondent, BBC News For the past two decades, terrorism has dominated MI5's work. But with significant shifts over time. It took the attacks of 7 July 2005 for it to fully understand the threat came from within as well as abroad. By the 10th anniversary of 9/11, the sense was that the threat from al-Qaeda might be receding and MI5 could turn to other issues of concern, such as state espionage. But then the Islamic State group emerged out of Iraq and Syria and a new wave started - less sophisticated and organised but still deadly. Once again, in the last couple of years, there was a hope that this jihadist threat might be slowing as MI5 took on extreme-right wing activity and focused more on Russia and China. But recent events have raised concerns that the jihadist threat could evolve once again, with Afghanistan inspiring people to act, or by the Western withdrawal creating a new safe haven for groups to operate in and plan more sophisticated attacks, as they did in the years around 9/11. MI5 boss warns of Afghanistan 'morale boost' for extremists The UN rights office says the Taliban have been ""increasingly violent"" against protesters, using live ammunition, batons and whips. Spokesperson Ravina Shamdasani told a briefing in Geneva that the agency had received credible reports that at least four people had been killed at protests in recent days. Protesters have also been beaten and detained. In addition to violence against protesters, the UN said the Taliban had been increasingly using force against those reporting on the demonstrations. Earlier this week, the Taliban issued an order prohibiting ""unauthorised assemblies"". ""Rather than banning peaceful protests, the Taliban should cease the use of force and ensure the freedom of peaceful assembly and expression, including as a means for people to voice their concerns and exercise their right to participate in public affairs,"" the UN rights office said. Click here to read more about how journalists have been beaten, detained and flogged by the Taliban when attempting to cover protests Some of the Afghans evacuated to Australia who have now left hotel quarantine say they are grateful for their escape, but worry about those left behind. ""We have seen a few children who have come with heavy
trauma,"" aid worker Assadullah Khurrami told Reuters. ""The evacuees are very grateful... but
at the same time there is a lot of desperation, a lot of sadness
in these families, in these individuals, because they still have
loved ones and family members left in Afghanistan."" One such refugee is Amena - a member of the Hazara ethnic group which has been persecuted by extremists - who managed to escape on one of the last evacuation flights, but was forced to leave her family behind at Kabul airport. âThey caught my brothers, my parents and stopped them from moving beyond the gate. I was on one side of the gate, they were on the other. The Taliban had guns, they were hitting people,â she told SBS News. While Amena had a visa to Australia, the rest of her family didn't. They're now in hiding in Kabul, unable to return home to rural Afghanistan because it has been taken by the Taliban. Australia managed to evacuate a total of 4,100 people from Kabul after it fell to the Taliban. Pakistan's role in the recent events has been much disputed. It has led to anti-Pakistan protests in the Afghan capital. On the other hand, some Western powers seeking to influence the new Taliban government, are hoping that Pakistan could play a role as a mediator. Pakistan's foreign minister on Friday said he wanted peace and prosperity in Afghanistan, while calling for a humanitarian crisis there to be averted. In a statement reported by local media, Shah Mehmood Qureshi said Pakistan was committed to helping Afghanistan, despite having limited resources. He said Pakistan had sent medicine and food to Kabul on Thursday, and urged other countries to take action too. And he added: ""We should encourage the Taliban not to allow their land to be used against any other country."" Anti-Pakistan protestshave been held in Kabul this week, with many Afghans believing the country supports the Taliban. Claims have emerged that in recent days Pakistani drones have been used to help the Taliban, by targeting anti-Taliban positions. The claims have been dismissed by Pakistan, as well as by the Taliban. A spokesman for the Pakistani armed forces, Gen Babar Iftikhar, told the BBC they were ""complete lies"".

Thanks for joining us, we'll be back tomorrow morning. Here's a recap of the day's main Covid news: The UK has recorded a further 31,914 new Covid-19 cases,Monday's official figures show.,external There have also been a further 40 deaths within 28 days of a positive test. Meanwhile, a further 40,345 first vaccine doses have been administered, as well as another 116,352 second doses. It means that 76.9% of over-16s in the UK have now been fully vaccinated, while 87.7% have had at least one dose. Reality Check As we reported earlier, coronavirus was the ninth biggest cause of death in England in July, up from the 26th most common cause in June. In Wales it was the 22nd leading cause of death, having been too low to rank the previous month. The total number of people dying rose back above the average levels for 2015 to 2019 in July. The number of deaths was 7.6% higher than average in England and 10.4% higher in Wales,figures from the Office for National Statistics,externalshow. Since the start of the pandemic in March 2020, Covid has been the number one cause of death in England and Wales for six months (April, May, November and December 2020 and January and February 2021). When there isn't a pandemic, the top causes of death are usually heart disease and dementia. The figures record the one condition named as the underlying cause of death. So, it does not include cases in which Covid was just mentioned on the death certificate as a contributory cause. They show the deaths registered in each period, not when the deaths actually occurred. Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst Thereâs a lot of focus in China today on one of the
countryâs top medical experts being cleared over academic misconduct. Zhang Wenhong is a renowned infectious disease expert who
is often nicknamed âChinaâs Dr Fauciâ. He is extremely popular in China
and has become of the countryâs most trusted voices on Covid-19. However, the national Global Times newspaper notes that
there were calls in early August to investigate his academic background, with
some on the popular Sina Weibo microblogclaiming that his doctorate paper showed signs of plagiarism.,external Fudan University, which is one of Chinaâs top universities,
subsequently said it would carry out an investigation into these claims, in
accordance with relevant academic standards. Today, the university has released the findings of these
results, and according to the national China Daily newspaper, has found that
âZhangâs doctoral dissertation had met the requirements for doctoral
dissertations at that timeâ. In a statement on its website,external, it says that his
work âdoes not constitute academic misconductâ. Given Dr Zhangâs popularity, many on Chinaâs Sina Weibo
social network are pleased with these results. Comments are rife on the
platform about how those that made âslanderousâ comments about him should
apologise or âbe held accountableâ for spreading online rumours. Global Times notes,externalthat recent criticism over Dr Zhang
might have been sparked by an early ""misinterpreted"" remark he had
made, that some saw as contradictory to China's official messaging on Covid-19. Cumbria's director of public health is urging tourists to take a lateral flow Covid test before visiting the county in north-west England. It follows a sharp increase in the number of coronavirus cases in the Eden district. There are now 387 cases per 100,000 people - double the number compared with the week before. Colin Cox says it is unclear whether tourism is a factor, but is urging people to check they are Covid-free before travelling and to continue wearing face coverings in public places. As we reported just now, police have been called to ITN's London headquarters after anti-vaccine protesters entered the building. We've got a bit more detail now from ITN. In a statement, a spokeswoman says police are attending a ""breach of security"" at its studios on Grays' Inn Road. ITN says it takes such breaches ""very seriously"" and that the safety of its staff and journalists is of ""paramount importance"". ""All personnel have been advised to either stay in the
building or stay away while the situation is being dealt with,"" the statement adds. Pfizer's two-dose Covid-19 vaccine has received full approval from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), becoming the first jab to be licensed in the US. The vaccine had initially been given emergency use authorisation. Its two jabs are now fully approved for those aged 16 and older. The approval is expected to set off more vaccine mandates by employers and organisations across the country. It comes amid lingering vaccine hesitancy among many Americans. In a statement, the FDA says its review for approval includes data from approximately 44,000 people. Acting FDA commissioner Janet Woodcock says that the public ""can be very confident"" the vaccine meets high safety, effectiveness and manufacturing quality standards. Read more on this story here. Abattoirs, butchers and meat processors are set to employ prisoners and ex-inmates to help plug 14,000 job vacancies. The Association of Independent Meat Suppliers (AIMS) tells the BBC that Covid has contributed to a looming ""recruitment crisis"". The industry body says businesses will seek to link up with prisons that contain prisoners who are part of the Release On Temporary Licence (ROTL) programme. It's a risk-assessed scheme that inmates in open prisons use to gain work experience to help them in their transition back into the community. Tony Goodger, from AIMS, says some members already employ inmates on ROTL, and have found them to be ""well behaved, hard-working, and willing to learn"". We've got more on this storyhere.

A Covid vaccination clinic that had to close because of an anti-vaccine protest will reopen later this week. The pop-up clinic inside Cabot Circus Shopping Centre in Bristol was shut when about 60 protesters gathered outside on Sunday afternoon. Avon and Somerset Police says the clinic closed ""for the welfare and safety of staff and patients"". In a statement, the NHS said it was ""disappointed"" that vaccinations had to be paused. Some of the protesters addressed shoppers outside the clinic using a megaphone, telling them not to get the vaccine. The pop-up clinic is due to re-open to people aged 16 and over on 27 and 28 August from 11:00 to 19:00 BST. Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst Chinaâs capital city Beijing has today relaxed
its remaining local lockdowns, meaning that life is somewhat back to normal for residents. There were fears of a widespread outbreak in
Beijing after a local case of Covid-19 was detected in the city on 28 July. Sporadic cases were subsequently reported, meaning that the city swiftly locked
down communities where people had tested positive, andimposed travel restrictions on people entering and leaving the city.,external Large-scale testing drives,externalinvolving millions of
people also took place. Almost three weeks ago, the cityâs government stressed that
all large-scale events throughout August should be cancelled,including the Beijing International Film Festival,external. Parks, cinemas and libraries were told to limit the number of visitors, and
many universities, including the prestigious Tsinghua University, announced
that they were suspending the start date of their new terms. But Beijing - which has population of around 21 million people - has not recorded any new symptomatic cases since 11 August,according to the official Xinhua News Agency,external, so the city has deemed it safe to lift its lockdowns. So we know that another 35m Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines are on order, on top of the 100m that have already been used or are on the way already - but who are they earmarked for? Because Prizer was the first vaccine to become available for use in the UK, that is what was given to the elderly and most vulnerable who were prioritised when the vaccine rollout started last December. Oxford-AstraZeneca was the second to be approved and because it was quickly available in particularly large numbers, it became the predominant vaccine as the UK rollout started to work down the age groups. But when rare instances of blood clots in younger people were linked to the AstraZeneca jab, under-30s were told they wouild be offered Pfizer or Moderna vaccines rather than the AstraZeneca one. Since then the AstraZeneca vaccine has been largely used for the second vaccines of those people who were given that first time around. The UK regulator has now approved the use of thePfizer-BioNTech vaccine in children aged 12-15and the UK's vaccines committee will now decide whether children should get the jab. The UK's booster programme is due to start next monthbut no decision has been announced on whether this third jab must match someone's first or second jab. If that is what is decided, then Pfizer will be used to boost the immunity of the elderly and vulnerable groups who were first to receive it at the end of 2020 and start of this year. If you're just joining us, here's a quick round-up of the main headlines this lunchtime: Back to our main news that the UK has ordered another35m coronavirus vaccines from Pfizer-BioNTech.,external That's on top of an extra 60 million doses of the same jab it ordered in April as part of the vaccination booster programme in the autumn. This extra order means that Pfizer has now pulled well clear of the Oxford Astra-Zeneca vaccine that at one stage made up the biggest part of the government's pre-orders. The latest order count for each vaccine from the very start of the pandemic is: Add those figures up and the total is several times the entire population of the UK but of course some of those vaccines have yet to be approved for use in this country. You may remember that at the end of last year, before a single vaccine was produced, the government took an early approach of exploring as many avenues as possible in terms of immunisation options..  You can read more about the UK's vaccine programmehere. As we've been reporting today, a new NHS video featuring people in their 20s and 30s who suffer from long Covid is being used as part of effortsto encourage young people to get vaccinated. Infection rates are currently highest among younger adults, but so too is vaccine hesitancy, according to BBC health correspondent Dominic Hughes. Dr Joanne Herman, a consultant in infectious diseases, urges young people to get vaccinated against Covid to protect their long-term health. ""Adults may be unable to work, but children will be prevented from learning and I think it's such an important time, you don't want months in bed, you don't want months when you're unable to do your sport or go out dancing or do anything you want, you want to be in the prime of your life."" Staff and supply shortages have taken their toll on the UK's economic recovery this month, according to a closely watched survey. The IHS Markit/CIPS Composite Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) for August hit a six-month low of 55.3, falling from 59.2 in July. Any reading above 50 indicates growth, but the bounce-back from the pandemic is losing momentum, say researchers. Firms have complained that self-isolation requirements for contacts of people with Covid havemade it hard for them to maintain staffing levels. IHS Markit economist Chris Williamson says: ""Despite Covid-19 containment measures easing to the lowest since the pandemic began, rising virus case numbers are deterring many forms of spending, notably by consumers, and have hit growth via worsening staff and supply shortages."" He says supplier delays have risen to a degree exceeded only once before - in the initial months of the pandemic. ""The number of companies reporting that output had fallen due to staff or materials shortages has risenfar above anything ever seen previouslyin more than 20 years of survey history,"" Williamson adds. BBC MonitoringThe world through its media The Zimbabwe Congress of Trade Unions (ZCTU) has sued several companies for ordering employees to receive Covid-19 vaccines or risk the sack. In an urgent courtfiling cited,externalby privately-owned ZimLive website, ZCTU said the actions of the companies violated workersâ constitutional rights. âThere is no law in Zimbabwe making vaccination compulsory. Each person, having fully considered the implications and effects of vaccination, is expected to make a personal decision on whether or not to get vaccinated,â ZCTU argues in the court application. Public Service Minister Paul Mavhima and Attorney General Prince Machaya are also enjoined in the case. The Zimbabwe government, which has ordered all civil servants to get vaccinated, is targeting to inoculate at least 10 million of its approximately 15 million citizens by the end of this year. People have been working out longer and can fit exercise into their daily routine better since the start of the pandemic, industry figures show. PureGym's one million members now visit 1.43 times a week on average, compared with 1.21 before lockdown, while the 17:00-20:00 peak has ""quietened down"". Visits are also now spread across the day and later into the evening. And personal trainer Harley Edwards says she has seen a change, with 100 of her 150 clients exercising solely online. She started an online class in February 2020 and, after lockdown a month later, numbers watching soared to 300. She says about 80% of her clients are mums who are now able to fit working out around their lifestyle better - logging on before or after work, or when childcare allows. ""I have members of my online group who had never exercised in their lives until lockdown, and now they would never give it up,""Harley says. BBC MonitoringThe world through its media Iran has recorded a further 38,657 positive cases and 610 Covid-related deaths, the country's health ministry says. New infections have risen slightly on Sunday's figure (36,419) but deaths have fallen from the 684 deaths reported yesterday. A further 5,108 people have been hospitalised. A total of 3,961,024 have recovered, while 7,695 patients are in critical condition. The ministry also says that 16,986,882 people have received at least one dose of a vaccine, while 6,150,817 people have received two doses, bringing the total number of administered doses to 23,137,699. James GallagherHealth and science correspondent, BBC News There are marked differences in your immune system after a natural infection with coronavirus and after vaccination. Which is better? It is now a serious question that has implications for whether children should ever be vaccinated. And whether we use the virus or booster shots to top up immunity in adults. Both have become contentious issues. ""We could be digging ourselves into a hole, for a very long time, where we think we can only keep Covid away by boosting every year,"" Prof Eleanor Riley, an immunologist from the University of Edinburgh, tells me. Prof Adam Finn, a government vaccine adviser, says over-vaccinating people, when other parts of the world had none, is ""a bit insane, it's not just inequitable, it's stupid"". I've spoken to experts to compare vaccine and natural infection with the virus -here's what they told me. Â© 2025 BBC.

"A fifth of all gambling premises in the UK are now located in the poorest areas of the country, new research has found. Betting shops are 10 times more likely to be found in deprived towns than in affluent areas, according to a study by the University of Bristol. The areas with the highest number of betting shops per capita included Glasgow, Liverpool, London and Middlesbrough, the study found. This comes amid the government's ongoing review of the Gambling Act. A spokesman for the Gambling Commission - which is the government body that regulates gambling - said: ""Tackling gambling harm is a number one priority for the Gambling Commission. ""We will carefully consider the issues raised by any gambling-related research and any actions will be taken through the national strategy to reduce gambling harms."" 'I stole Â£70,000 to feed my gambling addiction' Paddy Power owner betting shops rebound 'Women don't need to feel shame about gambling addiction' Although the number has been declining in recent years, there were still more gambling sites in Britain than shops run by the big eight supermarket chains put together, said the study, which is supported by the Standard Life Foundation. The research highlights a disproportion between the amenities available on local High Streets for people living in deprived communities, compared to the amenities available in more affluent areas. For instance, just 10% of all food stores are located in the poorest areas, yet these places were home to as many as 34% of amusement arcades, 30% of bingo venues and 29% of adult gaming centres. In contrast, more affluent towns and cities had a much more even spread of services like libraries and supermarkets, the research showed. And half of UK gambling treatment centres can be found within a five-minute walk - 250 metres - of the nearest gambling premises, while nearly 10% of schools have a gambling venue within a five-minute walk - affecting 742,000 school pupils in more than 2,000 schools across the country. ""The research highlights the clear mismatch between the amenities available in 'left behind' areas, compared with those that are more affluent,"" said Jamie Evans, senior research associate at the University of Bristol. ""Rather than having greater access to the facilities, services and opportunities that help people to improve their lives, those in more deprived communities are disproportionately faced with choices that can often prove harmful. While the gambling industry may offer some much-needed employment in these areas, it usually takes much more than it gives, leaving a legacy of greater hardship and increased social problems."" Liz and Charles Ritchie started the Gambling With Lives charity after they lost their son Jack to suicide in 2017. They say that currently at least 500 young people die every year, having had a gambling addiction. Liz and Charles Ritchie's son Jack took his life in 2017. He began visiting betting shops during his school lunch break at age 17 ""Predatory gambling companies target the poor and the young. We know the tragic cost of this targeting - at least one death per day,"" Ms Ritchie told the BBC. ""Many of the young people we have lost... were enticed into gambling premises very near schools or on their bus routes home."" Mr Ritchie is concerned that the government is ""putting business before lives"". ""At the moment, local communities have so little say in opposing any planning,"" he said. ""We've been contacted by local communities who have had a terrible problem with this. People don't want betting shops."" The couple want to see local authorities and communities given much greater power to veto licences for betting shops, particularly if they are close to schools and other facilities used by young people. However the Betting and Gaming Council stressed that betting shops and casinos have made a ""huge economic contribution"" to the UK. A spokesman for the Betting and Gaming Council said: ""BGC members support 119,000 jobs, generate Â£4.5bn in tax to pay for vital public services and contribute Â£7.7bn to the economy in gross value added. ""Betting shops alone employ around 46,000 people across the country, pay Â£1bn in tax to the Treasury as well as Â£60m in business rates for local councils, while casinos employ 11,000 staff and pay Â£500m a year in tax."" The BBC understands that the government requires gambling premises to conduct local area risk assessments and explain how they are able to mitigate the risk of underage gambling. But Mr Evans says this is not good enough: ""While gambling premises may provide jobs, we know that gambling can lead to a wide variety of financial, social and health problems, with problem gambling affecting not just the gambler themselves but many of those closest to them as well. ""These are problems which simply add to the many challenges that our most deprived communities already face.""

"Thousands of people are scrambling to flee Afghanistan after the Taliban seized back control of the country, almost two decades after they were ousted by a US-led coalition. The United Nations has warned that up to half a million Afghans could flee the country by the end of the year and has called on neighbouring countries to keep their borders open. The current crisis comes on top of the 2.2 million Afghan refugees already in neighbouring countries and 3.5 million people forced to flee their homes within Afghanistan's borders. The US-led operation to evacuate people by air has now ended, with the last flight taking off from Kabul airport just after midnight on Tuesday - a deadline agreed with the Taliban for foreign forces to withdraw. More than 123,000 civilians were evacuated by US forces and its coalition partners after the Taliban took control of the capital on 14 August - but it's unclear exactly how many of those were Afghan nationals. The US has said that it flew nearly 80,000 civilians out of Kabul and of those, about 5,500 were Americans and more than 73,500 were either Afghans or other foreign nationals. While the UK Ministry of Defence, which ended its evacuations on Saturday, said it had flown out more than 15,000 people and some 8,000 of them were Afghans. At the height of the operation, the US said its military planes were departing the airport every 39 minutes - although the evacuations did slow down after the suicide bomb attack on the 26 August outside the airport, which killed about 170 people, including 13 American troops. Many of those flown out of the country were taken to emergency processing centres set up in several countries, including Spain, Germany, Qatar and Uzbekistan. The Ramstein military base in Germany has become a makeshift camp for thousands of Afghans As many as 300,000 Afghans have been affiliated with US operations in the country since 2001,according,externalto the International Rescue Committee, and tens of thousands of them are eligible to obtain a US visa - but many will now have to find a different way out of the country. At the weekend, the US said it had received assurances from the Taliban that Afghan nationals who are issued with valid travel documents by another country will be allowed to leave Afghanistan. The Taliban control all the main land crossing points with Afghanistan's neighbours (shown on the map below) and reports suggest they are only allowing traders or those with valid travel documents to leave the country. However, many of those trying to flee because they fear for their safety under Taliban rule will not have any paperwork. The UN has urged Afghanistan's neighbours to keep their borders open to refugees and called on the international community to support those countries. But Uzbekistan, which borders the north of Afghanistan, has said its main crossing point is closed to ""ensure security"" and there are no plans to open it. Pakistan, which has the longest border with Afghanistan, has also said it will not accept refugees - with its US ambassador telling the BBC: ""We are already overburdened by the refugees, and it is beyond our capacity to host any more refugees."" Last week, satellite imagery of the Spin Boldak crossing point between Afghanistan and Pakistan showed a large crowd of people gathered on the Afghan side. The BBC's Shumaila Jaffery, who was at the crossing point, said it was a chaotic scene with many Afghans not being allowed to enter Pakistan. Last Friday, two Afghans were reportedly killed by Pakistani security forces at the Torkham border crossing after trying to enter Pakistan illegally. There have also been reports of thousands of Afghans trying to cross the western border with Iran, but it's unclear how many have been successful. Left behind in Afghanistan: If I can't get out, I'll die The latest movement of Afghans is part of a historical exodus from a country that has suffered instability and conflict over many years. Even before the Taliban retook control, more than 550,000 people had been forced to flee their homes this year due to fighting, according to the UNHCR. That means an estimated 3.5 million Afghans are currently internally displaced within the country. In addition to those within Afghanistan's borders, about 2.2 million refugees and asylum seekers were also seeking sanctuary in neighbouring nations as of the end of last year. This year, Afghans have also had to deal with a severe drought and food shortages across most of the country. A report by the UN World Food Programme (WFP) in June said that 14 million people - more than a third of the population - were suffering from hunger. Mary-Ellen McGroarty, WFP country director for Afghanistan, said last week that unless emergency food and medical supplies arrived soon, the ""already horrendous situation"" would become ""an absolute catastrophe, a complete humanitarian disaster"". Neighbouring countries Pakistan and Iran saw the highest numbers of Afghanistan's refugees and asylum seekers last year. Almost 1.5 million fled to Pakistan in 2020, while Iran hosted 780,000, according to UNHCR figures. Germany was third, with more than 180,000, while Turkey took nearly 130,000. When looking at asylum seeker numbers only - those who have applied for sanctuary in another country but whose claims have not yet been granted - Turkey, Germany and Greece top the list, with about 125,000, 33,000 and 20,000 respectively. Although there are no Afghan asylum seekers in Iran, those with refugee cards - an official document recognising their status - are able to access the country's health and education systems. The UN has called on its member states to help Afghan people in ""their darkest hour of need"" - but while some countries have offered refugees a safe haven, others have indicated they will not be giving sanctuary to those fleeing the crisis. BothPakistanandIranhave said that they cannot cope with a further influx of Afghan refugees. Officials in both countries have said that any refugees that do arrive will have to stay in camps near the border until they can return to Afghanistan. Uzbekistanhas said it will help transfer Afghans to third countries but will only host refugees temporarily. TheTajikistangovernment previously offered to accept up to 100,000 refugees but it's unclear if any have been allowed in yet.Turkmenistanhas said its airspace can be used for evacuation flights but it hasn't made any commitment to take in refugees itself. Turkish security forces patrolling the border with Iran help an exhausted Afghan family InTurkey, the government has urged European countries to take responsibility for any new migrant crisis, saying Turkey would not be ""Europe's migrant storage unit"". The country has stepped up construction of a border wall with Iran to thwart those entering illegally. Officials in severalEuropean Unioncountries say they are keen to avoid a repeat of the 2015 migrant crisis, when there was a populist backlash against large numbers of Syrian refugees being allowed to enter EU territory. France, which evacuated more than 2,800 people from Kabul airport, mostly Afghans, has indicated it will accept some refugees but has not specified a number.Germanyhas also not specified a number but Chancellor Angela Merkel has said as many as 40,000 people still in the country may have a right to be evacuated to Germany if they feel they are endangered. Polish soldiers have been erecting a fence along the border with Belarus to stop illegal crossings Other EU countries, likeAustria,PolandandSwitzerlandhave said they will not accept any new Afghan arrivals and are upping their border security to guard against illegal arrivals. TheUKhas said it will take in 5,000 Afghans in 2021 as part of a scheme to resettle 20,000 over the next few years, focusing on those at greatest risk from the Taliban. TheUShas not said how many refugees it will accept yet, but it has authorised $500m (Â£367m) for ""unexpected urgent refugee and migration needs of refugees"".Canadahas said that it will resettle 20,000 Afghans whileAustraliahas said it will take in 3,000. Several countries, includingKosovoandUganda, have also accepted US requests to temporarily accept Afghan refugees before they are resettled elsewhere.

"The UK has agreed a contract for 35 million more doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine The doses will be delivered from the second half of next year and will help ""future proof"" the UK's vaccination programme, the government says The US FDA has granted full approval to the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine for people aged 16 and over; previously it only had emergency approval Eighty-two private Covid travel test firms listed on No 10's website are warned over misleading prices, and 57 have been removed New Zealand's national lockdown has been extended, with Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern urging caution amid the Delta variant Taiwan has begun administering its first domestically developed Covid-19 vaccine, amid criticism that its approval was rushed Young long-Covid sufferers in the UK have urged others to get vaccinated against the virus The UK recorded 32,253 new infections and 49 more deaths within 28 days of a positive test on Sunday Edited by Hamish Mackay We're bringing our live coverage of the pandemic to a close for the day. Thanks for joining us, we'll be back tomorrow morning. Here's a recap of the day's main Covid news: The UK has recorded a further 31,914 new Covid-19 cases,Monday's official figures show.,external There have also been a further 40 deaths within 28 days of a positive test. Meanwhile, a further 40,345 first vaccine doses have been administered, as well as another 116,352 second doses. It means that 76.9% of over-16s in the UK have now been fully vaccinated, while 87.7% have had at least one dose. Reality Check As we reported earlier, coronavirus was the ninth biggest cause of death in England in July, up from the 26th most common cause in June. In Wales it was the 22nd leading cause of death, having been too low to rank the previous month. The total number of people dying rose back above the average levels for 2015 to 2019 in July. The number of deaths was 7.6% higher than average in England and 10.4% higher in Wales,figures from the Office for National Statistics,externalshow. Since the start of the pandemic in March 2020, Covid has been the number one cause of death in England and Wales for six months (April, May, November and December 2020 and January and February 2021). When there isn't a pandemic, the top causes of death are usually heart disease and dementia. The figures record the one condition named as the underlying cause of death. So, it does not include cases in which Covid was just mentioned on the death certificate as a contributory cause. They show the deaths registered in each period, not when the deaths actually occurred. Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst Thereâs a lot of focus in China today on one of the
countryâs top medical experts being cleared over academic misconduct. Zhang Wenhong is a renowned infectious disease expert who
is often nicknamed âChinaâs Dr Fauciâ. He is extremely popular in China
and has become of the countryâs most trusted voices on Covid-19. However, the national Global Times newspaper notes that
there were calls in early August to investigate his academic background, with
some on the popular Sina Weibo microblogclaiming that his doctorate paper showed signs of plagiarism.,external Fudan University, which is one of Chinaâs top universities,
subsequently said it would carry out an investigation into these claims, in
accordance with relevant academic standards. Today, the university has released the findings of these
results, and according to the national China Daily newspaper, has found that
âZhangâs doctoral dissertation had met the requirements for doctoral
dissertations at that timeâ. In a statement on its website,external, it says that his
work âdoes not constitute academic misconductâ. Given Dr Zhangâs popularity, many on Chinaâs Sina Weibo
social network are pleased with these results. Comments are rife on the
platform about how those that made âslanderousâ comments about him should
apologise or âbe held accountableâ for spreading online rumours. Global Times notes,externalthat recent criticism over Dr Zhang
might have been sparked by an early ""misinterpreted"" remark he had
made, that some saw as contradictory to China's official messaging on Covid-19. Cumbria's director of public health is urging tourists to take a lateral flow Covid test before visiting the county in north-west England. It follows a sharp increase in the number of coronavirus cases in the Eden district. There are now 387 cases per 100,000 people - double the number compared with the week before. Colin Cox says it is unclear whether tourism is a factor, but is urging people to check they are Covid-free before travelling and to continue wearing face coverings in public places. As we reported just now, police have been called to ITN's London headquarters after anti-vaccine protesters entered the building. We've got a bit more detail now from ITN. In a statement, a spokeswoman says police are attending a ""breach of security"" at its studios on Grays' Inn Road. ITN says it takes such breaches ""very seriously"" and that the safety of its staff and journalists is of ""paramount importance"". ""All personnel have been advised to either stay in the
building or stay away while the situation is being dealt with,"" the statement adds. Pfizer's two-dose Covid-19 vaccine has received full approval from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), becoming the first jab to be licensed in the US. The vaccine had initially been given emergency use authorisation. Its two jabs are now fully approved for those aged 16 and older. The approval is expected to set off more vaccine mandates by employers and organisations across the country. It comes amid lingering vaccine hesitancy among many Americans. In a statement, the FDA says its review for approval includes data from approximately 44,000 people. Acting FDA commissioner Janet Woodcock says that the public ""can be very confident"" the vaccine meets high safety, effectiveness and manufacturing quality standards. Read more on this story here. Abattoirs, butchers and meat processors are set to employ prisoners and ex-inmates to help plug 14,000 job vacancies. The Association of Independent Meat Suppliers (AIMS) tells the BBC that Covid has contributed to a looming ""recruitment crisis"". The industry body says businesses will seek to link up with prisons that contain prisoners who are part of the Release On Temporary Licence (ROTL) programme. It's a risk-assessed scheme that inmates in open prisons use to gain work experience to help them in their transition back into the community. Tony Goodger, from AIMS, says some members already employ inmates on ROTL, and have found them to be ""well behaved, hard-working, and willing to learn"". We've got more on this storyhere. A group of anti-vaccine protesters have entered ITN Production's London headquarters on Gray's Inn road, in Camden. In a statement posted on Twitter on Monday,external- and subsequently retweeted by ITN - the Metropolitan Police said officers were ""responding to a demonstration at a private premises on Grayâs Inn Road...where people have unlawfully gained access to the building"" and that police were ""engaging with building security and removing those who have gained entry"".

A Covid vaccination clinic that had to close because of an anti-vaccine protest will reopen later this week. The pop-up clinic inside Cabot Circus Shopping Centre in Bristol was shut when about 60 protesters gathered outside on Sunday afternoon. Avon and Somerset Police says the clinic closed ""for the welfare and safety of staff and patients"". In a statement, the NHS said it was ""disappointed"" that vaccinations had to be paused. Some of the protesters addressed shoppers outside the clinic using a megaphone, telling them not to get the vaccine. The pop-up clinic is due to re-open to people aged 16 and over on 27 and 28 August from 11:00 to 19:00 BST. Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst Chinaâs capital city Beijing has today relaxed
its remaining local lockdowns, meaning that life is somewhat back to normal for residents. There were fears of a widespread outbreak in
Beijing after a local case of Covid-19 was detected in the city on 28 July. Sporadic cases were subsequently reported, meaning that the city swiftly locked
down communities where people had tested positive, andimposed travel restrictions on people entering and leaving the city.,external Large-scale testing drives,externalinvolving millions of
people also took place. Almost three weeks ago, the cityâs government stressed that
all large-scale events throughout August should be cancelled,including the Beijing International Film Festival,external. Parks, cinemas and libraries were told to limit the number of visitors, and
many universities, including the prestigious Tsinghua University, announced
that they were suspending the start date of their new terms. But Beijing - which has population of around 21 million people - has not recorded any new symptomatic cases since 11 August,according to the official Xinhua News Agency,external, so the city has deemed it safe to lift its lockdowns. So we know that another 35m Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines are on order, on top of the 100m that have already been used or are on the way already - but who are they earmarked for? Because Prizer was the first vaccine to become available for use in the UK, that is what was given to the elderly and most vulnerable who were prioritised when the vaccine rollout started last December. Oxford-AstraZeneca was the second to be approved and because it was quickly available in particularly large numbers, it became the predominant vaccine as the UK rollout started to work down the age groups. But when rare instances of blood clots in younger people were linked to the AstraZeneca jab, under-30s were told they wouild be offered Pfizer or Moderna vaccines rather than the AstraZeneca one. Since then the AstraZeneca vaccine has been largely used for the second vaccines of those people who were given that first time around. The UK regulator has now approved the use of thePfizer-BioNTech vaccine in children aged 12-15and the UK's vaccines committee will now decide whether children should get the jab. The UK's booster programme is due to start next monthbut no decision has been announced on whether this third jab must match someone's first or second jab. If that is what is decided, then Pfizer will be used to boost the immunity of the elderly and vulnerable groups who were first to receive it at the end of 2020 and start of this year. If you're just joining us, here's a quick round-up of the main headlines this lunchtime: Back to our main news that the UK has ordered another35m coronavirus vaccines from Pfizer-BioNTech.,external That's on top of an extra 60 million doses of the same jab it ordered in April as part of the vaccination booster programme in the autumn. This extra order means that Pfizer has now pulled well clear of the Oxford Astra-Zeneca vaccine that at one stage made up the biggest part of the government's pre-orders. The latest order count for each vaccine from the very start of the pandemic is: Add those figures up and the total is several times the entire population of the UK but of course some of those vaccines have yet to be approved for use in this country. You may remember that at the end of last year, before a single vaccine was produced, the government took an early approach of exploring as many avenues as possible in terms of immunisation options..  You can read more about the UK's vaccine programmehere. As we've been reporting today, a new NHS video featuring people in their 20s and 30s who suffer from long Covid is being used as part of effortsto encourage young people to get vaccinated. Infection rates are currently highest among younger adults, but so too is vaccine hesitancy, according to BBC health correspondent Dominic Hughes. Dr Joanne Herman, a consultant in infectious diseases, urges young people to get vaccinated against Covid to protect their long-term health. ""Adults may be unable to work, but children will be prevented from learning and I think it's such an important time, you don't want months in bed, you don't want months when you're unable to do your sport or go out dancing or do anything you want, you want to be in the prime of your life."" Staff and supply shortages have taken their toll on the UK's economic recovery this month, according to a closely watched survey. The IHS Markit/CIPS Composite Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) for August hit a six-month low of 55.3, falling from 59.2 in July. Any reading above 50 indicates growth, but the bounce-back from the pandemic is losing momentum, say researchers. Firms have complained that self-isolation requirements for contacts of people with Covid havemade it hard for them to maintain staffing levels. IHS Markit economist Chris Williamson says: ""Despite Covid-19 containment measures easing to the lowest since the pandemic began, rising virus case numbers are deterring many forms of spending, notably by consumers, and have hit growth via worsening staff and supply shortages."" He says supplier delays have risen to a degree exceeded only once before - in the initial months of the pandemic. ""The number of companies reporting that output had fallen due to staff or materials shortages has risenfar above anything ever seen previouslyin more than 20 years of survey history,"" Williamson adds. BBC MonitoringThe world through its media The Zimbabwe Congress of Trade Unions (ZCTU) has sued several companies for ordering employees to receive Covid-19 vaccines or risk the sack. In an urgent courtfiling cited,externalby privately-owned ZimLive website, ZCTU said the actions of the companies violated workersâ constitutional rights. âThere is no law in Zimbabwe making vaccination compulsory. Each person, having fully considered the implications and effects of vaccination, is expected to make a personal decision on whether or not to get vaccinated,â ZCTU argues in the court application. Public Service Minister Paul Mavhima and Attorney General Prince Machaya are also enjoined in the case. The Zimbabwe government, which has ordered all civil servants to get vaccinated, is targeting to inoculate at least 10 million of its approximately 15 million citizens by the end of this year. People have been working out longer and can fit exercise into their daily routine better since the start of the pandemic, industry figures show. PureGym's one million members now visit 1.43 times a week on average, compared with 1.21 before lockdown, while the 17:00-20:00 peak has ""quietened down"". Visits are also now spread across the day and later into the evening. And personal trainer Harley Edwards says she has seen a change, with 100 of her 150 clients exercising solely online. She started an online class in February 2020 and, after lockdown a month later, numbers watching soared to 300.

""I have members of my online group who had never exercised in their lives until lockdown, and now they would never give it up,""Harley says. BBC MonitoringThe world through its media Iran has recorded a further 38,657 positive cases and 610 Covid-related deaths, the country's health ministry says. New infections have risen slightly on Sunday's figure (36,419) but deaths have fallen from the 684 deaths reported yesterday. A further 5,108 people have been hospitalised. A total of 3,961,024 have recovered, while 7,695 patients are in critical condition. The ministry also says that 16,986,882 people have received at least one dose of a vaccine, while 6,150,817 people have received two doses, bringing the total number of administered doses to 23,137,699. James GallagherHealth and science correspondent, BBC News There are marked differences in your immune system after a natural infection with coronavirus and after vaccination. Which is better?

Both have become contentious issues. ""We could be digging ourselves into a hole, for a very long time, where we think we can only keep Covid away by boosting every year,"" Prof Eleanor Riley, an immunologist from the University of Edinburgh, tells me.

"Angela Merkel sought to reassure Ukraine's Volodymyr Zelensky over the Russian-led Nord Stream 2 project German Chancellor Angela Merkel has said further sanctions may be imposed on Russia if it uses a controversial gas pipeline against Ukraine. Mrs Merkel, on her final visit to Kyiv before leaving office, told Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky she understood his concerns over the Nord Stream 2 project. Mr Zelensky opposes the pipeline, which he says threatens Ukraine's security. It will run under the Baltic Sea and double Russian gas exports to Germany. Ukraine fears that the Russian-led Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline will tighten Moscow's grip over the region's energy supply and strengthen its influence. During a joint press conference on Sunday, Mr Zelensky described the project as a ""geopolitical weapon of the Kremlin"", which he said would be ""dangerous for all of Europe"". But Mrs Merkel, who is standing down as Germany's chancellor this autumn after 16 years in office, said Berlin agreed with Washington that Nord Stream 2 should not be used against Ukraine. She said sanctions could be used against Moscow under an agreement between Germany and the US, if gas was ""used as a weapon"". Mr Zelensky said he was concerned about what would happen in three years when the contract to deliver Russian gas through Ukrainian pipelines runs out. The loss of billions of dollars in transit fees would hit Ukraine's economy hard. Mrs Merkel, who held talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin on Friday, promised to provide more than a billion dollars to help expand Ukraine's renewable energy sector. Russia already supplies about 40% of the EU's gas - just ahead of Norway, which is not in the EU but takes part in its single market. The new pipeline will increase the amount of gas going under the Baltic to 55 billion cubic metres per year. Mrs Merkel has tried to assure Central and Eastern European states that the pipeline would not make Germany reliant on Russia for energy.

"A fifth of all gambling premises in the UK are now located in the poorest areas of the country, new research has found. Betting shops are 10 times more likely to be found in deprived towns than in affluent areas, according to a study by the University of Bristol. The areas with the highest number of betting shops per capita included Glasgow, Liverpool, London and Middlesbrough, the study found. This comes amid the government's ongoing review of the Gambling Act. A spokesman for the Gambling Commission - which is the government body that regulates gambling - said: ""Tackling gambling harm is a number one priority for the Gambling Commission. ""We will carefully consider the issues raised by any gambling-related research and any actions will be taken through the national strategy to reduce gambling harms."" 'I stole Â£70,000 to feed my gambling addiction' Paddy Power owner betting shops rebound 'Women don't need to feel shame about gambling addiction' Although the number has been declining in recent years, there were still more gambling sites in Britain than shops run by the big eight supermarket chains put together, said the study, which is supported by the Standard Life Foundation. The research highlights a disproportion between the amenities available on local High Streets for people living in deprived communities, compared to the amenities available in more affluent areas. For instance, just 10% of all food stores are located in the poorest areas, yet these places were home to as many as 34% of amusement arcades, 30% of bingo venues and 29% of adult gaming centres. In contrast, more affluent towns and cities had a much more even spread of services like libraries and supermarkets, the research showed. And half of UK gambling treatment centres can be found within a five-minute walk - 250 metres - of the nearest gambling premises, while nearly 10% of schools have a gambling venue within a five-minute walk - affecting 742,000 school pupils in more than 2,000 schools across the country. ""The research highlights the clear mismatch between the amenities available in 'left behind' areas, compared with those that are more affluent,"" said Jamie Evans, senior research associate at the University of Bristol. ""Rather than having greater access to the facilities, services and opportunities that help people to improve their lives, those in more deprived communities are disproportionately faced with choices that can often prove harmful. While the gambling industry may offer some much-needed employment in these areas, it usually takes much more than it gives, leaving a legacy of greater hardship and increased social problems."" Liz and Charles Ritchie started the Gambling With Lives charity after they lost their son Jack to suicide in 2017. They say that currently at least 500 young people die every year, having had a gambling addiction. Liz and Charles Ritchie's son Jack took his life in 2017. He began visiting betting shops during his school lunch break at age 17 ""Predatory gambling companies target the poor and the young. We know the tragic cost of this targeting - at least one death per day,"" Ms Ritchie told the BBC. ""Many of the young people we have lost... were enticed into gambling premises very near schools or on their bus routes home."" Mr Ritchie is concerned that the government is ""putting business before lives"". ""At the moment, local communities have so little say in opposing any planning,"" he said. ""We've been contacted by local communities who have had a terrible problem with this. People don't want betting shops."" The couple want to see local authorities and communities given much greater power to veto licences for betting shops, particularly if they are close to schools and other facilities used by young people. However the Betting and Gaming Council stressed that betting shops and casinos have made a ""huge economic contribution"" to the UK. A spokesman for the Betting and Gaming Council said: ""BGC members support 119,000 jobs, generate Â£4.5bn in tax to pay for vital public services and contribute Â£7.7bn to the economy in gross value added. ""Betting shops alone employ around 46,000 people across the country, pay Â£1bn in tax to the Treasury as well as Â£60m in business rates for local councils, while casinos employ 11,000 staff and pay Â£500m a year in tax."" The BBC understands that the government requires gambling premises to conduct local area risk assessments and explain how they are able to mitigate the risk of underage gambling. But Mr Evans says this is not good enough: ""While gambling premises may provide jobs, we know that gambling can lead to a wide variety of financial, social and health problems, with problem gambling affecting not just the gambler themselves but many of those closest to them as well. ""These are problems which simply add to the many challenges that our most deprived communities already face.""

"The UK has agreed a contract for 35 million more doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine The doses will be delivered from the second half of next year and will help ""future proof"" the UK's vaccination programme, the government says The US FDA has granted full approval to the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine for people aged 16 and over; previously it only had emergency approval Eighty-two private Covid travel test firms listed on No 10's website are warned over misleading prices, and 57 have been removed New Zealand's national lockdown has been extended, with Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern urging caution amid the Delta variant Taiwan has begun administering its first domestically developed Covid-19 vaccine, amid criticism that its approval was rushed Young long-Covid sufferers in the UK have urged others to get vaccinated against the virus The UK recorded 32,253 new infections and 49 more deaths within 28 days of a positive test on Sunday Edited by Hamish Mackay We're bringing our live coverage of the pandemic to a close for the day. Thanks for joining us, we'll be back tomorrow morning. Here's a recap of the day's main Covid news: The UK has recorded a further 31,914 new Covid-19 cases,Monday's official figures show.,external There have also been a further 40 deaths within 28 days of a positive test. Meanwhile, a further 40,345 first vaccine doses have been administered, as well as another 116,352 second doses. It means that 76.9% of over-16s in the UK have now been fully vaccinated, while 87.7% have had at least one dose. Reality Check As we reported earlier, coronavirus was the ninth biggest cause of death in England in July, up from the 26th most common cause in June. In Wales it was the 22nd leading cause of death, having been too low to rank the previous month. The total number of people dying rose back above the average levels for 2015 to 2019 in July. The number of deaths was 7.6% higher than average in England and 10.4% higher in Wales,figures from the Office for National Statistics,externalshow. Since the start of the pandemic in March 2020, Covid has been the number one cause of death in England and Wales for six months (April, May, November and December 2020 and January and February 2021). When there isn't a pandemic, the top causes of death are usually heart disease and dementia. The figures record the one condition named as the underlying cause of death. So, it does not include cases in which Covid was just mentioned on the death certificate as a contributory cause. They show the deaths registered in each period, not when the deaths actually occurred. Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst Thereâs a lot of focus in China today on one of the
countryâs top medical experts being cleared over academic misconduct. Zhang Wenhong is a renowned infectious disease expert who
is often nicknamed âChinaâs Dr Fauciâ. He is extremely popular in China
and has become of the countryâs most trusted voices on Covid-19. However, the national Global Times newspaper notes that
there were calls in early August to investigate his academic background, with
some on the popular Sina Weibo microblogclaiming that his doctorate paper showed signs of plagiarism.,external Fudan University, which is one of Chinaâs top universities,
subsequently said it would carry out an investigation into these claims, in
accordance with relevant academic standards. Today, the university has released the findings of these
results, and according to the national China Daily newspaper, has found that
âZhangâs doctoral dissertation had met the requirements for doctoral
dissertations at that timeâ. In a statement on its website,external, it says that his
work âdoes not constitute academic misconductâ. Given Dr Zhangâs popularity, many on Chinaâs Sina Weibo
social network are pleased with these results. Comments are rife on the
platform about how those that made âslanderousâ comments about him should
apologise or âbe held accountableâ for spreading online rumours. Global Times notes,externalthat recent criticism over Dr Zhang
might have been sparked by an early ""misinterpreted"" remark he had
made, that some saw as contradictory to China's official messaging on Covid-19. Cumbria's director of public health is urging tourists to take a lateral flow Covid test before visiting the county in north-west England. It follows a sharp increase in the number of coronavirus cases in the Eden district. There are now 387 cases per 100,000 people - double the number compared with the week before. Colin Cox says it is unclear whether tourism is a factor, but is urging people to check they are Covid-free before travelling and to continue wearing face coverings in public places. As we reported just now, police have been called to ITN's London headquarters after anti-vaccine protesters entered the building. We've got a bit more detail now from ITN. In a statement, a spokeswoman says police are attending a ""breach of security"" at its studios on Grays' Inn Road. ITN says it takes such breaches ""very seriously"" and that the safety of its staff and journalists is of ""paramount importance"". ""All personnel have been advised to either stay in the
building or stay away while the situation is being dealt with,"" the statement adds. Pfizer's two-dose Covid-19 vaccine has received full approval from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), becoming the first jab to be licensed in the US. The vaccine had initially been given emergency use authorisation. Its two jabs are now fully approved for those aged 16 and older. The approval is expected to set off more vaccine mandates by employers and organisations across the country. It comes amid lingering vaccine hesitancy among many Americans. In a statement, the FDA says its review for approval includes data from approximately 44,000 people. Acting FDA commissioner Janet Woodcock says that the public ""can be very confident"" the vaccine meets high safety, effectiveness and manufacturing quality standards. Read more on this story here. Abattoirs, butchers and meat processors are set to employ prisoners and ex-inmates to help plug 14,000 job vacancies. The Association of Independent Meat Suppliers (AIMS) tells the BBC that Covid has contributed to a looming ""recruitment crisis"". The industry body says businesses will seek to link up with prisons that contain prisoners who are part of the Release On Temporary Licence (ROTL) programme. It's a risk-assessed scheme that inmates in open prisons use to gain work experience to help them in their transition back into the community. Tony Goodger, from AIMS, says some members already employ inmates on ROTL, and have found them to be ""well behaved, hard-working, and willing to learn"". We've got more on this storyhere. A group of anti-vaccine protesters have entered ITN Production's London headquarters on Gray's Inn road, in Camden. In a statement posted on Twitter on Monday,external- and subsequently retweeted by ITN - the Metropolitan Police said officers were ""responding to a demonstration at a private premises on Grayâs Inn Road...where people have unlawfully gained access to the building"" and that police were ""engaging with building security and removing those who have gained entry"".

A Covid vaccination clinic that had to close because of an anti-vaccine protest will reopen later this week. The pop-up clinic inside Cabot Circus Shopping Centre in Bristol was shut when about 60 protesters gathered outside on Sunday afternoon. Avon and Somerset Police says the clinic closed ""for the welfare and safety of staff and patients"". In a statement, the NHS said it was ""disappointed"" that vaccinations had to be paused. Some of the protesters addressed shoppers outside the clinic using a megaphone, telling them not to get the vaccine. The pop-up clinic is due to re-open to people aged 16 and over on 27 and 28 August from 11:00 to 19:00 BST. Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst Chinaâs capital city Beijing has today relaxed
its remaining local lockdowns, meaning that life is somewhat back to normal for residents. There were fears of a widespread outbreak in
Beijing after a local case of Covid-19 was detected in the city on 28 July. Sporadic cases were subsequently reported, meaning that the city swiftly locked
down communities where people had tested positive, andimposed travel restrictions on people entering and leaving the city.,external Large-scale testing drives,externalinvolving millions of
people also took place. Almost three weeks ago, the cityâs government stressed that
all large-scale events throughout August should be cancelled,including the Beijing International Film Festival,external. Parks, cinemas and libraries were told to limit the number of visitors, and
many universities, including the prestigious Tsinghua University, announced
that they were suspending the start date of their new terms. But Beijing - which has population of around 21 million people - has not recorded any new symptomatic cases since 11 August,according to the official Xinhua News Agency,external, so the city has deemed it safe to lift its lockdowns. So we know that another 35m Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines are on order, on top of the 100m that have already been used or are on the way already - but who are they earmarked for? Because Prizer was the first vaccine to become available for use in the UK, that is what was given to the elderly and most vulnerable who were prioritised when the vaccine rollout started last December. Oxford-AstraZeneca was the second to be approved and because it was quickly available in particularly large numbers, it became the predominant vaccine as the UK rollout started to work down the age groups. But when rare instances of blood clots in younger people were linked to the AstraZeneca jab, under-30s were told they wouild be offered Pfizer or Moderna vaccines rather than the AstraZeneca one. Since then the AstraZeneca vaccine has been largely used for the second vaccines of those people who were given that first time around. The UK regulator has now approved the use of thePfizer-BioNTech vaccine in children aged 12-15and the UK's vaccines committee will now decide whether children should get the jab. The UK's booster programme is due to start next monthbut no decision has been announced on whether this third jab must match someone's first or second jab. If that is what is decided, then Pfizer will be used to boost the immunity of the elderly and vulnerable groups who were first to receive it at the end of 2020 and start of this year. If you're just joining us, here's a quick round-up of the main headlines this lunchtime: Back to our main news that the UK has ordered another35m coronavirus vaccines from Pfizer-BioNTech.,external That's on top of an extra 60 million doses of the same jab it ordered in April as part of the vaccination booster programme in the autumn. This extra order means that Pfizer has now pulled well clear of the Oxford Astra-Zeneca vaccine that at one stage made up the biggest part of the government's pre-orders. The latest order count for each vaccine from the very start of the pandemic is: Add those figures up and the total is several times the entire population of the UK but of course some of those vaccines have yet to be approved for use in this country. You may remember that at the end of last year, before a single vaccine was produced, the government took an early approach of exploring as many avenues as possible in terms of immunisation options..  You can read more about the UK's vaccine programmehere. As we've been reporting today, a new NHS video featuring people in their 20s and 30s who suffer from long Covid is being used as part of effortsto encourage young people to get vaccinated. Infection rates are currently highest among younger adults, but so too is vaccine hesitancy, according to BBC health correspondent Dominic Hughes. Dr Joanne Herman, a consultant in infectious diseases, urges young people to get vaccinated against Covid to protect their long-term health. ""Adults may be unable to work, but children will be prevented from learning and I think it's such an important time, you don't want months in bed, you don't want months when you're unable to do your sport or go out dancing or do anything you want, you want to be in the prime of your life."" Staff and supply shortages have taken their toll on the UK's economic recovery this month, according to a closely watched survey. The IHS Markit/CIPS Composite Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) for August hit a six-month low of 55.3, falling from 59.2 in July. Any reading above 50 indicates growth, but the bounce-back from the pandemic is losing momentum, say researchers. Firms have complained that self-isolation requirements for contacts of people with Covid havemade it hard for them to maintain staffing levels. IHS Markit economist Chris Williamson says: ""Despite Covid-19 containment measures easing to the lowest since the pandemic began, rising virus case numbers are deterring many forms of spending, notably by consumers, and have hit growth via worsening staff and supply shortages."" He says supplier delays have risen to a degree exceeded only once before - in the initial months of the pandemic. ""The number of companies reporting that output had fallen due to staff or materials shortages has risenfar above anything ever seen previouslyin more than 20 years of survey history,"" Williamson adds. BBC MonitoringThe world through its media The Zimbabwe Congress of Trade Unions (ZCTU) has sued several companies for ordering employees to receive Covid-19 vaccines or risk the sack. In an urgent courtfiling cited,externalby privately-owned ZimLive website, ZCTU said the actions of the companies violated workersâ constitutional rights. âThere is no law in Zimbabwe making vaccination compulsory. Each person, having fully considered the implications and effects of vaccination, is expected to make a personal decision on whether or not to get vaccinated,â ZCTU argues in the court application. Public Service Minister Paul Mavhima and Attorney General Prince Machaya are also enjoined in the case. The Zimbabwe government, which has ordered all civil servants to get vaccinated, is targeting to inoculate at least 10 million of its approximately 15 million citizens by the end of this year. People have been working out longer and can fit exercise into their daily routine better since the start of the pandemic, industry figures show. PureGym's one million members now visit 1.43 times a week on average, compared with 1.21 before lockdown, while the 17:00-20:00 peak has ""quietened down"". Visits are also now spread across the day and later into the evening. And personal trainer Harley Edwards says she has seen a change, with 100 of her 150 clients exercising solely online. She started an online class in February 2020 and, after lockdown a month later, numbers watching soared to 300. She says about 80% of her clients are mums who are now able to fit working out around their lifestyle better - logging on before or after work, or when childcare allows. ""I have members of my online group who had never exercised in their lives until lockdown, and now they would never give it up,""Harley says. BBC MonitoringThe world through its media Iran has recorded a further 38,657 positive cases and 610 Covid-related deaths, the country's health ministry says. New infections have risen slightly on Sunday's figure (36,419) but deaths have fallen from the 684 deaths reported yesterday. A further 5,108 people have been hospitalised. A total of 3,961,024 have recovered, while 7,695 patients are in critical condition. The ministry also says that 16,986,882 people have received at least one dose of a vaccine, while 6,150,817 people have received two doses, bringing the total number of administered doses to 23,137,699.

"Taliban violence against protesters is increasing, the UN human rights organisation says The agency called on the Islamist group to stop using force, and allow peaceful demonstrations A second international flight carrying passengers leaving Afghanistan has now departed from Kabul airport The first flight to carry foreigners since the US pullout left on Thursday US officials described the Taliban co-operation as businesslike and professional Saturday will be the 20th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks in the US - which triggered a two-decade conflict in Afghanistan Edited by Tiffany Wertheimer We're now pausing our live coverage of the latest developments in and around Afghanistan - thanks for staying with us. Just to recap, here are the main headlines in the past 24 hours:  You can still follow all the latest developments on major news stories on theBBC News website. BBC OS A US flag is seen posted in the rubble of the World Trade Center in New York, two days after the attack there The BBC is covering the 20th anniversary of the 11 September 2001 attacks in the US, which led to the 20-year conflict in Afghanistan. This is the story of Chris Cruz, who explains in an interview to BBC's OS programme why he decided to join the US army. ""My mother was heading to work on a normal 11 September day. As soon as she exited the subway, she was told to start running as the buildings were coming down. She literally saw them coming down and described people jumping out of the windows,"" says Chris. ""When she finally made it home, I - as an 11-year-old boy at the time - had to tell her that she had burn marks and blood spots on the back of her legs. She was in a state of shock. ""As I grew up, I realised... I had the ability to be part of an organisation that could defend and prevent these atrocities for all Americans. ""9/11 played a role, but not in a way of revenge. I didn't want to join out of bloodlust. I served two tours in Afghanistan. Both of those times I volunteered to go. ""I don't think our mission would have succeeded without our Afghan partners. I agree we couldn't be there forever, but we made a promise to keep our partners safe and that we wouldn't turn our backs on them, and that's exactly what we've done."" Chris adds: ""I do think the way we pulled out, the way we left it, was completely wrong. There needed to be a better exit strategy."" New York Republican representative Lee Zeldin says it is âinfuriatingâ
that the Taliban are âback in controlâ of Afghanistan two decades after the
September 11 attacks. In an interview with Fox News, Zeldin, 41 - who joined the US
Army in 2003 and later deployed to Iraq - said he âcouldnât get on active
duty fast enoughâ following the attacks. âI vividly remember the sounds, the visuals, the motions,
the yellow ribbons on all the trees on the streets, the flags going up from home to home â a sense of patriotism and unity I had never
experienced at any other point in my life,â he said. Zeldin said he believed the US withdrawal
from Afghanistan would create a âpath towards leaving our nation more
domestically vulnerable to threatsâ. âCreating a nation as a safe haven of terrorism, and likely
allowing the rise of groups like al-Qaeda and IS, that has ramifications
beyond Afghanistanâs borders,â he said.  Nine out of 10 households in Afghanistan are not getting enough to eat, the World Food Programme has warned. Regional director Anthea Webb said that after the Taliban took power on 15 August, ""the portion of families resorting to extreme coping mechanisms, like skipping meals or preferring to give food to children instead of adults or limiting portion sizes had almost doubled"". The findings were based on phone calls to 1,600 random households between 17 June and 5 September. An international conference on aid to Afghanistan is due to take place on Monday and Webb called on donors to respond to an appeal for $200m. Food prices had risen sharply even before the Taliban takeover due a drought. Afghanistan is in an acute economic situation after Western powers suspended foreign aid, and the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) also halted payments. Pakistan has been delivering aid A former US Ambassador to Afghanistan has told BBC News the ""stunning"" retreat of US forces ""pulled the plumbing"" out of Afghan security forces. Karl Eikenberry described the situation as ""a house of cards militarily and politically"", and said the way the Afghan army had been developed by the United States had left it dependent on US intelligence, technology and firepower, which contributed to the rapid collapse in control. This video can not be played Karl Eikenberry described the collapse of Afghanistan's government as a ""house of cards"" Women playing cricket in Herat in 2015 Afghanistan Cricket Board chief Hamid Shinwari has pleaded with Australia not to cancel an upcoming match in Hobart over the Taliban's attitude to women in sport. Taliban officials have suggested they could ban women playing sport. Cricket Australia  said it would have to cancel a men's test against Afghanistan in Hobart on 27 November if women were banned. Mr Shinwari issued a statement saying that ""cricket diplomacy"" was preferable to a ""knee-jerk"" reaction. And he suggested that Taliban comments on the participation of women in cricket were not substantially different from the ""cultural and religious environment"" under the previous Ghani and Karzai governments. Mr Shinwari called on ""Cricket Australia and the whole cricketing world to keep the door open for us"". A Taliban official earlier toldAustralia's SBS,externalnews that sport was ""not necessary"" and ""in cricket, they might face a situation where their face and body will not be covered"".

Ms Farid said she still felt part of Afghanistan and wanted to ""stand for the freedom of women"". She spoke to the BBC's Chief International Correspondent Lyse Doucet. A second international civilian charter flight has just taken off from Kabul airport, headed for Doha. It is currently unclear how many people are on the flight, or their nationalities. It comes after more than 100 people, including US and UK nationals, were flown out of Afghanistan on Thursday. Qatari officials, who have been assisting the Taliban to reopen the airport, say it is up and running again. The Taliban say regular commercial flights will resume soon. As we've reported, the Taliban has declared victory in the Panjshir Valley, the final pocket of territory which remained outside their rule.

Caught in the middle of the fighting are the citizens of Panjshir - some of whom are reported to have fled into the surrounding mountains to escape the violence, according to Afghanistan's Tolo News agency who quote Panjshir residents in Kabul.

Ken McCallum told the BBCthat while the terror threat would not change overnight, there could be a ""morale boost"" for extremists. Fears over the link between the Taliban takeover and terrorism have also been expressed by UN chief Antonio Guterres. In an interview with AFP news agency, he was asked about the risks of an Afghanistan-like scenario happening in West Africa's Sahel region, where Islamist groups are waging insurgencies. Guterres said there was a ""real danger"" that some ""terrorist groups may feel enthusiastic about what happened and have ambitions beyond what they thought a few months ago"". He said he was worried about fanatical groups where death ""is desirable"", and that it was ""essential to reinforce security mechanisms in the Sahel"".

The BBC will also be reflecting on the 20th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks in the US, and how they defined the 20-year conflict. Our correspondents will be reporting from New York, Kabul, Guantanamo Bay and elsewhere. Here are some of the biggest updates we've been covering on Friday:  As we reported earlier, the first civilian charter flight from Afghanistan since the US pullout from the country arrived in Doha on Thursday night. Qatar Airways flew more than 100 foreign nationals from Kabul to Doha. They included 13 Britons and up to 30 Americans. The US said the Taliban had shown flexibility, and been ""business-like and professional"" in facilitating the departure of American citizens. More than 100 people were on the flight headed to Doha and included families with children This is the first commercial international flight to leave Kabul since the airlift was suspended at the end of August Some international flights have been in and out before, but largely carrying aid and technicians who were part of the team helping to get Kabul's airport operational again Russia will not take part ""in any way"" in the Taliban government's inauguration ceremony in Afghanistan, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov has said. ""We do not know how this situation will develop. That is why we say that it is important for us to understand what the first and subsequent steps of the current leadership of Afghanistan will be,"" he said. Earlier in the week, the speaker of Russia's upper house of parliament said Russia would be represented at the
inauguration by ambassador-level officials, the RIA news agency had reported. On Thursday, President Vladimir Putin said Russia was in talks with the Taliban to facilitate the evacuation
from Afghanistan of nationals of other countries. ""Many are asking us to help bring out of Afghanistan
nationals of third countries, as well as some Afghans. We are not doing this
covertly; we too are in talks with Taliban leaders in relation to certain
categories of people and we are doing this,"" he told a news conference in Moscow. Gordon CoreraSecurity correspondent, BBC News For the past two decades, terrorism has dominated MI5's work. But with significant shifts over time. It took the attacks of 7 July 2005 for it to fully understand the threat came from within as well as abroad. By the 10th anniversary of 9/11, the sense was that the threat from al-Qaeda might be receding and MI5 could turn to other issues of concern, such as state espionage. But then the Islamic State group emerged out of Iraq and Syria and a new wave started - less sophisticated and organised but still deadly. Once again, in the last couple of years, there was a hope that this jihadist threat might be slowing as MI5 took on extreme-right wing activity and focused more on Russia and China. But recent events have raised concerns that the jihadist threat could evolve once again, with Afghanistan inspiring people to act, or by the Western withdrawal creating a new safe haven for groups to operate in and plan more sophisticated attacks, as they did in the years around 9/11. MI5 boss warns of Afghanistan 'morale boost' for extremists The UN rights office says the Taliban have been ""increasingly violent"" against protesters, using live ammunition, batons and whips. Spokesperson Ravina Shamdasani told a briefing in Geneva that the agency had received credible reports that at least four people had been killed at protests in recent days. Protesters have also been beaten and detained. In addition to violence against protesters, the UN said the Taliban had been increasingly using force against those reporting on the demonstrations. Earlier this week, the Taliban issued an order prohibiting ""unauthorised assemblies"". ""Rather than banning peaceful protests, the Taliban should cease the use of force and ensure the freedom of peaceful assembly and expression, including as a means for people to voice their concerns and exercise their right to participate in public affairs,"" the UN rights office said. Click here to read more about how journalists have been beaten, detained and flogged by the Taliban when attempting to cover protests Some of the Afghans evacuated to Australia who have now left hotel quarantine say they are grateful for their escape, but worry about those left behind. ""We have seen a few children who have come with heavy
trauma,"" aid worker Assadullah Khurrami told Reuters. ""The evacuees are very grateful... but
at the same time there is a lot of desperation, a lot of sadness
in these families, in these individuals, because they still have
loved ones and family members left in Afghanistan."" One such refugee is Amena - a member of the Hazara ethnic group which has been persecuted by extremists - who managed to escape on one of the last evacuation flights, but was forced to leave her family behind at Kabul airport. âThey caught my brothers, my parents and stopped them from moving beyond the gate. I was on one side of the gate, they were on the other. The Taliban had guns, they were hitting people,â she told SBS News. While Amena had a visa to Australia, the rest of her family didn't. They're now in hiding in Kabul, unable to return home to rural Afghanistan because it has been taken by the Taliban. Australia managed to evacuate a total of 4,100 people from Kabul after it fell to the Taliban. Pakistan's role in the recent events has been much disputed. It has led to anti-Pakistan protests in the Afghan capital. On the other hand, some Western powers seeking to influence the new Taliban government, are hoping that Pakistan could play a role as a mediator. Pakistan's foreign minister on Friday said he wanted peace and prosperity in Afghanistan, while calling for a humanitarian crisis there to be averted. In a statement reported by local media, Shah Mehmood Qureshi said Pakistan was committed to helping Afghanistan, despite having limited resources. He said Pakistan had sent medicine and food to Kabul on Thursday, and urged other countries to take action too. And he added: ""We should encourage the Taliban not to allow their land to be used against any other country."" Anti-Pakistan protestshave been held in Kabul this week, with many Afghans believing the country supports the Taliban. Claims have emerged that in recent days Pakistani drones have been used to help the Taliban, by targeting anti-Taliban positions. The claims have been dismissed by Pakistan, as well as by the Taliban. A spokesman for the Pakistani armed forces, Gen Babar Iftikhar, told the BBC they were ""complete lies"".

"Taliban violence against protesters is increasing, the UN human rights organisation says The agency called on the Islamist group to stop using force, and allow peaceful demonstrations A second international flight carrying passengers leaving Afghanistan has now departed from Kabul airport The first flight to carry foreigners since the US pullout left on Thursday US officials described the Taliban co-operation as businesslike and professional Saturday will be the 20th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks in the US - which triggered a two-decade conflict in Afghanistan Edited by Tiffany Wertheimer We're now pausing our live coverage of the latest developments in and around Afghanistan - thanks for staying with us. Just to recap, here are the main headlines in the past 24 hours:  You can still follow all the latest developments on major news stories on theBBC News website. BBC OS A US flag is seen posted in the rubble of the World Trade Center in New York, two days after the attack there The BBC is covering the 20th anniversary of the 11 September 2001 attacks in the US, which led to the 20-year conflict in Afghanistan. This is the story of Chris Cruz, who explains in an interview to BBC's OS programme why he decided to join the US army. ""My mother was heading to work on a normal 11 September day. As soon as she exited the subway, she was told to start running as the buildings were coming down. She literally saw them coming down and described people jumping out of the windows,"" says Chris. ""When she finally made it home, I - as an 11-year-old boy at the time - had to tell her that she had burn marks and blood spots on the back of her legs. She was in a state of shock. ""As I grew up, I realised... I had the ability to be part of an organisation that could defend and prevent these atrocities for all Americans. ""9/11 played a role, but not in a way of revenge. I didn't want to join out of bloodlust. I served two tours in Afghanistan. Both of those times I volunteered to go. ""I don't think our mission would have succeeded without our Afghan partners. I agree we couldn't be there forever, but we made a promise to keep our partners safe and that we wouldn't turn our backs on them, and that's exactly what we've done."" Chris adds: ""I do think the way we pulled out, the way we left it, was completely wrong. There needed to be a better exit strategy."" New York Republican representative Lee Zeldin says it is âinfuriatingâ
that the Taliban are âback in controlâ of Afghanistan two decades after the
September 11 attacks. In an interview with Fox News, Zeldin, 41 - who joined the US
Army in 2003 and later deployed to Iraq - said he âcouldnât get on active
duty fast enoughâ following the attacks. âI vividly remember the sounds, the visuals, the motions,
the yellow ribbons on all the trees on the streets, the flags going up from home to home â a sense of patriotism and unity I had never
experienced at any other point in my life,â he said. Zeldin said he believed the US withdrawal
from Afghanistan would create a âpath towards leaving our nation more
domestically vulnerable to threatsâ. âCreating a nation as a safe haven of terrorism, and likely
allowing the rise of groups like al-Qaeda and IS, that has ramifications
beyond Afghanistanâs borders,â he said.  Nine out of 10 households in Afghanistan are not getting enough to eat, the World Food Programme has warned. Regional director Anthea Webb said that after the Taliban took power on 15 August, ""the portion of families resorting to extreme coping mechanisms, like skipping meals or preferring to give food to children instead of adults or limiting portion sizes had almost doubled"". The findings were based on phone calls to 1,600 random households between 17 June and 5 September. An international conference on aid to Afghanistan is due to take place on Monday and Webb called on donors to respond to an appeal for $200m. Food prices had risen sharply even before the Taliban takeover due a drought. Afghanistan is in an acute economic situation after Western powers suspended foreign aid, and the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) also halted payments. Pakistan has been delivering aid A former US Ambassador to Afghanistan has told BBC News the ""stunning"" retreat of US forces ""pulled the plumbing"" out of Afghan security forces. Karl Eikenberry described the situation as ""a house of cards militarily and politically"", and said the way the Afghan army had been developed by the United States had left it dependent on US intelligence, technology and firepower, which contributed to the rapid collapse in control. This video can not be played Karl Eikenberry described the collapse of Afghanistan's government as a ""house of cards"" Women playing cricket in Herat in 2015 Afghanistan Cricket Board chief Hamid Shinwari has pleaded with Australia not to cancel an upcoming match in Hobart over the Taliban's attitude to women in sport. Taliban officials have suggested they could ban women playing sport. Cricket Australia  said it would have to cancel a men's test against Afghanistan in Hobart on 27 November if women were banned. Mr Shinwari issued a statement saying that ""cricket diplomacy"" was preferable to a ""knee-jerk"" reaction. And he suggested that Taliban comments on the participation of women in cricket were not substantially different from the ""cultural and religious environment"" under the previous Ghani and Karzai governments. Mr Shinwari called on ""Cricket Australia and the whole cricketing world to keep the door open for us"". A Taliban official earlier toldAustralia's SBS,externalnews that sport was ""not necessary"" and ""in cricket, they might face a situation where their face and body will not be covered"".

Ms Farid said she still felt part of Afghanistan and wanted to ""stand for the freedom of women"". She spoke to the BBC's Chief International Correspondent Lyse Doucet. A second international civilian charter flight has just taken off from Kabul airport, headed for Doha. It is currently unclear how many people are on the flight, or their nationalities. It comes after more than 100 people, including US and UK nationals, were flown out of Afghanistan on Thursday. Qatari officials, who have been assisting the Taliban to reopen the airport, say it is up and running again. The Taliban say regular commercial flights will resume soon. As we've reported, the Taliban has declared victory in the Panjshir Valley, the final pocket of territory which remained outside their rule. However anti-Taliban resistance fighters have denied that, and said they were still present in ""all strategic positions"" in the province.

"This video can not be played Long Covid means brushing my hair can be ""emotionally traumatising"", says Megan Higgins Young people have shared stories of the debilitating effects of long Covid as they urge others to get jabbed. A new NHS video features the experiences of three previously healthy people as part of a drive to encourage vaccine uptake. Quincy Dwamena, 31, said he delayed his jab and ""ended up being hospitalised and thought I was going to die"". It comes as the government says it has met itstarget of offering all 16 and 17-year-olds in England a Covid jab. More than 360,000 people in this age group in England have now been given a first dose of the vaccine. They are being invited to book an appointment with their GP or visit a walk-in centre. In thevideo to encourage young people to get vaccinated,,externalMr Dwamena, from East London, described himself as a ""healthy young guy"" who ""went to the gym often"" and delayed getting the vaccine and became seriously ill. He said: ""My advice is to get the vaccine: don't put yourself and others at risk, I wish I'd got mine as soon as it was offered."" What do young people need to know about the vaccine? Should all children get a vaccine? How many people have been vaccinated so far? What are the symptoms of long Covid? Megan Higgins, 25, and Ella Harwood, 23, were both previously healthy and active but are now suffering with extreme fatigue due to long Covid. Ms Higgins, a special needs tutor from London, said that eight months on she still ""can't even walk around the shops without getting exhausted"". She told BBC Breakfast on bad days she experiences all over joint pain and ""that feeling of being absolutely exhausted from when you wake up to when you go to sleep"". ""One of the things I really notice is my emotional resilienceâ¦ when you're that tired everything hits you so much harder,"" she said. ""I had a knot at the end of my hair and trying to comb it out I remember getting so upset because I couldn't keep my hands above my head long enough to pick at the knot. ""I remember getting so frustrated that I wasn't strong enough to do it. I wasn't aware enough or awake enough. Something as silly as brushing your hair out can be emotionally really quite traumatising."" She said it was ""definitely worth getting the coronavirus vaccine... because the long-term effects can be more devastating than the actual short-term virus for some people."" ""For about seven months solid I genuinely thought I might die that year,"" says Ella Harwood Ms Harwood, an illustrator from London, said she was bed-bound for seven months and fears she will ""never be the same again"". She said: ""I was fit and healthy I had literally no conditions. I was doing exercise and for about seven months solid and I genuinely though I might die that year."" She added: ""My advice to anyone really, young and old, would be to get the vaccine because it's a naive way of thinking that you're invincible just because you're fit and healthy and you eat the right stuff."" This video can not be played Itâs been more than a year, will I ever recover? - BBC reporter Lucy Adams explored long Covid in a Panorama film The Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) said more than a million letters and texts were sent out in the three weekssince the age group became eligible for a jab. All those aged 12 to 15 and considered at-risk in England have also been invited for a vaccination, the government said. Letters have been sent to all 16 and 17 year olds in Wales inviting them for their jab. In Scotland, everyone aged 16 and overcan register to get the vaccine on the NHS inform website,externalor by calling 0800 030 8013. In Northern Ireland, older teenagers canbook online,externalor call 0300 200 7813. Walk-in centres are also open. According to thelatest figures,external, more than 47.6 million people in the UK - about 87% of over-16s - have now received at least one vaccine, with more than 41.6 million - 76% - having had both jabs. On Sunday 32,253 new Covid cases were reported across the UK, as well as a further 49 deaths within 28 days of a positive test. While the younger a person is the lower their overall risk from coronavirus, young adults can still get long Covid - which is when symptoms of the disease persist for an extended period. The latest figures for England show people aged 18 to 34 now make up more than a fifth of those admitted to hospital with the virus, four times higher than at the peak last winter, and most of those are unvaccinated. 'Harrowing stories' Having two doses of the vaccine approximately halves the risk of experiencing symptoms which last more than 28 days after becoming infected, according to research from King's College London. Health Secretary Sajid Javid said: ""Regardless of whether you're young, fit and healthy, these harrowing stories really show that Covid-19 can affect anyone. ""I encourage everyone to come forward for both their jabs as quickly as possible as vaccines are the best way to protect yourself and your loved ones from serious illness."" The government has been pushing to increase vaccine uptake among young people, with companies such as Asda and Deliveroooffering incentivesto those who get a jab. Meanwhile, pop-up vaccine sites have been opened across the country at sites such as London-based nightclub Heaven, as well as football stadiums and festivals.

"A week after the Taliban takeover of the country, many Afghans are uncertain of what it will mean for their lives and their safety. Here, a young female student shares her fears about her future. The BBC is not identifying her to protect her safety. ""It is the seventh day since the country collapsed, the president escaped, and the Taliban, once again, came to power. We are left behind... Fear has taken over my whole being, and as the days pass, I can feel how hope fades away from within me. It gets replaced with frustration. All I can see is darkness, uncertainty, and a not so bright future. I will be killed certainly. I have reasons to be... This is how it feels when the ones you are afraid of occupy the country. Imagine being on a long road, with no end, with hazy weather; alone. I have witnessed so many hurdles in my life, many that no other girl would be able to tolerate. I could manage to overcome them, but this... Hey world, do you care what happens here? Do we matter to you? Do you see us? Do you? For those who are listening, for those who care, I am writing this. I am saying this. We are suffering here, we are being left behind. Living with fear is no less than death. It is worse. If you are listening to us, help us. Help us survive, and once again believe in light and rise; stronger than before. We want our country back. Want our people to live the way they want, the way they deserve. Tell your countries to stop war - war is ugly, it has a dirty face, it has no winner. The heart is too tiny to bear war, to bear its consequences. We are the fruit of war, some young girls drown in uncertainties, in fear, in doubts... looking for somebody to help us survive. Looking at our families and crying for being unable to do anything. Looking at the sky and asking from him: do you see us, will you help us? Shall I have hope, that little hope! Hey world, hey people living out there, lucky you! I envy the life you live. Look at us. I was the one with so many big dreams, dreams of helping others and now I am seeking help. This is war. Will I be able to ever say: We did it? We could make it? Will I?""
