"Gareth Bale was an unused substitute in Real Madrid's Champions League final win over Liverpool last month Gareth Bale has joined Los Angeles FC on a 12-month deal following his departure from Real Madrid, saying: ""I cannot wait to get started."" The Wales captain, 32, has signed as a free agent after nine years in Spain with an option to stay there for the 2024 season. ""I am extremely excited for this move to LAFC,"" said Bale. ""This is the right place for me and my family and the right time in my career."" LAFC co-president John Thorrington said: ""Gareth is one of the most dynamic and exciting players of his generation ""Adding a player who brings his talent and experience at the highest levels is an incredible opportunity to improve our club. ""I am grateful to Gareth's management team who helped make this happen. ""It is clear that Gareth is highly motivated to continue to win trophies and we are elated that he has made the choice to join LAFC and help lead us in our ultimate goal of winning championships."" LAFC head coach Steve Cherundolo said: ""There are simply not many players in the world who can have an impact on a match like Gareth Bale. ""He can be dangerous in so many different ways, and we expect him to complement what we believe is already a strong team from the moment he arrives. ""His knowledge of the game and experience in playing in big games will be invaluable."" Thorrington earlier said negotiations with Bale had not been ""a financial conversation"". He added: ""Our transfer window opens in early July when we can register [players]. We still have to go through paperwork, hopefully a week or the next 10 days to take care of that, to welcome him and his family to LA, get up to speed."" The final chapter? Why Bale chose Los Angeles FC How Gareth Bale has gone from hero to forgotten man World Cup qualification 'greatest result' in Welsh football history, says Bale On Sunday Thorrington had expressed the wish for Bale's stay to run beyond November's World Cup in Qatar, where Wales will be making their first appearance at a finals since 1958. ""It was never about six months just for the World Cup. We were always talking about longer term than that. That was very clear from Gareth and his representative,"" he said. ""When Gareth is looking at what he needs to do, his priority will be at LAFC - we are absolutely sure of that - but we're not naive to the fact that he, like some other players of ours, have a World Cup on the horizon."" Thorrington, who is also Los Angeles FC's general manager, said that Bale's first game for the MLS side could potentially be the home derby against LA Galaxy at 03:00 BST on 9 July. The five-time Champions League winner had been linked with a return to Tottenham Hotspur as well as a move to home-city club Cardiff. The signing of Bale, who joined Real Madrid for a then world-record fee of Â£85m in 2013, follows LAFC'smove for Italy defender Giorgio Chielliniearlier this month. ""We presented to them what we feel is an unique opportunity for them at a stage of their career to do something different,"" Thorrington said. ""But we want to win and we want winners, and we have a guy who's won five Champions Leagues and a guy who's won the World Cup [Chiellini]. ""We have two great players who will continue to do great things in the next phase of their career here. ""We see them being great influences on the guys we already have here.""

There was speculation that Bale would end his playing career had Wales missed out on qualification for the 2022 World Cup. But after Robert Page's side booked their place in Qatar by beating Ukraine in their World Cup play-off final earlier this month, the only question about Bale's future was which club he would join. There had been suggestions Bale would opt to join Cardiff, with his agents confirming last week that they hadheld talks with the Welsh club, and the Championship team's owner Vincent Tan believes he may yet one day play for his hometown club. 'We were very very keen and of course he would have been a big coup for us and it would be great for Gareth Bale if he could play for his hometown,"" Malaysian businessman Tan told Talksport before Bale's move was confirmed. ""And of course all the Welsh would be very happy if Gareth Bale returned home and played in Cardiff. ""Unfortunately I think the LAFC offer was probably too attractive for him to turn down. ""But actually, originally he really wanted to come. The money wasn't the matter but we still tried to come up with what we thought would be a good offer to him. ""But finally it's very hard to compete when there is a lot of big American advertisers, the commercial deals there are very good for Gareth Bale. ""So we tried our best but we failed."" Asked if he would try again in the future to sign Bale, Tan said: ""His contract runs for 12 months, let's see what happens. Maybe by then Gareth will probably want to come back."" Cardiff share a training ground with the Football Association of Wales, which would have allowed Bale to continue working closely with Wales' medical and fitness staff while on club duty had he opted to join the Bluebirds. However, he is instead heading for the MLS, where the season runs from February until October and the competition's secondary transfer window opens on 7 July. This video can not be played Gareth Bale needs regular games next season, says Wales boss Robert Page ""We have done incredible diligence and it was an open, transparent conversation and we quickly saw it was a right match in the face of stiff competition worldwide - and he [Bale] agreed and we're excited to welcome him in the next couple of weeks,"" Thorrington said. ""It wasn't a financial conversation with Gareth or us. If Gareth was making this decision with financial motives he wouldn't be in MLS. ""This league is really exciting globally and he saw an opportunity to make a real impact. He sees here an opportunity to make a difference with the stage we provide. ""He sees the chance to pull this sport up to competing with the other sports. ""As much as possible... understanding how to manage a player like Gareth, a Ferrari or thoroughbred racehorse, they need extra attention in order to succeed, we're confident we'll be able to do that. ""The benefit of him joining the group we have, we will have a player who can play as much as he can, but we will do so sensibly. ""His priority will be at LAFC, but we're not naive - he has a World Cup on the horizon and how we manage his preparation ahead of the World Cup will be important to Gareth and the success of LA, but we want him peaking after the game with the US! ""The exact preparation he needs will be the same for us as it is for the World Cup, which I know for Wales is an historic one."" Wales will head to Qatar in November, where they will face the USA, Iran and England in Group B at the World Cup. LAFC are currently top of the MLS' Western Conference and have 18 regular-season games to play. When asked what Bale and Chiellini will bring to his squad, Cherundolo said: ""Having been on phone calls and zooms with Gareth Bale and Chiellini, I know 100% they are here for the right reasons. ""I hope he [Bale] will bring what he brought to Tottenham, Real Madrid - goals, assists, constant threat - a prolific player who knows how to win championships."" The end-of-season play-offs follow, with the season-ending MLS Cup final to be played on 5 November - 16 days before Wales' World Cup campaign begins with a game against the USA.

"Russia is believed to have defaulted on its debt for the first time since 1998 after missing a key deadline. Russia has the money to make a $100m payment, which was due on Sunday, but sanctions made it impossible to get the sum to international creditors. The country had been determined to avoid the default, which is a major blow to the nation's prestige. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov, said ""statements of a default were absolutely unjustified"". He added that an intermediary bank had withheld the money and that the reserves were blocked ""unlawfully"". The White House said that Russia had defaulted on paying yields on its international bonds, crediting sanctions for effectively cutting Russia off from the global financial system. Russia's finance minister called the situation ""a farce"" and said the situation is not expected to have short-term impact. This is because Russia does not need to raise money internationally as it is reaping revenue from high-priced commodities such as oil, according to Chris Weafer, chief executive at Moscow-based consultancy Macro Advisory. But he said it would create a ""legacy"" problem if the situation with Ukraine and international sanctions improves. ""This is the sort of action that will hang over the economy and make recovery much more difficult when we get to that stage,"" he said. The $100m interest payment was due on 27 May. Russia says the money was sent to Euroclear, a bank which would then distribute the payment to investors. But that payment has been stuck there,according to Bloomberg News,external, and creditors have not received it. Meanwhile, some Taiwanese holders of Russian bonds denominated in euros have not received interest payments, according to the Reuters news agency, which cited two sources. The money had not arrived within 30 days of the due date, that is, Sunday evening, and so is considered a default. Euroclear would not say if the payment had been blocked, but said it adhered to all sanctions, introduced following Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Russia disputed that it had defaulted on the debt. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said it had made the payments due in May, and the fact that it was blocked by Euroclear because of sanctions was ""not our problem."" Russia's economy in for a bumpy ride as sanctions bite What sanctions are being imposed on Russia over Ukraine invasion? Russia finance minister Anton Siluanov admitted foreign investors would ""not be able to receive"" the payments, according to the RIA Novosti news wire. Because Russia wants to pay and has plenty of money to do it, he denied that this amounts to a genuine default, which usually occur when governments refuse to pay, or their economies are so weak that they cannot find the money. ""Everyone in the know understands that this is not a default at all. This whole situation looks like a farce."" Defaulting nations usually find it impossible to borrow any more money, but Russia is already in effect barred from borrowing in Western markets by sanctions. Also, Russia is reportedly earning about $1bn a day from fossil fuel exports, and its finance minister Anton Siluanov said in April the country had no plans to borrow more. The default will trigger repayments on a large chunk of Russia's debt, according to Mr Weafer. About $40bn of Russia's debts are denominated in dollars or euros, with around half held outside the country. ""Some parts of that debt will now become automatically due because there will be early repayment clauses in all debt instruments so if you default on one it usually triggers the immediate demand for payment on the other debts, so Russia could certainly face immediate debt repayment of about $20bn at this stage,"" he told the BBC's Today programme. Russian finance minister Anton Siluanov says the so-called default is a farce"" Russia's last debt default of any kind was in 1998 as the country was rocked by the rouble crisis during the chaotic end of Boris Yeltsin's regime. At the time Moscow failed to keep up payments on its domestic bonds and defaulted on some overseas debt. Russia has seemed on an inevitable path to default since sanctions were first imposed by the US and European Union following the invasion of Ukraine. These restricted the country's access to the international banking networks which would process payments from Russia to investors around the world. The Russian government has said it wants to make all of its payments on time, and up until now it had succeeded. Default seemed inevitable when the US Treasury decided not to renew the special exemption in sanctions rules allowing investors to receive interest payments from Russia, which expired on 25 May. The Kremlin now appears to have accepted this inevitability too, decreeing on 23 June stating that all future debt payments would be made in roubles through a Russian bank, the National Settlements Depository, even when contracts state they should be in dollars or other international currencies. Meanwhile, Mr Weafer, who is based in Moscow, said that life was more or less operating as normal despite sanctions and Western companies withdrawing from Russia. ""If you're in Moscow right now frankly, if you weren't reading the newspapers, you'd see there's been a price increase but otherwise life is as it was before February 24. ""In March and April there was a lot of concern that products would disappear, that factories would not be able to get components or materials to continue operating and we could be looking therefore at a severe drop in employment or a rise in unemployment by the summer [or] early autumn. That situation has improved,"" he added. ""We've seen alternative import routes opening via Kazakhstan and Turkey, the government has promoted what they call a parallel import scheme so effectively a lot of products that were blocked in March and April are now starting to reappear, albeit at a higher price.""

"Liam Gallagher fans have been urged to consider their travel options for Sunday's concert in Glasgow due to the fallout from the third rail strike. Services across the country will be disrupted as signal boxes reopen at staggered times after the 24-hour walkout on Saturday. About 50,000 people are expected to attend the ex-Oasis star's Hampden gig. ScotRail is encouraging people to arrive early as reduced hourly services will be running. As a result of thetemporary timetable,,externalwhich has been in place since 5 June, the last train back to the city centre will leave at 20:38. There will also be no trains from Mount Florida or Kings Park after the event finishes. And there will be no trains out of the city centre after the concert ends at 22:30.â¯ Network Rail strike: Scotland likely to see more 24-hour walkouts Network Rail strike: Passengers stay away as nine in 10 trains cancelled Which trains will run in Scotland during the strike? Phil Campbell, ScotRail head of customer operations, said:â¯â¯""We'll be doing what we can to help Liam Gallagher fans travel to Hampden Park on Sunday, but customers should plan ahead as services will be impacted by Saturday's Network Rail RMT strike action, engineering work near Haymarket and Barrhead, and by the temporary timetable we currently have in place. ""Services between Glasgow Central and Mount Florida, and between Glasgow Central and Kings Park are expected to be exceptionally busy due the reduced temporary Sunday timetable, so we're encouraging customers to travel to the stadium early if they can or consider what alternative transport is available."" About 40,000 Network Rail staff have taken part in the strike in a dispute over pay, working conditions and redundancies. ScotRail cancelled 90% of its services on Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday. Cross-border services have also been badly affected. On the days of strike action the operator is only running services on five routes across the country between the hours of 07:30 and 18:30. These routes are: Edinburgh to Glasgow via Falkirk High: two trains per hour Edinburgh to Bathgate: two trains per hour Glasgow to Hamilton/Larkhall: two trains per hour Glasgow to Lanark: two trains per hour Edinburgh to Glasgow via Shotts: one train per hour In a bid to reduce pressure on the limited services ScotRail is advising customers to only travel if they really need to and to consider alternative options where possible. It is believed many people have chosen to work at home on strike days, with Transport Scotland reporting no significant increase in road traffic. First Glasgow said there was a 13% increase on bus passengers in the city on Tuesday compared with the same time last week. Deputy First Minister John Swinney called for ""more urgency"" from UK ministers and the Department for Transport (DfT) to break the deadlock. In response the DfT said it was encouraging the unions and industry to agree a deal to call off the strikes. The RMT said Network Rail's plans to cut 2,500 jobs would put safety at risk and has warned that strikes could continue over the next six months. Network Rail Scotland said it was keen to reach a resolution but stressed any deal that was done had to be fair on both its workers and on the taxpayer.

"This video can not be played Boris Johnson tells Radio 4's Today there will be no ""psychological transformation"" from him. Boris Johnson has said a ""psychological transformation"" in his character is ""not going to happen"" after by-election defeats led to calls for change. The PM was responding to Tory party chairman Oliver Dowden saying it could not be ""business as usual"" as he quit. Mr Johnson told BBC Radio 4's Today programme, he ""humbly and sincerely"" accepts criticism. But he said he also had to distinguish between ""criticism that really matters and criticism that doesn't"". The by-election defeats in Wakefield and Tiverton and Honiton on Friday came after the prime minister faced months of criticism over parties in Downing Street during lockdown, alongside soaring inflation and a narrower-than-expected win in a confidence vote from his own MPs. Speaking from the Commonwealth heads of government meeting in Rwanda, Mr Johnson repeatedly said that policy was more important than allegations about his conduct. Listen: the Boris Johnson interview in full What's the political mood following by-election dramas? Tory rebels consider new bid to oust PM Tory chairman quits after by-election losses Mr Johnson said voters were ""fed up with hearing conversation about me"" and wanted to focus instead on the cost of living, the economy and ""standing up to violence and aggression"" in Ukraine. The PM was challenged by presenter Mishal Husain that a lot of the criticism had been about him personally and had come from people who had worked with him. They included his top policy aide Munira Murza, whocriticised Mr Johnson's ""scurrilous allegation"" about Jimmy Savile and Sir Keir Starmer;former minister Jesse Norman, who said the PM ""presided over a culture of casual law-breaking""; andethics adviser Lord Geidt. But Mr Johnson said: ""As a leader, you have to try to distinguish between the criticism that really matters and the criticism that doesn't."" Asked if there was any matter of principle he would consider resigning over, he said if he had to abandon Ukraine because it became too difficult or the costs were too great, he would quit. He said that ""of course"" he regarded morality as a part of leadership. But Mr Johnson was questioned about how he had not resigned over misleading the House of Commons, breaking the law for the Covid fine, or losing the support of 41% of his MPs in the confidence vote. ""Let's look at this in a more cheery way, if that's possible"" he said. ""Actually, what's happened is that I've got a renewed mandate from my colleagues, and I'm going to continue to deliver."" The prime minister did not engage with a question about the UK's top civil servant Simon Case havingan informal conversation about job opportunities for his wife, Carrie. ""The worst thing I could do is get into conversations about my family,"" he said. This was an interview in which the prime minister repeatedly attempted to detach his character and conduct, from policy. ""You have to try to distinguish between the criticism that really matters and the criticism that doesn't,"" he said. There was an acknowledgement his character isn't going to change. And he sought to turn criticisms of it into policy disagreements - citing, for instance, the one Conservative MP who has advocated the UK re-joining the EU's single market. His problem is many of his Conservative critics think the judgement of big chunks of the electorate, including among Tory voters, is set when it comes to his character. And there is restlessness, too, among some backbenchers on policy as well. He is repeatedly struggling to change the record from one about his own future, and how much of one he has in Downing Street. Speaking to reporters in the Rwandan capital of Kigali later on Saturday, Mr Johnson was asked if he considered the question of his leadership settled and said: ""Yes."" He refused to comment on a report in the Times that he planned to builda Â£150,000 treehouse for his son Wilf in the grounds of Chequers,external, the prime minister's country residence, with possible funding from a Tory donor. ""I'm not going to comment on non-existent objects or non-existent jobs to do with my family,"" he said. Asked in his BBC interview about policies to ease the rising cost of living, Mr Johnson declined to offer a commitment to cut fuel duty further or remove VAT from energy bills. ""There may be more things we can do,"" he said, but he added that ministers are already ""doing a huge amount with the fiscal firepower we have"" and said the public understands the financial situation the government is in. The PM refused to comment on reports he had planned a Â£150,000 treehouse for his son at Chequers Tory backbencher Bob Neill told the BBC the prime minister's response to the by-election defeats was wrong. ""This is a genuine sense of growing frustration and growing alarm that the party is being taken down a track that will lead to it inevitably losing the next election,"" he said. Criticism of Mr Johnson was not just about ""personality"", but whether his ""character and adherence to the rules"" were consistent with standards that Conservative voters in particular expect, Mr Neill said. He said there was also ""evidence of drift and lack of grip on economic issues"", while ""the highest rate of taxation for 40 years"" was not an economic policy Conservatives would recognise. The prime minister's interview comes as two Tory MPs critical of his record say they may stand for election to the committee that runs the party's leadership contests, with one saying he would be in favour ofchanging the rules to allow a second confidence vote. Foreign Secretary Liz Truss, who has joined the PM in Rwanda for the summit of Commonwealth leaders, said people often want to ""send a message"" to government in by-elections and the defeats were not necessarily a predictor of general election failure. ""It hasn't been the predictor in the past and I don't believe it will be the predictor of the next general election,"" she said. Ahead of a meeting of G7 and Nato leaders, she also urged governments to continue to support Ukraine's ""fight for freedom"", saying any concessions to Russia would be ""appalling"". At the summit in Kigali, Mr Johnson also defended his government's policy of trying to deport asylum seekers to the east African nation. Asked by the BBC by how much Channel crossings in small boats needed to be reduced for the policy to be considered a success, he said: ""I'm not going to give you a figure."" He said it was a ""humane policy"" which was about ""breaking the business model of those who criminally abuse and cheat people crossing the Channel in unseaworthy vessels.""

"Boris Johnson has said he is ""actively thinking"" about a third term, amid criticism of his leadership. The prime minister was asked if he would like to serve a full second term in office - to 2028 or 2029. ""At the moment I'm thinking actively about the third term and what could happen then, but I will review that when I get to it,"" he told reporters. One Tory MP has said he wants the rules changed so Mr Johnson could face another confidence vote. Speaking to reporters in Kigali, Rwanda, where he has been at the Commonwealth Heads of Government meeting, the prime minister was asked to elaborate on his comment, replying that he was thinking ""about a third term - mid 2030s"". No 10 later suggested he was joking, but it points to Boris Johnson's bullish mood despite two bruising by-election defeats in the past week in Wakefield, and Tiverton and Honiton. Following the results,party co-chairman Oliver Dowden resigned, saying ""someone must take responsibility"". The Lib Demsoverturned a huge Tory majorityin Tiverton and Honiton - their third by-election victory over Boris Johnson's party in a year. And Labour retook the seat of Wakefield, West Yorkshire, which it lost at the 2019 general election. Former Conservative leader Michael Howardcalled on Mr Johnson to resign following the by-elections, adding ""members of the cabinet should very carefully consider their positions"". What's the political mood after by-election dramas? Six takeaways for Tories from by-election doorsteps PM: I will not undergo psychological transformation Mr Johnson insisted he would lead his party into the next election, and said he wanted to keep driving forward his plan to reduce inequality across the country - what his government calls ""levelling-up"". While acknowledging it would take time, he added that a ""huge amount of progress"" could be made in two parliaments. He told reporters: ""Forget about me, think about what this country, the UK could do and where it's gone. ""We've embarked on a massive project to change the government, the constitution of the country and the way we run our legal system, the way we manage borders, our economy, all sorts of things we're doing differently. ""Also at the same time we are embarked on a colossal project to unite and level up. I happen to believe in that incredibly strongly. ""Levelling-up is a great, great mission and it won't be easily accomplished and people will say it hasn't worked, it's not working yet, people in this constituency aren't feeling the benefits - it's going to take time and I want to keep driving it forward."" But Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer accused the prime minister of ""taking voters for granted with impunity"", saying ""those days are over"". ""They now face a credible Labour Party: a government-in-waiting with a plan to deliver on the country's demands,"" Sir Keir wrote in the Observer. ""For months, Johnson has been privately claiming that he will hold an early election. My message to him is simple: bring it on,"" he added. During his trip to Rwanda to meet Commonwealth leaders, Mr Johnson showed little sign of the pressure he's faced from critics in his own party who've called on him to quit. And Mr Johnson refused to comment on a report in the Times that he planned to builda Â£150,000 treehouse for his son Wilf in the grounds of Chequers,external, the prime minister's country residence, with possible funding from a Tory donor. Mr Johnson has faced renewed criticism from inside his party after losing the safe Tory seat of Tiverton and Honiton to the Liberal Democrats On Saturday he said the question of his leadership was ""settled"" after he won a confidence vote among his own MPs. But Tory backbencher Andrew Bridgen confirmed he wanted the party's rules changed so that Mr Johnson could face another vote of confidence before 12 months are up. Under the current rules, Mr Johnson is technically safe from a challenge until next June. Mr Bridgen told the BBC: ""Boris Johnson is actually galvanising an anti-Boris Johnson vote. ""The leader of the party should normally be more popular than the party itself, but what we're seeing with Johnson is he's a huge drag on the ticket.""

"This video can not be played Watch: Moments that made this by-election historic This is an important mood-making week for our biggest political parties. Encounters with the electorate always mould the mojo of our political leaders. For when you are in the popularity business, the verdict of voters, however geographically piecemeal, can't be ignored. But there can be other catalysts that prompt a smile or a frown, and both the Scottish National Party and Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party each face one of those moments in the coming days too. Six takeaways for Tories from by-election doorsteps Tory chairman quits after by-election losses Starmer hails great result for Labour in Wakefield But let's take a look first at the Conservatives, Labour and the Liberal Democrats. The result in Wakefield in West Yorkshire was less surprising but more important than the one in Devon. Why? Because if Labour are to win a general election they need to take seats, and lots of them, from the Conservatives. The party is pleased that, were themargin of Labour's victory there to be repeated at a general election(a big if, as they acknowledge, as by-elections are not about electing a government), they would have won a majority. They take issue with the election guru Sir John Curtice's analysis. Professor Sir John, of Strathclyde University, said the result implied there was still a question mark about the electorate's enthusiasm for Labour, as opposed to distaste for the Conservatives, given the decline in the Conservative vote was more than twice as big as the rise in the Labour vote. Senior figures point out that plenty assumed when Sir Keir Starmer became Labour leader that such was the electoral mountain the party faced,  he would never himself make it to Downing Street, but instead make it possible for his successor to do so. ""The mantra in the office is we have to be Kinnock and Blair,"" says one source, a reference to Lord Kinnock's rebuilding of the party and Sir Tony's delivery of an election victory. They believe such a victory is now seen as doable. Another source recently described the Starmer project thus far as ""climbing out of the grave"" dug for them by former leader Jeremy Corbyn. Parts one and two of the plan were detoxifying their brand, as they saw it, and portraying the government as inept. They feel they have done both these things. The third stage, which plenty of figures including influential ones in the shadow cabinet are getting impatient to see, is the case for why people should vote Labour. Theinvestigation by Durham Constabulary into alleged Covid law breaking by Sir Keir and his deputy Angela Raynerhas hamstrung that and it won't begin in earnest until - if - they are cleared. Planning is under way for the party conference in the autumn; after last year's focus on internal Labour machinations, this year's will be about their pitch to the country. What, then, of the Liberal Democrats? They, in the words of one, are ""super chipper"" this weekend. Little wonder; a third whopping win against the Conservatives in a by-election a year. Conservatives have been known to privately describe Lib Dems as the 'yellow peril', a backhanded compliment to their by-election savvy, energy and ruthlessness. The coalition years doused their brand in a political poison for many. The antidote of time appears to have washed much of that away. They are still parliamentary tiddlers - 14 MPs out of 650, just 2% of the Commons. Lib Dem leader Ed Davey joined his newest MP Richard Foorde to celebrate his win But they could play an outsized role in the politics of the next few years, injecting fear into the Conservative psyche about their potential capacity to wipe out swathes of Tory MPs. One thing the Lib Dems are irritated by is the grumbles of Conservatives, most notably the Health Secretary Sajid Javid this weekend, about talk of a deal between the Lib Dems and Labour to work together to eject Tory MPs. As Sir John Curtice has said, there appears to be a growing willingness of voters to vote for whichever party locally is best able to beat the Conservatives. Both Labour and the Lib Dems insist there is no deal, there is no pact, it's parties focusing on where they can win. Lib Dem sources also point out they couldn't possibly have won and won so big in three previously rock solid Conservative seats without luring former Tory voters to them, including, especially in Tiverton and Honiton, plenty who voted Leave. Next: the Conservatives. It's 30 years since a party lost two by elections on the same day. The last time it happened, it was the Conservatives again who were on the receiving end of two chunks of the electorate's ire. On 7 November 1991, they lost Kincardine and Deeside to the Liberal Democrats and Langbaurgh in North Yorkshire to Labour. And what happened at the general election six months later? The Conservatives won them both back. The idea that by-elections can be a psephological quirk â and they can be â and exaggerate a party's popularity or otherwise, is what Tories cling to this weekend. Boris Johnson told the BBC a ""psychological transformation"" in his character is ""not going to happen"" But plenty of Boris Johnson's internal critics think the electorate's judgement on the prime minister's character is set and little can change that. His supporters hope his previous bounce-back-ability has at least one more boing in it. Finally, then, to the DUP and the SNP. Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionists are refusing to go into devolved government at Stormont. They say they won't go back into power sharing until the part of the Brexit deal called theNorthern Ireland Protocolis radically altered, removing that sense from many unionists that it was unpicking the stitches that hold the UK together, the overarching fear of their political creed. On Monday, the proposed change in the law that could ditch chunks of the Protocol will be debated in the Commons. Some are outraged at what they see as the government intentionally breaking international law. Ministers insist it won't do that. What we shouldn't expect is rapid movement from the DUP. They feel they've been repeatedly let down by Boris Johnson and they have a mandate to ensure they get the Protocol sorted, as they see it, before returning to Stormont. Second reading of protocol bill set for next week DUP 'in denial' about financial situation in NI Debating the Protocol Bill won't be enough to resolve that impasse. And so to the Scottish National Party. The first thing which always bears repeating is how, 15 years into government at Holyrood, they continue to be the colossus of Scottish politics; everyone else a shrimp in comparison. It doesn't insulate them from problems; their Westminster leader Ian Blackford has faced calls to resign over his party's handling of a sexual harassment complaint. This video can not be played Ian Blackford apologises to victim and says Patrick Grady should ""reflect"" on behaviour Not only has it raised questions about Mr Blackford's judgement in the eyes of his critics, but proven there is at least one mole within his ranks who has recorded and leaked what was meant to be a private meeting. On Tuesday, party leader and Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon will set out how she plans to ""unlock the door to another independence referendum"", as one figure put it to me. Exactly how they do that, with Boris Johnson refusing to countenance one, will be interesting. It'll be a big moment at the core of the SNP's very reason for being - and so itself a mood-maker for them and Scottish politics more broadly.

"This video can not be played Boris Johnson tells Radio 4's Today there will be no ""psychological transformation"" from him. Boris Johnson has said a ""psychological transformation"" in his character is ""not going to happen"" after by-election defeats led to calls for change. The PM was responding to Tory party chairman Oliver Dowden saying it could not be ""business as usual"" as he quit. Mr Johnson told BBC Radio 4's Today programme, he ""humbly and sincerely"" accepts criticism. But he said he also had to distinguish between ""criticism that really matters and criticism that doesn't"". The by-election defeats in Wakefield and Tiverton and Honiton on Friday came after the prime minister faced months of criticism over parties in Downing Street during lockdown, alongside soaring inflation and a narrower-than-expected win in a confidence vote from his own MPs. Speaking from the Commonwealth heads of government meeting in Rwanda, Mr Johnson repeatedly said that policy was more important than allegations about his conduct. Listen: the Boris Johnson interview in full What's the political mood following by-election dramas? Tory rebels consider new bid to oust PM Tory chairman quits after by-election losses Mr Johnson said voters were ""fed up with hearing conversation about me"" and wanted to focus instead on the cost of living, the economy and ""standing up to violence and aggression"" in Ukraine. The PM was challenged by presenter Mishal Husain that a lot of the criticism had been about him personally and had come from people who had worked with him. They included his top policy aide Munira Murza, whocriticised Mr Johnson's ""scurrilous allegation"" about Jimmy Savile and Sir Keir Starmer;former minister Jesse Norman, who said the PM ""presided over a culture of casual law-breaking""; andethics adviser Lord Geidt. But Mr Johnson said: ""As a leader, you have to try to distinguish between the criticism that really matters and the criticism that doesn't."" Asked if there was any matter of principle he would consider resigning over, he said if he had to abandon Ukraine because it became too difficult or the costs were too great, he would quit. He said that ""of course"" he regarded morality as a part of leadership. But Mr Johnson was questioned about how he had not resigned over misleading the House of Commons, breaking the law for the Covid fine, or losing the support of 41% of his MPs in the confidence vote. ""Let's look at this in a more cheery way, if that's possible"" he said. ""Actually, what's happened is that I've got a renewed mandate from my colleagues, and I'm going to continue to deliver."" The prime minister did not engage with a question about the UK's top civil servant Simon Case havingan informal conversation about job opportunities for his wife, Carrie. ""The worst thing I could do is get into conversations about my family,"" he said. This was an interview in which the prime minister repeatedly attempted to detach his character and conduct, from policy. ""You have to try to distinguish between the criticism that really matters and the criticism that doesn't,"" he said. There was an acknowledgement his character isn't going to change. And he sought to turn criticisms of it into policy disagreements - citing, for instance, the one Conservative MP who has advocated the UK re-joining the EU's single market. His problem is many of his Conservative critics think the judgement of big chunks of the electorate, including among Tory voters, is set when it comes to his character. And there is restlessness, too, among some backbenchers on policy as well. He is repeatedly struggling to change the record from one about his own future, and how much of one he has in Downing Street. Speaking to reporters in the Rwandan capital of Kigali later on Saturday, Mr Johnson was asked if he considered the question of his leadership settled and said: ""Yes."" He refused to comment on a report in the Times that he planned to builda Â£150,000 treehouse for his son Wilf in the grounds of Chequers,external, the prime minister's country residence, with possible funding from a Tory donor. ""I'm not going to comment on non-existent objects or non-existent jobs to do with my family,"" he said. Asked in his BBC interview about policies to ease the rising cost of living, Mr Johnson declined to offer a commitment to cut fuel duty further or remove VAT from energy bills. ""There may be more things we can do,"" he said, but he added that ministers are already ""doing a huge amount with the fiscal firepower we have"" and said the public understands the financial situation the government is in. The PM refused to comment on reports he had planned a Â£150,000 treehouse for his son at Chequers Tory backbencher Bob Neill told the BBC the prime minister's response to the by-election defeats was wrong. ""This is a genuine sense of growing frustration and growing alarm that the party is being taken down a track that will lead to it inevitably losing the next election,"" he said. Criticism of Mr Johnson was not just about ""personality"", but whether his ""character and adherence to the rules"" were consistent with standards that Conservative voters in particular expect, Mr Neill said. He said there was also ""evidence of drift and lack of grip on economic issues"", while ""the highest rate of taxation for 40 years"" was not an economic policy Conservatives would recognise. The prime minister's interview comes as two Tory MPs critical of his record say they may stand for election to the committee that runs the party's leadership contests, with one saying he would be in favour ofchanging the rules to allow a second confidence vote. Foreign Secretary Liz Truss, who has joined the PM in Rwanda for the summit of Commonwealth leaders, said people often want to ""send a message"" to government in by-elections and the defeats were not necessarily a predictor of general election failure. ""It hasn't been the predictor in the past and I don't believe it will be the predictor of the next general election,"" she said. Ahead of a meeting of G7 and Nato leaders, she also urged governments to continue to support Ukraine's ""fight for freedom"", saying any concessions to Russia would be ""appalling"". At the summit in Kigali, Mr Johnson also defended his government's policy of trying to deport asylum seekers to the east African nation. Asked by the BBC by how much Channel crossings in small boats needed to be reduced for the policy to be considered a success, he said: ""I'm not going to give you a figure."" He said it was a ""humane policy"" which was about ""breaking the business model of those who criminally abuse and cheat people crossing the Channel in unseaworthy vessels.""

"Boris Johnson has said he is ""actively thinking"" about a third term, amid criticism of his leadership. The prime minister was asked if he would like to serve a full second term in office - to 2028 or 2029. ""At the moment I'm thinking actively about the third term and what could happen then, but I will review that when I get to it,"" he told reporters. One Tory MP has said he wants the rules changed so Mr Johnson could face another confidence vote. Speaking to reporters in Kigali, Rwanda, where he has been at the Commonwealth Heads of Government meeting, the prime minister was asked to elaborate on his comment, replying that he was thinking ""about a third term - mid 2030s"". No 10 later suggested he was joking, but it points to Boris Johnson's bullish mood despite two bruising by-election defeats in the past week in Wakefield, and Tiverton and Honiton. Following the results,party co-chairman Oliver Dowden resigned, saying ""someone must take responsibility"". The Lib Demsoverturned a huge Tory majorityin Tiverton and Honiton - their third by-election victory over Boris Johnson's party in a year. And Labour retook the seat of Wakefield, West Yorkshire, which it lost at the 2019 general election. Former Conservative leader Michael Howardcalled on Mr Johnson to resign following the by-elections, adding ""members of the cabinet should very carefully consider their positions"". What's the political mood after by-election dramas? Six takeaways for Tories from by-election doorsteps PM: I will not undergo psychological transformation Mr Johnson insisted he would lead his party into the next election, and said he wanted to keep driving forward his plan to reduce inequality across the country - what his government calls ""levelling-up"". While acknowledging it would take time, he added that a ""huge amount of progress"" could be made in two parliaments. He told reporters: ""Forget about me, think about what this country, the UK could do and where it's gone. ""We've embarked on a massive project to change the government, the constitution of the country and the way we run our legal system, the way we manage borders, our economy, all sorts of things we're doing differently. ""Also at the same time we are embarked on a colossal project to unite and level up. I happen to believe in that incredibly strongly. ""Levelling-up is a great, great mission and it won't be easily accomplished and people will say it hasn't worked, it's not working yet, people in this constituency aren't feeling the benefits - it's going to take time and I want to keep driving it forward."" But Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer accused the prime minister of ""taking voters for granted with impunity"", saying ""those days are over"". ""They now face a credible Labour Party: a government-in-waiting with a plan to deliver on the country's demands,"" Sir Keir wrote in the Observer. ""For months, Johnson has been privately claiming that he will hold an early election. My message to him is simple: bring it on,"" he added. During his trip to Rwanda to meet Commonwealth leaders, Mr Johnson showed little sign of the pressure he's faced from critics in his own party who've called on him to quit. And Mr Johnson refused to comment on a report in the Times that he planned to builda Â£150,000 treehouse for his son Wilf in the grounds of Chequers,external, the prime minister's country residence, with possible funding from a Tory donor. Mr Johnson has faced renewed criticism from inside his party after losing the safe Tory seat of Tiverton and Honiton to the Liberal Democrats On Saturday he said the question of his leadership was ""settled"" after he won a confidence vote among his own MPs. But Tory backbencher Andrew Bridgen confirmed he wanted the party's rules changed so that Mr Johnson could face another vote of confidence before 12 months are up. Under the current rules, Mr Johnson is technically safe from a challenge until next June. Mr Bridgen told the BBC: ""Boris Johnson is actually galvanising an anti-Boris Johnson vote. ""The leader of the party should normally be more popular than the party itself, but what we're seeing with Johnson is he's a huge drag on the ticket.""

"An unexploded Russian bomb is removed from a block in Kharkiv The Russian war against Ukraine will inevitably dominate the summit of G7 nations in Bavaria. And the leaders of the US, UK, Germany, France, Italy, Canada and Japan face a difficult challenge. They are aiming to put on a show of unity and resolve over the war. In recent months, the Western alliance has shown signs of strain and fatigue. Some voices - particularly in France, Germany and Italy - have asked if it might not be better for the war to end, even if it came at the cost of Ukraine having to cede territory. Arecent cross-Europe opinion poll,externalsuggested some voters put solving the cost-of-living crisis ahead of punishing Russia. Others argue about the need to salvage some kind of relationship with Russia in the future. Countries like the UK, Poland and the three Baltic States have been resisting these arguments, saying that any peace deal with Moscow that is not on Ukraine's terms would lead to further Russian aggression in the future. President Zelensky is likely to reinforce this argument when he addresses the summit virtually on Monday. So the G7 leaders are expected to try to use the summit to clear these muddy waters, promising more weapons to Ukraine and more sanctions against Russia. The idea will be to send a signal to Russian President Vladimir Putin that the West has the strategic patience to maintain its support for Ukraine, even if it faces domestic political pressure at home from voters concerned about rising prices. The problem for G7 leaders is they also face growing pressure to show they are tackling the global economic crisis. The soaring price of fuel and food is causing hunger and unrest across the world. And some countries are pointing the finger at the West. Many countries in the global south do not share Western concerns about Russian aggression. They see the conflict as a European war and seem unmoved by Western arguments that Vladimir Putin is acting as a colonial aggressor. And they blame Western sanctions - as much as Russia's invasion - for the rising costs of gas and oil, and the massive shortage of wheat and fertiliser. WTO boss warns of global food crisis Russia earns $97bn on fuel exports since invasion To try to resist this narrative, G7 countries are expected to use the summit to show they are acting to help countries round the world - with development aid, debt restructuring, climate finance, help finding alternative sources of energy and, of course, fresh efforts to get grain out of Ukraine's ports. That is why Germany has invited the leaders of India, Indonesia, Senegal, Argentina and South Africa to the summit, to hear their perspective and show the rest of the world the G7 is listening. So on the one hand, these Western leaders must show resolve to keep backing Ukraine, and on the other, they must show a readiness to fix the global economic shocks that some blame, in part, on the war.

"US President Joe Biden says ""the Supreme Court has made some terrible decisions"", the day after it ended the constitutional right to abortion Demonstrators are taking to the streets again - crowds have gathered outside the Supreme Court building in Washington DC Dozens of protests are planned around the US over the weekend by pro-choice activists But anti-abortion campaigners have been celebrating after the court reversed its 50-year-old Roe v Wade decision Some states have vowed to become ""safe havens"" for women seeking abortions but about half are likely to introduce new restrictions or bans And 13 have so-called trigger laws in place that will see abortion quickly banned - some clinics have begun shutting down already Edited by Tom Geoghegan Thank you for following the day's events with us. There was a second day of protests across the US in the wake of the historic Supreme Court decision that ended the constitutional right to abortion. US President Joe Biden criticised the court again on Saturday, saying it  ""has made some terrible decisions"". Thirteen states have so-called trigger laws in place that will see abortion quickly banned - some clinics begun shutting down immediately after the ruling. Contributors to the page today were Tom Geoghegan, Holly Honderich, Jessica Murphy, Sam Cabral, James Clarke, Nathan Williams and Robin Levinson-King. Shortly after the Supreme Court decision on Friday, President Biden urged pro-choice Americans to head to the polls and elect politicians who support abortion rights. Democrats will seek to use the abortion issue to energise their base, and for some voters, ensuring Democrats control Congress could take on fresh urgency. Biden is also likely to come under increasing pressure to reform the Supreme Court. Individual states, including Minnesota, Washington, Oregon, and California, and cities like New York, have vowed to offer reproductive care to women living in states where abortion is banned. Campaigners have also been putting in place efforts to ensure women travelling from out-of-state have access to support - and the financial funds - needed to access abortion services. At a state level, new laws restricting abortion are already being challenged. Planned Parenthood in Utah filed a lawsuit on Saturday challenging the constitutionality of the stateâs abortion ban. And earlier this month, a synagogue in Florida sued the state, arguing a law that will ban most abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy as of 1 July, violates religious freedoms. Pro-choice campaigners are also seeking to improve access to abortion medication, especially in states where abortion is heavily restricted. Medication was used in just over 50% of abortions in the US in 2020, according to data from the Guttmacher Institute, which supports abortion rights.   Protesters don Handmaid's Tale costumes to protest about the nomination of conservative Justice Amy Coney Barrett In Margaret Atwood's 1985 novel The Handmaid's Tale - now a hit TV series - she imagined a fictional American dystopia. Writing in The Atlantic, she says the US Supreme Court has brought Gilead to life. ""In the fictional theocracy of Gilead, women had very few rights, as in 17th Century New England. The Bible was cherry-picked, with the cherries being interpreted literally. Although I eventually completed this novel and called it The Handmaidâs Tale, I stopped writing it several times, because I considered it too far-fetched. Silly me. The Alito opinion purports to be based on Americaâs Constitution. But it relies on English jurisprudence from the 17th Century, a time when a belief in witchcraft caused the death of many innocent people. If Justice Alito wants you to be governed by the laws of the 17th Century, you should take a close look at that century. Is that when you want to live?"" Read Atwood's piece here,external Kathleen McClellan from Breaux Bridge, Louisiana, told the BBC she thinks yesterday's ruling is a step forward for America. ""Yesterday I was overjoyed to hear the news that Roe had been overturned. My employer called me as soon as he heard about it and he was extremely grateful also. I went to Mass on my lunch break and the priest was so moved by the Supreme Court decision that he broke into tears during his homily. ""Legislation protecting human life in every stage of development and ability is another humane goal that Americans can now freely enact state by state. My state of Louisiana has chosen to do that and I'm proud of our governor and legislators."" Holly HonderichBBC News, Washington For Mississippi Attorney General Lynn Fitch, this weekend is one of celebration. ""It's a great day for the American people,"" she said. ""Roe v Wade is now behind us."" Fitch can take some personal credit for the ruling. Under her direction, her state asked the Supreme Court to uphold Mississippi's abortion ban and slash Roe v Wade in the process. The case, according to Fitch, was about ""women's empowerment"". Abortion, she said, offered women a false choice - motherhood or career, not both. ""Fifty years ago, for professional women, they wanted you to make a choice. Now you don't have to,"" she said last year. ""You have the option in life to really achieve your dreams, your goals, and you can have those beautiful children as well."" Read more:The woman who helped topple Roe The crowds gathered again on Saturday but not in the same numbers A pro-choice protester outside the court Two demonstrators stand off Protesters take a break from the June heat Planned Parenthood Association of Utah and the American Civil Liberties Union of Utah have filed a lawsuit against a state law banning all abortions. Utah is one of the states that moved to immediately ban abortion after Friday's Supreme Court decision. The lawsuit, filed on Saturday, argues that Utah's abortion ban violates the state's constitution and asks for a restraining order to block it from being enforced. Utah's so-called ""trigger law"" bans abortion in the state, expect in rare cases, including verifiable rape or incest and where the mother's life is at risk or if the pregnancy poses a threat of ""substantial and irreversible impairment of a major bodily functionâ.  Friday's Supreme Court decision was decades in the making, and a major victory for the anti-abortion campaigners in the United States. So after overturning the 50-year-old Roe v Wade - the landmark US ruling that made abortion a constitutional right - what comes next for the movement? Many see overturning Roe v Wade as just the beginning of its work. Some of the battle will now move to the state level, since the ruling means individual states are free to set their own rules. Carol Tobias, President of National Right to Life, has said overturning Roe means campaigners will now move to âencourage as many states as possible to ban abortion to whatever extent they canâ. Others, including the Susan B Anthony List, which supports anti-abortion politicians, have called on increasing efforts to financially support families and new mothers. In the Atlantic,,externalconservative Christian and commentator David French points to policies like Senator Mitt Romneyâs proposed Family Security Act, which would offer monthly financial assistance to expecting mothers and families with children. âThe Romney plan isnât the answer to child poverty and family financial insecurity, but it is an answer, and its concrete financial support for mothers and children would be a tangible statement of our nationâs moral commitment to young families,â he writes.

US footballer Megan Rapinoe has spoken emotionally about the impact the Roe v Wade overturning will have on her, her teammates and others. At a team news conference in Denver, Colorado, Rapinoe, one of the stars of the US women's national team, said she wanted to talk about football, but the anti-abortion ruling took precedence. This video can not be played Roe v Wade: How sad a day this is - Rapinoe Catherine Lewis, 56, from North Carolina, says she thinks that Fridayâs Supreme Court decision was âcorrect from a constitutional perspectiveâ. âI am always for supporting state's rights and this merely puts the decision back into the individual state's hands to decide what's best for their citizens,â she tells the BBC. Lewis says she is opposed to abortion âbecause I am a firm believer in the sanctity of lifeâ. âIn fact, I just wrote my friend's memoir where she explains that she was glad that her parents chose life for her rather than abortion so that she could live."" One part of her message to those who oppose her view would be to âchallenge them to think outside their political talking points and really dive into the issueâ. âLook at it from a legal perspective and understand what Scotus did by sending the decision back to the states,â she says.    JP Morgan, Levi Strauss and Microsoft are among the major US corporations rushing to protect their employees' access to abortion, covering expenses for those who travel for the procedure. Yesterday's ruling - and the abortion bans now expected in at least 13 states - means that millions of US women will have to drive hundreds of miles to get to the nearest clinic. ""We recognise the impact of the ruling and that we remain committed to providing comprehensive access to quality and affordable care for all of our employees, cast members and their families, including family planning and reproductive care, no matter where they live,"" Disney said in a statement. The pro-choice stance taken by so many US companies, including Apple, Tesla, Yelp, Citigroup, Netflix and Lyft, has already generated some backlash from Republican lawmakers, who have threatened to cancel contracts with companies offering support for abortion. In Texas, a state lawmaker has introduced a bill that would prevent companies from doing business with local governments in the state if they provide abortion-related benefits to their employees. Here's a flavour of the demonstrations and celebrations which cascaded across the US in the hours after the highest court in the US reversed the Roe v Wade ruling. More protests have been taking place today, including outside the courthouse in Washington. This video can not be played Protests after US Supreme Court abortion ruling Demonstrators take to the streets after court overturns Roe v Wade ruling. The decision, released on Friday morning, will have repercussions in the US for years to come. With the ruling, the conservative-majority court effectively ended the constitutional right to an abortion. Five justices were in favour: Samuel Alito, Clarence Thomas, Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett. Chief Justice John Roberts wrote a separate opinion saying that he supported an abortion law in Mississippi at the centre of the case but he would not have overturned Roe v Wade. The three other justices disagreed with the majority - Stephen Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kaga. Here are some key passages from the landmark ruling: ""Roe was egregiously wrong from the start. Its reasoning was exceptionally weak, and the decision has had damaging consequences. And far from bringing about a national settlement of the abortion issue, Roe and Casey have enflamed debate and deepened division"" Samuel Alito, writing for the majority, Supreme Court justice ""It is time to heed the Constitution and return the issue of abortion to the peopleâs elected representatives"" Samuel Alito, writing for the majority, Supreme Court justice âThe majority would allow States to ban abortion from conception onward because it does not think forced childbirth at all implicates a womanâs rights to equality and freedom. Todayâs Court, that is, does not think there is anything of constitutional significance attached to a womanâs control of her body and the path of her lifeâ Justices Stephen Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan, in the dissent, Supreme Court justices âWhatever the exact scope of the coming laws, one result of todayâs decision is certain: the curtailment of womenâs rights, and of their status as free and equal citizensâ Justices Stephen Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan, in the dissent, Supreme Court justices Pro-choice protester Guido Reichstadter began climbing the huge Frederick Douglass Memorial Bridge on Friday morning and remains there more than 24 hours later. In a post on Twitter, he said he would rather be anywhere else but he feels strongly for abortion rights.

Minnesota has joined a handful of other US states, including California, Oregon and Washington, in saying it will ensure women can seek abortion there if they face restrictive laws in their homes states. âMy office has been and will continue to be a firewall against legislation that would reverse reproductive freedom,"" said Minnesota Governor Tim Walz in a statement on Saturday.   President Biden will come under increasing pressure from Democrats to reform - especially to expand - the highest court in the US in the wake of Friday's historic abortion decision. Biden launched a commission in April 2021 to explore possible reforms, but it avoided taking a position in its final report on so-called ""court packing"" by adding justices to the current nine on the bench - though it said it there was no legal obstacle in doing so. Adding more justices to the court could shift the ideological balance of the bench, which currently leans conservative. On Saturday, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre threw cold water on the possibility. She told journalists travelling with the president to a G7 meeting in Europe that expanding the court ""is something that the president does not agree with"". ""That is not something that he wants to do."" She said there was ""no final decision"" she could share on any other proposed reforms, which include possible term limits for justices. Nomia IqbalBBC News, Washington Pro-choice activists are surrounding the few people who are anti-abortion here by the courthouse in Washington DC. One man with a sign âJesus Savesâ shouts that he loves everybody as a group of women gather around him shouting âMy body, my choice!â. He eventually moves away after a few minutes of confrontation and chanting at each other. Police are still stood in front of the heavily secured Supreme Court building. If you're just joining us, or would like a refresher on what's been going on today - here are some of the day's main headlines so far on the day after the US Supreme Court overturned the constitutional right to abortion. Biden's criticism continues- President Joe Biden, who yesterday described the ruling as a ""tragic error"", has spoken out again. After signing a landmark gun control bill into law - the first in decades, but which has been overshadowed by the abortion verdict - Biden was asked whether the court is a broken institution, and replied: ""I think the Supreme Court has made some terrible decisions.""  Demonstrations continue- Abortion-rights supporters have been protesting across the US again, with events planned around the nation over the weekend. Crowds have gathered again outside the Supreme Court building in Washington DC - but pro-life activists are there too. Friday's protests were largely peaceful, though police fired tear gas on protesters in Phoenix, Arizona, and police in riot gear moved to disperse a hard core of protesters in downtown Los Angeles. Global reaction continues- As well as protests in the US, there have been demonstrations in major cities around the world, while international leaders such as Canada's Justin Trudeau, French President Emmanual Macron and New Zealand's Jacinda Ardern have voiced their dismay over the ruling. And female US celebrities from a variety of sectors have spoken of their anger or sadness, including singer Bille Eilish, tennis star Coco Gauff and US soccer icon Megan Rapinoe. Actual changes have started- Several states have already moved to make abortion illegal, with new laws immediately imposed in Arkansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Missouri, Oklahoma, South Dakota and Utah. Abortion clinics have been closing and a senator in Oklahoma told the BBC anyone carrying out an abortion there now could face five years in jail. Teenage US tennis star Coco Gauff says she is disappointed by the US Supreme Court's decision, in a pre-Wimbledon news conference. The 18-year-old has previously used her platform to comment on social issues, andwrote ""Peace - end gun violence"" on a camera lensafter she won the semi-final at the French Open last month. ""Obviously I feel bad for future women and women now, but I also feel bad for those who protested for this, I don't even know how many years ago, but protested for this (and) are alive to see that decision to be reversed,"" Reuters quotes Gauff as saying. She tells reporters in London she feels like ""we're almost going backwards"" and says she's concerned it could lead to the reversal of other things people worked hard to achieve in the past. ""I still want to encourage people to use their voice and not feel too discouraged about this because we can definitely make a change, and hopefully change will happen,"" Gauff adds. Anthony ZurcherBBC North America reporter It's been 50 years since the legality of abortion was determined by votes, so the electoral implications of returning this power to the states are difficult to predict. When abortion rights were protected by Supreme Court precedent, public opinion surveys generally indicated that it was conservatives who were more motivated to vote based on the issue. Democrats, with the status quo on their side, were less inclined to make abortion a top issue. But recent polls suggest that calculus may change now that Roe is gone. According to a CBS News survey in May, 40% of Democrats said they would be more likely to vote if Roe v Wade were overturned, compared to only 17% of Republicans. If Democrats are able to use the abortion issue to energise their base, it could give their hopes of electoral success new life despite a president struggling with low popularity and a challenging economic climate. Control of the US Congress, which could pass legislation protecting or banning abortion nationally, is also up for grabs. Democrats have a slim majority in the House of Representatives and are tied 50-50 in the US Senate, maintaining control only through Vice-President Kamala Harris' tie-breaking vote. Even the slightest shifts in electoral winds in the months before November's votes could have dramatic implications for abortion rights across the US. Â© 2025 BBC.

Aspecial timetable,externalhas been published and Network Rail has said passengers should travel by train only if necessary. Rail companies have also warned passengers that journeys on Sunday and even Monday could be affected by the walkout. The expected knock-on disruption is because of too few staff working overnight and morning shifts not clocking on until after the usual morning timetable has begun. On the south Wales to London mainline, there are just nine trains running in each direction, but trains are operating only from Cardiff Central. Stations between the Welsh capital and Swansea have no services. GWR's south Wales mainline service to London will only run to and from Cardiff on strike days rather than Swansea Those directGWR services between London Paddington and Cardiff,externalwill be one an hour, not the usual two, with the first service leaving each terminus later than normal. A service between Cardiff and Westbury in Wiltshire - linking south Wales with Bristol and Bath - also ran a reduced service.

TfW has warned passengers that services that are running are expected to be ""very busy"" while GWR said people faced ""severe disruption"" and asked them ""to only travel by rail if absolutely necessary."" Across the UK, four out of five trains will not run during the strikes, with 4,500 services operating compared to the usual 20,000. Rail workers, such as maintenance staff, signallers and operations teams, are in dispute. As well as Saturday's rail strikes, theM48 Severn Bridge is shut from Fridayat 19:00 until Monday at 06:00 for essential maintenance work to start inspecting the bridge's suspension cables. The M48 Severn Bridge will be shut until Monday morning due to prepare for essential maintenance work The strike and bridge closure means Angie Ruston has to leave for work more than two hours before she clocks on. The 58-year-old, who works at an artificial intelligence project in Bristol, has to be at her nearest bus stop in Chepstow for just after 07:45 to get into work for 10:00. Angie Ruston's commute to work from Chepstow to Bristol is more than twice as long on Saturday ""It's a nightmare, a perfect storm for me,"" she said. ""I'd have thought whoever runs the bridge would have known there is a rail strike on, anticipate the possible excess traffic and put the closure off. ""It seems stupid to do it at the same time as the rail strike, there's no forward thinking. ""My journey to work normally takes me less than 50 minutes, it'll take me two hours on Saturday. It's not ideal so while I'm working between 10am and 3pm, I'll be out the house between half seven and 5pm. ""But on Sunday it's worse because there will be no buses or trains that get me into work by 10:00 so unfortunately I'll be late."" Ilsehar Hopcroft has said she has cancelled a family get-together on Saturday because of travel disruption The double disruptions are not just affecting people's work but family plans too as Ilsehar Hopcroft has cancelled a family get-together. ""I had families coming from Norfolk and mum was going to come from Cardiff, but we've had to put that off,"" said the 23-year-old mum-of-one from Chepstow. ""It's quite frustrating as Saturday was quite important because of distance and Covid lately, we don't see them very often. It is having a huge impact on people."" Chelsea Hopkins said it took her almost seven hours to get home from work on Wednesday evening after her commute was affected when alorry fire closed the M4 Severn Bridge. Now the marketing manager, who lives 10 miles from Chepstow on the Welsh side of the bridge, said she was doing more logistics planning to meet a colleague at her work in Bristol to travel together to an event in Coventry. ""The bridge closures always seem to be incredibly inconvenient at the height of tourist season, during commute times or on school holidays,"" said the 30-year-old. Chelsea Hopkins says although the disruption is frustrating ""it has to happen"" ""I certainly support the rail strikers and rail is usually my backup plan. The traffic network around the bridges is pretty fragile, like the lorry fire on the M4 on Wednesday which caused tailbacks. ""It'll be frustrating but it has to happen, perhaps we can all have a weekend at home enjoying the area we live in - apart from those working"". National Highways said it was ""not anticipating a significant impact"" from the M48 Severn Bridge closure - especially with M4 Severn Bridge remaining open - after data showed a 4% rise in traffic on the first day of the rail strike on Tuesday. A usual five-mile, 10 minute trip between Chepstow to Aust will be 31 miles and take about 40 minutes on the weekend due to the M48 Severn Bridge closure ""We understand this work may cause some inconvenience and disruption, but we are making every effort to ensure the impact on drivers is kept to a minimum,"" said Chris Pope of National Highways. ""These pre-planned inspections are vital to allow us to understand the current condition of the suspension cables."" Roads in Wales and Scotland especially are expected to be busier as most railway lines in both nations are shut during the biggest rail walkout for more than 30 years. Motorists are warned to expect Wales' busiest routes to be congested on rail strike days The AA predicted a surge in traffic as train passengers switch to road transport with the worst affected roads likely to be main motorway arteries. The RMT union has said members working for train companies have been subjected to ""pay freezes, threats to jobs and attacks on their terms and conditions"". How much are rail workers paid? Huge rail strike will cause 'misery for millions' Rail dispute still resolvable, says industry boss Network Rail plans to cut 2,500 maintenance jobs as it tries to make Â£2bn of savings over the next two years. The RMT said the jobs were safety critical and cutting them will make accidents more likely, so 40,000 rail workers have walked out over three days this week Network Rail said it would not consider any changes that would make the railways less safe and that modernisation was needed. Most of Transport for Wales services are suspended on Saturday due to the rail strike RMT members are striking and they include people working for Network Rail, which maintains the railways throughout Britain, including Wales. However, TfW - now owned by the Welsh government - is not in dispute with the unions although it has warned of disruption because its trains use railways run by Network Rail. Welsh Education Minister Jeremy Miles said the Labour Welsh government was ""obviously pleased"" staff at TfW were not striking. Transport for Wales is owned by the Labour-run Welsh Government, which is more union friendly ""Clearly the strikes elsewhere will have a significant disruptive impact in Wales and we are asking the UK government to do everything to avoid that disruption,"" Mr Miles toldBBC Politics Wales. ""When people are put in the position that the UK government have, people don't have many options. Nobody wants to see strikes, not even the unions, but the UK government needs to now step up."" But ConservativeMember of the Senedd(MS) Tom Giffard said the unions were ""stuck in the past"" so it was ""really unfortunate these strikes are going ahead."" ""Network Rail and the [UK government's] Department for Transport had said that negotiations had barely started before the unions started balloting to strike... and the timing of this strike was just to maximise disruption as best it could,"" added the South Wales West MS. The Rail Delivery Group, which represents train operators, said: ""If we cannot provide a service for customers due to strike action then we will refund customers."" It has not decided whether customers worried about disruption could cancel trips in advance and get refunds. The National Rail website suggests,externalthere may be options such as switching to a different operator or travelling on another date. But it said customers would not be compensated for things such as hotel stays. Season ticket holders will be able to apply for a refund for the days affected.

There was a second day of protests across the US in the wake of the historic Supreme Court decision that ended the constitutional right to abortion. US President Joe Biden criticised the court again on Saturday, saying it  ""has made some terrible decisions"". Thirteen states have so-called trigger laws in place that will see abortion quickly banned - some clinics begun shutting down immediately after the ruling. Contributors to the page today were Tom Geoghegan, Holly Honderich, Jessica Murphy, Sam Cabral, James Clarke, Nathan Williams and Robin Levinson-King. Shortly after the Supreme Court decision on Friday, President Biden urged pro-choice Americans to head to the polls and elect politicians who support abortion rights. Democrats will seek to use the abortion issue to energise their base, and for some voters, ensuring Democrats control Congress could take on fresh urgency. Biden is also likely to come under increasing pressure to reform the Supreme Court. Individual states, including Minnesota, Washington, Oregon, and California, and cities like New York, have vowed to offer reproductive care to women living in states where abortion is banned. Campaigners have also been putting in place efforts to ensure women travelling from out-of-state have access to support - and the financial funds - needed to access abortion services. At a state level, new laws restricting abortion are already being challenged. Planned Parenthood in Utah filed a lawsuit on Saturday challenging the constitutionality of the stateâs abortion ban. And earlier this month, a synagogue in Florida sued the state, arguing a law that will ban most abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy as of 1 July, violates religious freedoms. Pro-choice campaigners are also seeking to improve access to abortion medication, especially in states where abortion is heavily restricted. Medication was used in just over 50% of abortions in the US in 2020, according to data from the Guttmacher Institute, which supports abortion rights.   Protesters don Handmaid's Tale costumes to protest about the nomination of conservative Justice Amy Coney Barrett In Margaret Atwood's 1985 novel The Handmaid's Tale - now a hit TV series - she imagined a fictional American dystopia. Writing in The Atlantic, she says the US Supreme Court has brought Gilead to life. ""In the fictional theocracy of Gilead, women had very few rights, as in 17th Century New England. The Bible was cherry-picked, with the cherries being interpreted literally. Although I eventually completed this novel and called it The Handmaidâs Tale, I stopped writing it several times, because I considered it too far-fetched. Silly me. The Alito opinion purports to be based on Americaâs Constitution. But it relies on English jurisprudence from the 17th Century, a time when a belief in witchcraft caused the death of many innocent people. If Justice Alito wants you to be governed by the laws of the 17th Century, you should take a close look at that century. Is that when you want to live?"" Read Atwood's piece here,external Kathleen McClellan from Breaux Bridge, Louisiana, told the BBC she thinks yesterday's ruling is a step forward for America. ""Yesterday I was overjoyed to hear the news that Roe had been overturned. My employer called me as soon as he heard about it and he was extremely grateful also. I went to Mass on my lunch break and the priest was so moved by the Supreme Court decision that he broke into tears during his homily. ""Legislation protecting human life in every stage of development and ability is another humane goal that Americans can now freely enact state by state. My state of Louisiana has chosen to do that and I'm proud of our governor and legislators."" Holly HonderichBBC News, Washington For Mississippi Attorney General Lynn Fitch, this weekend is one of celebration. ""It's a great day for the American people,"" she said. ""Roe v Wade is now behind us."" Fitch can take some personal credit for the ruling. Under her direction, her state asked the Supreme Court to uphold Mississippi's abortion ban and slash Roe v Wade in the process. The case, according to Fitch, was about ""women's empowerment"". Abortion, she said, offered women a false choice - motherhood or career, not both. ""Fifty years ago, for professional women, they wanted you to make a choice. Now you don't have to,"" she said last year. ""You have the option in life to really achieve your dreams, your goals, and you can have those beautiful children as well.""

Utah is one of the states that moved to immediately ban abortion after Friday's Supreme Court decision. The lawsuit, filed on Saturday, argues that Utah's abortion ban violates the state's constitution and asks for a restraining order to block it from being enforced. Utah's so-called ""trigger law"" bans abortion in the state, expect in rare cases, including verifiable rape or incest and where the mother's life is at risk or if the pregnancy poses a threat of ""substantial and irreversible impairment of a major bodily functionâ.  Friday's Supreme Court decision was decades in the making, and a major victory for the anti-abortion campaigners in the United States. So after overturning the 50-year-old Roe v Wade - the landmark US ruling that made abortion a constitutional right - what comes next for the movement? Many see overturning Roe v Wade as just the beginning of its work. Some of the battle will now move to the state level, since the ruling means individual states are free to set their own rules. Carol Tobias, President of National Right to Life, has said overturning Roe means campaigners will now move to âencourage as many states as possible to ban abortion to whatever extent they canâ. Others, including the Susan B Anthony List, which supports anti-abortion politicians, have called on increasing efforts to financially support families and new mothers. In the Atlantic,,externalconservative Christian and commentator David French points to policies like Senator Mitt Romneyâs proposed Family Security Act, which would offer monthly financial assistance to expecting mothers and families with children. âThe Romney plan isnât the answer to child poverty and family financial insecurity, but it is an answer, and its concrete financial support for mothers and children would be a tangible statement of our nationâs moral commitment to young families,â he writes.

US footballer Megan Rapinoe has spoken emotionally about the impact the Roe v Wade overturning will have on her, her teammates and others. At a team news conference in Denver, Colorado, Rapinoe, one of the stars of the US women's national team, said she wanted to talk about football, but the anti-abortion ruling took precedence. This video can not be played Roe v Wade: How sad a day this is - Rapinoe Catherine Lewis, 56, from North Carolina, says she thinks that Fridayâs Supreme Court decision was âcorrect from a constitutional perspectiveâ. âI am always for supporting state's rights and this merely puts the decision back into the individual state's hands to decide what's best for their citizens,â she tells the BBC. Lewis says she is opposed to abortion âbecause I am a firm believer in the sanctity of lifeâ. âIn fact, I just wrote my friend's memoir where she explains that she was glad that her parents chose life for her rather than abortion so that she could live."" One part of her message to those who oppose her view would be to âchallenge them to think outside their political talking points and really dive into the issueâ. âLook at it from a legal perspective and understand what Scotus did by sending the decision back to the states,â she says.    JP Morgan, Levi Strauss and Microsoft are among the major US corporations rushing to protect their employees' access to abortion, covering expenses for those who travel for the procedure. Yesterday's ruling - and the abortion bans now expected in at least 13 states - means that millions of US women will have to drive hundreds of miles to get to the nearest clinic. ""We recognise the impact of the ruling and that we remain committed to providing comprehensive access to quality and affordable care for all of our employees, cast members and their families, including family planning and reproductive care, no matter where they live,"" Disney said in a statement. The pro-choice stance taken by so many US companies, including Apple, Tesla, Yelp, Citigroup, Netflix and Lyft, has already generated some backlash from Republican lawmakers, who have threatened to cancel contracts with companies offering support for abortion. In Texas, a state lawmaker has introduced a bill that would prevent companies from doing business with local governments in the state if they provide abortion-related benefits to their employees. Here's a flavour of the demonstrations and celebrations which cascaded across the US in the hours after the highest court in the US reversed the Roe v Wade ruling. More protests have been taking place today, including outside the courthouse in Washington. This video can not be played Protests after US Supreme Court abortion ruling Demonstrators take to the streets after court overturns Roe v Wade ruling. The decision, released on Friday morning, will have repercussions in the US for years to come. With the ruling, the conservative-majority court effectively ended the constitutional right to an abortion. Five justices were in favour: Samuel Alito, Clarence Thomas, Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett. Chief Justice John Roberts wrote a separate opinion saying that he supported an abortion law in Mississippi at the centre of the case but he would not have overturned Roe v Wade. The three other justices disagreed with the majority - Stephen Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kaga. Here are some key passages from the landmark ruling: ""Roe was egregiously wrong from the start. Its reasoning was exceptionally weak, and the decision has had damaging consequences. And far from bringing about a national settlement of the abortion issue, Roe and Casey have enflamed debate and deepened division"" Samuel Alito, writing for the majority, Supreme Court justice ""It is time to heed the Constitution and return the issue of abortion to the peopleâs elected representatives"" Samuel Alito, writing for the majority, Supreme Court justice âThe majority would allow States to ban abortion from conception onward because it does not think forced childbirth at all implicates a womanâs rights to equality and freedom. Todayâs Court, that is, does not think there is anything of constitutional significance attached to a womanâs control of her body and the path of her lifeâ Justices Stephen Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan, in the dissent, Supreme Court justices âWhatever the exact scope of the coming laws, one result of todayâs decision is certain: the curtailment of womenâs rights, and of their status as free and equal citizensâ Justices Stephen Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan, in the dissent, Supreme Court justices Pro-choice protester Guido Reichstadter began climbing the huge Frederick Douglass Memorial Bridge on Friday morning and remains there more than 24 hours later. In a post on Twitter, he said he would rather be anywhere else but he feels strongly for abortion rights.

Minnesota has joined a handful of other US states, including California, Oregon and Washington, in saying it will ensure women can seek abortion there if they face restrictive laws in their homes states. âMy office has been and will continue to be a firewall against legislation that would reverse reproductive freedom,"" said Minnesota Governor Tim Walz in a statement on Saturday.   President Biden will come under increasing pressure from Democrats to reform - especially to expand - the highest court in the US in the wake of Friday's historic abortion decision. Biden launched a commission in April 2021 to explore possible reforms, but it avoided taking a position in its final report on so-called ""court packing"" by adding justices to the current nine on the bench - though it said it there was no legal obstacle in doing so. Adding more justices to the court could shift the ideological balance of the bench, which currently leans conservative. On Saturday, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre threw cold water on the possibility. She told journalists travelling with the president to a G7 meeting in Europe that expanding the court ""is something that the president does not agree with"". ""That is not something that he wants to do."" She said there was ""no final decision"" she could share on any other proposed reforms, which include possible term limits for justices. Nomia IqbalBBC News, Washington Pro-choice activists are surrounding the few people who are anti-abortion here by the courthouse in Washington DC. One man with a sign âJesus Savesâ shouts that he loves everybody as a group of women gather around him shouting âMy body, my choice!â. He eventually moves away after a few minutes of confrontation and chanting at each other. Police are still stood in front of the heavily secured Supreme Court building. If you're just joining us, or would like a refresher on what's been going on today - here are some of the day's main headlines so far on the day after the US Supreme Court overturned the constitutional right to abortion. Biden's criticism continues- President Joe Biden, who yesterday described the ruling as a ""tragic error"", has spoken out again. After signing a landmark gun control bill into law - the first in decades, but which has been overshadowed by the abortion verdict - Biden was asked whether the court is a broken institution, and replied: ""I think the Supreme Court has made some terrible decisions.""  Demonstrations continue- Abortion-rights supporters have been protesting across the US again, with events planned around the nation over the weekend. Crowds have gathered again outside the Supreme Court building in Washington DC - but pro-life activists are there too. Friday's protests were largely peaceful, though police fired tear gas on protesters in Phoenix, Arizona, and police in riot gear moved to disperse a hard core of protesters in downtown Los Angeles. Global reaction continues- As well as protests in the US, there have been demonstrations in major cities around the world, while international leaders such as Canada's Justin Trudeau, French President Emmanual Macron and New Zealand's Jacinda Ardern have voiced their dismay over the ruling. And female US celebrities from a variety of sectors have spoken of their anger or sadness, including singer Bille Eilish, tennis star Coco Gauff and US soccer icon Megan Rapinoe. Actual changes have started- Several states have already moved to make abortion illegal, with new laws immediately imposed in Arkansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Missouri, Oklahoma, South Dakota and Utah. Abortion clinics have been closing and a senator in Oklahoma told the BBC anyone carrying out an abortion there now could face five years in jail. Teenage US tennis star Coco Gauff says she is disappointed by the US Supreme Court's decision, in a pre-Wimbledon news conference. The 18-year-old has previously used her platform to comment on social issues, andwrote ""Peace - end gun violence"" on a camera lensafter she won the semi-final at the French Open last month. ""Obviously I feel bad for future women and women now, but I also feel bad for those who protested for this, I don't even know how many years ago, but protested for this (and) are alive to see that decision to be reversed,"" Reuters quotes Gauff as saying. She tells reporters in London she feels like ""we're almost going backwards"" and says she's concerned it could lead to the reversal of other things people worked hard to achieve in the past. ""I still want to encourage people to use their voice and not feel too discouraged about this because we can definitely make a change, and hopefully change will happen,"" Gauff adds. Anthony ZurcherBBC North America reporter It's been 50 years since the legality of abortion was determined by votes, so the electoral implications of returning this power to the states are difficult to predict. When abortion rights were protected by Supreme Court precedent, public opinion surveys generally indicated that it was conservatives who were more motivated to vote based on the issue. Democrats, with the status quo on their side, were less inclined to make abortion a top issue. But recent polls suggest that calculus may change now that Roe is gone. According to a CBS News survey in May, 40% of Democrats said they would be more likely to vote if Roe v Wade were overturned, compared to only 17% of Republicans. If Democrats are able to use the abortion issue to energise their base, it could give their hopes of electoral success new life despite a president struggling with low popularity and a challenging economic climate. Control of the US Congress, which could pass legislation protecting or banning abortion nationally, is also up for grabs. Democrats have a slim majority in the House of Representatives and are tied 50-50 in the US Senate, maintaining control only through Vice-President Kamala Harris' tie-breaking vote. Even the slightest shifts in electoral winds in the months before November's votes could have dramatic implications for abortion rights across the US. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Patrick says he has been 'part of Cardiff history' It might be time to shed a little tear as a familiar French face on the streets of Cardiff is saying au revoir. French onion seller Patrick Mevel, 64, moved to the Welsh capital in 1979 when he was 21. Patrick - known as one of the Johnny Onions - sold from a traditional bike all over Wales in markets, butchers, and the Hayes in the city centre. After lifting more than 20,000 tonnes of onions over the past 43 years, he has decided to call it a day. Patrick, from Roscoff in Brittany, never set out to become a French onion seller but as a student he asked himself: ""What can I do for my country?"" Ham made in Wales gets protected status The town looking to make a fresh start How do you make French onion soup? He decided to qualify as an officer in the French army but it was not for him so he turned to academic studies and a degree in geography. He arrived on these shores in the summer of 1979 after asking his grandfather to join him selling French onions in the UK. A Johnny Onions from Roscoff in Devon in 1948 French onion sellers - better known as Johnny Onions - originated in Roscoff in the early 20th Century. They sold the pink onions named after that area. The Roscoff onion can be used as a vegetable, side dish or as a condiment, raw or cooked and are well-known for their colour. Johnny Onions are well remembered on the streets of Cardiff and could be found pushing a bicycle covered in strings of onions, and wearing a beret. Patrick reckons once you have a pink French onion, you will not want to try anything else. ""As soon as the onions were here they became the boss of the house"" Patrick's grandfather sold French onions from Roscoff with his brother when he was in his 20s before pursuing a career in the military. He retired in the 1970s but then decided to go back to selling onions and decided at the end of the decade that he would help Patrick. Selling onions is done between August and February and is very intense, involving long hours, starting early in the morning until 11pm. ""As soon as the onions were here they became the boss of the house,"" says Patrick. ""As long as there is an onion in the house you are stringing and selling them all day every day. ""But being away from my world and family in France was a sacrifice, so being over here for my job wasn't for leisure, it was for a living."" His house was not only his home, it also housed all the onions downstairs along with the strings, packing tables and scales. Patrick's bike has been a familiar sight around Cardiff Patrick would have five or six boys come over from France each year to help him and would put them up at his home and make sure they had a home-cooked meal every night. ""Some did 10 seasons with me, others did an hour and went straight back on the ferry! ""My grandfather used to always say when we got to customs we only had hard work, tiredness and dust to declare."" Patrick sold on the Hayes in Cardiff until 2009 but after business started to slow down, he started delivering to markets, butchers and going door-to-door to regular customers. Patrick delivering his last ever bag of Roscoff Pink Onions ""Rain or shine - I remember being there on 18 December 1982 on a Saturday which was one of the coldest days in British history at -27C. The onions froze but we still had to sell them."" Patrick had customers all over Wales and has knocked on thousands of doors across Cardiff. ""It's more than a French onion seller. I'm a regular in their lives and you build a bond. I have seen some customers have babies, go to university and then have babies themselves and I will miss them."" Patrick has decided it is time to retire and move back to France to be with his family. Each bag of onions weighs 55lbs (25kg) and it has taken a toll on his body. Patrick adds: ""Now the page has to be turned, as simple as that. Nobody is there forever.""

"The rally, organised by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions- Northern Ireland Commission (NIC-ICTU), involved 24 trade unions A number of trade unions took part in a cost-of-living demonstration at Stormont on Saturday. The rally, organised by the Northern Ireland committee of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions (ICTU), involved 24 trade unions. It comes after industrial action was proposed bymembers of the Unite union last month over pay. ICTU secretary Owen Reidy said people were ""fed up"" with the inaction of Stormont and Westminster. ""We have a government in Westminster that clearly puts parties before people and we have no government, no executive, here in Northern Ireland,"" he said. ICTU secretary Owen Reidy said this is part of a six-month campaign ""We really believe now is the time for action, in the summer months before we get to the winter, because obviously inflation is at 9%, it is going to go double digits soon."" Mr Reidy said this was part of a six-month campaign to ""bring together, workers, trade union members, community groups and others to demand action on the cost-of-living crisis"". Why are prices rising so quickly? Inflation in the UK, the rate which prices are rising, hit 9.1% last week -the fastest rise for 40 years. People are dealing with higher costs of food as well as spiralling fuel and energy prices, with workers and unions pushing for pay rises to cope with higher prices. Staff nurse Nicola Murphy says the crisis has led to her having to make ""hard choices"" Nicola Murphy, a staff nurse from Newtownards, said she was at the rally because she had ""nowhere else to go"". A single parent who also works full time, Ms Murphy said she has had to make hard choices. ""I chose between me going to work or my son's education because I can't afford the bus fare to get him to school,"" she said. ""I need to rationalise putting that into my car for petrol to be able to go to work. I go to work, my son does not attend school every day."" Ms Murphy has spoken with the school but said ""there is no help, there is no support, there is no guidance"". ""I constantly worry about money, I constantly worry about how to put food on the table especially coming to the end of the month and closer to pay day"", she said. ""It is a highly stressful situation for everybody."" Registered nurse Briege McLaughlin says she feels under valued by MLA's Meanwhile, Briege McLaughlin, a registered nurse at the Mater Hospital, said she has no idea how she is going to continue paying her bills. ""I came here today to tell our MLAs (assembly members) to step up during this cost-of-living crisis and go back to work and sort out their problems,"" she said. ""Step up just like the nurses stepped up during the Covid crisis, we went over and above what was asked of us."" Ms McLaughlin said she has applied to have meters for gas and electricity put in her home and has found herself searching for ""cheaper options"" when food shopping. ""As an educated and highly-skilled nurse, it makes me feel like I am not valued and the people who I work with aren't valued by our MLAs,"" she added. There has been a lot of high-profile industrial action in the past few months, which Mr Reidy believes will continue. ""Workers have to defend their pay and terms and conditions of employment. What are workers to do in the absence of meaningful action in the cost-of-living crisis,"" he said. Mr Reidy said the ICTU wants to see more funds given to devolved governments in order to target low and middle-income earners. The group also wants to see a return of an executive in order to pass legislation to help workers negotiating with their employers and help those most in need. The DUP - which won the second-largest number of Northern Ireland Assembly seats in May's election - arerefusing to nominate ministers or support an assembly speakeruntil its concerns over theNorthern Ireland Protocol, which manages Northern Ireland's post-Brexit trading arrangements, are addressed.

There was a second day of protests across the US in the wake of the historic Supreme Court decision that ended the constitutional right to abortion. US President Joe Biden criticised the court again on Saturday, saying it  ""has made some terrible decisions"". Thirteen states have so-called trigger laws in place that will see abortion quickly banned - some clinics begun shutting down immediately after the ruling. Contributors to the page today were Tom Geoghegan, Holly Honderich, Jessica Murphy, Sam Cabral, James Clarke, Nathan Williams and Robin Levinson-King. Shortly after the Supreme Court decision on Friday, President Biden urged pro-choice Americans to head to the polls and elect politicians who support abortion rights. Democrats will seek to use the abortion issue to energise their base, and for some voters, ensuring Democrats control Congress could take on fresh urgency. Biden is also likely to come under increasing pressure to reform the Supreme Court. Individual states, including Minnesota, Washington, Oregon, and California, and cities like New York, have vowed to offer reproductive care to women living in states where abortion is banned. Campaigners have also been putting in place efforts to ensure women travelling from out-of-state have access to support - and the financial funds - needed to access abortion services. At a state level, new laws restricting abortion are already being challenged. Planned Parenthood in Utah filed a lawsuit on Saturday challenging the constitutionality of the stateâs abortion ban. And earlier this month, a synagogue in Florida sued the state, arguing a law that will ban most abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy as of 1 July, violates religious freedoms. Pro-choice campaigners are also seeking to improve access to abortion medication, especially in states where abortion is heavily restricted. Medication was used in just over 50% of abortions in the US in 2020, according to data from the Guttmacher Institute, which supports abortion rights.   Protesters don Handmaid's Tale costumes to protest about the nomination of conservative Justice Amy Coney Barrett In Margaret Atwood's 1985 novel The Handmaid's Tale - now a hit TV series - she imagined a fictional American dystopia. Writing in The Atlantic, she says the US Supreme Court has brought Gilead to life. ""In the fictional theocracy of Gilead, women had very few rights, as in 17th Century New England. The Bible was cherry-picked, with the cherries being interpreted literally. Although I eventually completed this novel and called it The Handmaidâs Tale, I stopped writing it several times, because I considered it too far-fetched. Silly me. The Alito opinion purports to be based on Americaâs Constitution. But it relies on English jurisprudence from the 17th Century, a time when a belief in witchcraft caused the death of many innocent people. If Justice Alito wants you to be governed by the laws of the 17th Century, you should take a close look at that century. Is that when you want to live?"" Read Atwood's piece here,external Kathleen McClellan from Breaux Bridge, Louisiana, told the BBC she thinks yesterday's ruling is a step forward for America. ""Yesterday I was overjoyed to hear the news that Roe had been overturned. My employer called me as soon as he heard about it and he was extremely grateful also. I went to Mass on my lunch break and the priest was so moved by the Supreme Court decision that he broke into tears during his homily. ""Legislation protecting human life in every stage of development and ability is another humane goal that Americans can now freely enact state by state. My state of Louisiana has chosen to do that and I'm proud of our governor and legislators."" Holly HonderichBBC News, Washington For Mississippi Attorney General Lynn Fitch, this weekend is one of celebration. ""It's a great day for the American people,"" she said. ""Roe v Wade is now behind us."" Fitch can take some personal credit for the ruling. Under her direction, her state asked the Supreme Court to uphold Mississippi's abortion ban and slash Roe v Wade in the process. The case, according to Fitch, was about ""women's empowerment"". Abortion, she said, offered women a false choice - motherhood or career, not both. ""Fifty years ago, for professional women, they wanted you to make a choice. Now you don't have to,"" she said last year. ""You have the option in life to really achieve your dreams, your goals, and you can have those beautiful children as well."" Read more:The woman who helped topple Roe The crowds gathered again on Saturday but not in the same numbers A pro-choice protester outside the court Two demonstrators stand off Protesters take a break from the June heat Planned Parenthood Association of Utah and the American Civil Liberties Union of Utah have filed a lawsuit against a state law banning all abortions. Utah is one of the states that moved to immediately ban abortion after Friday's Supreme Court decision. The lawsuit, filed on Saturday, argues that Utah's abortion ban violates the state's constitution and asks for a restraining order to block it from being enforced. Utah's so-called ""trigger law"" bans abortion in the state, expect in rare cases, including verifiable rape or incest and where the mother's life is at risk or if the pregnancy poses a threat of ""substantial and irreversible impairment of a major bodily functionâ.  Friday's Supreme Court decision was decades in the making, and a major victory for the anti-abortion campaigners in the United States. So after overturning the 50-year-old Roe v Wade - the landmark US ruling that made abortion a constitutional right - what comes next for the movement? Many see overturning Roe v Wade as just the beginning of its work. Some of the battle will now move to the state level, since the ruling means individual states are free to set their own rules. Carol Tobias, President of National Right to Life, has said overturning Roe means campaigners will now move to âencourage as many states as possible to ban abortion to whatever extent they canâ. Others, including the Susan B Anthony List, which supports anti-abortion politicians, have called on increasing efforts to financially support families and new mothers. In the Atlantic,,externalconservative Christian and commentator David French points to policies like Senator Mitt Romneyâs proposed Family Security Act, which would offer monthly financial assistance to expecting mothers and families with children. âThe Romney plan isnât the answer to child poverty and family financial insecurity, but it is an answer, and its concrete financial support for mothers and children would be a tangible statement of our nationâs moral commitment to young families,â he writes.

US footballer Megan Rapinoe has spoken emotionally about the impact the Roe v Wade overturning will have on her, her teammates and others. At a team news conference in Denver, Colorado, Rapinoe, one of the stars of the US women's national team, said she wanted to talk about football, but the anti-abortion ruling took precedence. This video can not be played Roe v Wade: How sad a day this is - Rapinoe Catherine Lewis, 56, from North Carolina, says she thinks that Fridayâs Supreme Court decision was âcorrect from a constitutional perspectiveâ. âI am always for supporting state's rights and this merely puts the decision back into the individual state's hands to decide what's best for their citizens,â she tells the BBC. Lewis says she is opposed to abortion âbecause I am a firm believer in the sanctity of lifeâ. âIn fact, I just wrote my friend's memoir where she explains that she was glad that her parents chose life for her rather than abortion so that she could live."" One part of her message to those who oppose her view would be to âchallenge them to think outside their political talking points and really dive into the issueâ. âLook at it from a legal perspective and understand what Scotus did by sending the decision back to the states,â she says.    JP Morgan, Levi Strauss and Microsoft are among the major US corporations rushing to protect their employees' access to abortion, covering expenses for those who travel for the procedure. Yesterday's ruling - and the abortion bans now expected in at least 13 states - means that millions of US women will have to drive hundreds of miles to get to the nearest clinic. ""We recognise the impact of the ruling and that we remain committed to providing comprehensive access to quality and affordable care for all of our employees, cast members and their families, including family planning and reproductive care, no matter where they live,"" Disney said in a statement. The pro-choice stance taken by so many US companies, including Apple, Tesla, Yelp, Citigroup, Netflix and Lyft, has already generated some backlash from Republican lawmakers, who have threatened to cancel contracts with companies offering support for abortion. In Texas, a state lawmaker has introduced a bill that would prevent companies from doing business with local governments in the state if they provide abortion-related benefits to their employees. Here's a flavour of the demonstrations and celebrations which cascaded across the US in the hours after the highest court in the US reversed the Roe v Wade ruling. More protests have been taking place today, including outside the courthouse in Washington. This video can not be played Protests after US Supreme Court abortion ruling Demonstrators take to the streets after court overturns Roe v Wade ruling. The decision, released on Friday morning, will have repercussions in the US for years to come. With the ruling, the conservative-majority court effectively ended the constitutional right to an abortion. Five justices were in favour: Samuel Alito, Clarence Thomas, Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett. Chief Justice John Roberts wrote a separate opinion saying that he supported an abortion law in Mississippi at the centre of the case but he would not have overturned Roe v Wade. The three other justices disagreed with the majority - Stephen Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kaga. Here are some key passages from the landmark ruling: ""Roe was egregiously wrong from the start. Its reasoning was exceptionally weak, and the decision has had damaging consequences. And far from bringing about a national settlement of the abortion issue, Roe and Casey have enflamed debate and deepened division"" Samuel Alito, writing for the majority, Supreme Court justice ""It is time to heed the Constitution and return the issue of abortion to the peopleâs elected representatives"" Samuel Alito, writing for the majority, Supreme Court justice âThe majority would allow States to ban abortion from conception onward because it does not think forced childbirth at all implicates a womanâs rights to equality and freedom. Todayâs Court, that is, does not think there is anything of constitutional significance attached to a womanâs control of her body and the path of her lifeâ Justices Stephen Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan, in the dissent, Supreme Court justices âWhatever the exact scope of the coming laws, one result of todayâs decision is certain: the curtailment of womenâs rights, and of their status as free and equal citizensâ Justices Stephen Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan, in the dissent, Supreme Court justices Pro-choice protester Guido Reichstadter began climbing the huge Frederick Douglass Memorial Bridge on Friday morning and remains there more than 24 hours later.

Minnesota has joined a handful of other US states, including California, Oregon and Washington, in saying it will ensure women can seek abortion there if they face restrictive laws in their homes states. âMy office has been and will continue to be a firewall against legislation that would reverse reproductive freedom,"" said Minnesota Governor Tim Walz in a statement on Saturday.   President Biden will come under increasing pressure from Democrats to reform - especially to expand - the highest court in the US in the wake of Friday's historic abortion decision. Biden launched a commission in April 2021 to explore possible reforms, but it avoided taking a position in its final report on so-called ""court packing"" by adding justices to the current nine on the bench - though it said it there was no legal obstacle in doing so. Adding more justices to the court could shift the ideological balance of the bench, which currently leans conservative. On Saturday, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre threw cold water on the possibility. She told journalists travelling with the president to a G7 meeting in Europe that expanding the court ""is something that the president does not agree with"". ""That is not something that he wants to do."" She said there was ""no final decision"" she could share on any other proposed reforms, which include possible term limits for justices. Nomia IqbalBBC News, Washington Pro-choice activists are surrounding the few people who are anti-abortion here by the courthouse in Washington DC. One man with a sign âJesus Savesâ shouts that he loves everybody as a group of women gather around him shouting âMy body, my choice!â. He eventually moves away after a few minutes of confrontation and chanting at each other. Police are still stood in front of the heavily secured Supreme Court building. If you're just joining us, or would like a refresher on what's been going on today - here are some of the day's main headlines so far on the day after the US Supreme Court overturned the constitutional right to abortion. Biden's criticism continues- President Joe Biden, who yesterday described the ruling as a ""tragic error"", has spoken out again. After signing a landmark gun control bill into law - the first in decades, but which has been overshadowed by the abortion verdict - Biden was asked whether the court is a broken institution, and replied: ""I think the Supreme Court has made some terrible decisions.""  Demonstrations continue- Abortion-rights supporters have been protesting across the US again, with events planned around the nation over the weekend. Crowds have gathered again outside the Supreme Court building in Washington DC - but pro-life activists are there too. Friday's protests were largely peaceful, though police fired tear gas on protesters in Phoenix, Arizona, and police in riot gear moved to disperse a hard core of protesters in downtown Los Angeles. Global reaction continues- As well as protests in the US, there have been demonstrations in major cities around the world, while international leaders such as Canada's Justin Trudeau, French President Emmanual Macron and New Zealand's Jacinda Ardern have voiced their dismay over the ruling. And female US celebrities from a variety of sectors have spoken of their anger or sadness, including singer Bille Eilish, tennis star Coco Gauff and US soccer icon Megan Rapinoe. Actual changes have started- Several states have already moved to make abortion illegal, with new laws immediately imposed in Arkansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Missouri, Oklahoma, South Dakota and Utah. Abortion clinics have been closing and a senator in Oklahoma told the BBC anyone carrying out an abortion there now could face five years in jail. Teenage US tennis star Coco Gauff says she is disappointed by the US Supreme Court's decision, in a pre-Wimbledon news conference. The 18-year-old has previously used her platform to comment on social issues, andwrote ""Peace - end gun violence"" on a camera lensafter she won the semi-final at the French Open last month. ""Obviously I feel bad for future women and women now, but I also feel bad for those who protested for this, I don't even know how many years ago, but protested for this (and) are alive to see that decision to be reversed,"" Reuters quotes Gauff as saying. She tells reporters in London she feels like ""we're almost going backwards"" and says she's concerned it could lead to the reversal of other things people worked hard to achieve in the past. ""I still want to encourage people to use their voice and not feel too discouraged about this because we can definitely make a change, and hopefully change will happen,"" Gauff adds. Anthony ZurcherBBC North America reporter It's been 50 years since the legality of abortion was determined by votes, so the electoral implications of returning this power to the states are difficult to predict. When abortion rights were protected by Supreme Court precedent, public opinion surveys generally indicated that it was conservatives who were more motivated to vote based on the issue. Democrats, with the status quo on their side, were less inclined to make abortion a top issue. But recent polls suggest that calculus may change now that Roe is gone. According to a CBS News survey in May, 40% of Democrats said they would be more likely to vote if Roe v Wade were overturned, compared to only 17% of Republicans. If Democrats are able to use the abortion issue to energise their base, it could give their hopes of electoral success new life despite a president struggling with low popularity and a challenging economic climate. Control of the US Congress, which could pass legislation protecting or banning abortion nationally, is also up for grabs. Democrats have a slim majority in the House of Representatives and are tied 50-50 in the US Senate, maintaining control only through Vice-President Kamala Harris' tie-breaking vote. Even the slightest shifts in electoral winds in the months before November's votes could have dramatic implications for abortion rights across the US. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Liam Gallagher fans have been urged to consider their travel options for Sunday's concert in Glasgow due to the fallout from the third rail strike. Services across the country will be disrupted as signal boxes reopen at staggered times after the 24-hour walkout on Saturday. About 50,000 people are expected to attend the ex-Oasis star's Hampden gig. ScotRail is encouraging people to arrive early as reduced hourly services will be running. As a result of thetemporary timetable,,externalwhich has been in place since 5 June, the last train back to the city centre will leave at 20:38. There will also be no trains from Mount Florida or Kings Park after the event finishes. And there will be no trains out of the city centre after the concert ends at 22:30.â¯ Network Rail strike: Scotland likely to see more 24-hour walkouts Network Rail strike: Passengers stay away as nine in 10 trains cancelled Which trains will run in Scotland during the strike? Phil Campbell, ScotRail head of customer operations, said:â¯â¯""We'll be doing what we can to help Liam Gallagher fans travel to Hampden Park on Sunday, but customers should plan ahead as services will be impacted by Saturday's Network Rail RMT strike action, engineering work near Haymarket and Barrhead, and by the temporary timetable we currently have in place. ""Services between Glasgow Central and Mount Florida, and between Glasgow Central and Kings Park are expected to be exceptionally busy due the reduced temporary Sunday timetable, so we're encouraging customers to travel to the stadium early if they can or consider what alternative transport is available."" About 40,000 Network Rail staff have taken part in the strike in a dispute over pay, working conditions and redundancies. ScotRail cancelled 90% of its services on Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday. Cross-border services have also been badly affected. On the days of strike action the operator is only running services on five routes across the country between the hours of 07:30 and 18:30. These routes are: Edinburgh to Glasgow via Falkirk High: two trains per hour Edinburgh to Bathgate: two trains per hour Glasgow to Hamilton/Larkhall: two trains per hour Glasgow to Lanark: two trains per hour Edinburgh to Glasgow via Shotts: one train per hour In a bid to reduce pressure on the limited services ScotRail is advising customers to only travel if they really need to and to consider alternative options where possible. It is believed many people have chosen to work at home on strike days, with Transport Scotland reporting no significant increase in road traffic. First Glasgow said there was a 13% increase on bus passengers in the city on Tuesday compared with the same time last week. Deputy First Minister John Swinney called for ""more urgency"" from UK ministers and the Department for Transport (DfT) to break the deadlock. In response the DfT said it was encouraging the unions and industry to agree a deal to call off the strikes. The RMT said Network Rail's plans to cut 2,500 jobs would put safety at risk and has warned that strikes could continue over the next six months. Network Rail Scotland said it was keen to reach a resolution but stressed any deal that was done had to be fair on both its workers and on the taxpayer.

If you're just joining us, or would like a refresher on what's been going on today - here are some of the day's main headlines so far on the day after the US Supreme Court overturned the constitutional right to abortion. Biden's criticism continues- President Joe Biden, who yesterday described the ruling as a ""tragic error"", has spoken out again. After signing a landmark gun control bill into law - the first in decades, but which has been overshadowed by the abortion verdict - Biden was asked whether the court is a broken institution, and replied: ""I think the Supreme Court has made some terrible decisions.""

Global reaction continues- As well as protests in the US, there have been demonstrations in major cities around the world, while international leaders such as Canada's Justin Trudeau, French President Emmanual Macron and New Zealand's Jacinda Ardern have voiced their dismay over the ruling. And female US celebrities from a variety of sectors have spoken of their anger or sadness, including singer Bille Eilish, tennis star Coco Gauff and US soccer icon Megan Rapinoe. Actual changes have started- Several states have already moved to make abortion illegal, with new laws immediately imposed in Arkansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Missouri, Oklahoma, South Dakota and Utah. Abortion clinics have been closing and a senator in Oklahoma told the BBC anyone carrying out an abortion there now could face five years in jail. Teenage US tennis star Coco Gauff says she is disappointed by the US Supreme Court's decision, in a pre-Wimbledon news conference. The 18-year-old has previously used her platform to comment on social issues, andwrote ""Peace - end gun violence"" on a camera lensafter she won the semi-final at the French Open last month.

""I still want to encourage people to use their voice and not feel too discouraged about this because we can definitely make a change, and hopefully change will happen,"" Gauff adds. Anthony ZurcherBBC North America reporter It's been 50 years since the legality of abortion was determined by votes, so the electoral implications of returning this power to the states are difficult to predict. When abortion rights were protected by Supreme Court precedent, public opinion surveys generally indicated that it was conservatives who were more motivated to vote based on the issue. Democrats, with the status quo on their side, were less inclined to make abortion a top issue. But recent polls suggest that calculus may change now that Roe is gone. According to a CBS News survey in May, 40% of Democrats said they would be more likely to vote if Roe v Wade were overturned, compared to only 17% of Republicans. If Democrats are able to use the abortion issue to energise their base, it could give their hopes of electoral success new life despite a president struggling with low popularity and a challenging economic climate. Control of the US Congress, which could pass legislation protecting or banning abortion nationally, is also up for grabs. Democrats have a slim majority in the House of Representatives and are tied 50-50 in the US Senate, maintaining control only through Vice-President Kamala Harris' tie-breaking vote. Even the slightest shifts in electoral winds in the months before November's votes could have dramatic implications for abortion rights across the US. Â© 2025 BBC.

"This video can not be played Watch: Moments that made this by-election historic This is an important mood-making week for our biggest political parties. Encounters with the electorate always mould the mojo of our political leaders. For when you are in the popularity business, the verdict of voters, however geographically piecemeal, can't be ignored. But there can be other catalysts that prompt a smile or a frown, and both the Scottish National Party and Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party each face one of those moments in the coming days too. Six takeaways for Tories from by-election doorsteps Tory chairman quits after by-election losses Starmer hails great result for Labour in Wakefield But let's take a look first at the Conservatives, Labour and the Liberal Democrats. The result in Wakefield in West Yorkshire was less surprising but more important than the one in Devon. Why? Because if Labour are to win a general election they need to take seats, and lots of them, from the Conservatives. The party is pleased that, were themargin of Labour's victory there to be repeated at a general election(a big if, as they acknowledge, as by-elections are not about electing a government), they would have won a majority. They take issue with the election guru Sir John Curtice's analysis. Professor Sir John, of Strathclyde University, said the result implied there was still a question mark about the electorate's enthusiasm for Labour, as opposed to distaste for the Conservatives, given the decline in the Conservative vote was more than twice as big as the rise in the Labour vote. Senior figures point out that plenty assumed when Sir Keir Starmer became Labour leader that such was the electoral mountain the party faced,  he would never himself make it to Downing Street, but instead make it possible for his successor to do so. ""The mantra in the office is we have to be Kinnock and Blair,"" says one source, a reference to Lord Kinnock's rebuilding of the party and Sir Tony's delivery of an election victory. They believe such a victory is now seen as doable. Another source recently described the Starmer project thus far as ""climbing out of the grave"" dug for them by former leader Jeremy Corbyn. Parts one and two of the plan were detoxifying their brand, as they saw it, and portraying the government as inept. They feel they have done both these things. The third stage, which plenty of figures including influential ones in the shadow cabinet are getting impatient to see, is the case for why people should vote Labour. Theinvestigation by Durham Constabulary into alleged Covid law breaking by Sir Keir and his deputy Angela Raynerhas hamstrung that and it won't begin in earnest until - if - they are cleared. Planning is under way for the party conference in the autumn; after last year's focus on internal Labour machinations, this year's will be about their pitch to the country. What, then, of the Liberal Democrats? They, in the words of one, are ""super chipper"" this weekend. Little wonder; a third whopping win against the Conservatives in a by-election a year. Conservatives have been known to privately describe Lib Dems as the 'yellow peril', a backhanded compliment to their by-election savvy, energy and ruthlessness. The coalition years doused their brand in a political poison for many. The antidote of time appears to have washed much of that away. They are still parliamentary tiddlers - 14 MPs out of 650, just 2% of the Commons. Lib Dem leader Ed Davey joined his newest MP Richard Foorde to celebrate his win But they could play an outsized role in the politics of the next few years, injecting fear into the Conservative psyche about their potential capacity to wipe out swathes of Tory MPs. One thing the Lib Dems are irritated by is the grumbles of Conservatives, most notably the Health Secretary Sajid Javid this weekend, about talk of a deal between the Lib Dems and Labour to work together to eject Tory MPs. As Sir John Curtice has said, there appears to be a growing willingness of voters to vote for whichever party locally is best able to beat the Conservatives. Both Labour and the Lib Dems insist there is no deal, there is no pact, it's parties focusing on where they can win. Lib Dem sources also point out they couldn't possibly have won and won so big in three previously rock solid Conservative seats without luring former Tory voters to them, including, especially in Tiverton and Honiton, plenty who voted Leave. Next: the Conservatives. It's 30 years since a party lost two by elections on the same day. The last time it happened, it was the Conservatives again who were on the receiving end of two chunks of the electorate's ire. On 7 November 1991, they lost Kincardine and Deeside to the Liberal Democrats and Langbaurgh in North Yorkshire to Labour. And what happened at the general election six months later? The Conservatives won them both back. The idea that by-elections can be a psephological quirk â and they can be â and exaggerate a party's popularity or otherwise, is what Tories cling to this weekend. Boris Johnson told the BBC a ""psychological transformation"" in his character is ""not going to happen"" But plenty of Boris Johnson's internal critics think the electorate's judgement on the prime minister's character is set and little can change that. His supporters hope his previous bounce-back-ability has at least one more boing in it. Finally, then, to the DUP and the SNP. Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionists are refusing to go into devolved government at Stormont. They say they won't go back into power sharing until the part of the Brexit deal called theNorthern Ireland Protocolis radically altered, removing that sense from many unionists that it was unpicking the stitches that hold the UK together, the overarching fear of their political creed. On Monday, the proposed change in the law that could ditch chunks of the Protocol will be debated in the Commons. Some are outraged at what they see as the government intentionally breaking international law. Ministers insist it won't do that. What we shouldn't expect is rapid movement from the DUP. They feel they've been repeatedly let down by Boris Johnson and they have a mandate to ensure they get the Protocol sorted, as they see it, before returning to Stormont. Second reading of protocol bill set for next week DUP 'in denial' about financial situation in NI Debating the Protocol Bill won't be enough to resolve that impasse. And so to the Scottish National Party. The first thing which always bears repeating is how, 15 years into government at Holyrood, they continue to be the colossus of Scottish politics; everyone else a shrimp in comparison. It doesn't insulate them from problems; their Westminster leader Ian Blackford has faced calls to resign over his party's handling of a sexual harassment complaint. This video can not be played Ian Blackford apologises to victim and says Patrick Grady should ""reflect"" on behaviour Not only has it raised questions about Mr Blackford's judgement in the eyes of his critics, but proven there is at least one mole within his ranks who has recorded and leaked what was meant to be a private meeting. On Tuesday, party leader and Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon will set out how she plans to ""unlock the door to another independence referendum"", as one figure put it to me. Exactly how they do that, with Boris Johnson refusing to countenance one, will be interesting. It'll be a big moment at the core of the SNP's very reason for being - and so itself a mood-maker for them and Scottish politics more broadly.

"US President Joe Biden says ""the Supreme Court has made some terrible decisions"", the day after it ended the constitutional right to abortion Demonstrators are taking to the streets again - crowds have gathered outside the Supreme Court building in Washington DC Dozens of protests are planned around the US over the weekend by pro-choice activists But anti-abortion campaigners have been celebrating after the court reversed its 50-year-old Roe v Wade decision Some states have vowed to become ""safe havens"" for women seeking abortions but about half are likely to introduce new restrictions or bans And 13 have so-called trigger laws in place that will see abortion quickly banned - some clinics have begun shutting down already Edited by Tom Geoghegan Thank you for following the day's events with us. There was a second day of protests across the US in the wake of the historic Supreme Court decision that ended the constitutional right to abortion. US President Joe Biden criticised the court again on Saturday, saying it  ""has made some terrible decisions"". Thirteen states have so-called trigger laws in place that will see abortion quickly banned - some clinics begun shutting down immediately after the ruling. Contributors to the page today were Tom Geoghegan, Holly Honderich, Jessica Murphy, Sam Cabral, James Clarke, Nathan Williams and Robin Levinson-King. Shortly after the Supreme Court decision on Friday, President Biden urged pro-choice Americans to head to the polls and elect politicians who support abortion rights. Democrats will seek to use the abortion issue to energise their base, and for some voters, ensuring Democrats control Congress could take on fresh urgency. Biden is also likely to come under increasing pressure to reform the Supreme Court. Individual states, including Minnesota, Washington, Oregon, and California, and cities like New York, have vowed to offer reproductive care to women living in states where abortion is banned. Campaigners have also been putting in place efforts to ensure women travelling from out-of-state have access to support - and the financial funds - needed to access abortion services. At a state level, new laws restricting abortion are already being challenged. Planned Parenthood in Utah filed a lawsuit on Saturday challenging the constitutionality of the stateâs abortion ban. And earlier this month, a synagogue in Florida sued the state, arguing a law that will ban most abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy as of 1 July, violates religious freedoms. Pro-choice campaigners are also seeking to improve access to abortion medication, especially in states where abortion is heavily restricted. Medication was used in just over 50% of abortions in the US in 2020, according to data from the Guttmacher Institute, which supports abortion rights.   Protesters don Handmaid's Tale costumes to protest about the nomination of conservative Justice Amy Coney Barrett In Margaret Atwood's 1985 novel The Handmaid's Tale - now a hit TV series - she imagined a fictional American dystopia. Writing in The Atlantic, she says the US Supreme Court has brought Gilead to life. ""In the fictional theocracy of Gilead, women had very few rights, as in 17th Century New England. The Bible was cherry-picked, with the cherries being interpreted literally. Although I eventually completed this novel and called it The Handmaidâs Tale, I stopped writing it several times, because I considered it too far-fetched. Silly me. The Alito opinion purports to be based on Americaâs Constitution. But it relies on English jurisprudence from the 17th Century, a time when a belief in witchcraft caused the death of many innocent people. If Justice Alito wants you to be governed by the laws of the 17th Century, you should take a close look at that century. Is that when you want to live?"" Read Atwood's piece here,external Kathleen McClellan from Breaux Bridge, Louisiana, told the BBC she thinks yesterday's ruling is a step forward for America. ""Yesterday I was overjoyed to hear the news that Roe had been overturned. My employer called me as soon as he heard about it and he was extremely grateful also. I went to Mass on my lunch break and the priest was so moved by the Supreme Court decision that he broke into tears during his homily. ""Legislation protecting human life in every stage of development and ability is another humane goal that Americans can now freely enact state by state. My state of Louisiana has chosen to do that and I'm proud of our governor and legislators."" Holly HonderichBBC News, Washington For Mississippi Attorney General Lynn Fitch, this weekend is one of celebration. ""It's a great day for the American people,"" she said. ""Roe v Wade is now behind us."" Fitch can take some personal credit for the ruling. Under her direction, her state asked the Supreme Court to uphold Mississippi's abortion ban and slash Roe v Wade in the process. The case, according to Fitch, was about ""women's empowerment"". Abortion, she said, offered women a false choice - motherhood or career, not both. ""Fifty years ago, for professional women, they wanted you to make a choice. Now you don't have to,"" she said last year. ""You have the option in life to really achieve your dreams, your goals, and you can have those beautiful children as well."" Read more:The woman who helped topple Roe The crowds gathered again on Saturday but not in the same numbers A pro-choice protester outside the court Two demonstrators stand off Protesters take a break from the June heat Planned Parenthood Association of Utah and the American Civil Liberties Union of Utah have filed a lawsuit against a state law banning all abortions. Utah is one of the states that moved to immediately ban abortion after Friday's Supreme Court decision. The lawsuit, filed on Saturday, argues that Utah's abortion ban violates the state's constitution and asks for a restraining order to block it from being enforced. Utah's so-called ""trigger law"" bans abortion in the state, expect in rare cases, including verifiable rape or incest and where the mother's life is at risk or if the pregnancy poses a threat of ""substantial and irreversible impairment of a major bodily functionâ.  Friday's Supreme Court decision was decades in the making, and a major victory for the anti-abortion campaigners in the United States. So after overturning the 50-year-old Roe v Wade - the landmark US ruling that made abortion a constitutional right - what comes next for the movement? Many see overturning Roe v Wade as just the beginning of its work. Some of the battle will now move to the state level, since the ruling means individual states are free to set their own rules. Carol Tobias, President of National Right to Life, has said overturning Roe means campaigners will now move to âencourage as many states as possible to ban abortion to whatever extent they canâ. Others, including the Susan B Anthony List, which supports anti-abortion politicians, have called on increasing efforts to financially support families and new mothers. In the Atlantic,,externalconservative Christian and commentator David French points to policies like Senator Mitt Romneyâs proposed Family Security Act, which would offer monthly financial assistance to expecting mothers and families with children. âThe Romney plan isnât the answer to child poverty and family financial insecurity, but it is an answer, and its concrete financial support for mothers and children would be a tangible statement of our nationâs moral commitment to young families,â he writes.

US footballer Megan Rapinoe has spoken emotionally about the impact the Roe v Wade overturning will have on her, her teammates and others. At a team news conference in Denver, Colorado, Rapinoe, one of the stars of the US women's national team, said she wanted to talk about football, but the anti-abortion ruling took precedence. This video can not be played Roe v Wade: How sad a day this is - Rapinoe Catherine Lewis, 56, from North Carolina, says she thinks that Fridayâs Supreme Court decision was âcorrect from a constitutional perspectiveâ. âI am always for supporting state's rights and this merely puts the decision back into the individual state's hands to decide what's best for their citizens,â she tells the BBC. Lewis says she is opposed to abortion âbecause I am a firm believer in the sanctity of lifeâ. âIn fact, I just wrote my friend's memoir where she explains that she was glad that her parents chose life for her rather than abortion so that she could live."" One part of her message to those who oppose her view would be to âchallenge them to think outside their political talking points and really dive into the issueâ. âLook at it from a legal perspective and understand what Scotus did by sending the decision back to the states,â she says.    JP Morgan, Levi Strauss and Microsoft are among the major US corporations rushing to protect their employees' access to abortion, covering expenses for those who travel for the procedure. Yesterday's ruling - and the abortion bans now expected in at least 13 states - means that millions of US women will have to drive hundreds of miles to get to the nearest clinic. ""We recognise the impact of the ruling and that we remain committed to providing comprehensive access to quality and affordable care for all of our employees, cast members and their families, including family planning and reproductive care, no matter where they live,"" Disney said in a statement. The pro-choice stance taken by so many US companies, including Apple, Tesla, Yelp, Citigroup, Netflix and Lyft, has already generated some backlash from Republican lawmakers, who have threatened to cancel contracts with companies offering support for abortion. In Texas, a state lawmaker has introduced a bill that would prevent companies from doing business with local governments in the state if they provide abortion-related benefits to their employees. Here's a flavour of the demonstrations and celebrations which cascaded across the US in the hours after the highest court in the US reversed the Roe v Wade ruling. More protests have been taking place today, including outside the courthouse in Washington. This video can not be played Protests after US Supreme Court abortion ruling Demonstrators take to the streets after court overturns Roe v Wade ruling. The decision, released on Friday morning, will have repercussions in the US for years to come. With the ruling, the conservative-majority court effectively ended the constitutional right to an abortion. Five justices were in favour: Samuel Alito, Clarence Thomas, Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett. Chief Justice John Roberts wrote a separate opinion saying that he supported an abortion law in Mississippi at the centre of the case but he would not have overturned Roe v Wade. The three other justices disagreed with the majority - Stephen Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kaga. Here are some key passages from the landmark ruling: ""Roe was egregiously wrong from the start. Its reasoning was exceptionally weak, and the decision has had damaging consequences. And far from bringing about a national settlement of the abortion issue, Roe and Casey have enflamed debate and deepened division"" Samuel Alito, writing for the majority, Supreme Court justice ""It is time to heed the Constitution and return the issue of abortion to the peopleâs elected representatives"" Samuel Alito, writing for the majority, Supreme Court justice âThe majority would allow States to ban abortion from conception onward because it does not think forced childbirth at all implicates a womanâs rights to equality and freedom. Todayâs Court, that is, does not think there is anything of constitutional significance attached to a womanâs control of her body and the path of her lifeâ Justices Stephen Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan, in the dissent, Supreme Court justices âWhatever the exact scope of the coming laws, one result of todayâs decision is certain: the curtailment of womenâs rights, and of their status as free and equal citizensâ Justices Stephen Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan, in the dissent, Supreme Court justices Pro-choice protester Guido Reichstadter began climbing the huge Frederick Douglass Memorial Bridge on Friday morning and remains there more than 24 hours later.

The third stage, which plenty of figures including influential ones in the shadow cabinet are getting impatient to see, is the case for why people should vote Labour. Theinvestigation by Durham Constabulary into alleged Covid law breaking by Sir Keir and his deputy Angela Raynerhas hamstrung that and it won't begin in earnest until - if - they are cleared. Planning is under way for the party conference in the autumn; after last year's focus on internal Labour machinations, this year's will be about their pitch to the country. What, then, of the Liberal Democrats? They, in the words of one, are ""super chipper"" this weekend. Little wonder; a third whopping win against the Conservatives in a by-election a year. Conservatives have been known to privately describe Lib Dems as the 'yellow peril', a backhanded compliment to their by-election savvy, energy and ruthlessness. The coalition years doused their brand in a political poison for many. The antidote of time appears to have washed much of that away. They are still parliamentary tiddlers - 14 MPs out of 650, just 2% of the Commons. Lib Dem leader Ed Davey joined his newest MP Richard Foorde to celebrate his win But they could play an outsized role in the politics of the next few years, injecting fear into the Conservative psyche about their potential capacity to wipe out swathes of Tory MPs. One thing the Lib Dems are irritated by is the grumbles of Conservatives, most notably the Health Secretary Sajid Javid this weekend, about talk of a deal between the Lib Dems and Labour to work together to eject Tory MPs. As Sir John Curtice has said, there appears to be a growing willingness of voters to vote for whichever party locally is best able to beat the Conservatives. Both Labour and the Lib Dems insist there is no deal, there is no pact, it's parties focusing on where they can win. Lib Dem sources also point out they couldn't possibly have won and won so big in three previously rock solid Conservative seats without luring former Tory voters to them, including, especially in Tiverton and Honiton, plenty who voted Leave. Next: the Conservatives. It's 30 years since a party lost two by elections on the same day. The last time it happened, it was the Conservatives again who were on the receiving end of two chunks of the electorate's ire. On 7 November 1991, they lost Kincardine and Deeside to the Liberal Democrats and Langbaurgh in North Yorkshire to Labour. And what happened at the general election six months later? The Conservatives won them both back. The idea that by-elections can be a psephological quirk â and they can be â and exaggerate a party's popularity or otherwise, is what Tories cling to this weekend. Boris Johnson told the BBC a ""psychological transformation"" in his character is ""not going to happen"" But plenty of Boris Johnson's internal critics think the electorate's judgement on the prime minister's character is set and little can change that. His supporters hope his previous bounce-back-ability has at least one more boing in it. Finally, then, to the DUP and the SNP. Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionists are refusing to go into devolved government at Stormont. They say they won't go back into power sharing until the part of the Brexit deal called theNorthern Ireland Protocolis radically altered, removing that sense from many unionists that it was unpicking the stitches that hold the UK together, the overarching fear of their political creed. On Monday, the proposed change in the law that could ditch chunks of the Protocol will be debated in the Commons. Some are outraged at what they see as the government intentionally breaking international law. Ministers insist it won't do that. What we shouldn't expect is rapid movement from the DUP. They feel they've been repeatedly let down by Boris Johnson and they have a mandate to ensure they get the Protocol sorted, as they see it, before returning to Stormont. Second reading of protocol bill set for next week DUP 'in denial' about financial situation in NI Debating the Protocol Bill won't be enough to resolve that impasse. And so to the Scottish National Party. The first thing which always bears repeating is how, 15 years into government at Holyrood, they continue to be the colossus of Scottish politics; everyone else a shrimp in comparison. It doesn't insulate them from problems; their Westminster leader Ian Blackford has faced calls to resign over his party's handling of a sexual harassment complaint. This video can not be played Ian Blackford apologises to victim and says Patrick Grady should ""reflect"" on behaviour Not only has it raised questions about Mr Blackford's judgement in the eyes of his critics, but proven there is at least one mole within his ranks who has recorded and leaked what was meant to be a private meeting. On Tuesday, party leader and Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon will set out how she plans to ""unlock the door to another independence referendum"", as one figure put it to me. Exactly how they do that, with Boris Johnson refusing to countenance one, will be interesting. It'll be a big moment at the core of the SNP's very reason for being - and so itself a mood-maker for them and Scottish politics more broadly.

"US President Joe Biden says ""the Supreme Court has made some terrible decisions"", the day after it ended the constitutional right to abortion Demonstrators are taking to the streets again - crowds have gathered outside the Supreme Court building in Washington DC Dozens of protests are planned around the US over the weekend by pro-choice activists But anti-abortion campaigners have been celebrating after the court reversed its 50-year-old Roe v Wade decision Some states have vowed to become ""safe havens"" for women seeking abortions but about half are likely to introduce new restrictions or bans And 13 have so-called trigger laws in place that will see abortion quickly banned - some clinics have begun shutting down already Edited by Tom Geoghegan Thank you for following the day's events with us. There was a second day of protests across the US in the wake of the historic Supreme Court decision that ended the constitutional right to abortion. US President Joe Biden criticised the court again on Saturday, saying it  ""has made some terrible decisions"". Thirteen states have so-called trigger laws in place that will see abortion quickly banned - some clinics begun shutting down immediately after the ruling. Contributors to the page today were Tom Geoghegan, Holly Honderich, Jessica Murphy, Sam Cabral, James Clarke, Nathan Williams and Robin Levinson-King. Shortly after the Supreme Court decision on Friday, President Biden urged pro-choice Americans to head to the polls and elect politicians who support abortion rights. Democrats will seek to use the abortion issue to energise their base, and for some voters, ensuring Democrats control Congress could take on fresh urgency. Biden is also likely to come under increasing pressure to reform the Supreme Court. Individual states, including Minnesota, Washington, Oregon, and California, and cities like New York, have vowed to offer reproductive care to women living in states where abortion is banned. Campaigners have also been putting in place efforts to ensure women travelling from out-of-state have access to support - and the financial funds - needed to access abortion services. At a state level, new laws restricting abortion are already being challenged. Planned Parenthood in Utah filed a lawsuit on Saturday challenging the constitutionality of the stateâs abortion ban. And earlier this month, a synagogue in Florida sued the state, arguing a law that will ban most abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy as of 1 July, violates religious freedoms. Pro-choice campaigners are also seeking to improve access to abortion medication, especially in states where abortion is heavily restricted. Medication was used in just over 50% of abortions in the US in 2020, according to data from the Guttmacher Institute, which supports abortion rights.   Protesters don Handmaid's Tale costumes to protest about the nomination of conservative Justice Amy Coney Barrett In Margaret Atwood's 1985 novel The Handmaid's Tale - now a hit TV series - she imagined a fictional American dystopia. Writing in The Atlantic, she says the US Supreme Court has brought Gilead to life. ""In the fictional theocracy of Gilead, women had very few rights, as in 17th Century New England. The Bible was cherry-picked, with the cherries being interpreted literally. Although I eventually completed this novel and called it The Handmaidâs Tale, I stopped writing it several times, because I considered it too far-fetched. Silly me. The Alito opinion purports to be based on Americaâs Constitution. But it relies on English jurisprudence from the 17th Century, a time when a belief in witchcraft caused the death of many innocent people. If Justice Alito wants you to be governed by the laws of the 17th Century, you should take a close look at that century. Is that when you want to live?"" Read Atwood's piece here,external Kathleen McClellan from Breaux Bridge, Louisiana, told the BBC she thinks yesterday's ruling is a step forward for America. ""Yesterday I was overjoyed to hear the news that Roe had been overturned. My employer called me as soon as he heard about it and he was extremely grateful also. I went to Mass on my lunch break and the priest was so moved by the Supreme Court decision that he broke into tears during his homily. ""Legislation protecting human life in every stage of development and ability is another humane goal that Americans can now freely enact state by state. My state of Louisiana has chosen to do that and I'm proud of our governor and legislators."" Holly HonderichBBC News, Washington For Mississippi Attorney General Lynn Fitch, this weekend is one of celebration. ""It's a great day for the American people,"" she said. ""Roe v Wade is now behind us."" Fitch can take some personal credit for the ruling. Under her direction, her state asked the Supreme Court to uphold Mississippi's abortion ban and slash Roe v Wade in the process. The case, according to Fitch, was about ""women's empowerment"". Abortion, she said, offered women a false choice - motherhood or career, not both. ""Fifty years ago, for professional women, they wanted you to make a choice. Now you don't have to,"" she said last year. ""You have the option in life to really achieve your dreams, your goals, and you can have those beautiful children as well."" Read more:The woman who helped topple Roe The crowds gathered again on Saturday but not in the same numbers A pro-choice protester outside the court Two demonstrators stand off Protesters take a break from the June heat Planned Parenthood Association of Utah and the American Civil Liberties Union of Utah have filed a lawsuit against a state law banning all abortions. Utah is one of the states that moved to immediately ban abortion after Friday's Supreme Court decision. The lawsuit, filed on Saturday, argues that Utah's abortion ban violates the state's constitution and asks for a restraining order to block it from being enforced. Utah's so-called ""trigger law"" bans abortion in the state, expect in rare cases, including verifiable rape or incest and where the mother's life is at risk or if the pregnancy poses a threat of ""substantial and irreversible impairment of a major bodily functionâ.  Friday's Supreme Court decision was decades in the making, and a major victory for the anti-abortion campaigners in the United States. So after overturning the 50-year-old Roe v Wade - the landmark US ruling that made abortion a constitutional right - what comes next for the movement? Many see overturning Roe v Wade as just the beginning of its work. Some of the battle will now move to the state level, since the ruling means individual states are free to set their own rules. Carol Tobias, President of National Right to Life, has said overturning Roe means campaigners will now move to âencourage as many states as possible to ban abortion to whatever extent they canâ. Others, including the Susan B Anthony List, which supports anti-abortion politicians, have called on increasing efforts to financially support families and new mothers. In the Atlantic,,externalconservative Christian and commentator David French points to policies like Senator Mitt Romneyâs proposed Family Security Act, which would offer monthly financial assistance to expecting mothers and families with children. âThe Romney plan isnât the answer to child poverty and family financial insecurity, but it is an answer, and its concrete financial support for mothers and children would be a tangible statement of our nationâs moral commitment to young families,â he writes.

US footballer Megan Rapinoe has spoken emotionally about the impact the Roe v Wade overturning will have on her, her teammates and others. At a team news conference in Denver, Colorado, Rapinoe, one of the stars of the US women's national team, said she wanted to talk about football, but the anti-abortion ruling took precedence. This video can not be played Roe v Wade: How sad a day this is - Rapinoe Catherine Lewis, 56, from North Carolina, says she thinks that Fridayâs Supreme Court decision was âcorrect from a constitutional perspectiveâ. âI am always for supporting state's rights and this merely puts the decision back into the individual state's hands to decide what's best for their citizens,â she tells the BBC. Lewis says she is opposed to abortion âbecause I am a firm believer in the sanctity of lifeâ. âIn fact, I just wrote my friend's memoir where she explains that she was glad that her parents chose life for her rather than abortion so that she could live."" One part of her message to those who oppose her view would be to âchallenge them to think outside their political talking points and really dive into the issueâ. âLook at it from a legal perspective and understand what Scotus did by sending the decision back to the states,â she says.    JP Morgan, Levi Strauss and Microsoft are among the major US corporations rushing to protect their employees' access to abortion, covering expenses for those who travel for the procedure. Yesterday's ruling - and the abortion bans now expected in at least 13 states - means that millions of US women will have to drive hundreds of miles to get to the nearest clinic. ""We recognise the impact of the ruling and that we remain committed to providing comprehensive access to quality and affordable care for all of our employees, cast members and their families, including family planning and reproductive care, no matter where they live,"" Disney said in a statement. The pro-choice stance taken by so many US companies, including Apple, Tesla, Yelp, Citigroup, Netflix and Lyft, has already generated some backlash from Republican lawmakers, who have threatened to cancel contracts with companies offering support for abortion. In Texas, a state lawmaker has introduced a bill that would prevent companies from doing business with local governments in the state if they provide abortion-related benefits to their employees. Here's a flavour of the demonstrations and celebrations which cascaded across the US in the hours after the highest court in the US reversed the Roe v Wade ruling. More protests have been taking place today, including outside the courthouse in Washington. This video can not be played Protests after US Supreme Court abortion ruling Demonstrators take to the streets after court overturns Roe v Wade ruling. The decision, released on Friday morning, will have repercussions in the US for years to come. With the ruling, the conservative-majority court effectively ended the constitutional right to an abortion. Five justices were in favour: Samuel Alito, Clarence Thomas, Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett. Chief Justice John Roberts wrote a separate opinion saying that he supported an abortion law in Mississippi at the centre of the case but he would not have overturned Roe v Wade. The three other justices disagreed with the majority - Stephen Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kaga. Here are some key passages from the landmark ruling: ""Roe was egregiously wrong from the start. Its reasoning was exceptionally weak, and the decision has had damaging consequences. And far from bringing about a national settlement of the abortion issue, Roe and Casey have enflamed debate and deepened division"" Samuel Alito, writing for the majority, Supreme Court justice ""It is time to heed the Constitution and return the issue of abortion to the peopleâs elected representatives"" Samuel Alito, writing for the majority, Supreme Court justice âThe majority would allow States to ban abortion from conception onward because it does not think forced childbirth at all implicates a womanâs rights to equality and freedom. Todayâs Court, that is, does not think there is anything of constitutional significance attached to a womanâs control of her body and the path of her lifeâ Justices Stephen Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan, in the dissent, Supreme Court justices âWhatever the exact scope of the coming laws, one result of todayâs decision is certain: the curtailment of womenâs rights, and of their status as free and equal citizensâ Justices Stephen Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan, in the dissent, Supreme Court justices Pro-choice protester Guido Reichstadter began climbing the huge Frederick Douglass Memorial Bridge on Friday morning and remains there more than 24 hours later. In a post on Twitter, he said he would rather be anywhere else but he feels strongly for abortion rights.

Minnesota has joined a handful of other US states, including California, Oregon and Washington, in saying it will ensure women can seek abortion there if they face restrictive laws in their homes states. âMy office has been and will continue to be a firewall against legislation that would reverse reproductive freedom,"" said Minnesota Governor Tim Walz in a statement on Saturday.   President Biden will come under increasing pressure from Democrats to reform - especially to expand - the highest court in the US in the wake of Friday's historic abortion decision. Biden launched a commission in April 2021 to explore possible reforms, but it avoided taking a position in its final report on so-called ""court packing"" by adding justices to the current nine on the bench - though it said it there was no legal obstacle in doing so. Adding more justices to the court could shift the ideological balance of the bench, which currently leans conservative. On Saturday, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre threw cold water on the possibility. She told journalists travelling with the president to a G7 meeting in Europe that expanding the court ""is something that the president does not agree with"". ""That is not something that he wants to do."" She said there was ""no final decision"" she could share on any other proposed reforms, which include possible term limits for justices. Nomia IqbalBBC News, Washington Pro-choice activists are surrounding the few people who are anti-abortion here by the courthouse in Washington DC. One man with a sign âJesus Savesâ shouts that he loves everybody as a group of women gather around him shouting âMy body, my choice!â. He eventually moves away after a few minutes of confrontation and chanting at each other. Police are still stood in front of the heavily secured Supreme Court building. If you're just joining us, or would like a refresher on what's been going on today - here are some of the day's main headlines so far on the day after the US Supreme Court overturned the constitutional right to abortion. Biden's criticism continues- President Joe Biden, who yesterday described the ruling as a ""tragic error"", has spoken out again. After signing a landmark gun control bill into law - the first in decades, but which has been overshadowed by the abortion verdict - Biden was asked whether the court is a broken institution, and replied: ""I think the Supreme Court has made some terrible decisions.""  Demonstrations continue- Abortion-rights supporters have been protesting across the US again, with events planned around the nation over the weekend. Crowds have gathered again outside the Supreme Court building in Washington DC - but pro-life activists are there too. Friday's protests were largely peaceful, though police fired tear gas on protesters in Phoenix, Arizona, and police in riot gear moved to disperse a hard core of protesters in downtown Los Angeles. Global reaction continues- As well as protests in the US, there have been demonstrations in major cities around the world, while international leaders such as Canada's Justin Trudeau, French President Emmanual Macron and New Zealand's Jacinda Ardern have voiced their dismay over the ruling. And female US celebrities from a variety of sectors have spoken of their anger or sadness, including singer Bille Eilish, tennis star Coco Gauff and US soccer icon Megan Rapinoe. Actual changes have started- Several states have already moved to make abortion illegal, with new laws immediately imposed in Arkansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Missouri, Oklahoma, South Dakota and Utah. Abortion clinics have been closing and a senator in Oklahoma told the BBC anyone carrying out an abortion there now could face five years in jail. Teenage US tennis star Coco Gauff says she is disappointed by the US Supreme Court's decision, in a pre-Wimbledon news conference. The 18-year-old has previously used her platform to comment on social issues, andwrote ""Peace - end gun violence"" on a camera lensafter she won the semi-final at the French Open last month. ""Obviously I feel bad for future women and women now, but I also feel bad for those who protested for this, I don't even know how many years ago, but protested for this (and) are alive to see that decision to be reversed,"" Reuters quotes Gauff as saying. She tells reporters in London she feels like ""we're almost going backwards"" and says she's concerned it could lead to the reversal of other things people worked hard to achieve in the past. ""I still want to encourage people to use their voice and not feel too discouraged about this because we can definitely make a change, and hopefully change will happen,"" Gauff adds. Anthony ZurcherBBC North America reporter It's been 50 years since the legality of abortion was determined by votes, so the electoral implications of returning this power to the states are difficult to predict. When abortion rights were protected by Supreme Court precedent, public opinion surveys generally indicated that it was conservatives who were more motivated to vote based on the issue. Democrats, with the status quo on their side, were less inclined to make abortion a top issue. But recent polls suggest that calculus may change now that Roe is gone. According to a CBS News survey in May, 40% of Democrats said they would be more likely to vote if Roe v Wade were overturned, compared to only 17% of Republicans. If Democrats are able to use the abortion issue to energise their base, it could give their hopes of electoral success new life despite a president struggling with low popularity and a challenging economic climate. Control of the US Congress, which could pass legislation protecting or banning abortion nationally, is also up for grabs. Democrats have a slim majority in the House of Representatives and are tied 50-50 in the US Senate, maintaining control only through Vice-President Kamala Harris' tie-breaking vote. Even the slightest shifts in electoral winds in the months before November's votes could have dramatic implications for abortion rights across the US. Â© 2025 BBC.

"This video can not be played Watch: Moments that made this by-election historic This is an important mood-making week for our biggest political parties. Encounters with the electorate always mould the mojo of our political leaders. For when you are in the popularity business, the verdict of voters, however geographically piecemeal, can't be ignored. But there can be other catalysts that prompt a smile or a frown, and both the Scottish National Party and Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party each face one of those moments in the coming days too. Six takeaways for Tories from by-election doorsteps Tory chairman quits after by-election losses Starmer hails great result for Labour in Wakefield But let's take a look first at the Conservatives, Labour and the Liberal Democrats. The result in Wakefield in West Yorkshire was less surprising but more important than the one in Devon. Why? Because if Labour are to win a general election they need to take seats, and lots of them, from the Conservatives. The party is pleased that, were themargin of Labour's victory there to be repeated at a general election(a big if, as they acknowledge, as by-elections are not about electing a government), they would have won a majority. They take issue with the election guru Sir John Curtice's analysis. Professor Sir John, of Strathclyde University, said the result implied there was still a question mark about the electorate's enthusiasm for Labour, as opposed to distaste for the Conservatives, given the decline in the Conservative vote was more than twice as big as the rise in the Labour vote. Senior figures point out that plenty assumed when Sir Keir Starmer became Labour leader that such was the electoral mountain the party faced,  he would never himself make it to Downing Street, but instead make it possible for his successor to do so. ""The mantra in the office is we have to be Kinnock and Blair,"" says one source, a reference to Lord Kinnock's rebuilding of the party and Sir Tony's delivery of an election victory. They believe such a victory is now seen as doable. Another source recently described the Starmer project thus far as ""climbing out of the grave"" dug for them by former leader Jeremy Corbyn. Parts one and two of the plan were detoxifying their brand, as they saw it, and portraying the government as inept. They feel they have done both these things.

Campaigners have also been putting in place efforts to ensure women travelling from out-of-state have access to support - and the financial funds - needed to access abortion services. At a state level, new laws restricting abortion are already being challenged. Planned Parenthood in Utah filed a lawsuit on Saturday challenging the constitutionality of the stateâs abortion ban. And earlier this month, a synagogue in Florida sued the state, arguing a law that will ban most abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy as of 1 July, violates religious freedoms. Pro-choice campaigners are also seeking to improve access to abortion medication, especially in states where abortion is heavily restricted. Medication was used in just over 50% of abortions in the US in 2020, according to data from the Guttmacher Institute, which supports abortion rights.   Protesters don Handmaid's Tale costumes to protest about the nomination of conservative Justice Amy Coney Barrett In Margaret Atwood's 1985 novel The Handmaid's Tale - now a hit TV series - she imagined a fictional American dystopia. Writing in The Atlantic, she says the US Supreme Court has brought Gilead to life. ""In the fictional theocracy of Gilead, women had very few rights, as in 17th Century New England. The Bible was cherry-picked, with the cherries being interpreted literally. Although I eventually completed this novel and called it The Handmaidâs Tale, I stopped writing it several times, because I considered it too far-fetched. Silly me. The Alito opinion purports to be based on Americaâs Constitution. But it relies on English jurisprudence from the 17th Century, a time when a belief in witchcraft caused the death of many innocent people. If Justice Alito wants you to be governed by the laws of the 17th Century, you should take a close look at that century. Is that when you want to live?"" Read Atwood's piece here,external Kathleen McClellan from Breaux Bridge, Louisiana, told the BBC she thinks yesterday's ruling is a step forward for America. ""Yesterday I was overjoyed to hear the news that Roe had been overturned. My employer called me as soon as he heard about it and he was extremely grateful also. I went to Mass on my lunch break and the priest was so moved by the Supreme Court decision that he broke into tears during his homily. ""Legislation protecting human life in every stage of development and ability is another humane goal that Americans can now freely enact state by state. My state of Louisiana has chosen to do that and I'm proud of our governor and legislators."" Holly HonderichBBC News, Washington For Mississippi Attorney General Lynn Fitch, this weekend is one of celebration. ""It's a great day for the American people,"" she said. ""Roe v Wade is now behind us."" Fitch can take some personal credit for the ruling. Under her direction, her state asked the Supreme Court to uphold Mississippi's abortion ban and slash Roe v Wade in the process. The case, according to Fitch, was about ""women's empowerment"". Abortion, she said, offered women a false choice - motherhood or career, not both. ""Fifty years ago, for professional women, they wanted you to make a choice. Now you don't have to,"" she said last year. ""You have the option in life to really achieve your dreams, your goals, and you can have those beautiful children as well."" Read more:The woman who helped topple Roe The crowds gathered again on Saturday but not in the same numbers A pro-choice protester outside the court Two demonstrators stand off Protesters take a break from the June heat Planned Parenthood Association of Utah and the American Civil Liberties Union of Utah have filed a lawsuit against a state law banning all abortions. Utah is one of the states that moved to immediately ban abortion after Friday's Supreme Court decision. The lawsuit, filed on Saturday, argues that Utah's abortion ban violates the state's constitution and asks for a restraining order to block it from being enforced. Utah's so-called ""trigger law"" bans abortion in the state, expect in rare cases, including verifiable rape or incest and where the mother's life is at risk or if the pregnancy poses a threat of ""substantial and irreversible impairment of a major bodily functionâ.  Friday's Supreme Court decision was decades in the making, and a major victory for the anti-abortion campaigners in the United States. So after overturning the 50-year-old Roe v Wade - the landmark US ruling that made abortion a constitutional right - what comes next for the movement? Many see overturning Roe v Wade as just the beginning of its work. Some of the battle will now move to the state level, since the ruling means individual states are free to set their own rules. Carol Tobias, President of National Right to Life, has said overturning Roe means campaigners will now move to âencourage as many states as possible to ban abortion to whatever extent they canâ. Others, including the Susan B Anthony List, which supports anti-abortion politicians, have called on increasing efforts to financially support families and new mothers. In the Atlantic,,externalconservative Christian and commentator David French points to policies like Senator Mitt Romneyâs proposed Family Security Act, which would offer monthly financial assistance to expecting mothers and families with children. âThe Romney plan isnât the answer to child poverty and family financial insecurity, but it is an answer, and its concrete financial support for mothers and children would be a tangible statement of our nationâs moral commitment to young families,â he writes.

US footballer Megan Rapinoe has spoken emotionally about the impact the Roe v Wade overturning will have on her, her teammates and others. At a team news conference in Denver, Colorado, Rapinoe, one of the stars of the US women's national team, said she wanted to talk about football, but the anti-abortion ruling took precedence. This video can not be played Roe v Wade: How sad a day this is - Rapinoe Catherine Lewis, 56, from North Carolina, says she thinks that Fridayâs Supreme Court decision was âcorrect from a constitutional perspectiveâ. âI am always for supporting state's rights and this merely puts the decision back into the individual state's hands to decide what's best for their citizens,â she tells the BBC. Lewis says she is opposed to abortion âbecause I am a firm believer in the sanctity of lifeâ. âIn fact, I just wrote my friend's memoir where she explains that she was glad that her parents chose life for her rather than abortion so that she could live."" One part of her message to those who oppose her view would be to âchallenge them to think outside their political talking points and really dive into the issueâ. âLook at it from a legal perspective and understand what Scotus did by sending the decision back to the states,â she says.    JP Morgan, Levi Strauss and Microsoft are among the major US corporations rushing to protect their employees' access to abortion, covering expenses for those who travel for the procedure. Yesterday's ruling - and the abortion bans now expected in at least 13 states - means that millions of US women will have to drive hundreds of miles to get to the nearest clinic. ""We recognise the impact of the ruling and that we remain committed to providing comprehensive access to quality and affordable care for all of our employees, cast members and their families, including family planning and reproductive care, no matter where they live,"" Disney said in a statement. The pro-choice stance taken by so many US companies, including Apple, Tesla, Yelp, Citigroup, Netflix and Lyft, has already generated some backlash from Republican lawmakers, who have threatened to cancel contracts with companies offering support for abortion. In Texas, a state lawmaker has introduced a bill that would prevent companies from doing business with local governments in the state if they provide abortion-related benefits to their employees. Here's a flavour of the demonstrations and celebrations which cascaded across the US in the hours after the highest court in the US reversed the Roe v Wade ruling. More protests have been taking place today, including outside the courthouse in Washington. This video can not be played Protests after US Supreme Court abortion ruling Demonstrators take to the streets after court overturns Roe v Wade ruling. The decision, released on Friday morning, will have repercussions in the US for years to come. With the ruling, the conservative-majority court effectively ended the constitutional right to an abortion. Five justices were in favour: Samuel Alito, Clarence Thomas, Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett. Chief Justice John Roberts wrote a separate opinion saying that he supported an abortion law in Mississippi at the centre of the case but he would not have overturned Roe v Wade. The three other justices disagreed with the majority - Stephen Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kaga. Here are some key passages from the landmark ruling: ""Roe was egregiously wrong from the start. Its reasoning was exceptionally weak, and the decision has had damaging consequences. And far from bringing about a national settlement of the abortion issue, Roe and Casey have enflamed debate and deepened division"" Samuel Alito, writing for the majority, Supreme Court justice ""It is time to heed the Constitution and return the issue of abortion to the peopleâs elected representatives"" Samuel Alito, writing for the majority, Supreme Court justice âThe majority would allow States to ban abortion from conception onward because it does not think forced childbirth at all implicates a womanâs rights to equality and freedom. Todayâs Court, that is, does not think there is anything of constitutional significance attached to a womanâs control of her body and the path of her lifeâ Justices Stephen Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan, in the dissent, Supreme Court justices âWhatever the exact scope of the coming laws, one result of todayâs decision is certain: the curtailment of womenâs rights, and of their status as free and equal citizensâ Justices Stephen Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan, in the dissent, Supreme Court justices Pro-choice protester Guido Reichstadter began climbing the huge Frederick Douglass Memorial Bridge on Friday morning and remains there more than 24 hours later.

Minnesota has joined a handful of other US states, including California, Oregon and Washington, in saying it will ensure women can seek abortion there if they face restrictive laws in their homes states. âMy office has been and will continue to be a firewall against legislation that would reverse reproductive freedom,"" said Minnesota Governor Tim Walz in a statement on Saturday.   President Biden will come under increasing pressure from Democrats to reform - especially to expand - the highest court in the US in the wake of Friday's historic abortion decision. Biden launched a commission in April 2021 to explore possible reforms, but it avoided taking a position in its final report on so-called ""court packing"" by adding justices to the current nine on the bench - though it said it there was no legal obstacle in doing so. Adding more justices to the court could shift the ideological balance of the bench, which currently leans conservative. On Saturday, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre threw cold water on the possibility. She told journalists travelling with the president to a G7 meeting in Europe that expanding the court ""is something that the president does not agree with"". ""That is not something that he wants to do."" She said there was ""no final decision"" she could share on any other proposed reforms, which include possible term limits for justices. Nomia IqbalBBC News, Washington Pro-choice activists are surrounding the few people who are anti-abortion here by the courthouse in Washington DC. One man with a sign âJesus Savesâ shouts that he loves everybody as a group of women gather around him shouting âMy body, my choice!â. He eventually moves away after a few minutes of confrontation and chanting at each other. Police are still stood in front of the heavily secured Supreme Court building. If you're just joining us, or would like a refresher on what's been going on today - here are some of the day's main headlines so far on the day after the US Supreme Court overturned the constitutional right to abortion. Biden's criticism continues- President Joe Biden, who yesterday described the ruling as a ""tragic error"", has spoken out again. After signing a landmark gun control bill into law - the first in decades, but which has been overshadowed by the abortion verdict - Biden was asked whether the court is a broken institution, and replied: ""I think the Supreme Court has made some terrible decisions.""  Demonstrations continue- Abortion-rights supporters have been protesting across the US again, with events planned around the nation over the weekend. Crowds have gathered again outside the Supreme Court building in Washington DC - but pro-life activists are there too. Friday's protests were largely peaceful, though police fired tear gas on protesters in Phoenix, Arizona, and police in riot gear moved to disperse a hard core of protesters in downtown Los Angeles. Global reaction continues- As well as protests in the US, there have been demonstrations in major cities around the world, while international leaders such as Canada's Justin Trudeau, French President Emmanual Macron and New Zealand's Jacinda Ardern have voiced their dismay over the ruling. And female US celebrities from a variety of sectors have spoken of their anger or sadness, including singer Bille Eilish, tennis star Coco Gauff and US soccer icon Megan Rapinoe. Actual changes have started- Several states have already moved to make abortion illegal, with new laws immediately imposed in Arkansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Missouri, Oklahoma, South Dakota and Utah. Abortion clinics have been closing and a senator in Oklahoma told the BBC anyone carrying out an abortion there now could face five years in jail. Teenage US tennis star Coco Gauff says she is disappointed by the US Supreme Court's decision, in a pre-Wimbledon news conference. The 18-year-old has previously used her platform to comment on social issues, andwrote ""Peace - end gun violence"" on a camera lensafter she won the semi-final at the French Open last month. ""Obviously I feel bad for future women and women now, but I also feel bad for those who protested for this, I don't even know how many years ago, but protested for this (and) are alive to see that decision to be reversed,"" Reuters quotes Gauff as saying. She tells reporters in London she feels like ""we're almost going backwards"" and says she's concerned it could lead to the reversal of other things people worked hard to achieve in the past. ""I still want to encourage people to use their voice and not feel too discouraged about this because we can definitely make a change, and hopefully change will happen,"" Gauff adds. Anthony ZurcherBBC North America reporter It's been 50 years since the legality of abortion was determined by votes, so the electoral implications of returning this power to the states are difficult to predict. When abortion rights were protected by Supreme Court precedent, public opinion surveys generally indicated that it was conservatives who were more motivated to vote based on the issue. Democrats, with the status quo on their side, were less inclined to make abortion a top issue. But recent polls suggest that calculus may change now that Roe is gone. According to a CBS News survey in May, 40% of Democrats said they would be more likely to vote if Roe v Wade were overturned, compared to only 17% of Republicans. If Democrats are able to use the abortion issue to energise their base, it could give their hopes of electoral success new life despite a president struggling with low popularity and a challenging economic climate. Control of the US Congress, which could pass legislation protecting or banning abortion nationally, is also up for grabs. Democrats have a slim majority in the House of Representatives and are tied 50-50 in the US Senate, maintaining control only through Vice-President Kamala Harris' tie-breaking vote. Even the slightest shifts in electoral winds in the months before November's votes could have dramatic implications for abortion rights across the US. Â© 2025 BBC.

"This video can not be played Watch: Moments that made this by-election historic This is an important mood-making week for our biggest political parties. Encounters with the electorate always mould the mojo of our political leaders. For when you are in the popularity business, the verdict of voters, however geographically piecemeal, can't be ignored. But there can be other catalysts that prompt a smile or a frown, and both the Scottish National Party and Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party each face one of those moments in the coming days too. Six takeaways for Tories from by-election doorsteps Tory chairman quits after by-election losses Starmer hails great result for Labour in Wakefield But let's take a look first at the Conservatives, Labour and the Liberal Democrats. The result in Wakefield in West Yorkshire was less surprising but more important than the one in Devon. Why? Because if Labour are to win a general election they need to take seats, and lots of them, from the Conservatives. The party is pleased that, were themargin of Labour's victory there to be repeated at a general election(a big if, as they acknowledge, as by-elections are not about electing a government), they would have won a majority. They take issue with the election guru Sir John Curtice's analysis. Professor Sir John, of Strathclyde University, said the result implied there was still a question mark about the electorate's enthusiasm for Labour, as opposed to distaste for the Conservatives, given the decline in the Conservative vote was more than twice as big as the rise in the Labour vote. Senior figures point out that plenty assumed when Sir Keir Starmer became Labour leader that such was the electoral mountain the party faced,  he would never himself make it to Downing Street, but instead make it possible for his successor to do so. ""The mantra in the office is we have to be Kinnock and Blair,"" says one source, a reference to Lord Kinnock's rebuilding of the party and Sir Tony's delivery of an election victory. They believe such a victory is now seen as doable. Another source recently described the Starmer project thus far as ""climbing out of the grave"" dug for them by former leader Jeremy Corbyn. Parts one and two of the plan were detoxifying their brand, as they saw it, and portraying the government as inept. They feel they have done both these things. The third stage, which plenty of figures including influential ones in the shadow cabinet are getting impatient to see, is the case for why people should vote Labour. Theinvestigation by Durham Constabulary into alleged Covid law breaking by Sir Keir and his deputy Angela Raynerhas hamstrung that and it won't begin in earnest until - if - they are cleared. Planning is under way for the party conference in the autumn; after last year's focus on internal Labour machinations, this year's will be about their pitch to the country. What, then, of the Liberal Democrats? They, in the words of one, are ""super chipper"" this weekend. Little wonder; a third whopping win against the Conservatives in a by-election a year. Conservatives have been known to privately describe Lib Dems as the 'yellow peril', a backhanded compliment to their by-election savvy, energy and ruthlessness. The coalition years doused their brand in a political poison for many. The antidote of time appears to have washed much of that away. They are still parliamentary tiddlers - 14 MPs out of 650, just 2% of the Commons. Lib Dem leader Ed Davey joined his newest MP Richard Foorde to celebrate his win But they could play an outsized role in the politics of the next few years, injecting fear into the Conservative psyche about their potential capacity to wipe out swathes of Tory MPs. One thing the Lib Dems are irritated by is the grumbles of Conservatives, most notably the Health Secretary Sajid Javid this weekend, about talk of a deal between the Lib Dems and Labour to work together to eject Tory MPs. As Sir John Curtice has said, there appears to be a growing willingness of voters to vote for whichever party locally is best able to beat the Conservatives. Both Labour and the Lib Dems insist there is no deal, there is no pact, it's parties focusing on where they can win. Lib Dem sources also point out they couldn't possibly have won and won so big in three previously rock solid Conservative seats without luring former Tory voters to them, including, especially in Tiverton and Honiton, plenty who voted Leave. Next: the Conservatives. It's 30 years since a party lost two by elections on the same day. The last time it happened, it was the Conservatives again who were on the receiving end of two chunks of the electorate's ire. On 7 November 1991, they lost Kincardine and Deeside to the Liberal Democrats and Langbaurgh in North Yorkshire to Labour. And what happened at the general election six months later? The Conservatives won them both back. The idea that by-elections can be a psephological quirk â and they can be â and exaggerate a party's popularity or otherwise, is what Tories cling to this weekend. Boris Johnson told the BBC a ""psychological transformation"" in his character is ""not going to happen"" But plenty of Boris Johnson's internal critics think the electorate's judgement on the prime minister's character is set and little can change that. His supporters hope his previous bounce-back-ability has at least one more boing in it. Finally, then, to the DUP and the SNP. Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionists are refusing to go into devolved government at Stormont. They say they won't go back into power sharing until the part of the Brexit deal called theNorthern Ireland Protocolis radically altered, removing that sense from many unionists that it was unpicking the stitches that hold the UK together, the overarching fear of their political creed. On Monday, the proposed change in the law that could ditch chunks of the Protocol will be debated in the Commons. Some are outraged at what they see as the government intentionally breaking international law. Ministers insist it won't do that. What we shouldn't expect is rapid movement from the DUP. They feel they've been repeatedly let down by Boris Johnson and they have a mandate to ensure they get the Protocol sorted, as they see it, before returning to Stormont. Second reading of protocol bill set for next week DUP 'in denial' about financial situation in NI Debating the Protocol Bill won't be enough to resolve that impasse. And so to the Scottish National Party. The first thing which always bears repeating is how, 15 years into government at Holyrood, they continue to be the colossus of Scottish politics; everyone else a shrimp in comparison. It doesn't insulate them from problems; their Westminster leader Ian Blackford has faced calls to resign over his party's handling of a sexual harassment complaint. This video can not be played Ian Blackford apologises to victim and says Patrick Grady should ""reflect"" on behaviour Not only has it raised questions about Mr Blackford's judgement in the eyes of his critics, but proven there is at least one mole within his ranks who has recorded and leaked what was meant to be a private meeting. On Tuesday, party leader and Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon will set out how she plans to ""unlock the door to another independence referendum"", as one figure put it to me. Exactly how they do that, with Boris Johnson refusing to countenance one, will be interesting. It'll be a big moment at the core of the SNP's very reason for being - and so itself a mood-maker for them and Scottish politics more broadly.

"A woman passes a polling station on horseback in Uffculme, Devon There has been a resounding double defeat for the Conservatives after the Lib Dems took the south-western rural stronghold of Tiverton and Honiton and Labour made a decisive return to power in the northern seat of Wakefield. Our South West political editorMartyn Oatesand Yorkshire political editorJames Vincenthave been following the candidates and speaking to voters in the two very different communities over the past few weeks. This is what they have learned. 1/ Low wages and high house prices squeezing voters On the face of it, the South West is a typical rural Conservative stronghold - and from the 2015 general election until this by-election electors across the peninsula returned a Conservative MP in all but two constituencies. But Devon and Cornwall also had serious socio-economic problems even before the cost of living crisis hit. Government funding has singled out Cornwall for special treatment. But research by Devon County Council shows this constituency is one of several areas of Devon where productivity per head is equal to or poorer than Cornwall's - without corresponding government recognition. Low wages contrast with soaring house prices. Spiralling fuel prices are a particular concern in highly-rural constituencies like this, where a car is often seen as essential to live and work. Getting the voice of the rural South West heard in Westminster has always been a challenge - and some think that has not become easier with the present government's anxiety to help its new friends in the North. Follow our live coverage of the by-elections fallout 2/ Farmers on collision course with government Agriculture shapes the whole landscape of this constituency, from Exmoor to the Blackdown Hills to the Jurassic Coast. And the government has put itself on a collision course with the farming community in at least three key policy areas. Farmers say they are once again ploughing crops back into the fields because they cannot source enough foreign labour under the government's strict new immigration rules. Livestock farmers - who predominate here - are also extremely worried about the new trade deals ministers have struck with Australia and New Zealand, fearing they will be undercut by a flood of cheap foreign meat. Even the government's own analysis found the agricultural sector would suffer as a result. And the ending of the old EU-style farm subsidies is especially feared somewhere like this where the typically small, family farm has relied on them to stay in business. 3/ Prime minister's personality looms large Boris Johnson's barnstorming celebrity status and his unconventional approach to high office always risked being a double-edged sword, though many saw it as the trump card which won the Conservatives their huge majority in 2019. Two-and-half years into his premiership and with the partygate row and the confidence vote fresh in voter's minds, the PM's personality loomed perhaps unusually large in this by-election. The candidates for the three big parties all brandished impressive local credentials.  But another local - the ex-MP whose resignation triggered this by-election - was arguably the other big political personality here, albeit one with no active involvement. The enduring affection for Neil Parish, a farmer himself and widely credited for working hard for this farming community, is perhaps a reminder that strong local candidates can also help make or break the political weather. FollowMartyn on Twitter,external 1/ Fans don't back beleaguered clubs Many people in Wakefield are Leeds United fans. They will always support Leeds, but might not go to games if the team is not doing very well. That's potentially what happened here with the Conservatives. People who are natural Conservative voters may have just stayed at home rather than voting. The low turnout did them no favours and just like fans of a beleaguered club they perhaps showed their views by not showing them at all. For football clubs, the way they get out of that rut is by changing the manager. 2/ Prime minister's no-show may have had an impact Maybe leader visits do matter in election campaigns. Sir Keir Starmer was in Wakefield a number of times. Boris Johnson was due last week - but went to Ukraine instead. As usual, you can read this both ways. Maybe the Conservatives did not want the PM in front of microphones at difficult times. But it also might have looked like they were not taking the by-election here seriously. Also, those nearby MPs that backed the PM in the confidence vote, did so in part because he was seen as a vote winner. He helped get some MPs their first-ever job in Westminster. But in Yorkshire today, he's not a vote winner. Will he ever come to Yorkshire as PM again? 3/ Are voters in the North returning to Labour? Labour can take back ""red wall"" seats. I mean, no-one here calls it the red wall, but Labour thinks they can grab them back. The Conservatives think this election was called for such a specific reason it proves nothing. Labour were favourites, but the big question was how big they could win. A narrow victory could potentially have been shrugged off by the Conservatives and seen as Labour voters not taking to Sir Keir. Nearly 5,000 is big enough for Labour to see it as evidence people are coming back to them. But there is a big difference between a by-election and a general election.

"US President Joe Biden says ""the Supreme Court has made some terrible decisions"", the day after it ended the constitutional right to abortion Demonstrators are taking to the streets again - crowds have gathered outside the Supreme Court building in Washington DC Dozens of protests are planned around the US over the weekend by pro-choice activists But anti-abortion campaigners have been celebrating after the court reversed its 50-year-old Roe v Wade decision Some states have vowed to become ""safe havens"" for women seeking abortions but about half are likely to introduce new restrictions or bans And 13 have so-called trigger laws in place that will see abortion quickly banned - some clinics have begun shutting down already Edited by Tom Geoghegan Thank you for following the day's events with us. There was a second day of protests across the US in the wake of the historic Supreme Court decision that ended the constitutional right to abortion. US President Joe Biden criticised the court again on Saturday, saying it  ""has made some terrible decisions"". Thirteen states have so-called trigger laws in place that will see abortion quickly banned - some clinics begun shutting down immediately after the ruling. Contributors to the page today were Tom Geoghegan, Holly Honderich, Jessica Murphy, Sam Cabral, James Clarke, Nathan Williams and Robin Levinson-King. Shortly after the Supreme Court decision on Friday, President Biden urged pro-choice Americans to head to the polls and elect politicians who support abortion rights. Democrats will seek to use the abortion issue to energise their base, and for some voters, ensuring Democrats control Congress could take on fresh urgency. Biden is also likely to come under increasing pressure to reform the Supreme Court. Individual states, including Minnesota, Washington, Oregon, and California, and cities like New York, have vowed to offer reproductive care to women living in states where abortion is banned. Campaigners have also been putting in place efforts to ensure women travelling from out-of-state have access to support - and the financial funds - needed to access abortion services. At a state level, new laws restricting abortion are already being challenged. Planned Parenthood in Utah filed a lawsuit on Saturday challenging the constitutionality of the stateâs abortion ban. And earlier this month, a synagogue in Florida sued the state, arguing a law that will ban most abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy as of 1 July, violates religious freedoms. Pro-choice campaigners are also seeking to improve access to abortion medication, especially in states where abortion is heavily restricted. Medication was used in just over 50% of abortions in the US in 2020, according to data from the Guttmacher Institute, which supports abortion rights.   Protesters don Handmaid's Tale costumes to protest about the nomination of conservative Justice Amy Coney Barrett In Margaret Atwood's 1985 novel The Handmaid's Tale - now a hit TV series - she imagined a fictional American dystopia. Writing in The Atlantic, she says the US Supreme Court has brought Gilead to life. ""In the fictional theocracy of Gilead, women had very few rights, as in 17th Century New England. The Bible was cherry-picked, with the cherries being interpreted literally. Although I eventually completed this novel and called it The Handmaidâs Tale, I stopped writing it several times, because I considered it too far-fetched. Silly me. The Alito opinion purports to be based on Americaâs Constitution. But it relies on English jurisprudence from the 17th Century, a time when a belief in witchcraft caused the death of many innocent people.

Read more:The woman who helped topple Roe The crowds gathered again on Saturday but not in the same numbers A pro-choice protester outside the court Two demonstrators stand off Protesters take a break from the June heat Planned Parenthood Association of Utah and the American Civil Liberties Union of Utah have filed a lawsuit against a state law banning all abortions. Utah is one of the states that moved to immediately ban abortion after Friday's Supreme Court decision. The lawsuit, filed on Saturday, argues that Utah's abortion ban violates the state's constitution and asks for a restraining order to block it from being enforced. Utah's so-called ""trigger law"" bans abortion in the state, expect in rare cases, including verifiable rape or incest and where the mother's life is at risk or if the pregnancy poses a threat of ""substantial and irreversible impairment of a major bodily functionâ.  Friday's Supreme Court decision was decades in the making, and a major victory for the anti-abortion campaigners in the United States. So after overturning the 50-year-old Roe v Wade - the landmark US ruling that made abortion a constitutional right - what comes next for the movement? Many see overturning Roe v Wade as just the beginning of its work. Some of the battle will now move to the state level, since the ruling means individual states are free to set their own rules. Carol Tobias, President of National Right to Life, has said overturning Roe means campaigners will now move to âencourage as many states as possible to ban abortion to whatever extent they canâ. Others, including the Susan B Anthony List, which supports anti-abortion politicians, have called on increasing efforts to financially support families and new mothers. In the Atlantic,,externalconservative Christian and commentator David French points to policies like Senator Mitt Romneyâs proposed Family Security Act, which would offer monthly financial assistance to expecting mothers and families with children. âThe Romney plan isnât the answer to child poverty and family financial insecurity, but it is an answer, and its concrete financial support for mothers and children would be a tangible statement of our nationâs moral commitment to young families,â he writes.

JP Morgan, Levi Strauss and Microsoft are among the major US corporations rushing to protect their employees' access to abortion, covering expenses for those who travel for the procedure.

More protests have been taking place today, including outside the courthouse in Washington. This video can not be played Protests after US Supreme Court abortion ruling Demonstrators take to the streets after court overturns Roe v Wade ruling. The decision, released on Friday morning, will have repercussions in the US for years to come. With the ruling, the conservative-majority court effectively ended the constitutional right to an abortion. Five justices were in favour: Samuel Alito, Clarence Thomas, Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett. Chief Justice John Roberts wrote a separate opinion saying that he supported an abortion law in Mississippi at the centre of the case but he would not have overturned Roe v Wade. The three other justices disagreed with the majority - Stephen Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kaga. Here are some key passages from the landmark ruling: ""Roe was egregiously wrong from the start.

President Biden will come under increasing pressure from Democrats to reform - especially to expand - the highest court in the US in the wake of Friday's historic abortion decision. Biden launched a commission in April 2021 to explore possible reforms, but it avoided taking a position in its final report on so-called ""court packing"" by adding justices to the current nine on the bench - though it said it there was no legal obstacle in doing so. Adding more justices to the court could shift the ideological balance of the bench, which currently leans conservative.

She told journalists travelling with the president to a G7 meeting in Europe that expanding the court ""is something that the president does not agree with"".

Nomia IqbalBBC News, Washington Pro-choice activists are surrounding the few people who are anti-abortion here by the courthouse in Washington DC. One man with a sign âJesus Savesâ shouts that he loves everybody as a group of women gather around him shouting âMy body, my choice!â. He eventually moves away after a few minutes of confrontation and chanting at each other. Police are still stood in front of the heavily secured Supreme Court building. If you're just joining us, or would like a refresher on what's been going on today - here are some of the day's main headlines so far on the day after the US Supreme Court overturned the constitutional right to abortion. Biden's criticism continues- President Joe Biden, who yesterday described the ruling as a ""tragic error"", has spoken out again. After signing a landmark gun control bill into law - the first in decades, but which has been overshadowed by the abortion verdict - Biden was asked whether the court is a broken institution, and replied: ""I think the Supreme Court has made some terrible decisions.""  Demonstrations continue- Abortion-rights supporters have been protesting across the US again, with events planned around the nation over the weekend. Crowds have gathered again outside the Supreme Court building in Washington DC - but pro-life activists are there too. Friday's protests were largely peaceful, though police fired tear gas on protesters in Phoenix, Arizona, and police in riot gear moved to disperse a hard core of protesters in downtown Los Angeles. Global reaction continues- As well as protests in the US, there have been demonstrations in major cities around the world, while international leaders such as Canada's Justin Trudeau, French President Emmanual Macron and New Zealand's Jacinda Ardern have voiced their dismay over the ruling. And female US celebrities from a variety of sectors have spoken of their anger or sadness, including singer Bille Eilish, tennis star Coco Gauff and US soccer icon Megan Rapinoe. Actual changes have started- Several states have already moved to make abortion illegal, with new laws immediately imposed in Arkansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Missouri, Oklahoma, South Dakota and Utah. Abortion clinics have been closing and a senator in Oklahoma told the BBC anyone carrying out an abortion there now could face five years in jail. Teenage US tennis star Coco Gauff says she is disappointed by the US Supreme Court's decision, in a pre-Wimbledon news conference. The 18-year-old has previously used her platform to comment on social issues, andwrote ""Peace - end gun violence"" on a camera lensafter she won the semi-final at the French Open last month. ""Obviously I feel bad for future women and women now, but I also feel bad for those who protested for this, I don't even know how many years ago, but protested for this (and) are alive to see that decision to be reversed,"" Reuters quotes Gauff as saying. She tells reporters in London she feels like ""we're almost going backwards"" and says she's concerned it could lead to the reversal of other things people worked hard to achieve in the past. ""I still want to encourage people to use their voice and not feel too discouraged about this because we can definitely make a change, and hopefully change will happen,"" Gauff adds. Anthony ZurcherBBC North America reporter It's been 50 years since the legality of abortion was determined by votes, so the electoral implications of returning this power to the states are difficult to predict. When abortion rights were protected by Supreme Court precedent, public opinion surveys generally indicated that it was conservatives who were more motivated to vote based on the issue. Democrats, with the status quo on their side, were less inclined to make abortion a top issue. But recent polls suggest that calculus may change now that Roe is gone. According to a CBS News survey in May, 40% of Democrats said they would be more likely to vote if Roe v Wade were overturned, compared to only 17% of Republicans. If Democrats are able to use the abortion issue to energise their base, it could give their hopes of electoral success new life despite a president struggling with low popularity and a challenging economic climate. Control of the US Congress, which could pass legislation protecting or banning abortion nationally, is also up for grabs. Democrats have a slim majority in the House of Representatives and are tied 50-50 in the US Senate, maintaining control only through Vice-President Kamala Harris' tie-breaking vote. Even the slightest shifts in electoral winds in the months before November's votes could have dramatic implications for abortion rights across the US. Â© 2025 BBC.

"US President Joe Biden says ""the Supreme Court has made some terrible decisions"", the day after it ended the constitutional right to abortion Demonstrators are taking to the streets again - crowds have gathered outside the Supreme Court building in Washington DC Dozens of protests are planned around the US over the weekend by pro-choice activists But anti-abortion campaigners have been celebrating after the court reversed its 50-year-old Roe v Wade decision Some states have vowed to become ""safe havens"" for women seeking abortions but about half are likely to introduce new restrictions or bans And 13 have so-called trigger laws in place that will see abortion quickly banned - some clinics have begun shutting down already Edited by Tom Geoghegan Thank you for following the day's events with us. There was a second day of protests across the US in the wake of the historic Supreme Court decision that ended the constitutional right to abortion. US President Joe Biden criticised the court again on Saturday, saying it  ""has made some terrible decisions"". Thirteen states have so-called trigger laws in place that will see abortion quickly banned - some clinics begun shutting down immediately after the ruling. Contributors to the page today were Tom Geoghegan, Holly Honderich, Jessica Murphy, Sam Cabral, James Clarke, Nathan Williams and Robin Levinson-King. Shortly after the Supreme Court decision on Friday, President Biden urged pro-choice Americans to head to the polls and elect politicians who support abortion rights. Democrats will seek to use the abortion issue to energise their base, and for some voters, ensuring Democrats control Congress could take on fresh urgency. Biden is also likely to come under increasing pressure to reform the Supreme Court. Individual states, including Minnesota, Washington, Oregon, and California, and cities like New York, have vowed to offer reproductive care to women living in states where abortion is banned. Campaigners have also been putting in place efforts to ensure women travelling from out-of-state have access to support - and the financial funds - needed to access abortion services. At a state level, new laws restricting abortion are already being challenged. Planned Parenthood in Utah filed a lawsuit on Saturday challenging the constitutionality of the stateâs abortion ban. And earlier this month, a synagogue in Florida sued the state, arguing a law that will ban most abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy as of 1 July, violates religious freedoms. Pro-choice campaigners are also seeking to improve access to abortion medication, especially in states where abortion is heavily restricted. Medication was used in just over 50% of abortions in the US in 2020, according to data from the Guttmacher Institute, which supports abortion rights.   Protesters don Handmaid's Tale costumes to protest about the nomination of conservative Justice Amy Coney Barrett In Margaret Atwood's 1985 novel The Handmaid's Tale - now a hit TV series - she imagined a fictional American dystopia. Writing in The Atlantic, she says the US Supreme Court has brought Gilead to life. ""In the fictional theocracy of Gilead, women had very few rights, as in 17th Century New England. The Bible was cherry-picked, with the cherries being interpreted literally. Although I eventually completed this novel and called it The Handmaidâs Tale, I stopped writing it several times, because I considered it too far-fetched. Silly me. The Alito opinion purports to be based on Americaâs Constitution. But it relies on English jurisprudence from the 17th Century, a time when a belief in witchcraft caused the death of many innocent people.

"The proposals fall far short of what many Democrats and activists have called for The US Congress has passed a gun control bill - the most significant firearms legislation in nearly 30 years. It imposes tougher checks on young buyers and encourages states to remove guns from people considered a threat. The measures enjoyed bipartisan support, with 14 Republicans joining Democrats in the House to approve the bill by 234 to 193 votes. The bill is now headed to President Joe Biden to be signed into law. On Thursday, the bill also passed in the Senate, with 15 Republican Senators voting alongside their Democratic colleagues in favour of the bill. It ultimately passed in a late-night 65-33 vote. ""After 28 years of inaction, bipartisan members of Congress came together to heed the call of families across the country and passed legislation to address the scourge of gun violence in our communities,"" Mr Biden said on Thursday. The bill came after mass shootings last month at a supermarket in Buffalo, New York, and a primary school in Uvalde, Texas, that left 31 people dead. The reforms include: Tougher background checks for buyers younger than 21 $15bn (Â£12.2bn) in federal funding for mental health programs and school security upgrades Funding to encourage states to implement ""red flag"" laws to remove firearms from people considered a threat Closing the so-called ""boyfriend loophole"" by blocking gun sales to those convicted of abusing unmarried intimate partners President Biden has pushed for bigger reforms - including a ban on assault weapons, which were used in the Texas and Buffalo mass shootings - or at least an increase in the age at which they can be purchased. The gunman in the Texas shooting is believed to have purchased two semi-automatic rifles days after turning 18. The bill is also significant because it is the first time in decades that proposed reforms have received this level of support from both Democrats and Republicans. Historically, efforts to strengthen US gun laws have been blocked by the Republican party. Where does US gun control go from here? US gun control claims fact-checked America's gun culture - in seven charts In the Senate, all 50 Democrats, including the party's most conservative members, Senators Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema, voted for the bill. They were joined by deal-making Republicans, including the party's Senate Leader Mitch McConnell and Lindsey Graham, who is a close ally of former President Donald Trump and a traditional opponent of gun-control legislation. Texas Senator John Cornyn became a leading Republican voice for a compromise deal in the wake of the Uvalde shooting However, two-thirds of Senate Republicans opposed the legislation, and all of those who backed it - except for Alaska's Lisa Murkowski and Indiana's Todd Young - will not face voters in November this year or have announced their intention not to seek re-election. Texas Senator Ted Cruz, who is widely tipped to seek the Republican presidential nomination in 2024,Â condemned the bill as an attempt to ""try to disarm law-abiding citizens rather than take serious measures to protect our children"".Â Among the 14 Republican House Representatives to vote for the bill were Wyoming's Liz Cheney and Illinois' Adam Kinzinger. Gun safety group March For Our Lives - founded by survivors of the 2018 Parkland school shooting in Florida - welcomed the advancement of the bill. ""We know there's A LOT more work to be done to end this epidemic. But a lot of hard work got us to tonight. We refuse to quit or be silenced. Ending gun violence is the fight of our lifetime,"" the group tweeted. The National Rifle Association (NRA) has opposed the bill, and argued that it will not stop the violence. There are an estimated 393 million firearms currently in the US. It has the highest rate of firearms deaths among the world's wealthy nations - more than 20,900 people have been killed in gun violence in the US this year, including through homicide and suicide, according to Gun Violence Archive, a non-profit research group. But it is also a country where many cherish gun rights that are protected by the Constitution's Second Amendment to ""keep and bear arms"". The last significant federal gun control legislation was passed in 1994, banning the manufacture for civilian use of assault rifles and large capacity magazines - but it expired a decade later. On Thursday, the Supreme Courtstruck down a New York law restricting who can legally carry a gun- effectively expanding gun rights. Although polls indicate a majority of Americans support gun control efforts, many Republican senators represent states with large pro-gun communities. And the Republican voters whose support they need to win primary elections - the selection process within each party - are even more opposed to reform.

"Two Tory MPs who have been critical of Boris Johnson say they may stand for election to the committee which runs the party's leadership elections. The move follows the party losing by-elections at Tiverton and Honiton and Wakefield to the Lib Dems and Labour. Following the results, party chairman Oliver Dowden resigned, saying ""someone must take responsibility"". Mr Johnson has admitted the results were not ""brilliant"" but vowed to ""listen and learn"". The prime minister survived a vote of no confidence in his leadership earlier this month, although 148 of his MPs voted to oust him. Under the rules of the 1922 committee of backbench Conservative MPs, Mr Johnson is safe from a further challenge for a year. But Andrew Bridgen, MP for North West Leicestershire, has said he is minded to throw his hat into the ring and stand for election to the committee's executive, saying he would ""be in favour of rule change and effectively that would be another vote of confidence"". ""The sooner the better. We will only probably have one week left before summer recess and I think we should seriously consider having another vote,"" he told the BBC. Steve Baker, MP for Wycombe in Buckinghamshire, also said he hoped colleagues would ""consider allowing him to serve"" although he would not comment on changing the rules. Johnson admits by-election losses 'not brilliant' Tory chairman quits after by-election losses Ex-Tory leader calls for Boris Johnson to go Following the by-election defeats Mr Johnson said he would focus on ""delivering for the people of this country"". Speaking on Friday, the prime minister said he expected critics to continue to ""attack him"" and he ""had to take that"". However, he added he would ""get on with the job of delivering for the people of this country"". Speaking during a Commonwealth leaders summit in Rwanda, Mr Johnson said there would be ""tough times ahead"" and people would ""continue to beat me up"". ""In the end, voters, journalists, they have no-one else to make their complaints to, I have to take that,"" the prime minister told reporters. Conservative MP Andrew Bridgen said he would be in favour of another vote of confidence The two by-election defeats prompted Conservative Party chair Oliver Dowden to quit saying: ""We cannot carry on with business as usual."" Mr Dowden said in a letter to the prime minister that supporters were ""distressed and disappointed by recent events and I share their feelings"". ""Somebody must take responsibility and I have concluded that, in these circumstances, it would not be right for me to remain in office,"" Mr Dowden said. Former Conservative leader Michael Howard said that the party and the country would be ""better off"" under new leadership. Lord Howard said cabinet ministers should consider resigning and that party rules should be changed to allow for a new confidence vote in the prime minister. Cabinet ministers including Culture Secretary Nadine Dorries and Deputy Prime Minister Dominic Raab have given Mr Johnson their backing. Asked if he had full confidence in the prime minister's ability to win the next election, Health Secretary Sajid Javid said: ""Boris Johnson is our leader, is the PM and he will be taking us into the next election.""

"US President Joe Biden says ""the Supreme Court has made some terrible decisions"", the day after it ended the constitutional right to abortion Demonstrators are taking to the streets again - crowds have gathered outside the Supreme Court building in Washington DC Dozens of protests are planned around the US over the weekend by pro-choice activists But anti-abortion campaigners have been celebrating after the court reversed its 50-year-old Roe v Wade decision Some states have vowed to become ""safe havens"" for women seeking abortions but about half are likely to introduce new restrictions or bans And 13 have so-called trigger laws in place that will see abortion quickly banned - some clinics have begun shutting down already Edited by Tom Geoghegan Thank you for following the day's events with us. There was a second day of protests across the US in the wake of the historic Supreme Court decision that ended the constitutional right to abortion. US President Joe Biden criticised the court again on Saturday, saying it  ""has made some terrible decisions"". Thirteen states have so-called trigger laws in place that will see abortion quickly banned - some clinics begun shutting down immediately after the ruling. Contributors to the page today were Tom Geoghegan, Holly Honderich, Jessica Murphy, Sam Cabral, James Clarke, Nathan Williams and Robin Levinson-King. Shortly after the Supreme Court decision on Friday, President Biden urged pro-choice Americans to head to the polls and elect politicians who support abortion rights. Democrats will seek to use the abortion issue to energise their base, and for some voters, ensuring Democrats control Congress could take on fresh urgency. Biden is also likely to come under increasing pressure to reform the Supreme Court. Individual states, including Minnesota, Washington, Oregon, and California, and cities like New York, have vowed to offer reproductive care to women living in states where abortion is banned. Campaigners have also been putting in place efforts to ensure women travelling from out-of-state have access to support - and the financial funds - needed to access abortion services. At a state level, new laws restricting abortion are already being challenged. Planned Parenthood in Utah filed a lawsuit on Saturday challenging the constitutionality of the stateâs abortion ban. And earlier this month, a synagogue in Florida sued the state, arguing a law that will ban most abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy as of 1 July, violates religious freedoms. Pro-choice campaigners are also seeking to improve access to abortion medication, especially in states where abortion is heavily restricted. Medication was used in just over 50% of abortions in the US in 2020, according to data from the Guttmacher Institute, which supports abortion rights.   Protesters don Handmaid's Tale costumes to protest about the nomination of conservative Justice Amy Coney Barrett In Margaret Atwood's 1985 novel The Handmaid's Tale - now a hit TV series - she imagined a fictional American dystopia. Writing in The Atlantic, she says the US Supreme Court has brought Gilead to life. ""In the fictional theocracy of Gilead, women had very few rights, as in 17th Century New England. The Bible was cherry-picked, with the cherries being interpreted literally. Although I eventually completed this novel and called it The Handmaidâs Tale, I stopped writing it several times, because I considered it too far-fetched. Silly me. The Alito opinion purports to be based on Americaâs Constitution. But it relies on English jurisprudence from the 17th Century, a time when a belief in witchcraft caused the death of many innocent people. If Justice Alito wants you to be governed by the laws of the 17th Century, you should take a close look at that century. Is that when you want to live?"" Read Atwood's piece here,external Kathleen McClellan from Breaux Bridge, Louisiana, told the BBC she thinks yesterday's ruling is a step forward for America. ""Yesterday I was overjoyed to hear the news that Roe had been overturned. My employer called me as soon as he heard about it and he was extremely grateful also. I went to Mass on my lunch break and the priest was so moved by the Supreme Court decision that he broke into tears during his homily. ""Legislation protecting human life in every stage of development and ability is another humane goal that Americans can now freely enact state by state. My state of Louisiana has chosen to do that and I'm proud of our governor and legislators."" Holly HonderichBBC News, Washington For Mississippi Attorney General Lynn Fitch, this weekend is one of celebration. ""It's a great day for the American people,"" she said. ""Roe v Wade is now behind us."" Fitch can take some personal credit for the ruling. Under her direction, her state asked the Supreme Court to uphold Mississippi's abortion ban and slash Roe v Wade in the process. The case, according to Fitch, was about ""women's empowerment"". Abortion, she said, offered women a false choice - motherhood or career, not both. ""Fifty years ago, for professional women, they wanted you to make a choice. Now you don't have to,"" she said last year. ""You have the option in life to really achieve your dreams, your goals, and you can have those beautiful children as well."" Read more:The woman who helped topple Roe The crowds gathered again on Saturday but not in the same numbers A pro-choice protester outside the court Two demonstrators stand off Protesters take a break from the June heat Planned Parenthood Association of Utah and the American Civil Liberties Union of Utah have filed a lawsuit against a state law banning all abortions. Utah is one of the states that moved to immediately ban abortion after Friday's Supreme Court decision. The lawsuit, filed on Saturday, argues that Utah's abortion ban violates the state's constitution and asks for a restraining order to block it from being enforced. Utah's so-called ""trigger law"" bans abortion in the state, expect in rare cases, including verifiable rape or incest and where the mother's life is at risk or if the pregnancy poses a threat of ""substantial and irreversible impairment of a major bodily functionâ.  Friday's Supreme Court decision was decades in the making, and a major victory for the anti-abortion campaigners in the United States. So after overturning the 50-year-old Roe v Wade - the landmark US ruling that made abortion a constitutional right - what comes next for the movement? Many see overturning Roe v Wade as just the beginning of its work. Some of the battle will now move to the state level, since the ruling means individual states are free to set their own rules. Carol Tobias, President of National Right to Life, has said overturning Roe means campaigners will now move to âencourage as many states as possible to ban abortion to whatever extent they canâ. Others, including the Susan B Anthony List, which supports anti-abortion politicians, have called on increasing efforts to financially support families and new mothers. In the Atlantic,,externalconservative Christian and commentator David French points to policies like Senator Mitt Romneyâs proposed Family Security Act, which would offer monthly financial assistance to expecting mothers and families with children. âThe Romney plan isnât the answer to child poverty and family financial insecurity, but it is an answer, and its concrete financial support for mothers and children would be a tangible statement of our nationâs moral commitment to young families,â he writes.

US footballer Megan Rapinoe has spoken emotionally about the impact the Roe v Wade overturning will have on her, her teammates and others. At a team news conference in Denver, Colorado, Rapinoe, one of the stars of the US women's national team, said she wanted to talk about football, but the anti-abortion ruling took precedence. This video can not be played Roe v Wade: How sad a day this is - Rapinoe Catherine Lewis, 56, from North Carolina, says she thinks that Fridayâs Supreme Court decision was âcorrect from a constitutional perspectiveâ. âI am always for supporting state's rights and this merely puts the decision back into the individual state's hands to decide what's best for their citizens,â she tells the BBC. Lewis says she is opposed to abortion âbecause I am a firm believer in the sanctity of lifeâ. âIn fact, I just wrote my friend's memoir where she explains that she was glad that her parents chose life for her rather than abortion so that she could live."" One part of her message to those who oppose her view would be to âchallenge them to think outside their political talking points and really dive into the issueâ. âLook at it from a legal perspective and understand what Scotus did by sending the decision back to the states,â she says.    JP Morgan, Levi Strauss and Microsoft are among the major US corporations rushing to protect their employees' access to abortion, covering expenses for those who travel for the procedure. Yesterday's ruling - and the abortion bans now expected in at least 13 states - means that millions of US women will have to drive hundreds of miles to get to the nearest clinic. ""We recognise the impact of the ruling and that we remain committed to providing comprehensive access to quality and affordable care for all of our employees, cast members and their families, including family planning and reproductive care, no matter where they live,"" Disney said in a statement. The pro-choice stance taken by so many US companies, including Apple, Tesla, Yelp, Citigroup, Netflix and Lyft, has already generated some backlash from Republican lawmakers, who have threatened to cancel contracts with companies offering support for abortion. In Texas, a state lawmaker has introduced a bill that would prevent companies from doing business with local governments in the state if they provide abortion-related benefits to their employees. Here's a flavour of the demonstrations and celebrations which cascaded across the US in the hours after the highest court in the US reversed the Roe v Wade ruling. More protests have been taking place today, including outside the courthouse in Washington. This video can not be played Protests after US Supreme Court abortion ruling Demonstrators take to the streets after court overturns Roe v Wade ruling. The decision, released on Friday morning, will have repercussions in the US for years to come. With the ruling, the conservative-majority court effectively ended the constitutional right to an abortion. Five justices were in favour: Samuel Alito, Clarence Thomas, Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett. Chief Justice John Roberts wrote a separate opinion saying that he supported an abortion law in Mississippi at the centre of the case but he would not have overturned Roe v Wade. The three other justices disagreed with the majority - Stephen Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kaga. Here are some key passages from the landmark ruling: ""Roe was egregiously wrong from the start. Its reasoning was exceptionally weak, and the decision has had damaging consequences. And far from bringing about a national settlement of the abortion issue, Roe and Casey have enflamed debate and deepened division"" Samuel Alito, writing for the majority, Supreme Court justice ""It is time to heed the Constitution and return the issue of abortion to the peopleâs elected representatives"" Samuel Alito, writing for the majority, Supreme Court justice âThe majority would allow States to ban abortion from conception onward because it does not think forced childbirth at all implicates a womanâs rights to equality and freedom. Todayâs Court, that is, does not think there is anything of constitutional significance attached to a womanâs control of her body and the path of her lifeâ Justices Stephen Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan, in the dissent, Supreme Court justices âWhatever the exact scope of the coming laws, one result of todayâs decision is certain: the curtailment of womenâs rights, and of their status as free and equal citizensâ Justices Stephen Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan, in the dissent, Supreme Court justices Pro-choice protester Guido Reichstadter began climbing the huge Frederick Douglass Memorial Bridge on Friday morning and remains there more than 24 hours later. In a post on Twitter, he said he would rather be anywhere else but he feels strongly for abortion rights.

Minnesota has joined a handful of other US states, including California, Oregon and Washington, in saying it will ensure women can seek abortion there if they face restrictive laws in their homes states. âMy office has been and will continue to be a firewall against legislation that would reverse reproductive freedom,"" said Minnesota Governor Tim Walz in a statement on Saturday.   President Biden will come under increasing pressure from Democrats to reform - especially to expand - the highest court in the US in the wake of Friday's historic abortion decision. Biden launched a commission in April 2021 to explore possible reforms, but it avoided taking a position in its final report on so-called ""court packing"" by adding justices to the current nine on the bench - though it said it there was no legal obstacle in doing so. Adding more justices to the court could shift the ideological balance of the bench, which currently leans conservative. On Saturday, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre threw cold water on the possibility. She told journalists travelling with the president to a G7 meeting in Europe that expanding the court ""is something that the president does not agree with"". ""That is not something that he wants to do."" She said there was ""no final decision"" she could share on any other proposed reforms, which include possible term limits for justices. Nomia IqbalBBC News, Washington Pro-choice activists are surrounding the few people who are anti-abortion here by the courthouse in Washington DC. One man with a sign âJesus Savesâ shouts that he loves everybody as a group of women gather around him shouting âMy body, my choice!â. He eventually moves away after a few minutes of confrontation and chanting at each other. Police are still stood in front of the heavily secured Supreme Court building. If you're just joining us, or would like a refresher on what's been going on today - here are some of the day's main headlines so far on the day after the US Supreme Court overturned the constitutional right to abortion. Biden's criticism continues- President Joe Biden, who yesterday described the ruling as a ""tragic error"", has spoken out again. After signing a landmark gun control bill into law - the first in decades, but which has been overshadowed by the abortion verdict - Biden was asked whether the court is a broken institution, and replied: ""I think the Supreme Court has made some terrible decisions.""  Demonstrations continue- Abortion-rights supporters have been protesting across the US again, with events planned around the nation over the weekend. Crowds have gathered again outside the Supreme Court building in Washington DC - but pro-life activists are there too. Friday's protests were largely peaceful, though police fired tear gas on protesters in Phoenix, Arizona, and police in riot gear moved to disperse a hard core of protesters in downtown Los Angeles. Global reaction continues- As well as protests in the US, there have been demonstrations in major cities around the world, while international leaders such as Canada's Justin Trudeau, French President Emmanual Macron and New Zealand's Jacinda Ardern have voiced their dismay over the ruling. And female US celebrities from a variety of sectors have spoken of their anger or sadness, including singer Bille Eilish, tennis star Coco Gauff and US soccer icon Megan Rapinoe. Actual changes have started- Several states have already moved to make abortion illegal, with new laws immediately imposed in Arkansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Missouri, Oklahoma, South Dakota and Utah. Abortion clinics have been closing and a senator in Oklahoma told the BBC anyone carrying out an abortion there now could face five years in jail. Teenage US tennis star Coco Gauff says she is disappointed by the US Supreme Court's decision, in a pre-Wimbledon news conference. The 18-year-old has previously used her platform to comment on social issues, andwrote ""Peace - end gun violence"" on a camera lensafter she won the semi-final at the French Open last month. ""Obviously I feel bad for future women and women now, but I also feel bad for those who protested for this, I don't even know how many years ago, but protested for this (and) are alive to see that decision to be reversed,"" Reuters quotes Gauff as saying. She tells reporters in London she feels like ""we're almost going backwards"" and says she's concerned it could lead to the reversal of other things people worked hard to achieve in the past. ""I still want to encourage people to use their voice and not feel too discouraged about this because we can definitely make a change, and hopefully change will happen,"" Gauff adds. Anthony ZurcherBBC North America reporter It's been 50 years since the legality of abortion was determined by votes, so the electoral implications of returning this power to the states are difficult to predict. When abortion rights were protected by Supreme Court precedent, public opinion surveys generally indicated that it was conservatives who were more motivated to vote based on the issue. Democrats, with the status quo on their side, were less inclined to make abortion a top issue. But recent polls suggest that calculus may change now that Roe is gone. According to a CBS News survey in May, 40% of Democrats said they would be more likely to vote if Roe v Wade were overturned, compared to only 17% of Republicans. If Democrats are able to use the abortion issue to energise their base, it could give their hopes of electoral success new life despite a president struggling with low popularity and a challenging economic climate. Control of the US Congress, which could pass legislation protecting or banning abortion nationally, is also up for grabs. Democrats have a slim majority in the House of Representatives and are tied 50-50 in the US Senate, maintaining control only through Vice-President Kamala Harris' tie-breaking vote. Even the slightest shifts in electoral winds in the months before November's votes could have dramatic implications for abortion rights across the US. Â© 2025 BBC.

One part of her message to those who oppose her view would be to âchallenge them to think outside their political talking points and really dive into the issueâ. âLook at it from a legal perspective and understand what Scotus did by sending the decision back to the states,â she says.    JP Morgan, Levi Strauss and Microsoft are among the major US corporations rushing to protect their employees' access to abortion, covering expenses for those who travel for the procedure. Yesterday's ruling - and the abortion bans now expected in at least 13 states - means that millions of US women will have to drive hundreds of miles to get to the nearest clinic. ""We recognise the impact of the ruling and that we remain committed to providing comprehensive access to quality and affordable care for all of our employees, cast members and their families, including family planning and reproductive care, no matter where they live,"" Disney said in a statement. The pro-choice stance taken by so many US companies, including Apple, Tesla, Yelp, Citigroup, Netflix and Lyft, has already generated some backlash from Republican lawmakers, who have threatened to cancel contracts with companies offering support for abortion. In Texas, a state lawmaker has introduced a bill that would prevent companies from doing business with local governments in the state if they provide abortion-related benefits to their employees. Here's a flavour of the demonstrations and celebrations which cascaded across the US in the hours after the highest court in the US reversed the Roe v Wade ruling. More protests have been taking place today, including outside the courthouse in Washington. This video can not be played Protests after US Supreme Court abortion ruling Demonstrators take to the streets after court overturns Roe v Wade ruling. The decision, released on Friday morning, will have repercussions in the US for years to come. With the ruling, the conservative-majority court effectively ended the constitutional right to an abortion. Five justices were in favour: Samuel Alito, Clarence Thomas, Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett. Chief Justice John Roberts wrote a separate opinion saying that he supported an abortion law in Mississippi at the centre of the case but he would not have overturned Roe v Wade. The three other justices disagreed with the majority - Stephen Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kaga. Here are some key passages from the landmark ruling: ""Roe was egregiously wrong from the start. Its reasoning was exceptionally weak, and the decision has had damaging consequences. And far from bringing about a national settlement of the abortion issue, Roe and Casey have enflamed debate and deepened division"" Samuel Alito, writing for the majority, Supreme Court justice ""It is time to heed the Constitution and return the issue of abortion to the peopleâs elected representatives"" Samuel Alito, writing for the majority, Supreme Court justice âThe majority would allow States to ban abortion from conception onward because it does not think forced childbirth at all implicates a womanâs rights to equality and freedom. Todayâs Court, that is, does not think there is anything of constitutional significance attached to a womanâs control of her body and the path of her lifeâ Justices Stephen Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan, in the dissent, Supreme Court justices âWhatever the exact scope of the coming laws, one result of todayâs decision is certain: the curtailment of womenâs rights, and of their status as free and equal citizensâ Justices Stephen Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan, in the dissent, Supreme Court justices Pro-choice protester Guido Reichstadter began climbing the huge Frederick Douglass Memorial Bridge on Friday morning and remains there more than 24 hours later. In a post on Twitter, he said he would rather be anywhere else but he feels strongly for abortion rights.

Minnesota has joined a handful of other US states, including California, Oregon and Washington, in saying it will ensure women can seek abortion there if they face restrictive laws in their homes states. âMy office has been and will continue to be a firewall against legislation that would reverse reproductive freedom,"" said Minnesota Governor Tim Walz in a statement on Saturday.   President Biden will come under increasing pressure from Democrats to reform - especially to expand - the highest court in the US in the wake of Friday's historic abortion decision. Biden launched a commission in April 2021 to explore possible reforms, but it avoided taking a position in its final report on so-called ""court packing"" by adding justices to the current nine on the bench - though it said it there was no legal obstacle in doing so. Adding more justices to the court could shift the ideological balance of the bench, which currently leans conservative. On Saturday, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre threw cold water on the possibility. She told journalists travelling with the president to a G7 meeting in Europe that expanding the court ""is something that the president does not agree with"". ""That is not something that he wants to do."" She said there was ""no final decision"" she could share on any other proposed reforms, which include possible term limits for justices. Nomia IqbalBBC News, Washington Pro-choice activists are surrounding the few people who are anti-abortion here by the courthouse in Washington DC. One man with a sign âJesus Savesâ shouts that he loves everybody as a group of women gather around him shouting âMy body, my choice!â. He eventually moves away after a few minutes of confrontation and chanting at each other. Police are still stood in front of the heavily secured Supreme Court building. If you're just joining us, or would like a refresher on what's been going on today - here are some of the day's main headlines so far on the day after the US Supreme Court overturned the constitutional right to abortion. Biden's criticism continues- President Joe Biden, who yesterday described the ruling as a ""tragic error"", has spoken out again. After signing a landmark gun control bill into law - the first in decades, but which has been overshadowed by the abortion verdict - Biden was asked whether the court is a broken institution, and replied: ""I think the Supreme Court has made some terrible decisions.""  Demonstrations continue- Abortion-rights supporters have been protesting across the US again, with events planned around the nation over the weekend. Crowds have gathered again outside the Supreme Court building in Washington DC - but pro-life activists are there too. Friday's protests were largely peaceful, though police fired tear gas on protesters in Phoenix, Arizona, and police in riot gear moved to disperse a hard core of protesters in downtown Los Angeles. Global reaction continues- As well as protests in the US, there have been demonstrations in major cities around the world, while international leaders such as Canada's Justin Trudeau, French President Emmanual Macron and New Zealand's Jacinda Ardern have voiced their dismay over the ruling. And female US celebrities from a variety of sectors have spoken of their anger or sadness, including singer Bille Eilish, tennis star Coco Gauff and US soccer icon Megan Rapinoe. Actual changes have started- Several states have already moved to make abortion illegal, with new laws immediately imposed in Arkansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Missouri, Oklahoma, South Dakota and Utah. Abortion clinics have been closing and a senator in Oklahoma told the BBC anyone carrying out an abortion there now could face five years in jail. Teenage US tennis star Coco Gauff says she is disappointed by the US Supreme Court's decision, in a pre-Wimbledon news conference. The 18-year-old has previously used her platform to comment on social issues, andwrote ""Peace - end gun violence"" on a camera lensafter she won the semi-final at the French Open last month. ""Obviously I feel bad for future women and women now, but I also feel bad for those who protested for this, I don't even know how many years ago, but protested for this (and) are alive to see that decision to be reversed,"" Reuters quotes Gauff as saying. She tells reporters in London she feels like ""we're almost going backwards"" and says she's concerned it could lead to the reversal of other things people worked hard to achieve in the past. ""I still want to encourage people to use their voice and not feel too discouraged about this because we can definitely make a change, and hopefully change will happen,"" Gauff adds. Anthony ZurcherBBC North America reporter It's been 50 years since the legality of abortion was determined by votes, so the electoral implications of returning this power to the states are difficult to predict. When abortion rights were protected by Supreme Court precedent, public opinion surveys generally indicated that it was conservatives who were more motivated to vote based on the issue. Democrats, with the status quo on their side, were less inclined to make abortion a top issue. But recent polls suggest that calculus may change now that Roe is gone. According to a CBS News survey in May, 40% of Democrats said they would be more likely to vote if Roe v Wade were overturned, compared to only 17% of Republicans. If Democrats are able to use the abortion issue to energise their base, it could give their hopes of electoral success new life despite a president struggling with low popularity and a challenging economic climate. Control of the US Congress, which could pass legislation protecting or banning abortion nationally, is also up for grabs. Democrats have a slim majority in the House of Representatives and are tied 50-50 in the US Senate, maintaining control only through Vice-President Kamala Harris' tie-breaking vote. Even the slightest shifts in electoral winds in the months before November's votes could have dramatic implications for abortion rights across the US. Â© 2025 BBC.
