"Mark Warburton took Rangers training on Friday Rangers have replaced Mark Warburton as manager with under-20 coach Graeme Murty before Sunday's Scottish Cup tie with Greenock Morton. The Scottish Premiership club say they have accepted the resignations of Warburton, assistant David Weir and head of recruitment, Frank McParland. But Warburton, who took charge in 2015, told BBC Scotland he has not stood down and was unaware of the statement. And the 54-year-old Englishman is consulting his legal team. The BBC has learned that Warburton had contact with Nottingham Forest around 10 days ago and was high on the English Championship club's list of possible managers. However, he was not offered the job and they decided to retain their interim team of Gary Brazil and Jack Lester until the end of the season. Warburton, who had a contract at Ibrox until 2018, had taken Rangers' training on Friday as normal before Sunday's fifth-round tie. He had earlier in the morning defended McParland's record of signings after media criticism of the Glasgow club's recruitment. ""At a meeting with the management team's representative earlier this week, the club were advised that Mr Warburton, Mr Weir and Mr McParland wished to resign their positions and leave the club on condition that Rangers agreed to waive its rights to substantial compensation,"" said Rangers' statement. Who is Graeme Murty? Although born in England, Graeme Murty qualified to play for Scotland and won four caps between 2004 and 2007 The 42-year-old played for York, Reading, Charlton Athletic and Southampton in a career lasting 17 years and 437 games He won the Football League Championship with Reading in 2005/06. He has coached at Southampton and Norwich City, both at youth level Joined Rangers in August 2016 as head development squad coach ""Rangers' agreement to waive compensation would assist the management team to join another club. ""This compensation amount was agreed when Rangers significantly improved Mr Warburton and Mr Weir's financial arrangements before the start of this season. ""The board urgently convened to consider the offer made on behalf of the management team and its ramifications and agreed to accept it and release the trio from the burden of compensation, despite the potential financial cost to the club."" Rangers claim that Warburton's representative attempted to alter the the terms. ""A further board meeting was held this afternoon to discuss this and it was decided not to agree to this additional request but to hold with the original agreement,"" he said. ""Mr Warburton, Mr Weir, and Mr McParland have therefore been notified in writing that their notices of termination have been accepted."" Warburton led Rangers to the Championship title and promotion last season Rangers lie third in the Scottish top flight, but they are a distant 27 points behind city rivals and reigning champions Celtic and their statement went on to suggest that the management team have not reached the targets set. ""The board is very appreciative of the good work previously done by the management team but believes it had no alternative,"" it added. ""Our club must come first and absolute commitment is essential. ""It is important that Rangers has a football management team that wants to be at the club and that the board believes can take the club forward to meet our stated ambition to return to being the number one club in Scotland. ""We are clearly short of where we expected to be at this time."" Analysis: Chris McLaughlin, BBC Scotland senior football reporter Relations between Mark Warburton and the Rangers board have been strained for some time. The manner of the departure could never have been predicted, but the departure itself had been coming. Recent results have been poor, but the former Brentford boss was unhappy with the financial backing he received from owner Dave King - a man who he hasn't spoken to in person, on a one to one basis, for months. For his part, King had grown disillusioned by Warburton's signings and what he perceived to be a lack of progress. It was a relationship well beyond repair. Some will believe Warburton was agitating to get out, others will say the board turned on him. Whatever the truth, it's another mess this club could well do without. Warburton's reign at Ibrox suffered a blow in November, when high-profile summer signing Joey Barton was sacked after a training ground disagreement with team-mate Andy Halliday and the manager following a 5-1 defeat by Celtic. It called into question his signing policy, but Warburton gave another ringing endorsement to McParland, who was with him at Brentford, before Sunday's game. ""I've said time and again - his track record is outstanding,"" he said. ""There would be no shortage of takers for someone of his quality."" Warburton also quoted a former Rangers manager in pointing out the pressures that come with the post. ""Walter Smith said to me that you are never more than two or three games away from a major crisis,"" he said. ""That is life at Rangers. ""That is the nature of it. You just get on with it."" Warburton was in charge of Rangers for 82 games, winning 55, drawing 14 and suffering 13 losses. His 67% win rate was more than Stuart McCall, who took charge at the end of the 2014-15 season, and had a 41% win rate, but less than his predecessor, Ally McCoist, with 72%. BBC Scotland's chief sports writer Tom English Mark Warburton attempted to explain away his team's - or former team's - dreary draw against Ross County by saying a series of random events conspired against his players. It was, he said, football's strange ways that denied them on the day, as if some cosmic force was to blame for the failings rather than his own players and his own management. Warburton's comments were bizarre but nowhere near as surreal as the nonsense that took hold of Rangers on Friday evening as the club said that Warburton was leaving and Warburton said that he wasn't. Rangers have known dysfunction in recent years, but those times are not as distant as some chose to believe. They're just dysfunctional in a different way now. Rudderless, leaking like a sieve and now embarrassed in a way that surely took their supporters back to the dog days of Charles Green and chums. This is a shambles.

"This video can not be played Six Nations 2017: Alun Wyn Jones on what makes Wales v England special Six Nations 2017 on the BBC Dates:4 February-18 MarchFixtures:Available here Coverage:Live across BBC TV, radio and online, with live text commentary and scores from every game on the BBC Sport website and app (full coverage details) Wales welcome England to Cardiff in the Six Nations on Saturday with visiting coach Eddie Jones warning his team to expect all manner of ""shenanigans"" from the hosts. In Saturday's earlier game Ireland travel to Italy determined to bounce back after their opening defeat by Scotland, while on Sunday Vern Cotter's buoyant Scots travel to Paris, where they have not won since 1999. But the undoubted highlight of the weekend is the 130th edition of Wales and England, a fixture that was first played in 1881. This weekend's fixtures Italy v Ireland,Sat 11 Feb, 14:25 GMT - live on BBC Radio 5 live sports extra Wales v England,Sat 11 Feb, 16:50 GMT - live on BBC One, connected TV and online France v Scotland,Sun 12 Feb, 15:00 GMT - live on BBC One, connected TV and online ""You go to the hotel and unless you take steps, players get rung incessantly through the night. Those things happen,"" Jones said. ""You go to the ground and the traffic controller drives slower than the traffic's going to make sure you're late. ""You get to the ground and there's something wrong with your dressing room - there's lights off or the heater's switched off. ""You can't check because they traditionally tell you one thing and something else happens. It happens regularly in South Africa and it happens regularly in Wales."" This video can not be played 'They're a cunning lot, the Welsh': Jones ready for Wales 'shenanigans' Even before Jones aired his concerns the occasion was always likely to be a high-octane affair as, given their long-standing history and neighbourly rivalry, Wales playing England in Cardiff is among the most emotive occasions in world sport. Six Nations week two preview Wales v England is make or break for Howley Follow the Six Nations across the BBC News alerts put you at the centre of the Six Nations The Six Nations heavy artillery ""It's not different water or different air"" - Jones Wales' assistant coach Robin McBryde believes that the fierce rivalry is an inevitable consequence of the shared history and proximity of the two nations. ""We are neighbours, aren't we? I have got two English brothers-in-law,"" he said ""It is that English-Welsh rivalry, and wanting to get the better of your neighbour. It's as simple as that."" England have 60 victories to Wales' 57 in the teams' 129 matches with nine draws. However, Wales have a 60% winning record against England in Cardiff. Jones, whose side have won a national record 15 Tests in a row, has been merrily making mischief since the narrow opening win over France last weekend, suggesting earlier this week that the Welsh are ""a cunning lot"". Saturday's match is the sort of occasion which prompts week-long debates about whether the roof on the Principality Stadium will be open or closed. Wales wanted it closed, to ramp up the noise inside the 72,000-capacity stadium which is renowned for its vertiginous stands and electric atmosphere. England, as the away side, had the final say under Six Nations rules and - having said he was not bothered one way or the other earlier in the week - Jones has opted for it to be left open. While the Australian has been stoking the flames, the hosts have been more circumspect - although Wales defence coach Shaun Edwards was moved to compare Jonesto legendary former Nottingham Forest manager Brian Clough. And despite his barbs the England head coach has not been short of compliments, praising the Principality Stadium's ""amazing atmosphere"". He added: ""How could you not want to play rugby there? ""It is one of the greatest rugby countries in the world, so to play Wales in Cardiff with that sort of atmosphere is one of the great delights of rugby."" Wales have injury worries about winger George North - who is chasing a new record of scoring a try in six championship games in a row - and fly-half Dan Biggar and both will have fitness tests on matchday. This video can not be played Six Nations 2017: Wales' Rob Evans says England is 'just another game' But there is some good news for them, with world class number eight Taulupe Faletau back in action, although he only makes it as far as the bench after injury. England have made two changes from the team that edged past France, with winger Jack Nowell recalled and back rower Jack Clifford handed just his second England start as Jones searches for more ball carrying options. Greig Laidlaw will win his 58th cap in the match against France Scotland have lost nine successive games on French soil since they won36-22 at the Stade de France in 1999,externalon the final weekend of their triumph in the last Five Nations championship. How their forwards match up against a formidably physical French pack could be key to halting that losing run. Scotland flanker Hamish Watson, who weighs in at a relatively lightweight 15st 12lb, says he is confident that he and his team-mates can meet the challenge. ""They are a big pack and will pose us a different threat to Ireland, We know they are going to scrum well and have been concentrating on that,"" he said. ""But it's nothing we can't deal with, so I think it will go well."" France coach Guy Noves believes that counterpart Vern Cotter's work is bearing fruit as he approaches the end of his stint with Scotland. Gregor Townsendwill take over in June. ""We will mainly adapt to the Scottish rugby that you have seen evolve for four years - a game based on commitment, speed, aggression, with players who have gained confidence in a highly organised collective,"" he said. Scotland have made one change with the starting line-up that beat Ireland with John Barclay coming in at blind-side flanker to replace Ryan Wilson, who is out with an elbow infection. Rory Best was successful with all but one of his 12 line-out throws against Scotland Ireland coach Joe Schmidt will make sure his side are at Rome's Stadio Olimpico in plenty of time for the weekend's opening fixture as he feels that their late arrival at Murrayfield last week contributed to their lacklustre start to the match. Ireland, whose team bus turned up about 15 minutes late after its police escort reportedly guided it away from an agreed route, conceded three tries in the first half hour to trail by 16 points. ""I don't think it was apathy, there was a bit of anxiety at not having had the full period to warm up,"" said Schmidt. ""Players get anxious, they get very routine-based and I do think it's a challenge for a professional player that they can be adaptable in different circumstances, so they can still start well and cope."" Schmidt has kept faith with fly-half Paddy Jackson at 10 with Johnny Sexton still returning to fitness after a calf injury picked up playing for Leinster in January. Italy, led by former Ireland international Conor O'Shea, have beaten Ireland four times in 26 meetings,with their latest success coming in 2013.

"One of Germany's most senior banking regulators has warned London that it is likely to lose its role as ""the gateway to Europe"" for vital financial services. Dr Andreas Dombret, executive board member for the German central bank, the Bundesbank, said that even if banking rules were ""equivalent"" between the UK and the rest of the European Union, that was ""miles away from access to the single market"". Mr Dombret's comments were made at a private meeting of German businesses and banks organised by Boston Consulting Group in Frankfurt earlier this week. They give a clear - and rare - insight into Germany's approach as Britain starts the process of leaving the European Union. And that approach is hawkish. ""The current model of using London as a gateway to Europe is likely to end,"" Mr Dombret said at the closed-door event. Mr Dombret made it clear that he did not support a ""confrontational approach"" to future relations between the UK's substantial financial services sector and the EU. But he argued there was ""intense uncertainty"" about how the Brexit negotiations would progress and significant hurdles to overcome. The Bundesbank executive, who is responsible for banking and financial supervision, said he was concerned that the trend towards internationally agreed standards was under pressure. And that Britain might try to become the ""Singapore of Europe"" following Brexit, by cutting taxes and relaxing financial regulations to encourage banks and businesses to invest in the UK. ""Brexit fits into a certain trend we are seeing towards renationalisation,"" he said. ""I strongly believe that this negatively affects the well-being of us all. ""We should therefore invest all our efforts in containing these trends. ""This holds for the private sector as well as for supervisors and policymakers in the EU and the UK. ""Some voices are calling for deregulation after Brexit,"" he continued. ""One such example is the 'financial centre strategy' that is being discussed as a fallback option for the City of London. ""Parts of this recipe are low corporate taxes and loose financial regulation. ""We should not forget that strictly supervised and well-capitalised financial systems are the most successful ones in the long run. ""The EU will not engage in a regulatory race to the bottom."" The Bundesbank regulator took a hawkish view At present, London operates as the financial services capital for the EU. More than a third of all wholesale banking between larger businesses, governments and pension funds takes place in Britain. Nearly 80% of all foreign exchange transactions in the EU are carried out in the UK. The business is valued in trillions of pounds, with billions of pounds being traded every day to insure companies, for example, against interest rate changes, currency fluctuations and inflation risk. If there were significant changes to the present free-trading relationship between Britain and the EU, that could have a major impact on the value of the financial services to the UK and on the one million people employed in the sector. Mr Dombret said it would also have an impact on German businesses which use London as a source of funding. Some banks are hoping that, with the government looking to fully leave the single market, an ""equivalence regime"" can be agreed where the UK and the EU recognise each other's regulatory standards. That would allow cross-border transactions to continue with few regulatory hurdles. But Mr Dombret said that equivalence had ""major drawbacks"" and was not an ""ideal substitute"". ""I am very sceptical about whether equivalence decisions offer a sound footing for banks' long-term location decisions,"" he said. ""Equivalence is miles away from single market access. ""Equivalence decisions are reversible, so banks would be forced to adjust to a new environment in the event that supervisory frameworks are no longer deemed equivalent. ""These lead to the overall conclusion that equivalence decisions are no ideal substitute for passporting [which allows banks in one EU country to operate in another as part of the single market]."" Whatever the arrangements, Mr Dombret said that a ""transition period"" would ease the pressure of change and reduce what he described as the ""earnings risk"". ""Let me say that I expect London to remain an important financial centre,"" Mr Dombret told the audience. ""Nevertheless, I also expect many UK-based market participants to move at least some business units to the EU in order to hedge against all possible outcomes of the negotiations."" One of the biggest EU-focused businesses in the UK is euro-denominated clearing - insurance products called derivatives, which allow companies to protect themselves from movements in currencies, interest rates and inflation. Three-quarters of the multi-trillion-pounds-a-day market is executed in London and a recent report from the accountancy firm EY estimated that nearly 83,000 jobs could be lost in Britain over the next seven years if clearing has to move to an EU member state following Brexit. Mr Dombret said it was difficult to see how euro-clearing could remain in London, as it depended on the ""acceptance of the European Court of Justice"" as the arbiter of the thousands of legal contracts signed between counter-parties, many of which last for years. Britain has made it clear that it does not want to be bound by ECJ judgements once it has left the EU. ""I see strong arguments for having the bulk of the clearing business inside the euro area,"" Mr Dombret said.

"Two parliamentary by-elections, two weeks away. Is Labour a sitting duck in its own heartland territory? A quick road-trip to the West Midlands and the Lake District was enough to conclude that Labour can look forward to a sweaty, and quite possibly a painful night on 23 February. Both seats would normally be considered ""safe"" for Labour. But ""normal"" now seems a long time ago. Stoke voted 70% to 30% to leave the EU. In Copeland the margin was 60% to 40%. That would be enough to give Remain-supporting Labour sleepless nights. Copeland by-election candidates Stoke-on-Trent Central by-election candidates But add to that the fact that, in 2015, UKIP came second in Stoke - 5,000 odd votes behind Labour. Throw in Labour's long term deficit in the polls, which suggests former Labour voters have turned away from Jeremy Corbyn. Then, chat to people in Hanley town centre - in the Stoke-on-Trent Central constituency - before travelling north and doing the same in Whitehaven, the large coastal town in the sprawling, and beautiful, Copeland constituency in the Lake District. If you don't hear enough cause for Labour to fear losing one or both of these seats, you're not listening. In Copeland, the biggest employer by far is the Sellafield nuclear power plant. In Whitehaven, where Sellafield has a large office block, Jeremy Corbyn's past opposition to nuclear power - which has since softened - comes up in almost every conversation. The local grocer - whose family have run Kinsella's since the turn of the last century - told me customer after customer was switching allegiance away from Labour for that reason. Could UKIP leader Paul Nuttall win the party's second seat? That, and the doubts about Mr Corbyn's fitness to lead which have handed him a quite dismal personal rating of minus 40. That's 46 points behind Theresa May who was the only national leader with a positive rating in the survey conducted by Yougov last week. In Stoke, the UK Independence Party's new leader, Paul Nuttall, is standing as a candidate. UKIP has a great deal invested in this fight. It's not clear whether the perception of an outsider parachuting into the seat - a charismatic Scouser seizing his chance in an area with a strong identity of its own - will count against Mr Nuttall and his party. If UKIP fails it will hurt, and suggests the party lost its way when it lost Nigel Farage as leader. So Labour will throw everything into both campaigns. Jeremy Corbyn's visited both, and will visit again. Victory in both seats will buy time and space to try to regain ground, to try to recover from the visible splits which opened up so glaringly during debate and voting on the bill to begin Brexit. But if Labour loses in either or both seats - each of which has been held by the party since 1935 - it means talk of existential crisis for the party.

"It was the decade of The Empire Strikes Back and Michael Jackson's song Beat It. A time when Madonna introduced legions of teenage girls to scrunchies and Jane Fonda made lycra and leg warmers cool. And if you were listening to cassette tapes - there's a good chance it was on the revolutionary Walkman - made by Japanese electronics firm Sony. But not everyone was a fan of this Asian influence. Books like ""Japan as Number One"" made the bestseller list, underscoring the antagonism many Americans felt about the then rising Asian superpower. American president Ronald Reagan in 1985 And US President Ronald Reagan was slamming Japan for not opening its markets enough to US products. ""We sell a car into Japan, and they do things to us that make it impossible to sell cars in Japan, and yet they sell cars into us,"" is the kind of rhetoric you might hear. Except that's not Reagan in 1982. It's Donald Trump in 2017. So are we rewinding back to the 1980s? It's a pertinent question to ask, especially as Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe visits the US to meet newly elected President for some leisurely golf and tough talking. Currency will be a talking point on the tee. Like in the 1980s, the US dollar is stronger than the Japanese yen - making Japanese goods cheaper for American consumers. Japanese car giant Toyota says will invest $10bn in the US over the next five years Then, like now, the industries that were the main sticking points were the auto sector and agriculture. Cars, cows and citrus fruit led to a soaring US trade deficit with Japan, worth almost a fifth of the US's GDP at the time. Today the deficit between the two nations has halved, but when the two leaders meet over the next few days, it is these same three subjects that will likely be the focus of their talks. In the 1980s, Japanese car-makers built factories in the US to ward off criticism that they were unfairly dumping products in American markets. Most recently, Toyota has become a target of Mr Trump's trade rage for building a car plant in Mexico As a result, these days more than six million Japanese cars are sold in the US, with only around one million of them made in Japan. But apparently, that isn't enough. Toyota became a targetof Mr Trump's trade rage recently for building a car plant in Mexico. In response,Toyota said it would invest$10bn in the US over the next five years. But analysts say the tough talk on cars won't end until Tokyo offers up some major concessions elsewhere, in particular on agriculture. To protect its farmers, Japan places an average 14% tariff on all agricultural goods imported into the country. By comparison, the US has a much lower tariff of 5%. If the Trans-Pacific Partnership had gone through, many of Japan's tariffs would have been eliminated. To protect its farmers, Japan places an average 14% tariff on all agricultural goods imported into the country Tariffs on beef for example - the US's top agricultural export to Japan - would have been slashed by 74% within 16 years. Mr Trump effectively killed the TPP by removing the US from it. He will argue that if  Tokyo wants to trade with the US and sell its cars to American consumers, it's going to have to cut tariffs even more aggressively. Mr Trump says that Japan is using monetary policy and intervention to keep the yen weaker against the US dollar, making its goods cheaper in the US. Tokyo has heard this before. In 1985, Japan signed the Plaza Accord - an agreement that eventually saw the yen rise by 46% against the US dollar. Some economists argue that this brought about the ""Lost Decades"" of Japan - an era of low wages and low growth that Japan is still trying to get out of. Tokyo will be wary of any arrangement that will see the yen's value strengthen. Prime Minister Abe may be forced to make some concessions to get the new US president to see his point of view That's especially true at a time when every controversial tweet by President Trump sends investors flocking to the safe-haven yen, making it even harder for Japan to stick to its export-led recovery path. Prime Minister Abe will be under great pains to emphasise to President Trump that Japan today is very different from the 1980s - and that Tokyo shouldn't be a target of his trade rage. There is one thing though that has stayed pretty much the same since then, and that's Japan's dependence on the US. Many of the trade concessions Tokyo made in the 1980s to appease the US were based on geopolitical considerations. Japan wanted continued US military and political support in its backyard. The same, to some extent, is true today. Prime Minister Abe may be forced to make some concessions to get the new US president to see his point of view, even if there's a possibility that Japan Inc gets hurt in the bargain.

"The changes give sweeping new to powers Mr Erdogan A new draft constitution that significantly increases the powers of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has been approved by voters in a referendum. Here, the BBC's Turkey correspondent, Mark Lowen, explains why this was such a bitterly-contested process. In one brawl, a government MP alleged an opponent bit into his leg. In another, a plant pot was hurled across parliament. A microphone was stolen and used as a weapon. An independent MP handcuffed herself to a lectern, sparking another scuffle. The parliamentary debate on changing Turkey's constitution wasn't a mild affair. On the surface, it might seem a proposal that would enjoy cross-party consensus: modernising Turkey's constitution that was drawn up at the behest of the once-omnipotent military after the coup of 1980. But instead it's arguably the most controversial political change in a generation, giving sweeping powers to the country's powerful but divisive President Erdogan. The plan turns Turkey from a parliamentary to a presidential republic. Among the numerous changes: The role of prime minister will be scrapped. The new post of vice president, possibly two or three, will be created. The president becomes the head of the executive, as well as the head of state, and retains ties to a political party. He or she will be given sweeping new powers to appoint ministers, prepare the budget, choose the majority of senior judges and enact certain laws by decree. The president alone will be able to announce a state of emergency and dismiss parliament. Parliament will lose its right to scrutinise ministers or propose an enquiry. However, it will be able to begin impeachment proceedings or investigate the president with a majority vote by MPs. Putting the president on trial would require a two-thirds majority. The number of MPs will increase from 550 to 600. Presidential and parliamentary elections will be held on the same day every five years. The president will be limited to two terms. The government - and, principally, President Erdogan - argue that the reforms streamline decision-making and avoid the unwieldy parliamentary coalitions that have hamstrung Turkey in the past. Since the president is no longer chosen by parliament but now elected directly by the people, goes the argument, he or she should not have to contend with another elected leader (the prime minister) to enact laws. The current system, they say, is holding back Turkey's progress. They even argue that the change could somehow end the extremist attacks that have killed more than 500 people in the past 18 months. Hundreds of people have been killed in attacks in Turkey in the past 18 months A presidential system is all very well in a country with proper checks and balances like the United States, retort critics, where an independent judiciary has shown itself willing to stand up to Donald Trump and a rigorous free press calls him out on contentious policies. But in Turkey, where judicial independence has plummeted and which now ranks 151 of 180 countries in the press freedom index of the watchdog Reporters Without Borders, an all-powerful president would spell the death knell of democracy, they say. Profile: Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Turkey's dominant president 'Open, police!': The day a Turkish writer's life changed Mr Erdogan's opponents already decry his slide to authoritarianism, presiding over the world's biggest jailer of journalists and a country where some 140,000 people have been arrested, dismissed or suspended since the failed coup last year. Granting him virtually unfettered powers, said the main opposition CHP, would ""entrench dictatorship"". Since the failed coup 140,000 people have been arrested, dismissed or suspended from their jobs Ahmet Kasim Han, a political scientist from Kadir Has University, said before the vote: ""It doesn't look as bad as the opposition paints it and it's definitely not as benevolent as the government depicts it. ""The real weakness is that in its hurry to pass the reform, the government hasn't really explained the 2,000 laws that would change. So it doesn't look bright, especially with this government's track record."" How did the referendum come to happen? The governing AK Party had to rely on parliamentary votes from the far-right MHP to lead the country to a referendum. Opposition to the reform was led by the centre-left CHP and the pro-Kurdish HDP parties, the latter of which had been portrayed by the government as linked to terrorism. Several of its MPs and the party leaders are now in prison. Devlet Bahceli, leader of the far right MHP, now supports the proposed constitutional changes AKP and MHP voters who opposed the reform might have felt pressured into voting in favour, so as not to be tarnished as supporting ""terrorists"", especially since the referendum took place under the state of emergency imposed after the attempted coup. ""Holding the vote under this state of emergency makes it susceptible to allegations that people don't feel free to say no,"" says Dr Kasim Han. ""It casts a shadow over the outcome."" With the detail of the constitutional reform impenetrable to many, the referendum became focused around Mr Erdogan himself: a president who elicits utmost reverence from one side of the country and intense hatred from the other. The result will now determine the political fate of this deeply troubled but hugely important country.

"The Local Government Information Unit has warned that lots of local authorities in England are planning to raise council tax next year. The Reality Check team answers five questions about local government funding. In 2012, the government introduced a rule which means that any proposal to increase council tax by 2% or more in England must be put to a local referendum. For the first three years, councils were given a further incentive to avoid council tax rises all together. The government gave ""freeze grants"" to councils that didn't impose any increase - worth the equivalent of a 1% tax rise each year. Those grants have now come to an end. It is also important to realise that councils have faced significant cuts to the overall grants they receive from central government - with further cuts planned for the coming years. However a higher figure of 5%, before a referendum is triggered, has become a factor this time round because of the introduction of the social care precept. In 2015, former chancellor George Osborne announced several policies to provide additional funding for adult social care in response to complaints that the sector was facing a funding crisis. One of the policies was the social care precept. Originally, it would have allowed councils to impose an additional 2% council tax increase each year from 2017 for three years, with the extra money being ring-fenced for adult social care. In other words, it would have increased the threshold for a local referendum from 2% to 4%. In December 2016, the Communities and Local Government Secretary Sajid Javid announced a change to the social care precept. Instead of being able to impose an extra 2% increase for each of the next three years, councils will be able to impose an extra increase of up to 3% in each of the next two years. In other words, the referendum threshold for the next two years is 5%. As before, councils can still only impose an additional 6% in total over the next three years, but the change allows them to front load the cash. It doesn't mean they can make bigger increases overall. A further complicating factor is that the 3% precept doesn't apply to the whole of your council tax bill. The structure of local government in England is complicated. In some places there's just one council that provides all the services. These include unitary authorities such as Hartlepool and Portsmouth, London boroughs among them Hillingdon and Southwark, and metropolitan districts like Liverpool and Wolverhampton. In other places there is a two-tier structure with a district council and a county council, for example, Broadland district makes up part of Norfolk. If you live there you have two councils. Although households receive a single council tax bill, it's actually made up of several different bits. In places with separate county and district councils, each of them charges for the services they provide. Police and crime commissioners, fire and rescue authorities and the Greater London Authority also levy charges through council tax bills. The social care precept only applies to councils that have responsibility for adult social care. That means county councils and unitaries, metropolitan districts and London boroughs. So it is only that part of the bill that can go up by more than 2% without a referendum. Overall, it means that the total increase is limited to a bit below 5% - the precise figure will vary from one place to another. The rules say the basic threshold is ""2% or more"". So a rise of exactly 5%, including the social care precept, would trigger a referendum. For that reason, quite a few councils are planning increases of 4.99%. For those that don't have responsibility for adult social care 1.99% is a common number.

"The claim:The government had committed to taking 3,000 unaccompanied refugee children from Europe, but it will now close the programme after taking in just 350. Reality Check verdict:The government previously referred to a goal to bring 3,000 unaccompanied children to the UK but eventually passed an amendment that did not commit to a specific figure. Immigration Minister Robert Goodwill says the 350 figure meets the ""intention and spirit"" of the Dubs Amendment, but Lord Dubs disagrees. Speaking on the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme, Labour peer Lord Dubs spoke of his disappointment that the government had ""gone back on their word"" on how many unaccompanied asylum-seeking children would be brought to the UK from Europe. The 3,000 figure was originally put forward in a campaign run by charity Save the Children. And in January 2016, the then Immigration Minister, James Brokenshire, said the government would commit to resettling increasing numbers of refugees, most of whom would be children, mentioning the 3,000 figure as a goal but without giving any figure as a commitment. Then, in March 2016, Lord Dubs, who came to the UK himself as a child refugee fleeing the Nazis, tabled an amendment to the Immigration Bill, which would require the UK to take in 3,000 children who had been separated from their families. This had strong support from all opposition parties and a number of Conservative MPs. And it passed in the House of Lords by a significant margin at the end of March. But when it went to the Commons in April, the Conservative government's position was to vote against the amendment, and it was rejected by a narrow margin. It then went back to the House of Lords, where Lord Dubs reworded the amendment to read that the UK should take a ""specified number"" of unaccompanied children from Europe and that this number would be agreed later in discussion with local authorities. This again passed in the Lords with a significant majority. It then went back to the Commons and was expected to go to a vote on 9 May. But, on 4 May, ahead of the vote, Mr Cameron accepted the revised version of the amendment. Nearly a year later, on Wednesday, 8 February 2017, Immigration Minister Robert Goodwill announced that the government would transfer 350 unaccompanied children - about a 10th of the original figure - from refugee camps in Europe, which, he said, would meet the ""intention and spirit"" of Lord Dubs's amendment. Mr Goodwill said this would include about 200 children already brought to the UK under the terms of Lord Dubs's amendment and another 150 still to come. He said that more than 900 children had been brought here from Calais in total in 2016. The 700 brought to the UK but not under the terms of Lord Dubs's amendment were brought here under a different regulation, which allows unaccompanied minors to come to the UK if they already have immediate family here.

"The health secretary said he didn't want to make excuses about very long waiting times in A&E My interview with the Health Secretary Jeremy Huntstruck an interesting note after a day of bleak news from NHS England. Official figures showed the worst performance in A&E units in December since records began in 2004. The number of patients waiting on trolleys for more than four hours because beds were not free rose nearly 50% year on year. Rather than hitting back with a raft of statistics on extra investment by the government, Jeremy Hunt acknowledged that progress had not always lived up to expectations. Mr Hunt accepted the reality of the situation in some of England's hospitals, highlighted by images ofpatients waiting more than 13 hours for bedsanda six-month delay discharging an elderly woman because of care shortcomings. These were ""unacceptable"", he said, and ""bad for the NHS"". He volunteered that ""it's incredibly frustrating for me"" and he ""didn't want to make excuses"". This sounded like a health secretary who knew only too well that the NHS was under immense strain and there was no denying the real challenges facing staff and patients every day. I repeatedly asked Mr Hunt what he was doing about it. He emphasised the government's long-term moves to get health and social care working together and the ""big transformation programme"" aiming to treat more people in their local community rather than in hospitals. But on the pressures right now in hospitals, Mr Hunt had little new to say apart from noting that some were a lot better than others at managing the flow of patients. So what can the government do? Ministers are now focused on social care, where successive spending cuts have made it harder to look after the frail elderly at home.  Mr Hunt told me the government recognised there was a problem and it was being addressed. All roads for a move on social care now lead to the Budget on 8 March. Rumours that the Chancellor, Philip Hammond, will announce a new financial package on social care have been rife in Whitehall. The sudden scrapping of Surrey County Council's referendum on a 15% council tax rise fuelled suspicions that its leader had been quietly tipped off about an impending announcement on social care funding. Intriguingly, when I asked the health secretary about what might happen in the Budget he said that was up to the prime minister and the chancellor. It sounded like a plea to Downing Street to come up with new money for social care. Mr Hunt added, though, that a quick fix on its own was not enough and that a long-term answer was needed as well. There is a danger in building up expectations which cannot be met on Budget Day. But it feels like the health secretary and other ministers are resting their hopes on the chancellor. There is not much they can do about this winter's A&E pressures except to wait and hope. Most worryingly for the health secretary is the knowledge that this was supposed to be the ""year of plenty"" for NHS England with a ""frontloaded"" financial settlement. Even with a relatively generous allocation for this year, the hospital system is in trouble. Mr Hunt knows that funding in the next couple of years will tail off. He will hope that promised and planned efficiency savings start to materialise soon. An intervention by his former adviser, the American health guru Don Berwick, has lent weight to calls for more funding for the NHS. In a BBC interview, Mr Berwick, commenting on the government's current financial plans for health, said: ""I have serious doubts whether you can have a healthcare which is universal, not rationed and responsive to needs at that target level - I am concerned."" He may also be alarmed that even with intense winter preparations in each area of England between local health and local care chiefs, some A&E units have struggled under the weight of patient numbers. There were orders from on high for routine operations to be cancelled for four weeks but, even so, many hospitals had very few spare beds. Understandably, Mr Hunt stressed that the NHS was not alone in experiencing pressures of rising patient numbers and that French and German hospitals were under strain this winter. But he knows he will be judged only on the performance of the NHS. He will hope the chancellor has something to offer.

"This video can not be played The BBC's Alex Forsyth travelled to Lebanon to meet some of Syria's refugee children There have been angry recriminations about the UK's apparentscaling back of plans to accept unaccompanied child refugees. Lord Dubs, with all the moral freight and sense of history of a refugee from Nazism, said the government was going back on its own commitments. But is the UK really shirking its international obligations? Figures published this week about aid for Syrian refugees might put the UK government into a less hard-hearted light. One year ago, London hosted amajor international conference to raise humanitarian funds for Syria. There were huge pledges of $12bn (Â£9.6bn) in grants and $40bn (Â£32bn) in loans to help a region struggling with unprecedented numbers of refugees escaping war and persecution. A Syrian child who was part of a group washed ashore in Cyprus this week But after the photo-opportunities and handshakes and ministerial convoys - who actually paid up? The financial report shows that a year later Ireland has paid more than Saudi Arabia and Estonia has donated more than China - not as a proportion of their economies, but in hard cash. In terms of both promises and delivery for funds in 2016, a quartet of donors made up a huge slice of what was supposed to be a global effort. The Syrian war has pushed people across many countries These are the US, Germany, the European Union and the UK - all of which have given more than they initially pledged. The Netherlands, Japan and Norway are the next in this list of donors, but some way behind. According to this annual reckoning, Saudi Arabia pledged $200m (Â£160m) for 2016 and has so far committed to $27.9m (Â£22m). In contrast, Ireland, promised $21.9m (Â£17.6m) for this Middle East conflict and has actually paid up $27.9m (Â£22m). China promised $35m (Â£28m) and so far has delivered $3m (Â£2.4m). This in the end was less than Estonia, a country with a population of 1.3 million, which promised $2.2m (Â£1.76m) but gave a higher sum of $3.2m (Â£2.6m). Canada had been relatively generous in its promise - with a pledge of $71.3m (Â£57.3m). But it proved to be even more forthcoming in practice - delivering $201m (Â£161m), more than any of the Middle Eastern countries making pledges. There might have been a long list of 48 countries and organisations at the London conference pledging support for Syria in 2016, but in practice the fundraising effort has depended on the big contributions from the top four donors. The UK, the smallest donor of this quartet, alone promised $731m (Â£584m) and gave $741m (Â£592m). The next phase of this accounting - for pledges for 2017 to 2020 - gets even sketchier. Refugees from Syria's war now living in Lebanon The EU, the UK, Germany and Norway are the big long-haul donors - but a majority of those who made pledges for 2016 have not promised anything at all for the following years. The world community has promised $6bn (Â£4.8bn) humanitarian aid up to 2020 - but Saudi Arabia and China are among those absent from the donors. And 60% of the total pledges are from the EU, the UK, and Germany. There are a handful of countries who are donating even though they have not made pledges, such as Canada and Ireland. Optimists might take heart from the eventual level of funding for 2016 - where grants have exceeded the original promises by about a third. And of course there are other ways of donating directly or through charities that countries might choose. But so far less than half of the promises at the London conference for 2017 to 2020 have been honoured - and in terms of the loans promised only 31% have been delivered. It's also interesting to look at the detail of who is getting the money. Turkey is the second-biggest recipient in 2016, after Syria. And from 2017 to 2020, the biggest recipient of this ""Syrian"" support will be Turkey by some distance, ahead of Syria, Lebanon, Jordan and Iraq. Turkey is host to the largest number of refugees in the region, with the UNHCR reporting 2.8 million Syrian refugees registered in the country. Gordon Brown warned of ""post-truth economics"" over aid funding Apart from immediate humanitarian aid, a key aim of the fundraising has been to provide an education for all of Syria's refugees - with fears of the damage to a ""lost generation"". Former Prime Minister Gordon Brown, a UN envoy for education, appeared before the International Development Select Committee a couple of weeks ago - and warned about what was at stake. In righteous indignation, he criticised the broken promises that meant many young Syrian refugees had lost their chance of an education along with their homes. He warned that half of all Syrian refugee children were not in a classroom - and many would never enter school at all. When it came to promises of aid, he told MPs: ""There is a post-truth economics as well as a post-truth politics."" And despite the billion-dollar handshakes, he said, world leaders had not come up with the goods. Syrian refugees housed in tents in Greece this winter The price for this lack of education would be paid in increased migration, extremism, poverty and political instability, Mr Brown said. ""Of course, there will always be a battle publicly about how well aid is used,"" he told MPs. ""I will just give you one figure about education that people sometimes forget. ""Take all the aid agencies in the world together, including the Department for International Development, the World Bank, Unesco and Unicef, and the average expenditure per child in low and middle-income countries on education through aid, with all these agencies taken together, is less than $10 (Â£8) per head per year,"" Mr Brown told the select committee. ""This is less than the cost of a textbook, so nobody can say that we are overspending on aid for kids who are desperately in need of educational opportunity.""

"Lost in translation: A video of the pair has been widely shared on social media A tour guide at a Tanzanian game park has been arrested after wrongly translating a tourist's comments about the country and its people. In a widely circulated video clip, the guide says in Swahili that the tourist wants Tanzanians to stop ""complaining"" about hunger. The woman, in fact, says Tanzanians are ""fabulously wonderful"". The guide was arrested on the tourism minister's order for casting the ministry in a ""bad light"", police said. Tanzania markets itself as The Soul of Africa, and is popular with tourists because of its wildlife and spectacular scenery. Africa Live: More updates on this and other stories 'No WhatsApp chats, please' Automated cameras record Serengeti life Worries over new roads in Serengeti The unnamed guide, from the state-run Serengeti National Park in the north, has not been charged with any offence. Regional police commander Jaffari Mohammed told the BBC that he had ""misled"" the tourist, and police were investigating whether he had circulated the video on social media in violation of cybercrime legislation. The controversial law allows for a minimum fine of about $1,300 (Â£1,000) and a minimum jail term of three months for publishing false, deceptive or misleading information on a computer system. The law was introduced in 2015, despite complaints by politicians, social media experts and human rights activists that it gave the police ""too much power"" without adequate oversight. The BBC's Lizzy Masinga in the main city, Dar es Salaam, says some of the guide's words were similar to those used by President John Magufuli, when he called on people at a rally last month to stop complaining about hunger. In excerpts of the videopublished by a Kenyan newspaper,external, the conversation goes: Tourist:""Hi. My visit to Tanzania has been beautiful, gorgeous. The people are fabulously wonderful and friendly. Greetings are always jambo [the Swahili equivalent of Hello]. Happy to be here. The land is beautiful, beautiful. The animals are wonderful."" Guide (translating):""You Tanzanians complain/cry a lot about hunger. Everyday you cry about hunger when you have flowers at home. Why don't you boil the flowers and drink [them]. It is not good to cry/complain about hunger."" Tourist:""The variety of animals and people you see is incredible, unlike anywhere else. It is just fabulous."" Guide:""You are asking your president to cook for you. Do you think your president is a cook? Can you get busy, even boil your clothing and eat."" Tourist:""It will be an experience to savour for all of your life. It is fantastic and beautiful and incredible and just unremarkable. Guide:""Get busy in every corner of the country.

"The star's music is currently withheld from most major streaming services After months of rumour, it has been confirmed Prince's music will become available to stream this weekend. Songs like Purple Rain, Kiss and Little Red Corvette, currently only available on Tidal, will appear on Sunday, ahead of the Grammy Awards. Spotify, the world's biggest streaming platform, told the BBC that all of Prince's albums from 1978 to 1996 would be part of the deal. The BBC understands the music will also arrive on Apple Music and Napster. Prince was the ninth-most successful recording artist of 2016, despite his most famous recordings being withheld from those services, Prince: Sixteen pivotal songs Hunting for Prince's vault Prince, one of the biggest stars of the 1980s, was both a pioneer and a sceptic when it came to putting his music online. In 2001 he began a monthly online subscription service, the NPG Music Club, that earned him a Webby lifetime achievement award in 2006. Organisers said the star ""forever altered the landscape of online musical distribution"" and ""reshaped the relationship between artist and fan"". A day later, he shut the website down. Albums becoming available for streaming include 1999, Purple Rain and Sign O The Times In later years, he aggressively pursued people who put unauthorised clips of his music and performances on YouTube and pulled his music from all streaming sites except Tidal. He wasn't being capricious. Prince was a life-long advocate of artists' rights and would simply pick up his ball and go home when he felt business terms were unfavourable. If he were alive today, it is unlikely his catalogue would be appearing on streaming services. However, his estate potentially owes $100 million (Â£80 million) in taxes, making new business deals a matter of urgency. As well as the streaming announcement, which will be made official on Sunday, Prince's team have arrangedto license his unreleased recordings to Universal Music. The company will be able to exploit his vast archives of live recordings, alternate takes and unheard songs. They also gain the rights to the 25 albums he released after parting ways with Warner Bros in 1996, which include hits like Musicology, 3121 and Emancipation. Paisley Park - Prince's home and recording complex - contains a ""vault"" of unreleased recordings Speaking to Billboard magazine,external, Charles Koppelman and L Londell McMillan - special advisers to Prince's estate - said they had been inundated with requests from people who wanted to honour the star's legacy. ""Whether it's a motion picture, documentaries, Broadway, Cirque du Soleil - all of those are opportunities that I think are in the future for Londell and me and the estate to work on,"" said Koppelman. ""Prince has amazing content beyond the music,"" added McMillan. ""There are [filmed recordings of] the most amazing performances that we haven't even begun to discuss."" McMillan, a music industry lawyer who worked with Prince for 12 years and acted as his manager for some of that time, said he had no intent to disrespect the musician's memory. ""Some people may say. 'Why are you making all these deals? Prince wouldn't make these deals,'"" he said. ""Prince never wanted to lose ownership and control of his creations, so we place ownership and control over dealmaking [in order to] preserve the assets and stay within Prince's brand values. ""As I have told everybody, there's not gonna be a big IRS truck backing up to Paisley Park saying 'I'll take those assets!'""

"Raymond Briggs also created When The Wind Blows and Fungus the Bogeyman Author and illustrator Raymond Briggs, the creator of The Snowman, has been recognised with a lifetime achievement award by the charity BookTrust. A panel of six judges said the award recognised his ""outstanding contribution"" to children's literature. BookTrust paid tribute to the impact his ""captivating and inspiring work"" has had on children and adults alike. Briggs, who also created When The Wind Blows and Fungus the Bogeyman, said it was ""an incredible honour"". ""It's lovely to be given an award for all my life achievements,"" he said. ""Drawing, telling stories and sharing these adventures is something I've always been passionate about. Raymond Briggs designed six Christmas stamps for the Royal Mail in 2004 ""Being awarded the BookTrust Lifetime Achievement Award is an incredible honour and I'm so glad I've been able to make such an impression on people."" In an interview with BBC Radio 4's Today programme, he added: ""It's a bit funny, it being called a lifetime achievement because it implies that you're at the end, you've had your lifetime, we want it tidied up, here's your award, get out."" This video can not be played Raymond Briggs discusses publishing more work and his feelings about Christmas on the Today programme He also said he is not a fan of Christmas, despite being so heavily associated with The Snowman. ""I don't like Christmas at all, I don't think anybody does,"" he said. ""It's full of anxiety, 'Have I got enough, have I spent enough, have I spent so much, we had so and so last year so we have to have so and so this year,' I can't bear it really. I get letters from people all the time saying 'We agree with you'."" Ethel and Ernest was screened on the BBC at Christmas By Will Gompertz, BBC arts editor Raymond Briggs has that gift only relatively few artists possess, which is an ability to produce work that touches people of all ages and backgrounds. Be it The Snowman - now a Christmas perennial - or Ethel and Ernest - the graphic novel charting his parent's life - the characters he portrays are invariably imbued with a soulfulness that makes you, the reader, care deeply about their story. His style as an illustrator and storyteller is understated in tone but bold in approach. Difficult subjects are not ducked; the shade accentuates the light. For each new generation introduced to his Fungus the Bogeyman, or Father Christmas, there lies in store a lifetime of literary and artistic discoveries produced by the unsentimental, but sympathetic hand of Raymond Briggs. Briggs' other most noted works include Father Christmas, Ug, The Bear, Gentleman Jim, and Ethel and Ernest. The panel of judges included children's laureate Chris Riddell, How to Train Your Dragon creator Cressida Cowell and ex-director of the human rights group Liberty, Baroness Chakrabarti.

"NHS staff have been telling Newsbeat why they love their jobs and why they are optimistic about the future of the health service. ""The general consensus is that we are in a massive crisis at the moment,"" says Emily, a 23-year-old medical student who is training to be a doctor. But nurses and trainee doctors we spoke to say it still feels ""worth it"". One student nurse described the ""amazing moment"" a patient she'd cared for came out of a coma. ""One of the most frustrating things about working for the NHS is when you become the face of the NHS to the patient,"" says Grace, a student nurse from Southampton. ""You may be dealing with a situation that is completely beyond your control but you're on the frontline so as far as the patient is aware, you're the one to blame."" She says it's ""hard to focus on your own learning"" when all around you there is a sense of pressure. ""But there are also times where you started treating someone, they're really critically ill, then two months later you watch them walk out of hospital."" ""I've treated a patient before who was in a coma for a couple of weeks and I was on shift when we decided to wake them up. ""It was the most amazing thing to see their eyes open for the first time and to hear their voice, to really get to know the personality behind the person we were treating. Usama, 23, a medical student from Solihull, had a similar experience. ""Just a couple of days ago I saw someone come in with cardiac arrest and you go and check on them, and they're doing fine. Zara, a 20-year-old student nurse from Durham, has been telling Newsbeat how she got into nursing. ""The reason I wanted to go into nursing is that I did volunteer work in a chemotheraphy unit at Sunderland hospital."" ""The nurses I met, the doctors, the healthcare assistants, were amazing and inspirational. They inspired me to be a nurse. ""Even though the pressures of nursing are getting harder and harder, if you've got a real drive and passion to care for people, making them smile, it's so worth it. ""I would be lying if said I was feeling negative about my future career within the NHS. It's all about following a positive action and making sure your career in the NHS in the future is going to be great."" David, 24, from Glasgow, is training to be an occupational therapist in Leeds. ""My family have always worked in the NHS as long as I can remember,"" he tells Newsbeat. He began working in the health service eight years ago, as a domestic assistant in a small hospital in Scotland. ""I decided to go into occupational therapy because I've worked lower down in the NHS and was kind of overwhelmed by the effect a team can have on an individual."" He's preparing for a placement later this year. ""Every week we go through scenarios that OTs might face in the workplace."" ""Personally I'm really excited about my future career in the NHS. I think there are a lot of doors being opened for occupational therapists, especially in the community care aspect of things. Getting patients home is really important to the NHS."" But he concedes it's a ""slightly worrying time"" for staff with constant talk of crisis. ""Privatisation is already going on in the NHS. Private companies are being used by overstretched NHS facilities. ""I think it's a worrying route for the NHS to go down. Where is the line drawn? Before you know it, the NHS is no longer anything like it is at the moment."" Elena, 20, from Reading, is studying children's nursing. ""I decided to go into nursing because I've always liked the idea of looking after people. ""The pressure is quite high but I like the joy of putting a smile on a little child's face - as well as their family. She aims to make the ""whole experience of being in hospital as stress-free as possible"". ""I work alongside the qualified nurses. I can do pretty much everything. I do 12-hour shifts like the normal nurses. ""The hardest bit is when you see a really sick child. You have to be able to detach yourself. You get used to it after a while.""

"Dr Brittain-George said most staff had been attacked or felt unsafe The body set up to advise hospitals on staff safety is to end that work at the end of March, the BBC has discovered. This is despite figures showing almost 200 assaults on doctors, nurses and other NHS staff in England every day. One A&E doctor said ""most NHS staff"" could say they had been attacked or felt unsafe at work. NHS Protect said it could not comment before a staff consultation ended but the government said it believed a new approach was needed to protect staff. The body was tasked with overseeing the measures that trusts were taking to stop physical attacks on doctors and nurses. It has co-ordinated safety standards and held trusts to account since 2003. Dr Jess Brittain-George, who works in accident and emergency, said: ""Most NHS staff can say they've been attacked or felt unsafe at work, especially those of us on the front line. ""Everyone is on alert and looking out for the patient who is going to kick off. ""When I joined as a student in 2008 it was never mentioned.  I did an A&E placement and no-one talked about it. ""Now it's a running joke in the staffroom - 'What's happened to you today? I've been hit again', or something like that."" Kim Sunley was shocked by the number of assaults on NHS staff Dr Brittain-George works in a hospital that takes staff security seriously and has seen attacks decline, but she says elsewhere in the health service security ""isn't stellar"" and has been frustrated by the unwillingness of police officers to investigate. She says a man told an A&E receptionist that he intended to wait outside to kill her when she left work. ""The police didn't care. They said, 'It's just a threat and it isn't important.' But everyone knows that a threat to your life is an offence and it is prosecutable."" Nurses' leaders say the intense pressure on the health service has fuelled attacks on staff. In total, 70,555 NHS staff were assaulted in 2015-16, according to NHS Protect figures - up 4% on the previous year. Kim Sunley, of the Royal College of Nursing, described it as ""an absolutely shocking figure"". ""You see some horrible physical assaults - people being punched in the face, grabbed by the throat, limbs being broken, chairs being thrown at people. ""There's the physical impact of the injury, but also the psychological impact, the long-term effect. People are traumatised. ""Where people are frustrated and are having to wait a long time, an environment that isn't fit for purpose so you have trolleys in corridors, it's going to increase tension, it's going to increase frustration and it's a tinderbox atmosphere."" Many assaults are carried out by people who lack mental capacity, but it is thought some claim mental disability as a way of dissuading the police from investigating. NHS Protect has stepped in to secure convictions in cases when the police have decided not to act. On the issue of ending security work, NHS Protect said in a statement that it was ""not appropriate for us to comment in detail"" before the consultation with staff ended on 1 March. But it confirmed that it was consulting staff about plans under which ""our organisation would not be tasked with security management work"". It added: ""Work continues on the potential of identifying who might be best placed to take the lead on guiding this work, if it is felt appropriate that another body should take it forward"". A Department of Health said its proposals come amid a ""persistently high numbers of these unacceptable incidents"". A spokesperson added: ""NHS staff work incredibly hard in a high-pressure environment, and it is completely unacceptable for them to be subject to aggression or violence. ""Trusts should have no hesitation in involving the police and pressing for the strongest penalties against offenders.""

"It's being claimed""stupid old men""are blocking change at the Football Association. The government has been debating how football needs to evolve and isthreatening to remove fundingif it doesn't reform. We've heard for years that the game needs to become more diverse and criticism that big money is changing it. So we asked four people who think football is broken how they'd fix it. Tyra Ali Ntege is 17 (above) and plays for Crystal Palace youth team. She is also an ambassador for football's equality and inclusion organisation Kick It Out. Tyra thinks the game needs to change dramatically to represent wider society. ""It's simply demonstrated by the FA Council themselves who are comprised mainly of 60-year-old white men. ""I feel the FA Youth Council could be more diverse and increase their representation. ""At the end of the day, you cannot be running an organisation in such a dominating sport and be so far removed from the realities that are happening beneath you. ""You have to embrace change and you have to move forward. ""At the moment I'm witnessing quite a conservative attitude in the FA. The future of football, and where I stand in it, is something that I feel quite hopeless about."" Anthony Smith is the chairman of the LGBT friendly club Birmingham Blaze and he thinks the game needs to have openly gay players at the top of it. ""What I think football needs to do to change from being an old boy's club, is to accept that there are some LGBT players in the professional game. ""At the moment LGBT people are discriminated against in the fact that they can't be themselves at games. ""It needs to change."" Emma Marlow is a goalkeeper at AFC Wimbledon and a coach at the club. She thinks teaching is hard to fit in around a full-time job because some courses take more than ten days to complete. ""I think it's really difficult to get into coaching and I think the FA needs to make it much more accessible,"" she tells Newsbeat. She has other suggestions to get more women involved with the game: ""It needs to publicise the women's game better and put more England games on TV, so that young girls have something to aspire to."" Lee Price stopped supporting Manchester United for lower league Dagenham & Redbridge because he felt that top clubs were letting down fans. Lee likes a close-up selfie ""Clubs are businesses and fans are seen as customers,"" Lee tells Newsbeat. ""As a result, atmosphere's being affected. ""Teams make so much money from from their TV deals, they don't need to charge a single penny for tickets. ""I'd cap all tickets at Â£20 so we don't price out keen customers AKA fans.""

The man with a titanium chest The consequences of arsenic poisoning have been seen most dramatically in Bangladesh, where populations have been exposed to contaminated drinking water. The result has been described as a ""slow burning epidemic"" of cancers, heart disease and developmental problems. Because arsenic exists in soil, small amounts can get into food, though in general these levels are so low that they're not a cause for concern. Rice is grown under flooded conditions, which contributes to arsenic content Rice however, is different from other crops, because it's grown under flooded conditions. This makes the arsenic locked in the soil more readily available, meaning that more can be absorbed into the rice grains. This is why rice contains about 10-20 times more arsenic than other cereal crops.  But are these levels high enough to do us any real harm? ""The only thing I can really equate it to is smoking,"" says Prof Andy Meharg of Queen's University Belfast, who has been studying arsenic for decades. ""If you take one or two cigarettes per day, your risks are going to be a lot less than if you're smoking 30 or 40 cigarettes a day. It's dose-dependent - the more you eat, the higher your risk is."" He believes that the current legislation isn't strict enough, and that more needs to be done to protect those who eat a lot of rice. Eating a couple of portions of rice a week isn't putting an adult like me at high risk, but Prof Meharg is concerned about children and babies. Testing rice for arsenic levels ""We know that low levels of arsenic impact immune development, they impact growth development, they impact IQ development,"" he says. Because of this, the legislation is stricter around products specifically marketed at children - but many other rice products that they may also eat, such as puffed rice cereals, can contain adult levels of arsenic. It sounds quite scary, even if you don't eat lots of rice, but there's an easy solution - a way to cook rice that dramatically reduces the arsenic content. Now, some ways of cooking rice reduce arsenic levels more than others.  We carried out some tests with Prof Meharg and found the best technique is to soak the rice overnight before cooking it in a 5:1 water-to-rice ratio. That cuts arsenic levels by 80%, compared to the common approach of using two parts water to one part rice and letting all the water soak in. Using lots of water - the 5:1 ratio - without pre-soaking also reduced arsenic levels, but not by as much as the pre-soaking levels. So, while I would now think twice about feeding young children too much rice or rice products, I'm not going to stop eating rice myself.  I will, however, be cooking it in more water and, when I remember, leave it to soak overnight.

"This video can not be played Bison bones and Tudor bowling balls: Crossrail's archaeological legacy The skeletons of plague victims, a Tudor bowling ball and medieval ice skates fashioned from animal bones are among hundreds of artefacts on display at a new exhibition showcasing the most interesting finds made during the Crossrail excavations. What's been unearthed undoubtedly offers a fascinating insight into London life over the centuries - but what will be the archaeological legacy of what is Europe's largest infrastructure project? Tens of thousands of artefacts have been dug up during work to create the 42km (26-mile)Elizabeth Line,external, which runs from the east to the west of the capital. With careful planning, 20 sites were excavated by archaeologists at locations where ventilation shafts were put in, where railways entered tunnels and where new ticket halls were to be built. For more archaeology stories and features follow us on Pinterest,external ""We've managed to take a slice down through London but also across London,"" said Jackie Keily, the curator of the exhibition at the Museum of London Docklands. One of Ms Keily's favourite exhibits is a bowling ball discovered at the site of a Tudor manor house in Stepney Green. ""It's amazing it survived,"" she said. This Tudor bowling ball was found preserved in the boggy moat of a manor in Stepney Green These objects, found near Liverpool Street station, have been identified as ice skates with the help of the writings of a 12th Century monk, who described young men skating on bones tied to their shoes ""It had been in a moat which was boggy. Henry VIII brought in a ban banning commoners from bowling. It was only for the aristocracy. ""Stepney Green is now part of Greater London but it would have been a weekend retreat in the countryside."" A chamber pot found beneath 19th Century terraced housing, also in Stepney Green, ranks as another highlight for Ms Keily. ""It dates back to when there were no indoor toilets or bathrooms,"" she said. ""This one is fabulous because it has a shocked-looking man saying: 'What I see I will not tell'."" This chamber pot gives an insight into modesty in Victorian times The discoveries made were by no means restricted to those from Victorian, Tudor or medieval times though, with considerably older items being unearthed, including bison bone fragments in the part of the capital we now call Royal Oak. Asked if there had been previous evidence of bison roaming there, Ms Keily said: ""We kind of knew but it's incredible to find the remains. ""There were three fragments of bison bone and one of reindeer from an antler. They were dated back to about 68,000 years ago. ""Some of the bones had traces of gnawing, possibly from wolves."" Scientific analysis of skeletons identified the DNA of the bacteria that caused the 1665 Great Plague Two finds from the Crossrail project have ended up among the 80 million specimens at the Natural History Museum: a piece of 55-million-year-old amber and two parts of a woolly mammoth jawbone. Both were discovered beneath Canary Wharf. The bone find could prove to be important, as Jessica Simpson from the museum explains: ""They can date the woolly mammoth specimen once it is off display and they might be able to determine when they became extinct in our region. ""The last known woolly mammoths were roaming a small part of northern Siberia about 4,000 years ago."" For Ms Keily, the discovery that will perhaps provide the most significant element of Crossrail's archaeological legacy is the human remains found at Liverpool Street. DNA testing on teeth found in the 17th Century Bedlam cemeteryconfirmed the identity of the bacteriabehind London's Great Plague for the first time. ""That's an important discovery,"" she said. And it's not the only one. Don Walker, senior human osteologist at the Museum of London Archaeology, analysed some skeletons found at Charterhouse Square in Farringdon. This leather shoe is believed to date from the 15th or 16th Century He said of the discovery: ""It was important because we found documented evidence of a Black Death cemetery dating to 1348 or 1349."" Isotope, radiocarbon and DNA analysis was performed in an effort to reveal details such as how a person's diet had changed during their lifetime and where they were likely to have lived. Mr Walker said: ""We don't know much about how infectious diseases interacted with people in the past. ""If we can understand the evolution of infectious diseases such as the plague that will help us understand how diseases will behave in the future."" Asked what the impact of the Crossrail excavations would be, he said: ""I think it goes beyond archaeology and I'm certain there will be some benefits for future medical work as well."" Curator Jackie Keily: ""We've managed to take a slice down through London"" Dr Piers Mitchell from Cambridge University is president of the Paleopathology Association and was part of the team that foundRichard III's skullin a Leicester car park. Asked if Crossrail would go on to be viewed as a significant project in British archaeology, he said: ""The problem with Crossrail is you only get a little vertical shaft, a little box to excavate. ""That gives you a little vignette of life in the past. It's a little bit frustrating. ""They've got lots of little circles and they are trying to interpret London from that."" But he added: ""Only time will tell. If interesting papers are published and we learn more about diseases of the past and how they are changing, it's going to be a good resource to teach students with."" Some of the finds as they were reported Rail projects find 'Black Death' pit Crossrail dig unearths Victorian jars Rail dig 'Bronze Age path' find Cause of London Great Plague confirmed In Pictures: Crossrail skeletons Jay Carver, lead Crossrail archaeologist, believes the project will be held up as an example of how developers, engineers and archaeologists can work together and share finds with the community. He said: ""Every 10 years there's a mega-project that involves a lot of archaeology; previously there was the Eurostar tunnel and then Terminal 5 at Heathrow. ""With each project we are developing the way we work with construction and engineering. In the past archaeologists and engineers have been at loggerheads. ""I think it's been a really successful project."" And it's a project that is set to continue, with plans in place forCrossrail 2,external, the proposed north-south line from Epsom in Surrey to Broxbourne in Hertfordshire. Curzon Soho cinema campaigner Stephen Fry has said he is not being a ""numby"" - not under my backyard - but objects to plans to tear down the building But wherever there are huge infrastructure projects of this kind, there are difficult decisions to be taken, such as the possibility theCurzon cinema in Soho might have to make way,externalfor a new ticket hall. Stephen Fry has said he does not want to be a ""numby"" - not under my backyard - but, as a supporter of the Curzon Soho, objects to the plans as they stand. And the Victorian Society warns Wimbledon is among the areas thatface losing important architectureto Crossrail 2's bulldozers - although a Transport for London spokesperson said: ""Demolition is always our last resort."" Back in east London at the Museum of London Docklands - a stone's throw away from where engineers are putting the finishing touches to the Canary Wharf Crossrail station - Jackie Keily reflects happily on the impact of the several years of excavations. ""It's been an amazing project,"" she said. ""To be able to archaeologically take a slice through London east to west is pretty amazing.""

"A tribunal found courier Maggie Dewhurst should be classed as a worker What is the so-called ""gig"" economy, a phrase increasingly in use, and seemingly so in connection with employment disputes? According to one definition, it is ""a labour market characterised by the prevalence of short-term contracts or freelance work, as opposed to permanent jobs"". And - taking opposing partisan viewpoints - it is either a working environment that offers flexibility with regard to employment hours, or... it is a form of exploitation with very little workplace protection. The latest attempt to bring a degree of legal clarity to the employment status of people in the gig economy has been playing out in the Court of Appeal. A London firm, Pimlico Plumbers,on Friday lost its appealagainst a previous ruling that said one of its long-serving plumbers was a worker - entitled to basic rights, including holiday pay - rather than an independent contractor. Like other cases of a similar nature, such as those involving Uber and Deliveroo, the outcome will now be closely scrutinised for what it means regarding the workplace rights of the millions of people employed in the gig economy in the UK. In the gig economy, instead of a regular wage, workers get paid for the ""gigs"" they do, such as a food delivery or a car journey. In the UK it's estimated thatfive million peopleare employed in this type of capacity. Jobs include couriers, ride-hailing drivers andvideo producers. Proponents of the gig economy claim that people can benefit from flexible hours, with control over how much time they can work as they juggle other priorities in their lives. Workers in the gig economy may be delivering meals In addition, the flexible nature often offers benefits to employers, as they only pay when the work is available, and don't incur staff costs when the demand is not there. Meanwhile, workers in the gig economy are classed as independent contractors. That means they have no protection against unfair dismissal, no right to redundancy payments, and no right to receive the national minimum wage, paid holiday or sickness pay. It is these aspects that are proving contentious. In the past few months two tribunal hearings have gone against employers looking to classify staff as independent contractors. Last October Uber drivers in the UK won the rightto be classed as workers rather than independent contractors. The ruling by a London employment tribunal meant drivers for the ride-hailing app would be entitled to holiday pay, paid rest breaks and the national minimum wage. Uber is appealing against the tribunal finding against it The GMB union described the decision as a ""monumental victory"" for some 40,000 drivers in England and Wales. In December, Uber launched an appeal against the ruling that it had acted unlawfully. And in January this year,a tribunal found that Maggie Dewhurst,a courier with logistics firm City Sprint, should be classed as a worker rather than independent contractor, entitling her to basic rights. And, also towards the end of last year,a group of food takeaway couriers working for Deliveroosaid they were taking legal steps in the UK to gain union recognition and workers' rights. One difference worth noting is that workers in the gig economy differ slightly from those on zero-hours contracts. Those are the - also controversial - arrangements used by companies such as Sports Direct, JD Wetherspoons and Cineworld. Like workers in the gig economy, zero-hours contractors - or casual contractors - don't get guaranteed hours or much job security from their employer. Chancellor Philip Hammond is looking for effective ways to tax workers But people on zero-hours contracts are seen as employees in some sense, as they are entitled to holiday pay. But, like those in the gig economy, they are not entitled to sick pay. Meanwhile, the Department for Business is holding an inquiry into a range of working practices - including the gig economy. The department says it wants to ensure its employment rules are up to date to reflect ""new ways of working"". The status of gig economy workers is of importance to the government,as last November's Autumn Statement showedfor the first time how it is cutting into the government's tax take. The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) estimated that in 2020-21 it will cost the Treasury Â£3.5bn. Chancellor of the Exchequer Philip Hammond said then he would look to find more effective ways to tax workers in the UK's current shifting labour environment.

"Record numbers of common dolphins were recorded last year Record numbers of three dolphin species found off Scotland's west coast were found during a survey by the Hebridean Whale and Dolphin Trust (HWDT). HWDT said its scientists and volunteers last year recorded 2,303 individual common dolphins, 42 bottlenose dolphins and 94 Risso's dolphins. The figures for all three species were the highest ever recorded in the Mull-based trust's annual survey seasons. The conservation charity has been carrying out the surveys since 1994. Dr Lauren Hartny-Mills, HWDT science officer, said: ""The reasons for the high number of sightings of these charismatic dolphin species - and the broader effects on the marine environment and other species - remain unclear. ""But the intriguing findings highlight the importance of on-going monitoring and research."" Frazer Coomber, a scientist from HWDT, told the BBC'sGood Morning Scotland radio programme: ""It's been fantastic. We've had massive groups of 200 and 300 individuals at a time. ""The nice thing about dolphins is that often they come over to the vessel to come and have a look. They swim along at the front of the vessel and you get really close and get to see their beautiful yellow colouration. ""Dolphins are known as indicator species. They are a top predator, and if your top predator in an eco-system is doing well then that's a good sign that everything else in the eco-system is going well.""

"The changes give sweeping new to powers Mr Erdogan A new draft constitution that significantly increases the powers of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has been approved by voters in a referendum. Here, the BBC's Turkey correspondent, Mark Lowen, explains why this was such a bitterly-contested process. In one brawl, a government MP alleged an opponent bit into his leg. In another, a plant pot was hurled across parliament. A microphone was stolen and used as a weapon. An independent MP handcuffed herself to a lectern, sparking another scuffle. The parliamentary debate on changing Turkey's constitution wasn't a mild affair. On the surface, it might seem a proposal that would enjoy cross-party consensus: modernising Turkey's constitution that was drawn up at the behest of the once-omnipotent military after the coup of 1980. But instead it's arguably the most controversial political change in a generation, giving sweeping powers to the country's powerful but divisive President Erdogan. The plan turns Turkey from a parliamentary to a presidential republic. Among the numerous changes: The role of prime minister will be scrapped. The new post of vice president, possibly two or three, will be created. The president becomes the head of the executive, as well as the head of state, and retains ties to a political party. He or she will be given sweeping new powers to appoint ministers, prepare the budget, choose the majority of senior judges and enact certain laws by decree. The president alone will be able to announce a state of emergency and dismiss parliament. Parliament will lose its right to scrutinise ministers or propose an enquiry. However, it will be able to begin impeachment proceedings or investigate the president with a majority vote by MPs. Putting the president on trial would require a two-thirds majority. The number of MPs will increase from 550 to 600. Presidential and parliamentary elections will be held on the same day every five years. The president will be limited to two terms. The government - and, principally, President Erdogan - argue that the reforms streamline decision-making and avoid the unwieldy parliamentary coalitions that have hamstrung Turkey in the past. Since the president is no longer chosen by parliament but now elected directly by the people, goes the argument, he or she should not have to contend with another elected leader (the prime minister) to enact laws. The current system, they say, is holding back Turkey's progress. They even argue that the change could somehow end the extremist attacks that have killed more than 500 people in the past 18 months. Hundreds of people have been killed in attacks in Turkey in the past 18 months A presidential system is all very well in a country with proper checks and balances like the United States, retort critics, where an independent judiciary has shown itself willing to stand up to Donald Trump and a rigorous free press calls him out on contentious policies. But in Turkey, where judicial independence has plummeted and which now ranks 151 of 180 countries in the press freedom index of the watchdog Reporters Without Borders, an all-powerful president would spell the death knell of democracy, they say. Profile: Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Turkey's dominant president 'Open, police!': The day a Turkish writer's life changed Mr Erdogan's opponents already decry his slide to authoritarianism, presiding over the world's biggest jailer of journalists and a country where some 140,000 people have been arrested, dismissed or suspended since the failed coup last year. Granting him virtually unfettered powers, said the main opposition CHP, would ""entrench dictatorship"". Since the failed coup 140,000 people have been arrested, dismissed or suspended from their jobs Ahmet Kasim Han, a political scientist from Kadir Has University, said before the vote: ""It doesn't look as bad as the opposition paints it and it's definitely not as benevolent as the government depicts it. ""The real weakness is that in its hurry to pass the reform, the government hasn't really explained the 2,000 laws that would change. So it doesn't look bright, especially with this government's track record."" How did the referendum come to happen? The governing AK Party had to rely on parliamentary votes from the far-right MHP to lead the country to a referendum. Opposition to the reform was led by the centre-left CHP and the pro-Kurdish HDP parties, the latter of which had been portrayed by the government as linked to terrorism. Several of its MPs and the party leaders are now in prison. Devlet Bahceli, leader of the far right MHP, now supports the proposed constitutional changes AKP and MHP voters who opposed the reform might have felt pressured into voting in favour, so as not to be tarnished as supporting ""terrorists"", especially since the referendum took place under the state of emergency imposed after the attempted coup. ""Holding the vote under this state of emergency makes it susceptible to allegations that people don't feel free to say no,"" says Dr Kasim Han. ""It casts a shadow over the outcome."" With the detail of the constitutional reform impenetrable to many, the referendum became focused around Mr Erdogan himself: a president who elicits utmost reverence from one side of the country and intense hatred from the other. The result will now determine the political fate of this deeply troubled but hugely important country.

"Dr Brittain-George said most staff had been attacked or felt unsafe The body set up to advise hospitals on staff safety is to end that work at the end of March, the BBC has discovered. This is despite figures showing almost 200 assaults on doctors, nurses and other NHS staff in England every day. One A&E doctor said ""most NHS staff"" could say they had been attacked or felt unsafe at work. NHS Protect said it could not comment before a staff consultation ended but the government said it believed a new approach was needed to protect staff. The body was tasked with overseeing the measures that trusts were taking to stop physical attacks on doctors and nurses. It has co-ordinated safety standards and held trusts to account since 2003. Dr Jess Brittain-George, who works in accident and emergency, said: ""Most NHS staff can say they've been attacked or felt unsafe at work, especially those of us on the front line. ""Everyone is on alert and looking out for the patient who is going to kick off. ""When I joined as a student in 2008 it was never mentioned.  I did an A&E placement and no-one talked about it. ""Now it's a running joke in the staffroom - 'What's happened to you today? I've been hit again', or something like that."" Kim Sunley was shocked by the number of assaults on NHS staff Dr Brittain-George works in a hospital that takes staff security seriously and has seen attacks decline, but she says elsewhere in the health service security ""isn't stellar"" and has been frustrated by the unwillingness of police officers to investigate. She says a man told an A&E receptionist that he intended to wait outside to kill her when she left work. ""The police didn't care. They said, 'It's just a threat and it isn't important.' But everyone knows that a threat to your life is an offence and it is prosecutable."" Nurses' leaders say the intense pressure on the health service has fuelled attacks on staff. In total, 70,555 NHS staff were assaulted in 2015-16, according to NHS Protect figures - up 4% on the previous year. Kim Sunley, of the Royal College of Nursing, described it as ""an absolutely shocking figure"". ""You see some horrible physical assaults - people being punched in the face, grabbed by the throat, limbs being broken, chairs being thrown at people. ""There's the physical impact of the injury, but also the psychological impact, the long-term effect. People are traumatised. ""Where people are frustrated and are having to wait a long time, an environment that isn't fit for purpose so you have trolleys in corridors, it's going to increase tension, it's going to increase frustration and it's a tinderbox atmosphere."" Many assaults are carried out by people who lack mental capacity, but it is thought some claim mental disability as a way of dissuading the police from investigating. NHS Protect has stepped in to secure convictions in cases when the police have decided not to act. On the issue of ending security work, NHS Protect said in a statement that it was ""not appropriate for us to comment in detail"" before the consultation with staff ended on 1 March. But it confirmed that it was consulting staff about plans under which ""our organisation would not be tasked with security management work"". It added: ""Work continues on the potential of identifying who might be best placed to take the lead on guiding this work, if it is felt appropriate that another body should take it forward"". A Department of Health said its proposals come amid a ""persistently high numbers of these unacceptable incidents"". A spokesperson added: ""NHS staff work incredibly hard in a high-pressure environment, and it is completely unacceptable for them to be subject to aggression or violence. ""Trusts should have no hesitation in involving the police and pressing for the strongest penalties against offenders.""

"The NHS faces unrelenting pressure despite funding rising. Why? The sheer scale of the NHS can take the breath away. Every 24 hours it sees one million patients, and with 1.7 million staff it's the fifth biggest employer in the world. This vast enterprise absorbs eye-watering amounts of money. Last year Â£140bn was spent on health across the UK - more than 10 times the figure that was ploughed in 60 years ago. And that's after you adjust it for inflation. Governments over the years have had to invest more and more of the public purse into it. Today 30p out of every Â£1 spent on services goes on health. Even during the years of deep austerity, extra money has been found for the health service - Â£8bn more this Parliament in England alone. Yet it seems no matter how much is invested, it's still not enough. The NHS is creaking at the seams. The best barometer of this is the four-hour A&E target. We often think of it as an indication of how good an emergency department is. But it's not. It doesn't tell you about the quality of care - how quickly you get pain relief or whether the unit is good at spotting the signs of a heart attack. Instead it's a sign of whether the system is under stress - both in the community and in the hospital. Which local services are under threat? Upfront charges for foreign patients When there's perfect harmony between the numbers arriving and leaving 95% of patients will be dealt with in four hours. But this isn't happening. You have to go back to the summer of 2015 for the last time it was met in England, with performance deteriorating markedly year on year. The rest of the UK is not immune either. Four-hour performance is worse in Wales and Northern Ireland. Scotland is performing a little better, but is still some way short of the target - its major hospitals have been hovering around the 90% mark in recent weeks. The ageing population is certainly a major factor - and it's one that all health systems in the world are struggling with. Medical advances have meant that people are living longer. When the NHS was created, life expectancy was 13 years shorter than it is now. This is something to celebrate. Infectious diseases are no longer a significant threat. Heart attacks do not claim the lives of people early in the same numbers. Even cancer is not the death sentence it once was - half of people now survive for a decade or more. But this progress has come at a cost. People are living with a growing number of long-term chronic conditions - diabetes, heart disease and dementia. These are more about care than cure - what patients usually need is support. By the age of 65, most people will have at least one of these illnesses. By 75 they will have two. The average 65-year-old costs the NHS 2.5 times more than the average 30-year-old. An 85-year-old costs more than five times as much. As the numbers continue to rise so does the cost to the NHS. This is compounded by the rising cost of new drugs. The health service is currently considering capping the amount it will pay for new drugs at Â£20m each a year. A fifth of new treatments coming on stream cost more than this. Then there's obesity. A third of adults are so overweight they are risking their health significantly. All this contributes to what health economists call health inflation - the idea that the cost of providing care outstrips the normal rise in the cost of living across the economy. This is why health has tended to get more generous rises than other areas of government spending. Over the years this has been achievable through a combination of economic growth, which brings in more money through tax, and reducing spending in areas such as defence, which has led to the NHS taking an ever-greater share of the public purse. But, of course, the economy goes through cycles and over the years governments have varied the amount they were willing or able to give. Since the NHS was created in 1948, the average annual rise has been just over 4%. During the Labour years under Blair and Brown this was closer to 7%. As you can see the period since 2010 has seen the tightest financial settlements. What is more, the spending squeeze is continuing during this Parliament at almost exactly the same rate, even with England's extra Â£8bn going in. Ministers in England are right to say they are increasing funding - it's been frozen in Wales and Scotland - but it's just that it doesn't compare favourably with what the NHS has traditionally got. Indeed, the Institute for Fiscal Studies believes over the 10 years to 2020, the NHS budget across the UK will not have increased enough to keep pace with the ageing and growing population. But is it just a matter of more money? Would an extra few billion make all the problems go away? If you look at other European nations the UK is certainly spending less as a proportion of GDP, which is a measure of the size of the economy. The result, as you would expect, is fewer beds, doctors and nurses per patient in the UK than the big spenders. But a number of these countries achieve that by taxing more. Would the UK public stomach that? If a poll by Ipsos MORI for the BBC this week is anything to go by, they are pretty split - 40% would back a rise in income tax and 53% would support National Insurance going up. Nor does it seem there's appetite for a change in the system. A majority were against charging for services or moving to an insurance-based model like some of our European neighbours do. But even if more money was spent or raised, that would not lead to an overnight improvement. More doctors and nurses would need training and that takes time and, crucially, there is not a flood of people wanting to work in key posts. Trainee posts for GPs are being increased, but the NHS cannot fill them all. There also remain big questions over whether the structure of the NHS is right for 21st Century healthcare. The NHS is still centred on the network of district general hospitals that emerged during the hospital building boom of the 1960s. But in an era where people are struggling with those chronic illnesses, what they really need is support in the community. The problem is there's a serious shortage of this. The number of district nurses in England has been cut by 28% in the past five years, while getting a GP appointment is becoming increasingly difficult. The result is that people end up going to hospital. The numbers visiting A&E have risen by a third in 12 years. Not all of this is down to people with these chronic conditions, but they tend to be the cases that take the most care. Two-thirds of hospitals beds are occupied by the one-third of the population with a long-term condition. There are attempts to change this. To place more emphasis on care outside hospital. NHS England chief executive Simon Stevens has set out a five-year plan to create more integrated care, which involves hospital services working more closely with their local community teams. Similar moves are being made in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. There also an emphasis on prevention - getting people to be more active, eat better diets and drink less. But perhaps the biggest problem is council-run social care. This encompasses day centres, help in the home for tasks such as washing and dressing, and good quality care in care homes during the final years of life. It is seen as essential to keep people well and living independently - and out of hospital. In an era when the population is ageing you would expect more people to be getting help from the state. However, the opposite is true. In England over the past four years, the number of older people getting help has fallen by a quarter. The result is large numbers going without care or having to pay for it themselves. The other parts of the UK can make a case for being more generous in this respect - home care is capped at Â£60 a week in Wales and free for the over-75s in Northern Ireland, while Scotland provides free personal care (washing and dressing) in both care homes and people's own homes. But none of them has cracked it. Indeed, if you were setting up a health and care service today, ask yourself this - how would it be done? Would you separate medical care from personal care? Give one service to a national institution and the other to local councils?  Would you provide one free at the point of need and charge for the other? Would you increase the budget of one, but cut the other? Would you build more than 200 hospitals and spend over half of your budget on them when the biggest users of care are people with long-term illnesses that need care rather than medical intervention? But as that is the system we have got at a time when money is limited, we are falling back on a typical British trait - making do.

"The Crau plain grasshopper is confined to a small area of the South of France The first comprehensive assessment of Europe's crickets and grasshoppers has found that more than a quarter of species are being driven to extinction. According to the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), the insect group is the most threatened of those assessed so far in Europe. Europe harbours more than 1,000 species of grasshopper and cricket. If we don't act now the sound of crickets could become a thing of the past, said the IUCN. Crickets, bush crickets and grasshoppers - a group known asOrthoptera- live on grassland. They are an important food source for birds and reptiles, and their decline could affect entire ecosystems. Their habitat is being lost due to wildfires, intensive agriculture and tourism development. The knotty sand grasshopper is threatened by tourist development Jean-Christophe ViÃ©, deputy director, IUCN Global Species Programme, said to bring these species back from the brink of extinction, more needs to be done to protect and restore their habitats. ""This can be done through sustainable grassland management using traditional agricultural practices, for example,"" he said. ""If we do not act now, the sound of crickets in European grasslands could soon become a thing of the past."" The assessment took place over two years and involved more than 150 scientists. Axel Hochkirch is chair of the IUCN invertebrate conservation sub-committee and lead author of thereport,external. ""If we lose grasshoppers and otherOrthopteralike crickets and bush crickets, we will lose diversity,"" he told BBC News. ""They are very good indicators of biodiversity in open ecosystems."" The Adriatic marbled bush cricket is classed as endangered The experts are particularly concerned about species that occupy small ranges, such as the Crau plain grasshopper, which lives only on the Crau plain in the South of France. Some populations are also being lost through wildfires, particularly in Greece and on the Canary Islands. ""The results from this IUCN Red List are deeply worrying,"" said Luc Bas, director of the IUCN European Regional Office. The report recommends the setting up of a monitoring programme across Europe to obtain information on population trends.

"This video can not be played 'This American carnage stops right here,' Donald Trump said at his inauguration During his presidential campaign, and since taking office, Donald Trump has repeatedly warned of the dangers facing the United States. ""I have learned a lot in the past two weeks,"" he told a meeting of police officers in Washington DC on Wednesday. ""Terrorism is a far greater threat than the people of our country understand. I'm going to take care of it."" His comments came as the legal battle continued over his travel ban on people from seven Muslim-majority nations. Not putting the ban in place would mean the US ""can never have the security and safety to which we are entitled"", he said on Twitter. On Wednesday, he also lamented inner-city violence, as well as the killing of police officers. It is a vision of an America full of danger, with multiple threats on many fronts, encapsulated by the new president's inaugural address referencing ""American carnage"". But is it correct? This video can not be played In July 2016, the BBC's More or Less programme investigated the unreliable numbers around police shootings in the USA. ""The number of officers shot and killed in the line of duty last year increased by 56% from the year before,"" President Trump said on Wednesday. And the statistic is accurate, unlike some others he has quoted in the past. The number of officers shot and killed in the line of duty did indeed jump 56%, from41in 2015 to64last year - that's according to theNational Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund.,external It is a stark statistic. Starker still is the fact that21of those officers were killed in ambush-style shootings, a163% increaseon the previous year. However, it would be incorrect to read from this that a wave of police shootings has swept the country. Eight of those killings were in two assaults in 10 days in July 2016, inDallas, TexasandBaton Rouge, Louisiana, and occurred in the context of protests against police killings of African-Americans. ""Last year in Dallas, police officers were targeted for execution - think of this, whoever heard of this?"" President Trump told the meeting of police officers. But the targeting of police officers is not in itself a new phenomenon - it is only that 2016 had higher numbers than before. And statistics show that officers are still more likely to be shot dead responding to a domestic disturbance than any other incident. In fact, if you look at the bigger picture, police deaths on duty have been dropping for some time. The worst year for police deaths was 1930, when307died. More recently, there was a peak of241in 2001, largely due to the 11 September attacks. But between 2011 and 2013, there was an almost40% dropin police fatalities - from177 to 109. The numbers have crept up again in the years since - up 10% in 2016 to135- but there is an overall pattern of decline, with the numbers now down to the levels of the 1950s. Having said that, the likelihood of a police officer being shot dead is far higher than that of a member of the public being killed by the police. Read more:How many police die every year? ""Right now, many communities in America are facing a public safety crisis,"" President Trump told police in Washington on Wednesday. ""Murders in 2015 experienced their largest single-year increase in nearly half a century. His statement is factually correct (though he has often, wrongly, said that the murder rate was the highest it has been in nearly half a century, and even attacked the press on Tuesday for not reporting this falsehood.) There wasa 10.8% jumpin nationwide murder ratesfrom 2014 to 2015,external, and that represents the biggest year-to-year increasesince 1970-71, according to the fact-checking websitePolitifact,external. But it is again important to look at the longer-term trend. The number of reported murders and rapes across the country did indeed increase from 2014 to 2015, as did robberies. But all are still below the levels they were at 10 years ago - and are respectively13%, 6% and 34% lowerthan 20 years ago (even though the population of the US has increased by55 millionin that time). The picture is more mixed in large cities, however. This video can not be played In September 2016, Donald Trump said some US inner cities were more dangerous than Afghanistan - the BBC's More or Less programme investigated his claim. Last month, The Economist magazine, having obtained an early look at the 2016 FBI data for violence in 50 US cities, showed that there were four broad trends in play. Murder rates are stable in 13 of the 50 cities, including Los Angeles and New York, which saw11 days without a murder,externalin 2015. In 15 other cities, including Houston and Las Vegas, murder rates are low but increasing. In another nine, including Philadelphia and Detroit, they are high but stable. And in 13, including Indianapolis and Chicago, they are high and rising. (You can read The Economist's analysishere,external). This video can not be played Life and death on the lost streets of Chicago In Chicago, murders rose sharply last year, with more than 760 last year compared with 473 the year before. Up to then, there had beena steady fall,externalin the number of murders since a peak of the early 70s. Mr Trump has repeatedly used the city as an example. ""In Chicago, more than 4,000 people were shot last year alone and the rate so far this year has been even higher. What is going on in Chicago?"" he said on Wednesday. Last month, he even threatenedto send federal agents into the city,externalif the violence did not subside. But again, worrying though recent increases in violence in some cities may be, it is critical to look at how those increases fit in to a longer-term trend. Ames Grawert, of the Brennan Center for Justice, co-authored a report into crime rates in US cities, and spoke to the BBC's More or Less programme. ""If you look at crime rates in American cities in the past 30 years, even with the recent uptick in murders in some cities, we are very far below where we used to be with murder rates in big cities like New York and Los Angeles."" Read more (from 2015):Why have cities' murder rates increased? President Trump, when he announced the travel restrictions last month, said it was to ""keep radical Islamic terrorists out of the US"". The restrictions, now in legal limbo, affected citizens from Iraq, Syria, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, and Yemen - the measuresalso blocked Syrian refugeesfrom arriving in the US. So how big a problem is terrorism in the US? First of all, Mr Trump, like other presidents before him, measures the danger of terrorism to the US according to whatcouldhappen, rather than whathashappened. His comment ""I have learned a lot in the past two weeks"" indicated he had specific information on the threat to the US. And secondly, it all depends on what your definition of what terrorism is (more on that later on). Read more:Trump says terror attacks 'under-reported': Is that true? One study, by the libertarian Cato Institute, details3,432murders committed on US soil between 1975 and late 2015 that it says can be classified as terrorist attacks. Of those,88%were committed by foreign-born terrorists who entered the country (the 2,977 deaths in the 11 September attacks make up a large chunk of these fatalities). But does this mean Americans should be worried about being caught up in a terror attack caused by a foreign-born national? Take a look at the numbers the Cato Institute came up with to provide context: The report's author, Alex Nowrasteh,concluded,externalthe number of Americans killed in a terror attack by someone from one of the seven countries on Mr Trump's list, between 1975 and 2015, waszero. (He does point out that six Iranians, six Sudanese, two Somalis, two Iraqis, and one Yemeni were convicted of attempting or carrying out terrorist attacks on US soil in that time). Onlythreedeaths were attributed to refugees in the 40 years spanned by the report - and those were caused by three Cuban terrorists in the 1970s. For some perspective, here are some other causes of death in the US in 2015 alone: Far more dangerous than terrorism to Americans are painkillers. The leading cause of accidental death in the United States is now overdoses from painkillers - opioid medicines kill60 people a day, or22,000 a year,according to the National Safety Council,external. But it is impossible to discuss the threat from terrorism without looking at how the US defines terrorism itself - and therein lies the problem. Even the FBI says there is ""no single, universally accepted, definition of terrorism,external"". The State Departmentdefines terrorism,externalas ""premeditated, politically motivated violence perpetrated against non-combatant targets by subnational groups or clandestine agents"". In that case, there is an argument that shootings should be defined as terrorism: those such as the racially-motivated killingof nine black worshippersin South Carolina by a self-avowed white supremacist,  the murderof 26 peopleincluding children in Newtown, Connecticut, and the murder of 12 peoplein a Colorado cinema. If the number of people killed in shootings in the US were considered terrorism - at least15,055 peoplewere shot dead last year, according tothe Gun Violence Archive,external- then the likelihood of an American being killed in an act of terrorism would increase substantially.

"Around the UK, trusts are coming up with innovative ways of relieving the pressure on the NHS and improving people's health - in hospitals, in GP surgeries, in care homes and in accident and emergency units. In May last year, the A&E department at Queen's Hospital, Romford, started a six-week trial to divert patients away from the department. Patients that attended A&E would be seen as soon as they walked into the department by either a consultant or a GP. ""The doctors would review them, and if appropriate they would redirect them to a more appropriate setting,"" says Sarah Tedford, chief operating officer at Barking, Havering and Redbridge University Hospitals NHS Trust. ""For a lot of patients that actually meant self care - so these were patients who, with the right reassurance, could actually manage the condition themselves."" Alternatively, patients would be redirected to a pharmacist or to their GP so they could get an appointment for a later date. The trial worked so well that it has been adopted full time. They currently divert between 60 and 90 patients a day. ""Most of them can be seen and assessed within five minutes,"" instead of potentially waiting for hours, Sarah Tedford says. She says the staff and most patients have taken to it ""very well"" and they have have been asked to go and talk to other hospitals about it. ""It's just really important to stress it's about directing patients to the most appropriate setting rather than waiting in a busy emergency department where they don't actually need to be,"" she says. ""It's about reassuring the public - it's not turning away sick patients, that's absolutely not what it's about."" In Glasgow, older patients have been helped to leave hospital thanks to a programme that opened 90 beds in private nursing homes. Discharge policies were changed so that patients could leave hospital within 72 hours, and their long-term needs could be assessed outside hospital, rather than lying in a hospital bed. The intermediate care programme, as it is called, was set up in 2014 by Glasgow City Council and NHS Greater Glasgow & Clyde. David Williams, the chief officer for Glasgow City Health and Social Care Partnership, says they asked the care home providers to work with them to ""look at re-enablement and rehabilitating"" the people placed in the homes. ""We set targets to get 30% of people home that came into intermediate care beds, and we have achieved that consistently,"" he says. Beforehand, those people would probably have ended up going into residential nursing care for the rest of their days, he adds. Now, moving patients out of hospital beds more quickly has helped the system to flow. Last week, figures showed there were only 24 patients aged over 65 who had been delayed leaving hospital. That compares with 140 people in 2014. Dr King Sun Leong, a diabetes consultant, sees patients before their health deteriorates In the Wirral, a community diabetes clinic is reaching patients who can't travel or don't want to come to hospital. These are the people that Dr King Sun Leong, a consultant in diabetes, worries about. He set up the clinic in November 2015, because he wanted to get access to patients earlier to try to stop type-2 diabetes from taking hold, which can lead to heart attacks, strokes and other health issues. Working with a GP and a specialist nurse, Dr Leong monitors patients' diets and lifestyle, talks to them about their work and their social life and how they lead their lives. He also gives them advice and treatment with the aim of preventing future complications. ""If you've got a little hole in your roof, you want to stop it turning into a big hole,"" Dr Leong says, explaining why it's crucial to see patients early on in the community. And they've had good results. With two community diabetes clinics now in the Wirral, more nurses are being trained to deal with the care of type-2 diabetes and more people are being helped to avoid long-term health problems. Patients visiting GPs in Rotherham are not just offered the normal array of drugs and treatment - they are given the option of exercise clubs, arts groups, metal work clubs and yoga. The concept - known as social prescribing - is based on evidence that shows about a fifth of patients visiting GPs have a social rather than medical problem. The scheme - run by Voluntary Action, a partnership of more than 20 organisations - was launched in 2012. Now, every GP practice is using it and more than 2,000 patients have benefited. GPs and social workers refer those who they believe would benefit to one of five social-prescribing workers. They visit the patient in their home to carry out an assessment and work out what prescription to offer them. It certainly seems to be working. An evaluation has found A&E visits have dropped by a fifth among those who have had a social prescription. The council and local NHS has started working together in the London borough of Sutton to keep care home residents well. GPs have been employed to carry out regular visits of care homes, with each resident now receiving six-monthly check-ups. A pharmacist is on hand to visit homes to carry out medicine reviews. And district nurses have been used to train care home staff in dementia, falls and diabetes. It certainly seems to be working. Since the project started in 2015, there has been a 10% drop in visits to A&E. But help is also on hand when care home residents need to go into hospital. It's a relatively simple concept. When a care home resident needs to go into a hospital, a red bag is packed for them. It contains their details, vital information about their health conditions, supplies of medicine, and even a change of clothes for when they are ready to be discharged - after cases where hospitals had to borrow clothes from lost property when patients had been ready for discharge. The initiative also sees a member of the care home staff visiting the patient in hospital within 48 hours of admission. And this all helps doctors and nurses treat them more effectively. The result is older people are spending less time in hospital - eight days, which is four fewer than before the scheme was set up.

"La La Land? More Na Na Land according to this survey Want to get lucky this Valentine's Day? Then you had better leave show tunes off your shuffle queue. According to a new poll, songs from musicals are the least likely to get played in the British bedroom. Musicals came dead last in a list of the 19 genres of music that couples listen to as the lights go down. Even chamber music, thrash metal and hymns ranked higher in a survey of more than 2,000 people conducted by Birmingham's Symphony Hall. Musicals like Chicago and Cabaret are not sexy - apparently So what musical genre was judged to have the most sex appeal? Well, it's no surprise to find it's good ol' R&B. Sixteen percent of respondents chose it as their favourite bedroom music - proving once and for all that there is indeed nothing wrong with a little bump and grind. Twelve percent chose chart music, while just over one in 10 chose classic pop from the 1980s and '90s. Heaven, it seems, really is a place on earth. Even metal bands like Metallica rank higher The survey found that 43% of people play music while making love - though the percentage skews much higher with younger people. Sixty percent of 18-24 year olds said they liked listening to music while getting intimate, as opposed to 38% of over-55s. It also makes a difference whether you've tied the knot - or not. Sixty-two percent of unmarried couples like to have something playing in the background, compared with 28% of married ones.

"Walter Swinburn was found in the courtyard of his home by his father Former jockey Walter Swinburn fell to his death from his bathroom window, an inquest heard. The three-time Derby winner and Shergar rider was found by his father in the courtyard of his London home. It was not possible to establish whether his epilepsy - the result of a riding accident in 1996 - contributed to the fall, Westminster Coroner's Court was told. Coroner Dr Shirley Radcliffe ruled his death on 12 December was an accident. The court heard he suffered a fatal head injury after falling 12 feet (3.5m) from the window at his home in Belgravia. Walter Swinburn was known for his victories riding Shergar including winning the Derby by 10 lengths at Epsom in 1981, aged just 19. Mr Swinburn was nicknamed the 'Choirboy' and picked up numerous successes around the world before his retirement in 2000. The 55-year-old was best known for his partnership with Shergar, which had at one time an estimated worth of Â£10m as the most famous and valuable racehorse in the world. He had suffered from post-traumatic epilepsy after falling from a racehorse in Hong Kong in 1996, which left him prone to seizures. He took over a training licence from his father-in-law, Peter Harris, in 2004 and went on to send out over 260 winners from his yard in Tring, Hertfordshire, before quitting in 2011. He claimed one of the biggest victories of his training career in 2011 when Julienas won the Royal Hunt Cup at Ascot.

"Demonstrators spell out ""No Muslim Ban"" at a protest in Boston Federal circuit courts usually toil in anonymity. They are a legal rest stop for landmark cases on the way to the Supreme Court. But this week it was different. All eyes were on three judges of the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, who, for a brief moment, had the fate of Donald Trump's immigration order in their hands. They were considering whether to sustain a temporary injunction preventing implementation of Mr Trump's sweeping travel ban on seven predominantly Muslim nations. On Thursday night they gave their ruling. Mr Trump's order stayed on ice. Here are three things we learned from the ruling - and two questions that remain unanswered. 1. The immigration ban is going nowhere fast The Ninth Circuit was the Trump administration's best chance to get the president's immigration order up and running again quickly. The three judges could have re-instated the order and closed the borders as early as Thursday night. Instead, the order remains in limbo and it's likely to take time to resolve. The Supreme Court could hear an appeal, but the chances of more than four justices agreeing to reverse the Ninth Circuit ruling seem slim. Is Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Sonia Sotomayor, Stephen Breyer or Elena Kagan going to side with Mr Trump? Not likely. More on this story Trump loses appeal court bid to reinstate travel ban Banned: An Iraqi family's immigration story Is the US heading for a constitutional crisis? What the Trump team has said about Islam If this goes back down to the district court in Seattle, where it began, the gears of justice will grind even more slowly. A trial on the merits - which is slated to happen next, pending Supreme Court action - is a slow process. Briefs need to be filed. Evidence has to be submitted. Oral arguments will be scheduled. These things can take months or even years. That's a painful lesson Barack Obama learned in 2015, when a district court judge blocked implementation of some of his immigration reforms and the Supreme Court didn't hear the case for more than a year. 2. The case will be no slam-dunk for Trump This may seem obvious now, but on Thursday the president was fairly certain that his case was open-and-shut when he read what he viewed as the governing immigration statute to a gathering of law enforcement officers. ""You can be a lawyer, or you don't have to be a lawyer; if you were a good student in high school or a bad student in high school, you can understand this,"" he said. ""And it's really incredible to me that we have a court case that's going on so long."" This video can not be played Bob Ferguson: Travel ban was adopted with ""little thought, little planning, little oversight"" Some conservatives, as well,wrote,externalthat the governing laws were clear that the president has broad powers when dealing with immigration issues. ""For all except the most partisan, it is likely impossible to read the Washington state lawsuit... and not come away with the conclusion that the Trump order is on sound legal and constitutional ground."" In the end, however, the three justices - two appointed by Democrats and one nominated by Republican George W Bush - saw things differently. While they acknowledged the president's authority on immigration matters, they said the statute Mr Trump cited was not the final word on the matter. ""Although our jurisprudence has long counselled deference to the political branches on matters of immigration and national security, neither the Supreme Court nor our court has ever held that courts lack the authority to review executive action in those arenas for compliance with the Constitution,"" the judges wrote. In other words, federal immigration law may have been on Mr Trump's side, but the Constitution wasn't. 3. The haphazard rollout hurt the order At the heart of the Ninth Circuit's decision to uphold the injunction against Mr Trump's order was that it violated the constitutional due process rights of all persons in the US, regardless of their citizenship or immigration status. And time and time again the judges pointed to how the order was initially implemented as reason for keeping it on hold. They wrote that permanent residents and lawful visa holders were not given ""constitutionally sufficient notice and an opportunity to respond"". While they noted that the Trump administration had since interpreted the order as allowing all permanent residents into the US, they were unconvinced that this new interpretation would be uniformly followed or safe from reversal. This video can not be played How travel ban prompted a heartfelt act of kindness They said that the travel ban caused considerable harm, including the separation of families, stranding of US residents abroad and prevention of students and employees from travelling to American universities. A more measured, orchestrated rollout of the immigration order may have avoided these complications, weakening the case against it. Mr Trump said on Wednesday that speed was necessary in implementing the ban because otherwise a ""whole pile of bad people, perhaps with very evil intentions"" would enter the country before border restrictions tightened. Here, however, haste may have killed his legal case. 1. Is the immigration order anti-Muslim? Shortly after the Ninth Circuit issued its opinion, Nevada Democratic Senator Catherine Cortez Masto released a statement saying that the court ""reaffirms that President Trump's hateful and divisive executive order amounts to religious discrimination against Muslims"". While the decision was certainly a blow for the Trump administration, the judges were notably restrained in discussing the religious issue. ""The states' claims raise serious allegations and present significant constitutional questions,"" the judges wrote. Then they said they wouldn't consider the question further, since they had already decided the case on due process grounds. They did offer one clue as to how they might eventually rule, however. The Trump administration had insisted that the order must be judged on its own, without taking into consideration past remarks made by Mr Trump and his supporters touting a ""Muslim ban"". The judges disagreed. ""It is well established that evidence of purpose beyond the face of the challenged law may be considered in evaluating Establishment and Equal Protection Clause claims."" In other words, when it comes time to consider whether the order amounted to a de facto Muslim ban, everything is on the table - Trump tweets, Rudy Giuliani diatribes and all. 2. What happens next? Now that the Ninth Circuit has rendered its decision, the ball is firmly in the Trump administration's court. They could appeal to the US Supreme Court, where the eight justices - four liberal, four conservative - can consider as much, or as little, of the ruling as they see fit. Mr Trump certainly seemed to hint that this was the next step,tweeting,external: ""SEE YOU IN COURT, THE SECURITY OF OUR NATION IS AT STAKE!"" shortly after the ruling. The administration could also decide to let the circuit court's decision stand and fight out the case in a full trial back in the Seattle district court. This would buy the president time to get his Supreme Court nominee, Neil Gorsuch, confirmed by the Republican-held Senate. Then, when the case eventually made its way to the high court, his chances of victory could be markedly improved. Whatever happens, it's clear that this case will be a political football. The fight will be personal, and it will be ugly. What Trump team has said about Islam The people around Donald Trump Reality check: Is Donald Trump's cabinet facing historic obstruction?

"This video can not be played The BBC's Alex Forsyth travelled to Lebanon to meet some of Syria's refugee children There have been angry recriminations about the UK's apparentscaling back of plans to accept unaccompanied child refugees. Lord Dubs, with all the moral freight and sense of history of a refugee from Nazism, said the government was going back on its own commitments. But is the UK really shirking its international obligations? Figures published this week about aid for Syrian refugees might put the UK government into a less hard-hearted light. One year ago, London hosted amajor international conference to raise humanitarian funds for Syria. There were huge pledges of $12bn (Â£9.6bn) in grants and $40bn (Â£32bn) in loans to help a region struggling with unprecedented numbers of refugees escaping war and persecution. A Syrian child who was part of a group washed ashore in Cyprus this week But after the photo-opportunities and handshakes and ministerial convoys - who actually paid up? The financial report shows that a year later Ireland has paid more than Saudi Arabia and Estonia has donated more than China - not as a proportion of their economies, but in hard cash. In terms of both promises and delivery for funds in 2016, a quartet of donors made up a huge slice of what was supposed to be a global effort. The Syrian war has pushed people across many countries These are the US, Germany, the European Union and the UK - all of which have given more than they initially pledged. The Netherlands, Japan and Norway are the next in this list of donors, but some way behind. According to this annual reckoning, Saudi Arabia pledged $200m (Â£160m) for 2016 and has so far committed to $27.9m (Â£22m). In contrast, Ireland, promised $21.9m (Â£17.6m) for this Middle East conflict and has actually paid up $27.9m (Â£22m). China promised $35m (Â£28m) and so far has delivered $3m (Â£2.4m). This in the end was less than Estonia, a country with a population of 1.3 million, which promised $2.2m (Â£1.76m) but gave a higher sum of $3.2m (Â£2.6m). Canada had been relatively generous in its promise - with a pledge of $71.3m (Â£57.3m). But it proved to be even more forthcoming in practice - delivering $201m (Â£161m), more than any of the Middle Eastern countries making pledges. There might have been a long list of 48 countries and organisations at the London conference pledging support for Syria in 2016, but in practice the fundraising effort has depended on the big contributions from the top four donors. The UK, the smallest donor of this quartet, alone promised $731m (Â£584m) and gave $741m (Â£592m). The next phase of this accounting - for pledges for 2017 to 2020 - gets even sketchier. Refugees from Syria's war now living in Lebanon The EU, the UK, Germany and Norway are the big long-haul donors - but a majority of those who made pledges for 2016 have not promised anything at all for the following years. The world community has promised $6bn (Â£4.8bn) humanitarian aid up to 2020 - but Saudi Arabia and China are among those absent from the donors. And 60% of the total pledges are from the EU, the UK, and Germany. There are a handful of countries who are donating even though they have not made pledges, such as Canada and Ireland. Optimists might take heart from the eventual level of funding for 2016 - where grants have exceeded the original promises by about a third. And of course there are other ways of donating directly or through charities that countries might choose. But so far less than half of the promises at the London conference for 2017 to 2020 have been honoured - and in terms of the loans promised only 31% have been delivered. It's also interesting to look at the detail of who is getting the money. Turkey is the second-biggest recipient in 2016, after Syria. And from 2017 to 2020, the biggest recipient of this ""Syrian"" support will be Turkey by some distance, ahead of Syria, Lebanon, Jordan and Iraq. Turkey is host to the largest number of refugees in the region, with the UNHCR reporting 2.8 million Syrian refugees registered in the country. Gordon Brown warned of ""post-truth economics"" over aid funding Apart from immediate humanitarian aid, a key aim of the fundraising has been to provide an education for all of Syria's refugees - with fears of the damage to a ""lost generation"". Former Prime Minister Gordon Brown, a UN envoy for education, appeared before the International Development Select Committee a couple of weeks ago - and warned about what was at stake. In righteous indignation, he criticised the broken promises that meant many young Syrian refugees had lost their chance of an education along with their homes. He warned that half of all Syrian refugee children were not in a classroom - and many would never enter school at all. When it came to promises of aid, he told MPs: ""There is a post-truth economics as well as a post-truth politics."" And despite the billion-dollar handshakes, he said, world leaders had not come up with the goods. Syrian refugees housed in tents in Greece this winter The price for this lack of education would be paid in increased migration, extremism, poverty and political instability, Mr Brown said. ""Of course, there will always be a battle publicly about how well aid is used,"" he told MPs. ""I will just give you one figure about education that people sometimes forget. ""Take all the aid agencies in the world together, including the Department for International Development, the World Bank, Unesco and Unicef, and the average expenditure per child in low and middle-income countries on education through aid, with all these agencies taken together, is less than $10 (Â£8) per head per year,"" Mr Brown told the select committee. ""This is less than the cost of a textbook, so nobody can say that we are overspending on aid for kids who are desperately in need of educational opportunity.""

"Patient Georg Thoma after his hip operation The day after his hip replacement, Georg Thoma was cheerfully sitting up in bed. Like most Germans, the businessman pays into compulsory health insurance. He contributes 7% of his salary before tax and his employers match that amount. In return, patients get access to care which is so rapid that national waiting data is not collected. ""The doctor said to me that I have to decide when I get the operation. Normally it takes three or four weeks."" Georg travels for work to the UK and tells me he was astonished to hear that patients can sometimes wait months for a similar routine operation. Germany's spending on health care is relatively high, just over 11% of its wealth, compared to 9.8% in the UK and it has more doctors and hospital beds per patient than the UK. Georg's operation was carried out in an 80-bed hospital in one of the Black Forest towns in the south-west region Baden Wurttemberg. But even in Germany's well-funded system, the financial viability of a hospital this small is not guaranteed. A group of doctors in this area is trying to manage costs in an experiment that has attracted interest from the UK. Dr Martin Wetzel is focusing on prevention work Martin Wetzel, a GP for 25 years, explains they have done a deal with big insurance funds to make prevention a priority. ""I have more time - and it needs more time to explain to patients what I'm doing and why. So my consultations changed from an eye wink to an average of 15 minutes,"" he says. During that time patients might be offered a range of interventions to improve their health provided locally, which frees up time for the GP. These include subsidised gym sessions, access to different sports and nutrition advice as well as screening programmes to reduce loneliness as well as increasing healthiness. It is being run by a company called Gesundes Kinzigtal in which the doctors are majority shareholders. Already a couple of years into their 10-year project, they say healthcare is costing 6% less than you would expect for the population. They are trying to improve data sharing and believe hospital treatment can be reduced further. Much of the vision comes from its chief executive Helmut Hildebrandt, a pharmacist and public health expert. Hospital doctors on a ward round He says the health insurance funds have tended to concentrate on short-term cost control measures, rather than improving the health of their patients. ""At the moment the economy in Germany runs so well they don't have a problem. But in the long run every politician or administrator knows in the next 10 or 20 years the system will run into a crisis."" He fears that could undermine the commitment to the health insurance covering most Germans, with a risk of richer people opting out of it. What Gesundes Kinzigtal is trying to do is similar to some integrated care projects in the NHS. There is more money in the German system, but arguably more waste too. The Caesarean rate is higher, so is the use of MRI for diagnosis and the length of hospital stay. Patients waiting to see a GP in Thuringia And in many ways there has been little incentive for change in a system where doctors still have a high degree of influence and life expectancy in Germany is not higher than the UK. Bernadette Klapper heads the health section of the Robert Bosch Foundation, which funds social policy innovation. ""I think we should get more for the money we spend inside healthcare. While we see other countries spending less, but having the same results as us, there's something wrong."" Germany is ageing very rapidly, only just behind Japan in forecast for its population profile. But the health system is changing slowly and the Bosch foundation is trying to encourage more small health centres. Many doctors in Germany set up in practice on their own, as GPs or out-of-hospital specialists, but as cities are more popular that leaves rural areas with a shortage. Travel east to the wide open rolling countryside of Thuringia and you get a glimpse of the challenge. Five years ago they were 200 GPs short of what was needed in this region. It has taken grants, and offers of help with housing and arranging childcare, to reduce that to 60. A community nurse treats a patient Annette Rommel is head of the doctors' association in the village of Mechterstadt and says: ""A few years ago we arranged for specially-trained nurses to make home visits and for more teamwork with nurses and doctors together."" It is similar to the way many community nurses work in the UK, but in Germany this is a recent development. Nurses have a much more restricted role. On a visit I saw a nurse and a carer, who is paid for out of the long-term care insurance that Germany introduced 20 years ago, check up on an elderly couple. It has reduced the amount families have to pay, although social care can still be a financial worry. There is enough money in the German system to make trying new approaches to healthcare a little easier. Most patients feel they can see a doctor easily, so for example the number of visits to the equivalent of A&E is very low compared to the UK. While out of hours care has been reorganised, GPs and other out of hospital doctors are often still involved in helping provide cover on a rotation. None of this removes the long-term worry about whether providing such rapid and easy access to care is affordable in the long term. A debate that German politicians are unlikely to begin publicly in this election year or any time soon. Germany Nine out of 10 Germans pay 7% of their pre-tax salary into statutory health insurance, matched by their employers Pensioners and the short-term unemployed also contribute, children are covered by their parents and the federal government compensates for the rest The highest earners, civil servants and the self-employed have private insurance but use it to access the same doctors and hospitals There are more hospital beds, and doctors per patients than in the UK, and you can go directly to see a specialist based in the community Germans also pay a smaller amount into long-term care insurance, but families have to pay a significant amount for social care UK In every part of the UK, the NHS is paid for out of general taxation and the proportion of public money allocated to it is a matter of policy for each of the devolved governments Patients have direct access to a GP, but have to be referred to see a specialist, who mainly work in hospitals, with the exception of some specialities like psychiatry There are waiting targets, but for some routine operations patients can face waits of many months Social care is means tested and access is increasingly restricted to those with the highest level of need.  There is no insurance to cover for old age care The lessons for the UK are that money on its own is not the only solution, although it does ease pressure in the system considerably. Finding better co-ordinated ways of looking after patients, often elderly, with the highest health needs is a priority. And in Germany, despite the long-term care insurance, families still have to contribute a significant amount to looking after older people. However, there is a mechanism for sustainable funding for social care that is very different from the significant reductions in care budgets seen in the UK.

"The authorities at a national park in India protect the wildlife by shooting suspected poachers dead. But has the war against poaching gone too far? Kaziranga National Park is an incredible story of conservation success. There were just a handful of Indian one-horned rhinoceros left when the park was set up a century ago in Assam, in India's far east. Now there are more than 2,400 - two-thirds of the entire world population. This is where David Attenborough's team came to film for Planet Earth II. William and Catherine, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, came here last year. But the way the park protects the animals is controversial. Its rangers have been given the kind of powers to shoot and kill normally only conferred on armed forces policing civil unrest. This video can not be played Entire villages are being destroyed to make way for extended national parks At one stage the park rangers were killing an average of two people every month - more than 20 people a year.  Indeed, in 2015 more people were shot dead by park guards than rhinos were killed by poachers. Innocent villagers, mostly tribal people, have been caught up in the conflict. Rhinos need protection.  Rhino horn can fetch very high prices in Vietnam and China where it is sold as a miracle cure for everything from cancer to erectile dysfunction.  Street vendors charge as much as$6,000 for 100g- making it considerably more expensive than gold. Indian rhinos have smaller horns than those of African rhinos, but reportedly they are marketed as being far more potent. But how far should we go to protect these endangered animals? I ask two guards what they were told to do if they encountered poachers in the park. ""The instruction is whenever you see the poachers or hunters, we should start our guns and hunt them,"" Avdesh explains without hesitation. ""You shoot them?"" I ask. ""Yah, yah.  Fully ordered to shoot them.  Whenever you see the poachers or any people during night-time we are ordered to shoot them."" Avdesh says he has shot at people twice in the four years he has been a guard, but has never killed anybody. He knows, however, there are unlikely to be any consequences for him if he did. The government has granted the guards at Kaziranga extraordinary powers that give them considerable protection against prosecution if they shoot and kill people in the park. Critics say guards like Avdesh and Jibeshwar are effectively being told to carry out ""extrajudicial executions"". Getting figures for how many people are killed in the park is surprisingly difficult. ""We don't keep each and every account,"" says a senior official in India's Forest Department, which oversees the country's national parks. Guards like Avdesh and Jibeshwar have considerable powers The director of the park, Dr Satyendra Singh, is based at the park's impressive colonial-era headquarters. He talks about the difficulties of tackling poachers in the park, explaining that the poaching gangs recruit local people to help them get into the park but that the actual ""shooters"" - the men who kill the rhinos - tend to come from neighbouring states. He says the term ""shoot-on-sight"" does not accurately describe how he orders the forest rangers to deal with suspected poachers.

But if they resort to firing we have to kill them. First we try to arrest them, so that we get the information, what are the linkages, who are others in the gang?"" Dr Singh reveals that just in the past three years, 50 poachers have been killed. He says it reflects how many people in the local community have been lured into the trade as rhino horn prices have risen.  As many as 300 locals are involved in poaching, he believes. For the people who live around Kaziranga the rising death toll has become a major issue. Kaziranga is densely populated, like the rest of India.  Many of the communities here are tribal groups that have lived in or alongside the forest for centuries, collecting firewood as well as herbs and other plants from it.  They say increasing numbers of innocent villagers are being shot. In one of the villages that borders the park live Kachu Kealing and his wife.  Their son, Goanburah, was shot by forest guards in December 2013. The only picture they have of him is a fuzzy reproduction of the young man's face. This video can not be played Kaziranga National Park in India is home to rhinos, elephants and tigers Goanburah had been looking after the family's two cows.  His father believes they strayed into the park and his son - who had severe learning difficulties - went in to try and find them.  It is an easy mistake to make.  There are no fences or signs marking the edge of the park, it just merges seamlessly into the surrounding countryside and fields. The park authorities say guards shot Goanburah inside the forest reserve when he did not respond to a warning. ""He could barely do up his own trousers or his shoes,"" his father says, ""everyone knew him in the area because he was so disabled."" Kachu Kealing does not believe there is any action he can take now, especially given the unusual protection park guards have from prosecution.  ""I haven't filed a court case.  I'm a poor man, I can't afford to take them on."" Kachu Kealing says his disabled son was only looking after the family's cows Conservation efforts in India tend to focus on protecting a few emblematic species.  The fight to preserve them is stacked high with patriotic sentiment. Rhinos and tigers have become potent national symbols. Add to this the fact that Kaziranga is the region's principal tourist attraction - its 170,000 or more annual visitors spend good money here - and it is easy to see why the park feels political pressure to tackle its poaching problem head on. In 2013, when the number of rhinos killed by poachers more than doubled to 27, local politicians demanded action.  The then head of the park was happy to oblige. MK Yadava wrote a report which detailed his strategy for tackling poaching in Kaziranga.  He proposed there should be no unauthorised entry whatsoever.  Anyone found within the park, he said, ""must obey or be killed"". ""Kill the unwanted,"" should be the guiding principle for the guards, he recommended. Heexplained his belief,externalthat environmental crimes, including poaching, are more serious that murder.  ""They erode,"" he said, ""the very root of existence of all civilizations on this earth silently."" And he backed up his tough words with action, putting this uncompromising doctrine into practice in the park. The numbers of people killed rose dramatically. From 2013 to 2014 the number of alleged poachers shot dead in the park leapt from five to 22. In 2015 Kaziranga killed more people in the park than poachers killed rhinos - 23 people lost their lives compared to just 17 rhinos. And, as the park's battle against poaching gathered in intensity, there were to be other casualties. In July last year, seven-year-old Akash Orang was making his way home along the main track through the village, which borders the park. His voice falters as he recounts what happened next. ""I was coming back from the shop. The forest guards were shouting, 'Rhinoceros! Rhinoceros!'"" He pauses.  ""Then they suddenly shot me."" The gunshot blasted away most of the calf muscle on his right leg.  The injuries were so serious he had to be rushed to Assam's main hospital five hours away. He was there for five months and had dozens of operations but, despite the hospital's efforts, Akash can still barely walk. His father, Dilip Orang, bends down and removes the bandage from the boy's leg to display the wound.  His leg appears to be stripped of its skin - the calf muscle is bunched into tight ball. It doesn't flex. ""They took the muscle from here and grafted it here,"" he says. ""But it hasn't worked very well. Just look at it."" Akash has not fully recovered and has to be carried to the shop by his brother It is clear just how terrible his injuries are when Akash gets up to move out of the sun.  He can barely limp the few feet into the shade.  His older brother now has to carry him to the local shop. ""He has changed,"" Dilip says. ""He used to be cheerful.  He isn't any more. In the night he wakes up in pain and cries for his mother."" The park admits it made a terrible mistake.  It paid all his medical expenses and gave the family almost 200,000 rupees ($3,000; Â£2,400) in compensation.  Not much given the scale of Akash's injuries, says his father, who worries whether his son will ever make a living. The crippling of Akash led to a huge outcry from villagers.  It was the culmination of long-simmering disquiet over the mounting death toll in the park. Hundreds marched on the park headquarters. In a house a short walk from the park HQ, human rights campaigner Pranab Doley, himself a member of a local tribe, pulls out a bag stuffed with paperwork.  He has made a series of requests under India's Right to Information Act and says the replies show that many cases aren't followed up properly. ""In most cases you don't have things like the magisterial inquiry, the forensic report, the post mortem reports,"" he says, rifling through the stacks of paper. The park says that it's not responsible for investigating the killings, and whatever action it does take follows the law. Even so, some of Mr Doley's documents reveal a surprising lack of information. He pulls out a table listing deaths in one of the park's four districts.  It shows nine suspected poachers killed in one year, six of whom are recorded as unidentified. The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge have visited the park And there are other indications that careful investigation is not a priority when it comes to wildlife crime in Assam. The park says that in the last three years just two people have been prosecuted for poaching - a striking contrast to the 50 people who were shot dead in the park in the same period. The park justifies the number of deaths, saying the figures are so high because the heavily armed poaching gangs engage guards in deadly shoot-outs.  However, the statistics indicate that these ""encounters"" are more one-sided than the park suggests. Once again, firm figures are hard to come by, but according to the reports we can find just one park guard has been killed by poachers in the past 20 years, compared with 106 people shot dead by guards over the same period. Mr Doley argues the high number of deaths is because, at least in part, of the legal protection the park and its guards enjoy. ""This kind of impunity is dangerous,"" he says. ""It is creating animosity between the park and people living in the periphery of the park."" That animosity is deepened because so many of the local community are tribal people who claim they and their ancient way of life are - like the animals the park is trying to protect - also endangered. Their cause has been taken up bySurvival International,external, a London-based charity.  It argues that the rights of tribal people around the park are being sacrificed in the name of wildlife protection. ""The park is being run with utmost brutality,"" says Sophie Grig, the lead campaigner. ""There is no jury, there's no judge, there's no questioning.  And the terrifying thing is that there are plans to roll [out] the shoot at sight policy across [the] whole of India."" Villagers are angry about evictions Her strong language is testimony perhaps to the concern felt by activists like her that traditional communities might be sacrificed in the name of wildlife protection. She says some of the biggest animal conservation charities in the world, including the World Wildlife Fund, have turned a blind eye to the activities of the park. ""WWF describes itself as a close partner of the Assam Forest Department,"" says Ms Grig.  ""They've been providing equipment and funds to the forest department.  Survival has repeatedly asked them to speak out against this shoot-on-sight policy and extrajudicial executions which they have so far failed to do."" According to the WWF India website,it has funded,externalcombat and ambush training for Kaziranga's guards and has provided specialist equipment including night vision goggles for the park's anti-poaching effort. ""Nobody is comfortable with killing people,"" says Dr Dipankar Ghose, who helps run much of WWF's conservation programme in India. ""What is needed is on the ground protection. The poaching has to stop."" The bulk of WWF's funding comes from individual donations. So how would the WWF's donors feel about the organisation's involvement with a park facing allegations of killing, maiming and torturing?  Dr Ghose does not answer the question directly. ""Well, as I said, we are working towards it.  We want the whole thing to reduce - we don't want poaching to happen, and the idea is to reduce it involving all our partners. It is not just the Kaziranga authorities but also the enforcement agencies, also the local people. So I think the main thing is to work with the local people."" The park is popular with both Indian and foreign visitors And there are plenty of conservationists that accept that, in some circumstances, there must be a tough response to poachers. ""No park would exist in India without having regular anti-poaching operations,"" says naturalist and writer Valmik Thapar. ""Anti-poaching is an essential element of conservation."" ""There are some that do it well. There are some that fail miserablyâ¦ and they don't have any tigers. So there are some tiger reserves in India, that actually don't have any tigers at all because they have all been poached. ""In some exceptional cases you can use the gun against the gun, but in other places in India you need to use community intelligence, because the local community are the eyes and ears of the forest."" Three months after Akash was shot and villagers marched on park headquarters once again - this time to protest allegations of torture. Mono Bora was sitting at a roadside cafe when he was picked up by forest guards. He claims he was punched in the face repeatedly as he was driven to park headquarters. Once inside the offices the questioning became even more violent. ""They gave me electric shocks here on my knees, and here on my elbows. And here on my groin too."" Mr Bora describes how he was tied in a stress position to bamboo staves. Village leader Biren Koch believes innocent people have been targted ""They kept on hitting me,"" he says. The ordeal lasted for three hours until finally his assailants became convinced they had the wrong man. Kaziranga confirmed it did bring Mono Bora in for questioning but categorically denies any harm came to him, adding that it ""never uses electric shock during interrogation"". The chief of Mono Bora's village picked him up from the park headquarters.  Biren Kotch says he did not believe Mr Bora had any involvement in poaching. ""How can they justify torture?"" But it isn't just the anti-poaching effort that threatens local people. Big wild animals like tigers and rhinos need lots of space. To accommodate them India is planning a massive expansion of its network of national of parks. It is great news for conservation, but the plans involve relocating 900 villages.  More than 200,000 people will have to leave their homes, it is estimated. Kaziranga will double in size and an eviction order has been issued. State police recently evicted two villages amid chaotic scenes in which stone-throwing villagers were beaten with batons and fired on by police. Two people - a father of two and a young female student - were killed. Sophia Khatumâs husband was shot dead by police in the demonstration against the evictions Diggers were brought in and the national park provided a team of elephants to help raze every home to the ground. In the wreckage of the village critics might see more evidence of a brutal approach to conservation.  The problem is the park's tactics appear to have worked.  Since the crackdown in the park began in 2013 the numbers of rhinos poached has fallen back.  Last year just 18 rhinos were killed. But the important question is what the long term cost will be, says Pranab Doley, the tribal rights campaigner.  He believes the park's behaviour betrays a misguided attitude to conservation.  ""That's what their policy and philosophy is - move the people out of here and create pure pristine forest."" He says the park is on a collision course with local tribal people.  If it gets its way, he says, it will destroy the ancient culture of tribal people like him, but could also end up frustrating its own efforts to protect its animals. ""Without the people taking care of the forest, no forest department will be able to protect Kaziranga. It's the human shield which is protecting Kaziranga."" Of course, there's no arguing that endangered species must be protected and preserved, but the costs on the human community need to be taken into account too.
