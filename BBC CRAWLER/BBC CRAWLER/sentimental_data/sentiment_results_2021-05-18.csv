"Ministers hope the scheme will create opportunities for a younger, more eco-savvy, generation to own farmland Older farmers in England will be paid to retire under a UK government scheme to bring new blood into the trade. The average farmer could receive a lump sum payment of Â£50,000 - capped at Â£100,000 for farmers with most land. It is part of a massive overhaul of farm grants, incentivising farmers to protect the environment. Some older farmers are resistant to new ""green"" methods, Environment Secretary George Eustice believes, and he wants them to move on. Next steps in England's rural revolution unveiled âRadicalâ changes to farming in post-Brexit plan UK farmers to need 'thousands of foreign workers' Currently, under the old EU system, farmers receive grants based largely on the amount of land they farm. The average farmer currently receives about Â£21,000 in grants - althoughthose who own large amounts of land, such as the Queen, have been receiving more than half a million pounds each year. Farmers in Wales are expected to be able to benefit from a similar scheme to the England plans announced by Mr Eustice. Plans in Scotland and Northern Ireland will be different. Mr Eustice says the EU's grants system encourages some farmers ""to coast, to take no risks"" and hold on to their land in order to collect the subsidy. Hence the need for help for older farmers to move on. At the Oxford Farming Conference earlier this year, Mr Eustice said some veteran farmers were ""standing in the way of change"" and coasting along on state subsidies. He said: ""I understand the burden of expectation that can exist to loyally continue the family tradition (of farming) and how this sometimes stands in the way of change."" But, he said: ""A fresh perspective can make a world of difference. New entrants are the lifeblood of any vibrant industry and farming is no exception."" A spokesman for the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra), told BBC News: ""There's evidence that farmers who wish to leave farming can find it difficult to generate capital to do so. ""So, a lump sum payment could help contribute to the costs of moving somewhere new or moving into an alternative sector."" Nearly four in 10 UK farmers are over the age of 65, with an average age of 59. The agriculture sector accounts for about 9 per cent of the UK's annual greenhouse gas emissions The Tenant Farmers' Association sought the views of 360 farmers and reported that three-quarters of them were seriously interested in the proposed retirement scheme, which is launched in a consultation today. The organisation's chief executive, George Dunn, told BBC News he supported the plan for a lump sum for farmers based on the grants they would have received if they'd stayed in business. But he warned: ""The government have got to make it easy enough for people to take up the scheme - not drown them in bureaucracy. ""The payments on their own won't be enough - but when you tie in other factors such as selling livestock, some farmers will want to take it up. ""For people on larger holdings, it won't be very attractive - but a lot of owner-occupiers might find it attractive."" At the launch of today's consultation, Mr Eustice explained: ""We need to address the twin challenges of helping new entrants fulfil their dream and gain access to land, while also helping an older generation retire with dignity. ""Our exit scheme will offer farmers real incentive to confront what can often be a difficult decision and will help them clear bills and settle debts."" A spokesperson for the National Farmers' Union (NFU) said: ""As our agricultural support is overhauled, farm businesses across the country will be making life-changing decisions about the future of their farm."" They added: ""We want to see a fair transition which allows farmers who are considering leaving the industry to have sufficient time and information to make those life-changing decisions."" About Â£3bn of state subsidy is paid to UK farmers each year, but this will be phased out. An estimated 61% of farm income comes from subsidy. Under the new post-Brexit scheme, grants will be used to incentivise so-called ""public goods"", such as protecting water supplies; holding floodwater on land; capturing carbon in soil and trees, and increasing wildlife. The government believes that younger farmers will be more open to new nature-friendly ideas and more inclined to seek income by diversifying into businesses such as camping or glamping. Clarification 8th March 2022: This article was amended on the day of publication to make clear that the scheme is for older farmers in England and that farmers in Wales are expected to be able to benefit from a similar scheme, while plans in Scotland and Northern Ireland will be different.

"Offering children in some richer countries a coronavirus vaccine before some high-risk people in poorer ones is ""morally wrong"", a group of MPs has been told. Prof Andrew Pollard, who helped develop the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine, said the ""inequity"" of vaccine distribution must change ""urgently"". The US and Canada have made a jab available to children as young as 12. But in many low-income countries those most at risk are yet to be vaccinated. ""The overall aim of a global vaccination programme in a pandemic is to stop people dying,"" said Prof Pollard, director of the Oxford Vaccine Group, who led the trials for the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine. ""I have worked in Nepal and Bangladesh and colleagues there are facing the most appalling circumstances - they're not working in a situation where there's an NHS to support them,"" he told the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Coronavirus. ""It feels completely wrong to be in a situation morally where we are allowing that to happen whilst in many countries vaccines are being rolled out to younger and younger populations at very, very low risk. ""Children have near to zero risk of severe disease or death."" The Pfizer vaccine, which has been approved in the US and Canada, has completed trials in adolescents. And a number of other Covid vaccines are being tested on this age group and younger. But Prof Pollard said: ""The main issue at the moment is to try and make sure the doses go to those in greatest need. ""This is a global problem which impacts our economies and puts pressure on health systems."" Studies show over-50s, people with certain health conditions and healthcare workers are most likely to become seriously ill or die from coronavirus - but many in parts of Africa and South Asia are still waiting for a vaccine. Campaigners warn supply shortages are a huge concern. Covax, the international scheme to ensure equal access to Covid vaccines, is currently short of 140 million doses, after a disruption in supply from India. Unicef and the World Health Organization have both called on wealthier countries to share their surplus supplies, as some have ordered enough to vaccinate their populations many times over. A Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office spokesperson said Â£548 million has been provided to deliver more than a billion vaccines to more than 70 countries. They added the UK will share the ""majority of any future surplus coronavirus vaccines from our supply with the COVAX pool, when these are available"". India's Covid crisis hits vaccine-sharing scheme Prof Pollard said his key message to the government would be to act with ""absolute urgency"" or ""many millions could die between now and September"". ""We can't wait until later this year to make decisions, he said. ""It has to be now that we look at redistribution and how we get doses to countries that have poor access at the moment - and that is through Covax."" UK pledges surplus Covid vaccines to poorer nations Another witness told the MPs' panel richer countries were ""hoarding doses"" and he feared they would do the same with potential booster shots in the future. But the production of vaccine in low- and middle-income countries would prevent this. ""We hear from so many manufacturers in places like Pakistan and Bangladesh and Indonesia - they're ready, they've got some capacity,"" Prof Gavin Yamey, director of the Centre for Policy Impact in Global Health, at Duke University, in the US, said. ""It's fine to continue donating - but there has to be a long-term vision. ""This pandemic could be with us for years. ""Is it really just going to be charity - drip, drip, drip of a few doses from rich countries? ""That's not a long-term vision."" LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area?

"The government has no plan to meet the ""huge challenge"" of persuading motorists to switch to electric vehicles, MPs have warned. The Public Accounts Committee said the official target of banning the sale of new petrol and diesel cars from 2030 could be missed without urgent action. It also argued that electric vehicles were still too expensive and there were not enough charging points. The government said it was on track to meet its targets. A spokesman said it was investing Â£2.8bn to help the car industry and drivers make the switch to electric. Government to speed up UK climate change target What will happen to all the dead car batteries? Road and rail building plans under review Sales of electric vehicles are by far the fastest growing segment of the car market, but they still only account for only 11% of new registrations. The committee warned that this would not get to 100% unless prices fell and charging infrastructure was installed quickly. Only 13 electric car models on sale in the UK at the moment cost less than Â£30,000, its report said. It pointed out that the majority of charging took place at home and claimed the government had not focused enough on helping people who do not have off-street parking. The committee also said the government needed to develop the skilled workforce and electric power infrastructure needed to support the transition. Its chairwoman, Labour MP Meg Hillier, said the UK had ""a mountain to climb"" to meet its targets. Challenges included making the car industry ""environmentally and socially compliant"", but getting the government ""wean itself off carbon revenues"" could be the biggest obstacle, she added. ""What we've got is a government throwing up a few signs around base camp, and no let-up in demand for oversized, petrol-guzzling vehicles,"" Ms Hillier said. But the government said it had a ""highly ambitious and world-leading approach to increasing the uptake of zero-emission cars"". A spokesperson said the ""progress we're making in this area will help us to meet our targets"". The government had allocated Â£1.3bn over the next four years to support the roll-out of charging points on motorways and major A roads, in homes and businesses and on streets, they added. The cost of electric vehicles would fall as production scaled up around the world, the spokesperson claimed. The RAC motoring group said it expected sales to grow further as new models came out. It called for the government to look at ""ways to incentivise take-up"", adding that the plug-in grant - under which motorists are given help in purchasing zero-emissions vehicles - was not guaranteed to continue beyond 2023. Sales of new hybrid vehicles are to be banned from 2035, under government plans.

"Charles Grodin won several awards for his parts in TV and film productions Charles Grodin, an American actor whose comic roles in films such as Midnight Run and Beethoven brought smiles to faces for decades, has died at 86. Grodin died at his home in Wilton, Connecticut on Tuesday, the New York Times newspaper reported. The actor's son, Nicholas, told the newspaper his cause of death was bone marrow cancer. Known for his dry wit, Grodin was a familiar face in Hollywood comedies and prime-time talk shows in the US. Tributes have been made on social media, includinga tweet from fellow American actor Steve Martin,external, who described Grodin as ""one of the funniest people I ever met"". Charles Grodin had a career in acting, writing and comedy that spanned decades Born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, Grodin dropped his studies at the University of Miami to launch a career in acting. It was a decision that paid off in the 1960s, when he started to land parts in plays on Broadway, including his debut in a production of Tchin-Tchin, which starred Anthony Quinn. He soon moved to TV and film, building his profile with a small role in Rosemary's Baby, a 1968 psychological horror film written and directed by Roman Polanski. But the 1970s was the decade Grodin's career really took off. A series of roles in films including Catch-22 in 1970 and The Heartbreak Kid in 1972 cemented his status as one of Hollywood's go-to comedy actors. For his role in The Heartbreak Kid - in which he plays an unlucky-in-love sporting goods salesman - he was nominated for a Golden Globe Award for best actor. The fact he didn't win the award may not have bothered him too much. ""I never complain about anything, because I'm aware of what's going on around me, and I'm also aware that there are a lot of very gifted people that never even get a job in show business,"" Grodin told the AV Club website in a 2009 interview. ""It's just because they can't handle the rejection, and I can handle it, and I'm used to it."" Grodin played an angry dad in the 1992 film Beethoven Grodin had his share of success as well. He won best actor at the 1988 Valladolid International Film Festival for his role in Midnight Run. In that film, a 1988 action-comedy, he co-starred with Robert De Niro as an accountant who embezzled millions from a mob boss. Grodin also won an Emmy as a co-writer on a 1977 Paul Simon TV special, hosted his own 1990s chat show, and was a regular fixture on shows hosted by Johnny Carson, David Letterman and Jay Leno. One of Grodin's most well-known roles was in the popular family film Beethoven in 1992. He plays a short-tempered dad who, to his fury, is bedevilled by a slobbering, accident-prone dog.

"Serious patient safety issues are being buried in confidential hospital reports, BBC Panorama has found. Freedom of Information requests revealed 111 reports, written by medical royal colleges, which NHS trusts have a duty to share. Eighty reports were given to the BBC but only 26 had been shared in full with regulators, and 16 published. The Department of Health would not comment on whether it might change the law to ensure publication. Since the 2015 Morecambe Bay maternity scandal in which 11 babies and a mother died, NHS Trusts are supposed to publish summaries of external reviews, and share them with the regulator. Dr Bill Kirkup said the findings were ""a great disappointment"" An earlier review into the hospital had previously identified concerns but had not been made public. Dr Bill Kirkup, who led a 2015 investigation into the Morecambe Bay scandal, said Panorama's findings were a ""great disappointment"". ""People should know that there is something that is important enough to be looked at and they should know what the results of that scrutiny are. ""I can't understand what the rationale would be for withholding the existence of a report or the findings of the report. These are important matters of accountability in the public service."" James Titcombe, who became a patient safety campaigner after his baby son Joshua died due to failures of care at Morecambe Bay, said by not publishing reports ""there are possibly risks out there that the regulator is unaware of, and ultimately those risks can have tragic consequences"". Freedom of Information (FoI) requests were sent to all NHS Trusts in the UK requesting any Royal College reviews of services in the last five years. The colleges set standards of care and can be commissioned to review how a health care provider is performing. Royal college service reviews Of the 80 reports released to the BBC, just 16 are in the public domain, and only 26 were shared in full with the regulators. In another 22 cases the regulator was only aware of the review or had only seen part of it. Sixty-five of the 80 contained potential or actual patient safety concerns. Though the BBC had been told about 111 reports, the Royal Colleges told Panorama they had carried out about 260 reviews in the same period. Prof Helen Stokes-Lampard, who chairs the Academy of Medical Royal Colleges, said she was ""dismayed"" summaries of reports were not being made public, and it had published guidance in 2016 saying reports dealing with safety or care concerns should be made public. ""If things are not being shared, and if that has implications for patient safety, that must be put right. The fact that a review is done should never be secret and indeed a summary of the findings should always be published"". The vasculitis department at the Royal Liverpool Hospital treats people with a disease affecting the blood vessels. In 2015, after concerns were raised by other clinicians, the Royal College of Physicians (RCP) was called in. The college recommended there should be an audit of patients treated during the previous two years ""without delay"" to ensure they were on the correct treatment. FoI requests reveal there were 400 patients under the care of the unit at that point. But 18 months after the review, less than a quarter had been checked. Out of a group of 26 who were on powerful medications, two were found to have been given them ""inappropriately"", four were given ""possibly excessive"" doses and three had died while suffering side effects from the drugs. BBC Panorama has seen emails from the RCP threatening to tell the regulator, the Care Quality Commission (CQC), if the audit wasn't completed, but it did not follow through. In addition, the CQC was never told by the hospital or the college about the concerns or given the full report. Instead it was only told a review had happened. The CQC said if it had known an audit was required, it would have monitored the outcomes. And the RCP said it was ""satisfied that the trust made reasonable attempts to complete the audits"" but was ""very disappointed with the speed of response and progress"", adding that the trust ""had a clear obligation to share serious ongoing concerns with patients and the regulator"".

"Serious patient safety issues are being buried in confidential hospital reports, BBC Panorama has found. Freedom of Information requests revealed 111 reports, written by medical royal colleges, which NHS trusts have a duty to share. Eighty reports were given to the BBC but only 26 had been shared in full with regulators, and 16 published. The Department of Health would not comment on whether it might change the law to ensure publication. Since the 2015 Morecambe Bay maternity scandal in which 11 babies and a mother died, NHS Trusts are supposed to publish summaries of external reviews, and share them with the regulator. Dr Bill Kirkup said the findings were ""a great disappointment"" An earlier review into the hospital had previously identified concerns but had not been made public. Dr Bill Kirkup, who led a 2015 investigation into the Morecambe Bay scandal, said Panorama's findings were a ""great disappointment"". ""People should know that there is something that is important enough to be looked at and they should know what the results of that scrutiny are. ""I can't understand what the rationale would be for withholding the existence of a report or the findings of the report. These are important matters of accountability in the public service."" James Titcombe, who became a patient safety campaigner after his baby son Joshua died due to failures of care at Morecambe Bay, said by not publishing reports ""there are possibly risks out there that the regulator is unaware of, and ultimately those risks can have tragic consequences"". Freedom of Information (FoI) requests were sent to all NHS Trusts in the UK requesting any Royal College reviews of services in the last five years. The colleges set standards of care and can be commissioned to review how a health care provider is performing. Royal college service reviews Of the 80 reports released to the BBC, just 16 are in the public domain, and only 26 were shared in full with the regulators. In another 22 cases the regulator was only aware of the review or had only seen part of it. Sixty-five of the 80 contained potential or actual patient safety concerns. Though the BBC had been told about 111 reports, the Royal Colleges told Panorama they had carried out about 260 reviews in the same period. Prof Helen Stokes-Lampard, who chairs the Academy of Medical Royal Colleges, said she was ""dismayed"" summaries of reports were not being made public, and it had published guidance in 2016 saying reports dealing with safety or care concerns should be made public. ""If things are not being shared, and if that has implications for patient safety, that must be put right. The fact that a review is done should never be secret and indeed a summary of the findings should always be published"". The vasculitis department at the Royal Liverpool Hospital treats people with a disease affecting the blood vessels. In 2015, after concerns were raised by other clinicians, the Royal College of Physicians (RCP) was called in. The college recommended there should be an audit of patients treated during the previous two years ""without delay"" to ensure they were on the correct treatment. FoI requests reveal there were 400 patients under the care of the unit at that point. But 18 months after the review, less than a quarter had been checked. Out of a group of 26 who were on powerful medications, two were found to have been given them ""inappropriately"", four were given ""possibly excessive"" doses and three had died while suffering side effects from the drugs. BBC Panorama has seen emails from the RCP threatening to tell the regulator, the Care Quality Commission (CQC), if the audit wasn't completed, but it did not follow through. In addition, the CQC was never told by the hospital or the college about the concerns or given the full report. Instead it was only told a review had happened. The CQC said if it had known an audit was required, it would have monitored the outcomes. And the RCP said it was ""satisfied that the trust made reasonable attempts to complete the audits"" but was ""very disappointed with the speed of response and progress"", adding that the trust ""had a clear obligation to share serious ongoing concerns with patients and the regulator"". The Royal Liverpool Hospital said it was ""committed to providing safe and excellent care"" and that the recommendations identified within the RCP's 2015 report have since been ""successfully implemented, or are part of longer-term actions currently in progress"". The CQC does not currently have the legal power to compel trusts to share the reports or make the trust implement recommendations. Prof Ted Baker, the CQC's chief inspector of hospitals, said: ""Both hospital trusts and the professional bodies undertaking invited reviews have a responsibility to ensure that any serious patient safety issues raised in an invited review are shared with CQC.

"UK farmers have sounded the alarm over reports the government plans a trade deal with Australia that would make its food and farming imports cheaper. The move is being considered as part of a free trade pact with Australia the UK government hopes will be a springboard for similar pacts with other countries. But UK farming unions have warned of ""irreversible damage"" from a bad deal. There is speculation the Cabinet is split over the move, and Labour has accused the government of a ""sell-out"". As with many countries, farming imports from Australia face tariffs - or taxes - making lamb and beef, for example, more expensive. But in a post-Brexit world, the UK government is keen to strike free trade deals and has now indicated that farmers may have to prepare for the lowering of tariffs on agricultural imports. The Department for International Trade (DIT) would not be drawn directly on reports it is willing to concede to zero tariffs in return for an Australia deal. However, it said a deal would be ""an important stepping stone"" to joining the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a sprawling trade group that includes New Zealand, Chile, Japan, Vietnam, as well as Australia. A deal would ""allow UK farmers even greater access to growing consumer markets in Asia"", the DIT said, adding that it would not allow importers to undercut the farming industry or food standards. However, the National Farmers' Union warned that its members will struggle to compete if zero-tariff trade on lamb and beef goes ahead. NFU head Minette Batters said access to the UK market should not be given away lightly NFU president Minette Batters said: ""We know that if we're to open up the opportunities of new markets overseas for UK farmers, we will have to offer greater access to our own markets in return. ""However, this trade-off needs to be balanced, and we need to make sure concessions to our hugely valuable home market are not given away lightly. ""There is a very real risk that, if we get it wrong, UK farming will suffer irreversible damage rather than flourish in the way we all desire, to the detriment of our environment, our food security and our rural communities."" Rift? Farmers' concerns are reportedly shared by some members of the Cabinet. The Financial Times reported that Environment Secretary George Eustice and Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove are at loggerheads with International Trade Secretary Liz Truss and Brexit minister Lord Frost over granting tariff-free access to Australian, and possibly New Zealand, farmers. Â£1bn UK-India deals to create 6,000 UK jobs - PM Asked about the rift by the Press Association, Mr Eustice said: ""I'm not going to get into discussions that are going on in government about individual trade agreements. ""In any discussion on any part of government policy, and trade agreements are no exception, there's a discussion and there's a consensus. ""At the moment there's a very clear consensus in government that we want to do a trade agreement with countries like Australia, but obviously on the right terms."" However, sources did not deny to the BBC that there were Cabinet divisions over the issue. Emily Thornberry, Labour's shadow international trade secretary, accused Ms Truss of selling out British farmers. ""It's perfectly normal that the Australian government should try to get the best possible deal for its agricultural mega-corporations,"" she said. ""But British family farmers have a right to expect that Liz Truss will do the same for them, not sell out their livelihoods for the price of a quick trade deal, and a cheap headline at the G7 summit."" Ms Truss was hoping to secure an Australia deal ahead of the G7 summit in June. She is about to start official trade talks with Canada and Mexico, adding to those under way with India and New Zealand. Trade deals are about countries trying to secure the best for their businesses and people. When working down the menu of issues, the hardest to digest - typically, agriculture -  is normally left to the last. Australia aims to get tariffs and quotas dropped for all goods, which on the UK government's own estimates could boost imports from that country by 83% - mainly due to beef and lamb. That's worrying for some farmers - but the government says any liberalisation would take years, and Australia isn't taking full advantage of the tariff free quotas it's got now. But the key is what it signals for other trade deals and policy. An agreement with Australia will likely be the first one struck by the UK with a nation with which it didn't have an agreement while part of the EU. And Trade Secretary Liz Truss is keen to strike it fast, as a springboard for membership of a wider trans-pacific trading bloc.

"Israel's military is preparing for an ""intensive"" night of strikes in Gaza, Israeli media report Air strikes and rocket fire claimed more lives on Tuesday In one incident, rockets fired from Gaza into Israel killed two workers from Thailand Following attacks from militants Israel closes a crossing into Gaza which opened briefly to allow in aid Palestinians and Israeli Arabs have been holding a general strike President Biden has joined calls for a ceasefire between Israel and Palestinian militants The violence has entered its second week and killed more than 200 people in Gaza and 12 in Israel Edited by Rebecca Seales We're now pausing our live coverage of the ongoing Israel-Gaza conflict - many thanks for staying with us. To recap, here are the key developments from the past 24 hours: Family and friends attend the funeral of Yigal Yehoshua, a Jewish man killed in clashes with Israeli Arabs The funeral has taken place of a Jewish man who died after sustaining serious injuries during violence between Israeli Arabs and Jews in Israel's central city of Lod last week. Mourners attended the service for Yigal Yehoshua, 56, who was hit in the head by a large rock or brick thrown by protesters while driving home in Lod, a city not far from Tel Aviv, on 11 May. Yehoshua was taken to hospital for treatment, but later died of his injuries. A mourner drapes himself with an Israeli flag At least 12 people were reportedly injured in the clashes that day, which followed the funeral of an Israeli Arab man who died during unrest in the city a day earlier. The BBC's Rushdi Abualouf in Gaza shared this video showing collapsed buildings on a major street there. Trees line one side of the road, while the other is scarred by rubble and twisted metal.

The Palestinian health ministry said 72 Palestinians are receiving treatment for injuries Two more Palestinians have died after they were hit by live fire during clashes with Israeli security forces in the West Bank, the Palestinian health ministry has said. The ministry said three Palestinians have now died and 72 were injured - five critically - after today's unrest in the area. The violence came as Palestinians across the West Bank and in east Jerusalem observed a general strike in support of those under bombardment in the Gaza Strip. Israeli's military is yet to comment on the three deaths. But in an earlier statement, the Israeli army said its soldiers ""responded with fire"" after ""a number of rioters fired extensively"" at them near Ramallah. ""Two soldiers were injured in their legs, and were evacuated to a hospital for further medical treatment,"" the military said. BBC OS The BBC OS radio show on the World Service has
been speaking to people across Israel and Gaza to hear their stories and
experiences. Today they spoke to a Jewish
Israeli mother in the city of Lod, which has seen unrest and violence. Katy Berman, a mother of seven and teacher: ""I personally did not leave the house for 4 days, I was so
scared, scared I would get a rock thrown through my car window, scared someone
would ambush me... ""When I met my (Arab) neighbour we spoke about how we felt
the night before when we were woke up umpteen times by the sirens. Because
rockets are coming, and on top of the rioting weâre having rockets sent over by
Hamas in Gaza. So we spoke as two mothers you know, âhow did you sleep at
night?â and âhow did your kids sleep at night', and how scary is it. ""My older kids are very worried about the situation,
theyâre worried in the way they wish they were here and could help and do
something. With my younger kids, they donât really know whatâs going onâ¦.. Iâm
not sure what to tell them, Iâm not sure what theyâll understand, how theyâll
go in the street â I donât want them to be scared."" Israeli reports say the military has issued new safety rules for the West Bank Israel's military has enacted emergency security rules in parts of the West Bank, reports say. The Times of Israel newspaper said,externalthe military had declared a âspecial situationâ in several areas, citing the threat of rocket fire. It said the declaration was not related to unrest in the West Bank, which has seen violent confrontations between Palestinians and Israeli police today. Under the rules, schools, universities and workplaces will only be allowed to remain open if they are in the vicinity of a protective area,according to another Israeli newspaper, the Jerusalem Post,external. The paper said Elkana, Karnei Shomron, and Oranit were among the areas where these rules would apply. It did not specify when they would come into force or how long they would apply for. The EU's foreign affairs chief, Josep Borrell, called for an ""immediate cessation of all violence"" Hungary has refused to back a European Union statement that called for a ceasefire between Israel and the Palestinians. Hungary's foreign minister Peter Szijjarto dismissed the EU's statement on Israel as ""one-sided"". ""I have a general problem with these European statements on Israel,"" Szijjarto told the AFP news agency. He said ""these statements do not help, especially not under current circumstances, when the tension is so high."" His comments came after the EU's foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, called for an ""immediate cessation of all violence and the implementation of a ceasefire"". Borrell said the statement was backed by all EU member states except Hungary. In recent years Hungary has been one of Israel's staunchest supporters in Europe. It has blocked several EU efforts to criticise Israeli policies, such as the US move to recognise Jerusalem as Israel's capital. Palestinian militants can move fast inside their underground tunnel network (file photo) Israel's military is preparing to strikemore targets linked to the Palestinian group Hamas's network of underground tunnels,externalin Gaza, the Jerusalem Post reports. The newspaper quotes Israel Defense Forces (IDF) spokesman Brig Gen Hidai Zilberman as describing ""an intensive night ahead of us"" as its operations look to strike ""new locations"". The IDF said it had struck dozens of ""terror targets"" and had already destroyed more than 15km (9.3 miles) of an underground tunnel network belonging to Hamas. Tunnel systems used by Hamas fighters have long been an important target for Israeli air raids. Earlier today, Brig Gen Zilberman told Israel's Army Radio that the IDF was ""not talking about a
ceasefire"", adding: ""We're focused on the firing."" A large blaze has broken out at a paint warehouse in the town of Rafah in Gaza following a reported Israeli strike. Eyewitnesses said a shell had hit the property on Tuesday afternoon, Reuters reports. It is not clear why the warehouse would have been targeted. Images show firefighters tackling the blaze while workers attempt to rescue stored items. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu spoke at an air base Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has reaffirmed his government's commitment to its operations against Palestinian militants in Gaza. Speaking at an air base a short time ago, Netanyahu said Israel would continue striking targets there ""for as long as necessary to restore quiet to the citizens of Israel"". He said Hamas, the militant group that rules Gaza, had ""received blows it did not expect"", setting it back by ""years"". ""Our enemies around us can see what price we exact for attacks against us,"" Netanyahu said. The Times of Israel newspaper said,externalrocket alarms sounded at the base near Beersheba during Netanyahuâs visit. Mustafa Barghouti, the West Bank-based leader of the
Palestinian National Initiative political party, tells BBC World News: âPalestinians
are ready for a ceasefire; itâs Israel that is abstaining from a ceasefire.â Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu wants to end rocket
attacks by Hamas and other Palestinian militant groups in Gaza and says its air
strikes will continue for âas long as it takes in order to
restore calm for all of Israelâs citizensâ. âIf Israel wants to keep shooting and throwing rockets
with their F-16 jet fightersâ¦ and wants Palestinians not to defend themselves, of
course that will not happen,â Mr Barghouti says. âA ceasefire means that nobody
will send rockets - that nobody will shoot on both sides.â This video can not be played Dr Barghouti: Ceasefire needs both sides not to shoot Germany has pledged â¬40m ($48.9m; Â£34.4m) in humanitarian aid for civilians in Gaza. According to the UN more than 52,000 Palestinians have been displaced by the current violence. German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas said he would ""lobby for a better humanitarian supply in Gaza"" at a meeting of EU member states today. He also condemned rocket attacks on Israel from Hamas, and stressed that Israel had the right to defend itself. A Palestinian protester has been killed in clashes with
Israeli security forces on the outskirts of the city of Ramallah, in
the occupied West Bank, according to the Palestinian health ministry. The ministry said the 25-year-old man was shot in the
chest at the entrance to al-Bireh. Another 50 people were
injured, five of them seriously, it added. The Palestinian news agency Wafa reported,externalthat Israeli
forces fired live rounds, rubber-coated bullets and tear gas during a protest against Israelâs air strikes on the Gaza Strip and its actions against
Palestinians elsewhere. Palestinian factions had called for a ""day of rage"". The Israeli military said ""a number of rioters fired extensively"" at its soldiers near Ramallah, and that they ""responded with fire"".
   ""Two soldiers were injured in their legs, and were evacuated to a hospital for further medical treatment,"" it added. There were also clashes between protesters and Israeli forces
in Bethlehem, where the health ministry said nine people were injured, and in occupied East Jerusalem. A Norwegian aid group has been powerfully drawing attention to the deaths of children in the conflict, noting that a number of young people killed in Gaza were directly receiving its help.

""We are devastated to learn that... children we were helping with trauma were bombarded while they were at home and thought they were safe,"" the head of the Norwegian Refugee Council, Jan Egeland, added. At least two Israeli children have been killed by rockets fired from Gaza by Hamas militants since the start of this latest conflict - and Israel says many more are living in fear. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken has denied the US is obstructing diplomacy, after the country refused to back a UN Security Council declaration on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. China has accused the US of hindering the Council's efforts to speak with ""one voice"". But Blinken insists the US is ""engaged in quiet, but very intensive diplomacy"". He said: ""... Would any given action or any given statement actually advance the goal of ending the violence?"" ""If we think, going forward, that there's something, including at the United Nations, that would actually effectively advance the objective, we would be for it,"" he said. The UN Security Council is due to meet for a fourth emergency session later on Tuesday. German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Jordanâs King
Abdullah II have called for a âspeedyâ ceasefire to end the hostilities between
Israel and Palestinian militants in Gaza. Mrs Merkelâs spokesman said
that both leaders had âagreed that initiatives for a speedy ceasefire should be
supported in order to create the conditions for the resumption of political
negotiationsâ. French Prime Minister Jean Castex also called for an
immediate end to the violence and urged
Israel to guarantee unhindered access for aid to Gaza. Egypt has sent 65 tonnes of medical aid to neighbouring Gaza, as the fighting in the region shows no sign of easing. It comes after the UN said at least six hospitals in the territory had been damaged since the conflict erupted more than a week ago. Healthcare and other services have also been disrupted by frequent power cuts. The only coronavirus-testing laboratory in Gaza - which has one of the highest rates of positive tests in the world - was knocked out on Monday. The supplies sent by Egypt include specialist burns treatment materials as well as ""ventilators, oxygen tanks [and] syringes,"" Health Minister Hala Zayed said. Rockets fired from Gaza fly towards Israel (file photo) We earlier posted on reports that Palestinian rockets launched into southern Israel had struck a packaging factory in the Eshkol region and killed two Thai workers. Thailand's foreign ministry has now confirmed that two of its citizens died - while eight others were wounded - in the attack at 14:50 local time (11:50 GMT) some 14km (about nine miles) from the border with Gaza. The two Thai men had been working at the Obad farming estate in Eshkol town, the ministry said. One eyewitness, Adirek Jinseng, a Thai worker at the estate, told the BBC's Thai service that the attack happened as people were resting during their lunch break. ""I heard two explosions in the sky, but there was no warning siren. More than 10 workers then rushed... to hide in the bunkers,"" Adirek said, adding that he saw one person killed at the scene and several others with serious injuries. A senior Thai diplomat in Israel told the BBC that around 4,000 of the country's citizens had been working within a 100km radius of Gaza. Some were relocated to safer areas over the weekend. These Palestinian children fled their homes and sought refuge at a UN-run school in Gaza City A member of the UN's relief agency for Palestinian refugees (Unrwa) has told the BBC that civilians in Gaza are ""terrified"". ""For me, this has for a couple of days now felt like a full-scale war,"" says Matthias Schmale, who is in charge of the Unrwa's operations in the territory. Some 48,000 people are seeking shelter in 58 of the agency's schools, he says. ""I heard that at least 8,000 people no longer have a home they can go to because itâs either totally destroyed or severely damaged, and then of course we have people killed. ""We have a terrified population worried where the next strike, where the next bomb is going to fall from."" This video can not be played Mark Regev, a senior advisor to Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu, has told the BBC that Israel is looking for ""sustainable peace"" rather than a short-term fix. Regev said such a fix would just become a ""prescription for another Gaza war a month from now"". ""We want to come out of this with a solution that will bring a sustainable period of peace and quiet,"" he said. ""Not some quick fix that will fall apart very quickly."" Â© 2025 BBC.

"The International Energy Agency (IEA) says that no new fossil fuel boilers should be sold from 2025 if the world is to achieve net-zero emissions by the middle of this century. It's one of 400 steps on the road to net-zero proposed by the agency in aspecial report,external. The sale of new petrol and diesel cars around the world would end by 2035. The IEA says that from now, there is no place for new coal, oil or gas exploration or supplies. What can I use instead of a gas boiler and what will it cost? Banish coal, urges UK head of UN climate summit Cutting methane gas 'crucial for climate fight' Do you have a question about green boilers? Emailyourquestions@bbc.co.uk,external The report has been welcomed as an important contribution on the road toCOP26 in Glasgow, when countries will attempt to agree the measures needed to put the Paris climate agreement into practice. In that context, tackling the issue of how the world produces and consumes energy is the most critical endeavour. The energy sector, according to the IEA, is the source of around 75% of the emissions of greenhouse gases that are driving up global temperatures. Models designed so they could switch to burn hydrogen could be an option - and will probably be around Â£100 more than the Â£2,000 standard gas boiler. This will help the climate because hydrogen from renewables burns with no emissions. But climate advisors say it will probably only heat around 11% of homes, because hydrogen supply will be limited. So most are expected to be warmed by heat pumps, which extract warmth from the air or the ground, or from water - a bit like a fridge operating in reverse which sell for between Â£6,000 and Â£18,000. They're subsidised, but MPs say the government needs to offer more help to home owners. What's more, heat pumps need high levels of insulation which aren't always possible. There are other technologies being considered. Geothermal heat may warm places such as Cornwall. Nuclear might figure, too. But the great task of shifting heating from gas will be expensive and difficult. How will we heat homes in zero carbon Britain? To keep the world safe, scientists say that global heating has to be limited to 1.5C by the end of this century. To keep close to that mark, emissions of warming gases need to drop by half by 2030, and essentially hit zero in 2050. The IEA's new study sets out what it believes to be a realistic road map to achieve that aim, while at the same time creating millions of jobs and boosting economic growth. Electric vehicle charge points will have to increase to around 40 million worldwide over the next decade By 2050 it envisions a global economy that is twice as big as today, with two billion extra people but with the demand for energy dropping by 8%. The authors say their plan achieves this with no carbon offsets and a low reliance on technologies to remove carbon from the air. Crucially, it sees no place for new supplies of coal, oil or gas. Fossil fuel use falls drastically in the netâzero emissions scenario by 2050, and no new oil and natural gas fields are required beyond those that have already been approved for development. No new coal mines or mine extensions are required. Emissions from electricity generation fall to netâzero in advanced economies by 2035 and globally by 2040. Renewables drive the transformation, up from 29% of generation in 2020 to nearly 90% in 2050. The number of public charging points for electric cars rises from around one million today to 40 million by 2030, requiring an annual investment of $90bn by the end of the decade. By 2035, nearly all cars sold globally are electric, and by 2050 nearly all heavy trucks sold are fuel cell or electric. Per capita income from oil and gas in countries that rely on fossil fuel production falls by around 75% from $1,800 to $450 by the 2030s. However, the IEA's route to net-zero will require massive investments and international co-operation on an unprecedented scale. It will also have direct impacts on consumers all over the world. Home heating with gas or oil is currently a major source of carbon emissions in many countries, responsible for around 20% of CO2 in the US and the UK. The IEA path to net-zero says that in just four years' time, there should be no new fossil fuel boilers sold, except where they are compatible with hydrogen. This will not be an easy shift for the building sector. ""It will be very difficult, because it means a massive turn in the consumption behaviour,"" said Maria Pastukhova, from the E3G environmental think tank. ""The building sector is maybe one of the toughest ones because aside from the emphasis that the IEA has put on efficient buildings, all the old existing infrastructure has to be retrofitted. And that's a particular challenge for governments."" The IEA says that as well as greening the energy system it will need to be expanded to provide electricity to the 785 million people in the world who have no access at present. A worker cleaning solar panels at a solar park - the IEA says a massive expansion is needed To meet this challenge the world will need to install four times the amount of wind and solar energy than it did in 2020. This equates to adding a massive solar park every day over the next nine years. By 2035 the report says there would be no more sales of new cars with petrol or diesel engines. All of the world's electricity would be emissions free by 2040. While the scale of the change is unprecedented, the IEA believes it will create around 14 million jobs by 2030, while investments in energy production soar to $5tn, boosting global GDP. ""The scale and speed of the efforts demanded by this critical and formidable goal - our best chance of tackling climate change and limiting global warming to 1.5C - make this perhaps the greatest challenge humankind has ever faced,"" said Fatih Birol, the IEA Executive Director. ""The IEA's pathway to this brighter future brings a historic surge in clean energy investment that creates millions of new jobs and lifts global economic growth. Moving the world on to that pathway requires strong and credible policy actions from governments, underpinned by much greater international co-operation."" One issue that has caused concern among environmentalists is the reliance in the report on unproven technologies, such as carbon capture, utilisation and storage (CCUS). There are also worries about bioenergy which involves the use of trees, crops and plants to make liquid fuel or to generate electricity. The IEA path to net-zero sees a significant increase of around 60% in this energy source, with an estimate that energy crops and forestry plantations will take up 25% more land than is used today for bioenergy production. Palm oil has been a major source of bioenergy, used to make diesel ""Burning forests for energy is the latest in a parade of false climate solutions,"" said Hannah Mowat from Fern, a Brussels-based NGO campaigning to protect forests and people. ""Sadly, the IEA has bought into it by proposing wholly unrealistic levels of bioenergy, which will damage forests the world over and worsen climate change. Instead of burning trees for energy, we should focus on cutting fossil fuel use, maximising energy efficiency and increasing renewables such as solar, wind, heat pumps and geothermal.""

"Israel's military is preparing for an ""intensive"" night of strikes in Gaza, Israeli media report Air strikes and rocket fire claimed more lives on Tuesday In one incident, rockets fired from Gaza into Israel killed two workers from Thailand Following attacks from militants Israel closes a crossing into Gaza which opened briefly to allow in aid Palestinians and Israeli Arabs have been holding a general strike President Biden has joined calls for a ceasefire between Israel and Palestinian militants The violence has entered its second week and killed more than 200 people in Gaza and 12 in Israel Edited by Rebecca Seales We're now pausing our live coverage of the ongoing Israel-Gaza conflict - many thanks for staying with us. To recap, here are the key developments from the past 24 hours: Family and friends attend the funeral of Yigal Yehoshua, a Jewish man killed in clashes with Israeli Arabs The funeral has taken place of a Jewish man who died after sustaining serious injuries during violence between Israeli Arabs and Jews in Israel's central city of Lod last week. Mourners attended the service for Yigal Yehoshua, 56, who was hit in the head by a large rock or brick thrown by protesters while driving home in Lod, a city not far from Tel Aviv, on 11 May. Yehoshua was taken to hospital for treatment, but later died of his injuries. A mourner drapes himself with an Israeli flag At least 12 people were reportedly injured in the clashes that day, which followed the funeral of an Israeli Arab man who died during unrest in the city a day earlier. The BBC's Rushdi Abualouf in Gaza shared this video showing collapsed buildings on a major street there. Trees line one side of the road, while the other is scarred by rubble and twisted metal.

The Palestinian health ministry said 72 Palestinians are receiving treatment for injuries Two more Palestinians have died after they were hit by live fire during clashes with Israeli security forces in the West Bank, the Palestinian health ministry has said. The ministry said three Palestinians have now died and 72 were injured - five critically - after today's unrest in the area. The violence came as Palestinians across the West Bank and in east Jerusalem observed a general strike in support of those under bombardment in the Gaza Strip. Israeli's military is yet to comment on the three deaths. But in an earlier statement, the Israeli army said its soldiers ""responded with fire"" after ""a number of rioters fired extensively"" at them near Ramallah. ""Two soldiers were injured in their legs, and were evacuated to a hospital for further medical treatment,"" the military said. BBC OS The BBC OS radio show on the World Service has
been speaking to people across Israel and Gaza to hear their stories and
experiences. Today they spoke to a Jewish
Israeli mother in the city of Lod, which has seen unrest and violence. Katy Berman, a mother of seven and teacher: ""I personally did not leave the house for 4 days, I was so
scared, scared I would get a rock thrown through my car window, scared someone
would ambush me... ""When I met my (Arab) neighbour we spoke about how we felt
the night before when we were woke up umpteen times by the sirens. Because
rockets are coming, and on top of the rioting weâre having rockets sent over by
Hamas in Gaza. So we spoke as two mothers you know, âhow did you sleep at
night?â and âhow did your kids sleep at night', and how scary is it. ""My older kids are very worried about the situation,
theyâre worried in the way they wish they were here and could help and do
something. With my younger kids, they donât really know whatâs going onâ¦.. Iâm
not sure what to tell them, Iâm not sure what theyâll understand, how theyâll
go in the street â I donât want them to be scared."" Israeli reports say the military has issued new safety rules for the West Bank Israel's military has enacted emergency security rules in parts of the West Bank, reports say. The Times of Israel newspaper said,externalthe military had declared a âspecial situationâ in several areas, citing the threat of rocket fire. It said the declaration was not related to unrest in the West Bank, which has seen violent confrontations between Palestinians and Israeli police today. Under the rules, schools, universities and workplaces will only be allowed to remain open if they are in the vicinity of a protective area,according to another Israeli newspaper, the Jerusalem Post,external. The paper said Elkana, Karnei Shomron, and Oranit were among the areas where these rules would apply. It did not specify when they would come into force or how long they would apply for. The EU's foreign affairs chief, Josep Borrell, called for an ""immediate cessation of all violence"" Hungary has refused to back a European Union statement that called for a ceasefire between Israel and the Palestinians. Hungary's foreign minister Peter Szijjarto dismissed the EU's statement on Israel as ""one-sided"". ""I have a general problem with these European statements on Israel,"" Szijjarto told the AFP news agency. He said ""these statements do not help, especially not under current circumstances, when the tension is so high."" His comments came after the EU's foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, called for an ""immediate cessation of all violence and the implementation of a ceasefire"". Borrell said the statement was backed by all EU member states except Hungary. In recent years Hungary has been one of Israel's staunchest supporters in Europe. It has blocked several EU efforts to criticise Israeli policies, such as the US move to recognise Jerusalem as Israel's capital. Palestinian militants can move fast inside their underground tunnel network (file photo) Israel's military is preparing to strikemore targets linked to the Palestinian group Hamas's network of underground tunnels,externalin Gaza, the Jerusalem Post reports. The newspaper quotes Israel Defense Forces (IDF) spokesman Brig Gen Hidai Zilberman as describing ""an intensive night ahead of us"" as its operations look to strike ""new locations"". The IDF said it had struck dozens of ""terror targets"" and had already destroyed more than 15km (9.3 miles) of an underground tunnel network belonging to Hamas. Tunnel systems used by Hamas fighters have long been an important target for Israeli air raids. Earlier today, Brig Gen Zilberman told Israel's Army Radio that the IDF was ""not talking about a
ceasefire"", adding: ""We're focused on the firing."" A large blaze has broken out at a paint warehouse in the town of Rafah in Gaza following a reported Israeli strike. Eyewitnesses said a shell had hit the property on Tuesday afternoon, Reuters reports. It is not clear why the warehouse would have been targeted. Images show firefighters tackling the blaze while workers attempt to rescue stored items. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu spoke at an air base Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has reaffirmed his government's commitment to its operations against Palestinian militants in Gaza. Speaking at an air base a short time ago, Netanyahu said Israel would continue striking targets there ""for as long as necessary to restore quiet to the citizens of Israel"". He said Hamas, the militant group that rules Gaza, had ""received blows it did not expect"", setting it back by ""years"". ""Our enemies around us can see what price we exact for attacks against us,"" Netanyahu said. The Times of Israel newspaper said,externalrocket alarms sounded at the base near Beersheba during Netanyahuâs visit. Mustafa Barghouti, the West Bank-based leader of the
Palestinian National Initiative political party, tells BBC World News: âPalestinians
are ready for a ceasefire; itâs Israel that is abstaining from a ceasefire.â Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu wants to end rocket
attacks by Hamas and other Palestinian militant groups in Gaza and says its air
strikes will continue for âas long as it takes in order to
restore calm for all of Israelâs citizensâ. âIf Israel wants to keep shooting and throwing rockets
with their F-16 jet fightersâ¦ and wants Palestinians not to defend themselves, of
course that will not happen,â Mr Barghouti says. âA ceasefire means that nobody
will send rockets - that nobody will shoot on both sides.â This video can not be played Dr Barghouti: Ceasefire needs both sides not to shoot Germany has pledged â¬40m ($48.9m; Â£34.4m) in humanitarian aid for civilians in Gaza. According to the UN more than 52,000 Palestinians have been displaced by the current violence. German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas said he would ""lobby for a better humanitarian supply in Gaza"" at a meeting of EU member states today. He also condemned rocket attacks on Israel from Hamas, and stressed that Israel had the right to defend itself. A Palestinian protester has been killed in clashes with
Israeli security forces on the outskirts of the city of Ramallah, in
the occupied West Bank, according to the Palestinian health ministry. The ministry said the 25-year-old man was shot in the
chest at the entrance to al-Bireh. Another 50 people were
injured, five of them seriously, it added. The Palestinian news agency Wafa reported,externalthat Israeli
forces fired live rounds, rubber-coated bullets and tear gas during a protest against Israelâs air strikes on the Gaza Strip and its actions against
Palestinians elsewhere. Palestinian factions had called for a ""day of rage"". The Israeli military said ""a number of rioters fired extensively"" at its soldiers near Ramallah, and that they ""responded with fire"".
   ""Two soldiers were injured in their legs, and were evacuated to a hospital for further medical treatment,"" it added. There were also clashes between protesters and Israeli forces
in Bethlehem, where the health ministry said nine people were injured, and in occupied East Jerusalem. A Norwegian aid group has been powerfully drawing attention to the deaths of children in the conflict, noting that a number of young people killed in Gaza were directly receiving its help.

""We are devastated to learn that... children we were helping with trauma were bombarded while they were at home and thought they were safe,"" the head of the Norwegian Refugee Council, Jan Egeland, added. At least two Israeli children have been killed by rockets fired from Gaza by Hamas militants since the start of this latest conflict - and Israel says many more are living in fear. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken has denied the US is obstructing diplomacy, after the country refused to back a UN Security Council declaration on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. China has accused the US of hindering the Council's efforts to speak with ""one voice"". But Blinken insists the US is ""engaged in quiet, but very intensive diplomacy"". He said: ""... Would any given action or any given statement actually advance the goal of ending the violence?"" ""If we think, going forward, that there's something, including at the United Nations, that would actually effectively advance the objective, we would be for it,"" he said. The UN Security Council is due to meet for a fourth emergency session later on Tuesday. German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Jordanâs King
Abdullah II have called for a âspeedyâ ceasefire to end the hostilities between
Israel and Palestinian militants in Gaza. Mrs Merkelâs spokesman said
that both leaders had âagreed that initiatives for a speedy ceasefire should be
supported in order to create the conditions for the resumption of political
negotiationsâ. French Prime Minister Jean Castex also called for an
immediate end to the violence and urged
Israel to guarantee unhindered access for aid to Gaza. Egypt has sent 65 tonnes of medical aid to neighbouring Gaza, as the fighting in the region shows no sign of easing. It comes after the UN said at least six hospitals in the territory had been damaged since the conflict erupted more than a week ago. Healthcare and other services have also been disrupted by frequent power cuts. The only coronavirus-testing laboratory in Gaza - which has one of the highest rates of positive tests in the world - was knocked out on Monday. The supplies sent by Egypt include specialist burns treatment materials as well as ""ventilators, oxygen tanks [and] syringes,"" Health Minister Hala Zayed said. Rockets fired from Gaza fly towards Israel (file photo) We earlier posted on reports that Palestinian rockets launched into southern Israel had struck a packaging factory in the Eshkol region and killed two Thai workers. Thailand's foreign ministry has now confirmed that two of its citizens died - while eight others were wounded - in the attack at 14:50 local time (11:50 GMT) some 14km (about nine miles) from the border with Gaza. The two Thai men had been working at the Obad farming estate in Eshkol town, the ministry said. One eyewitness, Adirek Jinseng, a Thai worker at the estate, told the BBC's Thai service that the attack happened as people were resting during their lunch break. ""I heard two explosions in the sky, but there was no warning siren. More than 10 workers then rushed... to hide in the bunkers,"" Adirek said, adding that he saw one person killed at the scene and several others with serious injuries. A senior Thai diplomat in Israel told the BBC that around 4,000 of the country's citizens had been working within a 100km radius of Gaza. Some were relocated to safer areas over the weekend. These Palestinian children fled their homes and sought refuge at a UN-run school in Gaza City A member of the UN's relief agency for Palestinian refugees (Unrwa) has told the BBC that civilians in Gaza are ""terrified"". ""For me, this has for a couple of days now felt like a full-scale war,"" says Matthias Schmale, who is in charge of the Unrwa's operations in the territory. Some 48,000 people are seeking shelter in 58 of the agency's schools, he says. ""I heard that at least 8,000 people no longer have a home they can go to because itâs either totally destroyed or severely damaged, and then of course we have people killed. ""We have a terrified population worried where the next strike, where the next bomb is going to fall from."" This video can not be played Mark Regev, a senior advisor to Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu, has told the BBC that Israel is looking for ""sustainable peace"" rather than a short-term fix. Regev said such a fix would just become a ""prescription for another Gaza war a month from now"". ""We want to come out of this with a solution that will bring a sustainable period of peace and quiet,"" he said. ""Not some quick fix that will fall apart very quickly."" Â© 2025 BBC.

We're going to bring our coverage of the pandemic to an end shortly. Before we go here's a summary of the main stories from the UK and around the world. This video can not be played Residents of two tower blocks in a west German town have been quarantined after a woman in the building tested positive for the Indian variant of Covid-19. ""We just saw a mass of public order officers suddenly turn up and we were locked in,"" said a woman from the town of Velbert. You can watch the events unfold in the clip below. A council with one of the lowest vaccination rates in England has issued a ""strong plea"" to the government to extend the vaccination rollout to all adults. About 70% of the over-40s in Luton have had a first dose of vaccine, the second lowest percentage outside London. Luton's director of public health Lucy Hubber said the current rollout was ""not accessible to many in our population"". She added factors such as ""social deprivation, a high-proportion of frontline workers not able to work from home, demographic make-up and large numbers of multi-generational households"" made Luton more vulnerable to Covid-19. But the council said the government had not allowed it ""greater flexibility in the ways that the vaccine is offered"". The NHS website for booking vaccinations is now open to those aged 36 and over, and the government said local areas should not vaccinate young people earlier than planned. Read more. Hugh PymBBC News Health Editor There are growing worries about cases of the
Indian variant in London. Infections are still thinly spread and most are
linked to foreign travel. But officials are braced for community
transmission to develop in some areas of the capital. Professor Kevin Fenton, Regional Director for London at
Public Health England, told the BBC: ""We are very concernedâ¦ because numbers of cases of the
variant first described in India are increasing across the city. ""We are seeing
particular increases in different geographic areas such as the North West but
many of our boroughs are seeing cases as the variant spreads."" The government can keep the amount of public money spent on unusable personal protective equipment from two companies confidential, the High Court has ruled. The Good Law Project and EveryDoctor are bringing legal action against the Department of Health and Social Care, claiming that contracts awarded to PestFix, Clandeboye and Ayanda Capital were given unlawfully at the height of the first wave of the coronavirus pandemic in April and May 2020. The two groups allege DHSC has failed to provide proper reasons for why the contracts were awarded and say the government violated principles of equal treatment and transparency when making the deals, worth more than Â£700m. Jason Coppel QC, for the groups, said approximately Â£595m was spent with PestFix and Ayanda, but it is not publicly known how much of this was spent on PPE which did not meet technical standards. The breakdown of the spending on each type of PPE or the amount paid in pre-payments by the government to the companies has been kept confidential. The DHSC argued they are commercially sensitive and Mrs Justice O'Farrell found the specific pricing details were not relevant to what the court has to decide and did not need to be disclosed to the public. A large part of the Good Law Project and
EveryDoctor's claim is that the use of a ""VIP lane"" gave an unfair,
unlawful advantage to some companies. DHSC
is contesting the claim and has told the court that it ""wholeheartedly
rejects"" the case against it. Michael Bowsher QC, for the DHSC, said
in written submissions that at the time of lockdown and rising infection and death, it was their duty to secure unprecedented volumes of PPE and medical devices to save lives. He said the government put together an unprecedented programme during a serious crisis when the pandemic had reshaped the PPE market. In a statement, the department said the
National Audit Office found no evidence ministers were involved in procurement
decisions. The case, which is being heard remotely by Mrs Justice O'Farrell, is expected to end on Tuesday next week. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has warned people should not be holidaying in amber list countries, after a minister said people could go and visit friends. The confusion arose after Environment Secretary George Eustice said people could go to those countries if they quarantined when they returned. It comes after news thatsome holiday companies are refusing refundsto such destinations. That is because it is now legal to travel to countries on the amber list. Read more here. Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent Day by day the scientists are learning more about the Indian variant - and the implications for the UK. On Friday it was reported the variant could be 50% more transmissible than the UK variant, which was responsible for the deadly winter wave. But confidence in that figure was always a little shaky. In the past few days there are some tentative signs its transmissibility may not be so high. That's important. There's estimated to be an eight-fold difference between the impact in terms of hospital admissions a variant with a 20% advantage will have compared to one with a 50% advantage. That clearly has a major implication for what restrictions are needed while the vaccination programme continues to be rolled out. The next significant update is expected on Thursday. It will be too soon for a definitive answer, but it should help us understand more about what the variant means for the UK. This video can not be played Birmingham's 85-year-old pedlar selling wares pub to pub When Covid-19 shut the pubs, it also shut down business for 85-year-old Ralph Russell - possibly Birmingham's last pedlar. But now he is back selling his wares from a suitcase in his old stomping ground of Digbeth, just as he has done since he was 15. It's believed he holds the last pedlar's certificate granted in Birmingham under the Pedlars Act of 1871, which means he can sell goods door-to-door, travelling on foot and carrying his wares. Ralph claims to have visited every pub in Birmingham in his career - which in his prime would have involved walking 20 miles a day to sell items like socks, toys and tea towels. Pub-goers say he's a well-known and much-loved character. More than one million people in Northern Ireland have received a first dose of a Covid-19 vaccine, according to the latest government figures. That is about 69% of the adult population. Patricia Donnelly, who leads NI's Covid vaccination programme, said she was ""determined to maintain momentum"". It is almost six months since thefirst vaccine was administered to Sister Joanna Sloanat the Royal Victoria Hospital last December. The 28-year-old County Down woman was applauded by colleagues after being given the Pfizer-BioNTech jab. Read more here. BBC Radio 5 Live Bolton resident Sushma  has had both her vaccines.

Ferdinand OmondiBBC News, Nairobi Kenya will exhaust its supply of Covid-19 vaccines as early as next week, the chairman of the country's vaccination taskforce has told the BBC. Dr Willis Akhwale said Kenya had received more than one million doses out of 3.5 million AstraZeneca vaccines that it requested from Covax. ""We have vaccinated close to 940,000 Kenyans, so we don't have more doses remaining,"" he said. This means less than 2% of Kenyans have received their first jab. Health authorities had expected to begin administering the second dose from the first week of June but this timeline can no longer be guaranteed. India's suspension of vaccine export as it deals with an exponential surge of cases has affected vaccine campaigns around the world, especially in countries depending on the AstraZeneca vaccine. Dr Akhwale said Kenya had ordered 30 million doses from Johnson & Johnson which are expected to be delivered in August. Experts are warning that insufficient vaccination in African countries may lead to mutations of coronavirus, creating a crisis similar to India's. Dr Akhwale said that equitable distribution of vaccines ""must happen"". ""'You are not safe until I am safe' must be our guiding principle,"" he added. Darren Millar said he was ""very sorry"" after being seen drinking in the Senedd tea room during a Covid pub ban A Tory member of the Welsh Senedd hasreturned to the role of chief whip, after earlier resigning the job when he was seen drinking on the parliamentary estate during a Covid pub ban. Darren Millar has been named as chief whip again following the Senedd elections on 6 May. Three other Senedd members were seen drinking during the incident in the Welsh Parliament's tea room last December - then Tory group leader Paul Davies, Labour's Alun Davies and former Conservative member Nick Ramsay. Two investigations into the incident are still going on: one by the Senedd's standards commissioner and one by the local licensing board. At the time of his resignation, Millar said he had been advised that he had not breached coronavirus regulations, although he was ""very sorry"". BBC Radio 5 Live We've been hearing about the sharp rise in cases of the Indian variant of coronavirus cases in Bolton, Blackburn and Bedford in the past few days. Dr Sarah Chan is a Reader in Bioethics at the Usher Institute at the University of Edinburgh and part of the UK Pandemic Ethics Accelerator Programme. Speaking on the sharp rise in areas such as Bolton, Dr Chan told 5 Liveâs Nicky Campbell that we need to understand the reasons people havenât take up the vaccine instead of passing moral judgement on them. ""If youâre finger-pointing and labelling, calling people selfish or irresponsible, we know that kind of language, that kind of tactic is divisive, itâs polarising,"" she said. ""Creating stigma and encouraging us to blame each other is not going to be effective in increasing vaccine uptake...itâs going to damage cooperation, solidarity, cohesion.""

About 150 flights a day are heading to countries the government advises against travelling to Earlier, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said that people should only travel to countries on the amber list in the government's traffic-light system if they have a ""pressing reason"" and not for a holiday. Underthe traffic light system, people can travel to countries on the green list without quarantine, must self-isolate for 10 days after visiting amber list countries, and must stay in government-mandated hotel quarantine if they visit a red list country. Although from yesterday it is no longer illegal, the government still advises people not to travel to countries on the amber list. Reporters had questioned the PM on why there were 150 flights a day heading to amber list countries and whether Environment Secretary George Eustice was wrong to suggest this morning that people could travel to visit friends and family ""if they feel the need"". Labour's shadow home secretary says ministers are ""giving out conflicting and confused adviceâ and repeats the party's call to pause international travel. He says the government's travel policies have âunravelled into dangerous chaos within a matter of hoursâ. Chris JeavansBBC News The variant first discovered in India can be found across England, but there are only a small number of hotspots. The most up-to-date data, covering the week up to Saturday 8 May, shows that most of the local authorities in England that have found a case havenât found many. Theyâre shown by the light blue areas in this map. There are a small number of places that have seen high numbers of the variant: Bolton, Blackburn with Darwen, Sefton and Bedford. Theyâre among the areas with the highest numbers of cases in the UK, fuelling concerns that this version of coronavirus may spread more quickly than the Kent strain that has been dominant since December. But scientists advising the government say itâs too soon to know one way or the other and that theyâll be working hard over the coming weeks to answer that question. Travelling is dangerous and ""not for this year"", a health minister has said as he urged people to stay in the UK. The ban on foreign holidays was lifted in the latest easing of lockdown restrictions on Monday. People can now go on an overseas break to a limited number of green list destinations without having to quarantine on their return. But Lord Bethell indicated that people should not be going abroad at all this year, stressing that ""travel is dangerous"" due to difficulties over segregation during the journey, including at airports. He made his remarks amid continuing concern over the rise in cases of the highly transmissible Indian coronavirus variant in parts of England. Speaking at Westminster, Lord Bethell told peers: ""Travelling is dangerous. That is not news to us or to the people who get on those planes in the first place. ""We do ask people, particularly as we go into the summer, travelling is not for this year, please stay in this country."" Read more on the rules for foreign travel here. Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst Taiwanâs Central Epidemic Command Center has confirmed a further two people have died from Covid-19, taking the country's total death toll to 14. According to Taiwanâs Central News Agency, one of the deceased was an 86-year-old man ""with multiple chronic diseases"". The other was a woman in her 60s. Both had only tested positive two days earlier. The patients lived in New Taipei and Taipei City, the two areas of Taiwan that are currently experiencing level three Covid-19 restrictions. Taiwan has four Covid-19 response levels, and a level three alert is a ânear lockdownâ, where mask-wearing is enforced and all but essential businesses are closed. The island is currently experiencing its worst outbreak since the beginning of the pandemic. There have been more than 1,000 locally transmitted cases recorded over the last week. Yesterday, Taiwan recorded 333 cases - a record daily high since the pandemic began. The island also announced it was barring entry to non-Taiwanese nationals, and all schools across the island have now closed until 28 May. Last year, Taiwan was deemed something of a success story. At the end of 2020, it had only recorded 799 cases of Covid-19. There have now been more than 2,260 cases in total, and 1,119 of those are active cases. BBC Radio 5 Live Earlier today, 5 Live's Your Call programmed asked listeners whether they agreed with theatre impresario Andrew Lloyd Webber's comments that people who refused the vaccine were selfish. The composercompared vaccine refusers to drunk drivers. Mark, from the South West, said it was an unfair comparison. ""Iâm absolutely in fear of the vaccine...Iâm more in fear of the vaccine than I am of coronavirus,"" he said. ""I donât smoke, I take great care of myself. I make sure that everything I want to take on board into my body...I make sure that itâs good for me. Iâm not perfect but you cannot label me as the same."" Rachel, in Malvern, said she agreed with Lord Lloyd-Webber. ""Youâve only got to have a look at India and whatâs going on in those countries, the amount of people getting really ill, I find it disgraceful that people think they shouldn't have the vaccine,"" she said. ""I accept there are people with health issues that canât, but anybody else who refuses to have it, I honestly feel they should lose their jobs, they shouldnât be allowed to work with the public in any capacity, they should have to stay at home...no benefits should be paid, no wages, no furlough.""

"Offering children in some richer countries a coronavirus vaccine before some high-risk people in poorer ones is ""morally wrong"", a group of MPs has been told. Prof Andrew Pollard, who helped develop the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine, said the ""inequity"" of vaccine distribution must change ""urgently"". The US and Canada have made a jab available to children as young as 12. But in many low-income countries those most at risk are yet to be vaccinated. ""The overall aim of a global vaccination programme in a pandemic is to stop people dying,"" said Prof Pollard, director of the Oxford Vaccine Group, who led the trials for the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine. ""I have worked in Nepal and Bangladesh and colleagues there are facing the most appalling circumstances - they're not working in a situation where there's an NHS to support them,"" he told the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Coronavirus. ""It feels completely wrong to be in a situation morally where we are allowing that to happen whilst in many countries vaccines are being rolled out to younger and younger populations at very, very low risk. ""Children have near to zero risk of severe disease or death."" The Pfizer vaccine, which has been approved in the US and Canada, has completed trials in adolescents. And a number of other Covid vaccines are being tested on this age group and younger. But Prof Pollard said: ""The main issue at the moment is to try and make sure the doses go to those in greatest need. ""This is a global problem which impacts our economies and puts pressure on health systems."" Studies show over-50s, people with certain health conditions and healthcare workers are most likely to become seriously ill or die from coronavirus - but many in parts of Africa and South Asia are still waiting for a vaccine. Campaigners warn supply shortages are a huge concern. Covax, the international scheme to ensure equal access to Covid vaccines, is currently short of 140 million doses, after a disruption in supply from India. Unicef and the World Health Organization have both called on wealthier countries to share their surplus supplies, as some have ordered enough to vaccinate their populations many times over. A Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office spokesperson said Â£548 million has been provided to deliver more than a billion vaccines to more than 70 countries. They added the UK will share the ""majority of any future surplus coronavirus vaccines from our supply with the COVAX pool, when these are available"". India's Covid crisis hits vaccine-sharing scheme Prof Pollard said his key message to the government would be to act with ""absolute urgency"" or ""many millions could die between now and September"". ""We can't wait until later this year to make decisions, he said. ""It has to be now that we look at redistribution and how we get doses to countries that have poor access at the moment - and that is through Covax."" UK pledges surplus Covid vaccines to poorer nations Another witness told the MPs' panel richer countries were ""hoarding doses"" and he feared they would do the same with potential booster shots in the future. But the production of vaccine in low- and middle-income countries would prevent this. ""We hear from so many manufacturers in places like Pakistan and Bangladesh and Indonesia - they're ready, they've got some capacity,"" Prof Gavin Yamey, director of the Centre for Policy Impact in Global Health, at Duke University, in the US, said. ""It's fine to continue donating - but there has to be a long-term vision. ""This pandemic could be with us for years. ""Is it really just going to be charity - drip, drip, drip of a few doses from rich countries? ""That's not a long-term vision."" LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area?

"The International Energy Agency (IEA) says that no new fossil fuel boilers should be sold from 2025 if the world is to achieve net-zero emissions by the middle of this century. It's one of 400 steps on the road to net-zero proposed by the agency in aspecial report,external. The sale of new petrol and diesel cars around the world would end by 2035. The IEA says that from now, there is no place for new coal, oil or gas exploration or supplies. What can I use instead of a gas boiler and what will it cost? Banish coal, urges UK head of UN climate summit Cutting methane gas 'crucial for climate fight' Do you have a question about green boilers? Emailyourquestions@bbc.co.uk,external The report has been welcomed as an important contribution on the road toCOP26 in Glasgow, when countries will attempt to agree the measures needed to put the Paris climate agreement into practice. In that context, tackling the issue of how the world produces and consumes energy is the most critical endeavour. The energy sector, according to the IEA, is the source of around 75% of the emissions of greenhouse gases that are driving up global temperatures. Models designed so they could switch to burn hydrogen could be an option - and will probably be around Â£100 more than the Â£2,000 standard gas boiler. This will help the climate because hydrogen from renewables burns with no emissions. But climate advisors say it will probably only heat around 11% of homes, because hydrogen supply will be limited. So most are expected to be warmed by heat pumps, which extract warmth from the air or the ground, or from water - a bit like a fridge operating in reverse which sell for between Â£6,000 and Â£18,000. They're subsidised, but MPs say the government needs to offer more help to home owners. What's more, heat pumps need high levels of insulation which aren't always possible. There are other technologies being considered. Geothermal heat may warm places such as Cornwall. Nuclear might figure, too. But the great task of shifting heating from gas will be expensive and difficult. How will we heat homes in zero carbon Britain? To keep the world safe, scientists say that global heating has to be limited to 1.5C by the end of this century. To keep close to that mark, emissions of warming gases need to drop by half by 2030, and essentially hit zero in 2050. The IEA's new study sets out what it believes to be a realistic road map to achieve that aim, while at the same time creating millions of jobs and boosting economic growth. Electric vehicle charge points will have to increase to around 40 million worldwide over the next decade By 2050 it envisions a global economy that is twice as big as today, with two billion extra people but with the demand for energy dropping by 8%. The authors say their plan achieves this with no carbon offsets and a low reliance on technologies to remove carbon from the air. Crucially, it sees no place for new supplies of coal, oil or gas. Fossil fuel use falls drastically in the netâzero emissions scenario by 2050, and no new oil and natural gas fields are required beyond those that have already been approved for development. No new coal mines or mine extensions are required. Emissions from electricity generation fall to netâzero in advanced economies by 2035 and globally by 2040. Renewables drive the transformation, up from 29% of generation in 2020 to nearly 90% in 2050. The number of public charging points for electric cars rises from around one million today to 40 million by 2030, requiring an annual investment of $90bn by the end of the decade. By 2035, nearly all cars sold globally are electric, and by 2050 nearly all heavy trucks sold are fuel cell or electric. Per capita income from oil and gas in countries that rely on fossil fuel production falls by around 75% from $1,800 to $450 by the 2030s. However, the IEA's route to net-zero will require massive investments and international co-operation on an unprecedented scale. It will also have direct impacts on consumers all over the world. Home heating with gas or oil is currently a major source of carbon emissions in many countries, responsible for around 20% of CO2 in the US and the UK. The IEA path to net-zero says that in just four years' time, there should be no new fossil fuel boilers sold, except where they are compatible with hydrogen. This will not be an easy shift for the building sector. ""It will be very difficult, because it means a massive turn in the consumption behaviour,"" said Maria Pastukhova, from the E3G environmental think tank. ""The building sector is maybe one of the toughest ones because aside from the emphasis that the IEA has put on efficient buildings, all the old existing infrastructure has to be retrofitted. And that's a particular challenge for governments."" The IEA says that as well as greening the energy system it will need to be expanded to provide electricity to the 785 million people in the world who have no access at present. A worker cleaning solar panels at a solar park - the IEA says a massive expansion is needed To meet this challenge the world will need to install four times the amount of wind and solar energy than it did in 2020. This equates to adding a massive solar park every day over the next nine years. By 2035 the report says there would be no more sales of new cars with petrol or diesel engines. All of the world's electricity would be emissions free by 2040. While the scale of the change is unprecedented, the IEA believes it will create around 14 million jobs by 2030, while investments in energy production soar to $5tn, boosting global GDP. ""The scale and speed of the efforts demanded by this critical and formidable goal - our best chance of tackling climate change and limiting global warming to 1.5C - make this perhaps the greatest challenge humankind has ever faced,"" said Fatih Birol, the IEA Executive Director. ""The IEA's pathway to this brighter future brings a historic surge in clean energy investment that creates millions of new jobs and lifts global economic growth. Moving the world on to that pathway requires strong and credible policy actions from governments, underpinned by much greater international co-operation."" One issue that has caused concern among environmentalists is the reliance in the report on unproven technologies, such as carbon capture, utilisation and storage (CCUS). There are also worries about bioenergy which involves the use of trees, crops and plants to make liquid fuel or to generate electricity. The IEA path to net-zero sees a significant increase of around 60% in this energy source, with an estimate that energy crops and forestry plantations will take up 25% more land than is used today for bioenergy production. Palm oil has been a major source of bioenergy, used to make diesel ""Burning forests for energy is the latest in a parade of false climate solutions,"" said Hannah Mowat from Fern, a Brussels-based NGO campaigning to protect forests and people. ""Sadly, the IEA has bought into it by proposing wholly unrealistic levels of bioenergy, which will damage forests the world over and worsen climate change. Instead of burning trees for energy, we should focus on cutting fossil fuel use, maximising energy efficiency and increasing renewables such as solar, wind, heat pumps and geothermal.""

"There were more than a million hospital admissions for obesity-related treatment in England in the year leading into the global pandemic, figures reveal. The record number provides the clearest indication yet of the scale of the obesity problem as coronavirus started to spread across the UK. Being overweight is one of the most significant risk factors for severe Covid. Experts say the data should be a wake-up call for tackling obesity. The figures, published by NHS Digital, show a 17% increase in hospital admissions where obesity was a factor, compared with the year before. This amounts to almost 150,000 more instances of people being admitted to hospital over the course of a year. The number of admissions where obesity was recorded as the main cause actually fell to 10,780 last year, from 11,117 in 2018-19. But this is mainly due to a fall in the number of bariatric surgeries (including gastric bands and bypasses) being performed. Women accounted for two-thirds (64%) of admissions where obesity was a factor. Naveed Sattar, professor of metabolic medicine, at the University of Glasgow, says obesity is ""the strongest risk factor for [Type 2] diabetes"". ""It's a strong risk factor for heart disease, for heart failure, for lung disease, for kidney disease, for multiple other conditions,"" he says. ""If we now add to that obesity is a strong risk factor for this acute viral pandemic which is killing people worldwide, then... this is a wake-up call. ""Many health systems and government really do now need to pay attention to obesity. ""We do need to tackle obesity and we need to take it seriously."" 'They told me I could die' At his heaviest, Phil Skeates weighed 25 stone (159kg). And when he developed coronavirus, last year, he ended up needing intensive care. ""It was horrible,"" Mr Skeates says. ""I was blue-lighted. ""As I was taken out of the house, I said goodbye to my wife. ""I was crying my eyes out in the ambulance. ""It was heartbreaking. ""My thoughts were I may not see her again. ""They'd actually told me if I caught Covid, there was every chance that I would die."" ""On the ward, I saw two people pass away. ""It was a massive massive point. ""It really made me think I need to address this."" Phil has now lost more than six stone. ""I paid the price,"" he says. ""I've come through it and I'm not going back."" Scientists are still trying to understand why the coronavirus poses such a risk to those significantly overweight. Prof Sattar says there is some evidence heavier people have a higher viral load or more virus in their bodies than others and the virus triggers a dangerous response by the immune system. ""There may be a critical interaction between fat cells and the immune response which increases the likelihood of that immune response being exaggerated and harmful,"" he says. ""We also know that people who are heavier have thicker blood to begin with, and this hyper-response thickens the blood even more. ""So the likelihood is that this thickness will clot off blood vessels and block blood vessels. ""People who are overweight, effectively have less capacity to deal with the damage Covid causes."" And for many people, the pandemic has led to weight gain, early evidence suggests. NHS England medical director Professor Stephen Powis said: ""Today's shocking figures are a growing sign of the nation's obesity crisis which is putting hundreds of thousands of people at greater risk of becoming severely ill with Covid, as well as heart attacks, stroke, cancer and other deadly diseases"". This is a real concern, Susan Jebb, professor of diet and population, at Oxford University, says. ""People have gained 2-3kg but that is very unevenly spread - some people have gained much more,"" she says. ""And it seems to be a particular problem for women, for younger people and for those living in deprived areas."" Pressure is piling on the government to take radical action to address the obesity problem. Last month, doctors, academics, campaigners and public-sector experts wrote to the prime minister, urging him to stick to a landmark government proposal to ban junk-food advertising online and on social media - after fears it could be ditched. The government says it has a clear plan to introduce a ban on junk-food adverts on television before 21:00. It has now finished a consultation with industry and how far it is prepared to go with restrictions online will be revealed in the next few weeks.

"This video can not be played It's the ""right time to leave Crystal Palace and maybe to leave football for a while"" - Hodgson Manager Roy Hodgson will leave Crystal Palace when his contract expires at the end of the season. The 73-year-old former England boss said: ""The time is right to step away from the rigours of top-flight Premier League football."" Hodgson has been in charge of Palace since September 2017. His final home game will be against Arsenal on Wednesday, and his last match will be against Liverpool, one of his former clubs, at Anfield on Sunday. Live: Latest reaction to Hodgson's announcement Asked whether he was retiring, Hodgson said: ""One never knows. It is a dangerous thing to do when you still feel good about yourself to start making bold statements about retirement. ""I am certainly not leaving Crystal Palace with the idea of putting myself back on the market for another job. ""I really am stepping away from football for a while, but who knows what the future will be? It is a never-say-never moment. ""I've seen so many people retire with all the fanfare blazing, only to surface again somewhere in a fairly short period of time. I'd prefer not to do that. ""I am looking forward to spending a little bit more time with my wife and son and maybe listening to what they want to do for once, because it hasn't happened very much in the last 50 years."" Hodgson, who began his playing career at Palace and supported them as a child, replaced Frank de Boer as manager with the club bottom of the Premier League having lost their first four matches of the 2017-18 season without scoring a goal. Despite losing his first three games in charge, he guided Palace to 11th in the table. They finished 12th and 14th in subsequent seasons and are currently 13th with two games remaining. Palace chairman Steve Parish said: ""It has been an absolute privilege and pleasure to work alongside Roy, who is both a magnificent human and an outstanding football manager. ""I know how much it has meant to Roy managing the club he supported as a child, adding to his distinguished and unparalleled career in football management. ""His record with us simply cannot be overstated - he is the only Palace manager to secure four years in the Premier League and he has helped give us stability in the most turbulent of times. ""We will be forever grateful for his immense contribution."" Hodgson, who is the oldest person to manage in the Premier League, began his managerial career 45 years ago with Swedish side Halmstads. He has managed 16 clubs in eight countries, including Inter Milan and Udinese, as well as the Switzerland, United Arab Emirates and Finland national sides. He has also been in charge of Blackburn, Liverpool, West Brom and Fulham in the Premier League, guiding the Cottagers to the Europa League final in 2010. He took the England job shortly before Euro 2012 and led them to the quarter-finals, but two years later they were knocked out at the group stage of a World Cup for the first time since 1958. Hodgson's England won all 10 matches in qualifying for Euro 2016 but he stepped down after a 2-1 last-16 defeat by Iceland left him with a record of three victories from 11 games in major tournaments. A number of Premier League managers have being paying tribute to Hodgson in their pre-match news conferences. Arsenal boss Mikel Arteta said: ""He's an absolute legend. What he's done for football, for English football, what he transmits as a manager and what he has done at different clubs is remarkable. ""He has been doing it for so long with the way he is always conducting himself. It's a great example for me as a young coach. He is someone I admire."" Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp described Hodgson as ""one of the very, very greats of our business"", adding: ""I knew about him long before I met him and he is a really nice guy. I couldn't have more respect for him and what he has done."" Everton manager Carlo Ancelotti said: ""Roy is a good friend. He has had a fantastic career. In Italy they have good memories of him. ""He has helped football to be better and he also taught a lot of managers how to behave on and off the pitch."" Speaking before Hodgson confirmed his departure, former Blackburn striker Chris Sutton told BBC Radio 5 Live's Monday Night Club that his successor faced an ""impossible job"". ""You have to look at the job Roy has done there - they have always stayed up pretty comfortably,"" said Sutton. ""He is not everybody's cup of tea because of the brand of football but in terms of doing a job and keeping owners happy he is the perfect fit. ""The squad will need a big overhaul with so many players out of contract."" Former Australia goalkeeper Mark Schwarzer, who played under Hodgson at Fulham, told 5 Live: ""When you look at his time, especially at Inter Milan, the Italians were renowned for having that defensive system, being very rigid, very organised - and Roy loved that. ""When we started that at Fulham, players were pulling their hair out because the training sessions were monotonous. ""It wasn't until about two or three months into that time that players started to realise - the penny dropped - this is just building an incredibly stable foundation, one to build upon, to have that flexibility in the final third. ""I'm sure the Crystal Palace fans who will be in the stadium on Wednesday will show their appreciation. The players and the staff all speak incredibly highly of Roy Hodgson."" Frank Lampard, who was sacked as Chelsea boss in January, is the early bookmakers' favourite to succeed Hodgson.

"Some of the world's biggest firms have signed up to a campaign which aims to tackle prejudice towards disabled people in the business world. Companies with combined sales of more than $8 trillion and 20 million staff, including Apple, BP and Coca-Cola have joined the Valuable 500 initiative. But founder Caroline Casey said the campaign was not just about employing more people with disabilities. Firms are losing $13tn in sales by ignoring disabled consumers, she said. Ms Casey told the BBC: ""As we move out of this pandemic and we need to recover, why would any business look at leaving $13trn on the table?"" She told the BBC that in the UK one third of FTSE companies did not have a website that was ""acceptable to people with disabilities and their families. Why would you do that?"" Workers with Downâs syndrome: âWe feel safeâ 'So many people have told me I've given them confidence' Valuable 500 was launched at the 2019 World Economic Forum Meeting in Davos, with a goal of getting 500 international companies to commit to putting disability inclusion on their board agenda. At the time, it published research which said 56% of global company boards had never had a conversation about disability and this was ""leading to leaving disabilities on the sidelines of business"". According to figures released on Tuesday, there are no executives or senior managers at FTSE 100 companies who have disclosed a disability, and only 12% of firms report the number of their employees who are disclosed as disabled. The figures also show the average representation of people with disabilities among staff reported by FTSE 100 firms is just 3.2%. Other companies which have joined the Valuable 500 initiative include Google, Deloitte, Nestle, Microsoft and Unilever. All of them have have made a public commitment to advancing disability inclusion within their organisations, either among staff, customers or their supply chains. ""We have an inequality crisis facing the disability community which is just huge and it can't be resolved without business meeting meaningfully at the table,"" said Ms Casey. However, she stressed Valuable 500 was not just about recruiting. ""We're looking at driving systematic change in the business system [in terms of] customers and suppliers and talent."" ""If you want to be able to have access to that market you need to have that talent in your business and I think when we speak about disability business inclusions we always speak about employment and we forget the huge, huge value of this market globally."" Over the last year or so, Ms Casey said lockdown had helped show that the group's objectives were achievable. ""It's proved the business system can change, hasn't it? Look how quickly our systems had to change because they wanted to and we can't unknow what we now know. ""Our systems can flex and they can change and as we move out into recovery why would any business, an intelligent business leader, leave behind 15-20% of the global population. It would be madness absolute madness.""

Indoor entertainmentvenues in England, Wales and Scotland reopened on Monday. However, capacity is limited to 50%, or up to 1,000 people at most. Social distancing and face masks are still needed but ""Covid passports"" or proof of a negative test are not required to enter a venue in England. Deirdre Hargey is hopeful of attending cultural events in the summer Ms Hargey told BBC News NI the 25-strong taskforce would consider how venues in Northern Ireland could open safely to audiences from 21 June. ""We wanted to give that date so that it's something to work towards,"" she said. ""What I would like to see the task force do is how then we can open on 21 June safely. ""There are a number of pilots that are taking place in England, we're obviously getting information on that via the SAGE committee which the health minister and the chief medical officer sit on. ""We'll be monitoring those closely, and I want all of that to go through this taskforce. ""But also to look at the local knowledge and expertise here, people who run events, people who organise safety around key events in planning for coming into the summer season. ""But doing that in a safe way that keeps the opening long-term and sustainable."" NI festival organisers frustrated by dates delay Festivals warn of cancellations if no state aid 'We've lost so many people from the industry' The taskforce includes those who run festivals, music, theatre and arts venues and organisations. Ms Hargey said she also wanted to see live music resume ""as quickly and as safely as possible"". ""I want to get venues a bit of normality back,"" Ms Hargey said. ""We have obviously eased a good bit of restrictions around outdoor events and indoor events from next Monday. ""We want to build on that then to aim for 21 June to make sure that we can do that quickly and also as safely as possible."" However, the minister also said that if some restrictions on performances or audiences remained there would need to be further financial support for venues and those working in the sector. Ms Hargey was asked by BBC News NI if she expected to be able to go to a concert or performance this summer. ""I would hope to go to some type of concert or outdoor venue, 100%,"" she replied. ""I do hope through the taskforce and the work that we'll be doing with the executive that we can see that ray of sunshine over the summer season, and particularly during festival season."" Rotha Johnston is the chairwoman of the taskforce The chairwoman of the taskforce, Rotha Johnston, said its purpose was both ""recovery and re-opening in the short-term"". ""I think what the taskforce will want to look at are the measures that have been put in place for live performances across the water in England,"" she told BBC News NI. ""What can we learn from those measures and can they be applied safely here? ""We will be guided by the views from the executive and the guidelines in place at that time, but the sorts of issues we'll want to look at are in terms of capacity, in terms of social distancing, in terms of track and trace. ""But also for these organisations the viability - what does it mean for them opening in terms of those additional requirements. ""We'll want to look at every possibility.""

"UK job vacancies have hit their highest level since the start of the pandemic as the easing of lockdown measures has led employers to start recruiting. In the February-to-April period there were 657,000 vacancies, up about 48,400 on the previous quarter. The unemployment rate fell slightly to 4.8% in the three months to March, down from 4.9% in February,the Office for National Statistics said,external. The ONS said there were ""early signs of recovery"" in the jobs market, However, despite the rise in job vacancies over the past 12 months, the level remains almost 128,000 below its pre-pandemic level in the January-to-March quarter of 2020. The official figures confirm several reports in recent weeks by recruitment companies that they are seeing a rise in job advertisements, leading to concern among some employers that they could face staff shortages. UK economy set to grow at fastest rate in 70 years Are you currently unemployed? Emailhaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external The ONS said the number of workers on payrolls had risen by 97,000 between March and April, but was still 772,000 lower than before the pandemic struck. Darren Morgan, ONS director of economic statistics, said the number of employees on payroll ""rose strongly in April"" as the economy began to reopen, continuing an improvement from its November trough. But he said: ""There remains, however, three-quarters of a million people fewer on the payroll compared with the pre-pandemic peak. ""With many businesses reopening, the recent recovery in job vacancies continued into April, especially in sectors such as hospitality and entertainment."" Chancellor Rishi Sunak said the latest figures showed the impact of the government's focus on protecting jobs during the pandemic. ""While sadly not every job can be saved, nearly two million fewer people are now expected to be out of work than initially expected - showing our Plan for Jobs is working."" Business leaders welcomed the vacancy levels as positive signs for the economy, but warned there was still a long way to go. As many experts have pointed out, Tuesday's positive jobs news does not disguise that many people in the labour market are still struggling. Interior designer Sheila Smith lost her job working for hospitality venues in October - and despite some 500 applications is still unemployed. She worries that businesses are looking for someone younger and cheaper than her. ""I've been for a few interviews, which I haven't been successful at,"" she told the BBC. She said the most frustrating aspect of the job search was the lack of communication from potential employers. ""When you take time to go for a job interview, get yourself prepared, but then you hear nothing back - that's the most frustrating thing."" Although the number of job vacancies is rising, they are still well down on pre-pandemic levels and Sheila reckons there's about 200 people applying for each post advertised. ""It destroys your confidence,"" she said. ""I've worked solidly for years in the industry, and you find yourself in this situation scrambling for jobs. ""You feel like you're stuck at square one."" Matthew Percival, director of people and skills at the CBI business lobby group, said: ""Businesses are starting to report vacancies they're struggling to fill so government support for skills and retraining is essential."" He added that companies still needed clarity over the rules for the next stage of reopening the economy, which is currently planned for 21 June. Research consultancy Capital Economics said the fall in the jobless rate showed that the jobs furlough scheme was ""insulating the labour market"". The firm added that although it expects the unemployment rate to rise over the next few months, that would most likely be due to people returning to the labour market rather than people losing their jobs. The most encouraging sign here is that vacancies over the three months to April averaged 657,000. The ONS said its experimental monthly vacancy statistics for April itself were ""at near pre-pandemic levels"". There are increasing numbers of employers expressing concern about recruitment difficulties. The jobs data continue to show some signs of resilience and recovery, with unemployment down again to 4.8%, and employment up for the fifth consecutive month. It's so far a slow recovery based on gradual re-openings seen up until last month. The pattern is, though, as uneven as the lifting of the restrictions. Hospitality and retail jobs are still well down on pre-pandemic levels, and this means all of the loss in payrolled jobs and more can currently be explained by what has happened to young workers. There are still over four million workers on the furlough scheme, who count as employed. Are you currently unemployed? Share your experiences by emailinghaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external.

"Dr Khan before and after catching Covid, which caused him many symptoms including swollen eyelids A decision about whether key workers with long Covid should get compensation could take more than a year, government advisers have told the BBC. It comes after 65 MPs and peers wrote to Boris Johnson asking for the illness to be made an ""occupational disease"". More thana million people in the UK are thought to have long Covid, including over 120,000 healthcare workers. The government says it is committed to supporting people through the pandemic. Frontline key workers who believe they caught long Covid through their jobs are becoming increasingly worried about what financial support is available to them if they cannot return to work. Dr Asad Khan, a respiratory consultant in Manchester, was treating Covid patients every day using what he calls an ""abysmal"" level of personal protective equipment (PPE) because of ""inadequate"" government guidelines. He caught Covid in November and has now been off work for nearly six months with a number of debilitating symptoms - including extreme fatigue, heart palpitations and an inability to control his bodily functions. Long Covid: Why are some people not recovering? 'My fatigue was like nothing I've ever experienced before' He is currently on full sick pay which he has been told will last a year but, given the severity of his condition, he is already worried what will happen after that. ""Theoretically I could lose my job. I could be retired sick, which is a scary prospect,"" he said. He now wants the government to step in and provide financial support. ""There are tens of thousands of us who are living with the illness, unable to work, unable to function. ""We answered the call to action when we were needed, the decent thing to do now would be to ensure those of us who have acquired Covid as a result of increased exposure to the virus should be assured of some financial compensation."" While NHS staff with long Covid receive full pay for a year in England and Wales - and longer in Scotland and Northern Ireland - many in the private sector only get 28 weeks Statutory Sick Pay. Claire* was working with Covid patients in a care home in the East of England during the first wave and caught the illness last May. She has been unable to work since. When her six months Statutory Sick Pay ran out, she lost her job on capability grounds. A year on since becoming sick, with no prospect of returning to work - and no financial support - she told File on 4 she faces losing her home, and feels ""discarded"" by the government. ""They've paid all this money for people to stay at home on furlough and I can't claim a penny, that is quite an insult. I'm not asking for a lot and I'm hoping it won't be forever, but to just constantly be turned down for any financial help takes its toll."" ""We were 'heroes' for keeping the country going - all the key workers, shop workers and bus drivers - then I get ill, I can't work and they don't want to know, they don't care. I just need some help."" Liberal Democrat MP Layla Moran, who chairs the All Party Parliamentary Group on Coronavirus, said she wants long Covid to be classed as an 'occupational disease' which would allow sufferers to be awarded a benefit according to their degree of disability - called an Industrial Injuries Disablement Benefit (IIDB). ""These are the very people we should be supporting the most - they aren't just the people who went out and did the jobs that needed to be done, they are also the people that got sick from it. ""It is only right the government now looks after their lives if they've been affected by long Covid - that they are compensated and this would be according to their need at the time."" But the body which advises the government whether it should classify an illness as an 'occupational disease' has told File on 4 such a recommendation could take a year. Dr Lesley Rushton, who chairs the Industrial Injuries Advisory Council (IIAC), says they are hampered by a lack of research and data and whilst they realise some occupations are more risky than others, a major issue is proving someone got Covid through their work. ""For some diseases it's very clear cut, you can only get the exposure at a particular workplace, doing a particular type of work"" she said. ""But with coronavirus, it has the same effect whether or not the exposure has arisen at work or outside work."" Once a recommendation has been made to the government, it would then have to go through parliament to be become legislation. Layla Moran believes the government now needs to step in whilst the IIAC gathers evidence. A government spokesperson said: ""This government is committed to supporting people throughout this pandemic and provides a strong financial safety net for those in need. ""Covid-19 is still a relatively new disease and to better understand the long-term effects we are providing over Â£50m for research funding and working with world-leading scientists to better understand the virus so we can ensure we have the best treatments available.""

"Even when students are back on campus, their lectures might still be online A number of UK universities are preparing to keep lectures online into the autumn term. It raises the prospect of Covid disrupting another academic year - and will prompt more questions about fee refunds. Students have called plans for another term of online lectures ""unacceptable"". ""Online teaching is in no way a substitute for in-person learning,"" says a petition launched by University of Leeds students. About half of students in England have only been able to return to face-to-face teaching this week, not long before the term ends - having been taught online since Christmas. But a growing number of universities seem to be anticipating carrying on with a mix of online and in-person teaching into the autumn term. Students off since Christmas are back in May Students feel 'afterthought' in return plans University pays back Â£5k for 'less valuable' experience The University of Liverpool says it wants as ""much face-to-face teaching as possible"", but is expecting a blend of online and in-person. ""In practice this may mean instead of coming on to campus for lectures you may be asked to watch some short pre-recorded videos created by your tutor which cover the same themes and topics as the original lecture,"" says Liverpool's plan for teaching next year. Many students have returned this week having been studying online since Christmas A University of Leeds spokesman said: ""We intend to give every student a substantial on-campus experience throughout next semester, including multiple face-to-face sessions each week."" But many lectures ""will be delivered online as part of an overall hybrid approach"". Keeping lectures online prompted an angry response from some students, who started a petition saying that it was ""ridiculous"" and a ""disgrace"" - and calling for a ""complete return to in-person teaching"". Supporters of the petition complained about the Â£9,250 tuition fees being charged and that many students have had very few hours of in-person teaching this year. ""Now children are in school full time, people are back in the workplace and the general public can visit pubs, theatres and cinemas... there is absolutely no need for any lectures to remain online,"" wrote a petitioner. ""My daughter has had an awful year stuck in her roomâ¦ Get a grip please,"" wrote a parent backing the petition. The students' union at Leeds says it is planning a survey of students' experience of online learning this year and what they want for next year. The previous two academic years have been disrupted - with many students having to spend months off campus - but it seems as though the pandemic could mean a third year of changes. Even if students are back on campus they could still be watching lectures online. The London School of Economics expects the ""vast majority"" of seminars and classes to be taught in-person, but lectures will be ""largely delivered online"". St Andrews and the University of Edinburgh expect large lectures to be online - and the University of Manchester is planning a ""blended approach, with a mix of both on-campus and online elements"". St Andrews says this ""interim"" guidance reflects the ""significant uncertainty"" about physical distancing requirements in the autumn. University College London says courses on campus would ""prioritise interactive face-to-face teaching, such as seminars and workshops"". But some modules ""will be mostly online and others completely online if all learning outcomes can be met this way"", says the information for next year's students. An academic at a London university, speaking anonymously, contacted the BBC to suggest there would be financial savings for universities from reducing staffing levels and making a longer-term shift to keeping lectures online. But the National Union of Students also said there could be some positive advantages in teaching online. ""Online lectures, remote access to resources and other digital provision has significantly improved access to education and, offered alongside in-person teaching, gives students greater choice over how they learn,"" said union vice president, Hillary Gyebi-Ababio. ""No matter what teaching methods universities and colleges use, they must provide consistently good courses for all students,"" said Nicola Dandridge, chief executive of the Office for Students. Universities had to provide ""timely and clear information for students on how their courses will be taught next year"", she said. A spokeswoman for Universities UK said universities were trying to plan without knowing what restrictions will be in place in the autumn - and that even if lectures were online, students would still have access to facilities such as libraries and laboratories. ""Universities have a strong track record in delivering excellent blended tuition, and we have been clear that quality and quantity should not drop,"" said a Department for Education spokeswoman.

"There have been long queues for Covid vaccines in Bolton, where the spread of the Indian variant is being studied There is ""nothing conclusive"" in the data that means England ""would have to deviate from the roadmap"" out of lockdown, Boris Johnson has said. The government plans to end remaining legal limits on social contact from 21 June, but there is increasing concern about the Indian variant. The situation, including data from hotspots such as Bolton, was ""under close review"", the prime minister said. Ministers will ""let people know in a few days' time"" after data is studied. Speaking on a visit to a vaccination centre in London, Mr Johnson continued to urge people to be cautious. He said the situation with the Indian variant was ""under very careful, close review"", saying: ""We're looking at all the data as it comes in from places like Bolton, Blackburn, Bedford, Sefton."" Mr Johnson said they were trying to understand if the Indian variant was more transmissible and ""to what extent our vaccine programme has sufficiently fortified us"". ""We've got a few more days of looking at that data,"" he said. It comes as the UK recorded another seven deaths within 28 days of a positive test and 2,412 new cases. Why is the UK taking a risk with the Indian variant? Why is the India variant causing concern in the UK? On Monday the government said 86 local councils in England had five or more cases of the variant first discovered in India, which is thought to be more transmissible. In Bolton, a new vaccine centre has opened up and ministers have been stepping up calls for people to book vaccinations as soon as they are offered appointments. Elsewhere, regional public health directors are concerned about rising cases of the variant in London. Cases have spread across a number of boroughs, although currently most are linked to foreign travel. The prime minister's official spokesman said that while the government was not ruling out measures such as local lockdowns at this stage, it was ""too early to speculate"" on what future measures it may need to take. Asked if a decision was expected sooner than 14 June on progressing to the final step of England's roadmap, the spokesman said that in relation to certification and social distancing, ministers ""do want to update pubs and businesses, if possible, before 14 June"". But he added they needed to ""allow the experts to do their work"" and ""couldn't be more specific on timings"". Day by day the scientists are learning more about the Indian variant - and the implications for the UK. On Friday it was reported the variant could be 50% more transmissible than the UK variant, which was responsible for the deadly winter wave. But confidence in that figure was always a little shaky. In the past few days there are some tentative signs its advantage over the UK variant may not be so great. That's important. There's estimated to be an eight-fold difference between the impact in terms of hospital admissions a variant with a 20% advantage will have compared to one with a 50% advantage. That clearly has a major implication for what restrictions are needed while the vaccination programme continues to be rolled out. The next significant update is expected on Thursday. It will be too soon for a definitive answer, but it should help us understand more about what the variant means for the UK. Read more from Nick The government has already warned its next review ofsocial distancing rules- set to take place by the end of May - may be delayed because of concern over the variant. On Monday millions of people were able to enjoy new freedoms - such as drinking indoors in pubs, hugs with loved ones and foreign holidays - for the first time in months, under the latestrelaxation of rulesacross England, Wales and most of Scotland. Boris Johnson visited a vaccination centre at the Business Design Centre in Islington, London However, Labour has accused the government of ""giving out conflicting and confused advice"" about travel to countries on the amber travel list, where people must quarantine for up to 10 days on their return to the UK. Government guidance,externalstates people should not travel to amber list countries. But earlier Environment Secretary George Eustice suggested in a BBC interview that people could travel to such destinations if they ""feel the need"" to visit family or friends. Asked about the issue,Mr Johnson saidit was ""very important people grasp what the amber list is - not somewhere to go on holiday"". He said travellers should only go to these countries for ""pressing family or business reasons"". Those who break their self-isolation period on returning to the UK from these destinations face Â£10,000 fines, he added. Yvette Cooper, who chairs the Commons Home Affairs Committee, said the current traffic light system was ""very messy"" and ""clearly isn't working"", adding that it should be linked to legal restrictions. ""We all seem to be in a position where the government has opened up to summer holiday travel by accident, by making it possible, but at the same time, a day later, saying 'no, people should not be travelling to amber countries,'"" the Labour MP told BBC Radio 4's World at One programme. LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? LOCKDOWN RULES:What are they and when will they end? TRAVEL:Which countries are on the green list? Meanwhile, Prof Andrew Pollard, director of the Oxford Vaccine Group, which developed the AstraZeneca vaccine,has said it feels ""morally wrong"" that children in some richer countries are being offered a Covid-19 jab before some high-risk people in poorer countries. He told the All Party Parliamentary Group on coronavirus: ""There are many unvaccinated people in the world whilst people whose risk is extremely low are being vaccinated, including children who have near to zero the risk of severe disease or death.

"Traditionally, the biggest use of plastics is in packaging and it tends to be used just once before being thrown away Just 20 companies are the source of more than half of all the single-use plastic items thrown away globally. That's the conclusion of analysis of the corporate network behind plastic production. The study looked at approximately 1,000 factories that make the raw materials needed for single-use products. Plastic bottles, food packages and bags are among billions of items that are used once and then thrown away, often ending up in the oceans. The research - carried out by a consortium including the London School of Economics -looked at which companies are at the base of the plastic supply chain,externaland make polymers, the building blocks of all plastics. It names 20 petrochemical companies which it says are the source of 55 per cent of the world's single-use plastic waste. The companies include ExxonMobil, Dow and Sinopec. Food giants respond to worries over packaging China gets tough on firms over single-use plastics 'Staggering' levels of plastic pollution by 2040 UK criticised for dumping plastic waste in Turkey The study also assesses which countries generate most single-use plastic waste, based on per head of population. The UK comes in fourth, with more than 40kg of plastic waste generated per person per year, the authors state, while Australia is top and the United States second. Part of the increase in demand for plastic stems from the need for masks and other protective and medical equipment to deal with the Covid crisis. Previous research has focused on the impact of plastic waste on the natural world, or on the consumer companies making and selling consumer products packaged in plastic. By contrast, this analysis tracks the flow of plastic through the supply chain, starting with the manufacturers of the basic ingredients that go into making single use items. Those ingredients, known as polymers, are mostly produced by processing fossil fuels including oil, gas and coal. This video can not be played Planet and Plastic: End of the Love Story? The research was led by Australia's Minderoo Foundation and a consortium including LSE, market researchers Wood Mackenzie and the Stockholm Environment Institute. US-based ExxonMobil is the biggest producer of single-use plastic, the report says, followed by: Dow, Sinopec, Indorama Ventures, Saudi Aramco, PetroChina, LyondellBasell, Reliance Industries, Braskem, Alpek SA de CV, Borealis, Lotte Chemical, INEOS, Total, Jiangsu Hailun Petrochemical, Far Eastern New Century, Formosa Plastics Corporation, China Energy Investment Group, PTT and China Resources. According to the foundation's director of finance and transparency, Dominic Charles, the research highlights ""how the future of the plastic waste crisis is in the hands of just 20 companies"". He says: ""It's an extraordinary point of leverage for regulators, for finance institutions, to influence them in order that rather than producing from fossil fuels, they produce plastic that's recycled."" He adds that until now the emphasis of efforts to curb plastic pollution has been on the individual choices that consumers can make. ""But we need to go after the tap, to turn off the tap of fossil fuel plastics and we need to create plastics from recycled material."" The report finds that plastic production is set to expand by 30% in the next five years, increasing carbon emissions as well as creating more plastic waste. One of the contributors is Prof Sam Fankhauser, a specialist in climate change economics at the University of Oxford and the London School of Economics. He observes: ""Our reliance on oil and gas is not only fuelling climate change, but as the primary material used in the production of throwaway plastics also devastating our oceans. ""It is critically important petrochemical companies move towards circular economy-based alternatives if we are going to successfully tackle these interlinked crises. ""The benefits on offer are transformative and hugely beneficial, not only for our environment and ecosystems but also the communities living with the realities of plastic pollution."" This video can not be played The beach cleaners battling a tide of plastic The world's largest producer of plastic polymers, ExxonMobil, says it shares society's concerns about plastic waste. In a statement, it said: ""ExxonMobil is taking action to address plastic waste by increasing plastic recyclability, supporting improvements in plastic waste recovery - for example, through our founding membership in the Alliance to End Plastic Waste - and minimizing plastic pellet loss from our operations. ""We are also working on advanced recycling solutions that create and capture value from plastic waste with opportunities for lower overall greenhouse gas emissions over the full life cycle of the plastic."" Another large polymer producer, Ineos, was also asked for comment. According to its website, the company is working on ways to chemically recycle plastic, adding that ""the holy grail of plastic recycling is fast becoming a reality and will mean we can reduce our reliance on fossil fuels to make our products"". It comes asGreenpeace reported yesterdaythat plastic waste collected for recycling from British households had been found dumped in Turkey.

"Even when students are back on campus, their lectures might still be online A number of UK universities are preparing to keep lectures online into the autumn term. It raises the prospect of Covid disrupting another academic year - and will prompt more questions about fee refunds. Students have called plans for another term of online lectures ""unacceptable"". ""Online teaching is in no way a substitute for in-person learning,"" says a petition launched by University of Leeds students. About half of students in England have only been able to return to face-to-face teaching this week, not long before the term ends - having been taught online since Christmas. But a growing number of universities seem to be anticipating carrying on with a mix of online and in-person teaching into the autumn term. Students off since Christmas are back in May Students feel 'afterthought' in return plans University pays back Â£5k for 'less valuable' experience The University of Liverpool says it wants as ""much face-to-face teaching as possible"", but is expecting a blend of online and in-person. ""In practice this may mean instead of coming on to campus for lectures you may be asked to watch some short pre-recorded videos created by your tutor which cover the same themes and topics as the original lecture,"" says Liverpool's plan for teaching next year. Many students have returned this week having been studying online since Christmas A University of Leeds spokesman said: ""We intend to give every student a substantial on-campus experience throughout next semester, including multiple face-to-face sessions each week."" But many lectures ""will be delivered online as part of an overall hybrid approach"". Keeping lectures online prompted an angry response from some students, who started a petition saying that it was ""ridiculous"" and a ""disgrace"" - and calling for a ""complete return to in-person teaching"". Supporters of the petition complained about the Â£9,250 tuition fees being charged and that many students have had very few hours of in-person teaching this year. ""Now children are in school full time, people are back in the workplace and the general public can visit pubs, theatres and cinemas... there is absolutely no need for any lectures to remain online,"" wrote a petitioner. ""My daughter has had an awful year stuck in her roomâ¦ Get a grip please,"" wrote a parent backing the petition. The students' union at Leeds says it is planning a survey of students' experience of online learning this year and what they want for next year. The previous two academic years have been disrupted - with many students having to spend months off campus - but it seems as though the pandemic could mean a third year of changes. Even if students are back on campus they could still be watching lectures online. The London School of Economics expects the ""vast majority"" of seminars and classes to be taught in-person, but lectures will be ""largely delivered online"". St Andrews and the University of Edinburgh expect large lectures to be online - and the University of Manchester is planning a ""blended approach, with a mix of both on-campus and online elements"". St Andrews says this ""interim"" guidance reflects the ""significant uncertainty"" about physical distancing requirements in the autumn. University College London says courses on campus would ""prioritise interactive face-to-face teaching, such as seminars and workshops"". But some modules ""will be mostly online and others completely online if all learning outcomes can be met this way"", says the information for next year's students. An academic at a London university, speaking anonymously, contacted the BBC to suggest there would be financial savings for universities from reducing staffing levels and making a longer-term shift to keeping lectures online. But the National Union of Students also said there could be some positive advantages in teaching online. ""Online lectures, remote access to resources and other digital provision has significantly improved access to education and, offered alongside in-person teaching, gives students greater choice over how they learn,"" said union vice president, Hillary Gyebi-Ababio. ""No matter what teaching methods universities and colleges use, they must provide consistently good courses for all students,"" said Nicola Dandridge, chief executive of the Office for Students. Universities had to provide ""timely and clear information for students on how their courses will be taught next year"", she said. A spokeswoman for Universities UK said universities were trying to plan without knowing what restrictions will be in place in the autumn - and that even if lectures were online, students would still have access to facilities such as libraries and laboratories. ""Universities have a strong track record in delivering excellent blended tuition, and we have been clear that quality and quantity should not drop,"" said a Department for Education spokeswoman.

"There were more than a million hospital admissions for obesity-related treatment in England in the year leading into the global pandemic, figures reveal. The record number provides the clearest indication yet of the scale of the obesity problem as coronavirus started to spread across the UK. Being overweight is one of the most significant risk factors for severe Covid. Experts say the data should be a wake-up call for tackling obesity. The figures, published by NHS Digital, show a 17% increase in hospital admissions where obesity was a factor, compared with the year before. This amounts to almost 150,000 more instances of people being admitted to hospital over the course of a year. The number of admissions where obesity was recorded as the main cause actually fell to 10,780 last year, from 11,117 in 2018-19. But this is mainly due to a fall in the number of bariatric surgeries (including gastric bands and bypasses) being performed. Women accounted for two-thirds (64%) of admissions where obesity was a factor. Naveed Sattar, professor of metabolic medicine, at the University of Glasgow, says obesity is ""the strongest risk factor for [Type 2] diabetes"". ""It's a strong risk factor for heart disease, for heart failure, for lung disease, for kidney disease, for multiple other conditions,"" he says. ""If we now add to that obesity is a strong risk factor for this acute viral pandemic which is killing people worldwide, then... this is a wake-up call. ""Many health systems and government really do now need to pay attention to obesity. ""We do need to tackle obesity and we need to take it seriously."" 'They told me I could die' At his heaviest, Phil Skeates weighed 25 stone (159kg). And when he developed coronavirus, last year, he ended up needing intensive care. ""It was horrible,"" Mr Skeates says. ""I was blue-lighted. ""As I was taken out of the house, I said goodbye to my wife. ""I was crying my eyes out in the ambulance. ""It was heartbreaking. ""My thoughts were I may not see her again. ""They'd actually told me if I caught Covid, there was every chance that I would die."" ""On the ward, I saw two people pass away. ""It was a massive massive point. ""It really made me think I need to address this."" Phil has now lost more than six stone. ""I paid the price,"" he says. ""I've come through it and I'm not going back."" Scientists are still trying to understand why the coronavirus poses such a risk to those significantly overweight. Prof Sattar says there is some evidence heavier people have a higher viral load or more virus in their bodies than others and the virus triggers a dangerous response by the immune system. ""There may be a critical interaction between fat cells and the immune response which increases the likelihood of that immune response being exaggerated and harmful,"" he says. ""We also know that people who are heavier have thicker blood to begin with, and this hyper-response thickens the blood even more. ""So the likelihood is that this thickness will clot off blood vessels and block blood vessels. ""People who are overweight, effectively have less capacity to deal with the damage Covid causes."" And for many people, the pandemic has led to weight gain, early evidence suggests. NHS England medical director Professor Stephen Powis said: ""Today's shocking figures are a growing sign of the nation's obesity crisis which is putting hundreds of thousands of people at greater risk of becoming severely ill with Covid, as well as heart attacks, stroke, cancer and other deadly diseases"". This is a real concern, Susan Jebb, professor of diet and population, at Oxford University, says. ""People have gained 2-3kg but that is very unevenly spread - some people have gained much more,"" she says. ""And it seems to be a particular problem for women, for younger people and for those living in deprived areas."" Pressure is piling on the government to take radical action to address the obesity problem. Last month, doctors, academics, campaigners and public-sector experts wrote to the prime minister, urging him to stick to a landmark government proposal to ban junk-food advertising online and on social media - after fears it could be ditched. The government says it has a clear plan to introduce a ban on junk-food adverts on television before 21:00. It has now finished a consultation with industry and how far it is prepared to go with restrictions online will be revealed in the next few weeks.

"President Biden and First Lady Jill Biden's income fell last year compared with 2019 Joe Biden has brought back a US presidential tradition by releasing his tax return, the White House said. The filing shows he and his wife earned $607,336 (Â£430,000) last year and paid $157,414 in federal income tax. Their income fell from 2019 when they earned $985,223 mostly from speeches, book sales and positions at higher education institutions. Donald Trump refused to release his tax returns, the first president not to do so since the Watergate era. Mr Trump claimed he was not able to do so as he was being audited by the Internal Revenue Service, the US government's tax-collection agency. What you need to know about the Trump tax story Ahead of the tax filing's release on Monday, White House press secretary Jen Psaki said: ""I would expect that we will continue to release the president's tax returns, as should be expected by every president of the United States."" Throwing down the gauntlet to Mr Trump ahead of the 2020 election, Mr Biden released 22 years of tax filings. The document, released on Monday, shows that during the busy election campaign year the Bidens paid a federal income tax rate of 25.9%, the White House said. They also donated $30,704 to 10 charities in 2020. The biggest sum of $10,000 went to the Beau Biden Foundation, which campaigns against child abuse and is named after the president's son, who died aged 46 in 2015 of brain cancer. Joe and Jill Biden's previous tax returns have shown they donated $70,000 to charity in total over the two decades leading up to 2017. The Bidens also have assets of between $1.2m and $2.88m, according to their financial disclosure form released on Monday. During last year's presidential race, Mr Biden's campaign said he and his wife made $11m in 2017 and $4.6m the year after. The couple's previous tax filings have shown how they were able to lower their tax bill by funnelling book and speech income through so-called S Corporations, thereby benefiting from a tax loophole that the Obama administration - in which Mr Biden served as vice-president - tried and failed to close. Mr Biden's current salary as president is $400,000. The Democratic president is proposing tax rises on Americans who earn more than $400,000 in order to help fund one of the biggest expansions of the welfare state in decades and a wide-ranging jobs plan. US Vice-President Kamala Harris and her husband Doug Emhoff also released their joint tax return for 2020. It showed they had reported a federal adjusted gross income of $1,695,225, said the White House. The couple paid $621,893 in federal income tax, amounting to a 2020 effective federal income tax rate of 36.7%.Â They gave $27,006 to charity. Ms Harris received an advance of $359,000 for her book, The Truths We Hold. Before the election, Mr Emhoff was a partner in entertainment and intellectual property at multinational law firm DLA Piper.

"Israel's military is preparing for an ""intensive"" night of strikes in Gaza, Israeli media report Air strikes and rocket fire claimed more lives on Tuesday In one incident, rockets fired from Gaza into Israel killed two workers from Thailand Following attacks from militants Israel closes a crossing into Gaza which opened briefly to allow in aid Palestinians and Israeli Arabs have been holding a general strike President Biden has joined calls for a ceasefire between Israel and Palestinian militants The violence has entered its second week and killed more than 200 people in Gaza and 12 in Israel Edited by Rebecca Seales We're now pausing our live coverage of the ongoing Israel-Gaza conflict - many thanks for staying with us. To recap, here are the key developments from the past 24 hours: Family and friends attend the funeral of Yigal Yehoshua, a Jewish man killed in clashes with Israeli Arabs The funeral has taken place of a Jewish man who died after sustaining serious injuries during violence between Israeli Arabs and Jews in Israel's central city of Lod last week. Mourners attended the service for Yigal Yehoshua, 56, who was hit in the head by a large rock or brick thrown by protesters while driving home in Lod, a city not far from Tel Aviv, on 11 May. Yehoshua was taken to hospital for treatment, but later died of his injuries. A mourner drapes himself with an Israeli flag At least 12 people were reportedly injured in the clashes that day, which followed the funeral of an Israeli Arab man who died during unrest in the city a day earlier. The BBC's Rushdi Abualouf in Gaza shared this video showing collapsed buildings on a major street there. Trees line one side of the road, while the other is scarred by rubble and twisted metal.

The Palestinian health ministry said 72 Palestinians are receiving treatment for injuries Two more Palestinians have died after they were hit by live fire during clashes with Israeli security forces in the West Bank, the Palestinian health ministry has said. The ministry said three Palestinians have now died and 72 were injured - five critically - after today's unrest in the area. The violence came as Palestinians across the West Bank and in east Jerusalem observed a general strike in support of those under bombardment in the Gaza Strip. Israeli's military is yet to comment on the three deaths. But in an earlier statement, the Israeli army said its soldiers ""responded with fire"" after ""a number of rioters fired extensively"" at them near Ramallah. ""Two soldiers were injured in their legs, and were evacuated to a hospital for further medical treatment,"" the military said. BBC OS The BBC OS radio show on the World Service has
been speaking to people across Israel and Gaza to hear their stories and
experiences. Today they spoke to a Jewish
Israeli mother in the city of Lod, which has seen unrest and violence. Katy Berman, a mother of seven and teacher: ""I personally did not leave the house for 4 days, I was so
scared, scared I would get a rock thrown through my car window, scared someone
would ambush me... ""When I met my (Arab) neighbour we spoke about how we felt
the night before when we were woke up umpteen times by the sirens. Because
rockets are coming, and on top of the rioting weâre having rockets sent over by
Hamas in Gaza. So we spoke as two mothers you know, âhow did you sleep at
night?â and âhow did your kids sleep at night', and how scary is it. ""My older kids are very worried about the situation,
theyâre worried in the way they wish they were here and could help and do
something. With my younger kids, they donât really know whatâs going onâ¦.. Iâm
not sure what to tell them, Iâm not sure what theyâll understand, how theyâll
go in the street â I donât want them to be scared."" Israeli reports say the military has issued new safety rules for the West Bank Israel's military has enacted emergency security rules in parts of the West Bank, reports say. The Times of Israel newspaper said,externalthe military had declared a âspecial situationâ in several areas, citing the threat of rocket fire. It said the declaration was not related to unrest in the West Bank, which has seen violent confrontations between Palestinians and Israeli police today. Under the rules, schools, universities and workplaces will only be allowed to remain open if they are in the vicinity of a protective area,according to another Israeli newspaper, the Jerusalem Post,external. The paper said Elkana, Karnei Shomron, and Oranit were among the areas where these rules would apply. It did not specify when they would come into force or how long they would apply for. The EU's foreign affairs chief, Josep Borrell, called for an ""immediate cessation of all violence"" Hungary has refused to back a European Union statement that called for a ceasefire between Israel and the Palestinians. Hungary's foreign minister Peter Szijjarto dismissed the EU's statement on Israel as ""one-sided"". ""I have a general problem with these European statements on Israel,"" Szijjarto told the AFP news agency. He said ""these statements do not help, especially not under current circumstances, when the tension is so high."" His comments came after the EU's foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, called for an ""immediate cessation of all violence and the implementation of a ceasefire"". Borrell said the statement was backed by all EU member states except Hungary. In recent years Hungary has been one of Israel's staunchest supporters in Europe. It has blocked several EU efforts to criticise Israeli policies, such as the US move to recognise Jerusalem as Israel's capital. Palestinian militants can move fast inside their underground tunnel network (file photo) Israel's military is preparing to strikemore targets linked to the Palestinian group Hamas's network of underground tunnels,externalin Gaza, the Jerusalem Post reports. The newspaper quotes Israel Defense Forces (IDF) spokesman Brig Gen Hidai Zilberman as describing ""an intensive night ahead of us"" as its operations look to strike ""new locations"". The IDF said it had struck dozens of ""terror targets"" and had already destroyed more than 15km (9.3 miles) of an underground tunnel network belonging to Hamas. Tunnel systems used by Hamas fighters have long been an important target for Israeli air raids. Earlier today, Brig Gen Zilberman told Israel's Army Radio that the IDF was ""not talking about a
ceasefire"", adding: ""We're focused on the firing."" A large blaze has broken out at a paint warehouse in the town of Rafah in Gaza following a reported Israeli strike. Eyewitnesses said a shell had hit the property on Tuesday afternoon, Reuters reports. It is not clear why the warehouse would have been targeted. Images show firefighters tackling the blaze while workers attempt to rescue stored items. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu spoke at an air base Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has reaffirmed his government's commitment to its operations against Palestinian militants in Gaza. Speaking at an air base a short time ago, Netanyahu said Israel would continue striking targets there ""for as long as necessary to restore quiet to the citizens of Israel"". He said Hamas, the militant group that rules Gaza, had ""received blows it did not expect"", setting it back by ""years"". ""Our enemies around us can see what price we exact for attacks against us,"" Netanyahu said. The Times of Israel newspaper said,externalrocket alarms sounded at the base near Beersheba during Netanyahuâs visit. Mustafa Barghouti, the West Bank-based leader of the
Palestinian National Initiative political party, tells BBC World News: âPalestinians
are ready for a ceasefire; itâs Israel that is abstaining from a ceasefire.â Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu wants to end rocket
attacks by Hamas and other Palestinian militant groups in Gaza and says its air
strikes will continue for âas long as it takes in order to
restore calm for all of Israelâs citizensâ. âIf Israel wants to keep shooting and throwing rockets
with their F-16 jet fightersâ¦ and wants Palestinians not to defend themselves, of
course that will not happen,â Mr Barghouti says. âA ceasefire means that nobody
will send rockets - that nobody will shoot on both sides.â This video can not be played Dr Barghouti: Ceasefire needs both sides not to shoot Germany has pledged â¬40m ($48.9m; Â£34.4m) in humanitarian aid for civilians in Gaza. According to the UN more than 52,000 Palestinians have been displaced by the current violence. German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas said he would ""lobby for a better humanitarian supply in Gaza"" at a meeting of EU member states today. He also condemned rocket attacks on Israel from Hamas, and stressed that Israel had the right to defend itself. A Palestinian protester has been killed in clashes with
Israeli security forces on the outskirts of the city of Ramallah, in
the occupied West Bank, according to the Palestinian health ministry. The ministry said the 25-year-old man was shot in the
chest at the entrance to al-Bireh. Another 50 people were
injured, five of them seriously, it added. The Palestinian news agency Wafa reported,externalthat Israeli
forces fired live rounds, rubber-coated bullets and tear gas during a protest against Israelâs air strikes on the Gaza Strip and its actions against
Palestinians elsewhere. Palestinian factions had called for a ""day of rage"". The Israeli military said ""a number of rioters fired extensively"" at its soldiers near Ramallah, and that they ""responded with fire"".
   ""Two soldiers were injured in their legs, and were evacuated to a hospital for further medical treatment,"" it added. There were also clashes between protesters and Israeli forces
in Bethlehem, where the health ministry said nine people were injured, and in occupied East Jerusalem. A Norwegian aid group has been powerfully drawing attention to the deaths of children in the conflict, noting that a number of young people killed in Gaza were directly receiving its help.

""We are devastated to learn that... children we were helping with trauma were bombarded while they were at home and thought they were safe,"" the head of the Norwegian Refugee Council, Jan Egeland, added. At least two Israeli children have been killed by rockets fired from Gaza by Hamas militants since the start of this latest conflict - and Israel says many more are living in fear. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken has denied the US is obstructing diplomacy, after the country refused to back a UN Security Council declaration on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. China has accused the US of hindering the Council's efforts to speak with ""one voice"". But Blinken insists the US is ""engaged in quiet, but very intensive diplomacy"". He said: ""... Would any given action or any given statement actually advance the goal of ending the violence?"" ""If we think, going forward, that there's something, including at the United Nations, that would actually effectively advance the objective, we would be for it,"" he said. The UN Security Council is due to meet for a fourth emergency session later on Tuesday. German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Jordanâs King
Abdullah II have called for a âspeedyâ ceasefire to end the hostilities between
Israel and Palestinian militants in Gaza. Mrs Merkelâs spokesman said
that both leaders had âagreed that initiatives for a speedy ceasefire should be
supported in order to create the conditions for the resumption of political
negotiationsâ. French Prime Minister Jean Castex also called for an
immediate end to the violence and urged
Israel to guarantee unhindered access for aid to Gaza. Egypt has sent 65 tonnes of medical aid to neighbouring Gaza, as the fighting in the region shows no sign of easing. It comes after the UN said at least six hospitals in the territory had been damaged since the conflict erupted more than a week ago. Healthcare and other services have also been disrupted by frequent power cuts. The only coronavirus-testing laboratory in Gaza - which has one of the highest rates of positive tests in the world - was knocked out on Monday. The supplies sent by Egypt include specialist burns treatment materials as well as ""ventilators, oxygen tanks [and] syringes,"" Health Minister Hala Zayed said. Rockets fired from Gaza fly towards Israel (file photo) We earlier posted on reports that Palestinian rockets launched into southern Israel had struck a packaging factory in the Eshkol region and killed two Thai workers. Thailand's foreign ministry has now confirmed that two of its citizens died - while eight others were wounded - in the attack at 14:50 local time (11:50 GMT) some 14km (about nine miles) from the border with Gaza. The two Thai men had been working at the Obad farming estate in Eshkol town, the ministry said. One eyewitness, Adirek Jinseng, a Thai worker at the estate, told the BBC's Thai service that the attack happened as people were resting during their lunch break. ""I heard two explosions in the sky, but there was no warning siren. More than 10 workers then rushed... to hide in the bunkers,"" Adirek said, adding that he saw one person killed at the scene and several others with serious injuries. A senior Thai diplomat in Israel told the BBC that around 4,000 of the country's citizens had been working within a 100km radius of Gaza. Some were relocated to safer areas over the weekend. These Palestinian children fled their homes and sought refuge at a UN-run school in Gaza City A member of the UN's relief agency for Palestinian refugees (Unrwa) has told the BBC that civilians in Gaza are ""terrified"". ""For me, this has for a couple of days now felt like a full-scale war,"" says Matthias Schmale, who is in charge of the Unrwa's operations in the territory. Some 48,000 people are seeking shelter in 58 of the agency's schools, he says. ""I heard that at least 8,000 people no longer have a home they can go to because itâs either totally destroyed or severely damaged, and then of course we have people killed. ""We have a terrified population worried where the next strike, where the next bomb is going to fall from."" This video can not be played Mark Regev, a senior advisor to Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu, has told the BBC that Israel is looking for ""sustainable peace"" rather than a short-term fix. Regev said such a fix would just become a ""prescription for another Gaza war a month from now"". ""We want to come out of this with a solution that will bring a sustainable period of peace and quiet,"" he said. ""Not some quick fix that will fall apart very quickly."" Â© 2025 BBC.

Speaking on the sharp rise in areas such as Bolton, Dr Chan told 5 Liveâs Nicky Campbell that we need to understand the reasons people havenât take up the vaccine instead of passing moral judgement on them. ""If youâre finger-pointing and labelling, calling people selfish or irresponsible, we know that kind of language, that kind of tactic is divisive, itâs polarising,"" she said.

About 150 flights a day are heading to countries the government advises against travelling to Earlier, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said that people should only travel to countries on the amber list in the government's traffic-light system if they have a ""pressing reason"" and not for a holiday. Underthe traffic light system, people can travel to countries on the green list without quarantine, must self-isolate for 10 days after visiting amber list countries, and must stay in government-mandated hotel quarantine if they visit a red list country. Although from yesterday it is no longer illegal, the government still advises people not to travel to countries on the amber list. Reporters had questioned the PM on why there were 150 flights a day heading to amber list countries and whether Environment Secretary George Eustice was wrong to suggest this morning that people could travel to visit friends and family ""if they feel the need"". Labour's shadow home secretary says ministers are ""giving out conflicting and confused adviceâ and repeats the party's call to pause international travel. He says the government's travel policies have âunravelled into dangerous chaos within a matter of hoursâ. Chris JeavansBBC News The variant first discovered in India can be found across England, but there are only a small number of hotspots. The most up-to-date data, covering the week up to Saturday 8 May, shows that most of the local authorities in England that have found a case havenât found many. Theyâre shown by the light blue areas in this map. There are a small number of places that have seen high numbers of the variant: Bolton, Blackburn with Darwen, Sefton and Bedford. Theyâre among the areas with the highest numbers of cases in the UK, fuelling concerns that this version of coronavirus may spread more quickly than the Kent strain that has been dominant since December. But scientists advising the government say itâs too soon to know one way or the other and that theyâll be working hard over the coming weeks to answer that question. Travelling is dangerous and ""not for this year"", a health minister has said as he urged people to stay in the UK. The ban on foreign holidays was lifted in the latest easing of lockdown restrictions on Monday. People can now go on an overseas break to a limited number of green list destinations without having to quarantine on their return. But Lord Bethell indicated that people should not be going abroad at all this year, stressing that ""travel is dangerous"" due to difficulties over segregation during the journey, including at airports. He made his remarks amid continuing concern over the rise in cases of the highly transmissible Indian coronavirus variant in parts of England. Speaking at Westminster, Lord Bethell told peers: ""Travelling is dangerous. That is not news to us or to the people who get on those planes in the first place. ""We do ask people, particularly as we go into the summer, travelling is not for this year, please stay in this country."" Read more on the rules for foreign travel here. Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst Taiwanâs Central Epidemic Command Center has confirmed a further two people have died from Covid-19, taking the country's total death toll to 14. According to Taiwanâs Central News Agency, one of the deceased was an 86-year-old man ""with multiple chronic diseases"". The other was a woman in her 60s. Both had only tested positive two days earlier. The patients lived in New Taipei and Taipei City, the two areas of Taiwan that are currently experiencing level three Covid-19 restrictions. Taiwan has four Covid-19 response levels, and a level three alert is a ânear lockdownâ, where mask-wearing is enforced and all but essential businesses are closed. The island is currently experiencing its worst outbreak since the beginning of the pandemic. There have been more than 1,000 locally transmitted cases recorded over the last week. Yesterday, Taiwan recorded 333 cases - a record daily high since the pandemic began. The island also announced it was barring entry to non-Taiwanese nationals, and all schools across the island have now closed until 28 May. Last year, Taiwan was deemed something of a success story. At the end of 2020, it had only recorded 799 cases of Covid-19. There have now been more than 2,260 cases in total, and 1,119 of those are active cases. BBC Radio 5 Live Earlier today, 5 Live's Your Call programmed asked listeners whether they agreed with theatre impresario Andrew Lloyd Webber's comments that people who refused the vaccine were selfish. The composercompared vaccine refusers to drunk drivers. Mark, from the South West, said it was an unfair comparison. ""Iâm absolutely in fear of the vaccine...Iâm more in fear of the vaccine than I am of coronavirus,"" he said. ""I donât smoke, I take great care of myself. I make sure that everything I want to take on board into my body...I make sure that itâs good for me. Iâm not perfect but you cannot label me as the same."" Rachel, in Malvern, said she agreed with Lord Lloyd-Webber. ""Youâve only got to have a look at India and whatâs going on in those countries, the amount of people getting really ill, I find it disgraceful that people think they shouldn't have the vaccine,"" she said. ""I accept there are people with health issues that canât, but anybody else who refuses to have it, I honestly feel they should lose their jobs, they shouldnât be allowed to work with the public in any capacity, they should have to stay at home...no benefits should be paid, no wages, no furlough.""

Three other Senedd members were seen drinking during the incident in the Welsh Parliament's tea room last December - then Tory group leader Paul Davies, Labour's Alun Davies and former Conservative member Nick Ramsay. Two investigations into the incident are still going on: one by the Senedd's standards commissioner and one by the local licensing board. At the time of his resignation, Millar said he had been advised that he had not breached coronavirus regulations, although he was ""very sorry"". BBC Radio 5 Live We've been hearing about the sharp rise in cases of the Indian variant of coronavirus cases in Bolton, Blackburn and Bedford in the past few days. Dr Sarah Chan is a Reader in Bioethics at the Usher Institute at the University of Edinburgh and part of the UK Pandemic Ethics Accelerator Programme. Speaking on the sharp rise in areas such as Bolton, Dr Chan told 5 Liveâs Nicky Campbell that we need to understand the reasons people havenât take up the vaccine instead of passing moral judgement on them. ""If youâre finger-pointing and labelling, calling people selfish or irresponsible, we know that kind of language, that kind of tactic is divisive, itâs polarising,"" she said. ""Creating stigma and encouraging us to blame each other is not going to be effective in increasing vaccine uptake...itâs going to damage cooperation, solidarity, cohesion.""

About 150 flights a day are heading to countries the government advises against travelling to Earlier, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said that people should only travel to countries on the amber list in the government's traffic-light system if they have a ""pressing reason"" and not for a holiday. Underthe traffic light system, people can travel to countries on the green list without quarantine, must self-isolate for 10 days after visiting amber list countries, and must stay in government-mandated hotel quarantine if they visit a red list country. Although from yesterday it is no longer illegal, the government still advises people not to travel to countries on the amber list. Reporters had questioned the PM on why there were 150 flights a day heading to amber list countries and whether Environment Secretary George Eustice was wrong to suggest this morning that people could travel to visit friends and family ""if they feel the need"". Labour's shadow home secretary says ministers are ""giving out conflicting and confused adviceâ and repeats the party's call to pause international travel. He says the government's travel policies have âunravelled into dangerous chaos within a matter of hoursâ. Chris JeavansBBC News The variant first discovered in India can be found across England, but there are only a small number of hotspots. The most up-to-date data, covering the week up to Saturday 8 May, shows that most of the local authorities in England that have found a case havenât found many. Theyâre shown by the light blue areas in this map. There are a small number of places that have seen high numbers of the variant: Bolton, Blackburn with Darwen, Sefton and Bedford. Theyâre among the areas with the highest numbers of cases in the UK, fuelling concerns that this version of coronavirus may spread more quickly than the Kent strain that has been dominant since December. But scientists advising the government say itâs too soon to know one way or the other and that theyâll be working hard over the coming weeks to answer that question. Travelling is dangerous and ""not for this year"", a health minister has said as he urged people to stay in the UK. The ban on foreign holidays was lifted in the latest easing of lockdown restrictions on Monday. People can now go on an overseas break to a limited number of green list destinations without having to quarantine on their return. But Lord Bethell indicated that people should not be going abroad at all this year, stressing that ""travel is dangerous"" due to difficulties over segregation during the journey, including at airports. He made his remarks amid continuing concern over the rise in cases of the highly transmissible Indian coronavirus variant in parts of England. Speaking at Westminster, Lord Bethell told peers: ""Travelling is dangerous. That is not news to us or to the people who get on those planes in the first place. ""We do ask people, particularly as we go into the summer, travelling is not for this year, please stay in this country."" Read more on the rules for foreign travel here. Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst Taiwanâs Central Epidemic Command Center has confirmed a further two people have died from Covid-19, taking the country's total death toll to 14. According to Taiwanâs Central News Agency, one of the deceased was an 86-year-old man ""with multiple chronic diseases"". The other was a woman in her 60s. Both had only tested positive two days earlier. The patients lived in New Taipei and Taipei City, the two areas of Taiwan that are currently experiencing level three Covid-19 restrictions. Taiwan has four Covid-19 response levels, and a level three alert is a ânear lockdownâ, where mask-wearing is enforced and all but essential businesses are closed. The island is currently experiencing its worst outbreak since the beginning of the pandemic. There have been more than 1,000 locally transmitted cases recorded over the last week. Yesterday, Taiwan recorded 333 cases - a record daily high since the pandemic began. The island also announced it was barring entry to non-Taiwanese nationals, and all schools across the island have now closed until 28 May. Last year, Taiwan was deemed something of a success story. At the end of 2020, it had only recorded 799 cases of Covid-19. There have now been more than 2,260 cases in total, and 1,119 of those are active cases. BBC Radio 5 Live Earlier today, 5 Live's Your Call programmed asked listeners whether they agreed with theatre impresario Andrew Lloyd Webber's comments that people who refused the vaccine were selfish. The composercompared vaccine refusers to drunk drivers. Mark, from the South West, said it was an unfair comparison. ""Iâm absolutely in fear of the vaccine...Iâm more in fear of the vaccine than I am of coronavirus,"" he said. ""I donât smoke, I take great care of myself. I make sure that everything I want to take on board into my body...I make sure that itâs good for me. Iâm not perfect but you cannot label me as the same."" Rachel, in Malvern, said she agreed with Lord Lloyd-Webber. ""Youâve only got to have a look at India and whatâs going on in those countries, the amount of people getting really ill, I find it disgraceful that people think they shouldn't have the vaccine,"" she said. ""I accept there are people with health issues that canât, but anybody else who refuses to have it, I honestly feel they should lose their jobs, they shouldnât be allowed to work with the public in any capacity, they should have to stay at home...no benefits should be paid, no wages, no furlough.""

"UK job vacancies have hit their highest level since the start of the pandemic as the easing of lockdown measures has led employers to start recruiting. In the February-to-April period there were 657,000 vacancies, up about 48,400 on the previous quarter. The unemployment rate fell slightly to 4.8% in the three months to March, down from 4.9% in February,the Office for National Statistics said,external. The ONS said there were ""early signs of recovery"" in the jobs market, However, despite the rise in job vacancies over the past 12 months, the level remains almost 128,000 below its pre-pandemic level in the January-to-March quarter of 2020. The official figures confirm several reports in recent weeks by recruitment companies that they are seeing a rise in job advertisements, leading to concern among some employers that they could face staff shortages. UK economy set to grow at fastest rate in 70 years Are you currently unemployed? Emailhaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external The ONS said the number of workers on payrolls had risen by 97,000 between March and April, but was still 772,000 lower than before the pandemic struck. Darren Morgan, ONS director of economic statistics, said the number of employees on payroll ""rose strongly in April"" as the economy began to reopen, continuing an improvement from its November trough. But he said: ""There remains, however, three-quarters of a million people fewer on the payroll compared with the pre-pandemic peak. ""With many businesses reopening, the recent recovery in job vacancies continued into April, especially in sectors such as hospitality and entertainment."" Chancellor Rishi Sunak said the latest figures showed the impact of the government's focus on protecting jobs during the pandemic. ""While sadly not every job can be saved, nearly two million fewer people are now expected to be out of work than initially expected - showing our Plan for Jobs is working."" Business leaders welcomed the vacancy levels as positive signs for the economy, but warned there was still a long way to go. As many experts have pointed out, Tuesday's positive jobs news does not disguise that many people in the labour market are still struggling. Interior designer Sheila Smith lost her job working for hospitality venues in October - and despite some 500 applications is still unemployed. She worries that businesses are looking for someone younger and cheaper than her. ""I've been for a few interviews, which I haven't been successful at,"" she told the BBC. She said the most frustrating aspect of the job search was the lack of communication from potential employers. ""When you take time to go for a job interview, get yourself prepared, but then you hear nothing back - that's the most frustrating thing."" Although the number of job vacancies is rising, they are still well down on pre-pandemic levels and Sheila reckons there's about 200 people applying for each post advertised. ""It destroys your confidence,"" she said. ""I've worked solidly for years in the industry, and you find yourself in this situation scrambling for jobs. ""You feel like you're stuck at square one."" Matthew Percival, director of people and skills at the CBI business lobby group, said: ""Businesses are starting to report vacancies they're struggling to fill so government support for skills and retraining is essential."" He added that companies still needed clarity over the rules for the next stage of reopening the economy, which is currently planned for 21 June. Research consultancy Capital Economics said the fall in the jobless rate showed that the jobs furlough scheme was ""insulating the labour market"". The firm added that although it expects the unemployment rate to rise over the next few months, that would most likely be due to people returning to the labour market rather than people losing their jobs. The most encouraging sign here is that vacancies over the three months to April averaged 657,000. The ONS said its experimental monthly vacancy statistics for April itself were ""at near pre-pandemic levels"". There are increasing numbers of employers expressing concern about recruitment difficulties. The jobs data continue to show some signs of resilience and recovery, with unemployment down again to 4.8%, and employment up for the fifth consecutive month. It's so far a slow recovery based on gradual re-openings seen up until last month. The pattern is, though, as uneven as the lifting of the restrictions. Hospitality and retail jobs are still well down on pre-pandemic levels, and this means all of the loss in payrolled jobs and more can currently be explained by what has happened to young workers. There are still over four million workers on the furlough scheme, who count as employed. Are you currently unemployed? Share your experiences by emailinghaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external.

"A quarter of native mammals are at risk of extinction in the UK The government has promised to ""halt the decline of nature"" as part of a new drive to improve the environment. More trees are to be planted, the sale of peat will be banned and new targets will be set to return species such as wildcats and beavers to the countryside. The measures include a legally binding 2030 target to address wildlife loss. Environment Secretary George Eustice described the move as ""a huge step forward"". In a speech from Delamere Forest, in Cheshire, he said: ""We hope that this will be the net zero equivalent for nature, spurring action of the scale required to address the biodiversity crisis."" The RSPB says the UK provides crucial habitat for many birds, including the curlew The legally binding target will apply to England only, with devolved administrations able to set their own policy. Wildlife groups have welcomed the proposals as ""an important milestone"". Richard Benwell, CEO of Wildlife and Countryside Link, a coalition of 57 nature groups, said: ""If the legal detail is right, and the targets are comprehensive and science-based, then this could inspire the investment and action needed to protect and restore wildlife, after a century of decline."" Black Lake peat bog in Delamere Forest has been restored - a project that has taken 20 years The government has also set out new proposals to protect England's peatlands as part of a drive to achieve its goal of bringing greenhouse gas emissions to zero overall - known as net zero - by 2050. It plans to ban sales of peat compost to gardeners in England by 2024 and provide funding to restore 35,000 hectares (86,000 acres) of degraded peatlands in the next four years, about 1% of the UK's total. PM promises to protect 30% of UK's land by 2030 Prosperity comes at 'devastating' cost to nature Letter demands action over 'nature in freefall' Healthy peatlands play an important role in storing carbon - three times as much as forests. However, peatlands damaged by draining, planting with trees, or farming, start to leak carbon, contributing to greenhouse gas emissions. Only a fifth of the UK's 2.6 million hectares (6.4 million acres) of peat are in good condition. Estimates suggest the habitat - which ranges from upland moors to rich agricultural lowland - could give off as much as 23 million tonnes of carbon emissions a year. The Wildlife Trusts' chief executive Craig Bennett said the government's initial target to restore 35,000 hectares of peatland was disappointing and called for a commitment to restore all upland peatland and at least a quarter of lowland peat. He said: ""It's essential that we stop nature's decline and restore 30% of land and sea by 2030 - doing so will help wildlife fight back and enable repaired habitats to store carbon once more."" The Wildlife Trusts said it could be ""embarrassing"" for the UK - as hosts of the key climate summit in Glasgow in November - to allow carbon-rich peat to be ""dug up and sold"". ""Peatland is so important for carbon sequestration and for wildlife. And, currently, we're wrapping it in plastic and selling it in garden centres,"" said Elliot Chapman-Jones. The government also plans to treble tree planting rates in England to 7,000 hectares of new woodland a year by 2024. There will also be funding to provide incentives for landowners and farmers to plant and manage trees, and at least three community forests will be created.  The plan to treble tree-planting rates in England by 2024 sounds like an awful lot, but it is starting from a very low level. We've looked at previous tree planting pledgesmade by the various parties at the last general election. Tree planting is a devolved issue, so there are different policies across the UK. At least three community forests will be created as part of the new England Trees Action Plan, but the government's UK-wide goal is for 30,000 hectares of trees to be planted annually by 2024. That means most of the planting will still be of non-native trees on commercial conifer plantations in Scotland, which deliver fewer benefits for wildlife and biodiversity. The government hopes to increase tree cover from 10% to 12% of total land area in England, and the aim is to increase the UK-wide figure to 17% by 2050 to help the country reach net zero carbon emissions. The average tree cover across the rest of Europe is about 35% of land area. So, the UK target - and England's in particular - is actually quite modest. Groups including the Wildlife Trusts and RSPB have campaigned to halt the ongoing decline in nature Abi Bunker, director of conservation and external affairs at the Woodland Trust, said the UK's woodland cover had nearly tripled since 1900, but much of the increase has been low diversity forestry plantations. ""Native woods and trees are fragmented, at risk from development, and too many are in poor condition, with half of UK wildlife and plant species that depend on woodland in decline,"" she said. ""Government's targets for new woodland should be met by integrating UK sourced and grown native trees into our landscapes, helping to deliver for nature and people.""

"Dr Khan before and after catching Covid, which caused him many symptoms including swollen eyelids A decision about whether key workers with long Covid should get compensation could take more than a year, government advisers have told the BBC. It comes after 65 MPs and peers wrote to Boris Johnson asking for the illness to be made an ""occupational disease"". More thana million people in the UK are thought to have long Covid, including over 120,000 healthcare workers. The government says it is committed to supporting people through the pandemic. Frontline key workers who believe they caught long Covid through their jobs are becoming increasingly worried about what financial support is available to them if they cannot return to work. Dr Asad Khan, a respiratory consultant in Manchester, was treating Covid patients every day using what he calls an ""abysmal"" level of personal protective equipment (PPE) because of ""inadequate"" government guidelines. He caught Covid in November and has now been off work for nearly six months with a number of debilitating symptoms - including extreme fatigue, heart palpitations and an inability to control his bodily functions. Long Covid: Why are some people not recovering? 'My fatigue was like nothing I've ever experienced before' He is currently on full sick pay which he has been told will last a year but, given the severity of his condition, he is already worried what will happen after that. ""Theoretically I could lose my job. I could be retired sick, which is a scary prospect,"" he said. He now wants the government to step in and provide financial support. ""There are tens of thousands of us who are living with the illness, unable to work, unable to function. ""We answered the call to action when we were needed, the decent thing to do now would be to ensure those of us who have acquired Covid as a result of increased exposure to the virus should be assured of some financial compensation."" While NHS staff with long Covid receive full pay for a year in England and Wales - and longer in Scotland and Northern Ireland - many in the private sector only get 28 weeks Statutory Sick Pay. Claire* was working with Covid patients in a care home in the East of England during the first wave and caught the illness last May. She has been unable to work since. When her six months Statutory Sick Pay ran out, she lost her job on capability grounds. A year on since becoming sick, with no prospect of returning to work - and no financial support - she told File on 4 she faces losing her home, and feels ""discarded"" by the government. ""They've paid all this money for people to stay at home on furlough and I can't claim a penny, that is quite an insult. I'm not asking for a lot and I'm hoping it won't be forever, but to just constantly be turned down for any financial help takes its toll."" ""We were 'heroes' for keeping the country going - all the key workers, shop workers and bus drivers - then I get ill, I can't work and they don't want to know, they don't care. I just need some help."" Liberal Democrat MP Layla Moran, who chairs the All Party Parliamentary Group on Coronavirus, said she wants long Covid to be classed as an 'occupational disease' which would allow sufferers to be awarded a benefit according to their degree of disability - called an Industrial Injuries Disablement Benefit (IIDB). ""These are the very people we should be supporting the most - they aren't just the people who went out and did the jobs that needed to be done, they are also the people that got sick from it. ""It is only right the government now looks after their lives if they've been affected by long Covid - that they are compensated and this would be according to their need at the time."" But the body which advises the government whether it should classify an illness as an 'occupational disease' has told File on 4 such a recommendation could take a year. Dr Lesley Rushton, who chairs the Industrial Injuries Advisory Council (IIAC), says they are hampered by a lack of research and data and whilst they realise some occupations are more risky than others, a major issue is proving someone got Covid through their work. ""For some diseases it's very clear cut, you can only get the exposure at a particular workplace, doing a particular type of work"" she said. ""But with coronavirus, it has the same effect whether or not the exposure has arisen at work or outside work."" Once a recommendation has been made to the government, it would then have to go through parliament to be become legislation. Layla Moran believes the government now needs to step in whilst the IIAC gathers evidence. A government spokesperson said: ""This government is committed to supporting people throughout this pandemic and provides a strong financial safety net for those in need. ""Covid-19 is still a relatively new disease and to better understand the long-term effects we are providing over Â£50m for research funding and working with world-leading scientists to better understand the virus so we can ensure we have the best treatments available.""

The ONS said there were ""early signs of recovery"" in the jobs market, However, despite the rise in job vacancies over the past 12 months, the level remains almost 128,000 below its pre-pandemic level in the January-to-March quarter of 2020. The official figures confirm several reports in recent weeks by recruitment companies that they are seeing a rise in job advertisements, leading to concern among some employers that they could face staff shortages. UK economy set to grow at fastest rate in 70 years Are you currently unemployed? Emailhaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external The ONS said the number of workers on payrolls had risen by 97,000 between March and April, but was still 772,000 lower than before the pandemic struck. Darren Morgan, ONS director of economic statistics, said the number of employees on payroll ""rose strongly in April"" as the economy began to reopen, continuing an improvement from its November trough. But he said: ""There remains, however, three-quarters of a million people fewer on the payroll compared with the pre-pandemic peak. ""With many businesses reopening, the recent recovery in job vacancies continued into April, especially in sectors such as hospitality and entertainment."" Chancellor Rishi Sunak said the latest figures showed the impact of the government's focus on protecting jobs during the pandemic. ""While sadly not every job can be saved, nearly two million fewer people are now expected to be out of work than initially expected - showing our Plan for Jobs is working."" Business leaders welcomed the vacancy levels as positive signs for the economy, but warned there was still a long way to go. As many experts have pointed out, Tuesday's positive jobs news does not disguise that many people in the labour market are still struggling. Interior designer Sheila Smith lost her job working for hospitality venues in October - and despite some 500 applications is still unemployed. She worries that businesses are looking for someone younger and cheaper than her. ""I've been for a few interviews, which I haven't been successful at,"" she told the BBC. She said the most frustrating aspect of the job search was the lack of communication from potential employers. ""When you take time to go for a job interview, get yourself prepared, but then you hear nothing back - that's the most frustrating thing."" Although the number of job vacancies is rising, they are still well down on pre-pandemic levels and Sheila reckons there's about 200 people applying for each post advertised. ""It destroys your confidence,"" she said. ""I've worked solidly for years in the industry, and you find yourself in this situation scrambling for jobs. ""You feel like you're stuck at square one."" Matthew Percival, director of people and skills at the CBI business lobby group, said: ""Businesses are starting to report vacancies they're struggling to fill so government support for skills and retraining is essential."" He added that companies still needed clarity over the rules for the next stage of reopening the economy, which is currently planned for 21 June. Research consultancy Capital Economics said the fall in the jobless rate showed that the jobs furlough scheme was ""insulating the labour market"". The firm added that although it expects the unemployment rate to rise over the next few months, that would most likely be due to people returning to the labour market rather than people losing their jobs. The most encouraging sign here is that vacancies over the three months to April averaged 657,000. The ONS said its experimental monthly vacancy statistics for April itself were ""at near pre-pandemic levels"". There are increasing numbers of employers expressing concern about recruitment difficulties. The jobs data continue to show some signs of resilience and recovery, with unemployment down again to 4.8%, and employment up for the fifth consecutive month. It's so far a slow recovery based on gradual re-openings seen up until last month. The pattern is, though, as uneven as the lifting of the restrictions. Hospitality and retail jobs are still well down on pre-pandemic levels, and this means all of the loss in payrolled jobs and more can currently be explained by what has happened to young workers. There are still over four million workers on the furlough scheme, who count as employed. Are you currently unemployed? Share your experiences by emailinghaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external.

"This video can not be played Holidaying Brits touch down in Portugal: 'It feels unreal' Thousands of British holidaymakers have begun taking advantage of the easing of lockdown rules on overseas travel. Travellers from England, Scotland and Wales are jetting off to some countries in what the crisis-hit tourism industry hopes is the start of a recovery. Travellers can now visit 12 countries on the government's green list, including Portugal and Israel, without isolating on their return. The bosses of British Airways and Ryanair said confidence was returning. The vast majority of tourist destinations remain on the amber and red lists, meaning travellers must quarantine when they get back. Bookings also remain well down on pre-pandemic levels. However, BA chief executive Sean Doyle told the BBC that the airline's six flights due to depart from Heathrow on Monday to ""green"" destinations such as Lisbon, Faro and Madeira were ""very busy"". He said the latest relaxation of restrictions was ""a small step in the right direction"". Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary said there weredefinite signs of an early reboundin travel to European destinations. Bookings are up from 500,000 a week in early April to 1.5 million a week now. ""The rate of bookings suggests there is a huge amount of confidence,"" he told BBC Breakfast. ""We are very optimistic for the next couple of months."" Nellie and Jill are off to Portugal on Monday - but it seemed touch and go right up to the moment they got to the airport. They are ""super excited and really happy to be able to travel again"". But the past few weeks have been stressful, especially as it was only confirmed on Friday that they could definitely travel. Nellie said it was then a real scramble to get PCR coronavirus tests over the weekend, which Jill added was quite complicated. ""Adding all the documentation wasn't easy but we persevered and we're glad we did,"" Jill said. Some holiday sun and a glass of wine on their balcony would make it all worth it, she added. Gatwick Airport chief executive Stewart Wingate said welcoming holidaymakers for the first time in months was a ""big relief"". He expected the number of travellers to increase significantly by the end of May - but this will still be less than 15% of the traffic seen in pre-pandemic times. ""It's an important day for us... we're looking forward to seeing more countries added to the green list in the weeks ahead,"" he added. But there is still caution. Online travel agent Thomas Cook said the number of people booking to travel abroad was ""still small"". It said 75% of its bookings were for Portugal, although Thomas Cook customers planning to jet off this week numbered only in their hundreds. Live: Indoor pints and trips abroad as lockdown eases What are my refund rights for foreign holidays? The rules for holidays in green list countries such as Portugal Public must play their part as lockdown eases - PM People in Wales asked not to travel abroad On Friday, Portugal announced that travellers from the UK would be allowed to enter its borders provided they could show a negative PCR test result from the previous 72 hours. That led to an increase in demand for flights to the country. Tui, which has 19 flights scheduled from the UK to Portugal next week, said eight of those would now be on a Boeing Dreamliner, which can carry up to 345 people - almost twice as many people as the Boeing 737s that it had planned to use. Passengers checking in at Gatwick Many of those who do intend to get away plan to do so in style. Thomas Cook reported that 85% of customers had booked four or five-star hotels. Before the crisis, only around half of people chose to splash out on that kind of luxury. Hays Travel has noticed a similar trend. At present around half of its customers are booking for next year but it highlighted a ""cautious optimism"" among travellers following an almost four-fold increase in bookings for Portugal this summer. Chief operating officer Jonathon Woodall said the average spend on a two-week holiday for a family of four had increased by Â£370 to Â£4,000 as people look to ""fulfil their bucket list"". ""People are upgrading to better destinations and accommodation, spending more to treat themselves,"" he said.

Passengers on board have said they feel a little like guinea pigs. The travel industry knows it's important to make this process smooth and safe if it's to have a good summer. While travel from England, Scotland and Wales is permitted to the 12 countries on the green list, most of the destinations are either remote islands or do not currently allow UK tourists to enter. And the government is advising people not to make non-essential trips to locations on its amber list, which covers popular destinations such as Spain, France, Italy and Greece. However, the guidance is expected to be ignored by some holidaymakers. EasyJet and Tui have both said that they will operate holidays to countries classified as amber, provided Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) does not advise against ""all but essential"" travel. The majority of countries around the world are in the amber category, meaning that arrivals from these places to the UK are required to quarantine at home for 10 days as well as taking a Covid test before departure and two more on arrival. Travellers arriving back in England from an amber country have the option after five days of quarantine to pay for a private Covid test under theTest to Release scheme,external. If the result is negative, the quarantine can end. Masked sunbathers in Portugal BA boss Sean Doyle said ""cautious optimism"" should be exercised when decisions are made about whether to expand the green list when it is reviewed on 7 June. He said vaccination and infection rates in a number of the major aviation markets were ""trending positively"", noting that the US - an important market for both tourism and business ""now has 60% of its adult population vaccinated [and] infections are falling"". From Monday, people travelling abroad will be able to use the NHS app - which is different to the NHS Covid-19 app - to prove they have had the vaccine. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps previously said people who have had both doses will be able to use the app at border controls, although the government says people should still check countries' entry requirements as tests or quarantine might still be needed.

"The International Energy Agency (IEA) says that no new fossil fuel boilers should be sold from 2025 if the world is to achieve net-zero emissions by the middle of this century. It's one of 400 steps on the road to net-zero proposed by the agency in aspecial report,external. The sale of new petrol and diesel cars around the world would end by 2035. The IEA says that from now, there is no place for new coal, oil or gas exploration or supplies. What can I use instead of a gas boiler and what will it cost? Banish coal, urges UK head of UN climate summit Cutting methane gas 'crucial for climate fight' Do you have a question about green boilers? Emailyourquestions@bbc.co.uk,external The report has been welcomed as an important contribution on the road toCOP26 in Glasgow, when countries will attempt to agree the measures needed to put the Paris climate agreement into practice. In that context, tackling the issue of how the world produces and consumes energy is the most critical endeavour. The energy sector, according to the IEA, is the source of around 75% of the emissions of greenhouse gases that are driving up global temperatures. Models designed so they could switch to burn hydrogen could be an option - and will probably be around Â£100 more than the Â£2,000 standard gas boiler. This will help the climate because hydrogen from renewables burns with no emissions. But climate advisors say it will probably only heat around 11% of homes, because hydrogen supply will be limited. So most are expected to be warmed by heat pumps, which extract warmth from the air or the ground, or from water - a bit like a fridge operating in reverse which sell for between Â£6,000 and Â£18,000. They're subsidised, but MPs say the government needs to offer more help to home owners. What's more, heat pumps need high levels of insulation which aren't always possible. There are other technologies being considered. Geothermal heat may warm places such as Cornwall. Nuclear might figure, too. But the great task of shifting heating from gas will be expensive and difficult. How will we heat homes in zero carbon Britain? To keep the world safe, scientists say that global heating has to be limited to 1.5C by the end of this century. To keep close to that mark, emissions of warming gases need to drop by half by 2030, and essentially hit zero in 2050. The IEA's new study sets out what it believes to be a realistic road map to achieve that aim, while at the same time creating millions of jobs and boosting economic growth. Electric vehicle charge points will have to increase to around 40 million worldwide over the next decade By 2050 it envisions a global economy that is twice as big as today, with two billion extra people but with the demand for energy dropping by 8%. The authors say their plan achieves this with no carbon offsets and a low reliance on technologies to remove carbon from the air. Crucially, it sees no place for new supplies of coal, oil or gas. Fossil fuel use falls drastically in the netâzero emissions scenario by 2050, and no new oil and natural gas fields are required beyond those that have already been approved for development. No new coal mines or mine extensions are required. Emissions from electricity generation fall to netâzero in advanced economies by 2035 and globally by 2040. Renewables drive the transformation, up from 29% of generation in 2020 to nearly 90% in 2050. The number of public charging points for electric cars rises from around one million today to 40 million by 2030, requiring an annual investment of $90bn by the end of the decade. By 2035, nearly all cars sold globally are electric, and by 2050 nearly all heavy trucks sold are fuel cell or electric. Per capita income from oil and gas in countries that rely on fossil fuel production falls by around 75% from $1,800 to $450 by the 2030s. However, the IEA's route to net-zero will require massive investments and international co-operation on an unprecedented scale. It will also have direct impacts on consumers all over the world. Home heating with gas or oil is currently a major source of carbon emissions in many countries, responsible for around 20% of CO2 in the US and the UK. The IEA path to net-zero says that in just four years' time, there should be no new fossil fuel boilers sold, except where they are compatible with hydrogen. This will not be an easy shift for the building sector. ""It will be very difficult, because it means a massive turn in the consumption behaviour,"" said Maria Pastukhova, from the E3G environmental think tank. ""The building sector is maybe one of the toughest ones because aside from the emphasis that the IEA has put on efficient buildings, all the old existing infrastructure has to be retrofitted. And that's a particular challenge for governments."" The IEA says that as well as greening the energy system it will need to be expanded to provide electricity to the 785 million people in the world who have no access at present. A worker cleaning solar panels at a solar park - the IEA says a massive expansion is needed To meet this challenge the world will need to install four times the amount of wind and solar energy than it did in 2020. This equates to adding a massive solar park every day over the next nine years. By 2035 the report says there would be no more sales of new cars with petrol or diesel engines. All of the world's electricity would be emissions free by 2040. While the scale of the change is unprecedented, the IEA believes it will create around 14 million jobs by 2030, while investments in energy production soar to $5tn, boosting global GDP. ""The scale and speed of the efforts demanded by this critical and formidable goal - our best chance of tackling climate change and limiting global warming to 1.5C - make this perhaps the greatest challenge humankind has ever faced,"" said Fatih Birol, the IEA Executive Director. ""The IEA's pathway to this brighter future brings a historic surge in clean energy investment that creates millions of new jobs and lifts global economic growth. Moving the world on to that pathway requires strong and credible policy actions from governments, underpinned by much greater international co-operation."" One issue that has caused concern among environmentalists is the reliance in the report on unproven technologies, such as carbon capture, utilisation and storage (CCUS). There are also worries about bioenergy which involves the use of trees, crops and plants to make liquid fuel or to generate electricity. The IEA path to net-zero sees a significant increase of around 60% in this energy source, with an estimate that energy crops and forestry plantations will take up 25% more land than is used today for bioenergy production. Palm oil has been a major source of bioenergy, used to make diesel ""Burning forests for energy is the latest in a parade of false climate solutions,"" said Hannah Mowat from Fern, a Brussels-based NGO campaigning to protect forests and people. ""Sadly, the IEA has bought into it by proposing wholly unrealistic levels of bioenergy, which will damage forests the world over and worsen climate change. Instead of burning trees for energy, we should focus on cutting fossil fuel use, maximising energy efficiency and increasing renewables such as solar, wind, heat pumps and geothermal.""

"Images of Gaza on Google Earth are of poor resolution Why is Gaza, one of the most densely populated places in the world, blurry on Google Maps? It's an issue that has been highlighted by researchers using open-source, publicly available information - including mapping data - to locate attacks and document the destruction. In fact, much of both Israel and the Palestinian territories appear on Google Earth as low-resolution satellite imagery, even though higher-quality images are available from satellite companies. It's barely possible to see the cars in Gaza City. Compare that with Pyongyang, the secretive capital of North Korea, where the cars are sharply defined and it's possible to make out individual people. Google Earth image of Gaza on the left, and on the right the most recently available image of Pyongyang, North Korea. It has become a vital element in the reporting of conflict, but there are also concerns the availability of detailed images can compromise security. In the latest Middle East confrontation, investigators are looking to corroborate the locations of missile fire and targeted buildings in Gaza and Israel, using satellites. ""The fact that we don't get high-resolution satellite images from Israel and Palestinian territories sets us back,"" says Samir, an open-source investigator. However, on Google Earth, the most widely used image platform, the most recent imagery for Gaza is of low resolution and therefore blurry. ""The most recent Google Earth image is from 2016 and looks like trash. I zoomed in on some random rural area of Syria and it has had 20+ images taken since that time, in very high resolution,""tweeted,externalAric Toler, a journalist for Bellingcat. Google says its aim is to ""keep densely populated places refreshed on a regular basis,external"" but this hasn't been the case with Gaza. Until last year, the US government restricted the quality of satellite images that American companies were permitted to provide on a commercial basis. The Kyl-Bingaman Amendment (KBA) had been introduced in 1997 to address Israeli security concerns. Although the ruling only referred to Israel, it was also applied the restriction to images of the Palestinian territories. The KBA limited image quality so that an object the size of a car was just about visible as a highly blurred image, but anything smaller would be very difficult to identify. ""We [Israel] would always prefer to be photographed at the lowest resolution possible"", said Amnon Harari, head of space programmes at Israel's Defence Ministry last year,reported by Reuters,external. ""It's always preferable to be seen blurred, rather than precisely."" It's not uncommon that sites such as military bases have been blurred - but the KBA was the only case of such a wide area being subject to such a restriction. However, once non-US providers, such as French company Airbus, were able to supply these images at a higher resolution, the US came under increasing pressure to end its restrictions. In July 2020, the KBA was dropped, and now the US government allows American companies to provide far higher-quality images of the region (so that objects the size of a person can be readily picked out). ""The initial motivation was scientific,"" says Michael Fradley, an archaeologist at the University of Oxford and one of the academics who successfully campaigned for the amendment to be changed. ""We needed access to high resolution over the Occupied Palestinian Territories comparable to what we use over other parts of the region."" The BBC spoke to Google and Apple (whose mapping apps also show satellite images). Apple said it was working to update its maps soon to a higher resolution. Google told us that its images come from a range of providers and it considers ""opportunities to refresh [its] satellite imagery as higher-resolution imagery becomes available"". But it added that it had ""no plans to share at this time"". Left: The current Google Earth image of Hanadi tower in Gaza; right: a high-resolution satellite image showing the tower destroyed ""Considering the importance of current events, I see no reason why commercial imagery of this area should continue to be deliberately degraded,"" said Nick Waters, an open-source investigator for Bellingcat onTwitter,external. Public mapping platforms, such as Google Earth and Apple Maps, rely on companies that own satellites to supply imagery. Maxar and Planet Labs, two of the largest, are now making available high-resolution images of Israel and Gaza. These much higher quality pictures can reveal detail down to half a metre or less. ""As a result of recent changes to US regulations, the imagery of Israel and Gaza is being provided at 40cm resolution,"" Maxar said in a statement. Planet Labs confirmed to the BBC it supplies imagery at 50cm resolution. Open-source investigators, however, rely heavily on the free-to-use mapping software and don't often have direct access to these high-resolution images. Satellite imagery is used for many purposes, including tracking deforestation and forest fires, as well as investigating human rights abuses around the world. Researchers at Human Rights Watch teamed up with satellite providers Planet Labs in 2017 to showthe destruction of Rohingya villages by the military in Myanmar.,external Satellite imagery from Myanmar revealed the destruction of Rohingya villages The imagery enabled them to map the extent of damage to more than 200 villages in the area, by comparing 40cm-resolution satellite imagery of these areas from before and after. The evidence appeared to corroborate claims from Rohingya, who had fled Myanmar to neighbouring Bangladesh, that their homes had been targeted by the military. Satellite imagery has also been vital in tracking what's been happening in the Xinjiang region of China, including the network of ""re-education"" centres set up there for the Uyghurs. China's hidden camps A 2019 satellite image of a re-education camp in the Hotan area of Xinjiang, China The information has helped to show where these facilities have been built, and high-resolution images have also given an idea of their size and particular features.

"The Palestinian militant group Hamas launched an unprecedented assault on Israel on 7 October, with hundreds of gunmen infiltrating communities near the Gaza Strip. About 1,200 people were killed, and more than 250 were taken to Gaza as hostages, according to Israeli tallies. More than 33,000 Palestinians in Gaza have been killed in air and artillery strikes carried out by the Israeli military in response, Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry says. Why there is a war:What is Hamas and why is it fighting Israel? Gaza Strip mapped:Life in Gaza under siege Explained:The faces of hostages taken from Israel Britain took control of the area known as Palestine following the defeat of the Ottoman Empire, which ruled that part of the Middle East, in World War One. The land was inhabited by a Jewish minority and Arab majority, as well as other, smaller ethnic groups. Tensions between the two peoples grew when the international community gave the UK the task of establishing a ""national home"" in Palestine for Jewish people. This stemmed from the Balfour Declaration of 1917, a pledge made by then Foreign Secretary Arthur Balfour to Britain's Jewish community. The declaration was enshrined in the British mandate over Palestine and endorsed by the newly-created League of Nations - forerunner of the United Nations - in 1922. To Jews Palestine was their ancestral home, but Palestinian Arabs also claimed the land and opposed the move. A Haganah (Jewish Underground) fighter just before the start of the Israeli War of Independence 1948 Between the 1920s and 1940s, the number of Jews arriving there grew, with many fleeing from persecution in Europe, especially the Nazi Holocaust in World War Two. Violence between Jews and Arabs, and against British rule, also increased. In 1947, the UN voted for Palestine to be split into separate Jewish and Arab states, with Jerusalem becoming an international city. That plan was accepted by Jewish leaders but rejected by the Arab side and never implemented. The soldiers of allied Arab Legion forces fire on fighters of the Haganah, the Jewish Agency self-defence force, in March 1948 In 1948, unable to solve the problem, Britain withdrew and Jewish leaders declared the creation of the State of Israel. It was intended to be a safe haven for Jews fleeing persecution, as well as a national homeland for Jews. Fighting between Jewish and Arab militias had been intensifying for months, and the day after Israel declared statehood, five Arab countries attacked. Hundreds of thousands of Palestinians fled or were forced out of their homes in what they call Al Nakba, orthe ""Catastrophe"" By the time the fighting ended in a ceasefire the following year, Israel controlled most of the territory.  9.8 millionPopulation 73.6%Jews 21.1%Arabs 5.3%Other Jordan occupied land which became known as the West Bank, and Egypt occupied Gaza. Jerusalem was divided between Israeli forces in the West, and Jordanian forces in the East. Because there was never a peace agreement there were more wars and fighting in the following decades. Israel's borders explained in maps In a war in 1967, Israel occupied East Jerusalem and the West Bank, as well as most of the Syrian Golan Heights, Gaza and the Egyptian Sinai peninsula. Most Palestinian refugees and their descendants live in Gaza and the West Bank, as well as in neighbouring Jordan, Syria and Lebanon. Neither they nor their descendants have been allowed by Israel to return to their homes - Israel says this would overwhelm the country and threaten its existence as a Jewish state. Israeli military commanders arrive in East Jerusalem during the Six Day War in 1967 Israel still occupies the West Bank and claims the whole of Jerusalem as its capital, while the Palestinians claim East Jerusalem as the capital of a hoped-for future Palestinian state. The US is one of only a handful of countries to recognise the city as Israel's capital. In the past 50 years Israel has built settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem, where more than 700,000 Jews now live. Settlements are held to be illegal under international law - that is the position of the UN Security Council and the UK government, among others - although Israel rejects this. Gaza is a narrow strip of land sandwiched between Israel and the Mediterranean Sea, but with a short southern border with Egypt. Just 41km (25 miles) long and 10km wide, it has more than two million inhabitants and is one of the most densely populated places on Earth. In the wake of the 1948-49 war, Gaza was occupied by Egypt for 19 years. Israel occupied Gaza in the 1967 war and stayed until 2005, during that time building Jewish settlements. Israel withdrew its troops and settlers in 2005, though it retained control over its airspace, shared border and shoreline. The UN still considers the territory to be occupied by Israel. Gaza Strip in maps: What it's like for the people who live there There are a number of issues which the two sides cannot agree on. These include: What should happen to Palestinian refugees Whether Jewish settlements in the occupied West Bank should stay or be removed Whether the two sides should share Jerusalem And - perhaps most tricky of all - whether a Palestinian state should be created alongside Israel Israel-Palestinian peace talks were held on and off between the 1990s and 2010s, interspersed with outbreaks of violence. A negotiated peace did seem possible in the early days. A series of secret talks in Norway became the Oslo peace process, forever symbolised by a ceremony on the White House lawn in 1993 presided over by President Bill Clinton. In a historic moment, the Palestinians recognised the State of Israel and Israel recognised its historical enemy, the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO), as the sole representative of the Palestinian people. A self-governing Palestinian Authority was set up. Cracks soon appeared, though, with then opposition leader Benjamin Netanyahu calling Oslo a mortal threat to Israel. The Israelis accelerated their project to settle Jews in the occupied Palestinian territories. The recently emerged Palestinian militant group Hamas sent suicide bombers to kill people in Israel and wreck the chances of a deal. Peace seemed possible in the early 1990s when the Oslo accords were signed The atmosphere in Israel turned ugly, culminating in Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin's assassination by a Jewish extremist on 4 November 1995. In the 2000s attempts were made to revive the peace process - including in 2003 when a roadmap was devised by world powers with the ultimate goal of a two-state solution, but this was never implemented. Peace efforts finally stalled in 2014, when talks failed between the Israelis and Palestinians in Washington. The mostrecent peace plan - prepared by the USwhen Donald Trump was president - was called ""the deal of the century"" by Prime Minister Netanyahu, but was dismissed by the Palestinians as one-sided and never got off the ground. Gaza is ruled by Hamas, an Islamist group which is committed to the destruction of Israel and is designated as a terrorist group by the UK and many other countries. Hamas won the Palestinians' last elections in 2006, and seized control of Gaza the following year by ousting the rival Fatah movement of West Bank-based President Mahmoud Abbas. Since then, militants in Gaza have fought several wars with Israel, which along with Egypt has maintained a partial blockade on the strip to isolate Hamas and try to stop attacks, particularly the indiscriminate firing of rockets towards Israeli cities. Palestinians in Gaza say Israel's restrictions and its air strikes on heavily populated areas amount to collective punishment. This year has been the deadliest on record for Palestinians in the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem, the UN says. Palestinians also complain of the restrictions and military actions being carried out there in response to deadly attacks on Israelis. These tensions could have been one of the reasons for Hamas's latest attack. But the militants may also have been seeking to boost their popularity among ordinary Palestinians, including by using hostages to pressure Israel to free some of the estimated 4,500 Palestinians held in its prisons. The US, the European Union and other Western countries have all condemned the Hamas attack on Israel. The US, Israel's closest ally, has over the years given the Jewish state more than $260bn in military and economic aid, and has promised additional equipment, air defence missiles, guided bombs and ammunition. Where does Israel get its weapons? It also sent two aircraft carrier strike groups to the eastern Mediterranean to deter Israel's enemies, particularly Lebanon's Hezbollah movement, from opening a second front in the war. The US has however criticised Israel over the scale of the Palestinian death toll and sharp differences have emerged between the two allies over the war. Russia and China have both refused to condemn Hamas, and say they are maintaining contact with both sides in the conflict. Russian President Vladimir Putin has blamed US policy for the absence of peace in the Middle East. Iran, Israel's arch-enemy, is a key supporter of Hamas, as well as Hezbollah, whose militants have been exchanging fire with Israeli forces almost daily since Hamas's attack. Questions have been asked about Iran's role in the Hamas' attack, after reports said it gave the go-ahead days before. Tehran has, however,denied any involvement.
