" Robert J Klink spent his life near water. When he was growing up in the 1950s, his parents had a cabin on South Long Lake, in Minnesota, the land of 10,000 lakes. He learned to fish and hunt near the water’s edge. It became a lifelong passion, and for many years he and his second wife Judi Olmsted kept a couple of cabin cruisers on the Saint Croix River. Bob would fish and shoot ducks, which he prepared and ate by himself. Shortly before Bob’s death in March from colon and liver cancer, Olmsted approached her local funeral home, Bradshaw Celebration of Life Center in Stillwater. She told the people there that her husband wanted to be cremated when his time came. She was surprised to learn that Bradshaw’s offered two types of cremation: the one that everyone knows about, involving fire, and a new kind, which uses water. A pamphlet explained that this “gentle, eco-friendly alternative to flame-based cremation” used an alkaline solution made with potassium hydroxide to reduce the body to a skeleton. “At first, I was thinking, ‘Well, I don’t know about that,’” Olmsted says. But the more I thought about it, the more I thought that it was the best way to go.” When we are buried, we ask our planet for resources a final time - wood for a coffin, cotton for the lining, stone for a monument. In the US, graves are usually either lined with concrete or the coffin is placed in a metal or concrete vault which will not decompose. But cremation has an environmental cost too. To burn a single body, a cremator machine generates enough heat to warm a home in winter for a week, even in freezing Minnesota. Bradshaw’s are one of just 14 funeral homes in the world to offer this “green” option. Alkaline hydrolysis is said to be much more environmentally friendly than conventional cremation. They offer both services at the same price and say the new kind of cremation has proved an unexpected hit. Of their customers who choose not to be buried - about half of the total - 80% opt for alkaline hydrolysis. But environmental benefits may not be the only factors influencing their decision. In choosing green cremation Judi Olmsted was mindful of Bob's lifelong love of water and she perceived, in the water-based method, an echo of childhood baptism, which she found touching. Robert’s memorial is held on the outskirts of St Paul, Minnesota, in St Andrew’s, the light-filled Lutheran church the couple attended for years. The urn containing his powdered bones sits on a table next to flowers, photos and a wooden duck. The service opens with Amazing Grace and closes with How Great Thou Art. Afterwards, I ask one of Bradshaw’s funeral directors, Anne Christ, what reasons other people give for choosing alkaline hydrolysis. “There are some folks that we deal with that are very scientifically-minded and of course, interested in that environmental piece,” she says. “But really it’s more about their emotions at that point. I would say most of the people make that decision on a gut feeling about water being gentle.” Is dissolving a body in chemicals really gentler than burning it? Do people think about what goes on in alkaline hydrolysis? “There’s a certain amount they don’t want to know,” she chuckles.

Bradshaw Celebration of Life Center is a long bungalow, surrounded by meadows and groves of slender trees. Described as “prairie-style”, the building was designed by a former student of Frank Lloyd Wright. The alkaline hydrolysis machine is located in the basement. It was installed five years ago at a cost - together with the viewing rooms - of about $750,000 (£580,000). “We could have done it for less,” says Jason Bradshaw, who manages the centre. Jason Bradshaw “We just felt being that we were the first in this area - and one of the first in the country - we needed to put in that larger investment. “Because we have tour groups that come through all the time, we have hospices, we have church groups. We have people who just want to see it, because it’s so new.” He leads me down to the basement and into a circular room with a tinkling waterfall. The ochre-coloured wall contains a floor-to-ceiling window looking on to another room, with wooden sliding doors on the other side of the glass. Jason disappears, switches on the lights in the next room, and pulls open the doors. And there is the alkaline hydrolysis machine - a rectangular steel box, 6ft high, 4ft wide, and 10ft deep. It has a huge circular door covering almost its entire width, that wouldn’t look out of place on a bank vault or submarine. (In fact, the same doors are used on submarines, although the manufacturer points out a crucial difference - submarine hatches are designed to open from the inside too.) The industrial appearance of the machine jars with the sombre intensity of the viewing room. I wonder what sort of person would choose to watch their relative or friend being placed into this machine, which is known as a “tissue digester”. I watch Jason and his colleague, David Haroldsen, wheel a corpse through the door. The body is not identified to me and is completely covered by a black woollen cloth, which Jason and David, wearing blue surgical gloves, delicately tuck into the edges of a steel tray. Then they open the big door, raise the tray to the level of the black cavity inside the machine, and slide it in. On the side of the machine is a computer screen with four buttons labelled “unlock”, “test”, “cycle” and “lock”. Jason closes the door, presses the “lock” button, and with a pneumatic hiss and a whirr, the door locks shut. Then he presses the “cycle” button. The machine beeps twice, there is another hiss and it begins to fill with water. Jason, who has a degree in Biology and Chemistry, explains that the machine weighs each body and calculates how much water and potassium hydroxide to add. He says it’s roughly 65lb per 600lb of water. The powerfully alkaline solution, with a pH of about 14, is heated to 152C (306F), but because the digester is pressurised it does not boil. Alkaline hydrolysis is the natural process your body goes through if you’re buried. Here we’ve created ideal conditions for it to happen much, much faster.” In a cemetery this may take decades, depending on the conditions and the method of burial. In the alkaline hydrolysis machine it takes 90 minutes, though the ensuing rinse cycle takes at least as long again. After three to four hours, the door unlocks and the funeral director sees wet bones scattered across the metal tray, together with any medical implants the dead person had in their body. Metal hip and knee joints come out in perfect condition. The manufacturers of the tissue digester have even proposed that, when more machines are in service, they could be collected and donated to the developing world. By the end, all tissue has dissolved into the solution, which has drained into a separate tank, hidden from view. “It resembles either a tea or an ale,” says Jason. “You can actually see through it - and is really made up of salts and sugars. It has a bit of a soapy smell, which is not off-putting, but it is distinct.” The room in which the machine stands has a smell similar to a dry cleaner’s. The pH level of the effluent is tested, and if necessary adjusted. Then the liquid is released down the drain. It is a sterile mix of amino acids and peptides, with no human DNA. Nevertheless, this disposal of dissolved tissue as a waste by-product, and its progress through the water treatment system, is the part of alkaline hydrolysis that troubles people the most. Bradshaw’s dry the bones - either slowly, in a special cabinet - or quickly, in a tray placed inside a domestic tumble drier. “It works the best,” says David, with a shrug. Then they are put through a machine called a cremulator, which pulverises them into a coarse powder. This is exactly the same machine that is used after a regular cremation, and as with a regular cremation, the word “ashes” is a misnomer. The difference is that the resulting powder is finer and whiter, closely resembling flour - and there is about 30% more of it. So far, the Bradshaw’s tissue digester has processed about 1,100 bodies, roughly one every day. It was manufactured in the UK by a company called Resomation Ltd, which plans to install an identical machine in Sandwell, near Birmingham in the British midlands, at the end of this year. Sometimes families want to help operate the tissue digester, Jason says. We do have families that want to assist in placing the tray in - or to push the ‘cycle’ button to start the process itself. “And some people would look at that and say, ‘Why would you ever want to be involved with that?’ Other people would say: ‘That was the last thing I could do for my mum or my dad.’ “I’ve been here when we’ve had three siblings, all standing next to the machine, and together they have all pressed the button to start it. “And I kind of think of it like, if we’re standing at that cemetery and everybody’s going to take that first scoop of earth and place it into the grave - it’s sort of that moment of letting go.” Around the world, 150,000 people die every day, and the number is rising as the world’s population increases. Today there are 7.5 billion of us on Earth, but by the end of the century it’s thought there will be more than 11 billion. In some countries, space for graves is running out. In the UK, it is estimated that half of cemeteries will be full in the next 20 years. In parts of London, the council no longer offers a burial service, and the city has started re-using grave space, lowering bodies further into the ground and placing new ones on top. The use of land for burial - and the constant upkeep of that land - has an environmental impact. Burial also typically calls for natural resources. Campaigners say that in the US vaults for coffins use up more than 1.6m tons of concrete and 14,000 tons of steel every year. As for cremation, it has been estimated that a typical cremation has a footprint equivalent to about 320kg of carbon dioxide. Unless special measures are taken, dangerous toxins are released too, in particular mercury from dental fillings. This mercury returns to earth in rain and accumulates in the aquatic food chain. How does alkaline hydrolysis compare, from an environmental point of view? According to Dutch researcher Elisabeth Keijzer, who has carried out two studies for the Netherlands Organisation for Applied Research (work commissioned by a funeral chain, Yarden), it’s much better. Her two reports published in 2011 and 2014 make for fascinating if macabre reading. She breaks down burial, cremation and alkaline hydrolysis into dozens of steps, which she assesses against 18 environmental impact yardsticks - such as ozone depletion, marine eco-toxicity and climate change. In 17 of these categories alkaline hydrolysis comes out best. Cremation is worst in the most categories (10), but burial is deemed to have the highest overall environmental impact. Alkaline hydrolysis is found to result in the emission of seven times less CO2 than cremation. To summarise the results, Keijzer and her fellow researchers calculated a “shadow price” for each method - the lowest amount of money it would theoretically cost to either compensate for the environmental impact, or avert it. For burial, the net cost was 63.66 euros per body. For cremation, it was 48.47 euros. For alkaline hydrolysis, just 2.59 euros. While Keijzer’s work gives a more resounding endorsement of alkaline hydrolysis’s eco-credentials than some previous studies, it makes assumptions about burial and cremation that do not hold for every country in the world. There is little mention of the mercury pollution caused by cremation, because in the Netherlands this is routinely captured using expensive filtering equipment - yet this does not happen in North America. On the other hand, the report assumes that a cremation involves burning a body in a coffin, which is routine in the Netherlands and the UK, but not in the US. In some states - including Minnesota - a casket is rented to display a body before it is sent for cremation, which is standard practice with alkaline hydrolysis. This is significant because a full 28.89 euros of cremation's shadow price is the environmental cost of the coffin (and surprisingly, of that 21 euros is just the cotton lining). Keijzer doesn’t measure the environmental impact of natural burial, where a body is wrapped in a cloth and buried without a headstone.

Keijzer doesn’t measure the environmental impact of natural burial, where a body is wrapped in a cloth and buried without a headstone. There are other caveats too. When you look at a person’s carbon footprint over their lifetime, the disposal of the body accounts for only a tiny fraction - between 10 and 30 thousandths, according to Keijzer. She has also calculated that the funeral ceremony itself - all the mourners travelling to the service, all the cut flowers and so on - has an impact on the environment roughly three times greater than the impact of the burial or cremation. But that said, Keijzer's work does suggest that “green cremation” may really be greener than the most common alternatives. In 2001, British news broadcasts were filled with disturbing footage of cows being led to slaughter, piled up and burned. It was the country’s worst recorded outbreak of foot and mouth disease - and inconveniently it came before British herds had been fully recovered from an earlier epidemic of mad cow disease (BSE). It was estimated that up to 2% of the cattle burned were infected with BSE, and burning them in open fields was potentially dangerous. Sandy Sullivan “Ideally you would burn them in an incinerator, which is a controlled environment, but because of the vast quantity of cattle they were burning them in fields,” says the biochemist Sandy Sullivan. “And that actually has the potential of spreading BSE because of particles going up in the atmosphere.” Sullivan spent five years lobbying the EU to allow a process that would completely sterilise infected carcasses. The company he worked for, WR2, had patented an alkaline hydrolysis tissue digester, and was already using it to destroy the remains of animals from research laboratories. In the end, alkaline hydrolysis was not used to dissolve Europe’s BSE-infected cattle, though it was used in the US to dispose of elk and sheep infected with similar diseases. Animal disposal in a tissue digester(Joe Wilson) The development that led to tissue digesters turning up in funeral parlours came a couple of years later, when Dean Fisher, director of anatomical donations at the world-renowned Mayo Clinic in Minnesota, started exploring the idea of using alkaline hydrolysis to dispose of the clinic’s cadavers. He and a colleague got the chance to inspect a machine installed at a hospital in Florida, and were impressed with what they saw. “We were like, ‘Oh my God, look at that finished product!’” Fisher says, referring to the pure white bones that were left at the end of the process. However, they felt that the top-loading machine, designed to process several bodies at once, was undignified. “It closed like a clam and we didn’t like that,” Fisher recalls. “We said, ‘Can you turn that cylinder in the other direction? Can you place a basket or tray in it with little holes that can move the fluid around during the course of the cycle and afterwards all the bone and all the prosthetics and everything are sitting in the tray?’ And that is what they designed for us.” The new digester was an early prototype for the machine at Bradshaw’s in Stillwater, though it wasn’t quite so easy to use. Before each process the operator had to tighten 11 bolts on the door with a spanner, like a mechanic replacing a bus wheel. But Sullivan saw the potential for the technology to be used commercially in funeral parlours. Sandy Sullivan with a resomation machine(Alamy) After WR2 went bust in 2006 he formed a new company, Resomation Ltd, while his former CEO at WR2, Joe Wilson, formed another company, Bio-Response Solutions - and the two became the Pepsi and Coke of alkaline hydrolysis. The last decade has been a challenging one for both men. “It’s a conservative market,” says Sullivan. “When you come in with a new idea, you know, it kind of puts the cat among the pigeons and you’re not easily accepted.” It was the same for the pioneers of cremation, in the late 19th Century. In the UK, when the Cremation Society built a crematorium in Woking in 1879, the townspeople protested - leading the home secretary to ban the practice until Parliament approved the idea, and introduced legislation to govern it. Woking Crematorium, Surrey, UK(Alamy) As it turned out, the advocates of cremation did not have to wait that long. In 1884, a well-known Welsh eccentric and self-styled druid, William Price, attempted to cremate his infant son’s dead body on a hilltop in Llantrisant. He was arrested, but at his trial he argued that no laws stated cremation was illegal - and the judge agreed. Price was acquitted and Woking crematorium began operations the following year, without waiting for regulation. William Price(Alamy) Several more crematoria were built in the UK before the Cremation Act was passed in 1902. It then took decades for the practice to become completely accepted. It was only in the late 1960s that cremations outnumbered burials, and today there are three cremations for every one burial. In the US, the process has been much slower. Over the past few years cremation has gradually been reaching parity with burial, and may now have overtaken it. The regulatory vacuum that once surrounded cremation in the UK is now repeated with regard to alkaline hydrolysis. “It’s a Catch-22,” says Sullivan. “We’ve been waiting for them to pass a law to regulate it, but it’s not going to happen. So we’re going to install one and force them to pass primary legislation to allow us to be regulated - because we want to be regulated.” Planning permission has been granted for a Resomation machine to be fitted at Rowley Regis Crematorium in Sandwell in the West Midlands, though the water authority has yet to issue a permit for the effluent to be drained into the sewer. Sullivan says he does not expect a problem. The cost of such a machine is equivalent to, or slightly less than, the cost of filtration equipment that crematoria in the UK have fitted to capture mercury emissions. Touch screen on a resomation machine But Harvey Thomas, chairman of the Cremation Society and chairman of the board that owns Woking Crematorium, says the business case is not sewn up. If the people who might choose alkaline hydrolysis are the people who would otherwise have chosen cremation, there is no commercial benefit for the crematorium, he points out. “Commercially, all you are doing is losing one procedure and switching it to another. Whereas, in order to be commercially profitable, you would have to have people who were previously going to be buried deciding to do Resomation.” He also notes that it only takes an hour to incinerate a body in a cremator, while Sullivan’s machine, the fastest on the market, takes three or four times that long to digest a body. So the potential income per day is lower. If North America has been slower than the UK to warm to cremation, it is well ahead with alkaline hydrolysis. It has been approved in three Canadian provinces (accounting for two-thirds of the population) and 14 US states, with a further five states mulling legislation at the moment. It has been an uphill struggle though. A state’s funeral rules are written into law by the local Board of Funeral Directors and Embalmers. Too often, Bio-Response’s Joe Wilson says, they are a “good ol’ boy” network that sees no value in challenging their successful business models. And in at least four states, the Catholic Church has played a critical role in blocking alkaline hydrolysis. Dissolving bodies in a vat of chemicals and pouring the resultant liquid down the drain is not a respectful way to dispose of human remains.” So reads a letter from the Catholic Conference of Ohio to the state legislature in 2012. The previous year, the California Catholic Conference had written: “As Catholics we believe that the human body, once alive and animated by an immortal soul, possesses a moral dignity which must be honoured.” Similar letters were sent by the Church to lawmakers in New York and New Hampshire, and partly because of these interventions, alkaline hydrolysis is not currently legal in any of these states. It’s not just the Catholic Church that takes this view. (Getty Images) The tipping away of the tea-coloured effluent troubles some people, whether they are Catholic or not. “That creeps them out,” Philip Olson, a philosopher at Virginia Tech who has charted the rise of alkaline hydrolysis. It seems like you’re treating Grandma or any loved one like waste. That you’re just flushing them away. It seems disrespectful, it seems irreverent.” But Olson, who once worked as an embalming assistant, points out that in the traditional processes of burial, cremation and embalming a distinction is made between funeral “product” - for example, the ashes - and “waste”. “If you look at the process of embalming, all of the blood that is drained from the body and the viscera that are extracted through the aspiration of the body cavity are sent down the drain as well,” he says. And unlike the effluent from alkaline hydrolysis, these blood and guts contain human DNA. It’s not just the Catholic Church that takes this view.

And unlike the effluent from alkaline hydrolysis, these blood and guts contain human DNA. Within the Catholic community, the ethicist Sister Renee Mirkes makes a similar point. “The flashpoint of indignity with alkaline hydrolysis - specifically, pouring the liquid remains down the drain - is found in a similar form in the seepage after burial and in cremation through rain,” she wrote in the National Bioethics Quarterly in 2008, referring to the process whereby smoke from a cremation ultimately falls back to Earth, sometimes in raindrops that are washed into drains. In her article Mirkes notes that cremation was in effect prohibited in the Catholic Church until 1963, when Pope Paul VI ruled that while burial remained the preferred method for disposing of bodies, cremation was not intrinsically evil and the faithful were free to choose it when necessity dictated. She argues that the Church’s position on cremation should apply to green cremation too, although she suggests it should be left to bishops to advise the faithful in their dioceses. One reason attitudes to alkaline hydrolysis vary, Philip Olson says, is that people have different concepts of the corpse. For some, the dead body is primarily a sacred object, while for others it is something dangerous, to be sealed away underground within layers of steel and concrete. Body in an alkaline hydrolysis machine The real fans of alkaline hydrolysis are those in the “eco-death” movement, he says, who see the body as a potential source of nourishment for plants and animals. The unloved effluent makes very good fertiliser - Joe Wilson says that some of his veterinary customers spray it on their lawns. Even when the tea-coloured liquid goes to the drain, it serves a useful purpose - it reportedly helps feed the bacteria in water treatment plants. This is not an aspect of alkaline hydrolysis that you are likely to see in any promotional materials. When legislation on alkaline hydrolysis was drafted in New York, a few commentators drew a link with the 1973 dystopian movie Soylent Green, which imagines an America of the future in which dead bodies are recycled into high-energy green biscuits. Others dubbed the legislation, which failed, “Hannibal Lecter’s Bill”, a reference to a series of novels by Thomas Harris, about a serial killer who ate his victims. Some funeral parlours that offer the service keep quiet about it, for fear of upsetting the community. But market research has found that while a minority will always find the idea of alkaline hydrolysis unpleasant, if it is marketed in the right way - perhaps as green cremation, bio-cremation or water cremation - a section of the public can see its benefits. Barbara Kemmis, the executive director of CANA, the Cremation Association of North America, relates a conversation about alkaline hydrolysis with two delegates at the recent International Cemetery, Cremation and Funeral Association Convention in Nashville. “This person was just so disgusted by it, didn’t even want to have the conversation,” she recalls, “and the other person was like, ‘For me, that’s like a final spa treatment.’ “I’d never heard that before, but I thought, ‘OK!’ It’s just so personal, this kind of ick factor. The point is to have choices, right?” Jason Bradshaw’s 73-year-old father Jim has seen many changes in his business over the years - not only the rise of cremation, and the arrival of alkaline hydrolysis, which has proved so popular at the Bradshaw Celebration of Life Center. Jim Bradshaw “Fifty years ago people came in to visit with you and they’d say, ‘At my church we do it this way,’” he recalls. “People come in today, and they say, ‘Well, we’re not sure what we’re going to do. We might have it at a local bar. We might have it in a park. Well, I don’t know - maybe we’ll have it in the church, and by the way, will they let us serve liquor?’” Surprisingly, he hasn’t made a final decision about what will happen to his own body after he dies. He doesn’t much like the idea of flame cremation, but he’s not sure about green cremation either. I have wondered what happens inside the vessel with the water. I would like to see that. But unfortunately - or maybe fortunately - I can’t see it.” It’s seriously tempting, he says, to instruct the firm to bury him in a casket that has been kicking around the storeroom for a long time - “it’s one way to get rid of it.” But at the moment, he likes the idea of a natural burial best - no casket, no steel or concrete-lined vault, just a blanket around him to keep him warm.

"Theresa May became Britain's second female prime minister last July but, unlike her predecessor Margaret Thatcher, she came to power without winning an election. The Conservative leader had hoped to put that right by convincing voters that she was the tough, competent leader the country needed to steer it through difficult times. But her decision to call a snap election left her facing the humiliation of ending with fewer seats than when she called the vote. A Conservative colleague once called her ""a bloody difficult woman"", when he thought no-one was listening, and shenow wears that description as a badge of honour. Others have described her as ""rigid"" and ""inflexible"". But until she moved into Downing Street, following the resignation of David Cameron, she was, in truth, something of a mystery, even to many in her own party. She is an intensely private politician, by modern standards, and has rarely opened up about her personal feelings or beliefs. Celebrating her elevation to the Tory leadership with husband Philip Like Mr Cameron, she had been against Brexit but she cleverly managed to keep the Eurosceptics in her party on side during the referendum campaign by keeping a low profile. She reaped her reward byemerging as the unchallenged successor to Mr Cameron, as other potential rivals fell by the wayside - portraying herself as a steady pair of hands who would deliver the will of the people and take Britain out of the EU in as orderly a fashion as possible. But that image was called into question by some when she announced a snap general election, after previously insisting she did not want to go to the country before she had to, in 2020, to avoid unnecessary instability. Out meeting - and eating with - the people Her reasoning for the snap poll - that she wanted to strengthen her hand in Brexit negotiations - was attacked by critics on the left as a divisive move, designed to stifle legitimate criticism and paint anyone who disagreed with her approach to talks with Brussels as a ""Brexit wrecker"". Her tub-thumping vows to ""fight for Britain"" went down a storm with the right-wing press, who embraced her in a way that they never did Mr Cameron, whom they tended to see as a privileged member of the ""Metropolitan elite"". But her repeated offer of ""strong and stable"" leadership was not enough to win her an overall majority. This video can not be played A look at Theresa May's journey to the top job Date of birth:1 October 1956 (aged 60) Job:MP for Maidenhead since 1997. Home Secretary since May 2010 Education:Mainly state-educated at Wheatley Park Comprehensive School with a brief time at an independent school; St Hugh's College, Oxford Family:Married to Philip May Hobbies:Cooking - she says she owns 100 recipe books. Occasional mountain walks. On BBC Radio 4's Desert Island Discs in 2014, she chose Abba's Dancing Queen and Walk Like A Man, from the musical Jersey Boys, among her picks, alongside Mozart and Elgar. Shechose a subscription to Vogue as her luxury item, reflecting her lifelong love of high fashion. The daughter of a Church of England vicar, Hubert, who died from injuries sustained in a car crash when she was 25, Mrs May said her father had taught her to ""take people as you find them"" and ""treat everyone equally"". Born in Eastbourne, East Sussex, but raised largely in Oxfordshire, she attended a state primary, an independent convent school and then a grammar school in the village of Wheatley, which became the Wheatley Park Comprehensive School during her time there. The young Theresa Brasier, as she was then, threw herself into village life, taking part in a pantomime that was produced by her father and working in the bakery on Saturdays to earn pocket money. She has described growing up in a vicarage as ""different"" but useful because ""you get to meet a whole range of people from all types of background"". Theresa May married her husband Philip in 1980 Friends recall a tall, fashion-conscious young woman who, from an early age, spoke of her ambition to be the first woman prime minister. Like Margaret Thatcher, she went to Oxford University to study and, like so many others of her generation, found that her personal and political lives soon became closely intertwined. In 1976, in her third year, she met her husband Philip, who was two years younger than her and president of the Oxford Union, a well-known breeding ground for future political leaders. They were introduced at a Conservative Association disco by future Pakistani prime minister Benazir Bhutto. Both claim it was ""love at first sight"".  They married in 1980. The young Theresa Brasier at a function in the village hall Her university friend Pat Frankland, speaking in 2011 on a BBC Radio 4 profile of the then home secretary, said: ""I cannot remember a time when she did not have political ambitions. ""I well remember, at the time, that she did want to become the first woman prime minister and she was quite irritated when Margaret Thatcher got there first."" Mrs May says she wanted to be an MP as a child but does not recognise stories about her early prime ministerial ambitions. In their first broadcast interview together,on the BBC's The One Show, Philip May, a City fund manager, said he had ""never heard Theresa say she wanted to be prime minister until she was well-established in the shadow cabinet"".

There are no tales of drunken student revelry from Mrs May's time at Oxford, but Pat Frankland and other friends say she was not the austere figure she would later come to be seen as, suggesting she had a sense of fun and a full social life. After graduating with a degree in geography, May went to work in the City, initially starting work at the Bank of England and later rising to become head of the European Affairs Unit of the Association for Payment Clearing Services. But it was already clear that she saw her future in politics. She was elected as a local councillor in Merton, south London, and served her ward for a decade, rising to become deputy leader. However, she was soon setting her sights even higher. Mrs May, who has become a confidante as well as role model for aspiring female MPs, told prospective candidates before the 2015 election that ""there is always a seat out there with your name on it"". ""She is instinctively secretive and very rigid, but you can be tough with her and she'll go away and think it all through again,"" former Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg. ""Theresa is a bloody difficult woman... I get on all right with her and she is good. She's too narrow on her department... She's been at the Home Office far too long... she doesn't know much about foreign affairs,"" veteran Conservative MP Ken Clarke, pictured. ""She hides when things go wrong. No interviews, no quotes, nothing to reassure people or to remind people she even exists,"" former shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper. ""The prime minister has a strict trio of personal topics that she is prepared to discuss in public: shoes, clothes and cooking. Beyond that, she is content to let voters judge her on achievements,"" Sebastian Payne,writing in the Financial Times.,external Theresa May is seen here as a child with her parents Zaidee and Hubert In her case - like that of Margaret Thatcher - it took a bit of time for her to find hers. She first dipped her toe in the water in 1992, where she stood in the safe Labour seat of North West Durham, coming a distant second to Hilary Armstrong, who went on to become Labour's chief whip in the Blair government. Her fellow candidates in that contest also included a very youthful Tim Farron, who is now Lib Dem leader. Two years later, she stood in Barking, east London, in a by-election where - with the Conservative government at the height of its unpopularity - she got fewer than 2,000 votes and saw her vote share dip more than 20%. But her luck was about to change. The Conservatives' electoral fortunes may have hit a nadir in 1997, when Tony Blair came to power in a Labour landslide, but there was a silver lining for the party and for the aspiring politician when she won the seat of Maidenhead in Berkshire, having beaten her future chancellor Philip Hammond to be selected as the candidate. It's a seat she has held ever since. Mrs May first stood for Parliament in 1992 in North West Durham Theresa May has described her husband Philip as her rock Theresa May bumps into rock star Alice Cooper outside a BBC studio in 2010 An early advocate of Conservative ""modernisation"" in the wilderness years that followed, Mrs May quickly joined the shadow cabinet in 1999, under William Hague, as shadow education secretary and in 2002 she became the party's first female chairman under Iain Duncan Smith. Shelaunched a drive to get more women selected,externalas Conservative candidates in winnable seats but antagonised the party's grass roots by telling them in a conference speech that they were still seen by some as ""the nasty party"" and had to change their ways. Some activists struggled to forgive her for that but it was an early sign of her willingness to deliver unpalatable home truths. As home secretary, she was booed offstage by angry officers at the Police Federation annual conference, after she had told them they should welcome her reforms and ""stop pretending"" they were being ""picked on"" by the government. After Iain Duncan Smith's brief, chaotic reign as Tory leader, Mrs May held a range of senior posts under his successor Michael Howard. But she was conspicuously not part of the ""Notting Hill set"" which grabbed control of the party after its third successive defeat in 2005 and laid David Cameron and George Osborne's path to power. Theresa May, back row, right, in the 1999 shadow cabinet This was perhaps reflected in the fact that she was initially given the rather underwhelming job of shadow leader of the House of Commons. But she gradually raised her standing and by 2009 had become shadow work and pensions secretary. Nevertheless, her promotion to the job of home secretary when the Conservatives joined with the Lib Dems to form the first coalition government in 70 years was still something of a surprise - given that Chris Grayling had been shadowing the brief in opposition. While the Home Office turned out to be the political graveyard of many a secretary of state in previous decades, Mrs May refused to let this happen - mastering her brief with what was said to be a microscopic attention to detail and no little willingness to enter into battles with fellow ministers when she thought it necessary. Theresa May initially fell down the pecking order under David Cameron but worked her way back up While some in Downing Street worried that the Home Office was becoming her own personal fiefdom, she engendered loyalty among her ministers and was regarded as ""unmovable"" as her tough-talking style met with public approval even when the department's record did not always seem so strong. In his memoir of his time in office, former Lib Dem minister David Laws says: ""She would frequently clash with George Osborne over immigration. She rarely got on anything but badly with Michael Gove. She and Cameron seemed to view each other with mutual suspicion. ""I first met her in 2010. I was sitting in my Treasury office, overlooking St James's Park, me in one armchair and the home secretary in the other, with no officials present. She looked nervous. ""I felt she was surprised to find herself as home secretary. Frankly, I didn't expect her to last more than a couple of years."" Despite her liberal instincts in some policy areas, she frequently clashed with the then deputy prime minister and Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg, particularly over her plan to increase internet surveillance to combat terrorism, dubbed the ""snooper's charter"" by the Lib Dems. After one ""difficult"" meeting with Mr Clegg, he reportedly told David Laws: ""You know, I've grown to rather like Theresa May... She's a bit of an ice maiden and has no small talk whatsoever - none. I have quite difficult meetings with her. Cameron once said, 'She's exactly like that with me too!'"" Mrs May confronted what she sees as vested interests in the police The Conservative leader is a self-declared feminist On the plus side, crime levels fell, the UK avoided a large-scale terrorist attack and in 2013, she successfully deported radical cleric Abu Qatada - something she listed as one of her proudest achievements, along with preventing the extradition to America of computer hacker Gary McKinnon. However, the Passport Office suffered a near meltdown and she faced constant criticism over the government's failure to meet its promise to get net migration down to below 100,000 a year. Despite the fact that she never came close to meeting this target, she has consistently refused to drop it. Labour MP Yvette Cooper, who went up against her in the Commons as shadow home secretary,told the Guardian:,external""I respect her style - it is steady and serious. She is authoritative in parliament - superficial attacks on her bounce off. ""The flip side is that she is not fleet of foot when crises build, she digs in her heels (remember the Passport Agency crisis in 2014 when the backlog caused hundreds to miss their holidays, and the Border Force crisis in 2011 when border checks were axed). ""And she hides when things go wrong. No interviews, no quotes, nothing to reassure people or to remind people she even exists. It's helped her survive as home secretary - but if you are prime minister, eventually the buck has to stop."" There was abitter public row with cabinet colleague Michael Goveover the best way to combat Islamist extremism, which ended with Mr Gove having to apologise to the prime minister and Mrs May having to sack a long-serving special adviser. Former Conservative chancellor Ken Clarke also had run-ins with her and was recorded on camera saying that Mrs May was good at her job but a ""bloody difficult woman"", a bit like his former boss Mrs Thatcher. She has rarely opened up about her private life although she revealed in 2013 that she had been diagnosed with type 1 diabetes and would require insulin injections twice a day for the rest of her life - something she says she had come to terms with and which would not affect her career. Mrs May's taste in footwear has kept photographers interested for more than a decade Generally thought to be in the mainstream of Conservative thinking on most economic and law and order issues, she has also challenged convention by attacking police stop and search powers and calling for a probe into the application of Sharia law in British communities. She also expressed a personal desire to withdraw from the European Convention on Human Rights but later said she would not pursue this as PM due to a lack of parliamentary support - an example of what many believe will be pragmatism in office. Her social attitudes are slightly harder to pin down. She backed same-sex marriage. She expressed a personal view in 2012 that the legal limit on abortion should be lowered from 24 to 20 weeks. Along with most Conservative MPs she voted against an outright ban on foxhunting and has since promised a free vote on the issue. What is undisputable is that at 59, Mrs May was the oldest leader to enter Downing Street since James Callaghan in 1976 and is the first prime minister since Ted Heath who does not have children. She toldthe Mail on Sunday,externalabout the impact that being told they could not have children had had on the couple's marriage. ""Of course, we were both affected by it. You see friends who now have grown-up children, but you accept the hand that life deals you. Sometimes things you wish had happened don't or there are things you wish you'd been able to do, but can't. There are other couples in a similar position."" Jeremy Corbyn - the full story Tim Farron - the full story One of her first acts, on entering Downing Street, was to sack Chancellor George Osborne, which seemed to signal a clean break with the past. But, to the surprise of many, she also rescued Boris Johnson's career by appointing him foreign secretary. She announced that her government would focus on the more neglected parts of Britain and try to help people on modest incomes who were ""just about managing"" - seen by some as a grab for traditional Labour territory. It recently emerged,externalthat her top policy adviser, Nick Timothy, who has written the Conservative election manifesto, has held talks with Labour peer Lord Glasman, one of former Labour leader Ed Miliband's policy gurus. Some of the ideas championed by Mr Miliband, including a cap on energy prices - described by David Cameron at the time as Marxist - have been echoed by Mrs May, as she shows a willingness to intervene in the free market in a way that would be anathema to many on the Tory right. She has also backed new grammar schools, ending decades of political consensus on selective education, and ditched Mr Osborne's deficit reduction target. Her room for manoeuvre on other issues was limited by her tiny Commons majority, although her brief time in Downing Street so far has, inevitably, been dominated by the process of divorcing the UK from the EU. She triggered Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty at the end of March, starting the formal two-year process that will take Britain out of the 28-nation bloc. Theresa May launched an attack on EU officials But despite winning a first Commons vote backing her position, she decided she needed to strengthen her grip on power to help her negotiate the kind of Brexit she wants - taking Britain out of the single market and being prepared to walk away without a trade deal if necessary. She refused to take part in a televised leaders' debate, taking her cues from the safety-first strategy of campaign chief Sir Lynton Crosby, who steered David Cameron to his unexpected victory in 2015. But she was not afraid to use the Brexit talks as an electioneering tool. After initially dismissing reports of a bust-up with EU officials as ""Brussels gossip"", she decided to go on the attack. Speaking after returning from Buckingham Palace, where she had informed the Queen that Parliament had been dissolved, she said: ""Threats against Britain have been issued by European politicians and officials. ""All of these acts have been deliberately timed to affect the result of the general election which will take place on 8 June."" Her vow to ""fight for Britain"" played well in the next day's newspapers even if it left some wondering how it would affect the mood of the talks. Mrs May wanted a mandate of her own to avoid being held to ransom on domestic policies by her own backbenchers, as well as to free her from the manifesto promises made by David Cameron in 2015. But her repeated offer of ""strong and stable"" leadership was not enough to win her an overall majority.

"Karabo Mokoena's killing is being seen as symbolic of the wider violence faced by women in South Africa A white coffin carries the remains of Karabo Mokoena. Her friends and family have gathered to say an untimely goodbye to their loved one. She was found dead, burnt beyond recognition and buried in a shallow grave in a deserted field, several days after she went missing. It is alleged that her boyfriend Sandile Mantsoe doused her body with acid and then set her alight when she threatened to leave him. Mr Mantsoe has been charged with murder and defeating the ends of justice but has not pleaded. The 22-year-old's death is the most recent case of femicide to have sparked public outrage. She was buried in Johannesburg's Soweto township. 1 in 5 women are assaulted by their partner More than 40,000 cases of rape are reported every year, most of the victims are female Femicide in South Africa is 5 times higher than the global average Source:Medical Research Council 2009 study; Stats SA Demographic and Health Survey 2016 Adele Tjale, one of the thousands of mourners gathered at her memorial, was visibly angered by her death. She is a leader in a church Ms Mokoena attended and has been described as her ""spiritual mother"". ""I'm livid, this cannot be the norm, too many girls are dyingâ¦ the fathers of this nation have failed the girl child,"" she said as tears rolled down her face. Since Ms Mokoena's death, the bodies of four more women have been found in different parts of the country - all had died in similarly horrific ways. The spate of these brutal crimes has generated a lot of comment on social media. Women have used the hashtag #MenAreTrash to share stories of domestic violence. It has brought to light a series of gut-wrenching tales of near-death experiences. One such story was Bukelwa Moerane's. One evening in February, she was abducted at a Soweto taxi rank by a stranger on her way back from a shopping trip. This video can not be played Bukelwa Moerane survived a kidnapping in Johannesburg ""A man walked up behind me and told me to get into his car and not try anything stupid,"" said the 24-year-old who lost some of her teeth and was left badly scarred after the incident. ""He kept swearing at me, calling me names and told me he was going to rape and kill me. ""I knew I had to find a way out of this mess,"" she told me while nervously cracking her knuckles. Ms Moerane managed to jump out of the speeding car and run for a few kilometres to call for help. But no-one has been arrested. ""If I didn't jump, I knew I was going to die. I was willing to die while fighting for my life,"" she said as she choked back tears. President Jacob Zuma described ""the manner in which women and children are being killed"" as a ""crisis in the country"". He urged victims of gender violence not to turn a blind eye to the problem and added that he would consider calls for harsher sentences for sex offenders. A2016 study by Statistics SA,externalfound that 1 in 5 women report that they have experienced violence at the hands of a partner. Furthermore it found that 8% of women reported experiencing violence in the previous 12-month period, while 6% reported sexual violence by a partner. South Africa has one of the highest rates of sexual violence in the world While there is renewed public outrage about the spate of violence against women, it is not a new problem. ""This is one of our episodic outbreaks of memory interspersed with amnesia,"" said Lisa Vetten, a researcher into gender-based violence at the University of Witwatersrand in Johannesburg. ""I'm sure this one will die down and the country will be outraged again when this crops up again."" Sonke Gender Justice, a Johannesburg-based NGO that focuses on tackling the issue, has been organising workshops for both men and women in several parts of the country to raise awareness. But will men talk? It would appear so. At the workshop I attended in Soweto, some were justifying reasons for physically abusing their partners. ""Women are very stubborn, they're pushy and there are limits to what a woman can get away with when she talks to meâ¦ I end up lifting my hand to command respect,"" said Mzwakhe Ndhlovu. But a woman, who was also a taking part, disagreed. ""I lost respect for my partner after he hit me - everything I did from that day on was out of fear and not respect,"" said Philile Nkumane. These men took part in a workshop on tackling gender-based violence Most agree that changing attitudes will not be easy. ""Outrage is not sufficient, there's no app or quick-fix solution, this problem needs ongoing attention"" said Ms Vetten. Despite the fact that, according to a2009 study,external, on average three women are killed by their partners every day in South Africa, the conviction rate for such cases remains very low. Just as the friends of Karabo Mokoena continue to ask why she had to die in such a brutal way, so parents across South Africa are asking what more can be done to keep their daughters safe. But many women are living in fear and asking themselves: ""Will I be next?""

"This video can not be played The pizza chain that's a hit in Vietnam While proud Italians might balk at some of the pizza toppings Yosuke Masuko offers, they'd have to appreciate his obsession with quality control. The 38-year-old Japanese expat is the founder of one of the most popular pizza chains in Vietnam, Pizza 4Ps. With six busy restaurants in the country's three largest cities - Ho Chi Minh City (formerly Saigon), Hanoi and Da Nang - it serves more than 3,000 customers every day. They flock to the outlets to try such pizza delights as salmon miso cream, teriyaki chicken, and ginger fried pork. With more traditional pizzas also available, such as margarita and Parma ham, such is Mr Masuko's attention to detail that when the first restaurant opened in Ho Chi Minh City in 2011, he would refuse to accept payment for any pizzas that weren't perfectly round. And importing key ingredients from Italy, including the flour and tomato sauce, he worried that the imported Italian mozzarella wasn't fresh enough because of the long cargo flight, and the fact he could only get deliveries twice a week. Yosuke runs the business with his wife Sanae So Mr Masuko decided he would make his own. As the cheese didn't exist in Vietnam he couldn't ask anyone locally for help, so instead he learned to make it himself by studying YouTube videos. Then unhappy with the quality of milk he was able to buy in Vietnam, he bought a farm and his own cows. Some might say this is a little too obsessive, but Mr Masuko says he wouldn't have it any other way. ""The mission of our restaurant is 'delivering wow, sharing happiness',"" he says. ""To pursue our mission we keep in mind to always go beyond customer expectations."" The company also sells more traditional, Italian-style pizzas While neither the Japanese nor the Vietnamese are renowned for their pizza eating, Mr Masuko first started making them in 2004 when he installed a wood-fired pizza oven in his garden in Tokyo. ""The experience of making your own pizza with friends every weekend made me realise that I can make people happy by serving good food in a good space,"" he says. However, it wasn't until seven years later that Mr Masuko decided to start making pizza for a living. By that time he was living in Vietnam where he worked for a Japanese investment firm. Fascinated by Vietnam's rising middle class, he noticed that global pizza chains such as Pizza Hut and Domino's were opening up in the country and proving popular. As Vietnam had been a former French colony, the country was used to bread products, particularly baguettes, so pizza didn't prove too much of a jump for most people. The restaurants are popular among Vietnam's growing middle class So with fond memories of his own pizza-making exploits Mr Masuko quit his job and used his $100,000 (Â£77,000) savings to open the first branch of Pizza 4Ps in central Ho Chi Minh City. The 4Ps part of the unusual name stands ""for peace"". He explains: ""In the name 4Ps is our wish for inner peace and richness of hearts."" Looking back, Mr Masuko says that quitting his investment job was not a decision he took lightly. ""Everything was fine with my previous job back then,"" he says. ""The company even provided accommodation, and my eldest daughter was three when we opened the first restaurant. ""Of course I was afraid that the restaurant wasn't going to work, but at the same time I felt like I needed to take the challenge."" The restaurants are located in busy central locations Thankfully for Mr Masuko his restaurant was an immediate hit, and the company has grown steadily ever since. From 10 workers to begin with, it now has 700 full-time Vietnamese staff and 13 Japanese employees, five of whom have management roles. Mr Masuko says that when the first restaurant opened, 90% of its customers were Japanese expats, 5% Vietnamese and 5% other foreign nationals. Today more than 70% of diners are Vietnamese. Pizza 4Ps also sells sweet, dessert pizzas In addition to making its own cheese, Pizza 4Ps also arranges for Vietnamese farmers to grow it vegetables such as rocket and lettuces. The company also sells some of its cheese to hotels and other restaurants. Mr Masuko says: ""In 2016 we had a turnover of $7.5m, and in 2017 we expect $15m."" Ultimately the aim is to float the company on a stock exchange, and open branches in other countries. To help run the business Mr Masuko relies on his wife Sanae, whom he met when they both worked for the same Japanese investment fund. The business has both Vietnamese and Japanese staff While  Mr Masuko has the chief executive role, Sanae looks after staffing matters and marketing. Rather than pick Japanese or Vietnamese as the working language at Pizza 4Ps, staff are instead encouraged to talk to each other in English. Mr Masuko admits that this can occasionally cause communication problems, but says that cultural differences can sometimes be the biggest problem. Sanae explains: ""We found the gap of working culture between Vietnamese and Japanese is the one that is difficult to bridge... but things are improving."" Yosuke meditates every day before work Hang Do, vice president of Seedcom, a Vietnamese investment fund, says she wasn't surprised that Pizza 4Ps has done so well. ""For the past five years, as the economy has grown, the middle class has grown very fast as well, and people have just been more open-minded to the diversity of food and beverages,"" she says. ""Pizza 4Ps offers a very unique flavour."" Mr Masuko says he is confident that the Vietnamese pizza market will continue to grow, and he is putting in the hours to ensure that Pizza 4Ps continues to be a success. ""I go to the office at 9am, and I do work 13 hours a day. I am devoting my life to working.""

"The contraceptive pill had profound social consequences. Everyone agrees with that. In fact, that was the point. Margaret Sanger, the birth control activist who urged scientists to develop it, wanted to liberate women sexually and socially, to put them on a more equal footing with men. But the pill wasn't just socially revolutionary. It also sparked an economic revolution - perhaps the most significant economic change of the late 20th Century. 50 Things That Made the Modern Economyhighlights the inventions, ideas and innovations which have helped create the economic world in which we live. It is broadcast on the BBC World Service. You can findmore information about the programme's sourcesandlisten onlineorsubscribe to the programme podcast. To see why, first consider what the pill offered to women. For a start, it worked - unlike many of the other options. Over the centuries, lovers have tried all kinds of unappealing tricks to prevent pregnancy. There was crocodile dung in ancient Egypt, Aristotle's recommendation of cedar oil, and Casanova's method of using half a lemon as a cervical cap. But even the obvious modern alternative to the pill - condoms - have a failure rate. Margaret Sanger opened the first US family planning centre in New York in 1916, when contraception and abortion were illegal Because people don't tend to use them exactly as they're supposed to, they sometimes rip or slip. So for every 100 sexually active women using condoms for a year, 18 will become pregnant. The failure rate of the sponge is similar. The diaphragm isn't much better. But the failure rate of the pill - with typical use - is just 6%, three times safer than condoms. Used perfectly, the failure rate drops to one twentieth of that. Using a condom meant negotiating with a partner. The diaphragm and sponge were messy. But the decision to use the pill was a woman's, and it was private and discreet. No wonder women wanted it. The pill was first approved in the United States in 1960. In just five years, almost half of married women on birth control were using it. But the real revolution would come when unmarried women got access to oral contraceptives. That took time. But in around 1970 - 10 years after the pill was first approved - US state after US state started to make it easier for single women to get the pill. Universities opened family planning centres. By the mid-1970s, the pill was overwhelmingly the most popular form of contraception for 18 and 19-year-old women in the US. The Planned Parenthood organisation distributed information and contraception across the US And that was when the economic revolution really began. Women in America started studying particular kinds of degrees - law, medicine, dentistry and MBAs - which had previously been very masculine. In 1970, medical degrees were over 90% male. Law degrees and MBAs were over 95% male. Dentistry degrees were 99% male. But at the beginning of the 1970s -  equipped with the pill - women surged into all these courses. At first, women made up a fifth of the class, then a quarter. By 1980 they often made up a third. This wasn't simply because women became more likely to go to university. Women who'd already decided to be students opted for these professional courses. The proportion of female students studying subjects such as medicine and law rose dramatically, and logically enough, the presence of women in the professions rose sharply shortly afterwards. But what did this have to do with the pill? By giving women control over their fertility, it allowed them to invest in their careers. These Harvard graduates could take for granted the freedom to develop their careers before having children, if they wished Before the pill was available, taking five years or more to qualify as a doctor or lawyer didn't look like a good use of time and money. To reap the benefits of those courses, a woman would need to be able to reliably delay motherhood until she was 30 at least. Having a baby at the wrong time risked derailing her studies or delaying her professional progress. A sexually active woman who tried to become a doctor, dentist or lawyer was doing the equivalent of building a factory in an earthquake zone: just one bit of bad luck and the expensive investment would be trashed. Of course, women could simply abstain from sex if they wanted to study for a professional career. But many didn't want to. And it wasn't just about having fun. It was also about finding a husband. Before the pill, people married young. A woman who decided to abstain from sex while developing her career might try to find a husband at the age of 30 and find that, quite literally, all the good men had been taken. The pill changed both those dynamics. It meant that unmarried women could have sex with substantially less risk of an unwanted pregnancy. But it also changed the whole pattern of marriage. Everyone started to marry later, even women who didn't use the pill. The 1973 landmark Roe v Wade case legalised abortion in the US, allowing women further control over their fertility Babies started to arrive later, and at a time of women's own choosing. And that meant that women, at least, had time to establish a professional career. Of course, many other things changed for American women in the 1970s. Abortion was legalised, laws against sex discrimination were put in place, feminism emerged as a movement, and the drafting of young men to fight in Vietnam forced employers to recruit more women. Buta careful statistical study by the Harvard economists Claudia Goldin and Lawrence Katz,externalstrongly suggests that the pill must have played a major role in allowing women to delay marriage and motherhood, and invest in their own careers. Goldin and Katz tracked the availability of the pill to young women in the US, state by state. They show that as each state opened up access to contraception, so the enrolment rate in professional courses soared, and so did women's wages. Grace Hopper's compiler: Computing's hidden hero How economics killed the antibiotic dream Rise of the robots: What advances mean for workers Superstar economics: How the gramophone changed everything A few years ago,the economist Amalia Miller used a variety of clever statistical methods,externalto demonstrate that if a woman in her 20s was able to delay motherhood by one year, her lifetime earnings would rise by 10%. That was some measure of the vast advantage to a woman of completing her studies and securing her career before having children. But the young women of the 1970s didn't need to see Amalia Miller's research: they already knew it was true. As the pill became available, they signed up for long professional courses in undreamt of numbers. American women today can look across the Pacific Ocean for a vision of an alternative reality. Did the lack of widely available contraception contribute to Japan's gender inequality? In Japan, one of the world's most technologically advanced societies, the pill wasn't approved for use until 1999. Japanese women had to wait 39 years longer than their American counterparts for the same contraceptive. In contrast, when the erection-boosting drug Viagra was approved in the US, Japan was just a few months behind. Gender inequality in Japan is widely reckoned to be worse than anywhere else in the developed world, with women continuing to struggle for recognition in the workplace. It is impossible to disentangle cause and effect here, but the experience in the US suggests that it is no coincidence. Delay the pill by two generations, and of course the economic impact on women will be enormous. It is a tiny little pill that continues to transform the world economy.

"The claim:The governments since 2010 have borrowed more than all the Labour governments in history. Reality Check verdict:That's true in cash terms but not when you take into account the growing economy. Among the more eye-catching claims of the campaign so far has been Jeremy Corbyn's repeated assertion that the Conservative-led governments since 2010 have borrowed more money than all Labour governments in history. This can be checked using the Bank of England's handythree centuries of economic data spreadsheet.,external The simplest way to examine this claim is to compare the amounts in cash terms, add up the amounts borrowed by all Labour governments and compare the total with the amount borrowed since 2010. By this calculation, the combined Labour governments borrowed a little more than Â£500bn over their 33 years while the governments since 2010 have borrowed a bit more than Â£670bn. So it's true in cash terms, but is that a fair or useful comparison? During the first Labour government under Ramsay MacDonald in 1924, a loaf of breadcost less than 2d on average.,externalAlso, our economy produces very considerably more today than it did in 1924, which means it is not unreasonable for the government to borrow more. So a better comparison to make is government borrowing as a proportion of GDP, which is a measure of everything produced in the economy. By that measure it turns out that all Labour governments borrowed about 70% of GDP while the governments since 2010 borrowed about 40% of GDP, which is a very different picture. Even that is not necessarily a fair comparison. For example, there was a big fall in debt as a proportion of GDP after 1976, despite Jim Callaghan's government going to the International Monetary Fund for a big loan. That happened because the following years of very high inflation reduced the value of the government's debts.

"This looks like fun Last summer, on my fourth day of sploshing through Glastonbury's sodden fields, I thought: ""Why do I keep doing this to myself?"" Sure, the music was great. Skepta, Adele and Grimes gave unforgettable, once-in-a-lifetime performances; andPhilip Glass's Heroes Symphony, an orchestral tribute to David Bowie in the dead of the night, was unexpectedly moving. Even Coldplay - previously the only band who'd provoked me to walk out of a concert early - won me over, with a spirited, kaleidoscopic set where every song felt big enough to be an encore. But still, the thought lingered: There must be a better way. And it turns out I wasn't alone. The last decade has seen an explosion in city-based festivals, bringing bands to your doorstep, usually with the added benefit of getting to curl up in your own bed (or someone else's, if you prefer) at the end of the day. ""They're springing up absolutely everywhere,"" says Paul Reed of the Association of Independent Festivals (AIF). ""Just within our membership, we've added around eight city-based festivals in the last couple of years."" One of the newest isBushstock,external, which takes place in Shepherd's Bush. Since it started in 2011, Bushstock has staged early gigs by the likes of Bastille, George Ezra and Michael Kiwanuka in nearby pubs, clubs and railway arches. ""We've had people like Hozier play to 300 people in a church, now he plays in front of tens of thousands of people,"" says Maz Tappuni, who co-founded the festival from his friend's front room eight years ago. ""We've had Bastille at [local pub] Defector's Weld in front of 200 people in 2013. Now they've played the O2 twice."" Bushstock is a modest event, open to just 1,500 people. But tickets start at just Â£18, for which fans can see any of the gigs at any of the venues. The Staves have played Bushstock several times This year's line-up is headlined by singer-songwriter Nick Mulvey and folk-rock trio The Staves, who are returning from a headline tour of America to play a tiny, intimate show at St Stephen's Church. For singer Emily Staveley-Taylor, the size of the event is the main attraction. ""Sometimes, playing festivals can feel like a battle, because 50% of the crowd are there to get wrecked,"" she says. ""I feel that, more and more, the big festivals are becoming an Instagram-fest. At Bushstock, it feels like the focus is music and the people who go there are music fans. ""When you're playing a venue like a church, the acoustics mean you can hear if someone is talking. So when someone's phone goes off, people will glare and tell them to sort their lives out."" For The Defectors' Weld pub, Bushstock has been a shot in the arm during the quiet summer season. ""We have to move all the furniture out, which is something we don't normally do until New Year's Eve,"" says owner John Da Costa. Bands like Matthew and the Atlas attracts hundreds of fans to St Stephen's Church ""Then last year, we tried to get a photographer in here and he just couldn't find the space. He had to climb on the tables and chairs to actually get any photos. It was absolutely packed."" The festival has a knock-on effect during the rest of the year, he adds. ""We get fans who go to gigs at the Shepherd's Bush Empire saying, 'we'll definitely come back for a drink here next time, rather than go somewhere else'. ""It's been a good pull for us, and customers returning, absolutely."" While Bushstock remains a relatively small affair, other urban festivals have grown to a size where they rival ""greenfield"" events like Latitude and Green Man. Sheffield'sTramlines festival,externalstarted out as a free event in 2009; spread across 17 local venues, with acts including The xx and Reverend and the Makers. This year, it boasts three purpose-built outdoor venues, where the likes of Primal Scream, The Libertines and Kano will play to 20,000 people. ""As it's grown, I guess people have demanded more,"" says the festival's co-founder Sarah Nulty. ""We'd get fans saying: 'I bought a ticket to see Billy Bragg, why can't I get in to see him?' and we'd have to say: 'He's playing a 900-capacity venue and you didn't turn up on time - but look at all these other people you can go and see!' ""I guess that's the main reason we moved out of the venues."" Indie legends Primal Scream are the main draw at this year's Tramlines Despite the cost of building and staffing these new stages, costs have been kept down. Tickets for the three-day event start at Â£30, rising to a maximum of Â£45, while kids go free. Glastonbury, by comparison, costs Â£238. ""We're a good-value ticket but if you then factor in the price of a hotel, it can suddenly become unaffordable,"" Nulty acknowledges. ""So what we've tried to do is work with student halls that are empty during the summer, so you can still get a bed and a shower while making the festival affordable."" And, just like Bushstock, the Tramlines festival has given the local economy a boost, with up to 70,000 people descending on Sheffield every July. ""The beauty is that the whole city joins in,"" says Nulty. ""So there's almost two festivals - a bit like Edinburgh where there's the main festival and then you have the fringe. ""Some of our fringe venues have massive, massive line-ups. There was a pub last year that put Deap Vally in their beer garden for free, and they had people climbing over the walls to try and get in. ""It helps make the festival feel amazing, but it's also our competition - because it's free."" So, could these urban festivals eventually replace the likes of Reading & Leeds or the Isle of Wight festival? ""There's still a great appetite for that traditional camping experience,"" says Paul Reed at the AIF. ""But metropolitan festivals serve as great incubators for emerging talent. ""People are more open to discovery. Because the line-up is multiple choice, you can just stumble into something or find your new favourite band by chance."" The Staves, meanwhile, are always more likely to say ""yes"" to a festival with its own roof. ""I've been to festivals in fields where it's been an absolute washout and everyone has left,"" laughs Emily Staveley-Taylor. ""Or you're performing on a stage where the electrics are sparking because of the rain, and you're like, 'What the hell are we doing? ""Why are we staging outdoor festivals in a country where it always rains in the summer?' It's madness to me."" Bushstock takes place on Saturday 10 June, with a line-up including The Staves, The Big Moon and Benjamin Francis Leftwich. Tramlines runs from Friday 21 to Sunday 23 July, featuring performances from Primal Scream, All Saints, The Libertines and Metronomy.

"Wang Quanzhang was detained in August 2015 - and hasn't been seen or heard from since In August 2015 Wang Quanzhang was detained by the Chinese authorities. In that he was not alone. The nationwide series of raids that summer saw more than 200 lawyers, legal assistants and human rights activists brought in for questioning. But almost two years on, Mr Wang is the only lawyer from whom nothing has been heard at all. ""I don't know whether he's alive or dead,"" his wife Li Wenzu told me. ""I have had no information at all. He has simply disappeared from the face of the earth. It is so scary, so brutal."" China's ""709"" crackdown as it's now known - a reference to 9 July, the date it began - is widely seen as a sign of a growing intolerance of dissent under President Xi Jinping. This video can not be played Li Wenzu has not heard from her husband Wang Quanzhang since 2015 Of the large number of people initially detained, around two dozen have been pursued as formal investigations. Over the past year or so those cases have gradually been reaching some kind of a conclusion. Some ofthe accused have been given long jail terms, of up to seven and a half years, for the crime of subversion. Others have beengiven suspended prison sentencesor released on bail, but remain under constant surveillance. But of the lawyers arrested in that initial 2015 sweep, Mr Wang is unique. Apart from one brief written notification of his arrest, the family say he has disappeared into a black hole. Li Wenzu fears her husband is being punished for a failure to compromise ""For these two years, he hasn't been allowed to meet the lawyer that we have employed for him, and he has no right to communicate with the outside world,"" his wife Ms Li said. ""He has been deprived of all rights."" There have been allegations thatsome of the lawyers have been torturedduring their detention, force-fed drugs, shackled, beaten and kept in stress positions for long periods of time. Theiradmissions of guilt, either in court or in the televised confessions that have been broadcast by state-run TV, should not be taken at face value, their supporters argue, but rather as the inevitable consequence of the pressure they've been under. They now fear that Mr Wang's continued incarceration might be because he is holding out. ""I think it might be because my husband hasn't compromised at all,"" Ms Li said. ""That's why his case remains unsolved."" Wang Quanzhang is certainly no stranger to pressure. His work representing the persecuted followers of China's banned spiritual movement, Falun Gong, as well as human rights activists, has attracted the ire of the authorities before. Inthis interview,external, he recounts being beaten in the basement of a court building for challenging the order of a judge. Confessions made by some detainees, like lawyer Xie Yang, reflect the pressures on them, supporters say Jerome Cohen is a professor at New York University School of Law and a long-term expert on the Chinese legal system. He knows some of the detained lawyers personally. ""They are in the lead, they are the ones who have really gone public. There are many other lawyers who are quietly working, they hope, within the limits allowed by the party,"" he said. ""But they too are feeling the pressure and are watching very carefully how these lawyers, who were up front as it were, are being abused."" ""Of course this deters a lot of people, which is the whole aim of the party... to try to keep the lawyers in line."" President Xi Jinping has spoken of the dangers that liberal ideals, like constitutional rights enforceable in the courts, pose for Communist Party rule. China, it seems, wants lawyers to help it ""rule by law"", not keep its rulers in check through the ""rule of law"". The lawyers whose cases have gone to trial appear to be those who have consistently taken on the most politically sensitive cases, as well as those who have advocated for the need for a justice system beyond party control. ""The party knows it needs lawyers, it wants them for economic development,"" Mr Cohen said. ""But essentially, the party would like lawyers to behave like dentists, like technicians."" ""I admire dentists very much but I don't expect them to annunciate the values of my society,"" he added. ""So this is what the party is trying to do, and it is doing so with extreme cruelty."" Xi Jinping has said that liberal ideals threaten the Communist Party's monopoly on power But if that is the plan then, on one level, it isn't working. The ""war on law"" has prompted the wives of the detained lawyers to work together and advocate very publicly for their husbands' release. Despite facing continuing intimidation and harassment by plain-clothes policemen, they have refused to be silenced. Some of them evenaddressed a US Congressional hearing on the issue this week,external, including - via recorded video evidence - Li Wenzu. Other Chinese lawyers have come to the defence of those caught up in the crackdown, visiting detention centres to demand information or mounting legal challenges, only then, subsequently,to be detained themselves,external. And the wider community of Chinese defence lawyershas made public,externalits opposition to the alleged mistreatment of members of the profession. Meanwhile there is mounting concern about the fate of Wang Quanzhang. If he really is still holding out against the odds, his loved ones fear the consequences. Lawyer and friend Ge Wenxiu recorded this video message that wasposted on Twitter,externalthis week. ""Lawyer Quanzhang, are you still alive?"" he asks. ""We don't mind if you make a damn confession on Chinese TV and come home. Come home.""

"David Moyes took over last July but could not keep Sunderland in the Premier League Sunderland manager David Moyes has resigned following the club's relegation from the Premier League. The end of the Black Cats' 10-year stay in the top flight was confirmed when theylost to Bournemouth last month. Moyes, 54, informed chairman Ellis Short of his decision to step down at a meeting in London on Monday. ""I wish the players and my successor well in their efforts towards promotion back to the Premier League,"" said Moyes. Former Everton and Manchester United boss Moyestook charge in July last year,after Sam Allardyce left to become England manager. Sunderland finished bottom of the table this season with 24 points, having won only six games. ""I pursued the services of David Moyes for a considerable period prior to his appointment last summer, which makes the announcement of his departure difficult for everyone concerned,"" said owner Short. He said that Moyes was not taking compensation for his departure, calling it a ""testament to his character"". ""In the days ahead we will take some time for reflection, and then focus on recruitment and pre-season as we prepare for our Championship campaign. We wish David well in the future,"" added Short. The Scot hadfaced calls from Sunderland fans to quitand initially said it was""too soon"" to commit to the clubfollowing relegation. However, earlier this month hesuggested he would stay with the clubin the Championship next season, saying: ""I know what needs to be done to get back in the Premier League."" This video can not be played Chelsea worthy champions - Moyes In a club statement on Monday, Moyes said: ""I would like to thank Ellis Short and the Board for giving me the opportunity to manage Sunderland and the fans for always being so passionately supportive of their club."" This is the first time Moyes has been relegated as a manager, having warned supporters just two games into the season thathis squad would struggle. BBC Sport chief football writer Phil McNulty David Moyes' departure from Sunderland after a desperate season ended in relegation carried an air of inevitability  - and it is only a minor blessing for the Black Cats that the decision has been taken so quickly after its conclusion. It is a sign of how his stock has fallen that since he was awarded a six-year contract to succeed Sir Alex Ferguson at Manchester United in 2013 he has beensacked at Old Trafford,again at Spanish sideReal Sociedadand now has a relegation and resignation on his CV at Sunderland. And there are still two years left on that original Manchester United contract. Moyes looked a solid appointment in succession to Sam Allardyce but set the negative tone he adopted for the entire campaign when he flagged up a relegation fight after only two games. Sunderland's football was drab and draped in defeat. The only shining lights were leading scorer Jermain Defoe and promising young goalkeeper Jordan Pickford - who now look certain to follow Moyes out of the door. Moyes made some defiant noises about taking charge of Sunderland in the Championship but in the end his unpopularity with fans who had suffered all season, plus the embarrassment of relegation, left him with nowhere to go but away from Wearside.

"Kumar Sangakkara is the second highest ODI run-scorer with 14,234 Former Sri Lanka captain Kumar Sangakkara says he will retire from first-class cricket after this season. The 39-year-old Surrey batsman, who quit Test cricket in 2015, is fifth in the list of all-time Test run scorers. ""You try to fight the inevitable but you need to get out while you're ahead,"" he told BBC Sport. ""It's the last time I'll play a four-day game here [at Lord's]. I'll be 40 in a few months, this is about the end of my time in county cricket."" Sangakkara has contracts to honour in Twenty20 competitions taking him into 2018, but added: ""My career might have a few more months [left] but that's about it."" He averaged more than 57 runs across 134 Tests, making 11 double centuries in that time, and joined Surrey for the 2015 season. He scored more than 1,000 first-class runs last season but, despitehitting two centuries against Middlesexover the weekend, Sangakkara believes September is the right time to end his career in the longer format. ""The biggest mistake that sometimes you can make is that you think you're better than you really are,"" he said. ""Cricketers, or any sort of sportsperson, have an expiry date and you need to walk away. ""I have been very lucky to play for as long as I did so but there's a lot more life to be lived away from the game."" Sangakkara poses next to his portrait at the home of cricket Few players will have signed off their last first-class match at Lord's in as much style as Sangakkara. Alongside two match-saving centuries, the former Durham and Warwickshire player also passed 20,000 first-class runs. Those feats coincided with him having his portrait - which hangs beside those of fellow Sri Lanka greats Mahela Jayawardene and Muttiah Muralitharan - unveiled in the Lord's pavilion. ""It was a great privilege and an honour. I think the artist has made me look better than I actually am,"" he joked. ""I sat here in my last Test at Lord's for Sri Lanka thinking 'I hope I get a hundred, but wouldn't it be funny if I get out for a duck'. ""You never think of [scoring a] hundred. You think 'I want to get a hundred', but then you just try and do your processes, you try and get through tough periods, and bat as the game develops. ""I wasn't aware I'd reached 20,000 [first-class] runs - I only really know how many Test and One-Day International runs I've scored - but it was really nice to find out that I passed [that milestone]. Sangakkara is one of only two players to have won Wisden Leading Cricketer in the World on two occasions Sangakkara will head to the Caribbean Premier League at the end of June, withAaron Finch signed by Surreyas his replacement during that period, and he says he will continue to play cricket past the end of the English domestic season. But after more than 19 years of playing the professional game, the opportunity to watch the great batsman play his trademark cover drive is coming to an end. Asked if he would play T20 cricket after his summer, he replied: ""Yes, I think the mercenary in me is still alive. ""I've got a couple of contracts I have to honour this year and one at the start of the next year,"" he said. ""No-one wants an old dog just playing for the sake of playing. ""I think it's a good thing that all these [Twenty20] competitions push you to perform. That's the incentive because otherwise, if you're going to be a part of a side just to be the benchmark name, that's a bit disappointing.

"Follow live radio and text commentary of Ajax v Manchester United in the Europa League final on 5 live, the BBC Sport website and mobile app Europa League final - Manchester United v Ajax Venue:Friends Arena, StockholmDate:Wednesday 24 MayTime:19:45 BST Coverage:Follow live radio and text commentary on BBC Radio 5 live, the BBC Sport website and mobile app A senior Manchester police chief says it would be ""naive"" to think Wednesday's Europa League final in Stockholm will be trouble free. Riot police needed to interveneto keep Manchester United and Ajax fans apart when they met in Amsterdam in 2012. Ticketless fans are expected in Sweden, having missed out on both club's official allocations of 9,500. ""You would be naive to think you are not going to get anything,"" said chief superintendent John O'Hare. ""It is a final, in Europe, between two really big, established, well-supported teams. There will always be a minority of individuals who want to use this as cover to cause trouble,"" the Greater Manchester Police officer added. O'Hare and a small team of officers who specialise in monitoring United games will be in the Swedish capital to work with Swedish and Dutch counterparts. They will also liaise with Europe's governing body Uefa and the clubs themselves in an effort to ensure the game passes off without incident. He is encouraged by the knowledge Swedish police are likely to adopt an ""engaging, front-facing"" approach, which he feels will help avoid the kinds of scenes witnessed in Madrid last month when Spanish police clashed with Leicester City supporters ahead of their side's Champions League quarter-final with Atletico Madrid. On that occasion, Madrid police were criticised for their approach asseveral fans were hurt. O'Hare said: ""English football fans have a certain way of behaving, which we understand as being jubilant and non-threatening. ""It is about making sure the Swedish police understand the context and only employ the tactics that are appropriate at that moment in time. ""Often in Manchester we have found you get more response by talking to people than coming at them with batons. ""That is not the way we do business and we will try our very best to ensure that is not the way they do business over in Stockholm."" O'Hare also confirmed there would be a significant police presence in Manchester city centre on Wednesday night. United are looking to win the Europa League for the first time and join Ajax as one of only five teams to have won all three major European competitions.

"This video can not be played IPL makes you a better player - Stokes England v South Africa: First one-day international Venue:Headingley, LeedsDate:Wednesday 24 MayTime:14:00 BST Coverage:Ball-by-ball Test Match Special commentary on BBC Radio 5 live sports extra; in-play highlights and text commentary on the BBC Sport website and app. All-rounder Ben Stokes would like to see more of his England team-mates join him in the Indian Premier League. Stokes became the IPL's most expensive foreigner when he was signed byRising Pune Supergiant for Â£1.7m,and went on to win the most valuable player award. He helped his side to second in the group stages before returning to England duty, while Pune went onto lose the 2017 final by one run. ""Everyone who goes there becomes a better player,"" said Stokes. The 25-year-old scored 316 runs at a strike rate of 142.98 and took 12 wickets at an economy rate of 7.18 in the Twenty20 competition. ""It would be great in the future if maybe the whole England team could be out there,"" said Stokes,who scored his maiden Twenty20 centurywhile in India. ""It's not just the fact of playing in the tournament, it's the exposure you get as a player. ""Playing in high pressure situations against all the best players in the world at what they do - guys bowling at 150kph [93mph] and guys knocking it out of the park if you do not hit the areas you want to bowl."" Stokes played in the same team as former India captain MS Dhoni and current Australia skipper Steve Smith, with the latter praising the all-rounder during the tournament. ""To be part of a competition like that was an amazing experience - the biggest Twenty20 competition in world cricket  - [as was] being able to share a changing room with the greatest players in the world, the greats of the game of cricket,"" said Stokes. ""I didn't go into the tournament worrying about [the fee]. The biggest thing for me was making sure I left a good impression with my performances on the field. ""That's what we pride ourselves on as cricketers. All the pressure I put on myself was wanting to perform on the pitch."" Jos Buttler has played for Mumbai Indians for two consecutive IPL tournaments Eight England players were bought by IPL franchises this year, with Stokes, wicketkeeper Jos Buttler and bowler Chris Woakes given permission to remain in India and miss England's ODI series against Ireland in May. Buttler said English cricket was now embracing the IPL and other domestic Twenty20 tournaments as part of an increased focus on white ball cricket. ""I think the IPL has been a bit of a taboo subject in English cricket for a while,"" he told BBC Radio 5 live's Tuffers and Vaughan show. ""It's [been] tried to make it unattractive to go to [in the past] but now the focus has shifted and people are embracing it. ""It's a shame it didn't happen before but it's better late than never. These tournaments are fantastic for cricket and the audiences."" England play South Africa in three one-day internationals, starting on Wednesday, before hosting the Champions Trophy, and Stokes says England have ""earned the right to be favourites"". ""We are just going to try to do what we have been doing over that last two years which is to go out there and perform to the best of our capabilities and always want to be on the front foot,"" he added. ""We've always known that we are a destructive outfit so when other opponents are saying that they don't like bowling at Jos [Buttler], for instance, at the end, you know what they are going through at the end of the mat."" Looking forward to the upcoming ODI series, he added: ""South Africa are one of the best teams in the world. They have got some of the best players in the world as well so it's a good opportunity to get into some form leading into the Champions Trophy.""

"""Chelsea - Premier League thoroughbreds and deserved champions"" Phil McNulty's predicted 2016-17 Premier League positions at a glance Position Club Position (cont) Club (cont) 1 Manchester City 11 Crystal Palace 2 Manchester United 12 Southampton 3 Chelsea 13 Sunderland 4 Arsenal 14 West Bromwich Albion 5 Tottenham 15 Swansea City 6 Liverpool 16 Bournemouth 7 West Ham 17 Middlesbrough 8 Leicester City 18 Watford 9 Everton 19 Burnley 10 Stoke City 20 Hull Chelsea captain John Terry said farewell during Chelsea's final game of the season on Sunday Premier League thoroughbreds and deserved champions. Brilliantly managed by Antonio Conte in his first season at the club - addressed early failings with tactical acumen, repaired a broken squad and got Chelsea's best players playing again. McNulty's pre-season prediction:3rd What he said:""This squad and team is so much better than it showed last season. Expect Conte, who will not suffer fools or any political manoeuvring in the dressing room, to flourish."" Managerial mark:Antonio Conte - 9/10 Stat:Chelsea are the first side to win 30 games in a single Premier League season. Read more:How Conte turned Chelsea into champions Manager of the year Antonio Conte (Chelsea) Came into a Premier League boasting the likes of Pep Guardiola, Jurgen Klopp and Jose Mourinho and outflanked them all. Made a very difficult job look very easy. Player of the year N'Golo Kante (Chelsea) A humble, modest character who does his job in a humble, modest way. And does it quite brilliantly. Harry Kane (right) scored a hat-trick as Tottenham thrashed Championship-bound Hull City 7-1 on Sunday Nearly, but not quite after another season of progress for Mauricio Pochettino's emerging young team. Spurs have an outstanding core of young, English players. If they can keep them together, add to the squad, and find a way to winat Wembleythen a trophy will surely come soon. But they now need to win something. McNulty's pre-season prediction:5th What he said:""Tough call this one as Pochettino's side were excellent last season and were right in the title shake-up for so long. In reality, you could throw a blanket over the likes of Chelsea, Spurs, Liverpool and Arsenal in the battle for top-four places."" Managerial mark:Mauricio Pochettino - 7/10. Stat:Tottenham scored more goals and conceded fewer than any other team in the Premier League, beating champions Chelsea's goal difference by eight. 'Let's make this house a home' award West Ham United and Tottenham (joint) The Hammers try to recreate the hostility and atmospherics of Upton Park at the sprawling London Stadium and Spurs try to find a way to win at Wembley - their new home next season and where they have lost seven times and won only once in their past nine appearances. ""I was so happy with this season. We fought in all competitions and the only regret is that we did not fight until the end"" - Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola No escaping the tinge of disappointment to Pep Guardiola's first season at Manchester City. No trophies, out in the last 16 of the Champions League, and top four in the Premier League was the minimum requirement. Not found it as easy a transition as at Barcelona and Bayern Munich. Defensive and goalkeeping flaws to fix but Gabriel Jesus could be a superstar next season. McNulty's pre-season prediction:1st What he said:""Now City have signed John Stones, responsibility will lie with him for curing defensive ills caused by poor form of Eliaquim Mangala and Nicolas Otamendi, as well as captain Vincent Kompany's injuries. I'm backing a Guardiola-inspired City to reclaim the title."" Managerial mark:Pep Guardiola - 6/10. Stat:Manchester City have finished in the top four for seven successive seasons, the longest active streak of any club in the Premier League after Arsenal's failure this season. Liverpool secured their Champions League return with a 3-0 win over Middlesbrough The return of Champions League football means Liverpool can count this season as progress and success - although manager Jurgen Klopp should not escape criticism for tame exits to Southampton in the Capital One Cup semi-final and at home to Championship strugglers Wolves with a weakened side in the FA Cup. Not as sparkling in the second half of the season and no trophies, but a sense of a club going in the right direction. McNulty's pre-season prediction:6th What he said:""The biggest plus will be that Klopp now has the squad he wants. First title since 1990? No - but a good bet for a cup."" Managerial mark:Jurgen Klopp - 7/10. Stat:Liverpool have finished in the top four of the Premier League for only the second time in the past eight seasons. ""I am professional. I love this club enough to do my best every single day"" - Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger Arsene Wenger's toughest season at Arsenal. Plenty of supporter unrest - and most significantly no Champions League football for the first time in 20 years. Seismic moment for the club after a poor season.Even if Wenger stays,something has to change - and that applies even if Arsenal win the FA Cup. McNulty's pre-season prediction:4th What he said:""Fourth-place prediction... but with doubts and with fingers crossed."" Managerial mark:Arsene Wenger - 5/10 Stat:Arsenal have finished the season outside of the top four for the first time since the 1995-96 campaign, when they finished fifth under Bruce Rioch. Paul Pogba netted his first Premier League goal since December during Manchester United's 2-0 win over Crystal Palace on Sunday Stodgy first season for Jose Mourinho at Old Trafford - but still the possibility of it being rated a real success if theywin the Europa Leagueand secure Champions League football on top of winning the EFL Cup. Too many draws at Old Trafford and too many cautious away displays at close rivals. Still very much a Mourinho work in progress and league form must improve next season. McNulty's pre-season prediction:2nd What he said:""Where will Wayne Rooney fit into Mourinho's grand plan? And what about United's defence? How will Â£30m Eric Bailly from Villarreal adapt to the Premier League? Despite this, expect United to be back in the title shake-up."" Managerial mark:Jose Mourinho - 6/10. Stat:Manchester United never finished lower than third in the Premier League under Sir Alex Ferguson, but have now ended seventh, fourth, fifth and sixth in the past four seasons. Ross Barkley was dropped from Everton's starting line-up on Sunday Genuine season of progress under manager Ronald Koeman - European football is back at Everton and Goodison Park is a fortress once more. Doubts must be resolved over the future of Romelu Lukaku and Ross Barkley but talk of high ambition in the transfer market this summer is more cause for optimism. McNulty's pre-season prediction:9th What he said:""Koeman is a shrewd and ruthless operator. It should also be remembered he inherited a debacle from predecessor Roberto Martinez."" Managerial mark:Ronald Koeman - 7/10. Stat:Everton won 43 points at Goodison Park in the Premier League this season, their most in a top-flight campaign at home since 1989-90 (45). One for the future Tom Davies (Everton) Everton's teenage midfielder has that stamp of class and his goal against Manchester City was one of the highlights of the season at Goodison Park. ""Sometimes there is disappointment because often there was good football without reward. I am satisfied for all this season"" - Claude Puel Solid if unspectacular from the Saints, although deservedly reached Wembley and were on the rough end of poor decisions when losing to Manchester United in the EFL Cup final. Manager Claude Puel was a low-key figure and occasionally unconvincing but forward Manolo Gabbiadini looks a good signing. Can they keep defender Virgil van Dijk? And will Puel even stay? Can they realistically expect to be doing better? McNulty's pre-season prediction:12th What he said:""Expect another solid season but not another top six."" Managerial mark:Claude Puel - 6/10 Stat:Southampton have the second-youngest starting XIs in the league behind Tottenham, with an average of 26 years 169 days old Joshua King top scored with 16 goals for Bournemouth Another excellent season under manager Eddie Howe. This is dreamland for the Cherries - not just in the Premier League but stabilised in it by playing attractive, attacking football. An outstanding achievement by Bournemouth. McNulty's pre-season prediction:16th What he said:""The reality is that Premier League status is success in itself for Bournemouth."" Managerial mark:Eddie Howe - 7/10 Stat:Eleven different English players have made 20 or more Premier League appearances for Bournemouth this season. The last Premier League team to do this were Aston Villa in 2000-01. ""I'm more concerned about making clubs better, wherever you finish. We've done better than what we did the previous year"" - Tony Pulis The Baggies may have tailed off towards the end of the season but this was still a good term with underrated manager Tony Pulis at the helm. Consolidated in the Premier League - so will the new Chinese owners show ambition to try to break the glass ceiling? McNulty's pre-season prediction:14th What he said:""If stability and Premier League status is what is required then expect Pulis to deliver again, but there was not much to excite at The Hawthorns last season."" Managerial mark:Tony Pulis - 6/10 Stat:West Brom scored 48.8% of their goals from set-pieces this season, the highest proportion of any team in the Premier League. ""You need time. It is very hard to get that Upton Park feeling but it is going to get better and better"" - Slaven Bilic Poor first season at London Stadium. Doesn't feel like home after Upton Park but an even bigger problem has been those playing in it. Yes, manager Slaven Bilic's plans were derailed by forward Dimitri Payet downing tools but recruitment was desperately poor. Has to improve this summer. McNulty's pre-season prediction:7th What he said:""West Ham's biggest challenge may be settling into new surroundings at London Stadium. Yes, they will be watched by bigger crowds and the environment may be more luxurious, but Upton Park had an atmosphere that could win points."" Managerial mark:Slaven Bilic - 5/10 Stat:West Ham, along with Bournemouth, lost 22 points from winning positions, the highest total in the Premier League. Goal of the season Andy Carroll (West Ham) Contenders were Emre Can's overhead kick for Liverpool at Watford and 'scorpion' kicks from Henrikh Mkhitaryan against Sunderland and Olivier Giroud against Crystal Palace. All worthy winners, but I'll go for Andy Carroll's spectacular bicycle kick for West Ham against Palace at London Stadium. Craig Shakespeare took over from Claudio Ranieri in February What a two-faced season for last season's champions - so poor underClaudio Ranieri that he was sackedjust nine months after leading them to the title. But the Foxes were the Premier League's last men standing in the Champions League before losing to Atletico Madrid in the quarter-final. Transformed under Craig Shakespeare - but where exactly were these players for six months of the season? McNulty's pre-season prediction:8th What he said:""I do not expect another run at the Premier League but there is good reason to believe momentum and confidence gained from one of the greatest sporting stories ever told will lead to another very good campaign."" Managerial mark:Claudio Ranieri - 5/10; Craig Shakespeare - 7/10 Stat:Leicester completed 70.1% of passes, only Burnley managed less. The 'where were you for six months?' award Leicester City's players For suddenly looking like the team that won the Premier League the moment title-winning manager Claudio Ranieri was sacked. ""We will be better next year. It's not going to be revolution but evolution for us"" - Stoke manager Mark Hughes Disappointing season for Stoke City - one where the reign of manager Mark Hughes has marked time, and in a league placing context, gone backwards after top-10 finishes. Needs a good summer in the transfer market. McNulty's pre-season prediction:10th What he said:""Mark Hughes has built on the work of Tony Pulis to make the Potters genuine top-10 material and it should be no different this time around."" Managerial mark:Mark Hughes - 5/10 Stat:Stoke won only three points from losing positions this season Sam Allardyce took over from Alan Pardew as Palace manager in December 2016 Sam Allardyce did what he does best -recovering from his humbling exit as England managerafter only 67 days and one game to guide Crystal Palace to safety after taking over from the sacked Alan Pardew with the Eagles 17th, one point above the relegation zone and with only one win in 11 games. He took a while to get going but big wins at Chelsea and Liverpool and at home to Arsenal showed 'Big Sam' still had the touch. McNulty's pre-season prediction:11th What he said:""Do not expect any relegation fears but a comfortable mid-table finish."" Managerial mark:Alan Pardew - 3/10; Sam Allardyce - 7/10 Stat:Crystal Palace took just six points from eight London derbies this season Paul Clement took over as Swansea manager in January Three managers in one season is a recipe for trouble but it was third time lucky as the calm approach ofPaul Clementguided them to safety with a game to spare after Francesco Guidolin's struggles and Bob Bradley's 85-day reign. A season full of anxiety, though, and leaned heavily on the goals and guile of two players who will be in demand this summer - striker Fernando Llorente and playmaker Gylfi Sigurdsson. McNulty's pre-season prediction:15th What he said:""Expect a solid, if unspectacular, season."" Managerial mark:Francesco Guidolin - 4/10; Bob Bradley - 3/10; Paul Clement - 7/10 Stat:Swansea conceded 70 goals. Only two teams have conceded more in a 38-game Premier League season and survived relegation - Wigan in 2009-10 (79) and West Brom in 2010-11 (71). ""We have got better year on year, that is not just the players it is the staff"" - Burnley manager Sean Dyche Burnley's success is staying up and it has been job done for manager Sean Dyche. He was worked his resources superbly and a formidable home record - not to mention some real talent such as keeper Tom Heaton and defender Michael Keane - have been at the heart of their survival. McNulty's pre-season prediction:19th What he said:""It will be a long hard season but perhaps, helped by the atmospheric surroundings of Turf Moor and the excellence of Dyche, Burnley can make this forecast go astray."" Managerial mark:Sean Dyche - 7/10 Stat:Burnley beat Liverpool in August despite having only 19.6% of possession, the lowest by a winning side in the Premier League since 2006-07. Watford's next manager will be their ninth in five years and the eighth since the Pozzo family took charge in 2012 Another season. Another one-season manager in thedeparting Walter Mazzarri.Another Premier League survival. Not everybody's model of how to run a football club but it keeps Watford up and that is what matters. How long will it work? McNulty's pre-season prediction:18th What he said:""It will be a dogfight near the bottom. Can the Hornets survive? I'm not sure they can."" Managerial mark:Walter Mazzarri - 6/10 Stat:Jose Holebas was shown 14 yellow cards, equalling the Premier League record for a player in a single campaign. Manager Marco Silva on his Hull City future: ""It is a difficult decision. I have something in my mind and need to see what is best for me as well as the club."" Doomed from the start as manager Mike Phelan was operating with barely a squad and his hands tied. Marco Silva's arrival galvanised the Tigers but he could not replicate excellent home form on Hull City's travels. So it is back to the Championship - in all probability without their excellent manager. McNulty's pre-season prediction:20th What he said:""Long, hard season ahead and the signs do not look good."" Managerial mark:Mike Phelan - 4/10; Marco Silva - 6/10 Stat:Because of their opening-day victory against Leicester City, Hull City spent one more day on top of the Premier League than Tottenham Hotspur did in 2016-17 (0). Middlesbrough sacked Aitor Karanka in March Middlesbrough simply came and went without contributing much to the Premier League - not bold enough, not enough goals. It is a shame and they may well wonder if they could have had more of a go. Plus points? Squad looks in decent shape to come straight back up and they still have chairman Steve Gibson. McNulty's pre-season prediction:17th What he said:""This season is about consolidation."" Managerial mark:Aitor Karanka- 5/10; Steve Agnew - 4/10 Stat:Middlesbrough were 14th in the Premier League on Christmas Day, but were the 12th side to be that high in the Premier League table on 25 December and still be relegated that season. David Moyes signed a four-year deal when he joined Sunderland last summer Sunderland and manager David Moyes got exactly what they deserved after an appalling season. Moyes killed any optimism by announcing the Black Cats would be in a relegation fight after only his second game - one of the few things the beleaguered Scot got right this season. Will now lose best playersJordan Pickfordand Jermain Defoe and no-one would be confident about them coming back up from the Championship. McNulty's pre-season prediction:13th What he said:""Moyes will have the Black Cats well-drilled and hard to beat."" Managerial mark:David Moyes - 3/10 Stat:Jermain Defoe scored 15 goals for Sunderland, 51.7% of their team total. Thankless task award Jordan Pickford (Sunderland) Made himself a hero behind the Premier League's worst team. He will get a big summer move out of it and is an England keeper of the future. Flop of the season David Moyes (Sunderland) He now has sackings at Manchester United and Real Sociedad on his CV and a relegation with Sunderland. Can he ever turn that decline around?

"Stan Kroenke has a 67% stake in Arsenal Arsenal majority shareholder Stan Kroenke says his shares ""are not, and have never been, for sale"". The American's company released a statement on Monday followingthe recent Â£1bn bidby Alisher Usmanov to take full control of the Gunners. Kroenke Sports and Entertainment added it was ""a committed, long-term investor in Arsenal and will remain so"". The statement comes a day after Arsenal failed to qualify for the Champions League for the first time in 20 years. Kroenke has a 67% stake in Arsenal. Usmanov owns 30% but is not part of the board or decision-making at the club. The Uzbek-born Russiansaid in April,externalthat Kroenke must ""bear huge responsibility"" for the club's failures on the pitch. Read more:Wenger admits uncertainty over his future affected Arsenal Metal magnate Alisher Usmanov owns 30% of Arsenal shares The Gunners, who finished fifth in the Premier League this season, face Chelsea in the FA Cup final on Saturday. Arsenal legend Ian Wright says the club needs the spending power of a billionaire such as Usmanov, adding ""something has to change"". Listen:Wright 'delighted' with Arsenal fans no-show Download BBC Radio 5 live's Football Daily podcast The statement from Kroenke did not mention the future of Gunners boss Arsene Wenger, whose contract expires in the summer. Wenger, who has been the target of protests from some of the club's fans, says the situation will be decided after the FA Cup final. However, he blamed the uncertainty over his future for contributing to the club failing to qualify for the Champions League. Chelsea have won 14 major trophies since Roman Abramovich (second right) took control The Gunners' London rivals Chelsea won the Premier League this season - the fifth time they have done so under the ownership of billionaire Roman Abramovich, who has spent heavily since taking control in 2003. ""Abramovich is a winner,"" added Wright, who scored 185 goals in 288 appearances for Arsenal. ""Stan Kroenke sees it as another asset. If you look at all his other franchises, they are doing the same. They are mediocre, with poor attendances and aren't achieving anything as a team. That is where Arsenal are at the moment. ""We need an owner like Abramovich, who wants to win. I would swap Arsenal's last 10 years for what Chelsea have done.""

"Signs reading ""No more dictatorship"" are a common sight at anti-government protests ""Venezuela is now a dictatorship,"" says Luis Ugalde, a Spanish-born Jesuit priest who during his 60 years living in Venezuela has become one of the South American nation's most well-known political scientists. A former rector of the Andres Bello Catholic University in Caracas, Mr Ugalde does not mince his words. He compares Venezuela to an ailing patient who is on the brink of being killed off by well-meaning but incompetent doctors. Venezuela's problems are not new, he says. At their heart is the mistaken belief that it is a rich country. He argues that while it may have the world's largest proven oil reserves, Venezuela should be considered overwhelmingly poor because it hardly produces anything except oil. A lack of investment in anything but the booming oil industry in the 20th Century meant that its human talent was never really fostered and its economy never diversified, resulting in an absolute reliance on imports. Venezuela's late leader, Hugo ChÃ¡vez, further compounded the illusion of Venezuela's wealth to the detriment of the country, Mr Ugalde argues. While oil prices were high, Hugo Chavez could afford to fund social programmes ""He told the Venezuelan people that there were three things standing between them and prosperity: the US empire, the rich and the entrenched political elite, and that he would deal with all three so that the people could enjoy Venezuela's wealth."" Investing Venezuela's oil revenue in generous social programmes, building homes and health care centres, expanding educational opportunities and providing the poorest with benefits they did not previously have, gave the government of President Chavez a wide support base. But with falling global oil prices, government coffers soon emptied and investment in social programmes dwindled. The death from cancer of President ChÃ¡vez in 2013 further hit the governing socialist PSUV party hard. His successor in office, Nicolas Maduro, lacked not only the charisma of President ChÃ¡vez but also his unifying presence at the top of the party and the country. Mr Ugalde does not doubt that President Maduro came to power democratically in 2013. Luis Ugalde says that Venezuela has become a dictatorship But he argues that what he has done since - such as undermining Venezuela's separation of powers - has turned him into a dictator. The Democratic Unity Roundtable opposition coalition won a landslide in the December 2015 election and yet it has seen almost all of its decisions overturned by the Supreme Court, a body which opposition politicians say is stacked with government loyalists. An attempt by opposition politicians to organise a recall referendum to oust President Maduro from power was thwarted at every step by Venezuela's electoral council, another body opposition politicians say is dominated by supporters of Mr Maduro. But for many the final straw came on 29 March 2017, when Supreme Court judges issued a ruling stripping the National Assembly of its powers and transferring those powers to the court. The opposition-controlled National Assembly is overlooked by a poster of Hugo ChÃ¡vez While the Supreme Court suspended the most controversial paragraphs just three days later, the ruling managed to unite the hitherto divided opposition and spur them into action. There have been almost daily protests and more than 45 people have been killed in protest-related violence. Inside Venezuela's anti-government protests 'I begged my son not to go and protest' What's behind the turmoil? While many of those protesting against the government share Mr Ugalde's view, the government is adamant it is defending democracy in Venezuela. It argues that the National Assembly was in contempt when it swore in three lawmakers suspected of having been elected fraudulently and that all of the decisions made by the legislative body since then are therefore invalid. The government has responded to the most recent wave of protests by calling for a constituent assembly. Drawing up a new constitution will bring together the people of Venezuela and create peace where there is now unrest, President Maduro argues. He also says he wants to enshrine some of the social programmes created by the socialist government in the new constitution. At a pro-government rally, a sergeant in the National Bolivarian Militia, a body created by the late President Hugo Chavez, says he whole-heartedly backs the idea. Gerardo Barahona says he supports President Maduro's plans for a constituent assembly ""We're against terrorism, those people protesting violently who're burning buses, we support the constituent assembly,"" Gerardo Barahona says. Marta Elena Flores, 60, says the opposition is ""out to wreck everything"" achieved under the socialist government. ""We need to protect all the benefits the government has given to the people,"" she says. ""We need to enshrine them in the constitution so that the opposition doesn't even have the chance to rob us of them."" Marta Elena Flores says the government's social programmes have made a difference to her life ""I personally have been able to have two operations thanks to the government's medical programmes. The opposition begrudges us those benefits."" Opposition politicians have been dismissive of the president's call for a constituent assembly, saying it is a ruse to delay overdue regional elections and further strengthen the power of President Maduro. Representatives of the major opposition parties declined a government invitation to discuss the creation of the assembly and, three weeks after the idea was first mooted by President Maduro, little progress has been made. Government critics say the constituent assembly is ""a fraud"" Previous attempts at dialogue backed by former international leaders and even the Vatican have failed. Anti-government marches meanwhile have been spreading throughout the country and clashes between protesters and the security forces have become more frequent and the number of dead has been on the rise. Those opposed to the government say they are determined to keep the protests going until fresh general elections are called and the government is ousted. Protest in pictures Some analysts have said that what it will take for the government to fall is for the protests to spread to the ""barrios"", the poor neighbourhoods which have been the support base of the governing socialist party. Miguel Pizarro, an opposition lawmaker who represents the barrio of Petare, one of the poorest in Caracas, dismisses that argument. Miguel Pizarro is proud to represent Petare ""The only contact people who make that argument have with the barrio is through their cleaning lady,"" he says. ""There has been resistance to the government in the barrios for a long time, that is how I got elected!"" Others think that it will take the military to switch sides for the government to be ousted. But with Defence Minister Vladimir Padrinotaking to Twitter on 20 May,externalto accuse protesters of fomenting anarchy and international organisations of being ""immoral accomplices who don't denounce the violence"" there is little sign of that happening any time soon, at least within the highest ranks. In the short term at least, there seems little chance of the current deadlock in Venezuela being broken and every likelihood that the crisis will worsen.

"Wang Quanzhang was detained in August 2015 - and hasn't been seen or heard from since In August 2015 Wang Quanzhang was detained by the Chinese authorities. In that he was not alone. The nationwide series of raids that summer saw more than 200 lawyers, legal assistants and human rights activists brought in for questioning. But almost two years on, Mr Wang is the only lawyer from whom nothing has been heard at all. ""I don't know whether he's alive or dead,"" his wife Li Wenzu told me. ""I have had no information at all. He has simply disappeared from the face of the earth. It is so scary, so brutal."" China's ""709"" crackdown as it's now known - a reference to 9 July, the date it began - is widely seen as a sign of a growing intolerance of dissent under President Xi Jinping. This video can not be played Li Wenzu has not heard from her husband Wang Quanzhang since 2015 Of the large number of people initially detained, around two dozen have been pursued as formal investigations. Over the past year or so those cases have gradually been reaching some kind of a conclusion. Some ofthe accused have been given long jail terms, of up to seven and a half years, for the crime of subversion. Others have beengiven suspended prison sentencesor released on bail, but remain under constant surveillance. But of the lawyers arrested in that initial 2015 sweep, Mr Wang is unique. Apart from one brief written notification of his arrest, the family say he has disappeared into a black hole. Li Wenzu fears her husband is being punished for a failure to compromise ""For these two years, he hasn't been allowed to meet the lawyer that we have employed for him, and he has no right to communicate with the outside world,"" his wife Ms Li said. ""He has been deprived of all rights."" There have been allegations thatsome of the lawyers have been torturedduring their detention, force-fed drugs, shackled, beaten and kept in stress positions for long periods of time. Theiradmissions of guilt, either in court or in the televised confessions that have been broadcast by state-run TV, should not be taken at face value, their supporters argue, but rather as the inevitable consequence of the pressure they've been under. They now fear that Mr Wang's continued incarceration might be because he is holding out. ""I think it might be because my husband hasn't compromised at all,"" Ms Li said. ""That's why his case remains unsolved."" Wang Quanzhang is certainly no stranger to pressure. His work representing the persecuted followers of China's banned spiritual movement, Falun Gong, as well as human rights activists, has attracted the ire of the authorities before. Inthis interview,external, he recounts being beaten in the basement of a court building for challenging the order of a judge. Confessions made by some detainees, like lawyer Xie Yang, reflect the pressures on them, supporters say Jerome Cohen is a professor at New York University School of Law and a long-term expert on the Chinese legal system. He knows some of the detained lawyers personally. ""They are in the lead, they are the ones who have really gone public. There are many other lawyers who are quietly working, they hope, within the limits allowed by the party,"" he said. ""But they too are feeling the pressure and are watching very carefully how these lawyers, who were up front as it were, are being abused."" ""Of course this deters a lot of people, which is the whole aim of the party... to try to keep the lawyers in line."" President Xi Jinping has spoken of the dangers that liberal ideals, like constitutional rights enforceable in the courts, pose for Communist Party rule. China, it seems, wants lawyers to help it ""rule by law"", not keep its rulers in check through the ""rule of law"". The lawyers whose cases have gone to trial appear to be those who have consistently taken on the most politically sensitive cases, as well as those who have advocated for the need for a justice system beyond party control. ""The party knows it needs lawyers, it wants them for economic development,"" Mr Cohen said. ""But essentially, the party would like lawyers to behave like dentists, like technicians."" ""I admire dentists very much but I don't expect them to annunciate the values of my society,"" he added. ""So this is what the party is trying to do, and it is doing so with extreme cruelty."" Xi Jinping has said that liberal ideals threaten the Communist Party's monopoly on power But if that is the plan then, on one level, it isn't working. The ""war on law"" has prompted the wives of the detained lawyers to work together and advocate very publicly for their husbands' release. Despite facing continuing intimidation and harassment by plain-clothes policemen, they have refused to be silenced. Some of them evenaddressed a US Congressional hearing on the issue this week,external, including - via recorded video evidence - Li Wenzu. Other Chinese lawyers have come to the defence of those caught up in the crackdown, visiting detention centres to demand information or mounting legal challenges, only then, subsequently,to be detained themselves,external. And the wider community of Chinese defence lawyershas made public,externalits opposition to the alleged mistreatment of members of the profession. Meanwhile there is mounting concern about the fate of Wang Quanzhang. If he really is still holding out against the odds, his loved ones fear the consequences. Lawyer and friend Ge Wenxiu recorded this video message that wasposted on Twitter,externalthis week. ""Lawyer Quanzhang, are you still alive?"" he asks. ""We don't mind if you make a damn confession on Chinese TV and come home. Come home.""
