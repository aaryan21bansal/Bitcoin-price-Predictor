"E. Jean Carroll - seen here at an event in 2015 - has made the allegation in an article US President Donald Trump has dismissed allegations that he raped a woman in a department store dressing room in the mid-1990s as ""fiction"". The US president says he never met E. Jean Carroll and accuses her of making up the allegation to sell a new book. Ms Carroll says she did not report the alleged attack at the time after being advised by a friend she had no chance of winning in court. Her story was published in New York magazine on Friday. More than a dozen women have previously made sexual misconduct allegations against Mr Trump, which he has denied. In the article,she describes meeting Mr Trump,externalin late 1995 or early 1996, in Bergdorf Goodman. She says she recognised him as the ""real estate tycoon"" and that he told her he was buying a present for ""a girl"". She says Mr Trump knew she was a TV agony aunt and the two joked around, encouraging each other to try on some lingerie. She alleges that they then went to a dressing room, where she accuses him of raping her. Both Mr Trump and Ms Carroll were aged around 50 at the time, and he was married to Marla Maples. Ms Carroll says she told two friends about the alleged incident, one of whom advised her to go to the police. But she says the other advised her against telling anyone saying: ""Forget it! He has 200 lawyers. He'll bury you."" The accusation is one of six alleged attacks by ""hideous men"" that Ms Carroll details in her article. Another alleged incident involves Les Moonves, the former CEO of CBS.He resigned in 2018 after allegations of sexual misconduct. Mr Moonves' representative told New York magazine he ""emphatically denies"" the incident. Ms Carroll ends the article by saying Mr Trump was her ""last hideous man"" and she has not had sex since then. ""I've never met this person in my life,"" the US president said in a statement. ""She is trying to sell a new book - that should indicate her motivation.  It should be sold in the fiction section."" However, the New York magazine article included an image of Mr Trump and Ms Carroll together at an NBC party around 1987. When he was asked about the photo on Saturday, Mr Trump said: ""Standing with my coat on in a line, give me a break, with my back to the camera. I have no idea who she is."" He added: ""There is some picture where we're shaking hands it looks like at some kind of event. I have my coat on, I have my wife standing next to me, and I didn't know her husband but he was a newscaster. But I have no idea who she is."" Mr Trump encouraged anyone with information that the Democratic Party is working with Ms Carroll or New York magazine to notify the White House. Mr Trump has described the allegations as ""a disgrace"" He accused the publication of ""peddling fake news"" and called the magazine a ""failing business."" ""Shame on those who make up false stories of assault to try to get publicity for themselves, or sell a book, or carry out a political agenda,"" he said. ""It's just as bad for people to believe it, particularly when there is zero evidence,"" he added. In his statement, Mr Trump thanked Bergdorf Goodman, the upmarket New York department store where the incident allegedly took place, for ""confirming they have no video footage of any such incident"".

"This video can not be played Trump: ""Let's make Iran great again"" The US will impose ""major"" additional sanctions on Iran in a bid to prevent the country obtaining nuclear weapons, President Donald Trump says. He said economic pressure would be maintained unless the leadership in Tehran changed course. ""We're putting additional sanctions on,"" he told reporters. ""In [some] cases we are moving rapidly."" It comes after Iran announced it would exceed internationally agreed limits on its nuclear programme. The limit on its stockpile of enriched uranium was set undera 2015 nuclear deal with world powers.In return, relevant sanctions were lifted, allowing Iran to resume oil exports - the government's main source of revenue. But the US pulled out of the deal last year and reinstated sanctions. This triggered an economic meltdown in Iran, pushing the value of its currency to record lows and driving away foreign investors. Iran nuclear crisis in 300 words US-Iran relations: A brief history How US sanctions have hit Iran Iran has responded by scaling back its commitments under the nuclear deal. ""If Iran wants to become a prosperous nation... it's OK with me,"" Mr Trump said.  ""But they're never going to do it if they think in five or six years they're going to have nuclear weapons."" ""Let's make Iran great again,"" he added, echoing his campaign slogan from the 2016 presidential election. In a later tweet,Mr Trump said the ""major additional sanctions"" would come into force on Monday.,external President Trump may have had second thoughts about carrying out a military strike against Iran, but he is set to toughen economic sanctions - the very policy that has helped bring the two countries to the brink of war. Iran's economy is suffering badly and it is threatening to breach some of the terms of the nuclear agreement it reached with the major powers. Mr Trump is also calling for negotiations with Iran. Earlier this month, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo offered talks with no conditions, save that Iran start behaving like ""a normal nation"". But Tehran dismissed this as ""wordplay"". Mr Trump's new sanctions will do nothing to reduce these tensions. A diplomatic ""off-ramp"" in this crisis seems as elusive as ever. The reinstatement of US sanctions last year - particularly those imposed on the energy, shipping and financial sectors - caused foreign investment to dry up and hit oil exports. The sanctions bar US companies from trading with Iran, but also with foreign firms or countries that are dealing with Iran.

Iran has responded to the economic pressure by violating some of the nuclear deal's commitments.It has also accused European countries of failing to live up to their promises of protecting Iran's economy from US sanctions. President Trump's announcement that additional sanctions will be imposed on Iran comes at a time of escalating tensions between the two countries. On Thursday, an unmanned US drone was shot down by Iranian forces in the Gulf. Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) said the drone's downing was a ""clear message"" to the US that Iran's borders were ""our red line"". But US military officials maintain the drone was in international airspace over the Strait of Hormuz at the time. Amir Ali Hajizadeh, a high-ranking officer in the IRGC, said another military aircraft, carrying 35 passengers, had been flying close to the drone. ""We could have shot down that one too, but we did not,"" he said. The shooting down of the drone followed accusations by the US that Iran had attacked two oil tankers with mines just outside the Strait of Hormuz.

"Boris Johnson, the UK's new prime minister, was already one of the UK's most recognisable politicians. His high profile - built up as an MP, London mayor and foreign secretary - has often seen his achievements accompanied by controversy. As editor of the Spectator magazine and a Have I Got News For You contestant, Boris Johnson was already well known for his shambolic persona. In 2001, he became an MP,replacing Michael Heseltine,externalin the safe Conservative seat of Henley-on-Thames. Gay rights He was considered more liberal than many Tories. As a journalist, he hadquestioned the repeal of laws banning the promotion of homosexuality by local authorities,external. But as an MP, he changed tack and said the state should not interfere in people's lives. He also voted in favour of civil partnerships. Boris Johnson during one of his Have I Got News For You appearances, in 2004 Mr Johnson continued to attract controversy. In October 2004, then Conservative leader Michael Howardordered him to visit Liverpool to apologise,externalfor a Spectator article accusing its residents of wallowing in ""disproportionate"" grief after Ken Bigley - an engineer from the city - was kidnapped and killed in Iraq. And the following month, he was sacked as shadow arts minister, amid claims he hadmisled Mr Howard about reports of an affair with Spectator columnist Petronella Wyatt.,external Political career 7 yearsMP for Henley (2001-2008) 8 yearsMayor of London (2008-2016) 4 yearsMP for Uxbridge and South Ruislip (2015- 2 yearsForeign Secretary (2016-2018) Nevertheless, a year later, he was on the rise again - resigning from his Spectator post when new Tory leaderDavid Cameron made him shadow higher education minister,external. However, he continued to write for the Telegraph and had to make another apology - to a whole country - after helinked Papua New Guinea to ""cannibalism and chief-killing"",externalin a column. By 2007, the Henley MP had his sights set on one of the biggest jobs in UK politics. Taking over from Labour's Ken Livingstone in 2008, Boris Johnson remained London mayor until 2016. It is the longest continuous period of public office that he has held. He's often spoken of what he considers to be his biggest achievements during that period: on crime, housing and transport.

Crime The homicide rate in London - which includes murder and manslaughter - fell from 22 per million to 12 per million people during his time as mayor. However, it was also falling during his predecessor's second term. And in the first few years after Mr Johnson took over, knife crime rose by over 15% - although from 2012-13 onwards it started to fall. Mr Johnson had backed the police use of stop-and-search powers to tackle violent crime. And he said he would ensure police numbers would go up despite central government cuts. Home Office figures show police numbers in London rose slightly, from 31,460 to 32,125, between March 2008 and March 2016. Across England and Wales in that period the number of officers fell by 17,603. Housing There was an increase in the number of affordable homes built - 101,525 by the end of March 2016, of which the Greater London Authority contributed to 94,001. This was a rise compared with the two terms of Mr Livingstone, although the definition of affordable housing had changed in 2011 so the figures are not directly comparable. Transport He scrapped the so-called bendy buses- which he said were too big for narrow streets and encouraged fare-dodgers. In their place, he introduced a new version of the popular Routemaster London bus - a move that was criticised as a vanity project. There were complaints about non-opening windows and problems with the hybrid engines. They also cost considerably more than a normal bus. Do Boris Johnson's claims about his record as mayor of London add up? The transport legacy of Boris Johnson in London One of his most famous transport initiatives was the so-called ""Boris Bike"" cycle scheme, introduced in July 2010. Mr Johnson regularly promoted the hire bikes by riding them himself and the number of rentals reached more than 10.3 million during his last year as mayor. However, critics pointed to the Â£11m-a-year cost of keeping the bikes on the road. Others pointed out that plans for a bike hire scheme had been announced while Mr Livingstone had been mayor. Olympics As mayor, Mr Johnson became involved in overseeing arrangements for the 2012 Olympics, planning for which started after they were awarded to London in 2005. One of the most memorable moments was when he got stuck on a zip wire, while celebrating the UK's first gold medal win. The Olympics were widely seen as a success and there were claimsthat they had provided a major economic boost. But there were also questions raised about the Olympics' legacy, including criticism of the conversion of the Olympic Stadium into a football ground. In 2017, an independent review saidthe conversion had cost Â£323m - far more than the original estimate of Â£190m. Garden Bridge The latter part of his time as mayor sawa plan to build a garden bridge over the River Thamesas a memorial to Princess Diana. The pedestrian-only bridge, with trees and plants, which was first suggested by the actress Joanna Lumley in 1998, was to be funded by private and public money. But it was cancelled in 2017, after a review recommended the project be scrapped - Â£53m had already been spent on the project; Â£43m of which came from the public purse. Appointed foreign secretary in 2018 - after Boris Johnson's resignation Was health secretary for a record six years Wants to renegotiate the Brexit deal What's Jeremy Hunt's track record? Mr Johnson decided he wanted to return to Parliament before his term as mayor ended, in 2016. He won the seat of Uxbridge and South Ruislip in 2015. After resuming life as an MP, he declared his opposition to expanding nearby Heathrow airport, saying he would lie in front of the bulldozers. As London mayor, he had promoted an alternative scheme, for an island airport in the Thames estuary,an idea rejected on cost and environmental grounds. But Mr Johnson was noticeably absent when MPs subsequently voted on Heathrow expansion in June 2018, as he was on an official trip to Afghanistan. Mr Johnson had been appointed foreign secretary by the new prime minister, Theresa May, in 2016. He had also run in the Tory leadership campaign that yearbut dramatically pulled outafter Michael Gove's surprise decision to enter the race. The job as foreign secretary was seen as an acknowledgement of his role as a leading figure in the campaign to leave the EU. However, there was also some surprise at the choice, with Lib Dem leader Tim Farron saying he would""spend more time apologising to nations he's offended""than working as foreign secretary. And there were the disparaging comments about other countries and their leaders - some of which were made before he got the job. They included a Limerick - which won a Â£1,000 award in 2016 - about Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and a goat. And he said the Libyan city of Sirte could be the new Dubai if""they... clear the dead bodies away"". Russian expulsions As foreign secretary, Mr Johnson supported a tough line against Russia,with the expulsion of its diplomats after the poisoning of former spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia Skripal. Twenty-nine countries, including the US, Canada, Australia and EU states, joined the UK, expelling more than 140 Russian diplomats in a co-ordinated move. Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe has been detained in Iran since 2016 Iran But in the case of British Iranian national Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, jailed in Iran, Mr Johnson had to apologise in Parliament. He had said she had been teaching journalists in Iran when she had been detained, contradicting her statement that she had been on holiday at the time. He later clarified that she had in fact been on holiday but has also said he does not believe his remarks made a difference to her plight - a claim rejected by her family. A few days after Mr Johnson made his remarks, Zaghari-Ratcliffe was summoned before an Iranian judge, to face charges of engaging in propaganda against the regime. How Boris Johnson insulted the world Boris Johnson's most controversial foreign insults Saudi Arabia As foreign secretary,he also earned a rebuke from Downing Street, after comments emerged in which he had criticised close ally Saudi Arabia for engaging in proxy wars in the Middle East. Nevertheless, he continued to allow sales of UK arms to Saudi Arabia, which is involved in a controversial military campaign in Yemen. In 2018, Mr Johnson also faced criticism after writing in the Daily Telegraph thatMuslim women wearing the burka ""looked like letterboxes"". By this stage, though, he had left the government, resigning in protest at Theresa May's Brexit plan. Boris Johnson was a leading figure in the Vote Leave campaign during the 2016 EU referendum. He became well known for his attacks on the EU and for advocating the benefits of Brexit. He declared that he was ""pro-having cake and pro-eating it"". But it hadn't always been clear which side he would support. In fact, while mayor of London, he'd spoken of the benefits of being in the single market. And in an article for the Daily Telegraph in 2013,external, weighing up the pros and cons of being in the EU, he had said that leaving would not solve the UK's problems. However, he also made clear he supported plans to ask the British people to decide about EU membership. During the Brexit campaign, he came undersustained criticism from those in favour of Remain, for his claims about the benefits of leaving and what he called ""taking back control"". Â£350m claim Most controversial was a claim about how much money the UK sent to the EU. The Â£350m-a-week figure, which appeared on the side of a bus during the campaign,recently led to an unsuccessful attempt to prosecute him.Critics pointed out at the time that the figure was wrong as it did not take into account the UK's rebate, or indeed money subsequently spent in the UK. For his part, Mr Johnson dismissed warnings that leaving the EU could spark a recession,describing one such study as propaganda. And he has continued to advocate a harder form of Brexit, sharply criticising both the deal that Mrs May agreed and her whole approach to the negotiations with the EU. He described it asleading the UK into the ""status of a colony"", in his resignation letter, in July 2018.

"Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt will face Boris Johnson in the run-off to become Conservative leader and prime minister. Mr Hunt oversaw the London Olympics as culture secretary and was the UK's longest-serving health secretary. Before entering Parliament, Jeremy Hunt had a career as an English teacher in Japan and as an entrepreneur. He became the MP for South West Surrey at the 2005 general election, taking over from Virginia Bottomley. From 2005 to 2007, Mr Hunt was shadow minister for disabled people. It was a reward for supporting David Cameron, who attended Oxford University at the same time as him, in the Conservative leadership election.  2018-presentForeign secretary 2012-2018Health secretary 2010-2012Culture secretary 2007-2010Shadow culture secretary 2005-2007Shadow minister for disabled people A reshuffle in 2007 saw Mr Hunt promoted to shadow culture secretary. In 2009, he was found to havebreached expenses rules and ordered to repay more than Â£9,500,external. He had allowed his agent to stay rent-free in his constituency property, which was designated as his second home. Mr Hunt had claimed Â£19,117 in public money towards the property, but it was decided he hadn't benefited financially from the situation. When the Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition government was formed in 2010, Jeremy Hunt joined the cabinet as secretary of state for culture, Olympics, media and sport. Olympics It was a key role in the run-up to London's 2012 Olympics and he worked closely with then London Mayor, Boris Johnson. Mr Hunt campaigned on the importance of tourism during the Olympics. And he took the decision to double the budget for the Olympic and Paralympic ceremonies from Â£40m to Â£81m. The Olympic opening ceremony was widely seen as a big success. This video can not be played Jeremy Hunt's bell-ringing clanger Mr Hunt also put emphasis on creating a lasting legacy for the games. The government gave Sport England Â£1bn to invest in grassroots sports, and Mr Hunt said there was an ""extraordinary chance"" to ""reinvigorate this country's sporting habits for both the young and the old"". But in the years that followed there wasonly a small increase in the number of young people taking up sport. In 2005-06 the proportion of over-16s in England who played sport for at least 30 minutes each week was 34.6%. By 2015-16, it was 36.1%. BSkyB takeover Earlier in 2012, his career was hanging in the balance. During the Leveson Inquiry into the culture and practices of the press, his contact with the Murdoch family came under scrutiny. Mr Hunt was responsible for overseeing the proposed takeover of BSkyB by Rupert Murdoch's News Corp. He was criticised for failing to supervise his adviser's contact with News Corp, and for messages he exchanged with James Murdoch on the bid. His special adviser, Adam Smith, was forced to quit. The inquiry released texts sent from Mr Hunt to News Corp lobbyist Fred Michel when it was bidding for BSkyB. The culture secretary addressed him as ""Daddy"" and ""mon ami"" - their wives had given birth in the same hospital in May 2010. Separately, in December 2010, he told Mr Michel there was ""nothing u won't like"" in a forthcoming speech. Mr Hunt insisted he acted with ""total integrity"" during the bid process. Local television As culture secretary, Mr Hunt also led a government plan to launch local television stations across the UK. More than 30 had been set up beforeOfcom later scrapped,externalthe roll-out of any further channels, because of limited interest from viewers and financial difficulties. City TV, the holder of the local TV licence for Birmingham, was forced to appoint administrators to find a buyer before it was even launched, for example. Boris Johnson: What's his track record? Tory leadership candidates compared: Johnson v Hunt Reality Check: What is 'no-deal Brexit'? BBC Mr Hunt also announced a deal with the BBC to freeze the licence fee for six years at Â£145.50 from 2010. He said high executive salaries and an advantage over commercial broadcasters were a cause for concern. That was equivalent to a 16% budget cut in real terms and led to the BBC having to make savings, including 2,000 job losses. Under the agreement, the BBC also took on responsibility for funding the World Service, the Welsh language channel S4C, and the roll-out of broadband to rural areas. Was mayor of London for eight years, overseeing the London 2012 Olympics Resigned as foreign secretary over Theresa May's Brexit strategy Wants to renegotiate the Brexit deal What's Boris Johnson's track record? Jeremy Hunt was appointed health secretary in September 2012, with Maria Miller taking on his previous role. He would eventually become the longest-serving health secretary in NHS history, surpassing its founder, Labour's Aneurin Bevan. NHS funding But Mr Hunt held office during the slowest period of investment in the NHS since its foundation - which created big problems. Since the NHS was established, health spending has risen by about 4% above inflation each year on average. Post-2010, as the coalition budget tried to reduce the deficit, this fell to about 1% a year. This came as demands on the health service were growing. Between 2005 and 2015, A&E visits went up by almost 30%. And during Mr Hunt's tenure as health secretary, the number of people in the population aged 85 and over went up by about a third. The independent Office for Budget Responsibility said funding for the NHS needed to rise by 4.3% a year just to keep up with rising demand, without actively improving standards. Financial difficulties led to more hospitals going into the red, as well as targets being missed in three main areas: cancer care, hospital appointments and A&E waiting times. NHS England has not met any of these targets since 2015. Just 85.3% of patients were seen at A&E departments within the waiting time target of four hours in January 2018. At least 95% of patients attending A&E are supposed to be either admitted, transferred or discharged within four hours. Unions, like the GMB, demanded his resignation. Junior doctors battle As well as a series of austerity measures - which included extending a cap on pay increases for NHS staff - he was also criticised for his handling of the junior doctor contract row. Mr Hunt said that changes to contracts were essential to deliver a seven-day NHS in England by 2020 - a pledge in the Conservatives' 2010 election manifesto. To achieve this, the proposed contracts would mean evenings and Saturdays would be considered ""normal"" rather than ""unsocial"" hours and would no longer attract overtime pay. The NHS's pay review body had said the cost of paying a premium on these ""unsocial hours"" put delivering a seven-day NHS out of reach. Reality Check: How much has social care been cut? Junior doctors responded by tweeting pictures of themselves working weekend and late shifts, with the hashtag #ImInWorkJeremy. Contract negotiations with junior doctors stopped and started and the British Medical Association eventually decided on industrial action. Junior doctors took part in a series of walkouts in 2016. On two strike days, between 08:00 and 17:00 even emergency care wasn't covered - the first time that had ever happened in the history of the NHS. Public support for the strike was high, and even after doctors withdrew emergency care, the majority of the public (57%) still supported the strike and believed the government was more at fault (54%). A newcontract for junior doctors was later imposed, after BMA members rejected a deal agreed by the government and union negotiators. Despite heavy criticism, Mr Hunt did go on to secure a funding increase for the NHS, totalling Â£20.5bn in real terms by 2023. He also oversaw the introduction of an Ofsted-style system for rating hospitals and GP surgeries in England, ranking them on things like cancer, mental health and diabetes services. Patient safety Mr Hunt repeatedly referred in speeches to cases where individuals had received bad treatment in the NHS. He said he was horrified at the report into theStafford Hospital scandal. He went on to overhaul the inspection regime, introduce a new duty of candour on staff and fresh rules about whistle-blowers. Social care Social care was added to his brief in 2018. He spoke of the need to integrate social care, funded by local councils, with services delivered by the NHS. He had already overseen a transfer of money from the NHS to council budgets from 2014. This shared budget was designed to tackle the problem of elderly people having to stay in hospital beds unnecessarily, because of a lack of care for them at home. After this, the number of these cases fell. He also oversaw the introduction of the first national waiting-time target for mental health treatment. From April 2016, the NHS said at least 50% of people experiencing a first episode of psychosis should begin treatment within two weeks of referral. Mr Hunt became foreign secretary in July 2018, after his predecessor and now leadership rival, Boris Johnson, quit over Theresa May's Brexit strategy. In March, he becamethe first Western foreign minister to visit Yemen since conflict there began,external. He has faced criticism for allowing the UK to sell arms to the Saudi regime, which is involved in a controversial military campaign in Yemen. But he has previously defended UK-Saudi ties, saying Saudi Arabia is a ""very, very important military ally to the UK"". His time as foreign secretary has not been gaffe-free. During a meeting on an official visit to China, he called his wife Lucia Guo ""Japanese"" - although she was born in Xian in central China. This video can not be played The foreign secretary tells Today he would include the DUP and ERG in Brexit talks A Remain campaigner in the 2016 EU referendum, Mr Hunt has since said he would vote Leave in a second vote. He said this was because of the ""arrogance of the European Commission"" in Brexit negotiations. He also likened the Brexit negotiating tactics of the EU to the Soviet Union. The comparison provoked criticism from EU ambassadors and politicians and there were calls for an apology. Mr Hunt says he want to negotiate a ""credible"" Brexit plan by securing changes tothe controversial Irish backstop. However, he does not rule out leaving the EU without a deal if such an outcome becomes ""the only way to deliver Brexit"". But unlike his leadership rival, Boris Johnson, he says the current departure date of 31 October is not a hard deadline.

"Northern Ireland could face a massive public sector back-pay bill after a tribunal finding thatpolice officers and civilian staff are owed money for a shortfall in holiday pay dating back 20 yearswas upheld. The class action was brought by a group representing more than 3,700 police officers and civilian staff, butthe implications could be wider with a trade union saying the case involves all workers and not just those in the public sector. The key question is not what is holiday pay, but rather what is normal pay as this determines holiday pay. Under UK law, most workers who work a 5-day week must receiveat least 28 days' paid annual leave a year,external. However, if you regularly work overtime, your normal pay would be more than your basic pay. Normal pay is calculated by combining your basic pay, along with any extra hours you work on a regular basis - ie overtime. If you regularly work overtime, your holiday pay should reflect your normal pay. The Court of Appeal upheld a tribunal ruling that Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) holiday pay should be based on pay including overtime and allowances, if this is what the person is ""normally paid"". The solicitor representing nine of the 11 lead police claimants and two civilian staff claimants, John McShane, said the previous calculations of holiday pay were based only on a basic rate of pay and had not ""taken into account the often extensive additional hours required by their work which therefore form part of their normal pay"". This meant they received less pay when on holiday compared to when they were working. The legal claim was based on a case in Britain in 2014 in which theEmployment Appeal Tribunal in Great Britain ruled that overtime should be included in holiday pay. Holiday pay case could affect 'every worker' in NI The judge said the pay issue was ""extremely serious"" and the current situation breached European law. When the original tribunal decision was made in 2018, the PSNI and Police Authority faced a bill of up to Â£30m, but that figure could now have grown to at least Â£40m. It is understood individual payments could be in the region of Â£10,000 on average. Trade union Nipsa said the ruling could go beyond the public sector and affect private sector employees as well. There are about 208,000 public sector employees in Northern Ireland, latest official figures show. The public sector bill would be a big challenge to Stormont's budgets, especially given the payments that will need to be made to RHI claimants and the fact that departments are currently being run without ministerial supervision. When the Westminster government realised the potential financial exposure of the 2014 decision, they rushed through legislation to cap the costs. These changes in the regulations limited employees to only being able claim for money owed going back two years. Northern Ireland did not follow suit, despite the then Stormont Employment Minister Stephen Farry holding discussions with civil servants about the potential financial implications of the holiday pay ruling. On Friday the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategyconfirmed it held detailed talks with its Stormont counterparts about the 2014 cap, but it was never extended to Northern Ireland. Overtime should count in holiday pay In November 2014, judges decide in a case known asBear Scotland v Fulton,externalthatemployees who were regularly required to work overtime should get extra holiday pay. As a result, in December 2014, the UK Government takes action to reduce the potential costs of that decision to employers and the ""potentially damaging impact of large backdated claims"". It makes changes to regulations under the Employment Rights Act 1996 so that claims to employment tribunals on this issue cannot stretch back further than two years - effectively adding cost controls. PSNI officers take court action over holiday pay In 2017, more than 1,000 PSNI officers take legal action over holiday pay in the light of the Bear Scotland ruling - at his stage some police forces in Great Britain had already settled claims with officers. The then Deputy Chief Constable Drew Harris said it was ""understandable"" that officers should seek their entitlements, but warned that because of the amount of money involved, the case could have an impact on the PSNI's operations. PSNI and Police Authority could face Â£30m holiday pay bill PSNI and the Police Authority face a holiday pay bill of up to Â£30m after a tribunal ruled in favour of a class action brought by a group representing more than 3,700 officers and staff. A judge said staff were owed money as their holiday pay had been based on basic working hours, not the actual hours worked including overtime adding that the pay issue was ""extremely serious"" and breached European law. PSNI and Police Authority could face Â£40m holiday pay bill The Court of Appeal in Belfast upholds the 2018 tribunal finding meaning that 3,700 police officers and civilian staff  are owed money for a shortfall in holiday pay dating back 20 years, with the potential bill now up to Â£40m with warnings that it could go even higher.

"Police were called to the London home of Boris Johnson and his partner in the early hours of Friday after neighbours reportedly heard a loud argument. The Guardian said,externalCarrie Symonds was heard telling the Conservative MP to ""get off me"" and ""get out of my flat"". The Metropolitan Police told the BBC it ""spoke to all occupants of the address, who were all safe and well"". In a statement, it said ""there was no cause for police action"". A spokesman for Mr Johnson said: ""No comment"". Mr Johnson refused to answer questions as he arrived at Birmingham ahead of the first of the Conservative Party's leadership membership hustings. Earlier, a neighbour of Ms Symonds in Camberwell, south London, told the Guardian they had heard a woman screaming followed by ""slamming and banging"". The paper said the neighbour was inside their own flat when they recorded the alleged altercation. It said that in the recording - heard by the newspaper, but not by the BBC - Mr Johnson was refusing to leave the flat and told the woman to ""get off"" his laptop, before there was a loud crashing noise. Ms Symonds is allegedly heard saying the MP had ruined a sofa with red wine: ""You just don't care for anything because you're spoilt. You have no care for money or anything."" Another neighbour, who would only give her name as Fatima, told the BBC: ""I heard a female voice, shouting and screaming, and then I heard things smashing, it sounded like plates or glasses. ""I couldn't hear what she was saying but she sounded really angry."" Conservative MP Dominic Grieve told BBC Radio 4's Today programme he could not comment on the Guardian's report specifically but said character was relevant in the contest to be leader of the party. ""They are going to be in a position of responsibility where they have to make very important decisions,"" he said. The former attorney general added: ""Clearly, things like reliability and honesty are very important things. ""And I think they matter in one's private and personal life, and also they matter in one's public life."" Carrie Symonds has been in a relationship with Mr Johnson since 2018 By BBC News correspondent Helena Wilkinson Boris Johnson would have preferred his politics - not his private life - to be making headlines. As we enter the final stage of this leadership campaign the scrutiny of the two men who want the top job will no doubt increase. There will be intense focus on their every move; their past, their present and their future. It's not surprising given the importance of the job they want - running the country. But does what allegedly happened in the London flat Mr Johnson shares with his partner really matter? His critics will say yes. They argue that we need someone of good character who can make difficult decisions and work under pressure. Supporters of Boris Johnson disagree. Whatever happened, they say, was an entirely private matter between two people in a relationship which should never have been recorded by a neighbour. Journalist Sonia Purnell, who has written a biography of Mr Johnson, told the Today programme she believed it was important to know a future leader's character. She said: ""It is the most unbelievably pressured job, crises will be coming at you day and night. You have to have equilibrium, a clear head, a stability in your life to be able to cope with that."" But, political commentator Tim Montgomerie told the BBC that until a complaint was made by Ms Symonds, the row ""should be a non-issue"". He added: ""If there was any domestic violence, Boris Johnson's candidacy would be toast and would deserve to be. ""But all we have at the moment is a partially overheard conversation between two people late at night. ""Unless there is a complaint I think we should draw a line under this."" Some of Mr Johnson's supporters have also taken to social media to defend him. Brexit minister James Cleverly questioned the motives of the ""person who recorded Boris and then gave the story to the Guardian"". Tory MP Michael Fabricant appeared to confuse Camberwell with Islington but wrote he was glad he did not have ""nosey neighbours"" recording private conversations, sending them to newspapers and ""wasting police time for political advantage"". Mr Johnson's relationship with Ms Symonds - a former director of communications for the Conservative party - became public after Mr Johnson and his wife announced they were divorcing in 2018. Ms Symonds was seen in the audience during Mr Johnson's leadership campaign launch on 12 June. In a statement, the Metropolitan Police said: ""At 00:24 on Friday 21 June, police responded to a call from a local resident in the SE5 area of Camberwell. ""The caller was concerned for the welfare of a female neighbour. ""Police attended and spoke to all occupants of the address, who were all safe and well. There were no offences or concerns apparent to the officers and there was no cause for police action.""

"Some things in life are difficult. Like attempting to learn the drums in your '50s, or, consequently, having to readjust to new neighbours. And there are some things in life that are really difficult, like ordering food in an unfamiliar language and then trying to persuade your 10-year-old child to eat boiled goat's testicles in a restaurant without making a fuss. But there are some things in life considered so difficult that conventional wisdom deems them nigh on impossible. Such as walking on air, or transferring Joseph Heller's 1961 classic novel Catch-22 from page to screen. Mike Nichol proved the sages right with his unconvincing 1970 film adaptation, but that was before today's golden age of slow-burn television where there is both the time and the money available to tell the fragmented, intricate story of an American Air squadron based on an island off the west coast of Italy during World War Two. Catch-22 by Joseph Heller was published in 1961, and hailed by one critic as ""the greatest satirical work in the English language"" Heller's novel was made into a film in 1970, starring Jon Voight and Anthony Perkins, and directed by Mike Nichols The good news for the production's backers was the multi-talented George Clooney was willing to help take the strain as a performer, a producer and a director of this Channel 4/Hulu six-part television adaptation by scriptwriters Luke Davies and David MichÃ´d. Clooney plays General Scheisskopf, a cartoon character of a part, which sees the Oscar-winning actor hamming it up as the cliched all-shouting, all-sneering parade ground bully who yells at those under his command for being a ""bunch of pansies"" etc. It is little more than a cameo, but enough I suppose to enable the publicity department to place his face all over the marketing materials. General Scheisskopf (George Clooney) shouting at Yossarian (Christopher Abbott), Clevinger (Pico Alexander) Clooney, who also directed two episodes, says the themes still resonate -- with people fighting ""against the system, and the system almost always winning"" Hugh Laurie has a similar sized role as the sniffily detached Major de Coverley, a minor part that also offers slim pickings for another very able actor. But he succeeds, you'll be delighted to see, in wringing every last drop of surreal humour from the pompous patrician whose denouement is to die for, so to speak. The heavy lifting falls to Christopher Abbott, who puts in an admirably restrained performance as main protagonist and anti-hero: the reluctant B25 bombardier John 'Yo-Yo' Yossarian. The unwilling serviceman is just about to reach the number of flying missions required to be discharged when the quota is suddenly raised and his homecoming hopes dashed. Understandably, he is annoyed. And then it happens again. And again. Christopher Abbott plays Yossarian, who is desperate to escape his bomber squadron In fact, every time he is about to fulfil his perilous airborne obligations the bar is raised and he's back up in the clouds and in harm's way; an actor in the Mediterranean theatre of war, not a player in his local bar. But then he hears you can be discharged from duties if you are certified insane. So, off he goes to see Doc Daneeka (Grant Heslov) to plead to be signed off. No can do, the doc says, before explaining that if Yossarian tells him he is so crazy that he must be withdrawn from duty he can't really be mad because requesting to be removed from imminent and obvious life-threatening danger is a wholly sane thing to do. It's a Catch-22. Yossarian (Christopher Abbott) tries to persuade Doc Daneeka (Grant Heslov) to declare him insane so he doesn't have to fly more missions And so the pressure mounts as does the body count and number of missions our gloomy bombardier must fly as decreed by the increasingly maniacal Colonel Cathcart (played by a slightly too absurdist Kyle Chandler). Yossarian's existential anxiety turns into a tormented inner frustration at the way in which he is convinced the Kafkaesque system is designed to thwart him, deny his freedom of choice, and ultimately lead to his death. Walking back to base one day, he shares his personal philosophy with a colleague: ""The enemy is anybody who's going to get you killed, no matter which side he is on, and that includes Cathcart."" It is a great line taken straight from Heller's novel, to which the TV series is largely faithful. Kyle Chandler says his character Colonel Cathcart, the base commander who keeps increasing the number of flying missions -- has no ""grasp on reality"" But fans of the book might be disappointed by how much of the complexity and texture of Heller's time-shifting, fractured creation has been flattened out by a production team opting for a traditional chronological narrative told from a single perspective. It is a structural decision that undermines one of Heller's main themes, which is the nature of memory and the notion of deja vu. The linear approach also creates an artistic problem. Heller used repetition both for purposes of symbolism, and also as a central storytelling device. With each shift back or forth in time, he added some new information, which would eventually pay off jokes and plot lines set up long before. It is that intricacy, humour and authorial dexterity that make the book so rewarding to read. Without those temporal changes the repetition device as deployed in the TV version is less effective, and at worse - as with the majority of flying scenes - boring. Maybe simplification was the only way Catch-22 was going to work on television. If so, it reflects mess officer Milo Minderbinder's (Daniel David Stewart) M&M enterprise, which, thankfully, brings the book's biting satire to life on the screen. Joseph Heller said ""I think the whole society is nuts - and the question is: What does a sane man do in an insane society?"" Major de Coverley (Hugh Laurie) is being tempted with a lamb chop by Milo Minderbinder (Daniel David Stewart), so he can be made Mess Officer His commercial imperatives influence decision-making among the airbase's military leaders, and not - as is their stated aim - military strategy. Money talks. And therein lies the crux of the story, it is not simply a question of what matters, but of what matters to whom. Minderbinder knows how to play the system, Yossarian does not. He is trapped. Doomed to exist in a never-ending cycle of fear and loneliness. You can see that in this TV series, but you never actually feel it.

"Some things in life are difficult. Like attempting to learn the drums in your '50s, or, consequently, having to readjust to new neighbours. And there are some things in life that are really difficult, like ordering food in an unfamiliar language and then trying to persuade your 10-year-old child to eat boiled goat's testicles in a restaurant without making a fuss. But there are some things in life considered so difficult that conventional wisdom deems them nigh on impossible. Such as walking on air, or transferring Joseph Heller's 1961 classic novel Catch-22 from page to screen. Mike Nichol proved the sages right with his unconvincing 1970 film adaptation, but that was before today's golden age of slow-burn television where there is both the time and the money available to tell the fragmented, intricate story of an American Air squadron based on an island off the west coast of Italy during World War Two. Catch-22 by Joseph Heller was published in 1961, and hailed by one critic as ""the greatest satirical work in the English language"" Heller's novel was made into a film in 1970, starring Jon Voight and Anthony Perkins, and directed by Mike Nichols The good news for the production's backers was the multi-talented George Clooney was willing to help take the strain as a performer, a producer and a director of this Channel 4/Hulu six-part television adaptation by scriptwriters Luke Davies and David MichÃ´d. Clooney plays General Scheisskopf, a cartoon character of a part, which sees the Oscar-winning actor hamming it up as the cliched all-shouting, all-sneering parade ground bully who yells at those under his command for being a ""bunch of pansies"" etc. It is little more than a cameo, but enough I suppose to enable the publicity department to place his face all over the marketing materials. General Scheisskopf (George Clooney) shouting at Yossarian (Christopher Abbott), Clevinger (Pico Alexander) Clooney, who also directed two episodes, says the themes still resonate -- with people fighting ""against the system, and the system almost always winning"" Hugh Laurie has a similar sized role as the sniffily detached Major de Coverley, a minor part that also offers slim pickings for another very able actor. But he succeeds, you'll be delighted to see, in wringing every last drop of surreal humour from the pompous patrician whose denouement is to die for, so to speak. The heavy lifting falls to Christopher Abbott, who puts in an admirably restrained performance as main protagonist and anti-hero: the reluctant B25 bombardier John 'Yo-Yo' Yossarian. The unwilling serviceman is just about to reach the number of flying missions required to be discharged when the quota is suddenly raised and his homecoming hopes dashed. Understandably, he is annoyed. And then it happens again. And again. Christopher Abbott plays Yossarian, who is desperate to escape his bomber squadron In fact, every time he is about to fulfil his perilous airborne obligations the bar is raised and he's back up in the clouds and in harm's way; an actor in the Mediterranean theatre of war, not a player in his local bar. But then he hears you can be discharged from duties if you are certified insane. So, off he goes to see Doc Daneeka (Grant Heslov) to plead to be signed off. No can do, the doc says, before explaining that if Yossarian tells him he is so crazy that he must be withdrawn from duty he can't really be mad because requesting to be removed from imminent and obvious life-threatening danger is a wholly sane thing to do. It's a Catch-22. Yossarian (Christopher Abbott) tries to persuade Doc Daneeka (Grant Heslov) to declare him insane so he doesn't have to fly more missions And so the pressure mounts as does the body count and number of missions our gloomy bombardier must fly as decreed by the increasingly maniacal Colonel Cathcart (played by a slightly too absurdist Kyle Chandler). Yossarian's existential anxiety turns into a tormented inner frustration at the way in which he is convinced the Kafkaesque system is designed to thwart him, deny his freedom of choice, and ultimately lead to his death. Walking back to base one day, he shares his personal philosophy with a colleague: ""The enemy is anybody who's going to get you killed, no matter which side he is on, and that includes Cathcart."" It is a great line taken straight from Heller's novel, to which the TV series is largely faithful. Kyle Chandler says his character Colonel Cathcart, the base commander who keeps increasing the number of flying missions -- has no ""grasp on reality"" But fans of the book might be disappointed by how much of the complexity and texture of Heller's time-shifting, fractured creation has been flattened out by a production team opting for a traditional chronological narrative told from a single perspective. It is a structural decision that undermines one of Heller's main themes, which is the nature of memory and the notion of deja vu. The linear approach also creates an artistic problem. Heller used repetition both for purposes of symbolism, and also as a central storytelling device. With each shift back or forth in time, he added some new information, which would eventually pay off jokes and plot lines set up long before. It is that intricacy, humour and authorial dexterity that make the book so rewarding to read. Without those temporal changes the repetition device as deployed in the TV version is less effective, and at worse - as with the majority of flying scenes - boring. Maybe simplification was the only way Catch-22 was going to work on television. If so, it reflects mess officer Milo Minderbinder's (Daniel David Stewart) M&M enterprise, which, thankfully, brings the book's biting satire to life on the screen. Joseph Heller said ""I think the whole society is nuts - and the question is: What does a sane man do in an insane society?"" Major de Coverley (Hugh Laurie) is being tempted with a lamb chop by Milo Minderbinder (Daniel David Stewart), so he can be made Mess Officer His commercial imperatives influence decision-making among the airbase's military leaders, and not - as is their stated aim - military strategy. Money talks. And therein lies the crux of the story, it is not simply a question of what matters, but of what matters to whom. Minderbinder knows how to play the system, Yossarian does not. He is trapped. Doomed to exist in a never-ending cycle of fear and loneliness. You can see that in this TV series, but you never actually feel it.

"Alstom's proposed design for a HS2 train Business leaders are calling on the next prime minister to commit to delivering HS2 in full. In an open letter, more than 20 business leaders say continued backing for the next phase of theÂ£56bn high-speed rail network projectis vital. Construction of the first HS2 link between London and the West Midlands is currently under way. Business leaders want to see the line linking Birmingham, Manchester and Leeds completed as well. The open letter, targeted at whoever wins the Conservative leadership vote out of Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt, has been signed by business groups including the CBI, the Institute of Directors, the Federation of Small Businesses, the British Chambers of Commerce, London First and Business Improvement Districts across the UK. NPP: Businesses want 'Northern Crossrail' investment HS2 will 'short change' the North, say peers Kenilworth Show: HS2 uncertainty 'threatens' future of farming event It comes almost five years after the ""Northern Powerhouse"" concept, first mentioned by the then Chancellor, George Osborne, in a speech on 23 June 2014. Mr Osborne had planned to improve transport connections between the cities, towns and rural communities of the north of England and Wales, in order to increase jobs and fuel economic growth in the region. The groups assert that the HS2 has already led to record foreign investment in the West Midlands, including the creation of 7,000 new jobs in Birmingham, with a further 100,000 more expected around the new Curzon Street and Interchange stations. Business leaders are concerned that the forthcoming change of prime minister could lead to the rail network not being completed. In May, a group of peers warned thatHS2 would not offer value for moneyand risked ""short-changing"" the North of England. The House of Lords Economic Affairs Committee said the project should not go ahead without a new assessment of its costs and benefits. ""We assert that committing to HS2 in full, once and for all, will spread the flow of investment across the Midlands, the North of England and into Scotland,"" the leaders wrote in the letter. ""The current poor connectivity in the North is a major obstacle to encouraging companies from growing in the region and is a barrier to inward investment."" According to Transport for the North, fewer than 10,000 people in northern England are able to access four or more of the region's largest economic centres within an hour. The leaders wrote: ""We urge the next prime minister and government to restate its commitment to Northern Powerhouse Rail, and its links to HS2, as a matter of urgent priority. ""We are passionate believers that this is not just a Northern issue. It is a UK issue. ""We should move away from arguments that pit Crossrail 2 in London versus Northern Powerhouse Rail; both schemes are vital for Britain's future. It's not an either/or choice. Britain needs both."" The Department for Transport told the BBC: ""HS2 is well under way, with over 9,000 people and 2,000 businesses working on delivering the project right now. It will significantly improve connections between our largest cities, create extra capacity across our rail network and release capacity on some of our busiest rail lines.

"Mike Dorricott, pictured with his daughter Sarah, died in 2015 Conservative leadership contender Jeremy Hunt failed to keep his promise to a man with terminal cancer during his time as health secretary, an inquiry was told. Mike Dorricott died in 2015 from liver cancer linked to the hepatitis C he contracted through infected blood. His widow Ann told the inquiry into the scandal Mr Hunt had promised to ""sort out"" a settlement for victims. A spokesman for Mr Hunt said he had ""pushed for this landmark inquiry"". Mr Dorricott, who died aged 47, campaigned for fair compensation for those affected by contaminated blood products before his death and met Mr Hunt, his South West Surrey MP, on numerous occasions. More news from Yorkshire The inquiry is looking at why 4,800 people with haemophiliawere infected with hepatitis C or HIVin the 1970s and 1980s. More than 2,000 are thought to have died. By Hugh Pym, BBC News health editor It was the first strong criticism of a politician at the infected blood inquiry and it won't be the last. Ann Dorricott recalled a meeting with Jeremy Hunt and his officials in 2014 when he seemed to indicate support for the idea of a ""fair and final settlement"".  Campaigners have long called for full compensation for victims and their families covering loss of earnings and recompense for their mistreatment by the NHS. Currently they get financial support intended to cover living costs.  Compensation has not been delivered in the UK as it has in Ireland, hence Ann Dorricott's view that a promise had been broken.  A spokesperson for Mr Hunt said he had increased financial support since the meeting and pushed for the inquiry. As the hearings continue this year and next, former health secretaries will be called to give evidence and the former Prime Minister Sir John Major.  The inquiry will probe the Government's handling of what's been called the worst treatment disaster in the history of the NHS. Mrs Dorricott told the inquiry, sitting in Leeds, that a meeting had been held shortly after her husband's terminal diagnosis to discuss a ""fair and final settlement"" for the victims. ""When Mike told the room that it was terminal, Mike got very upset, very emotional,"" she said. ""Towards the end of the meeting, Jeremy Hunt came to myself and Mike, shook our hands and said to us, 'don't worry about this, we'll sort it'. ""Those were his words."" This sign was placed outside Jeremy Hunt's constituency office in Surrey after Mr Dorricott's death Counsel to the inquiry, Jenni Richards, asked Mrs Dorricott about her witness statement. ""You say in your statement this 'since that meeting he has not fulfilled his promise'. That is your view and that was Mike's view?"" Mrs Dorricott replied: ""Yes."" A spokesman for Mr Hunt, currently foreign secretary, said: ""The Dorricott family are among thousands who have faced tragedy as a result of this appalling injustice. ""As well as increasing the financial support for victims, Jeremy pushed for this landmark inquiry because those affected have a right to know what went wrong and why."" The family said Mr Dorricott, who had mild haemophilia, had been given a contaminated blood product in 1982 during routine dental surgery in Huddersfield near his home in West Yorkshire. He would only discover he had hepatitis C almost 25 years later, and numerous treatments and two liver transplants followed before he was told his condition was terminal in 2014. ""We tried to lead a normal life for the girls, but it was just out of our control,"" Mrs Dorricott told the inquiry. Blood victims 'given death sentence' What is the infected blood scandal?

"E. Jean Carroll - seen here at an event in 2015 - has made the allegation in an article US President Donald Trump has dismissed allegations that he raped a woman in a department store dressing room in the mid-1990s as ""fiction"". The US president says he never met E. Jean Carroll and accuses her of making up the allegation to sell a new book. Ms Carroll says she did not report the alleged attack at the time after being advised by a friend she had no chance of winning in court. Her story was published in New York magazine on Friday. More than a dozen women have previously made sexual misconduct allegations against Mr Trump, which he has denied. In the article,she describes meeting Mr Trump,externalin late 1995 or early 1996, in Bergdorf Goodman. She says she recognised him as the ""real estate tycoon"" and that he told her he was buying a present for ""a girl"". She says Mr Trump knew she was a TV agony aunt and the two joked around, encouraging each other to try on some lingerie. She alleges that they then went to a dressing room, where she accuses him of raping her. Both Mr Trump and Ms Carroll were aged around 50 at the time, and he was married to Marla Maples. Ms Carroll says she told two friends about the alleged incident, one of whom advised her to go to the police. But she says the other advised her against telling anyone saying: ""Forget it! He has 200 lawyers. He'll bury you."" The accusation is one of six alleged attacks by ""hideous men"" that Ms Carroll details in her article. Another alleged incident involves Les Moonves, the former CEO of CBS.He resigned in 2018 after allegations of sexual misconduct. Mr Moonves' representative told New York magazine he ""emphatically denies"" the incident. Ms Carroll ends the article by saying Mr Trump was her ""last hideous man"" and she has not had sex since then. ""I've never met this person in my life,"" the US president said in a statement. ""She is trying to sell a new book - that should indicate her motivation.  It should be sold in the fiction section."" However, the New York magazine article included an image of Mr Trump and Ms Carroll together at an NBC party around 1987. When he was asked about the photo on Saturday, Mr Trump said: ""Standing with my coat on in a line, give me a break, with my back to the camera. I have no idea who she is."" He added: ""There is some picture where we're shaking hands it looks like at some kind of event. I have my coat on, I have my wife standing next to me, and I didn't know her husband but he was a newscaster. But I have no idea who she is."" Mr Trump encouraged anyone with information that the Democratic Party is working with Ms Carroll or New York magazine to notify the White House. Mr Trump has described the allegations as ""a disgrace"" He accused the publication of ""peddling fake news"" and called the magazine a ""failing business."" ""Shame on those who make up false stories of assault to try to get publicity for themselves, or sell a book, or carry out a political agenda,"" he said. ""It's just as bad for people to believe it, particularly when there is zero evidence,"" he added. In his statement, Mr Trump thanked Bergdorf Goodman, the upmarket New York department store where the incident allegedly took place, for ""confirming they have no video footage of any such incident"".
