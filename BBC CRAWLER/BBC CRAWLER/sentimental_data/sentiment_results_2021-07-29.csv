"Around 60,000 deaths have been prevented in England as a result of the Covid vaccine programme, the deputy chief medical officer has said. Prof Jonathan Van-Tam said an estimated 22 million cases have also been stopped - a ""truly massive"" success. His comments came in a special programme with Radio 1 Newsbeat listeners, including some who are worried about getting a jab. He said the more people get a jab, the less likely more lockdowns are. Bar staff told to delete Covid app over pingdemic How many under-30s are unvaccinated? Covid: Have we passed the peak and can we relax? The chances of another lockdown will be ""much lower"" if a higher proportion of the population, including 18-25-year-olds, get their jabs, he said. Nearly a third of young adults in England - about 2.7 million - have not had a first dose of a Covid-19 vaccine, NHS England figures show. Some 68.1% of people aged 18 to 29 had received a first dose by 25 July, according to estimates, meaning 31.9% are likely to not be jabbed. Prof Van-Tam also said he can't know yet if there will be a fourth wave of Covid infections in the UK. He disputed a claim made to a newspaper by a senior minister earlier this week that Covid was ""all over bar the shouting"", after a recent sharp drop in cases. Prof Van-Tam said: ""I wish it were so. This is not 'all over bar the shouting'. ""I hope the worst is behind us but I think it's quite possible that we're going to have one or two bumpy periods in the autumn and in the winter, not only through Covid, but also through flu and other respiratory viruses as well."" The estimate of 60,000 deaths avoided because of the vaccine, mentioned by Prof Van-Tam,comes from Public Health England (PHE),external, and was published shortly after he shared it with Newsbeat. This figure is a bit of an exaggeration. That's because it asks what would happen in a world with no vaccination and no new lockdowns. But it shouldn't be surprising for such a model to suggest that vaccines could have saved many tens of thousands of lives in England alone. The modellers behind the figure looked at the number of infections we've seen since the start of the year. They then asked how many of those infected people would have died if the death rates from 2020 still applied. That alone could account for thousands of deaths. Vaccines are also thought to have directly averted more than 52,600 hospital admissions, according to PHE. Previous estimates, for the period up to 9 July, had suggested about 37,000 deaths and 11 million infections had been prevented. A further 85 people in the UK have died within 28 days of a positive Covid test, according to thegovernment's latest daily figures.,external Another 31,117 cases of coronavirus were reported in the UK on Thursday, lower than the 39,906 cases reported a week earlier. Among those asking Prof Van-Tam questions was Sharnie, 19, a student in Coventry. She asked why someone like her who has had Covid - and only experienced mild cold and flu symptoms - should have a jab when she doesn't know the long-term effects of it. ""If there was anything very major going on in terms of side effects and long-term consequences we would have seen those signals and we just haven't,"" Prof Van-Tam said. He added that in the future it could get more difficult for those who haven't been vaccinated to access certain venues and go on holiday.

" How high might temperatures climb and how much rain might fall in your area and how? The BBC and the Met Office have looked at the UK's changing climate in detail to find out. Temperatures in the UK exceeded 40C for the first time on record earlier this summer, and extreme weather events are likely to become even more frequent. The Met Office climate projections cover different levels of global warming. When, or if, these levels are reached will depend on the concentration of greenhouse gases in our atmosphere. The data is measured in 12km-square (7.5-mile-square) grids across the UK. The results for your postcode represent an average for the grids closest to you and the mid-point of a range of future possibilities, which come from the Met Office’s most recent major climate modelling data.

If global temperatures rise by 4C, it could be about {{beginHighlight}}{{high_hottest_day}}C{{endHighlight}}. The hottest day recorded in the UK came in July 2022, with40.3C measured in at Coningsby in Lincolnshire. Human activity has increased carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions and caused rising temperatures worldwide since the growth of industrialisation in the 19th Century. If global average temperatures rise by 2C above pre-industrial levels, days at least as hot the 2019 record could be more frequent and widespread. And with a 4C rise, parts of the UK could see temperatures above 42C. Urgent cuts in emissions are needed to keep the rise in global average temperatures in check. The Glasgow Climate Pact,reached at the COP26 summit in 2021, agreed countries will meet this year to pledge further cuts to emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2). This is to try to keep temperature rises within 1.5C - which scientists say is required to prevent a ""climate catastrophe"". Current pledges, if met, will only limit global warming to about 2.4C. Use buttons to change season In the the 30 summers from 1991 to 2019, there were {{beginHighlight}} {{current_summer_days}} days{{endHighlight}} above 25C per month on average. If global temperatures rise by 2C, there could be {{beginHighlight}}{{medium_summer_days}} days{{endHighlight}}. With a 4C rise, there could be {{beginHighlight}}{{high_summer_days}} days{{endHighlight}}. The World Meteorological Organization (WMO) defines any day with a maximum temperature above 25C as a ""summer day"". In the 30 summers from 1991 to 2019, even the warmest places in the UK, located in the South, had no more than seven days a month above 25C on average. If global average temperatures rise by 2C, southern parts of the country could see more than 11 days per summer month go beyond 25C. If the rise is 4C, those places could have 20 or more summer days per month, and higher likelihood of hot spells triggering public-health warnings. The cooler, northern parts of the UK, which may not see many days above 25C even with a 4C rise, can nonetheless expect average daytime temperatures in summer to increase by at least 2.5C. The average daytime temperature in the UK in summercurrentlyranges from about 14C in northern Scotland to 22C in southern England.But summers have been getting warmer, with four of the 10 hottest summers up to 2019 recorded in the past two decades. Even if countries cut emissions and theworld warms by 2C, the whole UK could see higher summer temperatures.In some northern locations, the increase could be small. In southern areas, average summer temperatures could reach 24C. If emissions continue to increase and average global temperaturesrise by 4C, summers will be even hotter.Nearly a third of the UK could see average summer temperatures above 25C. The Met Office climate projections for the UK indicate significant temperature rises in the decades ahead for both winter and summer, with the greatest increases in the already warmer South. Extreme weather could become more frequent and intense. Not every summer will be hotter than the last – but temperature records are expected to be regularly broken, while heatwaves are likely to be longer and happen more often. Use buttons to change season In the 30 years from 1991 to 2019, there were {{beginHighlight}} {{current_rainy_days}} rainy days{{endHighlight}} on average per month in summer. If global average temperatures rise by 2C, this could be {{beginHighlight}}{{medium_rainy_days}} days{{endHighlight}} per month. At a 4C rise it could be about {{beginHighlight}}{{high_rainy_days}} days{{endHighlight}}. In the 30 years from 1991 to 2019, there were {{beginHighlight}}{{current_rainy_days}} rainy days{{endHighlight}} on average per month in winter. At both 2C and 4C rises, the number of rainy days per month could be roughly the same. As the world warms, fewer rainy days in summer are expected. Currently, over a quarter of the UK has 20 or more days without rain each summer month. This could grow to more than half the country if we reach 4C global warming. Winter rains could remain as likely as they are now. The number of days will vary from year-to-year, but rainy days in a warmer future could be wetter than today with total rainfall expected to rise. Use buttons to change season   In warmer winters the heaviest rains are likely to get more intense. If global average temperatures rise by 4C above pre-industrial levels, half the country could expect at least 20% more rainfall on the wettest winter days. Summer rains may also become heavier in many places, although total rainfall is expected to decline. Of course, not all of the heaviest rains will necessarily fall in these two seasons. The current wettest day on record was 3 October 2020, whenenough rain fell across all four nations to fill Loch Ness. Currently,the wettest areas of the UK dominate the west coast, with nearly all of Wales and western Scotland receiving most rain in winter months. So how much will change in future winters? With a2C rise, very little compared to what we've seen recently.But winters over the past 30 years have been rainier on average than previously, and the pattern of wetter winters could continue. The exact amount of change in rainfall at2C global warmingwill vary across the country. Most places could have slightly wetter winters than in the 20th Century. If global average temperatures were torise by 4C, more than half the country could see at least 10% more rain over the winter months. The UK climate projections suggest increases in winter rainfall in most parts of the country, as well as drier summers. Rainfall measurements fluctuate from year to year, making projections challenging. Not every winter will necessarily be rainier than the one before, and not every summer will be dry, but both trends could have big impacts. As the world warms, the UK is likely to have hotter, drier summers and warmer, wetter winters, according to the Met Office. Extreme weather events such as heatwaves and heavy downpours could become more frequent and more intense. Many scientists are concerned. ""I think it’s really frightening,” says Dr Lizzie Kendon, a senior Met Office scientist. “It's just a wake-up call really as to what we’re talking about here.” We are already seeing the impacts of climate change, but the level of global warming we reach and by when will depend primarily on the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. To some, warming weather may not seem like such a big deal. But even the smallest incremental changes in climate can have far-reaching effects. Temperatures above 30C for two or more days can trigger a public-health warning. In the 1990s, this happened about once every four years for locations in the South. By the 2070s, projections suggest it could be as frequently as four times per year - 16 times more often, if we do not curb our emissions. The Met Office projects rainy winters, which keep the soil wet into spring, and dry summers of infrequent rainfall will become the norm. Summer rain is likely to become less frequent but could be heavier. Without regular rainfall, the ground has a harder time absorbing water when it finally does come, leading to a greater risk of flash flooding. Floods will likely become a staple of warming winters as well. Steady rain, which is currently a feature of winter months, will probably continue, and total rainfall is expected to increase. When the ground is already saturated, waterways tend to rise. Bridges and sewers designed for historical rainfall levels may come increasingly under pressure. Warming temperatures could also mean cold spells become less frequent. Andsnowy UK winters could become thing of the pastas climate change affects the UK, according to Met Office analysis shared with BBC Panorama. Temperatures below freezing during the day and areas with considerable amounts of snow on the ground may be limited to parts of Scotland by the end of the century if emissions continue to rise. The BBC has collaborated with scientists from the Met Office to analyse data from their extensive weather measurement records and their major climate modelling project, theUK Climate Projections (UKCP). The present-day data shows averages of observed measurements for 1991-2019. The future data shows projected temperature and rainfall measurements produced by climate models for two different levels of global warming: if global average temperatures rise 2C above records from the mid-19th Century, the start of major industrialisation, and if that rise is 4C. Twelve different versions of the Met Office's Hadley Centre climate model were used in calculating the UKCP Regional (12km) projections using a high emissions gas scenario (RCP8.5). Climate models are computer simulations of how the atmosphere, oceans, land, plants and ice behave under various levels of atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations. They help scientists come up with projections for what conditions on Earth we are likely to see as global warming continues. The level of global warming depends on a number of factors. The most important is the amount of emissions produced in the coming years. Emissions are greenhouse gases released into our atmosphere. The accumulation of these gases has a warming effect on the globe, which in turn leads to changes in climatic conditions. Governments around the world have pledged to reduce their emissions to limit the degree of warming. During the Glasgow COP26 summit in 2021, countries agreed to meet the following year to pledge further major carbon cuts with the aim of keeping temperature rises within 1.5C above pre-industrial levels. If global temperatures rise by more than 1.5C, scientists say the Earth is likely to experience severe effectssuch as millions more people being exposed to extreme heat. If no interventions are taken, global average temperatures could rise by up to 4C by 2100. This high-emissions future is highlighted in themost recent Evidence Report for the UK's Climate Change Risk Assessment (CCRA)as possible, if less likely. Current pledges, if met, will only limit global warming to about 2.4C, while at current rates of global emissions, the world is on a pathway somewhere between 2C and 4C. The modelled projections in this data do not represent a specific time period. Instead, they show what conditions could be like in these two different levels of global warming. Some other climate data may project specific points in time by which a certain level of global warming may be reached. However, this model allows for the possibility of actions that may reduce or increase emissions enough to change the timing before we would experience a 2C or 4C future. More information on the methods used to calculate the timing of different levels of global warming can be found inthis 2018 Met Office paper. This tool presents six different measurements among those scientists use to gain a picture of the environment under various conditions. Each represents a specific predefined climate metric. 1. Hottest day is the maximum temperature recorded or projected on a single day 2. Summer days, as defined by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), have a maximum temperature above 25C 3. Average daytime temperature is the average of daily maximum air temperatures over a season 4. Rainy days are when more than 1mm of rain is recorded. This excludes days that may have had very light rain or a heavy morning dew or mist 5. Wettest day is the maximum amount of recorded or projected rainfall on a single day 6. Total rainfall is the amount in millimetres measured across a season. We also calculated and display the change in rainfall for the future scenarios as a percentage change from the current period (1991-2019) Climate data is typically presented in gridded squares that make up a large surface area. The grids used in this model are 12km by 12km. This level of detail is able to capture many of the varied climate conditions across the UK's diverse geography far better than other, broader-scale models. Each UK postcode has been matched to its nearest 12km-square grid. The results displayed for your area represent an average (mean) for the grids closest to that location, as long as they are no further than 34km away. In most cases a grid has been averaged with its eight nearest grids, except along irregular coastlines and small islands. Averaging means that the figures displayed are never for a single grid alone. While natural variability between grid areas is normal, this process minimises dramatic differences that may be down to chance. Both current and future data are organised into the same 12km-square grids. However, unlike future modelled predictions, the present-day data comes from actual observed measurements. We have presented a single number that represents an average for each grid and season. This helps to reduce the influence of outliers in observed data. For instance, the current number of summer days represents the mean number of days recording maximum temperatures of at least 25C per month in June, July and August across every year from 1991 to 2019. Each number presented in the two future scenarios represents the median of 12 possible outcomes as projected by the 12 model simulations. All future projection data has been calibrated by Met Office scientists against the data in the present-day range, 1991-2019, so the model results can be compared directly with observations. More information on the calibration technique used can be foundin this 2017 paper. Because climate data is gridded, the data may represent a larger area than that covered by a single weather station. Measurements from multiple weather stations are averaged together to give a single datapoint for a grid. Take the hottest day, for instance. If the highest temperature recorded at Cambridge Royal Botanic Gardens was 38.7C, that number is combined with measurements from other stations across the region to produce an average for a 12km-square area that includes Cambridge. Other weather stations will have recorded slightly lower temperatures, so the average highest temperature in this area would be less than 38.7C.

"The film was the first solo outing for Johansson's Black Widow character, after appearances in multiple Marvel movies Scarlett Johansson is suing Disney for breach of contract after it streamed her superhero film Black Widow at the same time as its cinema release. The film set a box office record for the Covid-19 pandemic, grossing $218m (Â£157m) in its first weekend. But box office receipts then fell sharply and Ms Johansson argues she was deprived of potential earnings. In response, Disney said it had ""fully complied"" with her contract and that her case had ""no merit whatsoever"". 'Rousing' Black Widow impresses most critics Johansson criticises sexualisation of Black Widow Ms Johansson said she was promised by Marvel Studios, which is owned by Disney, that Black Widow would be a ""theatrical release"". She said she had understood this to mean a ""window"" of time would pass before it would be streamed - a period that has traditionally lasted 90 days. During the pandemic a number of Hollywood studios opted to bypass cinemas, many of which had been closed, and release their films online instead. Now that most cinemas have reopened, Disney, along with fellow giant Warner Bros, has chosen to maintain a dual release strategy for their major films. A billboard promoting Black Widow in Hollywood, California On its first weekend, Black Widow took some $80m in ticket sales in North America and $78m internationally, plus at least $60m in Disney+ Premier Access rentals. Sources close to the actor, whose salary was based on the box office performance of the film, project that she lost $50m, according to media reports. Disney countered by claiming that the dual release strategy had ""significantly enhanced [Johansson's] ability to earn additional compensation on top of the $20m she has received to date"". In a strongly worded statement, it said her legal action was ""especially sad and distressing in its callous disregard for the horrific and prolonged global effects of the Covid-19 pandemic"". Johansson's agent fired back, accusing Disney of ""shamelessly"" trying to smear her character. ""Scarlett has been Disney's partner on nine movies, which have earned Disney and its shareholders billions,"" wrote Bryan Lourd in a statement. ""The company included her salary in their press statement in an attempt to weaponise her success as an artist and businesswoman, as if that were something she should be ashamed of. ""Disney's direct attack on her character and all else they implied is beneath the company that many of us in the creative community have worked with successfully for decades."" Before the pandemic, Hollywood film fans would typically have to watch new releases exclusively at the cinema or wait three months to have them streamed to their devices. Major studios have recently been mixing cinema releases and streaming in different ways as cinemas battle to win back viewers wary of catching Covid in confined spaces. Yet the move has not proved popular with some of the film industry's leading talents, among them Tenet and The Dark Knight director Christopher Nolan. Last year the British film-maker criticised Warner Brosover its plans to release major movies on HBO Max, describing the situation as ""a real bait and switch"". ""Warner Bros had an incredible machine for getting a film-maker's work out everywhere, both in theatres and in the home, and they are dismantling it as we speak,"" he told the Hollywood Reporter. ""Their decision makes no economic sense and even the most casual Wall Street investor can see the difference between disruption and dysfunction."" Matt Mueller, editor of industry publicationScreen Daily,external, said he expected the dispute would be resolved behind closed doors before it reached a courtroom. ""It's surprising that Disney let it get to this stage, given Warner Bros was able to negotiate with the talent that it irked when it made the decision to go day-and-date between cinemas and HBO Max for its 2021 titles,"" he told BBC News. ""I think other stars will look at how Scarlett's case proceeds, while studios with complementary streaming platforms will already be looking at what contractual steps they need to take to ward off further actions."" Warner Bros recently released Space Jam: A New Legacy in cinemas and on HBO Max Whatever the outcome of Johansson's case, Mueller doubts it will make Disney change its dual release strategy. ""Disney's ultimate boss is its shareholders and they want Disney+ to be hugely successful,"" he continued. ""But it might make the top talent think twice if they don't think they can score the mega-paydays that theatrical releases have been able to generate for stars in the past.""

"Amazon has predicted slower sales growth in the third quarter as a boost from the Covid pandemic subsides. Customers turned to Amazon and other online platforms during the Covid crisis, leading to record profits for the US giant. But Amazon's breakneck growth is beginning to level as customers start to return to bricks and mortar shops. Revenue climbed 27% to $113bn (Â£81bn) in its second quarter, but this missed analysts' expectations. Amazon shares fell more than 7% in after-hours trade. Earlier in the Covid pandemic Amazon posted record profits, signed up more than 200 million customers to its Prime service, and recruited more than 500,000 workers to keep up with surging demand. But vaccine rollouts and easing of restrictions have led some consumers to venture out to stores, while also using click-and-collect services, in competition with the speedy delivery of online orders provided by Amazon and its peers. Andy Jassy took over the top job at Amazon on 5 July Amazon's net sales rose to $113.08bn in the second quarter to 30 June from $88.91bn in the same period a year earlier. Analysts on average had expected $115.20bn. The world's biggest online retailer had moved its annual marketing bonanza, Prime Day, to June this year, hoping to sell more goods before shoppers went on holiday. It said the event was the biggest two-day sales period ever for merchants on its platform. But in the second quarter analysts have seen signs of slowing demand. North America, Amazon's largest market, saw sales increase 22% in the second quarter, versus 43% in the same period a year earlier. But profit rose 48% to $7.8bn, the second-largest quarterly result Amazon has ever announced. Jeff Bezos stepped back from the chief executive role on 5 July The retail giant's founder Jeff Bezos stepped down as chief executive on 5 July, becoming executive chair of Amazon's board. Andy Jassy took on role, after previously being in charge of Amazon's cloud computing division, Amazon Web Services (AWS). In the second quarter AWS was a bright spot, seeing revenue rise by 37% to $14.8bn. Mr Jassy said: ""Over the past 18 months, our consumer business has been called on to deliver an unprecedented number of items, including PPE [personal protective equipment], food, and other products that helped communities around the world cope with the difficult circumstances of the pandemic. ""At the same time, AWS has helped so many businesses and governments maintain business continuity, and we've seen AWS growth reaccelerate as more companies bring forward plans to transform their businesses and move to the cloud."" Amazon's are the latest results from Big Tech this week. Apple, Microsoft and Google's parent firm Alphabet all reported soaring profits as the Covid pandemic continues. Facebook, however, said that it expects revenue growth to slow. Tech giants' profits soar as pandemic boom continues Facebook warns growth set to slow 'significantly' Nicholas Hyett, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: ""It's saying something when you can report quarterly sales roughly equal to the annual GDP of Ukraine and 33% operating profit growth and still disappoint the market. ""You can see why Jeff Bezos would rather be jetting off into space. ""In all seriousness though, Amazon is increasingly bumping up against the law of large numbers - particularly in US retail. ""When you're only selling $1,000 of product a year, boosting sales by 40% is easy. When your annualised sales reach $400bn, finding an extra $160bn of sales is pretty difficult."" Mr Hyett said that means that Amazon is having to spend a lot to deliver future growth. ""The group's got plenty of irons in the fire for the future, it just needs to hope one of them comes off big,"" he added. The top job that Mr Jassy inherited has never been bigger and more complex. Last quarter Amazon, the biggest online retailer in the world, announced a deal to buy the film studio MGM for $8.5bn, expanding in Hollywood at the same time as it is running a grocery chain, building a healthcare business and facing scrutiny from regulators worldwide. Costs also continue to rise. The company has offered an average $17 in hourly wages - more than double the US minimum - plus signing bonuses to attract 75,000 workers during a labour shortage.

"Fashion shops have been closing, including chains such as Debenhams The number of empty shops in Britain has continued to rise as retailers struggle with the effects of the Covid pandemic, the British Retail Consortium has said. Shopping centres have been hardest hit, with nearly one in five units empty, the industry group said. The north east of England had the highest vacancy rate, followed by Wales and the north west. The Covid pandemic has accelerated a shift towards online shopping. Many shops were shuttered during lockdowns, although retail sales in June were near pre-lockdown levels,as the reopening of shops released pent-up demand. Retail sales near pre-lockdown levels in June However, fashion retailers have been hit hard by the pandemic, with the closure of well-known High Street brands such as Debenhams and Topshop contributing to vacancies. But it is shopping centres which had the highest vacancy rate from April to June. ""It comes as no surprise that the number of shuttered stores in the UK continues to rise, after retailers have been in and out of lockdown for over a year,"" said Helen Dickinson, chief executive of the British Retail Consortium (BRC). Almost one in five shopping centre units now lie empty, and more than one in eight units have been empty for more than a year. The vacancy rate in retail parks is also rising quickly as they lose stores. The number of empty shops could continue to rise following the ending of the business rates holiday, Ms Dickinson said. Since the start of the pandemic, the government announced a range of measures to help companies including business rates relief which ran until the end of June. Firms are currently paying a reduced rate. But Tony Brown, chief executive of Beales, the department store, told the BBC's Today programme that the resumption of full business rates payments ""is a sword of Damocles hanging over everybody"". He said that at Beales stores, which include Poole, Peterborough and the soon-to-open branch in Southport, ""we pay 10 times, sometimes 30 times more in [business] rates than we do in rent"". Beales, one of the UK's oldest department stores, fell into administration in January 2020 before the Covid pandemic was declared. It subsequently shut down all its shops but a business called New Start 2020 bought the name and Beales reopened a branch in Poole last year. Mr Brown said: ""The pandemic has allowed us to rethink the model as to how department stores should work and how we can rebuild the High Streets. ""I believe that customers still want to shop, still want to physically shop in stores, especially for fashions, and as we get further and further away from the pandemic, being able to try on clothes comfortably is what the customers are asking us to do."" The BRC's Ms Dickinson said that there is a sharp divide between the south of England, including London, with lower vacancy rates compared to the north of the country, where disposable income is lower. While the increase in the vacancy rate is slowing, there ""will never be enough demand to meet the supply"" said Lucy Stainton, director of Local Data Company, which did the vacancy research for the BRC. ""The property market will be forced to think of more creative ways to utilise this space, to avoid exacerbating the already high rates of long-term voids across our retail destinations which are not only unsightly and costly for landlords, but also have a negative impact on surrounding stores,"" she said. The BRC envisages future town centres to include leisure, retail centres, services and homes.

"The cancellation of some cancer surgeries is a ""direct effect"" of people not getting vaccinated against Covid, the Belfast Health Trust's medical director has said. On Wednesday the Trust announced it was cancelling some surgeries due to Covid-19 pressures. Dr Chris Hagan said those pressures were a result of rising infections due to unvaccinated people. He apologised and said rescheduling of the operations had started. He said about 24 patients were affected. The Health and Social Care Board's Paul Cavanagh later told Stormont's health committee that 120 surgeries of all types have been cancelled this week. Dr Hagan told BBC's Good Morning Ulster it was really important to highlight why this had happened. ""Last week we were sitting with about 50 Covid patients in our hospitals, that has now risen to over 100,"" he said. More surgeries cancelled as Covid admissions rise Belfast Trust to cancel some surgeries over Covid Hospital pressures mount as Covid-19 ICU numbers rise ""There is enormous pressure on our intensive care units with 10 patients in our intensive care, seven of whom are ventilated. ""It is really important we get that message across that not taking up vaccine is driving infection in the community and that choice not to get vaccinated is then leading on to direct effects like this."" He added: ""I just want to apologise that we have had to do this, it is a terrible thing to have to cancel people who are expecting surgery, at the last minute. ""But I want to reassure the public that we will try and reschedule all these operations as quickly as possible."" Meanwhile, Mr Cavanagh told the health committee about 1,800 healthcare staff in Northern Ireland were off work due to Covid. The head of the vaccination programme in Northern Ireland, Patricia Donnelly, told members of Stormont's health committee on Thursday that uptake among the 18-29 age group was ""incredibly slow"". She said it was a cause of ""enormous concern"" that the pace of the vaccination programme ""went off a cliff"" in June when it opened to this younger age group. Just under 60% of 18-29 year olds have received a first jab. The next lowest uptake rate is 70% for the 30-39 year olds. All the age cohorts over the age of 60 have a 100% uptake rate. She said while 90,000 people a week were getting vaccinated earlier in the roll-out, the programme has slowed to the extent where it would be ""lucky"" if 1,000 to 2,000 people were getting jabbed each day. Gareth Kirk said it was a ""critical situation"" and was ""cruel"" for cancer patients The chief executive of Action Cancer said he was ""sickened"" and ""disappointed"" by the surgery cancellations. Gareth Kirk said it was a ""critical situation"" and was ""cruel"" for cancer patients. ""That is hard, having got a cancer diagnosis, it is tough psychologically building up to the time of your surgery - your treatment is worrying and it is stressful and then to be led up probably to the top of the mountain and then taken down again is cruel,"" he said. Prof Mark Taylor, from the Royal College of Surgeons, said the postponement of ""potentially life-saving cancer surgeries"" was ""extremely worrying"". ""In May, we published an action plan for tackling NI's waiting times that focused on protecting planned surgery from future stoppages due to Covid-19 surges or winter flu season,"" he said. ""We called for greater investment, Covid-light sites and surgical hubs to help keep surgery going and spoke about patients and surgeons being ready to travel if it means getting surgery done quicker."" Cancer surgery is continuing in the Northern and Southern trusts, BBC News NI understands. But it is understood one cancer-related procedure due to take place in the South Eastern Trust area this week has also been cancelled. The Western Trust said it had to delay 39 procedures, but that no cancer surgeries had been cancelled. Of those 39, 38 have now either taken place or are booked for a new date. It comes just a month after Health Minister Robin Swann published a three-year recovery plan for rebuilding cancer services post-pandemic. Surgery in cancer can be time-critical - the speed at which a patient gets their procedure may have an impact on their prognosis. On Thursday, another 1,471 positive coronavirus cases were reported by the Department of Health - down from 1,600 on Wednesday. This includes samples taken in recent days, not necessarily in the past 24 hours. Two further deaths were also reported. There are 234 patients with a confirmed diagnosis of Covid-19 in hospitals in Northern Ireland. That figure is down from Wednesday's total of 244 patients. A spokesperson for the Department of Health said they ""deeply regret the rescheduling of any surgery and recognise the deep distress caused to patients"". They said the move was ""unavoidable"" given the rise in ICU occupancy and Covid-19 inpatients. The spokesperson said the department remained committed to the aim of maximising elective surgery across the region and the position would be kept under review.

"The number of self-isolation alerts sent by the NHS Covid-19 app in England and Wales has risen to a new record of 689,313 in the week up to 21 July. The figures represent an increase of over 70,000 compared with the previous week. But the rate of increase was lower than the previous week, rising by 11% compared to 17%. If you are ""pinged"" by the app you are advised - but not legally obliged - to self-isolate for 10 days. However the government has said it is crucial for people to do so. In recent weeks, there has been widespread criticism that the app has been sending out so many alerts that hundreds of thousands of people are self-isolating and missing work, causing widespread disruption. It ledto the government allowing some key workers- such as those working in food distribution - to be exempt from having to self-isolate if pinged. Instead they have to take daily tests. There are currently 260 testing sites open for these workers, Downing Street said on Thursday - and they are working to set up another 800. After that, 1,200 more sites will be opened ""over the coming days"". From 16 August, all fully-vaccinated people will not need to self-isolate if pinged by the app, although they will be encouraged to book a Covid PCR test. The impact on businesses has resulted in calls for the 16 August deadline to be brought forward. The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders is asking for urgent assistanceto exempt staff pinged by the NHS Covidapp saying pings are affecting production. Many in the hospitality industry also complained of shortages as staff had to self-isolate. Some bar staff have told the BBC that they've lost a lot of money by missing shifts, while others say they have been told to delete the app by their manager. Bar staff told to delete Covid app over pingdemic Covid app settings changing to send fewer alerts What are the self-isolation rules if I'm fully vaccinated? The app alert is advisory only and not enforceable by law, unlike a phone call from the NHS Test and Trace team. Latest data from Test and Trace shows that 14% of cases transferred to contact-tracers in the week to 21 July were not reached and so were unable to provide details of close contacts. This is the highest proportion of people not reached since October last year. England's deputy chief medical officer Prof Jonathan Van Tam said separate figures from Public Health England showed the vaccines have now prevented 22 million Covid cases and 60,000 deaths. He added it was ""truly massive"". If you were looking for evidence that the ""pingdemic"" is over you will struggle to find it in these statistics. The figure of nearly 690,000 contact tracing alerts - or pings - is a new record, up 11% on the previous week. They were triggered by nearly 148,000 positive test results entered in the app, up 25%. Despite the anecdotal evidence of people switching off or getting rid of the app, there is no sign yet of mass deletions. But there are a few straws in the wind suggesting things might be changing. The rate of increase in pings slowed, and the number of alerts triggered by each positive test result was down. That suggests that people who later became infected had fewer close contacts - either because they were socialising less or because those they encountered did not have the app. In the week when restrictions in England were relaxed so that venues did not need to record visitors' details, check-ins via the app were sharply lower. As they find they don't need it to check in, more people may decide the app is more trouble than it's worth. But the team which designed it believes the NHS Covid-19 app is changing behaviour in useful ways - even if someone ignores a ping's instruction to self isolate they may become more cautious, and anyone who has a holiday planned may be nudged into staying at home for a few days beforehand rather than having their plans spoiled by an alert. At first, it was criticised for being ineffective, in recent weeks it's been accused of disrupting thousands of businesses, but its designers believe this experimental technology is finally proving that it can be a useful weapon in controlling the pandemic. After a week of falling cases the number of people testing positive for coronavirus rose on Wednesday, when 27,734 new daily cases were reported. Health Secretary Sajid Javid said: ""The truth is, when it comes to case numbers no one really knows where they are going to go next"". People in England and Wales can download the NHS Covid app (Northern Ireland and Scotland have their own). If you are using the app and spend enough time close to another person with it, you will receive a ""ping"" alert if they later test positive for Covid-19 and share the information with the app. The app uses the Bluetooth signal to determine whether your phone had recently been within 2m of theirs for at least 15 minutes. If you are ""pinged"" you're advised - but not legally obliged - to self-isolate for up to 10 days. Separately to the NHS Covid app, there have also been changes to the NHS app, which among other things is used for Covid vaccination records. It has been updated to allow iPhone and iPad users to store their Covid Pass using the Apple Wallet app. This can be used at events and venues in England,but not for international travel,externalthe government says.

"Those travelling into Northern Ireland will have to be double vaccinated with accredited vaccines People who have been fully vaccinated in the EU or the US will not need to self-isolate when entering Northern Ireland from Monday. This easing of the Covid-19 travel rules is in line with changes made in England, Scotland and Wales. The Northern Ireland Executive also decided to allow international cruises to restart from 31 July. Students arriving from red-list countries will be put into managed isolation facilities. The pilot rollout for the expansion of the amber listed countries vaccinations policy is due to start on Monday 2 August. It means all those coming from the US or from EU countries (except France) will not have to isolate. There was also agreement that Villarreal football fans coming to Belfast for next month's Uefa Super Cup final against Chelsea would not have to self-isolate. A final decision to drop the wearing of masks in schools has also been delayed The executive has also agreed the 1m (3ft) social distancing regulation will be applied in indoor settings such as supermarkets and shopping centres from 18:00 BST on Friday 30 July. The 1m rule remains as guidance outdoors. What can I do as NI's Covid restrictions ease? It was also agreed that function rooms and community halls can put on live music from 30 July. Plans to reopen conferences and exhibitions have been delayed - that will be considered in August. A final decision to drop the wearing of masks in schools has also been delayed although earlier this month ministers said the wearing of face coverings may just be regarded as guidance when schools return. Since last August, post-primary pupils and teachers have been required to wear face coverings in school corridors and other communal areas. Earlier this week the executive agreed theatres and concert venues could reopen More discussions will take place between officials the Department of Health and the Department of Education. The proposals to ease restrictions at borders were discussed against a backdrop of increasing coronavirus-related pressures in Northern Ireland's hospitals. On Wednesday, BBC News NI reported thatsome cancer surgeries in Belfast were being cancelledin order to expand the number of staff caring for Covid-19 patients. The rule change on travel - which will come into force in England, Scotland and Wales from 04:00 on Monday - applies to people who have had both jabs of a vaccine approved by the EU or the US. Travellers will still need to take either a lateral flow or a PCR (polymerase chain reaction) test pre-departure and a PCR test on the second day after they arrive. Under-18s will be exempt from isolation and some will not have to test, depending on their age. The Department of Health confirmed itsCovid certification service,externalfor people travelling abroad will resume on Friday morning after it was ""temporarily interrupted"" by a technical problem. The interim system allows people from Northern Ireland to prove they are fully vaccinated against Covid-19 to countries which require it for entry. With the app still not available, applications can only be made online through the NIdirect website However, the service went offline on Tuesday,leaving many people concerned about their travel plans. On Thursday, the department said the system would go online again from 09:00 on Friday and should only be used by those travelling on Sunday 1 August ""in the first instance"". With the app still not available, applications can only be made online through the NIdirect website. Applications would be processed manually, the department added, with applicants contacted by email in response. The department said it was resuming the service in a ""controlled and phased way"" and explained that ""further communication"" would be issued on Friday in relation to people travelling after Sunday. On Thursday, another 1,471 positive coronavirus cases were reported by the Department of Health - down from 1,600 on Tuesday. That includes samples taken in recent days, not necessarily in the past 24 hours. Two more Covid-19-related deaths were also reported. Northern Ireland's chief medical officer Sir Michael McBride urged people to use the health service wisely. Earlier this week the executiveagreed that theatres and concert venues could reopen, after initially delaying its decision. On Monday, as well as agreeing to the reopening of theatres and concert venues, ministers backed further modest changes to the restrictions, including: An increase in the number of people who can meet indoors, with 10 people from three households being allowed to meet inside a home Fifteen people from unlimited households being allowed to meet outdoors Close-contact services being allowed to operate without the need for pre-booked appointments Executive agrees theatre and concert reopening No quarantine for fully jabbed EU and US arrivals What can I do as NI's Covid restrictions ease?

"Dairy giant Arla, which supplies milk to all major UK supermarkets, has said a lorry driver shortage has forced it to cut back on its deliveries. UK managing director Ash Amirahmadi said the firm normally supplied 2,400 stores a day, but had been experiencing driver shortages since early April. ""Last Saturday, there were 600 stores that we couldn't deliver milk to,"" he told the BBC. He warned of a summer of disruption and urged the government to act. ""It's very worrying for customers when they go into shops and find that the shelves are empty,"" he said. ""Our assessment is that we're in a driver shortage crisis and therefore we're asking for the industry and government to work together to recognise we're in a crisis and actually address the issue."" Mr Amirahmadi said the government could help the industry by accelerating the programme of driving tests for new HGV drivers, as well as by issuing temporary visas for the road haulage industry, so that more European drivers could be allowed into the country. The Road Haulage Association believes there is currently a shortfall of about 100,000 lorry drivers. Earlier this month, Transport Secretary Grant Shapps announceda temporary extension of lorry drivers' working hours, from nine to 10 hours a day. However, the RHA said the relaxation was a ""sticking plaster"". Mr Amirahmadi said: ""Since the beginning of April, we have experienced driver shortages. That has increased to such a level now that we are not able to deliver milk to every store that we'd like to. ""Unfortunately at the moment, there's about 10% of the stores every day that we can't deliver to. At the weekend, it's worse."" Mr Amirahmadi said the problem was a structural issue that needed a structural solution. He said it would be ""tough and challenging"" to get through the summer. There are indications that the shortage of drivers is pushing up pay rates, withTesco offering lorry drivers a Â£1,000 joining bonus. Arla, through third-party hauliers, had ""significantly increased"" pay, including paying new drivers a Â£2,000 bonus if they were prepared to work weekends, Mr Amirahmadi said. But with summer holidays approaching, the problem was likely to get worse, he said. ""By how much, we cannot fully predict, but I think that's why we really need to take bold action in time for the summer,"" he said. ""We're trying to avoid a summer of disruption."" The driver shortage has combined with the so-called ""pingdemic"" to exacerbate the problem, as large numbers of workers in key sectors have been forced to stay at home after being alerted by the NHS Covid app. But Arla was suffering more from the lack of drivers than from Covid alerts, Mr Amirahmadi said. ""Self-isolation doesn't seem to be impacting us as much, because we're a very mechanised, automated business,"" he added. ""The food is there in the factories, it's just about getting it to the shops. So that's our key problem."" A government spokesperson said: ""We're working with industry and have already taken action on HGV driver shortages, including ramping up vocational test capacity, and funding apprenticeships. ""We have also announced a temporary relaxation of drivers' hours rules. This will allow HGV drivers to make slightly longer journeys, but must only be used where necessary and must not compromise driver safety, with further measures to be announced shortly. ""Most of the solutions, however, are likely to be driven by industry, with progress already being made in testing and hiring, and a big push towards improving pay, working conditions and diversity.""

"Dating app Bumble has said its 700 employees can take unlimited paid leave providing their manager approves it. It is understood that the unlimited holiday is contingent on staff still managing to complete their work. The move comes after the firmtemporarily closed its offices in June for a weekto combat workplace stress. The new leave policy was announced alongside a series of other changes, including a plan to shut the office for a week two times a year. Bumble said the pandemic had made it ""reflect on"" the ways staff worked and prompted the change in approach. ""It's becoming increasingly clear that the way that we work, and need to work, has changed and our new policies are a reflection of what really matters and how we can best support our teams in both their work and life,"" said Bumble president Tariq Shaukat. Bumble said when the firm shuts down, some customer staff across its offices in Austin, Barcelona, London and Moscow will still work in case any of the app's users experience issues. All Bumble staff given week off to de-stress The tech billionaire who is putting women first A year of working from home and juggling childcare when schools were closed and other responsibilities mounted, has prompted many businesses to look again at the traditional working week. Accountancy firmPrice WaterhouseCooper said earlier this yearthat staff would be able to work from home a couple of days a week and start as early or late as they wanted. The building society Nationwide also told its staff they can choose whether to work at home or in the office. Oil giant BP has told office staff they can spend two days a week working from home and several banks are examining hybrid home-office arrangements. Pre-pandemic some small firms already offered staff unlimited leave, including theoboss of Virgin Group, Sir Richard Branson, who offered his 170 personal staff as much holiday as they wanted. But critics say it can backfire, with staff actually taking less holiday as a result. This video can not be played CEO Secrets: Bumble founder Whitney Wolfe says don't take yourself too seriously Ben Gately, chief operating officer at UK software firm CharlieHR, ended up offering staff other benefits such as more flexible working hours instead. ""People didn't take enough [holiday],""Ben Gately told the BBC at the time. ""People are pretty bad at taking holiday, we're all scared to do it because we have to do our handovers and pass stuff over and meet deadlines. ""There's a huge amount of anxiety about not knowing the limit. A bunch of our team came to us and said: 'Actually we'd love to know where the line is. Is it okay to take 35 days? Is it okay to take 25 days? Where should I draw the line?' Because the reality is that it's not actually unlimited."" Bumble has said it's also offering staff additional types of paid leave including 20 days for staff who are victims of domestic violence and other violent crimes and a minimum of 15 days bereavement leave for miscarriages. Dating app Bumble tops $13bn in market debut Tinder to introduce in-app background checks Lisa King OBE, director of communications and external relations at domestic abuse charity Refuge, told the BBC more workplaces needed to be empathetic to employees who may be experiencing domestic abuse. ""Domestic abuse is the biggest social issue impacting women and children and it's great to see that companies are beginning to recognise this and place it at the centre of their policies. We hope that other companies follow their lead,"" she continued. Whitney Wolfe Herd launched Bumble in Texas in 2014 Bumble has had a busier year than most firms, with a stock market debut, and rapid growth in user numbers. With lockdown restrictions, the dating app saw a the number of paid users across Bumble and Badoo, which Bumble also owns, up by 30% to 2.8 million, in thethree months to 31 March,external, compared with the same period last year. Its founder Whitney Wolfe Herd also became the youngest woman, at 31, to take a company public in the US when she oversaw Bumble's stock market debut in February. Bumble shares however, have shed 25% since the company's initial public offering in February. Ms Wolfe Herd also co-founded dating app Tinder, but left the firm alleging sexual harassment. Tinder's parent company Match Group Inc, which denied the claims and later tried unsuccessfully to acquire Bumble, paid about $1m to settle the dispute. The company has 42 million monthly users in over 150 countries and recently announced plans for a new cafÃ© and wine bar in New York.

"This video can not be played Two people have an accident or medical problem causing paralysis by spinal cord injury every week in Northern Ireland. Will Doggart from Bangor, County Down, sustained a spinal cord injury 11 years ago. He said: ""After my A-levels I went on holiday with my friends and on the last night I jumped in the sea and hit the top of my head on a sandbank and I was instantly paralysed. ""Iâm paralysed from my chest and have impaired movement in my arms and donât have any hand functions."" Will is now working for the spinal cord injury charity, Aspire. It has been funded by the National Lottery Community Fund to provide an independent living service to patients at Belfastâs Musgrave Park Hospital. âI can see myself in a lot of the people in there; whether that's their frustration, anger or lack of motivation sometimes. ""My job is to offer practical help to people who are going through injuries, whether that's advice on welfare or on housing and financial help."" The 29-year-old and his wife are expecting their first child at the end of September. He added: ""My main message is that life doesnât stop just because you have a spinal injury."" The number of people being injured or diagnosed each year in the UK with a spinal cord injury is estimated to be about 2,500.

"University students will get ""advance warning"" if they are required to have vaccines before moving to halls of residence, Dominic Raab has said. The foreign secretary said decisions will be taken in September - but he was keen to encourage vaccine uptake. More than 70% of adults have now had both jabs, and Mr Raab said ""we need to close that margin"". Currently, the government plans to require two jabs to go to nightclubs and other crowded venues in England. The full details of the plan are yet to be seen, but the rule is set to come into force at the end of September. An NHS Covid Pass - which you can obtain electronically or as a letter - will be used as proof. How can I prove I've had both my jabs? Covid: Have we passed the peak and can we relax? How many people have been vaccinated so far? Mr Raab was asked on BBC Radio 4's Today programme whether the government was in favour of going further and making the vaccine pass compulsory in more settings. ""I think the key principle is in crowded places where we want to open up... whether it's going to a football game or pop concert, we want to make sure people can do that,"" he said. And asked whether they were planning to require students in university halls to get vaccinated, Mr Raab said: ""When we come to the crunch, these decisions will be taken in September. We've got some time to go. ""Right the way through this pandemic we've had to take advice and decisions based on the evidence when we see it. ""We will certainly make sure university students have advance warning, of course we're going to be mindful of this."" He said he had recently visited France, where they had a big surge in vaccinations after bringing in a health pass for many activities. ""It's a little bit of coaxing and cajoling and also making clear that ultimately over September when we know we'll see, as a result of coming out of the lockdown step four, an increase in cases, we can control that with backstop safeguard measures."" Latest government figures show that more than 71% of adults have now had two jabs, while 88% have had a first dose. Young people who are within three months of turning 18 - meaning those who are soon able to go to university - and those aged 12-17 who live with people who have a suppressed immune system, can now also get a jab. The idea to make vaccines compulsory for university students - either to attend lectures or to live in halls of residence - was not ruled out by either education minister Vicky Ford or Downing Street when asked about it earlier this week. ""We are still looking at the scope for vaccination certifications,"" a No 10 spokesman said on Monday. It is not clear if any rule, if it happens, would apply just to England or be adopted by the whole of the UK - the governments of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland are in charge of their own coronavirus rules and education is devolved. Earlier this week, the trade union for academic staff such as lecturers, criticised the idea following news reports. ""Students should be prioritised for vaccinations, to ensure as many as possible have the opportunity to be vaccinated by September,"" said the University and College Union. ""But making vaccinations compulsory as a condition to access their education is wrong and would be hugely discriminatory against those who are unable to be vaccinated, and international students."" The National Union of Students also called the idea ""appalling"", saying there has been ""no consultation whatsoever with the sector"". ""All the students I speak with are incredibly eager to get their vaccinations - if anything they would like them bringing forwards so that they've had both doses before term begins,"" said president Larissa Kennedy. She accused the government of ""lining students up as scapegoats"", describing it as ""finger pointing nonsense"". Both Labour and leading universities have called for vaccination centres to be set up on campuses so that students are jabbed before the winter. The Russell Group - made up of the UK's top universities - has offered its own spaces and facilities to be used as pop-up centres. Are you affected by issues covered in this story?

"Downing Street has insisted it is ""crucial"" to self-isolate when sent an alert by the Covid app - and businesses should help employees to do so. It comes after business minister Paul Scully said he would encourage people who are ""pinged"" to self-isolate but they can make an ""informed decision"". The app has always been voluntary to download and any alerts are advisory. Labour accused the government of ""making it up as they go along"" and creating confusion. In recent days, there has been widespread criticism that the app has been sending out so many alerts that hundreds of thousands of people are self-isolating and missing work, causing widespread disruption. Pub chains, supermarkets, transport networks and other businesses have warned of the crippling effect blanket stay-at-home orders for close contacts were having on their operations. People who are ""pinged"" by the NHS Covid app and told they have been in close contact with someone with coronavirus are advised - but not legally obliged - to self-isolate for 10 days. However, anyone contacted directly byNHS Test and Trace,external- either by phone, text or email - must self-isolate. On Tuesday, the UK reported a further 46,558 new daily Covid cases alongside another 96 deaths within 28 days of a positive test. What happens if I'm 'pinged' by the app? Who could leave self-isolation to go to work? Meanwhile, a ""very small"" number of critical workers - including NHS and care staff - could carry on working even if told to self-isolate under a new government scheme. Industry bodiesreacted to the plan with dismay, describing it as ""simply unworkable"", amid confusion over how it would operate. Downing Street confirmed the first exemptions had been issued under the scheme by government departments. No 10 was unable to say how many people the government will approve for the loosened rules. Plans for the fully vaccinated to be made exempt from self-isolation were delayed until 16 August in England,with ministers warning at the time of a huge knock-onfor the economy and workplaces, including the NHS. In a BBC interview, Mr Scully was asked whether people should self-isolate if they are ""pinged"". ""I would absolutely encourage people to do that. But they can make an informed decision,"" he replied. ""I don't want to have to mandate people and tell people what to do as government any longer than I really have to. ""But they do have a responsibility to themselves, to their families and to their communities. It's by doing the right thing that we can keep Covid at bay."" Who could leave self-isolation to go to work? Should I be working at home or going in? Earlier, he told Times Radio that self-isolating after being told to by the app was a decision for individuals and employers. ""It's important to understand the rules,"" he said. ""You have to legally isolate if you are... contacted by Test and Trace, or if you're trying to claim isolation payments. The app is there to allow you to make informed decisions."" The Times is also reporting thatministers have written to major manufacturers,externalemphasising that staff are not legally obliged to isolate if ""pinged"". Investment minister Lord Grimstone told one large employer the app was only an ""advisory tool"" and that people were not under any ""legal duty"", the paper said. Following the ministers' comments, Downing Street attempted to clarify the government's position, insisting isolation remained the ""most important action"" people can take to stop the spread of the virus. ""Given the risk of having and spreading the virus when people have been in contact with someone with Covid, it is crucial people isolate when they are told to do so, either by NHS Test and Trace or by the NHS Covid app,"" a No 10 spokeswoman said. ""Businesses should be supporting employees to isolate, they should not be encouraging them to break isolation."" Now that legal restrictions have been lifted in England, cases of coronavirus will undoubtedly rise further. But a significant number of adults are not yet fully vaccinated. In the meantime, the test and trace system remains the only way the government can contain the virus to a level it deems acceptable. So the message on how closely people should follow the advice to isolate if ""pinged"" by the app is crucial. Although it's not a legal requirement to do so (only if contacted directly by test and trace) any suggestion that it's up to you, optional, or a judgement call risks undermining the government's entire approach. That's why we saw a junior minister's choice of words was quickly corrected by Downing Street this morning. The rules change next month, allowing double jabbed adults to avoid isolation. Until then the government will have to hope it can keep the public's confidence in the app and its instructions to isolate. John Edmunds, professor of infectious diseases at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and a member of Sage, said contact tracing and self-isolation should be maintained ""as stringently as we can"". ""We have one of the highest rates of cases in the world right now. The NHS has been under strain for a long time and they are busy trying to catch up on operations and are very, very busy. So to put them under more pressure now is going to be awkward,"" he told Times Radio. Justin Madders, Labour's shadow health minister, accused the government of ""making it up as they go along"". ""Yet again there is more confusion and incompetence from the heart of government at the expense of public health. They need to get a grip,"" he said. While the Covid app can only advise people to self-isolate, anyone in England who is called, texted or emailed by NHS Test and Trace must isolate for 10 days. Failure to self-isolate for the full time period can result in a fine, starting from Â£1,000.

"Joseph had run his own business for years and had built up a tidy sum in savings for retirement. He planned to use the money to buy a mortgage-free bungalow for him and and his wife to live out the rest of their days. In a bid to top-up those savings he was drawn into investing online - a move into cryptocurrency trading that left him at the mercy of suspected fraudsters and drained his life savings. ""My wife and I are very upset,"" he said. ""We have lost our lifestyle and our plans."" Fears over risk-taking by cryptoasset investors Bid to use criminal cash to refund scam victims Joseph is not his real name. He is in his 70s and feels vulnerable and distraught about what happened. ""I wanted to do this online trading as everyone was saying how good it was, to give us a better lifestyle,"" he said. Assuming he was making profits, he was drawn into a cycle of investing more in order to get money out. The scammers said they needed 10% from him to get his money out. He said he was ill, and collapsed while on the phone and they were still on the line when paramedics arrived. During his illness, he kept getting text messages asking for more funds. He was confused and agreed to hand over more money and eventually lost more than Â£250,000 in life savings. Banks have been issuing warnings about fraudulent cryptocurrency trading, and are unlikely to refund any of his losses. ""I thought I was good with my money. It was really when I came out of hospital that the shock of what I'd done hit me,"" Joseph said. ""The money was for our retirement and any future healthcare we needed. I have no means to recoup the money I've lost as I'm retired."" Citizens Advice said that 36 million adults had been targeted by a scammer so far this year. Of those, 12% were by someone offering a fake investment or get-rich-quick scheme. ""Scams come in many guises, whether it be a get-rich-quick scheme or the promise of romance. It's easy to think it'll never happen to you, but the reality is anyone can be targeted and anyone can be tricked,"" said Matthew Upton, director of policy at the charity. A host of charities have been calling for scam adverts to be included in the government'sOnline Safety Bill, which will soon be scrutinised by MPs and Lords. One of those, the Money and Mental Health Policy Institute, said that millions of internet users, particularly those with mental health problems, were in danger of losing money or sensitive personal information to scammers. It said there were also risks of confusion as technology companies would be expected to remove some scams from their websites, but not others. Martin Lewis, who founded the charity, said: ""The UK is facing an epidemic of scam adverts. Our advertising rules were set up to police soap manufacturers making false cleanliness claims, not to tackle sophisticated, psychologically adept, digital organised crime, based around the world. ""This has left many scammers untraced, un-investigated, and unpunished. Many get away with these crimes with impunity.""

"Around 60,000 deaths have been prevented in England as a result of the Covid vaccine programme, the deputy chief medical officer has said. Prof Jonathan Van-Tam said an estimated 22 million cases have also been stopped - a ""truly massive"" success. His comments came in a special programme with Radio 1 Newsbeat listeners, including some who are worried about getting a jab. He said the more people get a jab, the less likely more lockdowns are. Bar staff told to delete Covid app over pingdemic How many under-30s are unvaccinated? Covid: Have we passed the peak and can we relax? The chances of another lockdown will be ""much lower"" if a higher proportion of the population, including 18-25-year-olds, get their jabs, he said. Nearly a third of young adults in England - about 2.7 million - have not had a first dose of a Covid-19 vaccine, NHS England figures show. Some 68.1% of people aged 18 to 29 had received a first dose by 25 July, according to estimates, meaning 31.9% are likely to not be jabbed. Prof Van-Tam also said he can't know yet if there will be a fourth wave of Covid infections in the UK. He disputed a claim made to a newspaper by a senior minister earlier this week that Covid was ""all over bar the shouting"", after a recent sharp drop in cases. Prof Van-Tam said: ""I wish it were so. This is not 'all over bar the shouting'. ""I hope the worst is behind us but I think it's quite possible that we're going to have one or two bumpy periods in the autumn and in the winter, not only through Covid, but also through flu and other respiratory viruses as well."" The estimate of 60,000 deaths avoided because of the vaccine, mentioned by Prof Van-Tam,comes from Public Health England (PHE),external, and was published shortly after he shared it with Newsbeat. This figure is a bit of an exaggeration. That's because it asks what would happen in a world with no vaccination and no new lockdowns. But it shouldn't be surprising for such a model to suggest that vaccines could have saved many tens of thousands of lives in England alone. The modellers behind the figure looked at the number of infections we've seen since the start of the year. They then asked how many of those infected people would have died if the death rates from 2020 still applied. That alone could account for thousands of deaths. Vaccines are also thought to have directly averted more than 52,600 hospital admissions, according to PHE. Previous estimates, for the period up to 9 July, had suggested about 37,000 deaths and 11 million infections had been prevented. A further 85 people in the UK have died within 28 days of a positive Covid test, according to thegovernment's latest daily figures.,external Another 31,117 cases of coronavirus were reported in the UK on Thursday, lower than the 39,906 cases reported a week earlier. Among those asking Prof Van-Tam questions was Sharnie, 19, a student in Coventry. She asked why someone like her who has had Covid - and only experienced mild cold and flu symptoms - should have a jab when she doesn't know the long-term effects of it. ""If there was anything very major going on in terms of side effects and long-term consequences we would have seen those signals and we just haven't,"" Prof Van-Tam said. He added that in the future it could get more difficult for those who haven't been vaccinated to access certain venues and go on holiday.

"Cecil Griffiths is Wales' youngest Olympic track and field gold medallist He is one of Britain's youngest ever Olympic champions but Cecil Griffiths died in poverty, so much so he was laid to rest in an unmarked grave. Griffiths was just 20 when he triumphed in the 4x400m relay at the 1920 Antwerp Games and one headline screamed he was 'The Best Runner Wales has Produced'. But he was ""robbed"" of a shot at competing at the 1924 ""Chariots of Fire"" Olympics after a lifetime ban. Now his granddaughter is raising money to get him the headstone ""he deserves"". Griffiths, from Neath in south Wales, was just 20 when the former Territorial Army volunteer travelled to Belgium for his first - and what would become his only - Olympic Games in 1920. Illness forced the Surrey Athletics Club member out of the individual 400m event, but he starred in the relay and helped Britain win their first of just two 4x400m relay Olympic titles. How swimmer went from garden pool to Olympic gold Simone Biles: 'I am more than my accomplishments' The young blind footballer backed by star players Griffiths built up an impressive lead in the first leg and his biographer John Hanna saying: ""I have a newspaper article with the headline in The Times that reads 'The Best Runner Wales has Produced'."" Griffiths followed up his Olympic success with British half-mile titles in 1923 and 1925 and remained in the top three for nine years - but he would never compete for Great Britain at the Olympics again. This video can not be played Olympic gold medal win a ""marvellous achievement"" for Cecil Griffiths In 1923, the Amateur Athletic Association imposed a lifetime ban on him after discovering he accepted cash prizes - totalling Â£3 - as a teenager, which contravened their rules. His biographer, also Griffiths' grandson-in-law, believes this ""robbed"" him of the chance of adding to his Olympic tally in the 1924 Paris Olympics which was immortalised in the film Chariots of Fire. In 1931, facing financial hardship in the Great Depression, Griffiths sold all his medals and trophies apart from his Olympic gold. An old newspaper clipping shows Griffiths talking to the King after a race Cecil Griffiths went on to become the British champion in the half-mile distance in 1923 and 1925 When he died aged 45 in 1945 in London, fianncial hardship meant his family were unable to afford a headstone for the former Olympic champion's grave at St. Lawrence's Church in Edgware. Now his granddaughter Vanessa Hanna, who has terminal cancer, is determined to place a headstone at the unmarked grave of the Olympic gold medallist before she dies. The 66-year-old, who is in the late stages ofrhabdomyosarcoma,external, said her grandfather never recovered from the ban. His family still has Cecil Griffith's Olympic gold medal from 1920 ""I feel it was cruel when he was banned from the Olympics, he went into a deep depression afterwards,"" she said. ""He was robbed because he could have achieved so much more and I feel that now about myself being robbed of my life, because of cancer it has robbed me of a normal life with my husband and grandchildren."" Only one Welsh athlete has won Olympics track and field gold since he and Jack Ainsworth-Davis struck gold as part of the 4x400m relay team with Griffiths in Antwerp in 1920 - with just four Welsh Olympic track and field golds in history. The Antwerp Olympics were the first to take place after the First World War Last year, on the 100th anniversary of her grandfather's Olympic win, Mrs Hanna decided to take action. ""I feel very strongly he should definitely be remembered,"" she said. ""It means a great deal to me I've always felt so proud of him from a very early age."" Mrs Hanna said she had fond memories of taking his gold medal into school when she was aged six during the 1964 Tokyo Olympics- and believes a headstone is important for future generations: ""He's always been in my heart,"" she said. ""We want to recognise that he existed and give him a grand memorial forever more so our grandchildren can go there and pay their respects in a civilised way. Vanessa Hanna and her husband John believe Cecil Griffiths should get more recognition ""I too realise now it's important for something like that to be at his grave so the family can visit and say hello when you've died and pay their respect."" Mr Hanna said he had regularly been beating the so-called 'Chariots of Fire' athletes from Oxford and Cambridge and the ban was a way for British athletics bosses to prevent the working class Welshman from competing. ""It was an era when sport was governed by the upper classes and this was a way for the AAA to get Cecil out of their hair,"" he said. ""He won Â£1 prize money when he was just 17 running in a charity event for the home guard in his hometown in Neath. ""A month later he took part in a race in Swansea and that was logged - he won Â£2 in that race which for his family would have been incredibly important."" Mr Hanna, 66, said Griffiths' father died when he was eight-years-old so in a time with no social security and the prize money would have been critical for his mother and two siblings. ""Six years later, the powers that be found this information out when he started to beat their Oxford and Cambridge athletes and they used this against him and banned him at the end of 1923."" The family have kept news cuttings about their Olympian relative He believes the ban stopped Griffiths from becoming a household name. ""He was described in a national paper as the best runner Wales has ever produced and I think that can still be argued today,"" he said. ""Only a few weeks before the 1924 Olympics, Cecil beat Douglas Lowe in the half mile race... he beat Lowe comfortably but with Cecil banned, Lowe went on to win gold at the Paris Olympics in the half mile. ""He could have run in the relay too so I believe he could have won a further two medals if he'd been allowed to compete and that would have put Cecil Griffiths right at the top of the league of British athlete's medal tally in track and field.""

" How high might temperatures climb and how much rain might fall in your area and how? The BBC and the Met Office have looked at the UK's changing climate in detail to find out. Temperatures in the UK exceeded 40C for the first time on record earlier this summer, and extreme weather events are likely to become even more frequent. The Met Office climate projections cover different levels of global warming. When, or if, these levels are reached will depend on the concentration of greenhouse gases in our atmosphere. The data is measured in 12km-square (7.5-mile-square) grids across the UK. The results for your postcode represent an average for the grids closest to you and the mid-point of a range of future possibilities, which come from the Met Office’s most recent major climate modelling data.

The hottest day recorded in the UK came in July 2022, with40.3C measured in at Coningsby in Lincolnshire. Human activity has increased carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions and caused rising temperatures worldwide since the growth of industrialisation in the 19th Century. If global average temperatures rise by 2C above pre-industrial levels, days at least as hot the 2019 record could be more frequent and widespread. And with a 4C rise, parts of the UK could see temperatures above 42C. Urgent cuts in emissions are needed to keep the rise in global average temperatures in check. The Glasgow Climate Pact,reached at the COP26 summit in 2021, agreed countries will meet this year to pledge further cuts to emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2). This is to try to keep temperature rises within 1.5C - which scientists say is required to prevent a ""climate catastrophe"". Current pledges, if met, will only limit global warming to about 2.4C.

If global temperatures rise by 2C, there could be {{beginHighlight}}{{medium_summer_days}} days{{endHighlight}}. With a 4C rise, there could be {{beginHighlight}}{{high_summer_days}} days{{endHighlight}}. The World Meteorological Organization (WMO) defines any day with a maximum temperature above 25C as a ""summer day"". In the 30 summers from 1991 to 2019, even the warmest places in the UK, located in the South, had no more than seven days a month above 25C on average. If global average temperatures rise by 2C, southern parts of the country could see more than 11 days per summer month go beyond 25C. If the rise is 4C, those places could have 20 or more summer days per month, and higher likelihood of hot spells triggering public-health warnings. The cooler, northern parts of the UK, which may not see many days above 25C even with a 4C rise, can nonetheless expect average daytime temperatures in summer to increase by at least 2.5C. The average daytime temperature in the UK in summercurrentlyranges from about 14C in northern Scotland to 22C in southern England.But summers have been getting warmer, with four of the 10 hottest summers up to 2019 recorded in the past two decades. Even if countries cut emissions and theworld warms by 2C, the whole UK could see higher summer temperatures.In some northern locations, the increase could be small. In southern areas, average summer temperatures could reach 24C. If emissions continue to increase and average global temperaturesrise by 4C, summers will be even hotter.Nearly a third of the UK could see average summer temperatures above 25C. The Met Office climate projections for the UK indicate significant temperature rises in the decades ahead for both winter and summer, with the greatest increases in the already warmer South. Extreme weather could become more frequent and intense. Not every summer will be hotter than the last – but temperature records are expected to be regularly broken, while heatwaves are likely to be longer and happen more often.

At both 2C and 4C rises, the number of rainy days per month could be roughly the same. As the world warms, fewer rainy days in summer are expected. Currently, over a quarter of the UK has 20 or more days without rain each summer month. This could grow to more than half the country if we reach 4C global warming. Winter rains could remain as likely as they are now. The number of days will vary from year-to-year, but rainy days in a warmer future could be wetter than today with total rainfall expected to rise. Use buttons to change season   In warmer winters the heaviest rains are likely to get more intense. If global average temperatures rise by 4C above pre-industrial levels, half the country could expect at least 20% more rainfall on the wettest winter days. Summer rains may also become heavier in many places, although total rainfall is expected to decline. Of course, not all of the heaviest rains will necessarily fall in these two seasons. The current wettest day on record was 3 October 2020, whenenough rain fell across all four nations to fill Loch Ness. Currently,the wettest areas of the UK dominate the west coast, with nearly all of Wales and western Scotland receiving most rain in winter months. So how much will change in future winters? With a2C rise, very little compared to what we've seen recently.But winters over the past 30 years have been rainier on average than previously, and the pattern of wetter winters could continue. The exact amount of change in rainfall at2C global warmingwill vary across the country. Most places could have slightly wetter winters than in the 20th Century. If global average temperatures were torise by 4C, more than half the country could see at least 10% more rain over the winter months. The UK climate projections suggest increases in winter rainfall in most parts of the country, as well as drier summers. Rainfall measurements fluctuate from year to year, making projections challenging. Not every winter will necessarily be rainier than the one before, and not every summer will be dry, but both trends could have big impacts. As the world warms, the UK is likely to have hotter, drier summers and warmer, wetter winters, according to the Met Office. Extreme weather events such as heatwaves and heavy downpours could become more frequent and more intense. Many scientists are concerned. ""I think it’s really frightening,” says Dr Lizzie Kendon, a senior Met Office scientist. “It's just a wake-up call really as to what we’re talking about here.” We are already seeing the impacts of climate change, but the level of global warming we reach and by when will depend primarily on the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. To some, warming weather may not seem like such a big deal. But even the smallest incremental changes in climate can have far-reaching effects. Temperatures above 30C for two or more days can trigger a public-health warning. In the 1990s, this happened about once every four years for locations in the South. By the 2070s, projections suggest it could be as frequently as four times per year - 16 times more often, if we do not curb our emissions. The Met Office projects rainy winters, which keep the soil wet into spring, and dry summers of infrequent rainfall will become the norm. Summer rain is likely to become less frequent but could be heavier. Without regular rainfall, the ground has a harder time absorbing water when it finally does come, leading to a greater risk of flash flooding. Floods will likely become a staple of warming winters as well. Steady rain, which is currently a feature of winter months, will probably continue, and total rainfall is expected to increase. When the ground is already saturated, waterways tend to rise. Bridges and sewers designed for historical rainfall levels may come increasingly under pressure. Warming temperatures could also mean cold spells become less frequent. Andsnowy UK winters could become thing of the pastas climate change affects the UK, according to Met Office analysis shared with BBC Panorama. Temperatures below freezing during the day and areas with considerable amounts of snow on the ground may be limited to parts of Scotland by the end of the century if emissions continue to rise. The BBC has collaborated with scientists from the Met Office to analyse data from their extensive weather measurement records and their major climate modelling project, theUK Climate Projections (UKCP). The present-day data shows averages of observed measurements for 1991-2019. The future data shows projected temperature and rainfall measurements produced by climate models for two different levels of global warming: if global average temperatures rise 2C above records from the mid-19th Century, the start of major industrialisation, and if that rise is 4C. Twelve different versions of the Met Office's Hadley Centre climate model were used in calculating the UKCP Regional (12km) projections using a high emissions gas scenario (RCP8.5). Climate models are computer simulations of how the atmosphere, oceans, land, plants and ice behave under various levels of atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations. They help scientists come up with projections for what conditions on Earth we are likely to see as global warming continues. The level of global warming depends on a number of factors. The most important is the amount of emissions produced in the coming years. Emissions are greenhouse gases released into our atmosphere. The accumulation of these gases has a warming effect on the globe, which in turn leads to changes in climatic conditions. Governments around the world have pledged to reduce their emissions to limit the degree of warming. During the Glasgow COP26 summit in 2021, countries agreed to meet the following year to pledge further major carbon cuts with the aim of keeping temperature rises within 1.5C above pre-industrial levels. If global temperatures rise by more than 1.5C, scientists say the Earth is likely to experience severe effectssuch as millions more people being exposed to extreme heat. If no interventions are taken, global average temperatures could rise by up to 4C by 2100. This high-emissions future is highlighted in themost recent Evidence Report for the UK's Climate Change Risk Assessment (CCRA)as possible, if less likely. Current pledges, if met, will only limit global warming to about 2.4C, while at current rates of global emissions, the world is on a pathway somewhere between 2C and 4C. The modelled projections in this data do not represent a specific time period. Instead, they show what conditions could be like in these two different levels of global warming. Some other climate data may project specific points in time by which a certain level of global warming may be reached. However, this model allows for the possibility of actions that may reduce or increase emissions enough to change the timing before we would experience a 2C or 4C future. More information on the methods used to calculate the timing of different levels of global warming can be found inthis 2018 Met Office paper. This tool presents six different measurements among those scientists use to gain a picture of the environment under various conditions. Each represents a specific predefined climate metric. 1. Hottest day is the maximum temperature recorded or projected on a single day 2. Summer days, as defined by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), have a maximum temperature above 25C 3. Average daytime temperature is the average of daily maximum air temperatures over a season 4. Rainy days are when more than 1mm of rain is recorded. This excludes days that may have had very light rain or a heavy morning dew or mist 5. Wettest day is the maximum amount of recorded or projected rainfall on a single day 6. Total rainfall is the amount in millimetres measured across a season. We also calculated and display the change in rainfall for the future scenarios as a percentage change from the current period (1991-2019) Climate data is typically presented in gridded squares that make up a large surface area. The grids used in this model are 12km by 12km. This level of detail is able to capture many of the varied climate conditions across the UK's diverse geography far better than other, broader-scale models. Each UK postcode has been matched to its nearest 12km-square grid. The results displayed for your area represent an average (mean) for the grids closest to that location, as long as they are no further than 34km away. In most cases a grid has been averaged with its eight nearest grids, except along irregular coastlines and small islands. Averaging means that the figures displayed are never for a single grid alone. While natural variability between grid areas is normal, this process minimises dramatic differences that may be down to chance. Both current and future data are organised into the same 12km-square grids. However, unlike future modelled predictions, the present-day data comes from actual observed measurements. We have presented a single number that represents an average for each grid and season. This helps to reduce the influence of outliers in observed data. For instance, the current number of summer days represents the mean number of days recording maximum temperatures of at least 25C per month in June, July and August across every year from 1991 to 2019. Each number presented in the two future scenarios represents the median of 12 possible outcomes as projected by the 12 model simulations. All future projection data has been calibrated by Met Office scientists against the data in the present-day range, 1991-2019, so the model results can be compared directly with observations. More information on the calibration technique used can be foundin this 2017 paper. Because climate data is gridded, the data may represent a larger area than that covered by a single weather station. Measurements from multiple weather stations are averaged together to give a single datapoint for a grid. Take the hottest day, for instance. If the highest temperature recorded at Cambridge Royal Botanic Gardens was 38.7C, that number is combined with measurements from other stations across the region to produce an average for a 12km-square area that includes Cambridge. Other weather stations will have recorded slightly lower temperatures, so the average highest temperature in this area would be less than 38.7C.

"Simon Cowell's show The X Factor ran from 2004-2018 but has not been seen since ITV have confirmed they have ""no plans"" for another series of The X Factor. The last full series of Simon Cowell's pop music TV talent show aired in 2018, although a celebrity edition was broadcast the following year. During its peak in the late noughties, the X Factor was one of the most popular TV shows in the UK. However, ratings have fallen in recent years. An ITV spokesman told the BBC: ""There are no current plans for the next series of The X Factor at this stage."" A report in The Sun,externalclaimed the show will be rested for at least five years. The X Factor first aired in 2004 and judges on the show have included Sharon Osbourne, Louis Walsh, Cheryl, and Nicole Scherzinger. A US version of the show ran for three seasons from 2011-2013. In 2019,ITV signed a deal with Cowellto broadcast Britain's Got Talent until at least 2024, but did not commit to keeping The X Factor past 2020. The singing competition regularly attracted an audience of more than 10 million a decade ago, withmore than 17 million viewers tuning into see Matt Cardle crowned the winner of the 2010 series. Louis Walsh, Sharon Osbourne and Simon Cowell during Ireland auditions for The X Factor in 2004 But ratings fell in subsequent years. In 2018, an average of 5.3 million people watched Dalton Harris crowned the winner, when the judges were Louis Tomlinson, Robbie Williams and Ayda Field. The show was absent in 2019, with a celebrity edition taking its place and in early 2020 it was revealed that Cowell was to give it another year off. Last month, it was revealed the music mogul's attentions have now turned to leading a fresh panel of judges in an upcoming new ITV musical game show, entitled Walk The Line. One Direction in 2011 on the X Factor Live Tour at London's Wembley Arena While many people down the years walked away from the early rounds of The X Factor broken-hearted, a coterie of successful contestants have enjoyed brilliant showbiz careers off the back of the show. One Directionfinished third in series seven of the show in 2010, and subsequently signed to Cowell's label Syco. After dominating the charts with four number one singles and albums, all five former members of the boyband - Niall Horan, Liam Payne, Harry Styles, Louis Tomlinson and Zayn Malik (who left the band in 2015) have gone on to enjoy solo careers. Leona Lewisis the second best-selling act to come out of the show after 1D. The Bleeding Love singer has sold more than 30 million records worldwide and been nominated for several Brit and Grammy awards. She made her Broadway debut in 2016, as Grizabella, in Andrew Lloyd Webber's musical Cats. Little Mixrose to fame in 2011 as the first girl group to win the UK version of the show. They have gone on to score a plethora of hit singles including five number ones. They won a raft of Brit Awards, including best group at this year's ceremony.They split from Syco recordsin 2018, days before the release of their album LM5, with Cowell saying it was down to him having fallen out with their management company. Jesy Nelson left the band in December. Little Mix followed One Direction on to the Syco Records roster Olly Mursfinished second in the sixth series of The X Factor in 2009. He went on to have four UK number one singles and albums (the same as 1D, incidentally), before moving into the world of TV presenting. Murs hosted the spin-off show The Xtra Factor, alongside the late Caroline Flack. The pair also presented the main series in 2015. Since 2018, he has been a coach on The Voice UK. Rylan Clark-Nealfinished fifth place in the nine series of X Factor, and while he did not go on to have chart success like the some of the other stars, he did then become a top TV presenter. After winning Celebrity Big Brother, he hosted Big Brother's Bit on the Side, The Xtra Factor, This Morning, Strictly: It Takes Two as well as reboots of Supermarket Sweep and Ready Steady Cook. He also also covered the Eurovision Song Contest for the BBC and launched his own Saturday show on Radio 2. Follow us onFacebook,external, or on Twitter@BBCNewsEnts,external.

If global average temperatures were torise by 4C, more than half the country could see at least 10% more rain over the winter months. The UK climate projections suggest increases in winter rainfall in most parts of the country, as well as drier summers. Rainfall measurements fluctuate from year to year, making projections challenging. Not every winter will necessarily be rainier than the one before, and not every summer will be dry, but both trends could have big impacts. As the world warms, the UK is likely to have hotter, drier summers and warmer, wetter winters, according to the Met Office. Extreme weather events such as heatwaves and heavy downpours could become more frequent and more intense. Many scientists are concerned. ""I think it’s really frightening,” says Dr Lizzie Kendon, a senior Met Office scientist. “It's just a wake-up call really as to what we’re talking about here.” We are already seeing the impacts of climate change, but the level of global warming we reach and by when will depend primarily on the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. To some, warming weather may not seem like such a big deal. But even the smallest incremental changes in climate can have far-reaching effects. Temperatures above 30C for two or more days can trigger a public-health warning. In the 1990s, this happened about once every four years for locations in the South. By the 2070s, projections suggest it could be as frequently as four times per year - 16 times more often, if we do not curb our emissions. The Met Office projects rainy winters, which keep the soil wet into spring, and dry summers of infrequent rainfall will become the norm. Summer rain is likely to become less frequent but could be heavier. Without regular rainfall, the ground has a harder time absorbing water when it finally does come, leading to a greater risk of flash flooding. Floods will likely become a staple of warming winters as well. Steady rain, which is currently a feature of winter months, will probably continue, and total rainfall is expected to increase. When the ground is already saturated, waterways tend to rise. Bridges and sewers designed for historical rainfall levels may come increasingly under pressure. Warming temperatures could also mean cold spells become less frequent. Andsnowy UK winters could become thing of the pastas climate change affects the UK, according to Met Office analysis shared with BBC Panorama. Temperatures below freezing during the day and areas with considerable amounts of snow on the ground may be limited to parts of Scotland by the end of the century if emissions continue to rise. The BBC has collaborated with scientists from the Met Office to analyse data from their extensive weather measurement records and their major climate modelling project, theUK Climate Projections (UKCP). The present-day data shows averages of observed measurements for 1991-2019. The future data shows projected temperature and rainfall measurements produced by climate models for two different levels of global warming: if global average temperatures rise 2C above records from the mid-19th Century, the start of major industrialisation, and if that rise is 4C. Twelve different versions of the Met Office's Hadley Centre climate model were used in calculating the UKCP Regional (12km) projections using a high emissions gas scenario (RCP8.5). Climate models are computer simulations of how the atmosphere, oceans, land, plants and ice behave under various levels of atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations. They help scientists come up with projections for what conditions on Earth we are likely to see as global warming continues. The level of global warming depends on a number of factors. The most important is the amount of emissions produced in the coming years. Emissions are greenhouse gases released into our atmosphere. The accumulation of these gases has a warming effect on the globe, which in turn leads to changes in climatic conditions. Governments around the world have pledged to reduce their emissions to limit the degree of warming. During the Glasgow COP26 summit in 2021, countries agreed to meet the following year to pledge further major carbon cuts with the aim of keeping temperature rises within 1.5C above pre-industrial levels. If global temperatures rise by more than 1.5C, scientists say the Earth is likely to experience severe effectssuch as millions more people being exposed to extreme heat. If no interventions are taken, global average temperatures could rise by up to 4C by 2100. This high-emissions future is highlighted in themost recent Evidence Report for the UK's Climate Change Risk Assessment (CCRA)as possible, if less likely. Current pledges, if met, will only limit global warming to about 2.4C, while at current rates of global emissions, the world is on a pathway somewhere between 2C and 4C. The modelled projections in this data do not represent a specific time period. Instead, they show what conditions could be like in these two different levels of global warming. Some other climate data may project specific points in time by which a certain level of global warming may be reached. However, this model allows for the possibility of actions that may reduce or increase emissions enough to change the timing before we would experience a 2C or 4C future. More information on the methods used to calculate the timing of different levels of global warming can be found inthis 2018 Met Office paper. This tool presents six different measurements among those scientists use to gain a picture of the environment under various conditions. Each represents a specific predefined climate metric. 1. Hottest day is the maximum temperature recorded or projected on a single day 2. Summer days, as defined by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), have a maximum temperature above 25C 3. Average daytime temperature is the average of daily maximum air temperatures over a season 4. Rainy days are when more than 1mm of rain is recorded. This excludes days that may have had very light rain or a heavy morning dew or mist 5. Wettest day is the maximum amount of recorded or projected rainfall on a single day 6. Total rainfall is the amount in millimetres measured across a season. We also calculated and display the change in rainfall for the future scenarios as a percentage change from the current period (1991-2019) Climate data is typically presented in gridded squares that make up a large surface area. The grids used in this model are 12km by 12km. This level of detail is able to capture many of the varied climate conditions across the UK's diverse geography far better than other, broader-scale models. Each UK postcode has been matched to its nearest 12km-square grid. The results displayed for your area represent an average (mean) for the grids closest to that location, as long as they are no further than 34km away. In most cases a grid has been averaged with its eight nearest grids, except along irregular coastlines and small islands. Averaging means that the figures displayed are never for a single grid alone. While natural variability between grid areas is normal, this process minimises dramatic differences that may be down to chance. Both current and future data are organised into the same 12km-square grids. However, unlike future modelled predictions, the present-day data comes from actual observed measurements. We have presented a single number that represents an average for each grid and season. This helps to reduce the influence of outliers in observed data. For instance, the current number of summer days represents the mean number of days recording maximum temperatures of at least 25C per month in June, July and August across every year from 1991 to 2019. Each number presented in the two future scenarios represents the median of 12 possible outcomes as projected by the 12 model simulations. All future projection data has been calibrated by Met Office scientists against the data in the present-day range, 1991-2019, so the model results can be compared directly with observations. More information on the calibration technique used can be foundin this 2017 paper. Because climate data is gridded, the data may represent a larger area than that covered by a single weather station. Measurements from multiple weather stations are averaged together to give a single datapoint for a grid. Take the hottest day, for instance. If the highest temperature recorded at Cambridge Royal Botanic Gardens was 38.7C, that number is combined with measurements from other stations across the region to produce an average for a 12km-square area that includes Cambridge. Other weather stations will have recorded slightly lower temperatures, so the average highest temperature in this area would be less than 38.7C.

"The UK is already undergoing disruptive climate change with increased rainfall, sunshine and temperatures, according to scientists. The year 2020 was the third warmest, fifth wettest and eighth sunniest on record, scientists said in the latestUK State of the Climate report.,external No other year is in the top 10 on all three criteria. The experts said that, in the space of 30 years, the UK has become 0.9C warmer and 6% wetter. The report's lead author Mike Kendon, climate information scientist at the UK Met Office, told BBC News: âA lot of people think climate change is in the future â but this proves the climate is already changing here in the UK. âAs it continues to warm we are going to see more and more extreme weather such as heatwaves and floods.â Climate scientists begin debate on vital report Why is flash flooding hitting cities more often? Climate summit: Some progress made, says minister The report says the UK has become hotter, sunnier and rainier: 2020 was the third warmest UK year since 1884; all the years in the top 10 are since 2002 Last year was one of the least snowy on record; any snow mainly affected upland and northern areas Spring 2020 was the UKâs sunniest on record, and sunnier than most UK summers. 2020 was the UKâs fifth wettest year; six of the 10 wettest years have been since 1998 Scientists warn of worse extreme weather if global temperatures rise and politicians fail to curb carbon emissions. And in a separate report, scientists warned that greenhouse gas levels were already too high âfor a manageable future for humanityâ. Liz Bentley, head of the Royal Meteorological Society, said that even if governments could achieve the challenging outcome of limiting the global temperature rise to 1.5C â which looks very unlikely - that would still lead to a 10% increase in the amount of water the air can hold. âIn the UK,â she said, âwe are likely to see temperatures of 40C. As we get 1.5C warming, thatâll be something we see on a regular basis. ""People donât realise that even a small temperature rise of 0.1 or 0.2 degrees overall can make a huge difference â especially in the frequency and intensity of extreme events. âWe had roads melting last year, rails start to buckle, electric cabling starts to buckle. We often say weâd like a climate like the Med, but people were soon complaining they were too hot - not just in the day but especially at night. âIt often takes a massive high-impact event to change attitudes to the climate â so letâs hope whatâs been happening recently with extreme weather will raise the will to tackle the problem.â Leaves are appearing on trees earlier in response to the changing climate The State of the Climate report also indicates that plants are responding to the changes in climate. Leaves appeared on average 10.4 days earlier than the 1999-2019 baseline for a range of common shrub and tree species. While the signs of spring got earlier, so did the indications of autumn - trees in 2020 went bare on average 4.3 days earlier than the baseline. The report also said that, while substantial snow fell in 2018, 2013, 2010 and 2009, the number and severity of such weather events have declined since the 1960s. Sir James Bevan, the head of the Environment Agency, said there were more than five million homes at risk of flooding in England - and ""that risk is rising as the climate changes"". ""We can't remove the risk but we can reduce it,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. He said the EA's thinking needed to change faster than the climate, and its new strategy was not only about preventing floods, but also making communities more resilient to flooding when it does happen so that it does less damage. And Sir James said the government has made its biggest investment yet in flood defences,with Â£5.2bn of fundingto be spent on building 2,000 new flood defence schemes over the next six years. Meanwhile, a new paper from the Climate Crisis Advisory Group, founded by the former UK chief scientist Prof Sir David King, asks whether rapid heating in the Arctic region is driving changes in the jet stream in a way that influenced the recent weather extremes. The jet stream is a core of strong winds travelling west to east about five to seven miles above the Earth. The new paper said: ""We are simultaneously witnessing weather disaster in Germany, the highest temperatures for June in Finland and the US, the catastrophic heatwave in British Columbia, and extreme heat in Siberia. ""These are all outlier events that exceed what one would expect if it were 'only' a 1.2C warming impact (that's the amount the Earth has already warmed since pre-industrial times). ""Greenhouse gas levels are already too high for a manageable future for humanity."" The paper, which has not been peer-reviewed, urges governments to start removing greenhouse gases at scale from the atmosphere.

"The funding will allow an extra 88 million children to go to school Investing in education in the world's poorest countries is the ""single best investment we can make in the future of humanity"", Boris Johnson told a global education summit in London. World leaders pledged more than $4bn (Â£2.9bn) to support schools through the Global Partnership for Education. Nobel Prize winner Malala Yousafzai told the summit girls in particular faced an ""education crisis"". But charities warned the UK's aid cuts had harmed fundraising efforts. The Global Partnership for Education, which distributes funding in more than 90 poorer countries, wanted to raise $5bn (Â£3.6bn) to create an extra 88 million school places and support the learning of 175 million children during the next five years. Pledges at the summit, hosted by the UK and Kenya, included: Â£595m from the European Union Â£430m from the UK Â£300m from Norway Â£173m from Canada Â£218m over three years from the United States Julia Gillard, former Australian prime minister and chair of the education aid organisation, was confident that the full $5bn would be raised, but different national budget cycles would mean it would arrive in stages. School aid for Syrian children who know warplanes and not shops PM pledges Â£430m for girls' education at G7 Government wins vote to cut overseas aid She said the pandemic had disrupted education in all countries - but the impact of closing schools had been much worse in poorer countries where many families lacked access at home to internet connections or electricity. Malala Yousafzai told the summit improving education had to be a key part of pandemic recovery The UK prime minister hailed the fundraising initiative, saying investing in international education projects was a way of tackling ""ignorance and prejudice"" and boosting the economies of poorer countries. ""I'm immensely proud of the achievements of this summit today and I'm proud of what the UK has been able to contribute in spite of the difficult financial circumstances,"" Mr Johnson said. Improving access to good quality education, particularly for girls, was the ""panacea, the universal cure,"" the prime minister said. ""This is the Swiss Army knife, complete with Allen key, a screwdriver and everything else,"" he told the summit. But charity Save the Children said the fundraising drive had lost leverage because of the UK's own aid cuts, which had left it with ""diminishing leadership on the world stage"". The One anti-poverty campaign warned of a ""decidedly underwhelming result"", saying the UK's overseas aid cut had ""damaged our credibility"". Gabriela Bucher, executive director of Oxfam, questioned the priorities of a world in which billionaires could compete in launching private space rockets while millions of children are unable to go to school. She also warned of the negative impact from the UK ""dramatically cutting aid"". Malala Yousafzai told the summit of the importance of investing in education for girls in countries where they had fewer opportunities ""just because of their gender"". ""The world is facing a girls' education crisis,"" the education campaigner said, with more than 130 million out of school around the world and millions more at risk of not returning after the pandemic. ""Their futures are worth fighting for,"" she told the summit. Kenya's president, Uhuru Kenyatta, told the conference the fundraising event could ""avert an education catastrophe"". Angel Mbuthia says the pandemic has shown that problems do not stop at borders ""Education is the best equaliser,"" says Angel Mbuthia, a Kenyan campaigner for access to education, who is supporting the global education summit. The 26-year-old student leader, currently secretary for gender at the All Africa Students' Union, says education provides a ""ripple effect in giving solutions to our most pressing problems"". For instance improving health education is more cost effective than having to treat serious illnesses. ""Once you have a citizenry that is well-educated, they're able to take more preventative measures,"" she says. Preventing youth unemployment, creating more hi-tech industries, ""political awareness"" and promoting gender equality in Kenya will all depend on improving education, she says. ""It's a bedrock, the best foundation,"" she says, Angel supports campaigns for girls to have fair access to education, in rural areas as well as cities, and wants that to lead to fair representation in areas such as politics and the legal system. She argues that events such as the global summit need to give a voice to those who are excluded from a chance of education. In terms of whether donor countries should fund education elsewhere, she says individual countries cannot only look within their own borders - because international issues will still affect them, whether it's refugees, Covid or climate change. ""That's one realisation we've had from Covid-19,"" she says. An outbreak in China is now ""affecting someone in a very rural part of Kenya"". ""We have a responsibility to be global citizens, to talk about these issues,"" she says.

"The number of self-isolation alerts sent by the NHS Covid-19 app in England and Wales has risen to a new record of 689,313 in the week up to 21 July. The figures represent an increase of over 70,000 compared with the previous week. But the rate of increase was lower than the previous week, rising by 11% compared to 17%. If you are ""pinged"" by the app you are advised - but not legally obliged - to self-isolate for 10 days. However the government has said it is crucial for people to do so. In recent weeks, there has been widespread criticism that the app has been sending out so many alerts that hundreds of thousands of people are self-isolating and missing work, causing widespread disruption. It ledto the government allowing some key workers- such as those working in food distribution - to be exempt from having to self-isolate if pinged. Instead they have to take daily tests. There are currently 260 testing sites open for these workers, Downing Street said on Thursday - and they are working to set up another 800. After that, 1,200 more sites will be opened ""over the coming days"". From 16 August, all fully-vaccinated people will not need to self-isolate if pinged by the app, although they will be encouraged to book a Covid PCR test. The impact on businesses has resulted in calls for the 16 August deadline to be brought forward. The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders is asking for urgent assistanceto exempt staff pinged by the NHS Covidapp saying pings are affecting production. Many in the hospitality industry also complained of shortages as staff had to self-isolate. Some bar staff have told the BBC that they've lost a lot of money by missing shifts, while others say they have been told to delete the app by their manager. Bar staff told to delete Covid app over pingdemic Covid app settings changing to send fewer alerts What are the self-isolation rules if I'm fully vaccinated? The app alert is advisory only and not enforceable by law, unlike a phone call from the NHS Test and Trace team. Latest data from Test and Trace shows that 14% of cases transferred to contact-tracers in the week to 21 July were not reached and so were unable to provide details of close contacts. This is the highest proportion of people not reached since October last year. England's deputy chief medical officer Prof Jonathan Van Tam said separate figures from Public Health England showed the vaccines have now prevented 22 million Covid cases and 60,000 deaths. He added it was ""truly massive"". If you were looking for evidence that the ""pingdemic"" is over you will struggle to find it in these statistics. The figure of nearly 690,000 contact tracing alerts - or pings - is a new record, up 11% on the previous week. They were triggered by nearly 148,000 positive test results entered in the app, up 25%. Despite the anecdotal evidence of people switching off or getting rid of the app, there is no sign yet of mass deletions. But there are a few straws in the wind suggesting things might be changing. The rate of increase in pings slowed, and the number of alerts triggered by each positive test result was down. That suggests that people who later became infected had fewer close contacts - either because they were socialising less or because those they encountered did not have the app. In the week when restrictions in England were relaxed so that venues did not need to record visitors' details, check-ins via the app were sharply lower. As they find they don't need it to check in, more people may decide the app is more trouble than it's worth. But the team which designed it believes the NHS Covid-19 app is changing behaviour in useful ways - even if someone ignores a ping's instruction to self isolate they may become more cautious, and anyone who has a holiday planned may be nudged into staying at home for a few days beforehand rather than having their plans spoiled by an alert. At first, it was criticised for being ineffective, in recent weeks it's been accused of disrupting thousands of businesses, but its designers believe this experimental technology is finally proving that it can be a useful weapon in controlling the pandemic. After a week of falling cases the number of people testing positive for coronavirus rose on Wednesday, when 27,734 new daily cases were reported. Health Secretary Sajid Javid said: ""The truth is, when it comes to case numbers no one really knows where they are going to go next"". People in England and Wales can download the NHS Covid app (Northern Ireland and Scotland have their own). If you are using the app and spend enough time close to another person with it, you will receive a ""ping"" alert if they later test positive for Covid-19 and share the information with the app. The app uses the Bluetooth signal to determine whether your phone had recently been within 2m of theirs for at least 15 minutes. If you are ""pinged"" you're advised - but not legally obliged - to self-isolate for up to 10 days. Separately to the NHS Covid app, there have also been changes to the NHS app, which among other things is used for Covid vaccination records. It has been updated to allow iPhone and iPad users to store their Covid Pass using the Apple Wallet app. This can be used at events and venues in England,but not for international travel,externalthe government says.

"University students will get ""advance warning"" if they are required to have vaccines before moving to halls of residence, Dominic Raab has said. The foreign secretary said decisions will be taken in September - but he was keen to encourage vaccine uptake. More than 70% of adults have now had both jabs, and Mr Raab said ""we need to close that margin"". Currently, the government plans to require two jabs to go to nightclubs and other crowded venues in England. The full details of the plan are yet to be seen, but the rule is set to come into force at the end of September. An NHS Covid Pass - which you can obtain electronically or as a letter - will be used as proof. How can I prove I've had both my jabs? Covid: Have we passed the peak and can we relax? How many people have been vaccinated so far? Mr Raab was asked on BBC Radio 4's Today programme whether the government was in favour of going further and making the vaccine pass compulsory in more settings. ""I think the key principle is in crowded places where we want to open up... whether it's going to a football game or pop concert, we want to make sure people can do that,"" he said. And asked whether they were planning to require students in university halls to get vaccinated, Mr Raab said: ""When we come to the crunch, these decisions will be taken in September. We've got some time to go. ""Right the way through this pandemic we've had to take advice and decisions based on the evidence when we see it. ""We will certainly make sure university students have advance warning, of course we're going to be mindful of this."" He said he had recently visited France, where they had a big surge in vaccinations after bringing in a health pass for many activities. ""It's a little bit of coaxing and cajoling and also making clear that ultimately over September when we know we'll see, as a result of coming out of the lockdown step four, an increase in cases, we can control that with backstop safeguard measures."" Latest government figures show that more than 71% of adults have now had two jabs, while 88% have had a first dose. Young people who are within three months of turning 18 - meaning those who are soon able to go to university - and those aged 12-17 who live with people who have a suppressed immune system, can now also get a jab. The idea to make vaccines compulsory for university students - either to attend lectures or to live in halls of residence - was not ruled out by either education minister Vicky Ford or Downing Street when asked about it earlier this week. ""We are still looking at the scope for vaccination certifications,"" a No 10 spokesman said on Monday. It is not clear if any rule, if it happens, would apply just to England or be adopted by the whole of the UK - the governments of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland are in charge of their own coronavirus rules and education is devolved. Earlier this week, the trade union for academic staff such as lecturers, criticised the idea following news reports. ""Students should be prioritised for vaccinations, to ensure as many as possible have the opportunity to be vaccinated by September,"" said the University and College Union. ""But making vaccinations compulsory as a condition to access their education is wrong and would be hugely discriminatory against those who are unable to be vaccinated, and international students."" The National Union of Students also called the idea ""appalling"", saying there has been ""no consultation whatsoever with the sector"". ""All the students I speak with are incredibly eager to get their vaccinations - if anything they would like them bringing forwards so that they've had both doses before term begins,"" said president Larissa Kennedy. She accused the government of ""lining students up as scapegoats"", describing it as ""finger pointing nonsense"". Both Labour and leading universities have called for vaccination centres to be set up on campuses so that students are jabbed before the winter. The Russell Group - made up of the UK's top universities - has offered its own spaces and facilities to be used as pop-up centres. Are you affected by issues covered in this story?

"The number of people on furlough has fallen sharply, with young people moving off the government scheme fastest, new figures show. At the end of June, 1.9 million people were still on furlough, the lowest level since the start of the pandemic and half a million fewer than in May. In the last three months, younger people came off furlough twice as fast as all other age brackets. Almost 600,000 under-25s had left the scheme in that time, the Treasury said. At the same time, more than a million people in hospitality and retail have left the scheme. Chancellor Rishi Sunak hailed the latest figures, saying they showed the government's policies were working. At the peak of the pandemic in May last year, nearly nine million people were on furlough. The wage support scheme has been extended several times, but will end on 30 September. What impact has the furlough scheme had? How many people are on furlough and what has it cost? Lucy Walker-Evans spent nine months on furlough before being made redundant Lucy Walker-Evans from Chepstow was working as an account manager for a global hotel chain when she was put on furlough in March last year. The 45-year-old spent the next nine months on paid leave, a time she found harrowing at first. ""It felt like you were skiving off work, you kept waiting for the phone to ring, constantly felt guilty,"" she told the BBC. ""There was lots of crying, lots of worry, lots of uncertainty."" In January, she was made redundant, but the time off had given her a chance to take stock. She realised she wanted a less stressful job and to work in charity, and by February she had managed to find a role working at a local shelter for young homeless people - a job she loves. ""Had I not been furloughed, I would never have had time to think about my career, so it was a transformational experience really,"" she told the BBC. ""I also had a year to learn to live on a lower salary - you realise you don't always need to chase the next pay rise."" Jo Shippen says her staff were ""understanding"" about being furloughed Jo Shippen, managing director of Hatters Promotions, a promotional merchandise and print company in Stockport, said the furlough scheme had been a ""godsend"" for her business and staff. ""Without the furlough scheme, I would have to have let people go, I just would not have managed,"" she said. ""I know for a fact I would not have been able to run my business. I would not have been able to embrace the change and I would not have been able to adapt in the way we have adapted."" Hatters was able to continue operating during the lockdowns, but it ""pivoted"" away from events and conferences to supplying products for companies looking to improve staff engagement. Ms Shippen said she had been ""really lucky"" that her staff were ""understanding"" about being furloughed. Under the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme (CJRS), known as furlough, staff receive 80% of their current salary, capped at Â£2,500 a month. Furlough will be wound down further from Sunday as the government asks firms to make a bigger contribution. Since 1 July, employers have been asked to contribute 10% towards the wages of furloughed workers for hours their staff do not work. That amount will rise to to 20% in August and September. The scheme, drawn up after lengthy talks with business groups and union leaders, has cost taxpayers almost Â£50bn to date, arousing fearstaxes will have to rise to pay for it. Since the start of the scheme, a cumulative total of 11.6 million jobs have been supported by the CJRS at various times. It is credited with stopping a spike in unemployment and some fear jobs will be lost when it ends. But according to Tony Wilson, director of the Institute of Employment Studies, the number of people on furlough has been ""dropping like a stone"" as industries start to reopen, while fears of a ""rush of redundancies"" have been unfounded. ""Either employees are being brought back to work by their employers or they are being taken off furlough and leaving the labour market,"" Mr Wilson told the BBC. ""That could be young people going into full-time education rather than seeking work."" However, he noted some industries would be more exposed than others when the scheme finally ends, while support jobs such as office cleaning, security and delivery could also be lost if workers do not go back to the office in the same numbers because of the rise in home working. ""The answer is not extending furlough, but re-skilling people to take up the record number of new vacancies being advertised,"" Mr Wilson said. The top five industry groups with the highest rates of jobs being put on furlough at 31 May 2021: Air passenger transport (57%) Hotels and similar accommodation (57%) Travel agency and tour operator activities (51%) Photographic activities (43%) Beverage serving activities (43%) Source: ONS Tom Waters, senior research economist at the Institute for Fiscal Studies, said there was ""no way to know exactly"" how many jobs would have been lost, and for how long, had the furlough scheme not existed. ""But given that unemployment has only risen slightly since the start of the pandemic, despite the biggest fall in GDP ever recorded, I think it's fair to say that furlough has had a very significant impact on job retention,"" he added. The Trades Union Congress said it was ""great"" so many people had been able to return to work from furlough, but added some firms still required it. ""Doubling the employer contribution is too much too soon, putting jobs at risk in some parts of the economy,"" said Frances O'Grady, the union's general secretary. Laura Kearsley, head of employment law at Nelsons Solicitors, believes a lot of employers will review their workforce in the light of the furlough support being removed. She thinks that might result in an uptick in redundancies. ""I think we will see a lot of employers trying to agree measures that keep people in a job, such as reductions in pay or reductions in hours, changes in operating models,"" she said. She had this advice for those fearing redundancy: ""Find out about your rights. Dig out your employment contract, whatever you signed when you joined. ""Also ask for a company handbook or policy information about redundancy, that should set out what you can expect if you do find yourself in that situation."" Are you currently on furlough?

"Simon Cowell's show The X Factor ran from 2004-2018 but has not been seen since ITV have confirmed they have ""no plans"" for another series of The X Factor. The last full series of Simon Cowell's pop music TV talent show aired in 2018, although a celebrity edition was broadcast the following year. During its peak in the late noughties, the X Factor was one of the most popular TV shows in the UK. However, ratings have fallen in recent years. An ITV spokesman told the BBC: ""There are no current plans for the next series of The X Factor at this stage."" A report in The Sun,externalclaimed the show will be rested for at least five years. The X Factor first aired in 2004 and judges on the show have included Sharon Osbourne, Louis Walsh, Cheryl, and Nicole Scherzinger. A US version of the show ran for three seasons from 2011-2013. In 2019,ITV signed a deal with Cowellto broadcast Britain's Got Talent until at least 2024, but did not commit to keeping The X Factor past 2020. The singing competition regularly attracted an audience of more than 10 million a decade ago, withmore than 17 million viewers tuning into see Matt Cardle crowned the winner of the 2010 series. Louis Walsh, Sharon Osbourne and Simon Cowell during Ireland auditions for The X Factor in 2004 But ratings fell in subsequent years. In 2018, an average of 5.3 million people watched Dalton Harris crowned the winner, when the judges were Louis Tomlinson, Robbie Williams and Ayda Field. The show was absent in 2019, with a celebrity edition taking its place and in early 2020 it was revealed that Cowell was to give it another year off. Last month, it was revealed the music mogul's attentions have now turned to leading a fresh panel of judges in an upcoming new ITV musical game show, entitled Walk The Line. One Direction in 2011 on the X Factor Live Tour at London's Wembley Arena While many people down the years walked away from the early rounds of The X Factor broken-hearted, a coterie of successful contestants have enjoyed brilliant showbiz careers off the back of the show. One Directionfinished third in series seven of the show in 2010, and subsequently signed to Cowell's label Syco. After dominating the charts with four number one singles and albums, all five former members of the boyband - Niall Horan, Liam Payne, Harry Styles, Louis Tomlinson and Zayn Malik (who left the band in 2015) have gone on to enjoy solo careers. Leona Lewisis the second best-selling act to come out of the show after 1D. The Bleeding Love singer has sold more than 30 million records worldwide and been nominated for several Brit and Grammy awards. She made her Broadway debut in 2016, as Grizabella, in Andrew Lloyd Webber's musical Cats. Little Mixrose to fame in 2011 as the first girl group to win the UK version of the show. They have gone on to score a plethora of hit singles including five number ones. They won a raft of Brit Awards, including best group at this year's ceremony.They split from Syco recordsin 2018, days before the release of their album LM5, with Cowell saying it was down to him having fallen out with their management company. Jesy Nelson left the band in December. Little Mix followed One Direction on to the Syco Records roster Olly Mursfinished second in the sixth series of The X Factor in 2009. He went on to have four UK number one singles and albums (the same as 1D, incidentally), before moving into the world of TV presenting. Murs hosted the spin-off show The Xtra Factor, alongside the late Caroline Flack. The pair also presented the main series in 2015. Since 2018, he has been a coach on The Voice UK. Rylan Clark-Nealfinished fifth place in the nine series of X Factor, and while he did not go on to have chart success like the some of the other stars, he did then become a top TV presenter. After winning Celebrity Big Brother, he hosted Big Brother's Bit on the Side, The Xtra Factor, This Morning, Strictly: It Takes Two as well as reboots of Supermarket Sweep and Ready Steady Cook.

"The funding will allow an extra 88 million children to go to school Investing in education in the world's poorest countries is the ""single best investment we can make in the future of humanity"", Boris Johnson told a global education summit in London. World leaders pledged more than $4bn (Â£2.9bn) to support schools through the Global Partnership for Education. Nobel Prize winner Malala Yousafzai told the summit girls in particular faced an ""education crisis"". But charities warned the UK's aid cuts had harmed fundraising efforts. The Global Partnership for Education, which distributes funding in more than 90 poorer countries, wanted to raise $5bn (Â£3.6bn) to create an extra 88 million school places and support the learning of 175 million children during the next five years. Pledges at the summit, hosted by the UK and Kenya, included: Â£595m from the European Union Â£430m from the UK Â£300m from Norway Â£173m from Canada Â£218m over three years from the United States Julia Gillard, former Australian prime minister and chair of the education aid organisation, was confident that the full $5bn would be raised, but different national budget cycles would mean it would arrive in stages. School aid for Syrian children who know warplanes and not shops PM pledges Â£430m for girls' education at G7 Government wins vote to cut overseas aid She said the pandemic had disrupted education in all countries - but the impact of closing schools had been much worse in poorer countries where many families lacked access at home to internet connections or electricity. Malala Yousafzai told the summit improving education had to be a key part of pandemic recovery The UK prime minister hailed the fundraising initiative, saying investing in international education projects was a way of tackling ""ignorance and prejudice"" and boosting the economies of poorer countries. ""I'm immensely proud of the achievements of this summit today and I'm proud of what the UK has been able to contribute in spite of the difficult financial circumstances,"" Mr Johnson said. Improving access to good quality education, particularly for girls, was the ""panacea, the universal cure,"" the prime minister said. ""This is the Swiss Army knife, complete with Allen key, a screwdriver and everything else,"" he told the summit. But charity Save the Children said the fundraising drive had lost leverage because of the UK's own aid cuts, which had left it with ""diminishing leadership on the world stage"". The One anti-poverty campaign warned of a ""decidedly underwhelming result"", saying the UK's overseas aid cut had ""damaged our credibility"". Gabriela Bucher, executive director of Oxfam, questioned the priorities of a world in which billionaires could compete in launching private space rockets while millions of children are unable to go to school. She also warned of the negative impact from the UK ""dramatically cutting aid"". Malala Yousafzai told the summit of the importance of investing in education for girls in countries where they had fewer opportunities ""just because of their gender"". ""The world is facing a girls' education crisis,"" the education campaigner said, with more than 130 million out of school around the world and millions more at risk of not returning after the pandemic. ""Their futures are worth fighting for,"" she told the summit. Kenya's president, Uhuru Kenyatta, told the conference the fundraising event could ""avert an education catastrophe"". Angel Mbuthia says the pandemic has shown that problems do not stop at borders ""Education is the best equaliser,"" says Angel Mbuthia, a Kenyan campaigner for access to education, who is supporting the global education summit. The 26-year-old student leader, currently secretary for gender at the All Africa Students' Union, says education provides a ""ripple effect in giving solutions to our most pressing problems"". For instance improving health education is more cost effective than having to treat serious illnesses. ""Once you have a citizenry that is well-educated, they're able to take more preventative measures,"" she says. Preventing youth unemployment, creating more hi-tech industries, ""political awareness"" and promoting gender equality in Kenya will all depend on improving education, she says. ""It's a bedrock, the best foundation,"" she says, Angel supports campaigns for girls to have fair access to education, in rural areas as well as cities, and wants that to lead to fair representation in areas such as politics and the legal system. She argues that events such as the global summit need to give a voice to those who are excluded from a chance of education. In terms of whether donor countries should fund education elsewhere, she says individual countries cannot only look within their own borders - because international issues will still affect them, whether it's refugees, Covid or climate change. ""That's one realisation we've had from Covid-19,"" she says. An outbreak in China is now ""affecting someone in a very rural part of Kenya"". ""We have a responsibility to be global citizens, to talk about these issues,"" she says.

"A drug company that increased the price of a crucial thyroid remedy more than 10-fold has prompted fines of more than Â£100m by the competition watchdog. Advanz pushed up the price of thyroid tablet packs from Â£20 in 2009 to Â£248 in 2017, making the drug unaffordable for the NHS. It ""exploited a loophole enabling it to reap much higher profits"", the Competition and Markets Authority said. The fine applies to Advanz and two private equity firms. The CMA said its latest fine sent ""a clear message"" to the pharmaceutical sector that breaking the law would not be tolerated. It said an investigation had shown that from 2009 until 2017, Advanz charged excessive and unfair prices for supplying liothyronine tablets, which are used to treat thyroid hormone deficiency. ""They achieved this because liothyronine tablets were among a number of drugs that, although genericised, faced limited or no competition and therefore could sustain repeated price increases,""the CMA said in a statement.,external But a spokesman for Advanz said: ""We utterly disagree with the CMA's decision on the pricing of liothyronine tablets and will be appealing. ""At all times, Advanz Pharma acted in the interest of patients, investing significantly to keep this medicine on the market to the specifications required by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA)."" Advanz Pharma specialises in complicated, difficult-to-manufacture drugs that are no longer protected by patents. Anyone can make them, but because they are more complex than normal medicines, most generic drug makers choose not to. This specialisation, the Advanz website boasts, ""provides essential cost-savings to the NHS and wider European healthcare"". The Competition and Markets Authority's investigation found another motivation, at least when it came to the supply of one type of thyroid tablets, which contain the chemical liothyronine, to the NHS. From 2007, the company adopted a deliberate ""price optimisation"" strategy, which meant exploiting these niche products to drive up prices. The increases were staggering - 6,000% over a nine-year period - and led eventually to the NHS dropping the drug from its purchase lists altogether. This left patients who suffered from thyroid deficiency and relied on liothyronine tablets - rather than the more common levothyroxine tablets - with the choice of giving up their treatment or having to buy their own tablets at great expense. Advanz itself was directly fined Â£40.9m. Private equity firms HgCapital and Cinven, which were previously owners of the businesses now forming part of Advanz, were fined Â£8.6m and Â£51.9m respectively. Michael Grenfell, executive director for enforcement at the CMA, told the BBC that the decision to push up the price of the drug had had ""a real human cost"". ""The NHS simply wasn't able to afford it on the scale that was needed,"" he said. He added that a number of drug companies were ""engaged in anti-competitive practices that have racked up expenses for the NHS"". Prior to Advanz lifting prices, the NHS spent Â£600,000 on the tablets in 2006. Just three years later, that had risen to more than Â£2.3m and by 2016, the CMA said the NHS was paying Â£30m for the drug. The CMA said that Advanz's decision to increase the price of the treatment was ""not driven by any meaningful innovation or investment, volumes remained broadly stable, and the cost of producing the tablets did not increase significantly"". As well as imposing a substantial fine, the CMA said its decision will also make it ""easier for the NHS to seek compensation for the firms' behaviour, by way of damages, should it choose to do so"". The thyroid gland makes hormones - called T4 and T3 - that affect things like heart rate and body temperature. Some people have an underactive thyroid and need to take drugs to boost their hormone levels. Most patients with hypothyroidism - the medical name for symptoms caused by an underactive thyroid - take a drug called levothyroxine or T4. But some say they feel better if they take a different, more expensive thyroid drug called liothyronine or T3. T4 is the inactive version of T3 - the body needs to convert it into T3, which might explain why some people say they benefit from liothyronine. But prescribing it remains somewhat controversial because of the high cost and limited research to prove its worth. Guidelines recommend T4 as standard, but do not rule out people being prescribed T3. With more manufacturers now making and supplying T3, the cost is going down. This is the second time this month that the CMA has taken action against excessive price rises imposed by pharmaceutical firms. Two weeks ago, it imposed fines of more than Â£260m after finding that Auden Mckenzie and Actavis UK (now known as Accord-UK) ""charged the NHS excessively high prices"" for hydrocortisone tablets for almost a decade. At the time, CMA chief executive Andrea Coscelli said the NHS was at one point being charged more than Â£80 for a single pack of tablets that had previously cost less than Â£1. He added that the fine served as ""a warning to any other drug firm planning to exploit the NHS"".

"University students will get ""advance warning"" if they are required to have vaccines before moving to halls of residence, Dominic Raab has said. The foreign secretary said decisions will be taken in September - but he was keen to encourage vaccine uptake. More than 70% of adults have now had both jabs, and Mr Raab said ""we need to close that margin"". Currently, the government plans to require two jabs to go to nightclubs and other crowded venues in England. The full details of the plan are yet to be seen, but the rule is set to come into force at the end of September. An NHS Covid Pass - which you can obtain electronically or as a letter - will be used as proof. How can I prove I've had both my jabs? Covid: Have we passed the peak and can we relax? How many people have been vaccinated so far? Mr Raab was asked on BBC Radio 4's Today programme whether the government was in favour of going further and making the vaccine pass compulsory in more settings. ""I think the key principle is in crowded places where we want to open up... whether it's going to a football game or pop concert, we want to make sure people can do that,"" he said. And asked whether they were planning to require students in university halls to get vaccinated, Mr Raab said: ""When we come to the crunch, these decisions will be taken in September. We've got some time to go. ""Right the way through this pandemic we've had to take advice and decisions based on the evidence when we see it. ""We will certainly make sure university students have advance warning, of course we're going to be mindful of this."" He said he had recently visited France, where they had a big surge in vaccinations after bringing in a health pass for many activities. ""It's a little bit of coaxing and cajoling and also making clear that ultimately over September when we know we'll see, as a result of coming out of the lockdown step four, an increase in cases, we can control that with backstop safeguard measures."" Latest government figures show that more than 71% of adults have now had two jabs, while 88% have had a first dose. Young people who are within three months of turning 18 - meaning those who are soon able to go to university - and those aged 12-17 who live with people who have a suppressed immune system, can now also get a jab. The idea to make vaccines compulsory for university students - either to attend lectures or to live in halls of residence - was not ruled out by either education minister Vicky Ford or Downing Street when asked about it earlier this week. ""We are still looking at the scope for vaccination certifications,"" a No 10 spokesman said on Monday. It is not clear if any rule, if it happens, would apply just to England or be adopted by the whole of the UK - the governments of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland are in charge of their own coronavirus rules and education is devolved. Earlier this week, the trade union for academic staff such as lecturers, criticised the idea following news reports. ""Students should be prioritised for vaccinations, to ensure as many as possible have the opportunity to be vaccinated by September,"" said the University and College Union. ""But making vaccinations compulsory as a condition to access their education is wrong and would be hugely discriminatory against those who are unable to be vaccinated, and international students."" The National Union of Students also called the idea ""appalling"", saying there has been ""no consultation whatsoever with the sector"". ""All the students I speak with are incredibly eager to get their vaccinations - if anything they would like them bringing forwards so that they've had both doses before term begins,"" said president Larissa Kennedy. She accused the government of ""lining students up as scapegoats"", describing it as ""finger pointing nonsense"". Both Labour and leading universities have called for vaccination centres to be set up on campuses so that students are jabbed before the winter. The Russell Group - made up of the UK's top universities - has offered its own spaces and facilities to be used as pop-up centres. Are you affected by issues covered in this story?

Thank you for
joining us. It was brought to you by Owen Amos, Lauren Turner, Francesca Gillett, Mary O'Connor, Ashitha Nagesh, Jen Meierhans, Steffan Powell, Sophie Williams, Emma Harrison and Jo Couzens. Weâll be ending our live coverage for today shortly but,
before we go, hereâs a reminder of todayâs main coronavirus headlines from the
UK and around the world: Nearly a third of young adults in England have still not had a first dose of a Covid-19 vaccine, figures show. Some 68.1% of people aged 18 to 29 had received a first dose by 25 July, according to estimates from NHS England, meaning 31.9% are likely to be unvaccinated - the equivalent of around 2.7 million adults under 30. The figures are a small improvement on the previous week, when 33.6% of 18 to 29-year-olds had yet to have a first dose. A breakdown of the age group by gender shows vaccine take-up remains lower among men than women - an estimated 73% of women aged 25 to 29 have had a first dose, compared with 66.3% of men. Among 18 to 24-year-olds, 70% of women are estimated to have received one dose, and 62.2% of men. All adults in England have been able to book a first dose since 18 June. Pakistan has set a deadline for all service sector employees to get vaccinated Governments in south Asia have announced new precautions as
coronavirus infections continue to surge through their populations. Pakistan has set a deadline of the end of August for all
service sector employees to get vaccinated - along with teachers and pupils over the age of 18. Officials in the country have also announced people who haven't been vaccinated won't be allowed into malls, schools, restaurants or government offices from 1 August, and will be banned from air travel. In India, a monitoring team from Delhi was despatched to the
state of Kerala, which now accounts for nearly 40% of active cases in India. Kerala was praised internationally for its success in tackling the first wave
of Covid early last year. As Bangladesh experiences its deadliest month of the
pandemic, it has also been hit by a surge in dengue fever. Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst An outbreak of Covid-19 at an international airport last week has now led to the identification of cases in at least 13 other cities across China,
including the capital Beijing. Last week, a number of airport workers tested positive at the
Nanjing Lukou International Airport, prompting flight cancellations
and delays. State media reported yesterday that 1,657 members of airport staff
were told to self-isolate and monitor their health for two weeks. Cases, however, quickly spread in Nanjing, and local officials
confirmed that the Delta variant was present in the city. There are now 171
confirmed symptomatic cases, and the local government has placed many
communities in Nanjing under lockdown. A massive testing drive covering the
cityâs 9.3m population is taking place. Cases have been identified in at least 13 cities Media are somewhat optimistic that China can handle this outbreak. Nanjingâs local health commission has said the majority of patients in the city are only exhibiting mild symptoms, thanks to huge uptake of vaccination. The national Global Times newspaper says that in the city, only three are seriously unwell. The paper adds, however, that cases linked to the Nanjing outbreak have now been identified in âat least 13 citiesâ including Chengdu and Beijing. Cases had already reached nine cities spanning five Chinese provinces yesterday. The state-run The Paper news website suggests that more cases may soon be appearing elsewhere. It says today that based on information circulated by health commissions, âthe trajectory of the Nanjing cases involves 26 cities in 15 provincesâ. Millions have received promised Russian Sputnik V vaccines, but deliveries are falling short of orders Countries across the globe say theyâve been let down by
broken promises and stalled deliveries of Russiaâs Sputnik Covid vaccine. Scores of countries signed deals to buy millions of doses of
Sputnik V, unveiled last year as the worldâs first Covid jab. But many countries, including developing nations, have reported
receiving only a fraction of the doses for which theyâve paid. Russia has championed Sputnik V as part of its âvaccine diplomacyâ
with developing nations. Criticism of the vaccine in the West is dismissed as âheinous
propagandaâ. Read
more about the global anger here. There has been a spike in demand for flights from America to UK since the government announced US and EU double-jabbed travellers arriving from amber list countries would not have to quarantine. Virgin Atlantic said it had had more than three times as many bookings for flights from New York to London compared with a week earlier, while total bookings across all its US to UK routes more than doubled. From 04:00 BST on Monday 2 August,EU and US passengers arriving in England, Wales and Scotland from amber list countries- with the exception of France - will not have to complete the 10-day quarantine period. Virgin Atlantic's chief commercial officer Juha Jarvinen said: ""Flight bookings are up by more than 100% week-on-week, with bookings from New York to London increasing by nearly 250%, compared to the previous week."" Mr Jarvinen added that the forthcoming rule change had ""increased consumer confidence"" but urged the government to ""go further"" by placing the US on its travel green list. This wouldallow unvaccinated passengers to avoid quarantine- provided they have proof of a negative pre-departure Covid test and take a second test on their return. Deputy chief medical officer Prof Jonathan Van-Tam told us earlier that around 60,000 deaths have been prevented in England as a result of the Covid vaccine programme. He also said an estimated 22 million cases have also been stopped - a ""truly massive"" success. His comments came in a special programme with Radio 1 Newsbeat listeners, including some who are worried about getting a jab. Prof Van-Tam said the more people get a jab, the less likely more lockdowns are. The chances of another lockdown will be ""much lower"" if a higher proportion of the population, including 18-25-year-olds, get their jabs, he said. He also said he can't know yet if there will be a fourth wave of Covid infections in the UK, but it's possible we'll have some ""bumpy"" periods in autumn and winter - not just with Covid, but also flu and other respiratory viruses. Read the full story here. PA Media Alix Dietzel, right, and her sister Rosa We've been hearing some of your reactions to the relaxation of quarantine rules in England. One mother says it will end a ""sad"" and ""scary"" time for people like her with family overseas. Dr Alix Dietzel, a lecturer from Bristol, has close family in Austria - where she was brought up - as well as in Switzerland, France and the United States. Seeing them has been largely impossible during the pandemic. New rules being introduced on Monday mean those who are fully vaccinated against Covid will not have to quarantine when arriving in England from the US, the EU and a number of other countries including Switzerland, making travel much easier. Dr Dietzel, 33, told PA News agency: ""I'm relieved - it's been a long time and I wasn't sure when we'd be able to see each other again. ""Although we're used to being apart, we see each other a few times a year normally. ""So not being able to travel is quite sad and sometimes scary, especially in an unpredictable pandemic."" Dr Dietzel says her sister Rosa has only met her 20-month-old daughter once.""It makes me sad, my family has missed so much of her life."" More reaction:No quarantine for fully jabbed US and EU travellers Reality Check With the Tokyo Olympics under way, new cases of Covid continue to be identified at the Games. Infections in Japan have been climbing for some weeks, and are approaching the levels seen during an earlier coronavirus surge in May. The BBC's Reality Check team has taken a look into cases in the Olympic bubble and across the country. Read more about that here. Israel is to become the first country in the world to offer
a third dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech coronavirus vaccine to people over 60, as
cases of the highly contagious Delta variant continue to rise. From Sunday, those who are eligible will be able to get a
booster shot - so long as they were given their second dose at least five months
ago, according to local media. The World Health Organization and the US Centers for
Disease Control said recently that people who had been fully vaccinated did not need a booster shot at this time. However, the Israeli health ministry has reported a decrease
in the Pfizer vaccineâs effectiveness against infection and a slight decrease
in preventing severe illness. Pfizer has yet to apply for emergency authorisation for a
third dose from the US Food and Drug Administration, though the company has
said it could do so as early as August. Almost 62% of Israelâs population of nine million has been
fully vaccinated. Earlier this week, Israelâs health ministry authorised the
limited use of the Pfizer vaccine for children between five and 11 years old who have a high likelihood of serious illness or death from Covid-19. Thelatest figures,externalshow that deaths have increased by 28.9% per
100,000 people from the previous week (16 to 22 July), with 499 recorded in the last seven days, a rise of 112. Cases have fallen 37.1% per 100,000 people from the previous
week, with 204,669 recorded between 23 and 29 July, a fall of 120,554. Another 43,873 people in the UK have had a first dose of
a coronavirus vaccine, the government figures show. In total, 88.4% of the
adult population has now had at least one jab. And a further 171,341 have had a second vaccine dose now. As of today, 71.4% of the
adult population has now had both jabs. There
have been a further 31,117 cases of coronavirus reported in the UK
today, according to thelatest government
figures,external. And
there have been another 85 deaths, of people who had tested
positive for the virus within the previous 28 days. The prime minister appreciates the impact of the so-called pingdemic and says the expansion of daily testing for critical workers will help more industries to keep moving, No 10 says. The prime minister's official spokesman, speaking a little earlier, says the app continues to do what
it's designed to do. That is breaking chains of transmission, stopping people infected with
virus going out and passing it on - and the government continues to ask people to isolate if told
to do so. He says 260 testing sites are open to support workers in critical industries to avoid having to self-isolate if they come into contact with a positive coronavirus case by being tested each day before work. The provision is being put in place to support critical sectors before a widespread quarantine exemption for fully vaccinated people is brought in on 16 August. The PM's official spokesman says: ""We now have over 260 of these sites providing testing and we are in the process of establishing 800 further.""Following them, we will then establish the remaining 1,200 over the coming days. ""As we said when we set this out, our intention is to get these up and running as quickly as possible so we can ensure industries that provide the critical service they provide can continue to do so."" Robert CuffeBBC head of statistics The number of pings has been going up - but not as quickly as the number of cases. If we look at the number of times people have been checking into venues, that has fallen pretty significantly from about 14m at the start of June to just over 6.5m in the week ending 21 July. When all legal restrictions were lifted on 19 July, you no longer had to check in so some of that last fall may be because restaurants and pubs aren't making you do it any more, but you do see a pretty clear pattern there. It could be that people are maybe being just a little bit more careful, they're going into restaurants a little bit less. Or they're getting pinged less because when they're sitting beside somebody they very carefully move their phone 2m away - or switch it off. We don't have clear data on that but when you combine the fall in the number of check-ins and the fact that we are seeing fewer pings per person who tests positive, it's starting to paint a picture of less use of the app - or certainly less bringing your phone with you. As we've reported today, while fully vaccinated visitors from the EU and US will be allowed to enter England without quarantining, this won't apply to France - a rule that will only be reviewed at the end of next week. Now, France's Europe Minister Clement Beaune has branded the move ""discriminatory"". ""It's excessive, and it's frankly incomprehensible on health grounds,"" he said on LCI TV. ""It's not based on science, and it's discriminatory towards the French... I hope it will be reviewed as soon as possible, it's just common sense."" He added that France wasn't planning any tit-for-tat measures, ""for now"". The UK says it's keeping quarantine rules for travellers from France because of the presence of the Beta variant there, but French officials say most of the Beta cases are in French overseas territories. Sydney is about to enter its sixth week of lockdown Meanwhile, in Australia, the state of New South Wales has recorded 239 new cases - the highest daily rise since the start of the pandemic. Sydney is about to enter its sixth week of lockdown following a rise in cases there. People living in eight hot spots in the city have been ordered to wear masks outdoors and must stay within 5km of their homes. New South Wales Police says it has asked for 300 military members to help enforce lockdown restrictions. State Premier Gladys Berejiklian has warned that things are likely to get worse before they get better. As we've been reporting, a record number of people in England and Wales have beenadvised to self-isolate by the NHS Covid app in the week to 21 July. But how does the NHS Covid app work? If you spend enough time close to another person using it, you will receive a ""ping"" alert if they test positive for Covid. You need to be 2m (6ft) from them for 15 minutes to trigger a message. If you are ""pinged"" you're advised - but not legally obliged -to self-isolate until 10 days have passed since your contact with them. The UK government has said it is ""crucial"" to self-isolate when sent an alert. Northern IrelandandScotlandhave separate apps. What's been the impact of the record pings? Supermarkets, pub chains, transport networks, council bin collection services and firms say they have struggled with staff shortages due to the high number of employees self-isolating. In England, employers providing critical services can now request an exemption for named employees who are fully vaccinated.Sectors include energy and emergency services,external. Supermarket depot workers and food manufacturers are exempt from quarantine rules whatever their vaccination status. A similar system is being launched in Scotland. You can read our full explainerhere. Robert CuffeBBC head of statistics This figure is a bit of an
exaggeration, since it asks what would happen in a world with no vaccination
and no new lockdowns. But it shouldnât be
surprising for such a model to suggest that vaccines could have saved many tens
of thousands of lives in England alone. The modellers behind the
figure looked at the number of infections weâve seen since the start of the
year. They then asked how many of
those infected people would have died if the death rates from 2020 still
applied. That alone could account for
thousands of deaths: weâre seeing case rates last seen in December and January
when tens of thousands of people died. Since the vaccine also slows
the spread of the virus a bit, the modellers then add something on for the
infections that the vaccine has prevented, and the deaths they would have caused. Had we seen deaths returning
to those winter levels, there almost certainly would have been a return to
lockdowns. So a model that assumes there
wouldnât overstates the death toll that the vaccination program has spared us. A short while ago, Prof Jonathan Van-Tam told the BBC the vaccine rollout has prevented 22m cases of Covid and 60,000 deaths, according to Public Health England (PHE). Those figures are for England and cover the period up to 23 July, based onresearch carried out by PHE and Cambridge University,external. Vaccines are also estimated to have directly averted more than 52,600 hospital admissions. Previous estimates, for the period up to 9 July, had suggested about 37,000 deaths and 11,000,000 infections had been prevented. Â© 2025 BBC.

In England, employers providing critical services can now request an exemption for named employees who are fully vaccinated.Sectors include energy and emergency services,external. Supermarket depot workers and food manufacturers are exempt from quarantine rules whatever their vaccination status. A similar system is being launched in Scotland. You can read our full explainerhere. Robert CuffeBBC head of statistics This figure is a bit of an
exaggeration, since it asks what would happen in a world with no vaccination
and no new lockdowns. But it shouldnât be
surprising for such a model to suggest that vaccines could have saved many tens
of thousands of lives in England alone. The modellers behind the
figure looked at the number of infections weâve seen since the start of the
year. They then asked how many of
those infected people would have died if the death rates from 2020 still
applied. That alone could account for
thousands of deaths: weâre seeing case rates last seen in December and January
when tens of thousands of people died. Since the vaccine also slows
the spread of the virus a bit, the modellers then add something on for the
infections that the vaccine has prevented, and the deaths they would have caused. Had we seen deaths returning
to those winter levels, there almost certainly would have been a return to
lockdowns. So a model that assumes there
wouldnât overstates the death toll that the vaccination program has spared us. A short while ago, Prof Jonathan Van-Tam told the BBC the vaccine rollout has prevented 22m cases of Covid and 60,000 deaths, according to Public Health England (PHE). Those figures are for England and cover the period up to 23 July, based onresearch carried out by PHE and Cambridge University,external. Vaccines are also estimated to have directly averted more than 52,600 hospital admissions. Previous estimates, for the period up to 9 July, had suggested about 37,000 deaths and 11,000,000 infections had been prevented. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Teachers have faced lobbying from some parents over this year's grades, suggests research by a leading social mobility charity Parents of pupils in private schools or living in affluent areas of England were the most likely to put pressure on teachers over exam grades, suggests research fromthe Sutton Trust.,external Almost a quarter of private school teachers had been contacted by parents over A-level and GCSE grades, twice as many as in schools in deprived areas. Teachers submitted grades this year after exams were disrupted by Covid. Head teachers warned such lobbying was ""inappropriate"" and added stress. The research, based on a survey of 3,200 teachers, showed teachers in private schools came under the greatest pressure, with the highest number, 23%, reporting parents contacting them over exam grades. But there was also a social gap between state schools, with 17% of teachers in better-off areas facing pressure from parents, compared with 11% in disadvantaged areas. Teachers' grades used for cancelled exams Students offered cash to defer university places Parents urged to trust teachers over grades Geoff Barton, leader of the ASCL head teachers' union, said parents lobbying for their children ""think they are doing the best for their children, but it is yet another issue which has added to the stress of an extremely stressful period"". But he reassured students that grades were based on objective evidence - ""rather than whose parents have the sharpest elbows"". Mr Barton had previously warned the education select committee that some parents were threatening to involve lawyers over grades and that schools were expecting a ""huge number of appeals"". A-level and GCSE results will be published in a couple of weeks Schools submitted their judgements on grades last month - and the final results will appear in a couple of weeks, with forecasts of an increase in top grades, which could put pressure on university places. Researchers found that half of students applying to university were worried that the disruption caused by the pandemic and the replacement grading system would negatively affect their chance of getting into their first choice university. But Paul Whiteman, leader of the National Association of Head Teachers, said parents and students should be confident of the fairness and ""rigour of this year's awarding processes and understand that it is inappropriate to put pressure on staff"". Schools have been able to use a range of evidence for grades, including ""mini-exam"" test papers, mock exams, homework and coursework - after the usual set of full exam papers were cancelled. The study from the Sutton Trust charity, which champions social mobility, shows how much variation there has been. Typically three or four ""mini-exams"" taken, but there were some schools taking more than six, while others were taking one, two or none at all. There were also warnings of the difficulties facing some pupils when they were studying from home - such as a lack of space to work and problems with internet connections and equipment. The report calls on universities to give extra consideration to students from disadvantaged backgrounds who narrowly missed their required grades. And there is a warning that this year's new students will need more support to settle in, after so many difficulties from the pandemic and when students might not have been able to visit universities on open days. ""This year's cohort of university applicants have faced almost two years of disrupted education. As we approach results day, it's vital that poorer students are not disadvantaged by the greater impact of the pandemic on them,"" said Sutton Trust founder Sir Peter Lampl. He also backed suggestions to change the timetable for university applications, so that students could apply once they knew their grades. A Department for Education spokeswoman said: ""Students have only been assessed on what they had been taught, supporting students who may not have had the opportunity to learn as much as they would do in a normal year and meaning that teachers have effectively made their assessments based on every student having their best day. ""No teacher should be put under undue pressure and grades are subject to wider internal checks in schools and external checks by exam boards to make sure they are a fair reflection of students' work.""

"The number of people on furlough has fallen sharply, with young people moving off the government scheme fastest, new figures show. At the end of June, 1.9 million people were still on furlough, the lowest level since the start of the pandemic and half a million fewer than in May. In the last three months, younger people came off furlough twice as fast as all other age brackets. Almost 600,000 under-25s had left the scheme in that time, the Treasury said. At the same time, more than a million people in hospitality and retail have left the scheme. Chancellor Rishi Sunak hailed the latest figures, saying they showed the government's policies were working. At the peak of the pandemic in May last year, nearly nine million people were on furlough. The wage support scheme has been extended several times, but will end on 30 September. What impact has the furlough scheme had? How many people are on furlough and what has it cost? Lucy Walker-Evans spent nine months on furlough before being made redundant Lucy Walker-Evans from Chepstow was working as an account manager for a global hotel chain when she was put on furlough in March last year. The 45-year-old spent the next nine months on paid leave, a time she found harrowing at first. ""It felt like you were skiving off work, you kept waiting for the phone to ring, constantly felt guilty,"" she told the BBC. ""There was lots of crying, lots of worry, lots of uncertainty."" In January, she was made redundant, but the time off had given her a chance to take stock. She realised she wanted a less stressful job and to work in charity, and by February she had managed to find a role working at a local shelter for young homeless people - a job she loves. ""Had I not been furloughed, I would never have had time to think about my career, so it was a transformational experience really,"" she told the BBC. ""I also had a year to learn to live on a lower salary - you realise you don't always need to chase the next pay rise."" Jo Shippen says her staff were ""understanding"" about being furloughed Jo Shippen, managing director of Hatters Promotions, a promotional merchandise and print company in Stockport, said the furlough scheme had been a ""godsend"" for her business and staff. ""Without the furlough scheme, I would have to have let people go, I just would not have managed,"" she said. ""I know for a fact I would not have been able to run my business. I would not have been able to embrace the change and I would not have been able to adapt in the way we have adapted."" Hatters was able to continue operating during the lockdowns, but it ""pivoted"" away from events and conferences to supplying products for companies looking to improve staff engagement. Ms Shippen said she had been ""really lucky"" that her staff were ""understanding"" about being furloughed. Under the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme (CJRS), known as furlough, staff receive 80% of their current salary, capped at Â£2,500 a month. Furlough will be wound down further from Sunday as the government asks firms to make a bigger contribution. Since 1 July, employers have been asked to contribute 10% towards the wages of furloughed workers for hours their staff do not work. That amount will rise to to 20% in August and September. The scheme, drawn up after lengthy talks with business groups and union leaders, has cost taxpayers almost Â£50bn to date, arousing fearstaxes will have to rise to pay for it. Since the start of the scheme, a cumulative total of 11.6 million jobs have been supported by the CJRS at various times. It is credited with stopping a spike in unemployment and some fear jobs will be lost when it ends. But according to Tony Wilson, director of the Institute of Employment Studies, the number of people on furlough has been ""dropping like a stone"" as industries start to reopen, while fears of a ""rush of redundancies"" have been unfounded. ""Either employees are being brought back to work by their employers or they are being taken off furlough and leaving the labour market,"" Mr Wilson told the BBC. ""That could be young people going into full-time education rather than seeking work."" However, he noted some industries would be more exposed than others when the scheme finally ends, while support jobs such as office cleaning, security and delivery could also be lost if workers do not go back to the office in the same numbers because of the rise in home working. ""The answer is not extending furlough, but re-skilling people to take up the record number of new vacancies being advertised,"" Mr Wilson said. The top five industry groups with the highest rates of jobs being put on furlough at 31 May 2021: Air passenger transport (57%) Hotels and similar accommodation (57%) Travel agency and tour operator activities (51%) Photographic activities (43%) Beverage serving activities (43%) Source: ONS Tom Waters, senior research economist at the Institute for Fiscal Studies, said there was ""no way to know exactly"" how many jobs would have been lost, and for how long, had the furlough scheme not existed. ""But given that unemployment has only risen slightly since the start of the pandemic, despite the biggest fall in GDP ever recorded, I think it's fair to say that furlough has had a very significant impact on job retention,"" he added. The Trades Union Congress said it was ""great"" so many people had been able to return to work from furlough, but added some firms still required it. ""Doubling the employer contribution is too much too soon, putting jobs at risk in some parts of the economy,"" said Frances O'Grady, the union's general secretary. Laura Kearsley, head of employment law at Nelsons Solicitors, believes a lot of employers will review their workforce in the light of the furlough support being removed. She thinks that might result in an uptick in redundancies. ""I think we will see a lot of employers trying to agree measures that keep people in a job, such as reductions in pay or reductions in hours, changes in operating models,"" she said. She had this advice for those fearing redundancy: ""Find out about your rights. Dig out your employment contract, whatever you signed when you joined. ""Also ask for a company handbook or policy information about redundancy, that should set out what you can expect if you do find yourself in that situation."" Are you currently on furlough?

"The funding will allow an extra 88 million children to go to school Investing in education in the world's poorest countries is the ""single best investment we can make in the future of humanity"", Boris Johnson told a global education summit in London. World leaders pledged more than $4bn (Â£2.9bn) to support schools through the Global Partnership for Education. Nobel Prize winner Malala Yousafzai told the summit girls in particular faced an ""education crisis"". But charities warned the UK's aid cuts had harmed fundraising efforts. The Global Partnership for Education, which distributes funding in more than 90 poorer countries, wanted to raise $5bn (Â£3.6bn) to create an extra 88 million school places and support the learning of 175 million children during the next five years. Pledges at the summit, hosted by the UK and Kenya, included: Â£595m from the European Union Â£430m from the UK Â£300m from Norway Â£173m from Canada Â£218m over three years from the United States Julia Gillard, former Australian prime minister and chair of the education aid organisation, was confident that the full $5bn would be raised, but different national budget cycles would mean it would arrive in stages. School aid for Syrian children who know warplanes and not shops PM pledges Â£430m for girls' education at G7 Government wins vote to cut overseas aid She said the pandemic had disrupted education in all countries - but the impact of closing schools had been much worse in poorer countries where many families lacked access at home to internet connections or electricity. Malala Yousafzai told the summit improving education had to be a key part of pandemic recovery The UK prime minister hailed the fundraising initiative, saying investing in international education projects was a way of tackling ""ignorance and prejudice"" and boosting the economies of poorer countries. ""I'm immensely proud of the achievements of this summit today and I'm proud of what the UK has been able to contribute in spite of the difficult financial circumstances,"" Mr Johnson said. Improving access to good quality education, particularly for girls, was the ""panacea, the universal cure,"" the prime minister said. ""This is the Swiss Army knife, complete with Allen key, a screwdriver and everything else,"" he told the summit. But charity Save the Children said the fundraising drive had lost leverage because of the UK's own aid cuts, which had left it with ""diminishing leadership on the world stage"". The One anti-poverty campaign warned of a ""decidedly underwhelming result"", saying the UK's overseas aid cut had ""damaged our credibility"". Gabriela Bucher, executive director of Oxfam, questioned the priorities of a world in which billionaires could compete in launching private space rockets while millions of children are unable to go to school. She also warned of the negative impact from the UK ""dramatically cutting aid"". Malala Yousafzai told the summit of the importance of investing in education for girls in countries where they had fewer opportunities ""just because of their gender"". ""The world is facing a girls' education crisis,"" the education campaigner said, with more than 130 million out of school around the world and millions more at risk of not returning after the pandemic. ""Their futures are worth fighting for,"" she told the summit. Kenya's president, Uhuru Kenyatta, told the conference the fundraising event could ""avert an education catastrophe"". Angel Mbuthia says the pandemic has shown that problems do not stop at borders ""Education is the best equaliser,"" says Angel Mbuthia, a Kenyan campaigner for access to education, who is supporting the global education summit. The 26-year-old student leader, currently secretary for gender at the All Africa Students' Union, says education provides a ""ripple effect in giving solutions to our most pressing problems"". For instance improving health education is more cost effective than having to treat serious illnesses. ""Once you have a citizenry that is well-educated, they're able to take more preventative measures,"" she says. Preventing youth unemployment, creating more hi-tech industries, ""political awareness"" and promoting gender equality in Kenya will all depend on improving education, she says. ""It's a bedrock, the best foundation,"" she says, Angel supports campaigns for girls to have fair access to education, in rural areas as well as cities, and wants that to lead to fair representation in areas such as politics and the legal system. She argues that events such as the global summit need to give a voice to those who are excluded from a chance of education. In terms of whether donor countries should fund education elsewhere, she says individual countries cannot only look within their own borders - because international issues will still affect them, whether it's refugees, Covid or climate change. ""That's one realisation we've had from Covid-19,"" she says. An outbreak in China is now ""affecting someone in a very rural part of Kenya"". ""We have a responsibility to be global citizens, to talk about these issues,"" she says.

"Those travelling into Northern Ireland will have to be double vaccinated with accredited vaccines People who have been fully vaccinated in the EU or the US will not need to self-isolate when entering Northern Ireland from Monday. This easing of the Covid-19 travel rules is in line with changes made in England, Scotland and Wales. The Northern Ireland Executive also decided to allow international cruises to restart from 31 July. Students arriving from red-list countries will be put into managed isolation facilities. The pilot rollout for the expansion of the amber listed countries vaccinations policy is due to start on Monday 2 August. It means all those coming from the US or from EU countries (except France) will not have to isolate. There was also agreement that Villarreal football fans coming to Belfast for next month's Uefa Super Cup final against Chelsea would not have to self-isolate. A final decision to drop the wearing of masks in schools has also been delayed The executive has also agreed the 1m (3ft) social distancing regulation will be applied in indoor settings such as supermarkets and shopping centres from 18:00 BST on Friday 30 July. The 1m rule remains as guidance outdoors. What can I do as NI's Covid restrictions ease? It was also agreed that function rooms and community halls can put on live music from 30 July. Plans to reopen conferences and exhibitions have been delayed - that will be considered in August. A final decision to drop the wearing of masks in schools has also been delayed although earlier this month ministers said the wearing of face coverings may just be regarded as guidance when schools return. Since last August, post-primary pupils and teachers have been required to wear face coverings in school corridors and other communal areas. Earlier this week the executive agreed theatres and concert venues could reopen More discussions will take place between officials the Department of Health and the Department of Education. The proposals to ease restrictions at borders were discussed against a backdrop of increasing coronavirus-related pressures in Northern Ireland's hospitals. On Wednesday, BBC News NI reported thatsome cancer surgeries in Belfast were being cancelledin order to expand the number of staff caring for Covid-19 patients. The rule change on travel - which will come into force in England, Scotland and Wales from 04:00 on Monday - applies to people who have had both jabs of a vaccine approved by the EU or the US. Travellers will still need to take either a lateral flow or a PCR (polymerase chain reaction) test pre-departure and a PCR test on the second day after they arrive. Under-18s will be exempt from isolation and some will not have to test, depending on their age. The Department of Health confirmed itsCovid certification service,externalfor people travelling abroad will resume on Friday morning after it was ""temporarily interrupted"" by a technical problem. The interim system allows people from Northern Ireland to prove they are fully vaccinated against Covid-19 to countries which require it for entry. With the app still not available, applications can only be made online through the NIdirect website However, the service went offline on Tuesday,leaving many people concerned about their travel plans. On Thursday, the department said the system would go online again from 09:00 on Friday and should only be used by those travelling on Sunday 1 August ""in the first instance"". With the app still not available, applications can only be made online through the NIdirect website. Applications would be processed manually, the department added, with applicants contacted by email in response. The department said it was resuming the service in a ""controlled and phased way"" and explained that ""further communication"" would be issued on Friday in relation to people travelling after Sunday. On Thursday, another 1,471 positive coronavirus cases were reported by the Department of Health - down from 1,600 on Tuesday. That includes samples taken in recent days, not necessarily in the past 24 hours. Two more Covid-19-related deaths were also reported. Northern Ireland's chief medical officer Sir Michael McBride urged people to use the health service wisely. Earlier this week the executiveagreed that theatres and concert venues could reopen, after initially delaying its decision. On Monday, as well as agreeing to the reopening of theatres and concert venues, ministers backed further modest changes to the restrictions, including: An increase in the number of people who can meet indoors, with 10 people from three households being allowed to meet inside a home Fifteen people from unlimited households being allowed to meet outdoors Close-contact services being allowed to operate without the need for pre-booked appointments Executive agrees theatre and concert reopening No quarantine for fully jabbed EU and US arrivals What can I do as NI's Covid restrictions ease?

"Planning permission for the 34,500-capacity stadium was granted on Wednesday The cost of the proposed new Casement Park stadium in west Belfast could be more than Â£140m, First Minister Paul Givan has suggested. Earlier, the GAA (Gaelic Athletic Association) estimated the cost could be more than Â£110m. Planning permission for the 34,500-capacity stadiumwas granted on Wednesday. The GAA hopes work can be completed by summer 2024. Funding for the long-running project has yet to be agreed. Mr Givan's comment would place the cost at almost double the original estimate of Â£77.5m, the majority of which was to come from the Stormont Executive. The GAA has insisted it does not intend to increase its Â£15m contribution. On Thursday, Mr Givan told BBC News NI: ""That figure of Â£110m is based upon 2019. ""We are looking at around a 25% inflationary figure for capital projects and so if you put that on to Casement Park, you may well be looking at more like a Â£140m or Â£150m price tag."" Asked if he would still support the project, he said: ""In principle, Casement Park should be redeveloped but I think it would be churlish of any government not to be looking at all the costs associated with capital projects."" Mr Givan said no decisions could be made until the price of the project was worked out. Earlier, Stephen McGeehan, head of operations at Ulster GAA, told BBC News NI: ""It will be more than Â£110m, there's no question about that because those costs are based on summer 2019. ""Clearly we're now two years further on from that so costs have increased. ""The final cost will be determined in the business case."" Stephen McGeehan said the GAA had waited a long time for the project to be delivered The GAA hopes some work can begin on the new stadium before the end of the year, with major construction work starting in the first half of 2022. Discussing the organisation's contribution to the cost of the project, Mr McGeehan said: ""Clearly this is a very challenging time for the public sector, but it's also very challenging for organisations like the GAA. ""We reduced our income last year by something of the circa of â¬60m (Â£51m). We're due to have shortfalls in our budgets this year. ""People should also remember this is an executive programme. ""Soccer have had their strategic requirements delivered at Windsor Park, similarly at Ravenhill [for rugby], and we congratulate them for that, and we now have waited an awful long time for that to happen for the GAA."" This video can not be played Stormont should cover the extra cost of rebuilding Casement Park, says Infrastructure Minister Nichola Mallon As well as the financial issues, another difficulty facing the Casement Park project is potential legal action by a group of residents opposed to the new stadium. They have in the past argued that the stadium is too large to be built in a heavily-populated area. Planning permission for a 38,000-seater stadium was granted in 2013 but later overturned as a result of a judicial review. Since then, the design of the proposed stadium has been changed and the capacity reduced. The GAA said it was now going to hold a ""brand new community engagement programme"". Mr McGeehan said: ""We are going to meet with all of the local community, we're going to meet with all local businesses, all local residents, we're going to put our case back to them."" He said he believed the project would have long-term economic, community and social benefits, and create jobs in the area. The west Belfast residents' group which has been campaigning against the new stadium has so far made no comment about the granting of planning permission.

"Sun Dawu runs one of the country's largest private agricultural businesses in the northern province of Hebei. A prominent Chinese billionaire has been sentenced to 18 years in prison, the latest in a string of punishments against outspoken corporate bosses. Sun Dawu runs one of the country's largest private agricultural businesses in the northern province of Hebei. Sun, 67, has in the past spoken out about human rights and politically sensitive topics. He was found guilty of ""picking quarrels and provoking trouble"" - a charge often used against activists. Other charges against him include illegally occupying farmland, assembling a crowd to attack state agencies and obstructing government workers from performing their duties. He was also fined 3.11 million yuan ($478,697; Â£343,227). Sun's company is among China's biggest, with businesses ranging from meat processing and pet food to schools and hospitals. He was reportedly detained last year, along with 20 relatives and business associates, over a land dispute with a government-run farm. At the time, he said dozens of his employees were injured in an incident with police related to the dispute, according to an AFP report. Sun is said to be close to some prominent Chinese political dissidents and has in the past criticised the government's rural policies. He was one of the few people to openly accuse the government of covering up an African swine flu outbreak, which affected his farms in 2019, and later devastated much of the country's industry. He also was sentenced to prison in 2003, for ""illegal fundraising"" but the case was overturned after an outpouring of support from activists and the public. Sun reportedly denied many of the accusations against him in a pre-trial hearing, describing himself as an ""outstanding Communist party member"". He did however reportedly admit to making mistakes, including posting messages online. ""The way they're investigating me now is making those close to us suffer and those who hate us rejoice. I wish to take the charges upon myself, even if they're severe, in exchange for the release of others. We are people who have made contributions to society,"" he said.

Thank you for
joining us. It was brought to you by Owen Amos, Lauren Turner, Francesca Gillett, Mary O'Connor, Ashitha Nagesh, Jen Meierhans, Steffan Powell, Sophie Williams, Emma Harrison and Jo Couzens. Weâll be ending our live coverage for today shortly but,
before we go, hereâs a reminder of todayâs main coronavirus headlines from the
UK and around the world: Nearly a third of young adults in England have still not had a first dose of a Covid-19 vaccine, figures show. Some 68.1% of people aged 18 to 29 had received a first dose by 25 July, according to estimates from NHS England, meaning 31.9% are likely to be unvaccinated - the equivalent of around 2.7 million adults under 30. The figures are a small improvement on the previous week, when 33.6% of 18 to 29-year-olds had yet to have a first dose. A breakdown of the age group by gender shows vaccine take-up remains lower among men than women - an estimated 73% of women aged 25 to 29 have had a first dose, compared with 66.3% of men. Among 18 to 24-year-olds, 70% of women are estimated to have received one dose, and 62.2% of men. All adults in England have been able to book a first dose since 18 June. Pakistan has set a deadline for all service sector employees to get vaccinated Governments in south Asia have announced new precautions as
coronavirus infections continue to surge through their populations. Pakistan has set a deadline of the end of August for all
service sector employees to get vaccinated - along with teachers and pupils over the age of 18. Officials in the country have also announced people who haven't been vaccinated won't be allowed into malls, schools, restaurants or government offices from 1 August, and will be banned from air travel. In India, a monitoring team from Delhi was despatched to the
state of Kerala, which now accounts for nearly 40% of active cases in India. Kerala was praised internationally for its success in tackling the first wave
of Covid early last year. As Bangladesh experiences its deadliest month of the
pandemic, it has also been hit by a surge in dengue fever. Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst An outbreak of Covid-19 at an international airport last week has now led to the identification of cases in at least 13 other cities across China,
including the capital Beijing. Last week, a number of airport workers tested positive at the
Nanjing Lukou International Airport, prompting flight cancellations
and delays. State media reported yesterday that 1,657 members of airport staff
were told to self-isolate and monitor their health for two weeks. Cases, however, quickly spread in Nanjing, and local officials
confirmed that the Delta variant was present in the city. There are now 171
confirmed symptomatic cases, and the local government has placed many
communities in Nanjing under lockdown. A massive testing drive covering the
cityâs 9.3m population is taking place. Cases have been identified in at least 13 cities Media are somewhat optimistic that China can handle this outbreak. Nanjingâs local health commission has said the majority of patients in the city are only exhibiting mild symptoms, thanks to huge uptake of vaccination. The national Global Times newspaper says that in the city, only three are seriously unwell. The paper adds, however, that cases linked to the Nanjing outbreak have now been identified in âat least 13 citiesâ including Chengdu and Beijing. Cases had already reached nine cities spanning five Chinese provinces yesterday. The state-run The Paper news website suggests that more cases may soon be appearing elsewhere. It says today that based on information circulated by health commissions, âthe trajectory of the Nanjing cases involves 26 cities in 15 provincesâ. Millions have received promised Russian Sputnik V vaccines, but deliveries are falling short of orders Countries across the globe say theyâve been let down by
broken promises and stalled deliveries of Russiaâs Sputnik Covid vaccine. Scores of countries signed deals to buy millions of doses of
Sputnik V, unveiled last year as the worldâs first Covid jab. But many countries, including developing nations, have reported
receiving only a fraction of the doses for which theyâve paid. Russia has championed Sputnik V as part of its âvaccine diplomacyâ
with developing nations. Criticism of the vaccine in the West is dismissed as âheinous
propagandaâ. Read

There has been a spike in demand for flights from America to UK since the government announced US and EU double-jabbed travellers arriving from amber list countries would not have to quarantine. Virgin Atlantic said it had had more than three times as many bookings for flights from New York to London compared with a week earlier, while total bookings across all its US to UK routes more than doubled. From 04:00 BST on Monday 2 August,EU and US passengers arriving in England, Wales and Scotland from amber list countries- with the exception of France - will not have to complete the 10-day quarantine period. Virgin Atlantic's chief commercial officer Juha Jarvinen said: ""Flight bookings are up by more than 100% week-on-week, with bookings from New York to London increasing by nearly 250%, compared to the previous week."" Mr Jarvinen added that the forthcoming rule change had ""increased consumer confidence"" but urged the government to ""go further"" by placing the US on its travel green list. This wouldallow unvaccinated passengers to avoid quarantine- provided they have proof of a negative pre-departure Covid test and take a second test on their return. Deputy chief medical officer Prof Jonathan Van-Tam told us earlier that around 60,000 deaths have been prevented in England as a result of the Covid vaccine programme. He also said an estimated 22 million cases have also been stopped - a ""truly massive"" success. His comments came in a special programme with Radio 1 Newsbeat listeners, including some who are worried about getting a jab. Prof Van-Tam said the more people get a jab, the less likely more lockdowns are. The chances of another lockdown will be ""much lower"" if a higher proportion of the population, including 18-25-year-olds, get their jabs, he said. He also said he can't know yet if there will be a fourth wave of Covid infections in the UK, but it's possible we'll have some ""bumpy"" periods in autumn and winter - not just with Covid, but also flu and other respiratory viruses. Read the full story here. PA Media Alix Dietzel, right, and her sister Rosa We've been hearing some of your reactions to the relaxation of quarantine rules in England. One mother says it will end a ""sad"" and ""scary"" time for people like her with family overseas. Dr Alix Dietzel, a lecturer from Bristol, has close family in Austria - where she was brought up - as well as in Switzerland, France and the United States. Seeing them has been largely impossible during the pandemic. New rules being introduced on Monday mean those who are fully vaccinated against Covid will not have to quarantine when arriving in England from the US, the EU and a number of other countries including Switzerland, making travel much easier. Dr Dietzel, 33, told PA News agency: ""I'm relieved - it's been a long time and I wasn't sure when we'd be able to see each other again. ""Although we're used to being apart, we see each other a few times a year normally. ""So not being able to travel is quite sad and sometimes scary, especially in an unpredictable pandemic."" Dr Dietzel says her sister Rosa has only met her 20-month-old daughter once.""It makes me sad, my family has missed so much of her life."" More reaction:No quarantine for fully jabbed US and EU travellers Reality Check With the Tokyo Olympics under way, new cases of Covid continue to be identified at the Games. Infections in Japan have been climbing for some weeks, and are approaching the levels seen during an earlier coronavirus surge in May. The BBC's Reality Check team has taken a look into cases in the Olympic bubble and across the country. Read more about that here. Israel is to become the first country in the world to offer
a third dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech coronavirus vaccine to people over 60, as
cases of the highly contagious Delta variant continue to rise. From Sunday, those who are eligible will be able to get a
booster shot - so long as they were given their second dose at least five months
ago, according to local media. The World Health Organization and the US Centers for
Disease Control said recently that people who had been fully vaccinated did not need a booster shot at this time. However, the Israeli health ministry has reported a decrease
in the Pfizer vaccineâs effectiveness against infection and a slight decrease
in preventing severe illness. Pfizer has yet to apply for emergency authorisation for a
third dose from the US Food and Drug Administration, though the company has
said it could do so as early as August. Almost 62% of Israelâs population of nine million has been
fully vaccinated. Earlier this week, Israelâs health ministry authorised the
limited use of the Pfizer vaccine for children between five and 11 years old who have a high likelihood of serious illness or death from Covid-19. Thelatest figures,externalshow that deaths have increased by 28.9% per
100,000 people from the previous week (16 to 22 July), with 499 recorded in the last seven days, a rise of 112. Cases have fallen 37.1% per 100,000 people from the previous
week, with 204,669 recorded between 23 and 29 July, a fall of 120,554. Another 43,873 people in the UK have had a first dose of
a coronavirus vaccine, the government figures show. In total, 88.4% of the
adult population has now had at least one jab. And a further 171,341 have had a second vaccine dose now. As of today, 71.4% of the
adult population has now had both jabs. There
have been a further 31,117 cases of coronavirus reported in the UK
today, according to thelatest government
figures,external. And
there have been another 85 deaths, of people who had tested
positive for the virus within the previous 28 days. The prime minister appreciates the impact of the so-called pingdemic and says the expansion of daily testing for critical workers will help more industries to keep moving, No 10 says. The prime minister's official spokesman, speaking a little earlier, says the app continues to do what
it's designed to do. That is breaking chains of transmission, stopping people infected with
virus going out and passing it on - and the government continues to ask people to isolate if told
to do so. He says 260 testing sites are open to support workers in critical industries to avoid having to self-isolate if they come into contact with a positive coronavirus case by being tested each day before work. The provision is being put in place to support critical sectors before a widespread quarantine exemption for fully vaccinated people is brought in on 16 August. The PM's official spokesman says: ""We now have over 260 of these sites providing testing and we are in the process of establishing 800 further.""Following them, we will then establish the remaining 1,200 over the coming days. ""As we said when we set this out, our intention is to get these up and running as quickly as possible so we can ensure industries that provide the critical service they provide can continue to do so."" Robert CuffeBBC head of statistics The number of pings has been going up - but not as quickly as the number of cases. If we look at the number of times people have been checking into venues, that has fallen pretty significantly from about 14m at the start of June to just over 6.5m in the week ending 21 July. When all legal restrictions were lifted on 19 July, you no longer had to check in so some of that last fall may be because restaurants and pubs aren't making you do it any more, but you do see a pretty clear pattern there. It could be that people are maybe being just a little bit more careful, they're going into restaurants a little bit less. Or they're getting pinged less because when they're sitting beside somebody they very carefully move their phone 2m away - or switch it off. We don't have clear data on that but when you combine the fall in the number of check-ins and the fact that we are seeing fewer pings per person who tests positive, it's starting to paint a picture of less use of the app - or certainly less bringing your phone with you. As we've reported today, while fully vaccinated visitors from the EU and US will be allowed to enter England without quarantining, this won't apply to France - a rule that will only be reviewed at the end of next week. Now, France's Europe Minister Clement Beaune has branded the move ""discriminatory"". ""It's excessive, and it's frankly incomprehensible on health grounds,"" he said on LCI TV. ""It's not based on science, and it's discriminatory towards the French... I hope it will be reviewed as soon as possible, it's just common sense."" He added that France wasn't planning any tit-for-tat measures, ""for now"". The UK says it's keeping quarantine rules for travellers from France because of the presence of the Beta variant there, but French officials say most of the Beta cases are in French overseas territories. Sydney is about to enter its sixth week of lockdown Meanwhile, in Australia, the state of New South Wales has recorded 239 new cases - the highest daily rise since the start of the pandemic. Sydney is about to enter its sixth week of lockdown following a rise in cases there. People living in eight hot spots in the city have been ordered to wear masks outdoors and must stay within 5km of their homes. New South Wales Police says it has asked for 300 military members to help enforce lockdown restrictions. State Premier Gladys Berejiklian has warned that things are likely to get worse before they get better. As we've been reporting, a record number of people in England and Wales have beenadvised to self-isolate by the NHS Covid app in the week to 21 July. But how does the NHS Covid app work? If you spend enough time close to another person using it, you will receive a ""ping"" alert if they test positive for Covid. You need to be 2m (6ft) from them for 15 minutes to trigger a message. If you are ""pinged"" you're advised - but not legally obliged -to self-isolate until 10 days have passed since your contact with them. The UK government has said it is ""crucial"" to self-isolate when sent an alert. Northern IrelandandScotlandhave separate apps. What's been the impact of the record pings? Supermarkets, pub chains, transport networks, council bin collection services and firms say they have struggled with staff shortages due to the high number of employees self-isolating. In England, employers providing critical services can now request an exemption for named employees who are fully vaccinated.Sectors include energy and emergency services,external. Supermarket depot workers and food manufacturers are exempt from quarantine rules whatever their vaccination status. A similar system is being launched in Scotland. You can read our full explainerhere. Robert CuffeBBC head of statistics This figure is a bit of an
exaggeration, since it asks what would happen in a world with no vaccination
and no new lockdowns. But it shouldnât be
surprising for such a model to suggest that vaccines could have saved many tens
of thousands of lives in England alone. The modellers behind the
figure looked at the number of infections weâve seen since the start of the
year. They then asked how many of
those infected people would have died if the death rates from 2020 still
applied. That alone could account for
thousands of deaths: weâre seeing case rates last seen in December and January
when tens of thousands of people died. Since the vaccine also slows
the spread of the virus a bit, the modellers then add something on for the
infections that the vaccine has prevented, and the deaths they would have caused. Had we seen deaths returning
to those winter levels, there almost certainly would have been a return to
lockdowns. So a model that assumes there
wouldnât overstates the death toll that the vaccination program has spared us. A short while ago, Prof Jonathan Van-Tam told the BBC the vaccine rollout has prevented 22m cases of Covid and 60,000 deaths, according to Public Health England (PHE). Those figures are for England and cover the period up to 23 July, based onresearch carried out by PHE and Cambridge University,external. Vaccines are also estimated to have directly averted more than 52,600 hospital admissions. Previous estimates, for the period up to 9 July, had suggested about 37,000 deaths and 11,000,000 infections had been prevented. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Teachers have faced lobbying from some parents over this year's grades, suggests research by a leading social mobility charity Parents of pupils in private schools or living in affluent areas of England were the most likely to put pressure on teachers over exam grades, suggests research fromthe Sutton Trust.,external Almost a quarter of private school teachers had been contacted by parents over A-level and GCSE grades, twice as many as in schools in deprived areas. Teachers submitted grades this year after exams were disrupted by Covid. Head teachers warned such lobbying was ""inappropriate"" and added stress. The research, based on a survey of 3,200 teachers, showed teachers in private schools came under the greatest pressure, with the highest number, 23%, reporting parents contacting them over exam grades. But there was also a social gap between state schools, with 17% of teachers in better-off areas facing pressure from parents, compared with 11% in disadvantaged areas. Teachers' grades used for cancelled exams Students offered cash to defer university places Parents urged to trust teachers over grades Geoff Barton, leader of the ASCL head teachers' union, said parents lobbying for their children ""think they are doing the best for their children, but it is yet another issue which has added to the stress of an extremely stressful period"". But he reassured students that grades were based on objective evidence - ""rather than whose parents have the sharpest elbows"". Mr Barton had previously warned the education select committee that some parents were threatening to involve lawyers over grades and that schools were expecting a ""huge number of appeals"". A-level and GCSE results will be published in a couple of weeks Schools submitted their judgements on grades last month - and the final results will appear in a couple of weeks, with forecasts of an increase in top grades, which could put pressure on university places. Researchers found that half of students applying to university were worried that the disruption caused by the pandemic and the replacement grading system would negatively affect their chance of getting into their first choice university. But Paul Whiteman, leader of the National Association of Head Teachers, said parents and students should be confident of the fairness and ""rigour of this year's awarding processes and understand that it is inappropriate to put pressure on staff"". Schools have been able to use a range of evidence for grades, including ""mini-exam"" test papers, mock exams, homework and coursework - after the usual set of full exam papers were cancelled. The study from the Sutton Trust charity, which champions social mobility, shows how much variation there has been. Typically three or four ""mini-exams"" taken, but there were some schools taking more than six, while others were taking one, two or none at all. There were also warnings of the difficulties facing some pupils when they were studying from home - such as a lack of space to work and problems with internet connections and equipment. The report calls on universities to give extra consideration to students from disadvantaged backgrounds who narrowly missed their required grades. And there is a warning that this year's new students will need more support to settle in, after so many difficulties from the pandemic and when students might not have been able to visit universities on open days. ""This year's cohort of university applicants have faced almost two years of disrupted education. As we approach results day, it's vital that poorer students are not disadvantaged by the greater impact of the pandemic on them,"" said Sutton Trust founder Sir Peter Lampl. He also backed suggestions to change the timetable for university applications, so that students could apply once they knew their grades. A Department for Education spokeswoman said: ""Students have only been assessed on what they had been taught, supporting students who may not have had the opportunity to learn as much as they would do in a normal year and meaning that teachers have effectively made their assessments based on every student having their best day. ""No teacher should be put under undue pressure and grades are subject to wider internal checks in schools and external checks by exam boards to make sure they are a fair reflection of students' work.""

"Those travelling into Northern Ireland will have to be double vaccinated with accredited vaccines People who have been fully vaccinated in the EU or the US will not need to self-isolate when entering Northern Ireland from Monday. This easing of the Covid-19 travel rules is in line with changes made in England, Scotland and Wales. The Northern Ireland Executive also decided to allow international cruises to restart from 31 July. Students arriving from red-list countries will be put into managed isolation facilities. The pilot rollout for the expansion of the amber listed countries vaccinations policy is due to start on Monday 2 August. It means all those coming from the US or from EU countries (except France) will not have to isolate. There was also agreement that Villarreal football fans coming to Belfast for next month's Uefa Super Cup final against Chelsea would not have to self-isolate. A final decision to drop the wearing of masks in schools has also been delayed The executive has also agreed the 1m (3ft) social distancing regulation will be applied in indoor settings such as supermarkets and shopping centres from 18:00 BST on Friday 30 July. The 1m rule remains as guidance outdoors. What can I do as NI's Covid restrictions ease? It was also agreed that function rooms and community halls can put on live music from 30 July. Plans to reopen conferences and exhibitions have been delayed - that will be considered in August. A final decision to drop the wearing of masks in schools has also been delayed although earlier this month ministers said the wearing of face coverings may just be regarded as guidance when schools return. Since last August, post-primary pupils and teachers have been required to wear face coverings in school corridors and other communal areas. Earlier this week the executive agreed theatres and concert venues could reopen More discussions will take place between officials the Department of Health and the Department of Education. The proposals to ease restrictions at borders were discussed against a backdrop of increasing coronavirus-related pressures in Northern Ireland's hospitals. On Wednesday, BBC News NI reported thatsome cancer surgeries in Belfast were being cancelledin order to expand the number of staff caring for Covid-19 patients. The rule change on travel - which will come into force in England, Scotland and Wales from 04:00 on Monday - applies to people who have had both jabs of a vaccine approved by the EU or the US. Travellers will still need to take either a lateral flow or a PCR (polymerase chain reaction) test pre-departure and a PCR test on the second day after they arrive. Under-18s will be exempt from isolation and some will not have to test, depending on their age. The Department of Health confirmed itsCovid certification service,externalfor people travelling abroad will resume on Friday morning after it was ""temporarily interrupted"" by a technical problem. The interim system allows people from Northern Ireland to prove they are fully vaccinated against Covid-19 to countries which require it for entry. With the app still not available, applications can only be made online through the NIdirect website However, the service went offline on Tuesday,leaving many people concerned about their travel plans. On Thursday, the department said the system would go online again from 09:00 on Friday and should only be used by those travelling on Sunday 1 August ""in the first instance"". With the app still not available, applications can only be made online through the NIdirect website. Applications would be processed manually, the department added, with applicants contacted by email in response. The department said it was resuming the service in a ""controlled and phased way"" and explained that ""further communication"" would be issued on Friday in relation to people travelling after Sunday. On Thursday, another 1,471 positive coronavirus cases were reported by the Department of Health - down from 1,600 on Tuesday. That includes samples taken in recent days, not necessarily in the past 24 hours. Two more Covid-19-related deaths were also reported. Northern Ireland's chief medical officer Sir Michael McBride urged people to use the health service wisely. Earlier this week the executiveagreed that theatres and concert venues could reopen, after initially delaying its decision. On Monday, as well as agreeing to the reopening of theatres and concert venues, ministers backed further modest changes to the restrictions, including: An increase in the number of people who can meet indoors, with 10 people from three households being allowed to meet inside a home Fifteen people from unlimited households being allowed to meet outdoors Close-contact services being allowed to operate without the need for pre-booked appointments Executive agrees theatre and concert reopening No quarantine for fully jabbed EU and US arrivals What can I do as NI's Covid restrictions ease?

"New T-level qualifications are being phased in from 2023 to replace BTecs and other vocational courses BTec qualifications should not be scrapped in England, say groups representing students and staff in schools, colleges and universities. The plea comes as the Department for Education confirmed plans to introduce new technical qualifications in England and scrap most BTecs. The department says the reforms will simplify and streamline the system. But education leaders warn getting rid of BTecs is ""reckless"", as it will harm the prospects of poorer pupils. Twelve organisations have written to Education Secretary Gavin Williamson urging him not to ditch BTec qualifications. They estimate that at least 30% of 16 to 18-year-olds studying for a Level 3 qualification in England (the equivalent of A-levels) are doing vocational qualifications such as BTecs. This equates to around 259,291 young people. The letter states that a review into the proposed changes ignored the widespread concerns expressed about getting rid of BTecs. GCSE results spike for 'class of Covid' T-level study to be worth three A-levels Vocational exams allowed to go ahead in England ""Many young people will be adversely affected by this proposal, but disadvantaged students have the most to lose, a conclusion that your department's own equalities impact assessment supports"", the letter warns. It describes qualifications like BTecs as ""engines of social mobility"" and cites research from the Social Market Foundation, which found 44% of white working-class students entered university with at least one BTec and 37% of black students entered with only BTec qualifications. The organisations say: ""It is impossible to square the government's stated ambition to 'level up' opportunity with the proposal to scrap most BTecs."" BTecs are vocational qualifications taken after GCSEs, providing work-based skills in a range of areas such as healthcare, business and engineering. Earlier this month, the Department of Education confirmed that apprenticeships, A-levels and T-levels - new, two-year technical courses which are the equivalent of three A-levels - will become the main options for pupils in England after GCSEs. As a result, funding for most BTec qualifications will be removed. The new system, which has been given the green light after a consultation with the education sector, students and parents, will be phased in between 2023 and 2025. But Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said it would be ""reckless"" of the government to ditch BTecs simply to clear the way for T-levels.

"Facebook has warned that it expects revenue growth to slow down ""significantly"" in the second half of 2021. The tech giant saw revenue rise to $29bn (Â£21bn) in the three months to 30 June, up from $18.69bn last year. Butit said,externalthat sales would slow ""as we lap periods of increasingly strong growth"". It had benefitted from firms targeting consumers with online ads during lockdown. Its shares fell as much as 5% in after-hours trading. Its founder and chief executive Mark Zuckerberg said: ""We had a strong quarter as we continue to help businesses grow and people stay connected."" The number of people using the social network monthly rose to 2.9 billion. And although its profits doubled to $10.4bn in the second quarter, the company cautioned that it expects ""year-over-year total revenue growth rates to decelerate significantly on a sequential basis."" Zuckerberg wants Facebook to become online 'metaverse' Instagram defaults under-16s' accounts to private The California-based company also pointed towards a number of other challenges it would face in the coming months, such as new privacy controls that Apple introduced in April. They are aimed at limiting advertisers from tracking iPhone users without their knowledge, which Facebook said was likely to have an impact on its income, particularly between July and October, and it has factored into its projections for how it will perform. If consumers opt out of being tracked, it makes it harder for firms such as Facebook to target adverts, which make up a big chunk of their revenue. Paolo Pescatore, an analyst at PP Foresight, said: ""It is apparent that the Facebook user base is skewed to iOS users and will continue to be negatively impacted from the iOS change. Other technology firms ""have seemed to navigate this challenge but all will see a negative impact longer-term"" he said. Facebook also faced several investigations over its handling of users' personal information, both in the UK and Ireland and overseas. In April, for example,the Irish Data Protection Commission launched an investigationinto a data leak in which the details of hundreds of millions of Facebook users were published online. Facebook said it was ""co-operating fully"" with the relevant authorities. Mark Zuckerberg recently laid out his plans to transform Facebook from a social media network into a 'metaverse' Despite concerns over privacy, Mark Zuckerberg recently laid out his plans to transform Facebook from a social media network into a ""metaverse company"" in the next five years. A metaverse is an online world where people can game, work and communicate in a virtual environment, often using virtual reality (VR) headsets. The Facebook boss described it as ""an embodied internet where instead of just viewing content - you are in it"". He told tech publicationThe Verge,externalthat people shouldn't live through ""small, glowing rectangles"". ""That's not really how people are made to interact,"" he said, speaking of reliance on mobile phones. Facebook has invested heavily in virtual reality, spending $2bn (Â£1.46bn) on acquiring Oculus, which develops its VR products. In its update to investors on Wednesday, it said it expects spending on investments such as the development of new products as well as on data centres and servers to total up to $21bn in 2021. Silicon Valley giants are facing increased scrutiny at the moment as profits rise and their reach expands. In the UK, a regulator calledthe Digital Markets Unit (DMU) has just started workon curbing tech companies' dominance by creating new codes of conduct for them. Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng said that the new unit, which will be based inside the Competition and Markets Authority, will be ""unashamedly pro-competition"". And in the US, President Biden signed an executive order earlier in July in a bid to promote further competition. It suggested that problems have arisen because of large tech firms collecting too much personal data, buying up prospective competitors and competing unfairly with small businesses. It included several recommendations such as greater scrutiny of mergers in the tech sector and barring unfair methods of competition on internet marketplaces. Sophie Lund-Yates, an equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said of the recent Apple update: ""This isn't the first time Facebook's stared down the barrel of a regulatory or privacy problem, and it won't be the last. ""No-one can say in good faith that Facebook faces a smooth road from here, but it's reasonable to believe Facebook's long-term investment case remains intact.""

"This video can not be played Argentina beat GB 17-12 in men's rugby sevens bronze-medal match Tokyo Olympic Games on the BBC Dates:23 July-8 AugustTime in Tokyo:BST +8 Coverage:Watch live on BBC TV, BBC iPlayer, BBC Red Button and online; Listen on BBC Radio 5 Live, Sports Extra and Sounds; live text and video clips on BBC Sport website and app. Great Britain sevens star Dan Bibby has described a planned future sevens programme as ""a joke"" after the team missed out on a medal in Tokyo. Great Britain lost 17-12 to a fired-up Argentina in the bronze match in Tokyo. The team's central contractsended in Augustas the Rugby Football Union cut costs amid a Covid funding squeeze. ""Being brutally honest, it's a joke. We have been offered eight contracts. Eight contracts is ridiculous,"" said Bibby. ""You are asking us to play against a team like New Zealand with eight boys on not much more than minimum wage. It's impossible. ""If they are not going to fund it, be grown-up about it, come out and say it. But not all this wishy-washy absolute nonsense. That is my view on it."" The English, Welsh and Scottish unions all said in December thatthey were reviewing their sevens set-up for after the Olympics. Rugby sevens is on the Commonwealth Games programme for Birmingham 2022, where the teams will compete separately instead of as Great Britain. The Rio 2016 silver medallists, who were without injured team captain Tom Mitchell, were denied a spot on the podium as Ignacio Mendy ran in a decisive late try in the third-place play-off. Great Britain could not match their podium finish from Rio 2016 after a tough build-up to Tokyo ""To be here in the first place is a bit of a miracle from where we were 12 months ago to now,"" added Bibby. ""It'd be lovely to have something tangible to show everyone and say this is what all that graft and hard work was about. But we don't care about that really - we know what went on, we know how hard we worked to just get the team together. ""That is bigger than any medal. I would trade all the medals in the world for the friendships that I have here."" Great Britain's preparations were thrown into chaos when they were told to find other jobs last summer. Their training has also been disrupted by a series of lockdowns that some of their international rivals, New Zealand in particular, were less affected by. As an emotional Mitchell watched from the stands, the future of the sevens programme, supported since December by a short-term commercial partnership between the National Lottery and the English, Scottish and Welsh unions, looked no more certain. Day-by-day guide to the Games Times and channels for BBC's live coverage Great Britain, beaten 29-7 by New Zealand in their semi-final earlier in the day, had led inside 30 seconds of their final game as Ben Harris went over. But Lautaro Bazan Velez broke blind to level before 21-year-old Marcos Moneta, the star of his side's extraordinary six-man win over South Africa in the last eight, stepped Dan Norton to cross. Ollie Lindsay-Hague scored after the interval for Great Britain, however Mendy's electric burst outside Alex Davis proved decisive.

Their first came five years ago when rugby made its debut in Rio and they won the same title. A nation of less than a million people and considerably fewer resources than most of their rivals, Fiji's offloading and pace proved too potent for New Zealand as they ran in four tries. Bristol's Semi Radradra, one of the best-paid players in the 15-a-side format, was an unused replacement as his less high-profile team-mates completed their title defence without him.

"This video can not be played Andy Murray and Joe Salisbury are beaten in the doubles quarter-finals Tokyo Olympic Games on the BBC Dates:23 July-8 AugustTime in Tokyo:BST +8 Coverage:Watch live on BBC TV, BBC iPlayer, BBC Red Button and online; Listen on BBC Radio 5 Live, Sports Extra and Sounds; live text and video clips on BBC Sport website and app. Andy Murray's bid for an Olympic gold at a third successive Games ended as he and Joe Salisbury lost in the men's doubles quarter-finals in Tokyo. The British pair lost 4-6 7-6 (7-2) 10-7 against Croatia's Marin Cilic and Ivan Dodig in the quarter-finals. Murray, 34, and Salisbury, a doubles specialist who reached a career-high ranking of three last year, were playing their first event together. Liam Broadywas the final Briton to fall after losing in the singles. The 27-year-old was a late call-up to the British squad after Dan Evans tested positive for coronavirus, and marked his Olympic debut with two victories including a fine win over Wimbledon semi-finalist Hubert Hurkacz in the second round. However, beating France's Jeremy Chardy proved a step too far and he lost 7-6 (7-3) 4-6 6-1 in hot conditions at the Ariake Tennis Centre. Serbia's world number one Novak Djokovic also moved into the quarter-finals and praised a decision by the International Tennis Federation (ITF) to move the start of play to 3pm local time from Thursday. Djokovic had been among the players to complain about the stifling heat and humidity, with matches having begun at 11am. Russian second seed Daniil Medvedev had trouble with the conditions in his win over Italian Fabio Fognini. The 25-year-old took a medical timeout on court and called the trainer on two other occasions, and chair umpire Carlos Ramos asked Medvedev if he was all right during the second set. ""I'm fine. I can finish the match but I can die. If I die will the ITF take responsibility?"" Medvedev replied. Day-by-day guide to the Games Times and channels for BBC's live coverage Listen to the latest Olympics Daily podcast Tokyo 2020 medal table Murray, who won the singles at London 2012 and Rio 2016, pulled out of the individual event with a minor thigh strain to focus on the doubles. The three-time Grand Slam singles champion forged an impressive partnership with 29-year-old Salisbury, who won his maiden major doubles title at last year's Australian Open. But they could not build on a lead of a set and a break as Cilic and Dodig turned the match around. ""I don't know if I'll get the opportunity to play again,"" said Murray. ""I've loved every minute of playing in the Olympics. I wished today could have gone differently. ""I had another chance with Joe to win a medal. We were so close, and that's what's disappointing. I would like to have done some stuff differently in the match to try to help out more. Very disappointed."" The British pair broke serve in the first game of the match, maintaining that advantage as Salisbury clinched the opening set with an instinctive volley on a Murray service game. Murray and Salisbury broke again for 3-2 in the second set and consolidated the advantage for 4-2, only to lose serve for 4-4 and see their opponents win the tie-break to force a decider. Momentum stayed with Cilic and Dodig in the first-to-10 match tie-break, with the Croats taking the second of three match points when Salisbury volleyed long. Djokovic is bidding to replicate Steffi Graf's 1988 feat of winning a 'Golden Slam' - all four Grand Slams and Olympic gold in a single calendar year One of the big questions in tennis circles is who will be able to stopDjokovicbecoming the first man to complete a 'Golden Slam'. Serbia's Djokovic has already claimed the Australian Open, French Open and Wimbledon titles this year, and moved into the quarter-finals of the Olympic men's singles with a 6-3 6-1 win over Spain's Alejandro Davidovich Fokina. Russian second seedMedvedevis one of those bidding to end Djokovic's hopes and is also through to the last eight after seeing off Italy's Fabio Fognini 6-2 3-6 6-2, despite his struggle with the heat.

German fourth seedAlexander Zverevbeat Georgia's Nikoloz Basilashvili 6-4 7-6 (7-5) and will face Chardy in the last eight.

"New T-level qualifications are being phased in from 2023 to replace BTecs and other vocational courses BTec qualifications should not be scrapped in England, say groups representing students and staff in schools, colleges and universities. The plea comes as the Department for Education confirmed plans to introduce new technical qualifications in England and scrap most BTecs. The department says the reforms will simplify and streamline the system. But education leaders warn getting rid of BTecs is ""reckless"", as it will harm the prospects of poorer pupils. Twelve organisations have written to Education Secretary Gavin Williamson urging him not to ditch BTec qualifications. They estimate that at least 30% of 16 to 18-year-olds studying for a Level 3 qualification in England (the equivalent of A-levels) are doing vocational qualifications such as BTecs. This equates to around 259,291 young people. The letter states that a review into the proposed changes ignored the widespread concerns expressed about getting rid of BTecs. GCSE results spike for 'class of Covid' T-level study to be worth three A-levels Vocational exams allowed to go ahead in England ""Many young people will be adversely affected by this proposal, but disadvantaged students have the most to lose, a conclusion that your department's own equalities impact assessment supports"", the letter warns. It describes qualifications like BTecs as ""engines of social mobility"" and cites research from the Social Market Foundation, which found 44% of white working-class students entered university with at least one BTec and 37% of black students entered with only BTec qualifications. The organisations say: ""It is impossible to square the government's stated ambition to 'level up' opportunity with the proposal to scrap most BTecs."" BTecs are vocational qualifications taken after GCSEs, providing work-based skills in a range of areas such as healthcare, business and engineering. Earlier this month, the Department of Education confirmed that apprenticeships, A-levels and T-levels - new, two-year technical courses which are the equivalent of three A-levels - will become the main options for pupils in England after GCSEs. As a result, funding for most BTec qualifications will be removed. The new system, which has been given the green light after a consultation with the education sector, students and parents, will be phased in between 2023 and 2025. But Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said it would be ""reckless"" of the government to ditch BTecs simply to clear the way for T-levels. ""Applied general qualifications give many disadvantaged young people an established route to higher education, apprenticeships and future careers."" James Kewin, deputy chief executive of the Sixth Form Colleges Association, said: ""Applied general qualifications like BTecs are popular with students, respected by employers and provide a well-established route to higher education or employment.
