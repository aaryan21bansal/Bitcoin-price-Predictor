"This video can not be played Ratko Mladic's trial in numbers Former Bosnian Serb commander Ratko Mladic has been jailed for life for genocide and other atrocities in the 1990s Bosnian war. Known as the ""Butcher of Bosnia"", Mladic led forces during the massacre of Bosnian Muslims (Bosniaks) in Srebrenica and the siege of Sarajevo. The UN tribunal in The Hague convicted him on 10 of the 11 charges. Mladic, 74, was not in court when the sentence was read out. He had been removed for shouting at the judges. ""It's a lie. Everything you said in this courtroom is a lie,"" he said. The outburst came after the judges rejected a request by his team to halt the proceedings because of Mladic's high blood pressure. Mladic has denied all the charges and his lawyer said he would appeal. Profile: The ""Butcher of Bosnia"" What is the case against Mladic? Mladic was the military commander of Bosnian Serb forces against Bosnian Croat and Bosniak armies. He had been on trial at the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) since 2012. It found that Mladic ""significantly contributed"" to the genocide in Srebrenica in 1995, where more than 7,000 Bosniak men and boys were murdered, the worst atrocity in Europe since World War Two. He was cleared of a second count of genocide in other municipalities. The other charges included war crimes and crimes against humanity. This video can not be played ""The soil here is soaked with blood"" - survivor Mevludin Oric Presiding judge Alphons Orie read out many crimes committed by troops under Mladic's command, including: Mass rapes of Bosniak  women and girls Keeping Bosniak prisoners in appalling conditions - starving, thirsty and sick - and beating them Terrorising civilians in Sarajevo by shelling and sniping at them Deporting Bosniaks forcibly en masse Destroying Bosniaks' homes and mosques At the end of the war in 1995 Mladic went into hiding and lived in obscurity in Serbia, protected by family and elements of the security forces. He was finally tracked down and arrested at a cousin's house in rural northern Serbia in 2011 after 16 years on the run. Mladic's days in the Scheveningen prison in The Hague have been taken up with playing chess, reading history books, watching TV and exercise. His usual chess rival is former Bosnian Serb President Radovan Karadzic, who was alsoconvicted of genocide and war crimes in the Bosnian warin 2016. Victims and their relatives watched the verdict in a memorial centre near Srebrenica, and erupted in cheers as it was read out. The group Mothers of Srebrenica said it was partially satisfied, and some relatives said Mladic deserved a harsher sentence. What now for Bosnia victims as Hague tribunal closes? Victims and their relatives watched the verdict in a memorial centre near Srebrenica The BBC's Anna Holligan in The Hague says victims filed out of the courtroom in victorious mood into the sunshine. Fikret Alic, the man whose skeletal image on the front cover of Time magazine shocked the world in 1992, smiled as he tucked into a cheese sandwich. He said he hoped Mladic's behaviour would mean the Serb general would go down in history as a coward who was not brave enough to face up to his own crimes. By Guy Delauney, BBC News, Sarajevo A relative mourns one of the Srebrenica massacre victims No cheers could be heard on the streets of the Bosnian capital ... ""The verdict won't make any changes,"" said Resad Trbonja, a native of Sarajevo who became a teenage soldier to defend the city during the siege, that left more than 10,000 people dead. ""What we need to fight now is the legacy of the war - we're still living it."" Read Guy's full report here. Chief prosecutor Serge Brammertz said the verdict was not a judgement on the Serbian people and that Mladic's guilt was his alone. UN human rights chief Zeid Ra'ad al-Hussein called Mladic the ""epitome of evil"" and said his prosecution was ""the epitome of what international justice is all about"". In early July 1995, Bosnian Serb forces besieged an area near the town of Srebrenica. It had been designated a United Nations ""safe zone"" and was being guarded by 600 lightly armed Dutch UN soldiers. The Serbs attacked from the south, prompting thousands of Bosniak civilians and fighters to flee north to Srebrenica. As the Serb advance continued, refugees fled north to the main Dutch base in Potocari. Gen Mladic summoned the Dutch commander, Col Thom Karremans, and demanded that the Bosniaks disarm to save their lives. LISTEN: Testifying against Mladic On 12 July, some 15,000 Bosniak men of military age broke out of the enclave. They were shelled as they fled through the mountains. Some were also killed after surrendering. Buses then deported an estimated 23,000 women and children to Bosniak territory, while the Serbs separated out all males from age 12 to 77. On 13 July the first killings of unarmed Bosniaks took place in the nearby village of Kravica. Over four days, up to 8,000 Bosniak men and boys were murdered by Bosnian Serbs at sites around Srebrenica. April 1992: Bosniaks take cover from shelling in Sarajevo Civilians in the Bosnian capital endured a brutal siege during 1992-1995 at the hands of Bosnian Serb forces, who fired down into the city from the surrounding hills. The death toll was more than 10,000.

"Natasha Gordon denies assisting in the death of Matthew Birkinshaw A man took his own life after entering into a suicide pact with a woman who left him to die alone, a court heard. Natasha Gordon, 44, denies encouraging or assisting in the death of Matthew Birkinshaw, who was found dead in his car at Rutland Water. Leicester Crown Court heard they made contact on an internet forum where the 31-year-old spoke of ending his life. Ms Gordon had attempted to encourage six others to commit suicide, the prosecutor said in court. During chats over the course of several days, Ms Gordon, of Paston, Peterborough, told postman Mr Birkinshaw she was prepared to be his ""suicide partner"", prosecutors said. In a message to Mr Birkinshaw, Gordon said: ""I really can't wait to go tomorrow, I hope you do not change your mind."" Mr Birkinshaw travelled through the night from his home in Walsall, West Midlands, to the defendant's home on 17 December 2015. During the journey, he was spotted on CCTV at services near Rothwell, Northamptonshire. He was found dead later the same day in his car near Rutland Water, the UK's largest reservoir. He died of carbon monoxide poisoning. Natasha Gordon is on trial at Leicester Crown Court The court was told Ms Gordon had left the car and walked to the nearby Best Western Hotel because she ""couldn't go through with it"". Prosecutor Tim Cray said the defendant had been active on a number of suicide forums in the year before she met Mr Birkinshaw. He said she had been seeking a ""suicide partner"" and was ""uber interested, if there is such a thing, in suicide"". Mr Cray said she was ""prepared to say to people she hardly knew"" that taking their own life ""was the right thing to do"". ""The evidence will show that within hours of meeting Matthew online, she was telling him she was prepared to be his suicide partner,"" he said. ""This is a million miles from a mercy killing. All the evidence shows she thought and talked about suicide and was prepared to tell people she'd just met that it was the right thing to do."" The court was told Mr Birkinshaw was in good health, part of a loving family and had a stable girlfriend. The trial continues.

"Kezia Dugdale is one of two late entries to the jungle camp Kezia Dugdale has made her first jungle appearance on TV programme I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here!. The former leader of Scottish Labour was introduced as one of two late-entry campmates on Wednesday's live edition of the reality show. Presenters Ant and Dec ended the programme with a ""teaser"" that Ms Dugdale and comedian and broadcaster Iain Lee would be joining the line-up. They are expected to be fully unveiled on Thursday's episode. Ms Dugdale admitted some of her political colleagues will be ""shocked and angry"" at her stint in the Australian jungle. She said: ""They will be angry because they will say I should be doing my day job and I am going to be away. I understand that anger. ""I've seen them be angry over similar things other people have done but I can't help but think that it is an amazing opportunity to talk to millions of people about the Labour Party, its values and how it is different. ""I am not going to talk about politics all the time but it is who I am, what I do and I can't help it."" The Edinburgh and Lothians MSP admitted she didn't reveal her reality show plans when she asked Labour party bosses for three weeks' off from Holyrood business. She said: ""I quit as leader and so there was no obvious person to ask for permission. ""I went to the two people who were running for Scottish leader (eventual winner Richard Leonard and losing candidate Anas Sarwar) and told them I was going abroad for three weeks to work. They were both cool with that. ""I will be back for the budget in December."" Ant (left) and Dec are again fronting the show from Australia Scottish Labour has announcedMs Dugdale will not be suspended by the partydespitenot being given permissionto go on leave to Australia. The Lothians MSP is expected to be paid tens of thousands of pounds, part of which she will donate to charity, along with her MSP's salary for the three weeks she is away. Ms Dugdale poked fun at her political colleagues and rivals when she revealed what scared her most about the prospect of going into the jungle. She said: ""I am used to dealing with rats and snakes but I've never had to deal with creepy crawlies before. ""I ran upstairs when I saw a spider the other day and I've got a big fear of birds that stems from when I saw a scary picture of a pigeon as a toddler. I was petrified and I've lived with that ever since. ""I know I am not totally useless but I will scream, shout and then get on with it."" This year's other contenders include boxer Amir Khan, ex-footballer Dennis Wise, Made in Chelsea's Georgia Toffolo and Stanley Johnson - father of Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson. They are joined by Coronation Street actress Jennie McAlpine and Hollyoaks actor Jamie Lomas, along with comedian Shappi Khorsandi, footballer Jamie Vardy's wife Rebekah, Saturdays singer Vanessa White. YouTube personalityJack Maynard left the show on Tuesday. An ITV spokesman said: ""Due to circumstances outside camp, Jack has had to withdraw from the show.""

"Stamp duty to be abolished for all first-time buyers up to Â£300,000 Official economic growth estimate is downgraded Business rate cut brought forward and Â£2.8bn extra for NHS in England Higher road tax for diesel cars - not vans - to pay for ""clean air fund"" Universal Credit - pledges made on reduced waiting and claimant advances Jeremy Corbyn calls Budget a ""record of failure with a forecast of more to come"" Chris Johnston, Claire Heald, Dan Macadam and Mary-Ann Russon It's been a busy day on Business Live covering the Autumn Budget, but all good things must come to an end. If you'd still like to read more, please check out ourBudget 2017 page. We'll be back bright and early at 06:00 on Thursday morning. Do join us for all the latest breaking news and analysis from the business world. The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) is not impressed withthe one-off tax on new diesel carsthat do not meet the latest emissions standards. The SMMT's chief executive Mike Hawes says there's a danger that ""mixed messages"" around diesel - all the stop and go if you like - will confuse the public: there are no additional taxes for the next six months, but then there will be an extra levy. All the while when we want firms and consumers to renew their vehicles with greener new ones, because he says that's ""the quickest way to address air quality concerns"". ""Manufacturers are
investing heavily in the latest low emission technology, however, it's
unrealistic to think that we can fast-track the introduction of the next
generation of clean diesel technology which takes years to develop, in just
four months. ""This budget will also do nothing to remove the oldest, most
polluting vehicles from our roads in the coming years.â Environment campaigners have been taking stock. A senior lecturer in marine biology at the University of Exeter Dr Ceri Lewis welcomed the chancellor's Blue Planet II-inspired pledge to use the tax system to tackle single-use plastics which are ending up ""in every part of the world's oceans, from the surface to the deepest part of the sea floor, and in the stomachs of every species of marine animals where we have looked for them"". He says it's ""a great step towards reducing the problem."" But the Green Party co-leader, Caroline Lucas, thinks a lot more could have been done: Allow Twitter content?

A former NHS doctor has welcomed the chancellor's announcement that an extra Â£2.8bn of funding will be put into the health service. ""What matters now is identifying where this
additional budget will be allocated. Ensuring the NHS is fit for purpose in the
long term must involve large-scale investment that will facilitate the digital
transformation needed across the NHS,"" said Chris McCullough, who is now chief executive of Rotageek - a firm offering data-driven scheduling. ""Employees must feel able to control their
work-life balance, or we will continue to see doctors and nurses switching to
agencies.â He sees a role for the kind of business he does, alongside all the other things the NHS could be spending more on.

This was a budget carefully crafted and designed to
show a compassionate government - when ultimately the Chancellor didn't have an
awful lot to give, says Roger Bootle of Capital Economics. He also tells the
BBC's Mike Johnson that the funds for Brexit preparations could be used to employ more customs officers and processing British goods moving across the continent. This video can not be played What will the funds earmarked for Brexit preparations be used for? As we reported earlier, the Mayor of London Sadiq Khan has been less than impressed by the Chancellor's Budget, saying that this is the ""most anti-London budget ever"". Philip Hammond pledged to spend Â£28mon mental health services, as well as to pay for a new community space and refurbishment of the Lancaster West estate in west London - where Grenfell Tower is based. Mr Khan welcomed the investment, but he felt that much more needed to be done apart from that. ""The government needs to do much more to help rehouse those families affected by the tragic fire and that should be done immediately,"" he told the BBC. ""The government must also support councils to help retrofit building with sprinklers as they can't afford to do that without national funding. ""It's crucial they get on and do this quickly to ensure every tower block in London is safe."" Tudor Aw, head of the UK tech sector at KPMG,
says that while it is good that the government is investing Â£500m into emerging technologies like AI and 5G in the Budget, it is important not to forget about existing core technologies that power the UK tech industry. ""In particular, the
UK has strengths in âold-schoolâ tech sub-sectors such as software, IT services
and semi-conductor technology,"" he said. ""Tech investment should therefore be made
in education, regulation, tax and other incentives to ensure our strength in
the tech sector is broad based and not just those areas that sit at the top of
the latest hype curve.â Simon JackBBC Business Editor Businesses don't like budgets much. They see the tinkering by the chancellor as a potential administrative burden as they adjust to new rules, thresholds and initiatives. On that basis they will have been pleased at what the chancellor didn't do. He didn't lower the turnover threshold at which small businesses must register for VAT; it remains at Â£85,000. And white van men and women around the country will appreciate the continuation of the fuel duty freeze on diesel as well as petrol, with the rise in vehicle duty limited to diesel cars only.

Phillipson, founder of student and graduate networkHelloGrads,external, says that the Budget is ignoring younger adults. âAbolishing
stamp duty for first time buyers is a head-turner. If it had been coupled with
measures to protect those in the private rental sector from soaring
rents and a lack of regulation, it might have been a more
millennial-friendly budget,"" she said. âInstead
we have a housebuilding plan, and those facing an unaffordable and largely
unregulated rental market are sidelined. âTo
court millennials, the Government needed to go far beyond token gestures like
an age extension to the 16-25 railcard. ""Gimmicks like this are an insult to a
generation thatâs facing a housing crisis, wages outstripped by inflation, and
not enough graduate jobs to go round for those leaving university and
shouldering a massive student debt.â Here's a reminder of what the Chancellor announced today... Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

It's bad news for Multiyork - the furniture retailer has gone into administration, putting 550 jobs under threat. The retailer will trade until Christmas at the earliest while administrators Duff & Phelps seek a buyer. Multiyork will honour all existing orders placed until 22 November and customers will be contacted by the retailer. Stamp duty will be abolished immediately for first-time buyers buying a home of up to Â£300,000, Chancellor Philip Hammond has said. For properties costing up to Â£500,000, no stamp duty will be paid on the first Â£300,000. The change will apply in England and Northern Ireland. The stamp duty cuts are not relevant to Scotland as it is devolved, and the change will only apply in Wales up until the end of March, which is when powers will be devolved to Wales. Read more here.

The government wants autonomous cars on UK roads by 2021, but how can we ensure they're safe? Disposable incomes are set to be Â£540 lower by 2023 than forecast in March and pay rates will not return to levels seen before the financial crash until the middle of the next decade, according to the Resolution Foundation. The living standards think tank said annual pay was forecast to be Â£1,000 lower and consequently the UK faced a 17-year downturn before wages returned to 2008 levels. The think tank warned that Philip Hammond has not taken sufficient action to ease the living standards squeeze, with welfare cuts over the coming years set to heap pressure on low-income families. Resolution Foundation director Torsten Bell said: ""The chancellor has been handed a massive downgrade to expectations for how fast Britain's economy can grow, knocking a full quarter off the growth we can expect over the next five years. While the result for the public finances is grim, the chancellor has chosen to take the extra borrowing on the chin and indeed to borrow more, including welcome new action on housing."" He added: ""The chancellor has made the wrong call to press ahead with a damaging freeze on benefits.

"The government will take steps to increase the tax it collects from firms doing business online, Mr Hammond has announced. From April 2019, technology groups such as Google and Apple will pay a new withholding tax on the royalty payments they make to their subsidiaries in low-tax jurisdictions. Mr Hammond also tightened rules to prevent online sellers avoiding VAT. These moves are expected to bring in Â£200m a year on average. HMRC will hold online marketplaces such as eBay and Amazon responsible if sellers using their platforms fail to pay Value Added Tax on their sales. All businesses operating on their sites will have to show a valid VAT number. The increased tax income from multinationals should raise Â£285m in 2019-20, but that amount is expected to fall in each subsequent year to Â£130m in 2022-23. The Budget statement said the payments would be due ""even if the group has no taxable UK presence under current rules"". It added: ""It will prevent multinationals from gaining an unfair advantage by locating an IP [intellectual property] in low or no tax jurisdictions and so will level the playing field."" The move is expected to have raised Â£800m by March 2023. Budget 2017 reaction and updates At-a-glance summary: Budget key points Sharp cut to UK growth forecast What the Budget means for you Alison Lobb, international tax partner at Deloitte, said: ""It will be necessary to be able to clearly distinguish 'digital' companies subject to the digital turnover tax from other businesses. ""Even harder will be determining the appropriate rate - left open in the position paper - so that it represents a reasonable proxy for tax on profits, and so that it doesn't deter cross-border trade. ""Any moves made by the UK are likely to be mirrored by other countries, so UK digital businesses operating overseas will be equally affected."" Tech giants and the taxman are playing a digital game of cat and mouse. As the Paradise Papers showed recently, big, international companies use various means to move money out of the Treasury's reach. Cash earned from an online sale made in the UK may not be taxed in the UK, or anywhere. Digital firms' intellectual property is often owned by companies in tax havens, so large royalty payments are funnelled offshore. The chancellor is trying to tax this flow of money, acknowledging ""digitalisation poses challenges for the sustainability and fairness of our tax system"". The Treasury isn't clear how its new digital tax will be enforced - it admits some companies have ""no taxable UK presence"". The forecast for falling income each year from the tax perhaps suggests the Treasury expects companies to find a way round the rule. This isn't the complete answer, but it is a highly symbolic announcement - ministers have had enough of global companies sheltering profits from tax. Chancellor Philip Hammond said: ""Multinational digital businesses pay billions of pounds in royalties to jurisdictions where they are not taxed and some of those relate to UK sales. ""This does not solve the problem, but it does send a signal of our determination and we will continue work in the international arena to find a sustainable and fair long-term solution."" The plan to ensure people and businesses selling through online marketplaces pay the correct tax comes afterwarnings issued to Amazon and eBaylast month about them profiting from sellers who were not charging VAT. A report by MPs estimated that up to Â£1.5bn in tax had been lost from these third-party sellers.

"The bones were dug up on Tuesday afternoon in the car park at Aldi in Stalybridge Suspected human remains have been dug up in a supermarket car park. Workmen unearthed the bones outside a branch of German discount giant Aldi in Stalybridge, Greater Manchester, on Tuesday afternoon. Speculation has been rife among locals, but police believe the site may once have been a burial ground connected to a former chapel. Greater Manchester Police (GMP) said tests were being carried out to confirm if the remains were human. A photograph shared on Facebook showed workmen and onlookers peering down a large hole surrounded by fencing. Police are awaiting the results of tests following the discovery The discovery prompted reaction on social media, with many making reference to the 2013 discovery ofthe remains of English king Richard III in a car park in Leicester. Twitter user Jane Browneposted:,external""Wow, which king is it this time?"" A Facebook user speculated the remains could be related to a burial site connected to a former Methodist church in the town. Edyth O'Connor wrote:  ""I remember the old cemetery around that area. It was all boarded up whilst they removed the remains."" Norma Roberts said: ""Canal street methodist [church] was where Aldi is now, and yes it was boarded up while all graves were removed to new locations. Or should have been.""

"British furniture retailer Multiyork has gone into administration Multiyork, the furniture retailer, has gone into administration, putting 550 jobs under threat. The retailer will trade until Christmas at the earliest while administrators Duff & Phelps seek a buyer. Multiyork will honour all existing orders placed until 22 November and customers will be contacted by the retailer. The chain employs 547 staff in 50 stores and a manufacturing site in Thetford, Norfolk. Employees were told of the collapse on Wednesday afternoon and the management team will stay in place. ""Multiyork is still open for business, still trading - it's very early days for the administration,"" a spokesperson for Duff & Phelps told the BBC. ""We're really hopeful we can find a buyer."" The administrators said that the 39-year-old upholstered furniture retailer had been affected by difficult trading conditions. ""Trading conditions for UK retailers continue to be difficult due to a number of factors including economic uncertainty, rising commodity prices, increasing business rates and the fall in value of the pound which has increased the cost of importing raw materials and products,"" said Allan Graham, a joint administrator at Duff & Phelps. ""This appears to be leading to a sharp fall in consumer confidence and less money being spent on discretionary items.""

"It is unclear whether UK citizens' data was breached as Uber has not said. The UK's information commissioner has ""huge concerns about Uber's data policies and ethics"" following a breach that exposed the details of 57 million customers and drivers. Uber did not tell anyone about the breachand paid a ransom to hackers to delete the data. Deputy commissioner James Dipple-Johnson said these actions were unacceptable. The ride-sharing company hasa resource page,externalfor those who may be affected. ""It's always the company's responsibility to identify when UK citizens have been affected as part of a data breach and take steps to reduce any harm to consumers. Deliberately concealing breaches from regulators and citizens could attract higher fines for companies,"" Mr Dipple-Johnson said. ""If UK citizens were affected, then we should have been notified so that we could assess and verify the impact on people whose data was exposed."" He said the Information Commissioner's Officer (ICO) would work with the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) to determine the scale of the breach and how it affected people in the UK, as well considering the next steps that Uber needed to take to comply ""with its data protection obligations"". Next year, EU countries will radically alter data protection laws to offer consumers greater control over the data they share with companies. The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) aims to impose huge fines on companies that conceal data breaches. Under the new rules, companies have to notify data regulators about a breach within 72 hours of becoming aware of a hack. They face fines of 4% of their global annual turnover or 20 million euros (Â£18m), whichever is higher, if they are found to be in breach of the regulations. Dean Armstrong, a cyber-law barrister at Setfords Solicitors, said: ""As Uber hasn't released its figures, we can't speculate as to the potential final cost of the fine, but it is fair to say the regulator would come down hard and under the regulations it would likely be in the tens of millions. ""The greater cost to Uber however would and will be in terms of reputation, which although harder to quantify than a fine could far outstrip any penalty handed to them by a regulator."" David Kennerly, director of threat research at security company Webroot, criticised Uber for paying a ransom to the hackers. ""Given the current climate around data security and breaches, it is astonishing that Uber paid off the hackers and kept this breach under wraps for a year. ""The fact is there is absolutely no guarantee the hackers didn't create multiple copies of the stolen data for future extortion or to sell on further down the line."" Raj Samani, chief scientist at security company McAfee said, as a regular Uber user, the news made him ""incredibly angry"". ""Uber has treated its customers with a complete lack of respect,"" he said. ""Millions of people will now be worrying over what has happened to their personal data over the past 12 months, and Uber is directly responsible for this."" ""In opting to not only cover up the breach, but actually pay the hackers, Uber has directly contributed to the growth of cybercrime and the company needs to be held accountable for this.""

"Sgt Emile Cilliers denies attempting to murder Victoria Cilliers The judge in the trial of an Army sergeant accused of trying to murder his wife by tampering with her parachute has warned the jurors not to ""bully"" each other. Nine women and three men have been deliberating since last Tuesday in the case of Emile Cilliers. Two jurors fell ill and were discharged after Mr Justice Sweeney issued a majority direction. Mr Cilliers denies two charges of attempting to murder his wife Victoria. Mr Justice Sweeney gave the direction on Tuesday to jurors at Winchester Crown Court, saying that he would accept majority verdicts. Ninety minutes after this, one of the jurors became ill. On Wednesday, the forewoman also fell ill, with both jurors dismissed after the judge received medical certificates. Emile Cilliers is accused of two counts of attempted murder of Victoria He told the jurors, who have now been deliberating for 23-and-a-half hours: ""Jury service is not easy; it never has been. ""By their very nature, some trials require jurors to address deeply sensitive human problems, and some discussions may be fierce or tempestuous, with powerful arguments and counter-arguments. ""In such cases, discussions by their nature will be exhausting. ""However, and obviously, all must remain within the proper bounds of discussion, and not amount to improper pressure or bullying."" Mr Cilliers, 37, is accused trying to kill Victoria, 40, who survived a 4,000ft fall on 5 April 2015. It is alleged he tampered with her parachute before the jump, causing her to plummet to the ground. Prosecutors also claim the defendant made another attempt to kill Mrs Cilliers by deliberately causing a gas leak in the family home days before the fall. Mr Cilliers denies two counts of attempted murder and another criminal damage charge relating to the gas valve. The jury will continue its deliberations on Thursday.

"This video can not be played How we are losing the night A study of pictures of Earth by night has revealed that artificial light is growing brighter and more extensive every year. Between 2012 and 2016, the planet's artificially lit outdoor area grew by more than 2% per year. Scientists say a ""loss of night"" in many countries is having negative consequences for ""flora, fauna, and human well-being"". A team published the findings in the journal Science Advances.,external Their study useddata from a Nasa satellite radiometer - a device designed specifically to measure the brightness of night-time light,external. It showed that changes in brightness over time varied greatly by country. Some of the world's ""brightest nations"", such as the US and Spain, remained the same. Most nations in South America, Africa and Asia grew brighter. Only a few countries showed a decrease in brightness, such as Yemen and Syria - both experiencing warfare. The nocturnal satellite images - of glowing coastlines and spider-like city networks - look quite beautiful but artificial lighting has unintended consequences for human health and the environment. In 2016, the American Medical Association officially recognised the ""detrimental effects of poorly designed, high-intensity LED lighting"",external, saying it encouraged communities to ""minimise and control blue-rich environmental lighting by using the lowest emission of blue light possible to reduce glare. The sleep-inducing hormone melatonin is particularly sensitive to blue light. A recent study published in the journal Nature,externalrevealed that artificial light was a threat to crop pollination - reducing the pollinating activity of nocturnal insects. Research in the UK revealed that trees in more brightly lit areas burst their buds up to a week earlier,externalthan those in areas without artificial lighting. A study published earlier this year found that urban light installations ""dramatically altered"" the behaviour of nocturnally migrating birds. Lead researcher Christopher Kyba from the German Research Centre for Geoscience in Potsdam,externalsaid that the introduction of artificial light was ""one of the most dramatic physical changes human beings have made to our environment"". The brightest parts of the UK are getting brighter He and his colleagues had expected to see a decrease in brightness in wealthy cities and industrial areas as they switched from the orange glow of sodium lights to more energy-efficient LEDs; the light sensor on the satellite is not able to measure the bluer part of the spectrum of light that LEDs emit. ""I expected that in wealthy countries - like the US, UK, and Germany -  we'd see overall decreases in light, especially in brightly lit areas,"" he told BBC News. ""Instead we see countries like the US staying the same and the UK and Germany becoming increasingly bright."" Since the satellite sensor does not ""see"" the bluer light that humans can see, the increases in brightness that we experience will be even greater than what the researchers were able to measure. Prof Kevin Gaston from the University of Exeter told BBC News that humans were ""imposing abnormal light regimes on ourselves"". ""You now struggle to find anywhere in Europe with a natural night sky - without that skyglow we're all familiar with."" Prof Gaston added that he found the continuing increase in light pollution curious. ""Usually,"" he explained, ""when we think of how humanity messes with environment, it's a costly thing to fix or reverse. The Nile and surrounding region are outlined by light at night ""For light, it's just a case of directing it where we need it and not wasting it where we don't."" Dr Kyba said that we could make our urban areas much dimmer and not actually cause any problems for visibility. ""Human vision relies on contrast, not the amount of light,"" he explained. ""So by reducing contrast outdoors - avoiding glaring lamps - it is actually possible to have improved vision with less light. ""That could mean big energy savings - but our data show that on a national and global scale, this is not the direction we are heading.""

"Ms Le Pen has been fighting for her political survival since losing France's presidential election to Emmanuel Macron Marine Le Pen has claimed her National Front party is the victim of a ""banking fatwa"" after banks closed its accounts as well as her own personal account. The leader of the far-right party told a news conference she would be lodging complaints against SociÃ©tÃ© GÃ©nÃ©rale and HSBC. Under French law, banks are allowed to close accounts unilaterally. But Ms Le Pen accused ""financial oligarchies"" of trying to ""suffocate"" the political opposition and democracy. ""This is a political decision on the part of SociÃ©tÃ© GÃ©nÃ©rale and not a dispute between a customer and their bank,"" she was quoted as saying after insisting the party's finances were stable. Ms Le Pen has been fighting for her political life since losing May's presidential election to Emmanuel Macron and performing poorly in subsequent legislative elections. Her party has been riven by feuds, she has been put under formal investigation over a European Parliament funding scandal, and earlier this month she was stripped of immunity from prosecution over a series of grisly images she published on Twitter. This is not the first instance of antagonism between the National Front (FN) and the banks. In 2014, it accepted Russian loans of â¬11m (then worth Â£9m or $15m) when French banks declined to lend it any money. It was also refused loans to fund its campaign for the presidency, and has subsequently appealed directly to supporters for loans. Marine Le Pen: Taking France's National Front out of the shadows What does Marine Le Pen do now? Ms Le Pen said the FN would be filing a complaint against SociÃ©tÃ© GÃ©nÃ©rale and its subsidiary CrÃ©dit du Nord. She also vowed to complain to HSBC after, she said, it closed her own personal account. None of the banks confirmed that they had taken these steps, citing rules on confidentiality. The FN's banking relationship with SociÃ©tÃ© GÃ©nÃ©rale is said to go back 30 years. In France, banks are allowed to close accounts without notice or explanation. However, access to a bank account is a right in France and the Bank of France can designate a bank which is then required to open an account. The FN's complaint against CrÃ©dit du Nord is that when it was required to open an account it then refused to process cheque and credit card payments, reports Reuters news agency.

"Up to the moment itself the extraordinary session of parliament had proceeded along expected lines. Speaker after speaker rose to denounce the excesses of the president and his wife. A female MP was speaking of how her constituents were suffering when we saw the messengers approach the speaker. They handed him a letter. A jolt of energy swept the hall. At first there were cheers of anticipation. The speaker rose. The next 10 minutes will remain engraved in my memory. We strained to hear the speaker through the muffled public address system. But the words ""statement of resignation"" were clear. And the wild cheering, the thumping of tables, the dancing and singing told all of us who were present that the age of Robert Mugabe was over. From the corridors outside where Zanu-PF activists had gathered, the MPs could hear loud cheers and singing mingle with their own celebrations. On the floor of parliament - a hotel ballroom specially converted for the session - I watched MPs and senators dance, arms around each other, as the solemn procession of mace bearers left the chamber. This video can not be played MPs cheered and celebrated as the resignation was announced Among the more bizarre experiences was finding ruling-party legislators offering themselves for interview to the BBC. A week ago most foreign journalists were banned from the country. One party stalwart, MP Keith Guzah, told me he believed real democracy would now take root in Zimbabwe. ""He has gone and I am happy, happy, happy for my country."" Another MP told me her greatest joy was that Zimbabwe had managed the transition ""without the shedding of blood."" It  was a comment that ignored the bloodshed and pain inflicted by her party during the decades of Robert Mugabe's rule. Latest updates Robert Mugabe: Hero or villain? Emmerson Mnangagwa: The 'crocodile' who snapped back Leaving parliament I moved up through the city towards Africa Unity Square, the heart of Harare, pausing several times as I was enveloped by ecstatic crowds. A man fell to his knees and raised his arms to the sky. A young woman, wrapped in the national flag, shouted: ""Do you see this you guys? Do you see this? It is history in the making."" On the square I ran into Ben Freeth, a farmer who lost his land and whose family were brutally tortured during the land invasions. Like so many others he was struggling to believe that the moment of Mr Mugabe's departure had arrived. ""He was going, going, going and now he's finally gone,"" he said. As we spoke a group of revellers approached. Suddenly we were surrounded by embracing arms. ""And you can see,"" said Ben, ""we are in this together!"" This video can not be played How news of Robert Mugabe's resignation was greeted across Zimbabwe Will this spirit of unity, this freedom from fear, endure under a new dispensation? I cannot be at all certain. The presumptive new leader, Emmerson Mnangagwa, is mired in the excesses of the Mugabe era. He was the deposed president's loyal henchman for decades and only struck against him to prevent Grace Mugabe from succeeding to the presidency. This was not a revolution to bring liberal democratic principles into government. It was about power. That said, there are significant pressures on the new leader to embark on a programme of meaningful change. The corruption and tyranny of the past will not attract the international financial aid and investment that is needed to rescue the nation's shattered economy. Mr Mnangagwa will face a strong challenge if he tries to mire Zimbabwe in the despotism of the past. His instincts are authoritarian but he will not have the same scope for repression as Robert Mugabe. It would be a mistake to regard Zanu-PF as a monolith. A party that turned on one leader can easily turn on another. Robert Mugabe's resignation letter interrupted impeachment proceedings against him Perhaps most important is the attitude of the people. They have endured nearly 40 years of fear. For the first time they have been able to speak openly and demonstrate in the streets. The opposition - for so long divided and beaten down - is rejuvenated. These are the moments in which new leaders emerge and are tested. With elections set for next year, all parties are already in campaigning mode. Traditionally the polls have been times of chaos and crackdowns.

"Zimbabweans want a ""happy new Zimbabwe"" - and the long-time ruling party Zanu-PF is anxious to assure them it can be the one to deliver it It's been a dramatic, inspiring, earthquake of a week in Zimbabwe. But if you're looking for evidence to show that what really happened was a ruthless reshuffle within the governing party, Zanu-PF, rather than any grander transformation in politics or society, it is worth having a chat with the local MP for Harare East. I met the Honourable Terence Mukupe in the garden of the Meikles Hotel in the city centre, as his new party boss, Emmerson Mnangagwa, was poised to return to the country, and a fellow Harare MP was busy being dragged off, in tears, by plain-clothed security agents in the hotel lobby. ""That's a signal to the public that we really mean business,"" said Mr Mukupe, drily, of his Zanu-PF colleague, Shadreck Mashayamombe - reportedly a former aide to Grace Mugabe. ""There are going to be over 500 high-profile people that are going to face the music, be taken to court, and that's what Zimbabweans want to see. No sacred cows,"" he continued. Mugabe has gone, but will Zimbabwe change? Five things Zimbabwe's economy urgently needs Emmerson Mnangagwa: The 'crocodile' who snapped back Mr Mukupe, who says he worked for 10 years as an investment banker on Wall Street before winning his seat in parliament two years ago, is part of an ambitious younger generation of Zanu-PF MPs who have been at the heart of the internal power struggles that led to last week's military ""intervention."" Although he briefly sided with the G40 group linked to Grace Mugabe, he quickly and - as it soon proved - presciently switched to endorse her bitter rival Mr Mnangagwa. This video can not be played How news of Robert Mugabe's resignation was greeted across Zimbabwe Now Mr Mukupe foresees a Zanu-PF revival, with technocrats - like himself perhaps - brought in to the cabinet to fix the economy, and next year's national elections already a foregone conclusion. ""There's so much chaos within the opposition. Everyone is clear that Zanu-PF is going to win the election. It will be a landslide. So let's have change within Zanu-PF,"" he said. He mentioned Rwanda as an example to follow. ""People want to see technocrats. It should become a meritocracy."" ""We have a cancer in this society,"" Mr Mukupe told the BBC But what's most striking, to an outsider, about someone like Mr Mukupe is his skill in disassociating himself from the disastrous failings of Zanu-PF and President Mugabe, and the repression and misrule that damaged the lives of so many millions of Zimbabweans. He readily admits there was ""violence perpetrated against opposition members and corrupt activities"", but insists that the blame lay squarely with President Mugabe. It's an argument that suits the party well these days, as it purges itself of ""cliques"" and ""cabals"". ""We have a cancer in this society. Our politics was about cults. Everyone was afraid of President Mugabe. Don't make it appear as if it's just the ordinary people, or people in opposition. ""Even people within Zanu-PF were afraid. He was the beginning and end of everything - he could hire you, fire you, imprison you, do all sorts of things to you. Not everyone could stand up and fight the beast,"" said Mr Mukupe. This video can not be played Mugabe: From war hero to resignation ""We should never have given him the sort of powers we gave him,"" he conceded, but insisted that no-one, including the opposition, had ""clean hands. ""It's a collective responsibility. Everybody played some role in the demise of this country."" It's easy to see now how Zanu-PF will run with that message in the months ahead, as the country heads towards elections. Some would argue that it is more spin than truth - a convenient re-writing of history by the winning team. But there is every chance that many Zimbabweans, still tied to Zanu-PF by history and familiarity, will choose to give it another opportunity to correct itself.

"Serious work on restoring Zimbabwe's finances need to begin once the celebrations over Robert Mugabe's departure have ended Current events in Zimbabwe show that while a week may be a long time in politics, it is really a very short blink of an eye in economics. Zimbabweans on the streets of Harare and Bulawayo may be hopeful for political change, but they are much more sanguine and realistic when it comes to improving the country's economy. Presidents can be impeached in days or weeks. It takes years to wreck economies and usually even longer to repair them. So, will Emmerson Mnangagwa be able to take Zimbabwe's economy off life support and at least start to put it on the road to recovery? Analysts are very sceptical that a quick solution is even feasible. The euphoria that has gripped the nation has certainly raised hopes that the future will be brighter, but if that improved sentiment is to deliver economic dividends, the government needs to make some drastic reforms. Cash injection The first tool President Mnangagwa would need to even get a recovery kick-started is hard currency. Zimbabwe hasn't had a currency of its own since 2009, after hyperinflation killed off the old Zimbabwean dollar. Zimbabwe 100 trillion and 500 thousand dollar banknotes, produced after the country experienced a period of hyperinflation Zimbabwe has lost its status as the breadbasket of Africa Since then, the US dollar has been the main currency for transactions, as well as the South African rand. And in recent years a cash shortage has been slowly strangling the economy, which is half the size it was at the turn of the millennium. Ten numbers that will help you understand what's actually going on But who would stump up the cash? Western donors will remain wary of a Zanu-PF government which simply sees Robert Mugabe replaced by Mr Mnangagwa. The International Monetary Fund, which describes Zimbabwe's economy as one of the most fragile in the world, may be more willing - but only with many strings attached to any deal. China is possibly the most likely cash benefactor in the initial stages of a Mnangagwa administration. In some circles, Mr Mnangagwa is seen as Zimbabwe's Deng Xiaoping, the Chinese leader who instigated a degree of market liberalisation. Dump damaging policies and stamp out corruption Assuming the cash is forthcoming, what then? Mr Mnangagwa would have to dump economic policies that are unpalatable to foreign investors. Zimbabwe's agricultural production started to plunge after the government-sanctioned programme of farm seizures came into effect Zimbabwe has a potential labour force that is one of the most skilled in Africa In 2009, Mr Mugabe signed the Indigenisation and Economic Empowerment Act (IEEA) into law, which aimed to place 51% of companies into the hands of Black Zimbabweans. Even some Chinese companies have been forced to close their operations in Zimbabwe in recent years, because the IEEA made it unprofitable to do business in the country. Once considered the breadbasket of Africa, Zimbabwe saw its agricultural production start to plunge at the turn of the century after the government-sanctioned programme of farm seizures. Mugabe has gone, but will Zimbabwe change? Robert Mugabe: Hero or villain? Emmerson Mnangagwa: The 'crocodile' who snapped back Some sources claim that Mr Mnangagwa is keen to revitalise Zimbabwe's commercial farms, and may seek the help of white farmers to do it. Corruption has been a major restraint on economic growth in Zimbabwe for years. Much of the farmland that was seized from white farmers ended up in the hands of army generals and the political elite, who knew next to nothing about agriculture. The farms simply fell into disarray. Likewise, businesses that ended up with people with more political connections than entrepreneurial flair more often than not went to the wall. Three million Zimbabweans are estimated to live outside the country, having fled the dire economic conditions that emerged over the past two decades Not that corruption is confined to Zimbabwe in the African context, but it is one of those places that it seems to trickle down from the top. Just ask any South African who has driven their car across the border and been stopped at a police roadblock. But Mr Mnangagwa has not escaped the corruption criticism. It is alleged that he was at the top of corruption tree when the army effectively took over theMarange diamond fieldsin the east of the country in 2008. At the time, he was the defence minister. That whole affair raised the eyebrows even of Mr Mugabe, who said last year that he felt at least $13bn of revenue had gone missing from the diamond bonanza. Negotiate with foreign lenders For nearly 20 years, Zimbabwe has been in default on $9bn worth of international debt. That debt needs restructuring, probably with the assistance of the IMF and the World Bank. Perhaps a government that did not only include Zanu-PF could even get the debt (or some of it) wiped out. Mr Mnangagwa is thought to be open to a new deal with the IMF, but getting new financing and renegotiating old deals would probably be easier for a unity government which included opposition politicians, especially former Finance Minister Tendai Biti. Create the conditions to reduce unemployment and entice the diaspora to return Formal jobs in Zimbabwe are rare. Unemployment runs at more than 90%. Creating the conditions for investment and seeing that money flows in should have a dramatic short-term effect on unemployment. Western governments will be wary of a Zanu-PF government which simply sees Robert Mugabe replaced by Emmerson Mnangagwa (above) Other conditions already exist: the country has an abundance of natural resources in both agriculture and mining, and a potential labour force that's one of the most skilled in Africa. All it needs is the political will and the right economic conditions for Zimbabwe's unemployment statistics to become rather less stratospheric. Meanwhile, three million Zimbabweans are estimated to live outside the country, having fled the dire economic conditions that emerged over the past two decades. They too have skills which would be useful in the rebuilding of the economy. But they will have to feel they would be landing on solid and stable ground - both financially and politically. Otherwise, why go back? In addition, it could be argued that a Zanu-PF dominated government would not want them back this side of an election. The vast majority of the returning diaspora would be unlikely to vote for Mr Mnangagwa and his party. Create its own currency In the longer term, Zimbabwe needs to have its own currency. Using the US dollar was necessary after the old Zim dollar became worth less than the paper it was printed on and met its demise. Banks in Zimbabwe have been feeling the strain in recent months But there is so much more to creating a viable currency than switching on a printing press. Confidence is key. Last year, the Reserve Bank introduced ""bond notes"" which were meant to alleviate the chronic shortage of US dollars in the system. However, many thought this was an attempt to re-introduce the Zim dollar via the back door. Mugabe's long career in pictures The polarising Grace Mugabe How Zimbabweans celebrated In fact, the notes have done nothing to address the cash shortage and some analysts say they might have actually made the situation worse, by pushing up the demand for US dollars even further. Few people like using the bond notes, even though the amount in circulation is relatively low and the denominations are small. Putting money into a bank was no longer considered the soundest of options, because the cash could only be withdrawn in small amounts and there was always the fear that the Reserve Bank would come for your hard-earned dollars. So, the stock market soared, ironically becoming one of the best performing bourses in the world. Indeed, the rise in the stock market has only been curtailed by the army intervention and the resignation of Mr Mugabe.

"Emmerson Dambudzo Mnangagwa, the man known as ""the crocodile"" because of his political cunning, achieved a long-held ambition to succeed Robert Mugabe as Zimbabwe's president in November last year. He has now won a disputed presidential election to legitimise his rule, promising voters his efforts to woo foreign investors will bring back the economy from the brink of collapse. Mr Mugabe resigned following a military takeover and mass demonstrations - all sparked by his sacking of Mr Mnangagwa as his vice-president. ""The crocodile"", who lived up to his name and snapped back, may have unseated Zimbabwe's only ruler, but he is also associated with some of the worst atrocities committed under the ruling Zanu-PF party since independence in 1980. One veteran of the liberation struggle, who worked with him for many years, once put it simply: ""He's a very cruel man, very cruel."" But his children see him as a principled, if unemotional, man. His daughter, Farai Mlotshwa - a property developer and the eldest of his nine children by two wives - told BBC Radio 4 that he was a ""softie"". As if to reinforce this softer image of the new leader, a cuddly crocodile soft toy was passed among the Zanu-PF supporters who welcomed him back to the country after Mr Mugabe's resignation. Emmerson Mnangagwa is known as ""Ngwena"", the Shona word for crocodile And what he lacks in charisma and oratory prowess, he makes up for in pragmatism, says close friend and Zanu-PF politician Josiah Hungwe. ""Mnangagwa is a practical person. He is a person who recognises that politics is politics but people must eat,"" he told the BBC, adding that reforming Zimbabwe's disastrous economy will be the focus of his leadership. This video can not be played Emmerson Mnangagwa: Who is the man known as the âcrocodileâ? Known as ""the crocodile"" because of his political shrewdness - his Zanu-PF faction is ""Lacoste"" Received military training in China and Egypt Tortured by Rhodesian forces after his ""crocodile gang"" staged attacks Helped direct Zimbabwe's war of independence in the 1960s and 1970s Became the country's spymaster during the 1980s civil conflict, in which thousands of civilians were killed, but has denied any role in the massacres Accused of masterminding attacks on opposition supporters after 2008 election Says he will deliver jobs, and seen as open to economic reforms Survived several alleged assassination attempts, blamed on Mugabe supporters Find out more on BBC Radio 4's Profile. The exact year of Mr Mnangagwa's birth is not known - but he is thought to be 75, which would make him nearly 20 years younger than his predecessor who left power aged 93. Born in the central region of Zvishavane, he is a Karanga - the largest clan of Zimbabwe's majority Shona community. Some Karangas felt it was their turn for power, following 37 years of domination by Mr Mugabe's Zezuru clan, though Mr Mnangagwa was accused of profiting while under Mr Mugabe. According to a United Nations report in 2001, he was seen as ""the architect of the commercial activities of Zanu-PF"". This largely related to the operations of the Zimbabwean army and businessmen in the Democratic Republic of Congo. Zimbabwean troops intervened in the DR Congo conflict on the side of the government and, like those of other countries, were accused of using the conflict to loot some of its rich natural resources such as diamonds, gold and other minerals. More recently military officials - many behind his rise to power -have been accused of benefiting from the rich Marange diamond fields in eastern Zimbabwe, with reports of killings and human rights abuses there. Despite his money-raising role, Mr Mnangagwa, a lawyer who grew up in Zambia, was not always well-loved by the rank and file of his own party. A Zanu-PF official posed an interesting question when asked about Mr Mnangagwa's prospects: ""You think Mugabe is bad, but have you thought that whoever comes after him could be even worse?"" The opposition candidate who defeated Mr Mnangagwa in the 2000 parliamentary campaign in Kwekwe Central, Blessing Chebundo, might agree. During a bitter campaign, Mr Chebundo escaped death by a whisker when the Zanu-PF youths who had abducted him and doused him with petrol were unable to light a match. Those who fought in Zimbabwe's war of independence have long monopolised power Mr Mnangagwa's fearsome reputation was made during the civil war which broke out in the 1980s between Mr Mugabe's Zanu party and the Zapu party of Joshua Nkomo. As national security minister, he was in charge of the Central Intelligence Organisation (CIO), which worked hand in glove with the army to suppress Zapu. Thousands of civilians - mainly ethnic Ndebeles, seen as Zapu supporters - were killed in a campaign known as Gukurahundi, before the two parties merged to form Zanu-PF. Among countless other atrocities carried out by the North Korean-trained Fifth Brigade of the army, villagers were forced at gunpoint to dance on the freshly dug graves of their relatives and chant pro-Mugabe slogans. Mr Mnangagwa has denied any role in the massacres, but the wounds are still painful and many party officials, not to mention voters, in Matabeleland might find it hard to back Mr Mnangagwa. He does enjoy the support of many of the war veterans who led the campaign of violence against the white farmers and the opposition from 2000. They remember him as one of the men who, following his military training in China and Egypt, directed the fight for independence in the 1960s and 1970s. He also attended the Beijing School of Ideology, run by the Chinese Communist Party. Mr Mnangagwa's official profile says he was the victim of state violence after being arrested by the white-minority government in the former Rhodesia in 1965, when the ""crocodile gang"" he led helped blow up a train near Fort Victoria (now Masvingo). ""He was tortured, severely resulting in him losing his sense of hearing in one ear,"" the profile says. ""Part of the torture techniques involved being hanged with his feet on the ceiling and the head down. The severity of the torture made him unconscious for days."" As he said he was under 21 at the time, he was not executed but instead sentenced to 10 years in prison. ""He has scars from that period. He was young and brave,"" a close friend of Mr Mnangagwa once said, asking not to be named. ""Perhaps that explains why he is indifferent. Horrible things happened to him when he was young."" Have Zimbabwe's generals turned into democrats? The crusader taking on Zimbabwe's 'crocodile' Zimbabwe's exiled white farmers return Snapping at the heels of Zimbabwe's 'crocodile' The age factor His ruthlessness, which it could be argued he learnt from his Rhodesian torturers, is said to have been seen again in 2008 when he reportedly masterminded Zanu-PF's response to Mr Mugabe losing the first round of the president election to long-time rival Morgan Tsvangirai. The military and state security organisations unleashed a campaign of violence against opposition supporters, leaving hundreds dead and forcing thousands from their homes. Mr Tsvangirai then pulled out of the second round and Mr Mugabe was re-elected. Mr Mnangagwa has not commented on allegations he was involved in planning the violence, but an insider in the party's security department later confirmed that he was the political link between the army, intelligence and Zanu-PF. He was seen as Mr Mugabe's right-hand man - that is until the former first lady Grace Mugabe became politically ambitious and tried to edge him out. Their rivalry took a bizarre turn when he fell ill in August 2017 at a political rally led by former President Mugabe and had to be airlifted to South Africa. Grace Mugabe (right) bit off more than she could chew by taking on Mr Mnangagwa His supporters suggested that a rival group within Zanu-PF had poisoned him and appeared to blame ice cream from Mrs Mugabe's dairy firm. In his first words to cheering supporters after Mr Mugabe's resignation, he spoke about this plot and another plan to ""eliminate"" him. He has also blamed a group linked to the former first lady for an explosion in June at a Zanu-PF rally in Bulawayo in which two people died. But in a BBC interview, he said the country was safe, told foreign investors not to worry and sought to dispel his ruthless reputation: ""I am as soft as wool. I am a very soft person in life."" This video can not be played Mnangagwa: Criminal will be hounded down, but Zimbabwe is safe His youngest son, a Harare DJ known as St Emmo, blames his reticence for his fearsome reputation. ""He was a good father, very very strict. He doesn't say much and I think that's what frightens people - like: 'What is he thinking?'"" Nick Mangwana, Zanu-PF representative in the UK, accepts that the Zimbabwe's new leader is ""not the most eloquent"". ""He's not pally-pally but more of a do-er, more of a technocrat."" But in his six months in power he has fully embraced Twitter and Facebook - after the Bulawayo blast he posted a message reiterating the strength his Christian faith gives him.

"This video can not be played Ratko Mladic's trial in numbers Former Bosnian Serb commander Ratko Mladic has been jailed for life for genocide and other atrocities in the 1990s Bosnian war. Known as the ""Butcher of Bosnia"", Mladic led forces during the massacre of Bosnian Muslims (Bosniaks) in Srebrenica and the siege of Sarajevo. The UN tribunal in The Hague convicted him on 10 of the 11 charges. Mladic, 74, was not in court when the sentence was read out. He had been removed for shouting at the judges. ""It's a lie. Everything you said in this courtroom is a lie,"" he said. The outburst came after the judges rejected a request by his team to halt the proceedings because of Mladic's high blood pressure. Mladic has denied all the charges and his lawyer said he would appeal. Profile: The ""Butcher of Bosnia"" What is the case against Mladic? Mladic was the military commander of Bosnian Serb forces against Bosnian Croat and Bosniak armies. He had been on trial at the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) since 2012. It found that Mladic ""significantly contributed"" to the genocide in Srebrenica in 1995, where more than 7,000 Bosniak men and boys were murdered, the worst atrocity in Europe since World War Two. He was cleared of a second count of genocide in other municipalities. The other charges included war crimes and crimes against humanity. This video can not be played ""The soil here is soaked with blood"" - survivor Mevludin Oric Presiding judge Alphons Orie read out many crimes committed by troops under Mladic's command, including: Mass rapes of Bosniak  women and girls Keeping Bosniak prisoners in appalling conditions - starving, thirsty and sick - and beating them Terrorising civilians in Sarajevo by shelling and sniping at them Deporting Bosniaks forcibly en masse Destroying Bosniaks' homes and mosques At the end of the war in 1995 Mladic went into hiding and lived in obscurity in Serbia, protected by family and elements of the security forces. He was finally tracked down and arrested at a cousin's house in rural northern Serbia in 2011 after 16 years on the run. Mladic's days in the Scheveningen prison in The Hague have been taken up with playing chess, reading history books, watching TV and exercise. His usual chess rival is former Bosnian Serb President Radovan Karadzic, who was alsoconvicted of genocide and war crimes in the Bosnian warin 2016. Victims and their relatives watched the verdict in a memorial centre near Srebrenica, and erupted in cheers as it was read out. The group Mothers of Srebrenica said it was partially satisfied, and some relatives said Mladic deserved a harsher sentence. What now for Bosnia victims as Hague tribunal closes? Victims and their relatives watched the verdict in a memorial centre near Srebrenica The BBC's Anna Holligan in The Hague says victims filed out of the courtroom in victorious mood into the sunshine. Fikret Alic, the man whose skeletal image on the front cover of Time magazine shocked the world in 1992, smiled as he tucked into a cheese sandwich. He said he hoped Mladic's behaviour would mean the Serb general would go down in history as a coward who was not brave enough to face up to his own crimes. By Guy Delauney, BBC News, Sarajevo A relative mourns one of the Srebrenica massacre victims No cheers could be heard on the streets of the Bosnian capital ... ""The verdict won't make any changes,"" said Resad Trbonja, a native of Sarajevo who became a teenage soldier to defend the city during the siege, that left more than 10,000 people dead. ""What we need to fight now is the legacy of the war - we're still living it."" Read Guy's full report here. Chief prosecutor Serge Brammertz said the verdict was not a judgement on the Serbian people and that Mladic's guilt was his alone. UN human rights chief Zeid Ra'ad al-Hussein called Mladic the ""epitome of evil"" and said his prosecution was ""the epitome of what international justice is all about"". In early July 1995, Bosnian Serb forces besieged an area near the town of Srebrenica. It had been designated a United Nations ""safe zone"" and was being guarded by 600 lightly armed Dutch UN soldiers. The Serbs attacked from the south, prompting thousands of Bosniak civilians and fighters to flee north to Srebrenica. As the Serb advance continued, refugees fled north to the main Dutch base in Potocari. Gen Mladic summoned the Dutch commander, Col Thom Karremans, and demanded that the Bosniaks disarm to save their lives. LISTEN: Testifying against Mladic On 12 July, some 15,000 Bosniak men of military age broke out of the enclave. They were shelled as they fled through the mountains. Some were also killed after surrendering. Buses then deported an estimated 23,000 women and children to Bosniak territory, while the Serbs separated out all males from age 12 to 77. On 13 July the first killings of unarmed Bosniaks took place in the nearby village of Kravica. Over four days, up to 8,000 Bosniak men and boys were murdered by Bosnian Serbs at sites around Srebrenica. April 1992: Bosniaks take cover from shelling in Sarajevo Civilians in the Bosnian capital endured a brutal siege during 1992-1995 at the hands of Bosnian Serb forces, who fired down into the city from the surrounding hills. The death toll was more than 10,000. It was part of what prosecutors call a Serb ""criminal enterprise"" to spread terror among Bosniaks and Croats, and to drive them from areas claimed as Serb territory.

"This video can not be played Emmerson Mnangagwa addresses supporters in Harare Zimbabwe's incoming leader Emmerson Mnangagwa has hailed a ""new and unfolding democracy"" after returning from exile to replace Robert Mugabe. He also vowed to create jobs in a country where some estimates say 90% of people are unemployed. ""We want to grow our economy, we want peace, we want jobs, jobs, jobs,"" he told a cheering crowd in Harare. Mr Mnangagwa, who fled to South Africa two weeks ago, is to be made the new president on Friday, state TV said. His dismissal led the ruling party and the military to intervene and force an end to Mr Mugabe's 37-year long rule. Mugabe has gone, but will Zimbabwe change? Five things Zimbabwe's economy urgently needs Mugabe's downfall: The unanswered questions He told supporters at the headquarters of the ruling Zanu-PF party that he had been the subject of several assassination plots and thanked the army for running the ""process"" of removing Mr Mugabe peacefully. This video can not be played How news of Robert Mugabe's resignation was greeted across Zimbabwe The news that 93-year-old Mr Mugabe was stepping down sparked wild celebrations across the country late into Tuesday night. It came in the form of a letter read out in parliament on Tuesday, abruptly halting impeachment proceedings against him. In it, Mr Mugabe said he was resigning to allow a smooth and peaceful transfer of power, and that his decision was voluntary. Zanu-PF purges itself to win back Zimbabweans' trust Emmerson Mnangagwa: The 'crocodile' who snapped back A spokesman for the ruling Zanu-PF party said Mr Mnangagwa, 71, would serve the remainder of Mr Mugabe's term until elections that are due to be held by September 2018. Nicknamed the ""crocodile"" because of his political cunning, Mr Mnangagwa met South African President Jacob Zuma before leaving for Zimbabwe. BBC's Shingai Nyoka in Harare Thousands of party supporters waited for hours to welcome Mr Mnangagwa in his first public appearance since he emerged from hiding. During his 20-minute speech, he corrected himself at least once for referring to Mr Mugabe as president rather than former president. His message was largely conciliatory. But he also relished his stunning return to power and successful removal of Mr Mugabe. He brought up Grace Mugabe's speech a fortnight ago, in which - meaning him - she said we must ""deal with the snake by crushing its head"". A day later he was fired. ""I wonder which snake's head was crushed?"" he said to loud cheers. Mr Mnangagwa's firing by Mr Mugabe two weeks ago triggered an unprecedented political crisis in the country. It had been seen by many as an attempt to clear the way for Grace Mugabe to succeed her husband as leader and riled the military leadership, which stepped in and put Mr Mugabe under house arrest. Mugabe's long career in pictures The polarising Grace Mugabe Robert Mugabe: Hero or villain? Under the constitution, the role of successor would normally go to a serving vice-president, and one still remains in post - Phelekezela Mphoko. However, Mr Mphoko - a key ally of Mrs Mugabe - has just been fired by Zanu-PF and is not believed to be in the country. In his absence, the party has nominated Mr Mnangagwa, the speaker of parliament confirmed. Some have questioned whether the handover to Mr Mnangagwa will bring about real change in the country. He was national security chief at a time when thousands of civilians died in post-independence conflict in the 1980s, though he denies having blood on his hands. This video can not be played BBC correspondent Andrew Harding looks for Grace Mugabe in her heartland Opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai told the BBC he hoped that Zimbabwe was on a ""new trajectory"" that would include free and fair elections. He said Mr Mugabe should be allowed to ""go and rest for his last days"". Prominent opposition politician David Coltart tweeted: ""We have removed a tyrant but not yet a tyranny."" African Union president Alpha CondÃ© said he was ""truly delighted"" by the news, but expressed regret at the way Mr Mugabe's rule had ended. ""It is a shame that he is leaving through the back door and that he is forsaken by the parliament,"" he said. At 93, Mr Mugabe was - until his resignation - the world's oldest leader. He once proclaimed that ""only God"" could remove him. Lawmakers from the ruling party and opposition roared with glee when his resignation letter was read aloud in parliament on Wednesday.

"Ratko Mladic in Pale, Serbia, in May 1993 Ratko Mladic was the army general who became known as the ""Butcher of Bosnia"", who waged a brutal campaign during the Bosnian war and was jailed for life for directing his troops in the worst atrocities in post-war Europe. More than 20 years after he was first indicted by an international war crimes tribunal, and a year after the closing arguments in his case, Mladic appeared in court at The Hague on Wednesday to hear the verdict against him. In typical style, he railed against the judge and insulted the court and he was removed from the room. In his absence, he was convicted of genocide and crimes against humanity. Seemingly ever-present on the front lines and respected by his soldiers as a man of courage, Mladic oversaw an army of 180,000 men during the Bosnian war of the 1990s. In 1992, Bosnian Muslims (Bosniaks) and Croats voted for independence in a referendum boycotted by Serbs. The country descended into war, Bosniaks and Croats on one side and Bosnian Serbs on the other. Along with the Bosnian Serb political leader Radovan Karadzic, Mladic came to symbolise a Serb campaign of ethnic cleansing that left tens of thousands dead and hundreds of thousands displaced. The worst and most enduring crimes pinned on the former army chief and his men were an unrelenting three-year siege of Sarajevo that claimed more than 10,000 lives, and the massacre at Srebrenica, where more than 7,000 Bosniak men and boys were slaughtered and dumped in mass graves. This video can not be played ""The soil here is soaked with blood"" - survivor Mevludin Oric When the conflict came to an end in 1995, Mladic, facing an indictment for war crimes, went on the run. With considerable help, he evaded capture for 16 years, until May 2011 when police descended on an unassuming yellow brick house in the village of Lazarevo, north of Belgrade. Clad in black clothes and black masks, officers surrounded the house. Inside, Europe's most-wanted man - older in appearance than his 69 years and thinner than the bull-like general of his war days - was preparing to go for a walk in the garden. Mladic gets life for Bosnia genocide What now for Bosnia victims? Balkans war - a brief guide Srebrenica tries to move on Ratko Mladic was ferocious in pursuit of what he saw as the destiny of the Serb nation. He saw the war as an opportunity to avenge five centuries of occupation by Muslim Turks. He would refer to Bosniaks as ""Turks"" in order to insult them. There may have also been an emotional root to his ruthlessness. In 1995, a year before the massacre at Srebrenica, his much-loved daughter Ana, a medical student, shot herself with his pistol - an act that, according to people close to him, hardened his character. Some believe she chose to die after learning of atrocities committed by forces under her father's command. Mladic (centre) arrives at Sarajevo airport in 1993 Mladic was born in the south Bosnian village of Kalinovik. On his second birthday, in 1945, his father died fighting pro-Nazi Croatian Ustasha troops. He grew up in Tito's Yugoslavia and became a regular officer in the Yugoslav People's Army. A career soldier, he was said to inspire passionate devotion among his soldiers. When the country slid into war in 1991, Mladic was posted to lead the Yugoslav Army 9th Corps against Croatian forces at Knin. The following year he was appointed to lead a new Bosnian Serb army. As his gunners pounded the city of Sarajevo in early 1992, mercilessly killing civilians, he would yell ""Burn their brains!"" to encourage them, and ""Shell them until they're on the edge of madness!"" The siege laid waste to parts of central Sarajevo, hollowing out houses and charring cars. A long stretch of road leading into the city became known as ""sniper's alley"", after the Serb marksmen who would fire at anything that moved: car, man, woman or child. The most horrific crime of which Mladic was convicted happened 80km (50 miles) north of Sarajevo, in a small salt-mining town whose name would become indelibly associated with the horror of that week. Srebrenica was a Bosniak enclave under UN protection, when in July 1995 Mladic's forces overran it and rounded up thousands of men and boys aged between 12 and 77. As the men were detained, Mladic was seen handing out sweets to Bosniak children in the main square. Hours later, in a field outside the town, his men began shooting. Over the next five days, more than 7,000 men and boys were executed, reportedly machine-gunned in groups of 10 before being buried by bulldozer in mass graves. It was the worst mass execution since the crimes of the Nazis. A Bosnian Muslim woman mourns at the coffin of a relative killed at Srebrenica The war ended later that year. Hundreds of thousands of non-Serbs had been driven from their homes in an attempt to create an ethnically pure Serb state in Croatia and Bosnia. In late 1995, a UN war crimes tribunal indicted Mladic on two counts of genocide, for the Sarajevo siege and the Srebrenica massacre. Many other combatants, including Croats and Bosniaks, were also accused of war crimes. Mladic went on the run, but he didn't go far. As a fugitive Mladic still enjoyed the open support and protection of the then-Yugoslav President, Slobodan Milosevic. He returned to Belgrade, where he went untroubled to busy restaurants, football matches and horse races, escorted by bodyguards. But Milosevic's fall from power in 2000 and subsequent arrest put Mladic at risk. He spent the next decade moving through hideouts in Serbia, relying on a diminishing band of helpers. Ratko Mladic after his arrest in May 2011 In October 2004, his former aides began surrendering to the war crimes tribunal, as Serbia came under intense international pressure to co-operate. When Karadzic was detained in Belgrade in July 2008, speculation grew that Mladic's arrest would follow. But it was not until 26 May 2011 that police units descended on Lazarevo and surrounded Mladic's yellow brick house. When the officers moved in, the man who had vowed to never be taken alive surrendered quietly, and the two loaded guns he kept for protection lay untouched. He was 69 and had already suffered a stroke, partly paralysing his right arm. ""I could have killed 10 of you if I wanted, but I didn't want to,"" hereportedlytold the officers. ""You're just young men, doing your job."" He finally went on trial in 2012, at The Hague, facing 11 charges including genocide. The court, anxious that he should not die before the end of the proceedings, scaled back the case against him. He was in poor health, and had difficulty moving, apparently due to a series of strokes. ""I'm very old. Every day I'm more infirm and weaker,"" he told the court. Ratko Mladic was defiant at the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia in The Hague Despite his frailty, Mladic was defiant in court. He sarcastically applauded the judges as they entered, and argued vociferously with them. Catching the eye of a Bosnian woman who had gestured rudely to him, he drew his finger across his throat. His 12-member defence team argued that their client was an honest, professional career soldier who successfully defended Bosnian Serbs from the threat of genocide. They said he was in Belgrade for meetings with international officials when most of the killings in Srebrenica took place, and that he had no means of communication with the men there. The prosecution did not disagree, but contended that he met senior deputies before leaving the town, and gave them the order to kill. The defendant branded the court proceedings ""satanic"". Fanatical and fearless, Mladic became a folk hero to many of those he led, and he remains a hero to many in his home village of Bozanovici, where a sign nailed to tree still reads ""General Mladic Street"". Two decades on from the war, in a courtroom at the Hague, he was diminished physically but not in temper. Just as in his other court appearances, he shouted and disrupted the court. But it did not matter. He was removed, and his sentence handed down in his absence.

"A Srebrenica massacre victim's relative mourns in the cemetery Ratko Mladic terrorised the people of Sarajevo for almost four years, deliberately targeting civilians with snipers and mortar attacks. But no cheers could be heard on the streets of the Bosnian capital when news broke that the commander of Bosnian Serb forces in the 1990s had been sentenced to life imprisonment by the UN tribunal in The Hague. ""The verdict won't make any changes,"" said Resad Trbonja, a native of Sarajevo who became a teenage soldier to defend the city during the siege, that left more than 10,000 people dead. Now he works for the UK-based campaign organisation Remember Srebrenica. ""What we need to fight now is the legacy of the war - we're still living it.

""The only people who gain from the situation we are stuck in are the local politicians - they keep the legacy of war alive to maintain their power."" Mladic gets life for Bosnia genocide Profile: The ""Butcher of Bosnia"" What is the case against Mladic? July 1992: Bosniak soldiers were outgunned by Serb forces in Sarajevo At least Hasan Nuhanovic could take comfort that Mladic was found guilty of ordering genocide in his hometown, Srebrenica. Mr Nuhanovic lost his father, mother and younger brother in the massacre - and designed the memorial centre opposite the cemetery, where thousands of victims are buried. More than 7,000 Bosniak (Bosnian Muslim) men and boys were murdered at sites around Srebrenica in 1995. While he welcomed the verdict, Mr Nuhanovic doubted it would reduce the enduring ethnic divisions which have crippled Bosnia since the end of the war. ""The question is: when will this politically-hostile environment change?

"Growth forecasts for the UK economy have been cut sharply following changes to estimates of productivity and business investment. The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) now expects the economy to grow by 1.5% this year, down from the estimate of 2% it made in March. Growth, it says, will drop to 1.3% by 2020 and then rise to 1.5% in 2021. The lower growth means that by 2021-22 government tax receipts will be Â£20bn lower than the OBR's March forecast. The OBR expects borrowing as a share of economic output will still fall, but not as fast as it predicted in March. It forecasts that borrowing this year will be 2.4% of Gross Domestic Product (GDP), rather than its previous prediction of 2.9%. By 2021-22, it says that percentage will be down to 1.3%. However, in March, it had expected borrowing to have fallen to 0.7% of GDP by then. Live: Budget reaction and analysis At a glance summary: Budget key points What the Budget means for you The figures make it harder for the Chancellor, Philip Hammond, to hit his target of bringing borrowing down to less than 2% of GDP by 2020-21. In March, the OBR estimated borrowing would then be at 0.9% of GDP. Today's forecast is for it to be at 1.5%. In his Budget speech, Mr Hammond said: ""Regrettably our productivity performance continues to disappoint. Today the OBR revised down the outlook for productivity growth, business investment and GDP growth."" Yael Selfin, chief economist at KPMG UK, said: ""The downgrade to UK GDP growth forecasts has totally overshadowed the generally good news on public finances so far this fiscal year, reducing the money available to the chancellor. ""However, the chancellor is sticking to his target of reducing public borrowing to less than 2% of national income by 2020-21, albeit with a reduced chest for any emergency spending in the event the economy requires an additional boost."" John Hawksworth, chief economist at PwC, said: ""The headroom he used to have between his target and the forecast represented about Â£20-26bn. That's now been reduced to about Â£15bn because of less growth and more borrowing. ""He is trying to walk a tightrope of fiscal prudence and austerity."" The OBR says in itsEconomic and Fiscal Outlook report,externalthat the impact of lower productivity means that GDP will grow by 5.7% over the next five years rather than by the 7.5% as it estimated in March. It added: ""We expect real GDP growth to slow from 1.5% this year to 1.4% in 2018 and 1.3% in 2019, as public spending cuts intensify and Brexit-related uncertainty continues to bear down on activity."" However, it said that the revisions to productivity had nothing to do with Brexit, or with the latest economic figures, but simply because of what it called a ""repeated tendency throughout the post-crisis period for productivity growth to disappoint"". Ian Stewart, chief economist at Deloitte, said: ""The OBR's view that weak productivity is here to stay, and is not just a lingering hangover from the financial crisis, means a longer haul to eliminate the deficit and slower wage growth."" The OBR has also cut its estimates for business investment. Its report said: ""We now expect business investment to rise by around 12% between the first quarter of 2017 and the first quarter of 2022, significantly lower than the 19% expected in March. ""This downward revision reflects the weaker outlook for productivity growth lowering the expected return on capital."" On unemployment, the OBR said it believed the rate was now as low as it is going to go. ""We expect the rate to trough at 4.3% of the labour force - its current rate - in the second half of this year, and then to edge up as GDP growth slows a little further and the National Living Wage prices some workers out of employment.""

"The sale of new diesel cars that do not meet latest emissions standards will face a one-off tax increase in April. It will be levied on all diesels that do not meet the Real Driving Emissions Step 2 standards on emissions for the first year of ownership. According to experts, it means that most new diesels would be subject to the rise. Chancellor Philip Hammond said the tax change would apply only to cars, and ""white van man"" was unaffected. Different rates of Vehicle Excise Duty will be levied according to a car's CO2 emissions band. A Ford Fiesta or Vauxhall Astra would see a one-off Â£20 rise and a Land Rover Discovery a Â£400 increase. Cars in the top band, such as a Porsche Cayenne, would be hit with a Â£500 tax. The chancellor said: ""Drivers buying a new car will be able to avoid this charge as soon as manufacturers bring forward the next-generation cleaner diesels that we all want to see. Live: Budget reaction and analysis At a glance summary: Budget key points What the Budget means for you The move was part of a series of Budget policies designed to improve air quality and promote electric vehicles. The chancellor also unveiled a Â£220m Clean Air Fund, and Â£400m - split equally between the Treasury and motor industry - to improve the charging infrastructure for electric vehicles. There will also be another Â£100m in subsidies to help persuade consumers to buy electric vehicles. The key thing... if you've already got a diesel car, you won't pay more. That's hardly a surprise, bearing in mind people were encouraged to buy diesels some years ago. The government wasn't about to slap a big tax on drivers who parted with lots of money in good faith. From April though, if you are buying a new diesel, you will probably pay more tax in the first year. It depends on the emissions test that it had to pass, so I'd ask the dealer before you buy. The new tax rise will apply until around 2021, by which time all new cars have to meet the tighter pollution rules. And this only applies to cars, not vans, trucks, etc. So, it's more of a soft, brushing nudge rather than a big push to persuade people away from polluting diesels. Of course, there is a danger that it convinces drivers to keep their old, dirtier diesels, rather than buy a new, cleaner one. The UK's motor industry trade body, the SMMT, said the chancellor's diesel tax changes risked sending out mixed messages. Chief executive Mike Hawes said: ""Diesel buyers will not face any additional taxation for the next six months, but thereafter, will face additional charges which will undermine fleet renewal efforts, which are the best and quickest way to address air quality concerns. ""Manufacturers are investing heavily in the latest low emission technology. However, it's unrealistic to think that we can fast-track the introduction of the next generation of clean diesel technology which takes years to develop."" But Peter Williams, of the motoring group RAC, said: ""The chancellor has chosen to be relatively light touch when it comes to taxing new diesel cars. ""Any new diesel car registered from 1st April 2018 will be hit with a higher first year tax rate unless they conform to the latest real world driving standards. ""So current beleaguered owners of diesel cars can breathe a sigh of relief that they will not be punished further by the Treasury - but they will need to keep their eyes on local authorities who may be introducing clean air zones in the near future."" However, he added that a side effect of the Budget announcement might be a risk that drivers will be encouraged to keep their older diesel vehicles.

"This video can not be played NHS services in England will get an extra Â£2.8bn, the chancellor says in his Budget speech The extra money announced by the chancellor in the Budget for the NHS in England is not enough, health service bosses say. Philip Hammond announced an immediate Â£350m boost for this winter followed by Â£1.6bn more next year for the front line above the rise already planned. The chancellor described it as an ""exceptional"" measure, which recognised the pressures the service was under. But NHS leaders have already warned waiting times will continue to worsen.  Can't find your health trust?Browse the full list Rather search by typing?Back to search If you can't see the NHS Tracker,click or tap here,external. The Budget announcement comes after independent experts had called for Â£4bn extra next year and NHS England boss Simon Stevens had warned ministers the public expected increased investment following claims made during the EU referendum that the NHS would benefit financially from Brexit. Mr Stevens said without action waiting times for key services would continue to worsen. Responding to the Budget, NHS England chairman Sir Malcolm Grant said the extra money would go only ""some way towards filling the accepted funding cap"". And he said the country could ""no longer avoid the difficult debate"" about what the health service could deliver for patients. Chris Hopson, chief executive of NHS Providers, which represents health service managers, said ""tough choices and trade offs"" would now need to be made. ""It is difficult to see how the NHS can deliver everything,"" he added. In total, Mr Hammond announced an extra Â£2.8bn of funding over the next three years. Â£350m this year Â£1.6bn in 2018-19 Â£850m in 2019-20 That is on top of the rises already set out by the government's spending plans made in 2015, which would have seen the front-line budget rise by Â£9bn in cash terms to nearly Â£116bn. Mr Hammond described the NHS as one of the country's ""greatest institutions"", but said he recognised it was ""under pressure"". He said that was why he was taking the exceptional step of announcing extra funding outside of the formal spending review process. ""We will always back it,"" he told MPs. He also said any pay rises for NHS staff next year - the 1% cap is being lifted - would not need to come from the front-line budget. ""Nurses deserve our deepest gratitude."" Some will say the reaction of those in the health sector is to be expected - they are never satisfied they have enough money. But a look back at the funding history of the NHS shows they have a point. Traditionally the health budget has got an extra 4% a year above inflation to help it cope with the ageing population and cost of new drugs and treatments. Since 2010 that figure has dropped to close to 1% - and this extra money does little to improve that. Those working in accident and emergency units point out that the Â£350m for this winter could easily be swallowed up by spending on agency staff. It is why staff on the front line are still predicting rising waiting times for treatment.

"This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn: ""So much for tackling injustices"" Chancellor Philip Hammond's Budget will ""unravel"" within days, continuing the ""misery"" for people across the country, Jeremy Corbyn has predicted. The Labour leader attacked the government's failure to reduce the deficit, a rise in rough sleeping and the fact 120,000 people will spend Christmas in temporary accommodation. ""It's a record of failure with a forecast of more to come,"" he said. Mr Hammond ended stamp duty for first-time buyers on sales up to Â£300,000. Stamp duty cut for first time buyers Key points at-a-glance No political drama from 'Box Office Phil' In his second Budget, the chancellor also announced measures to speed up the payment of universal credit benefits and a rise in the National Living Wage to Â£7.83 an hour. But, responding in the Commons, the Labour leader said: ""The reality test of this Budget has to be how it affects ordinary people's lives. ""I believe as the days go ahead and this Budget unravels, the reality will be a lot of people will be no better off - and the misery many are in will be continuing."" Mr Corbyn claimed a plan for three new pilot schemes to help rough sleepers ""doesn't cut it"", stressing: ""It is a disaster for those people sleeping on our streets, forced to beg for the money for a night shelter. ""They're looking for action now from government to give them a roof over their heads."" He said one in six pensioners were living in poverty - ""the worst rate anywhere in western Europe"" - adding that the poorest tenth of households would lose 10% of their income by 2022, while the richest would lose just 1%. And he responded angrily to an MP who heckled him as he was noting that more than a million elderly people were not receiving the care they need. ""I hope you understand what it's like to wait for social care, stuck in a hospital bed, while other people have to give up their work to care for them,"" he said, adding: ""The uncaring, uncouth attitude of certain members opposite needs to be called out."" The Labour leader called for universal credit to be put ""on hold"" so it can be fixed to ""keep one million of our children out of poverty"". He also questioned why the chancellor thought it was ""OK to under pay, over stress and under appreciate all those that work within our NHS"". ""We were promised with lots of hype a revolutionary Budget - the reality is, nothing has changed,"" he said. ""People were looking for help from this Budget and they have been let down by a government that, like the economy they have presided over, is weak and unstable and in need of urgent change.

"There will be extra funding to encourage more pupils to study maths A-level Head teachers' leaders are ""extremely disappointed"" by what they say is theBudget'sfailure to address ""urgent"" school funding shortages in England. Geoff Barton, leader of the ASCL heads' union, said extra cash for maths was a ""drop in the ocean"" and schools would still face real-terms cuts. Maths A-level will be encouraged, with Â£600 for schools for each pupil taking the subject above current numbers. The Chancellor said maths skills were needed for ""cutting edge"" jobs. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn criticised the lack of movement on student debt and warned that schools in England would be ""5% worse off by 2019"". In his Budget speech, Philip Hammond announced a Â£117m boost for maths, alongside plans to train 12,000 computer teachers and more support for adult re-training. But school leaders were angered that there was no extra cash for core school spending. It would now be ""impossible for many schools to avoid making redundancies"", said Paul Whiteman, leader of the National Association of Head Teachers. Budget 2017: Key points at-a-glance Budget Live: Rolling text and video updates Budget 2017: Everything you need to know West Sussex head teacher and funding campaigner, Jules White, said that representatives of 5,000 schools had visited Downing Street last week - calling for the return of Â£1.7bn which they say had been ""taken from school budgets"". But Mr White said ""our reasonable request fell on deaf ears"". The lack of movement on school funding would leave ""parents and teachers deeply disappointed,"" said the National Education Union. Jo Yurky, a parent campaigner over school funding, said the spending plans were ""out of touch with the concerns of parents"" and that the maths announcement was ""tinkering around the edges with gimmicky ideas"". But supporting an increased uptake of maths was welcomed by Professor Frank Kelly, chair of the Royal Society's advisory committee on mathematics education. ""Mathematics is essential for understanding the modern world and provides the foundations for economic prosperity,"" said Prof Kelly. The Chancellor's Budget statement announced financial incentives to boost maths after the age of 16, after concerns that too many drop the subject after GCSEs. ""Knowledge of maths is key to the hi-tech, cutting-edge jobs in our digital economy,"" said Mr Hammond. The Chancellor said he wanted ""highly talented young mathematicians"" to be able to ""release their potential wherever they live and whatever their background"". From 2019, schools will receive an extra Â£600 for every additional student taking maths or further maths A-level or core maths above current levels. University lecturers said that student finance was a ""glaring omission"" from the Budget But heads' leader, Geoff Barton, warned that the funding offer for maths could create a ""perverse incentive to enter students on to maths courses which might not necessarily be the best option for them"". He also raised concerns that it would be ""unfair"" that schools that had already increased their number of maths A-levels students would miss out on extra funding. Mr Hammond also invited proposals for new maths specialist schools. There will be Â£42m over three years to provide extra training to ""improve the quality of teaching"" in a pilot project in some under-performing schools in England. In the selected schools, each teacher will have access to Â£1,000 worth of training. Schools have struggled to recruit computer science teachers - and there will Â£84m over four years to train 12,000 more staff qualified to teach the subject, with the support of a new National Centre for Computing. This was welcomed by Cindy Rose, the UK chief executive of Microsoft, who said: ""There is an urgent need for the UK to tackle its digital skills gap."" The Chancellor announced a national re-training scheme for adults, in partnership with the CBI and the TUC, with an initial Â£30m to teach digital skills. Further education colleges were promised Â£20m to prepare for the so-called ""T-level"" qualifications, which will be for vocational subjects. Angela Rayner, Labour's shadow education secretary, said: ""The schemes announced today are a tiny fraction of the money he has cut from school budgets since 2015 and despite his spin, schools will be worse off by 2020."" Kevin Courtney, joint leader of the National Education Union, said: ""The Budget, with no significant new money for education, shows that the Government has chosen to ignore the anger of parents and the clear evidence of the problems being created by real terms cuts to education."" The UCU lecturers' union said the ""glaring omission"" from the Chancellor's speech was any reference to the promised review of university funding or support for students.

"The coach quickly became a ""complete inferno"", the inquest heard A bus driver died when he deliberately crashed to save his passengers from plummeting off a road in the French Alps, an inquest has heard. Maurice Wrightson drove into boulders on the narrow mountain road when he realised his brakes had failed. Mr Wrightson, 63, from Ashington, diedin the April 2013 crashand four of the 50 passengers were seriously injured. French investigators said the driver ""undoubtedly prevented"" a more serious crash, Berwick Coroner's Court heard. The coach, which was carrying British staff from the French ski resort Alpe d'Huez, was approaching the 21st hairpin bend on the D211 road. Nathan Woodland, 39, the co-driver of the coach operated by County Durham-based Classic Coaches, told the inquest he felt the bus twitch and quickly became aware something was wrong. He said: ""Suddenly Maurice looked at me with a very shocked look on his face. ""He said 'it's not stopping us'."" He said Mr Wrightson gripped the wheel very tightly and braced himself against his seat to apply more pressure to the brake. Mr Woodland said: ""I stepped into the aisle and shouted, 'grab a hold, hold tight'."" He then described how the coach smashed into the boulders and he was thrown a number of rows back. As he picked himself up he saw people desperately trying to escape and flames begin to engulf the coach, which quickly turned into a ""complete inferno"". He said the clothing of one woman, who was sitting behind the driver, caught fire as she was pulled from the bus by another passenger. Speaking at the time, French transport minister Frederic Cuvillier said Mr Wrightson ""showed remarkable courage"" and avoided a ""much heavier loss of life"". The inquest jury heard the French report concluded the brake failed as the pad had been ""completely destroyed by excessive heating"" due to the ""poor condition of the hydraulic retarder"".

"Much of the rest of the world is growing at a healthier clip. For Britain it is a different story. Today theOffice for Budget Responsibility,external(OBR) downgraded growth forecasts for the next four years. And it has been more aggressive with those downgrades than the Bank of England was in its Inflation Report earlier in the month. The productivity problem is at the heart of that judgement. The UK just hasn't been very good at producing wealth for every hour worked, and today the OBR lowered its expectations about how fast productivity will recover. Which means that tax receipts will suffer, by up to Â£20bn a year by 2023. Add to that the increase in inflation following the Brexit referendum and the squeeze in real incomes and the OBR is clear - the economy is not as strong as it thought it would be. UK growth forecast cut sharply Live: Budget reaction and analysis What the Budget means for you At a glance summary: Budget key points The chancellor's response has been two-fold. First, he has tried to paint a positive vision of Britain's future He has talked of the good record on employment. And, in the short term, the news on borrowing is better as tax revenues have been higher and public spending lower. Second, he has significantly loosened the fiscal tight belt he had thrown around the economy. In March, Mr Hammond planned for two years of higher spending - giveaways - followed by three years of tax rises - takeaways. Now he has said that borrowing will be higher for every year of the five-year forecast, and higher spending will last until 2023. Many economists will welcome such a move, the government doing more to stimulate the economy. When the Bank of England raises rates, it increases the cost of the government's bills The chancellor has pledged more money for health, a stamp duty tax cut and Â£3bn to prepare for leaving the European Union. But debt will continue to rise, and that means the cost of servicing the amount the government borrows will increase. Much of the government's debt is index linked - so its cost rises if inflation goes up. And every time the Bank of England increases interest rates, that also increases the cost of repaying the government's bills. The worry in the Treasury is that they have used up a good deal of the public finances headroom Mr Hammond wanted to build up for the future in case Brexit uncertainty around the economy crystalizes into another growth downgrade. The question now is what will happen if he needs to find more funding and still hit his target to balance the government's books by the middle of the next decade. And of course very little inthis Budgetwill affect the key economic headwind everyone is facing. And that is the fall in real incomes.

"It wasn't a drama - it wasn't a Budget that would inspire queues at the Box Office. No surprise. When ""Box Office Phil"" was given that nickname, it wasn't because he has a reputation for delivering political thrillers. What he tried to do was to act on concerns expressed at the general election and by rebels on the Tory backbenches as well as the Labour opposition. So there were changes to the universal credit benefit, some, but certainly not all the money the NHS says it needs - and an enormous sounding figure of Â£44bn for housing over the next five years (although vital to wait for the detail of how much will go to getting spades in the ground, and how much will guarantee loans for the housing industry). Stamp duty cut for first time buyers Budget key points at-a-glance But he made a bigger-than-expected move to ""revive the home-owning dream"" by scrapping stamp duty on the first Â£300,000 of any property bought by a first-time buyer. The prime minister has set her own personal reputation on fixing the housing crisis, so there is a lot riding on the mixture of moves that has been promised by Philip Hammond today. He also responded to pressure from Brexit-backing colleagues in cabinet, by putting aside an extra Â£3bn to plan for a ""no deal"" scenario. What the chancellor also tried to do was to claim that somehow a corner has been turned in the long-term battle to sort out the country's books, with debt peaking and starting to fall as a share of national income. But it will be tricky for the government to escape the overall picture: that the economy looks like it will be more sluggish, will grow more slowly and will be less productive than expected for some time to come.

"A Budget has been delivered by Chancellor Philip Hammond which he says will ""help families to cope with the cost of living"". The chancellor has announced plans on tax, housing and travel, alongside an update on the UK's economic position. Here is what it means for you. The stand out feature ofthe Budgetfor first-time buyers living in England, Northern Ireland and, for a time, in Wales is an immediate abolition of stamp duty when buying properties of up to Â£300,000. For properties costing up to Â£500,000, no stamp duty will be paid on the first Â£300,000. The starting point for paying stamp duty in England was Â£125,000. According to the Halifax, the average first-time buyer in the UK had paid about Â£1,660 in stamp duty, on a property costing Â£211,980. However, in many parts of the country first-time buyers pay relatively little in stamp duty. In the North of England, the typical first-time buyer saving would be Â£24, the lender said. The effect will be felt the most in the South East of England where the average home bought by a first-time buyer could save Â£3,948, and in London with a saving of Â£5,000. The Office For Budget Responsibility also pointed out that a subsequent rise in house prices would more than cancel out the benefit from the stamp duty measures, and it will primarily assist existing homeowners, with only an additional 3,500 first-time buyer sales at a significant cost to the Treasury. It does not affect the biggest up-front cost for first-time buyers - the deposit. In the UK, the average deposit is Â£37,101, according to the Halifax. If a couple are buying and only one is a first-time buyer, then they do not get the tax break. It also will do nothing for those trading up, whose numbers have fallen sharply in the last 10 years, or potential downsizers who are put off by the stamp duty cost. Housing is a devolved issue, so there are different rules in the different nations. In Scotland, the equivalent tax is called Land and Buildings Transaction Tax. Here the tax is levied on buyers purchasing homes costing more than Â£145,000 - the same as the average house price for all buyers. New rates havealready been set in Wales for next April, with a starting point tax of 2.5% on properties of more than Â£150,000. The average home in Wales cost Â£153,000 in September, official figures show. The changes announced in the Budget will take effect until then. Scotland and Wales will need to decide whether they follow this measure in England. Northern Ireland, which has the same stamp duty rates as England, has an average house price of Â£132,000. Mr Hammond announced measures that he said would see 300,000 new homes built a year by the mid-2020s. He had signalled this change earlier in the week. Local authorities will be able to increase the council tax premium on empty homes from 50% to 100% ""to encourage owners of empty homes to bring their properties back into use"". Budget calculator At a glance summary: Budget key points Live: Budget reaction and analysis Stamp duty changes explained At present 31 million people pay income tax in the UK. Nearly 26 million of those pay at the basic rate. The amount earned before income tax is paid - called the personal allowance - will rise from Â£11,500 to Â£11,850 in April. This will cut less than Â£100 a year off a basic rate taxpayer's annual bill. It was a Conservative manifesto pledge to increase the personal allowance to Â£12,500 by 2020-21. The higher rate is paid by 5.2 million people. The threshold will rise from Â£45,000 to Â£46,350. The government has already pledged to increase this to Â£50,000 by 2020-21. The threshold is different in Scotland (owing to devolved powers) where it is Â£43,000. The Scottish government will announce its intentions for these rates in December. Universal credit is a new benefit for working-age people, replacing six benefits and merging them into one payment. They are Income Support, income-based Jobseeker's Allowance, income-related employment and support allowance, Housing Benefit, Child Tax Credit and Working Tax Credit. Currently people typically have to wait six weeks for their first payment and one in five wait longer. The chancellor announced various measures to tackle some of the issues raised in a concerted campaign from charities and many MPs. This is likely to cut a week off this wait. New Universal Credit claimants in receipt of Housing Benefit will now continue to receive it for two weeks. The duty on beer, cider and spirits has been frozen this time, although there will be an increase on some high-strength drinks, including some white ciders. There was a 2p increase on a pint of beer and 1p increase in cider announced in the Spring Budget. A bottle of Scotch whisky was increased by 36p in March. The chancellor has now announced an additional duty on hand-rolling tobacco, on top of the previously announced inflation plus 2% rise in tobacco duty which would push up the cost of a packet of 20 cigarettes by 28p. Fuel duty has been frozen again, a move that will be welcomed by many drivers. Many drivers of new diesel cars will see an increase in the road tax they pay in the first year of owning their car from April. They will be levied on one band higher than those with petrol cars, owing to the environmental effect of this type of fuel. This will amount to only about Â£20 for smaller cars, and Â£300 for larger cars, Treasury figures show. At present, there is a sliding scale of charges for the first year of ownership and after that petrol or diesel vehicles are subject to a ""standard"" rate of Â£140 a year. Only those diesel vehicles that do not meet the very latest European emissions standards will be affected. The existing diesel supplement in company car tax is also going up, and there will be less of a tax impact for those who charge up their electric car at work, The government has said people up to 30 years-old will be able to buy a Â£30 railcard for discounted train travel from next spring - an extension of the current young person's railcard for those aged 16 to 25. The so called millennials' card will be available from spring next year, and offer up to a third off non-peak fares, which usually apply on services after 10am. The 3% rise in the state pension in April has been confirmed, amounting to Â£3.65 extra a week. As is usually the case, this is in line with inflation, which measures the cost of living, in September. Changes already earmarked for next April and subsequent financial years include: Many working-age benefits will be halfway through a four-year freeze by April. These include Jobseeker's Allowance, Employment and Support Allowance, some types of Housing Benefit, and Child Benefit. However, state pensions, Maternity Pay and some disability benefits are excluded. This is on course to save the Treasury Â£4.6bn, according to the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) The gradual process allowing people to pass on property to their descendantsfree from some inheritance taxwill enter its second year. It will reach its target by 2021 Many buy-to-let landlords are seeing the amount oftax relief that they can claim on mortgage interest paymentscut over the course of four years. The process began in April. Eventually, they will only be able to claim at the lower rate of tax, not the higher Director shareholders will see a tax break reduced on the dividends they receive. The tax-free dividend allowance - which came into force in 2016 - will be reduced from Â£5,000 to Â£2,000 from April. That will affect those who own a small business and pay themselves in dividends alongside a small salary and people with large portfolios of shares, perhaps by hundreds of pounds Public sector pay in England and Wales was frozen for two years in 2010, except for those earning less than Â£21,000 a year, and since 2013, rises have been capped at 1% At-a-glance summary: Budget key points Budget 2017: Your questions answered Richer or poorer?

"Ratko Mladic (C) commanded Bosnian Serb forces during a very bloody campaign Ratko Mladic has been found guilty over some of the worst crimes of the wars in former Yugoslavia, including genocide. The UN war crimes tribunal in The Hague sentenced him to life imprisonment. He was the military commander of Bosnian Serb forces in the 1990s, against Bosnian Croat and Bosniak (Bosnian Muslim) armies. The Bosnian Serbs' political leader, Radovan Karadzic, was found guilty of war crimes in March 2016 and sentenced to 40 years in jail. Themost notorious crimes in the Mladic indictment,externalare the massacre of more than 7,000 Bosniak men and boys at Srebrenica in 1995 and the siege of Sarajevo in which more than 10,000 people died. Srebrenica was the worst massacre in Europe since World War Two. Now 75, he went on trial in 2012. At the end of the war in 1995 he went into hiding and lived in obscurity in Serbia, protected by family and elements of the security forces. He was indicted for genocide and crimes against humanity but evaded justice for 16 years. He was finally tracked down and arrested at a cousin's house in rural northern Serbia in 2011. In early July 1995, Bosnian Serb forces besieged an area near the town of Srebrenica. It had been designated a United Nations ""safe zone"" and was being guarded by 600 lightly-armed Dutch UN soldiers. The Serbs attacked from the south, prompting thousands of Bosniak civilians and fighters to flee north to Srebrenica. By 10 July some 4,000 had gathered there. The Serb advance continued, and a bigger surge of refugees fled north to the main Dutch base in Potocari. Gen Mladic summoned the Dutch commander, Col Thom Karremans, and demanded that the Bosniaks disarm to save their lives. On 12 July, some 15,000 Bosniak men of military age broke out of the enclave. They were shelled as they fled through the mountains. Some were also killed after surrendering. Buses then deported an estimated 23,000 women and children to Bosniak territory, while the Serbs separated out all males from age 12 to 77 for ""interrogation for suspected war crimes"". Hundreds of men were held in trucks and warehouses. On 13 July 1995 the first killings of unarmed Bosniaks took place in a warehouse in the nearby village of Kravica. The Dutch peacekeepers handed over about 5,000 who had been sheltering at their base. In return, the Bosnian Serbs released 14 Dutch peacekeepers who had been held hostage at Nova Kasaba, a Serb base. Over four days, up to 8,000 Bosniak men and boys were murdered by Bosnian Serbs at sites around Srebrenica. Dutch partly responsible for Bosnia deaths Can Serb mayor ease Bosnia's Srebrenica pain? April 1992: Bosniaks take cover from shelling in Sarajevo Civilians in the Bosnian capital endured a brutal siege in 1992-1995 at the hands of Bosnian Serb forces, who fired down into the city from the surrounding hills. The death toll was more than 10,000. It was part of what prosecutors call a Serb ""criminal enterprise"" to spread terror among Bosniaks and Croats, and to drive them from areas claimed as Serb territory.

"People claiming the benefit universal credit will have to wait five weeks, rather than six, to receive their first payment from February 2018. The government had been coming under mounting pressure to act after reports that many people were getting into rent arrears, problem debt or having to use food banks while waiting to receive the benefit. In hisBudgetthe chancellor also announced that housing benefit claimants could continue to receive it for an extra two weeks while waiting for their universal credit payments to start. And advances available to people who need it will be made more generous, covering up to the full value of their claim, rather than a maximum of half. BBC Reality Check wanted to know, how significant is this announcement, in particular the reduction of the six-week wait to five? People claiming universal credit will now wait, to be precise, 35 days rather than 42 before they get their first payment. It's helpful to think of the current waiting period before people can receive their first universal credit in three chunks: Four weeks to assess how much someone has earned in the last month An administrative week set aside to process the payment A further seven ""waiting days"" during which claimants are not eligible for any benefit - this is what the chancellor is scrapping The four weeks is more or less baked into the design of the system. Universal credit was designed to be paid in arrears once a person's monthly income has been assessed. Changing this feature would have required a fairly significant change to the whole structure of the benefit. So it was in the other 14 days that the government had some leeway. The reduction in the waiting period announced in the Budget strips away seven of those extra days, leaving a full week to process the payment. Arguably, the chancellor could have shortened the payment processing time too. Live: Budget reaction and analysis What the Budget means for you At-a-glance summary of the Budget key points It was the seven additional ""waiting days"" many took issue with, since it's difficult to see what purpose those days served other than to save money. David Finch, a senior policy analyst at think tank the Resolution Foundation, described them as a ""completely unnecessary saving"" which had a disproportionate negative impact on claimants. And areport on the six week waiting period,externalby a cross-party group of MPs, chaired by Labour MP Frank Field, described the motivation of those extra days as ""primarily fiscal"". But the motivation behind universal credit was not a cost-saving one - it was supposed to be all about getting more people into work. The report's authors added that they had been told by a wide range of charities, councils and housing associations that the seven waiting days did ""nothing to further the stated objectives of Universal Credit but contribute to claimant hardship."" Just overa third of people eligible for universal credit have always been exempt,externalfrom having to go for seven ""waiting days"" with no benefits. This group includes people who are moving on to universal credit from a relevant existing benefit, those who have claimed Jobseeker's Allowance or Employment Support Allowance in the past three months, young people under the age of 22 leaving local authority care and victims of domestic abuse. The other 64% of new claimants will benefit from this change. The actual number of people will vary - there were 47,000 newpeople starting to receive universal credit,externalin the most recent month we have data for (13 September to 12 October). The new benefit is being introduced in stages Chancellor Philip Hammond said the whole package of reform announced today would cost Â£1.5bn over five years. When it introduced the seven day wait period the government saidthe policy would save Â£150m,externalper year, after universal credit had been rolled out, so it's reasonable to think this is what it would cost them in the future. For the average person claiming the benefit, they'll have Â£73 extra in their pockets plus housing costs and any other elements they qualify for - like childcare support. The Resolution Foundation adds that while this change is important, the waiting time is not the biggest underlying problem with universal credit. So what else could the chancellor have done to reform the benefit? He could have reversed cuts made in 2015 to the ""work allowance"". People with children, or who have a disability which restricts the amount they can work, are currently able to earn up to Â£397 a month before they start losing any benefits. But before April 2016, all claimants could earn a certain amount before their benefits began to be withdrawn and some people could earn up to Â£734 without losing a penny. At the moment this work allowance is assessed by household. Having a work allowance for individuals could strengthen the incentive for the second earner in a family to work. Last Autumn, the chancellor announced a reduction to the taper rate. That's the amount of benefit you lose for every extra pound you earn.  Previously, claimants lost 65p of benefit for every extra pound they earned, and this was reduced to 63p last year. So the chancellor could have opted to reduce this further. And there are other smaller concessions government could make, for example paying eligible claimants their childcare costs upfront rather than making them pay and claim the costs back.

"Stamp duty will be abolished immediately for first-time buyers buying a home of up to Â£300,000, Chancellor Philip Hammond has said. For properties costing up to Â£500,000, no stamp duty will be paid on the first Â£300,000. Mr Hammond said this meant 95% of first-time buyers would see stamp duty cut, while 80% would pay none at all. The change will apply in England and Northern Ireland, and in Wales up until the end of March, but not in Scotland. Scotland has an independent system of land tax. Stamp duty will be devolved to Wales from March 2018. In the rest of the UK stamp duty is paid on all residential properties worth more than Â£125,000. The duty is levied at a staggered rate above that threshold, starting at 2% but increasing in line with the value of the property being bought. The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) said the main beneficiaries would be existing homeowners, rather than first-time buyers, because it expects all house prices to rise by 0.3% within a year as a result of the change. It also estimates that it will result in only an additional 3,500 first-time buyer purchases. However, the chancellor insisted that young people will benefit. ""This is our plan to deliver on the pledge we have made to the next generation that the dream of home ownership will become a reality in this country once again,"" Mr Hammond said. Live: Budget reaction and analysis What the Budget means for you At a glance summary: Budget key points The policy will cost the Treasury Â£3.2bn over the next five years. Andrew Norfolk, who is saving to buy a property in Cambridge, said the Stamp Duty change was a start, but more could be done. ""As a 26-year-old, working in a well-paid professional job, I find it ridiculous how difficult it is to get on the ladder without help from mum and dad. ""If I'm struggling - and I consider my position more fortunate than most - how on earth do most people ever stand a chance at home ownership?"" Estate agent Savills estimates that the average stamp duty bill for first-time buyers is about Â£2,700. But in many parts of the country, first-time buyers will see no - or very little - saving at all. In the North of England, the average Stamp Duty charge is just Â£11.82, according to analysts at AJ Bell. This is because average house prices in the region are only just above the English Stamp Duty threshold, at Â£125,000. However, buyers who spend Â£500,000 could save up to Â£5,000. ""The stamp duty relief for first time buyers announced in today's budget will be a welcome boost to people purchasing their first home but the impact will be felt disproportionately in the South of England,"" said Tom Selby, senior analyst at AJ Bell. For all first-time buyers, the deposit is a bigger up-front cost than Stamp Duty. The average deposit across the UK is Â£32,899, according to the Halifax, compared to the average Stamp Duty charge of Â£1,654.What does the stamp duty change mean? Tom Kibasi, of the centre-left think tank the Institute of Public Policy Research (IPPR), said: ""Unaffordable house prices are the problem, not Stamp Duty. For most young people, the stamp duty cut will make little difference. But it will help the beneficiaries of the bank of mum and dad."" The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) pointed out a ""cliff edge"" situation in high-priced areas. A first-time buyer paying Â£500,001 for a home will pay Â£5,000 more in Stamp Duty than someone paying Â£500,000, it said. Other commentators agreed with the OBR that prices will rise as a result.

"Matthew Bravender, left, and Anderson Ward were both jailed for driving offences resulting in fatalities Two road death drug-drivers are trying to get their convictions quashed amid concerns forensic evidence in their cases had been manipulated. The pair, from Greater Manchester and Powys, Wales, want to launch Court of Appeal proceedings. It follows an investigation at Randox Testing Services in Manchester, wheretwo scientists were arrestedon suspicion of tampering with data. The inquiry prompted a review of more than 10,000 criminal investigations. About 50 prosecutions have so far been dropped in what BBC home affairs correspondent Danny Shawdescribedas ""the biggest forensic science scandal in the UK for decades"". Matthew Bravender is appealing against his conviction after pleading guilty to causing death by careless driving while over the legal limit for a prescribed drug. Most of the 10,000 cases that could be affected involved traffic offences The 38-year-old, of Agecroft, Greater Manchester, wasjailed for five years and four monthsat Manchester Crown Court after 52-year-old pedestrian Alan Strong was struck and killed in April 2016. Also challenging his conviction is Anderson Ward, 39, who wasjailed for causing the death of his girlfriendin a crash while he was high on drugs. Marie Hardes, 56, was killed after Ward lost control of a car on the M3 in Winchester in November 2014. He was sentenced to six years in prison after being found guilty of causing death by driving without due care while unfit through drugs, causing death by driving a vehicle unlicensed and possession of Class B and Class C drugs. More appeals could soon follow as thousands of toxicology tests are re-analysed. Three-quarters of the cases were traffic offences such as drug-driving, with the rest including violent crime, sexual offences and unexplained deaths, dating back to 2013. Two men have been arrested and five interviewed under caution by Greater Manchester Police over the alleged manipulation by individuals working at the Randox site. Retests have so far found no impact on cases of sexual offences, violence or murder, the National Police Chiefs' Council said. Potential data manipulation at a separate facility, Trimega Laboratories, isalso being investigated.

"The aircraft was ferrying passengers to the USS Ronald Reagan in the Philippine Sea Eight people have been rescued after a US Navy aircraft carrying 11 crew and passengers crashed off the coast of Japan, the defence ministry has said. It says that preliminary US military reports indicated that engine failure may have caused the crash. The Navy did not say what kind of aircraft was involved, but Japan's Self-Defense Forces have said it was a C-2 transport aircraft. The aircraft was travelling to a US aircraft carrier in the Philippine Sea. Japanese and American rescuers raced to get to the stricken plane, which ditched in seas off the remote Japanese reef of Okinotori. An initial report suggests that the crashed plane may be a C-2 transport aircraft similar to the one photoed above The crash follows a spate of US Navy accidents in East Asia in recent months, some fatal. Ten personnel died in August, when the USS John McCain collided with a tanker near Singapore. Two months earlier, in June, the USS Fitzgerald smashed into a cargo ship off the coast of Japan, killing seven. In two other non-fatal incidents, the USS Antietam ran aground near its base in Japan in January, and in May USS Lake Champlain collided with a South Korean fishing vessel. Japanese Defence Minister Itsunori Onodera said that his department had received an initial US report that engine trouble might have caused Wednesday's accident. More than 60 different types of planes and helicopters operate from the USS Ronald Reagan,according to the carrier group's website,external, including fighters, early warning aircraft, electronic attack planes, transports planes and multi-purpose helicopters. US warship and Japanese tug collide in latest incident USS John S McCain: Navy sacks officers over collision US Navy orders 'operational pause' after collision The US military is strongly deployed in the western Pacific, with tens of thousands of troops and billions of dollars' worth of hardware in the region.

"A Budget has been delivered by Chancellor Philip Hammond which he says will ""help families to cope with the cost of living"". The chancellor has announced plans on tax, housing and travel, alongside an update on the UK's economic position. Here is what it means for you. The stand out feature ofthe Budgetfor first-time buyers living in England, Northern Ireland and, for a time, in Wales is an immediate abolition of stamp duty when buying properties of up to Â£300,000. For properties costing up to Â£500,000, no stamp duty will be paid on the first Â£300,000. The starting point for paying stamp duty in England was Â£125,000. According to the Halifax, the average first-time buyer in the UK had paid about Â£1,660 in stamp duty, on a property costing Â£211,980. However, in many parts of the country first-time buyers pay relatively little in stamp duty. In the North of England, the typical first-time buyer saving would be Â£24, the lender said. The effect will be felt the most in the South East of England where the average home bought by a first-time buyer could save Â£3,948, and in London with a saving of Â£5,000. The Office For Budget Responsibility also pointed out that a subsequent rise in house prices would more than cancel out the benefit from the stamp duty measures, and it will primarily assist existing homeowners, with only an additional 3,500 first-time buyer sales at a significant cost to the Treasury. It does not affect the biggest up-front cost for first-time buyers - the deposit. In the UK, the average deposit is Â£37,101, according to the Halifax. If a couple are buying and only one is a first-time buyer, then they do not get the tax break. It also will do nothing for those trading up, whose numbers have fallen sharply in the last 10 years, or potential downsizers who are put off by the stamp duty cost. Housing is a devolved issue, so there are different rules in the different nations. In Scotland, the equivalent tax is called Land and Buildings Transaction Tax. Here the tax is levied on buyers purchasing homes costing more than Â£145,000 - the same as the average house price for all buyers. New rates havealready been set in Wales for next April, with a starting point tax of 2.5% on properties of more than Â£150,000. The average home in Wales cost Â£153,000 in September, official figures show. The changes announced in the Budget will take effect until then. Scotland and Wales will need to decide whether they follow this measure in England. Northern Ireland, which has the same stamp duty rates as England, has an average house price of Â£132,000. Mr Hammond announced measures that he said would see 300,000 new homes built a year by the mid-2020s. He had signalled this change earlier in the week. Local authorities will be able to increase the council tax premium on empty homes from 50% to 100% ""to encourage owners of empty homes to bring their properties back into use"". Budget calculator At a glance summary: Budget key points Live: Budget reaction and analysis Stamp duty changes explained At present 31 million people pay income tax in the UK. Nearly 26 million of those pay at the basic rate. The amount earned before income tax is paid - called the personal allowance - will rise from Â£11,500 to Â£11,850 in April. This will cut less than Â£100 a year off a basic rate taxpayer's annual bill. It was a Conservative manifesto pledge to increase the personal allowance to Â£12,500 by 2020-21. The higher rate is paid by 5.2 million people. The threshold will rise from Â£45,000 to Â£46,350. The government has already pledged to increase this to Â£50,000 by 2020-21. The threshold is different in Scotland (owing to devolved powers) where it is Â£43,000. The Scottish government will announce its intentions for these rates in December. Universal credit is a new benefit for working-age people, replacing six benefits and merging them into one payment. They are Income Support, income-based Jobseeker's Allowance, income-related employment and support allowance, Housing Benefit, Child Tax Credit and Working Tax Credit. Currently people typically have to wait six weeks for their first payment and one in five wait longer. The chancellor announced various measures to tackle some of the issues raised in a concerted campaign from charities and many MPs. This is likely to cut a week off this wait. New Universal Credit claimants in receipt of Housing Benefit will now continue to receive it for two weeks. The duty on beer, cider and spirits has been frozen this time, although there will be an increase on some high-strength drinks, including some white ciders. There was a 2p increase on a pint of beer and 1p increase in cider announced in the Spring Budget. A bottle of Scotch whisky was increased by 36p in March. The chancellor has now announced an additional duty on hand-rolling tobacco, on top of the previously announced inflation plus 2% rise in tobacco duty which would push up the cost of a packet of 20 cigarettes by 28p. Fuel duty has been frozen again, a move that will be welcomed by many drivers. Many drivers of new diesel cars will see an increase in the road tax they pay in the first year of owning their car from April. They will be levied on one band higher than those with petrol cars, owing to the environmental effect of this type of fuel. This will amount to only about Â£20 for smaller cars, and Â£300 for larger cars, Treasury figures show. At present, there is a sliding scale of charges for the first year of ownership and after that petrol or diesel vehicles are subject to a ""standard"" rate of Â£140 a year. Only those diesel vehicles that do not meet the very latest European emissions standards will be affected. The existing diesel supplement in company car tax is also going up, and there will be less of a tax impact for those who charge up their electric car at work, The government has said people up to 30 years-old will be able to buy a Â£30 railcard for discounted train travel from next spring - an extension of the current young person's railcard for those aged 16 to 25. The so called millennials' card will be available from spring next year, and offer up to a third off non-peak fares, which usually apply on services after 10am. The 3% rise in the state pension in April has been confirmed, amounting to Â£3.65 extra a week. As is usually the case, this is in line with inflation, which measures the cost of living, in September. Changes already earmarked for next April and subsequent financial years include: Many working-age benefits will be halfway through a four-year freeze by April. These include Jobseeker's Allowance, Employment and Support Allowance, some types of Housing Benefit, and Child Benefit. However, state pensions, Maternity Pay and some disability benefits are excluded. This is on course to save the Treasury Â£4.6bn, according to the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) The gradual process allowing people to pass on property to their descendantsfree from some inheritance taxwill enter its second year. It will reach its target by 2021 Many buy-to-let landlords are seeing the amount oftax relief that they can claim on mortgage interest paymentscut over the course of four years. The process began in April. Eventually, they will only be able to claim at the lower rate of tax, not the higher Director shareholders will see a tax break reduced on the dividends they receive. The tax-free dividend allowance - which came into force in 2016 - will be reduced from Â£5,000 to Â£2,000 from April. That will affect those who own a small business and pay themselves in dividends alongside a small salary and people with large portfolios of shares, perhaps by hundreds of pounds Public sector pay in England and Wales was frozen for two years in 2010, except for those earning less than Â£21,000 a year, and since 2013, rises have been capped at 1% At-a-glance summary: Budget key points Budget 2017: Your questions answered Richer or poorer?

"The sale of new diesel cars that do not meet latest emissions standards will face a one-off tax increase in April. It will be levied on all diesels that do not meet the Real Driving Emissions Step 2 standards on emissions for the first year of ownership. According to experts, it means that most new diesels would be subject to the rise. Chancellor Philip Hammond said the tax change would apply only to cars, and ""white van man"" was unaffected. Different rates of Vehicle Excise Duty will be levied according to a car's CO2 emissions band. A Ford Fiesta or Vauxhall Astra would see a one-off Â£20 rise and a Land Rover Discovery a Â£400 increase. Cars in the top band, such as a Porsche Cayenne, would be hit with a Â£500 tax. The chancellor said: ""Drivers buying a new car will be able to avoid this charge as soon as manufacturers bring forward the next-generation cleaner diesels that we all want to see. Live: Budget reaction and analysis At a glance summary: Budget key points What the Budget means for you The move was part of a series of Budget policies designed to improve air quality and promote electric vehicles. The chancellor also unveiled a Â£220m Clean Air Fund, and Â£400m - split equally between the Treasury and motor industry - to improve the charging infrastructure for electric vehicles. There will also be another Â£100m in subsidies to help persuade consumers to buy electric vehicles. The key thing... if you've already got a diesel car, you won't pay more. That's hardly a surprise, bearing in mind people were encouraged to buy diesels some years ago. The government wasn't about to slap a big tax on drivers who parted with lots of money in good faith. From April though, if you are buying a new diesel, you will probably pay more tax in the first year. It depends on the emissions test that it had to pass, so I'd ask the dealer before you buy. The new tax rise will apply until around 2021, by which time all new cars have to meet the tighter pollution rules. And this only applies to cars, not vans, trucks, etc. So, it's more of a soft, brushing nudge rather than a big push to persuade people away from polluting diesels. Of course, there is a danger that it convinces drivers to keep their old, dirtier diesels, rather than buy a new, cleaner one. The UK's motor industry trade body, the SMMT, said the chancellor's diesel tax changes risked sending out mixed messages. Chief executive Mike Hawes said: ""Diesel buyers will not face any additional taxation for the next six months, but thereafter, will face additional charges which will undermine fleet renewal efforts, which are the best and quickest way to address air quality concerns. ""Manufacturers are investing heavily in the latest low emission technology. However, it's unrealistic to think that we can fast-track the introduction of the next generation of clean diesel technology which takes years to develop."" But Peter Williams, of the motoring group RAC, said: ""The chancellor has chosen to be relatively light touch when it comes to taxing new diesel cars. ""Any new diesel car registered from 1st April 2018 will be hit with a higher first year tax rate unless they conform to the latest real world driving standards. ""So current beleaguered owners of diesel cars can breathe a sigh of relief that they will not be punished further by the Treasury - but they will need to keep their eyes on local authorities who may be introducing clean air zones in the near future."" However, he added that a side effect of the Budget announcement might be a risk that drivers will be encouraged to keep their older diesel vehicles.

"People claiming the benefit universal credit will have to wait five weeks, rather than six, to receive their first payment from February 2018. The government had been coming under mounting pressure to act after reports that many people were getting into rent arrears, problem debt or having to use food banks while waiting to receive the benefit. In hisBudgetthe chancellor also announced that housing benefit claimants could continue to receive it for an extra two weeks while waiting for their universal credit payments to start. And advances available to people who need it will be made more generous, covering up to the full value of their claim, rather than a maximum of half. BBC Reality Check wanted to know, how significant is this announcement, in particular the reduction of the six-week wait to five? People claiming universal credit will now wait, to be precise, 35 days rather than 42 before they get their first payment. It's helpful to think of the current waiting period before people can receive their first universal credit in three chunks: Four weeks to assess how much someone has earned in the last month An administrative week set aside to process the payment A further seven ""waiting days"" during which claimants are not eligible for any benefit - this is what the chancellor is scrapping The four weeks is more or less baked into the design of the system. Universal credit was designed to be paid in arrears once a person's monthly income has been assessed. Changing this feature would have required a fairly significant change to the whole structure of the benefit. So it was in the other 14 days that the government had some leeway. The reduction in the waiting period announced in the Budget strips away seven of those extra days, leaving a full week to process the payment. Arguably, the chancellor could have shortened the payment processing time too. Live: Budget reaction and analysis What the Budget means for you At-a-glance summary of the Budget key points It was the seven additional ""waiting days"" many took issue with, since it's difficult to see what purpose those days served other than to save money. David Finch, a senior policy analyst at think tank the Resolution Foundation, described them as a ""completely unnecessary saving"" which had a disproportionate negative impact on claimants. And areport on the six week waiting period,externalby a cross-party group of MPs, chaired by Labour MP Frank Field, described the motivation of those extra days as ""primarily fiscal"". But the motivation behind universal credit was not a cost-saving one - it was supposed to be all about getting more people into work. The report's authors added that they had been told by a wide range of charities, councils and housing associations that the seven waiting days did ""nothing to further the stated objectives of Universal Credit but contribute to claimant hardship."" Just overa third of people eligible for universal credit have always been exempt,externalfrom having to go for seven ""waiting days"" with no benefits. This group includes people who are moving on to universal credit from a relevant existing benefit, those who have claimed Jobseeker's Allowance or Employment Support Allowance in the past three months, young people under the age of 22 leaving local authority care and victims of domestic abuse. The other 64% of new claimants will benefit from this change. The actual number of people will vary - there were 47,000 newpeople starting to receive universal credit,externalin the most recent month we have data for (13 September to 12 October). The new benefit is being introduced in stages Chancellor Philip Hammond said the whole package of reform announced today would cost Â£1.5bn over five years. When it introduced the seven day wait period the government saidthe policy would save Â£150m,externalper year, after universal credit had been rolled out, so it's reasonable to think this is what it would cost them in the future. For the average person claiming the benefit, they'll have Â£73 extra in their pockets plus housing costs and any other elements they qualify for - like childcare support. The Resolution Foundation adds that while this change is important, the waiting time is not the biggest underlying problem with universal credit. So what else could the chancellor have done to reform the benefit? He could have reversed cuts made in 2015 to the ""work allowance"". People with children, or who have a disability which restricts the amount they can work, are currently able to earn up to Â£397 a month before they start losing any benefits. But before April 2016, all claimants could earn a certain amount before their benefits began to be withdrawn and some people could earn up to Â£734 without losing a penny. At the moment this work allowance is assessed by household. Having a work allowance for individuals could strengthen the incentive for the second earner in a family to work. Last Autumn, the chancellor announced a reduction to the taper rate. That's the amount of benefit you lose for every extra pound you earn.  Previously, claimants lost 65p of benefit for every extra pound they earned, and this was reduced to 63p last year. So the chancellor could have opted to reduce this further. And there are other smaller concessions government could make, for example paying eligible claimants their childcare costs upfront rather than making them pay and claim the costs back.

For the average person claiming the benefit, they'll have Â£73 extra in their pockets plus housing costs and any other elements they qualify for - like childcare support. The Resolution Foundation adds that while this change is important, the waiting time is not the biggest underlying problem with universal credit. So what else could the chancellor have done to reform the benefit? He could have reversed cuts made in 2015 to the ""work allowance"". People with children, or who have a disability which restricts the amount they can work, are currently able to earn up to Â£397 a month before they start losing any benefits. But before April 2016, all claimants could earn a certain amount before their benefits began to be withdrawn and some people could earn up to Â£734 without losing a penny. At the moment this work allowance is assessed by household. Having a work allowance for individuals could strengthen the incentive for the second earner in a family to work. Last Autumn, the chancellor announced a reduction to the taper rate. That's the amount of benefit you lose for every extra pound you earn.  Previously, claimants lost 65p of benefit for every extra pound they earned, and this was reduced to 63p last year. So the chancellor could have opted to reduce this further. And there are other smaller concessions government could make, for example paying eligible claimants their childcare costs upfront rather than making them pay and claim the costs back.

"The singer shot to fame in the 1970s US actor and singer David Cassidy, who found fame in The Partridge Family before going on to become a 1970s teen pop idol, has died aged 67. ""David died surrounded by those he loved, with joy in his heart and free from the pain that had gripped him for so long,"" a family statement said. He was admitted to hospital last week after suffering multiple organ failure. Earlier this yearthe singer said he had dementiaand would stop touring in order to ""enjoy life"". This video can not be played Watch David Cassidy performing on Top of the Pops in 1985 Cassidy was born in New York to a family familiar with the entertainment industry. His father was a singer and actor and his mother was an actress. He became a star playing Keith Partridge in The Partridge Family - a 1970s sitcom about a mother and five children who formed a rock and roll band. The show spawned several hit songs, such as I Think I Love You. Following the sitcom he enjoyed a hugely successful career in music and acting. He received Grammy nominations and sold more than 30 million records worldwide. At the peak of his fame in the 1970s, his fan club reportedly had a bigger membership than that of The Beatles and Elvis Presley combined. Hundreds were injured in a stampede at a London concert in 1974, with a girl dying a few days later.  It was an event he said would ""haunt"" him for the rest of his life. In recent years he has spoken about his struggle with alcohol. Cassidy has sold more than 30 million records worldwide In 2015 he filed for bankruptcy. Between 2010 and 2014, he was arrested three times for drink-driving and was ordered to undergo rehab as part of his sentence in 2014. He divorced three times and had two children. Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Leo Sayer, who toured with Cassidy in 2012, said he was ""the perfect pop star"". ""His fans were so dedicated and loyal, he was a sweetheart and so non-threatening. ""He was so important to the music industry, the love that people have for him - he was like Donny Osmond but better,"" Sayer said. Those sentiments were shared by self-proclaimed superfan Allison Pearson, who has written a book about Cassidy's life - called I Think I Love You. She told Today: ""There will be tears in millions of women's eyes today - he was the perfect first love. He had a weird life where he was a demi-god at 21. ""I spoke to him one day and said, 'Many years from now we will hear you've died and it will be an incredibly poignant time for women' and he said, 'A small part of you will die with me,' and I said, 'Yes, it will.'""

"Serious work on restoring Zimbabwe's finances need to begin once the celebrations over Robert Mugabe's departure have ended Current events in Zimbabwe show that while a week may be a long time in politics, it is really a very short blink of an eye in economics. Zimbabweans on the streets of Harare and Bulawayo may be hopeful for political change, but they are much more sanguine and realistic when it comes to improving the country's economy. Presidents can be impeached in days or weeks. It takes years to wreck economies and usually even longer to repair them. So, will Emmerson Mnangagwa be able to take Zimbabwe's economy off life support and at least start to put it on the road to recovery? Analysts are very sceptical that a quick solution is even feasible. The euphoria that has gripped the nation has certainly raised hopes that the future will be brighter, but if that improved sentiment is to deliver economic dividends, the government needs to make some drastic reforms. Cash injection The first tool President Mnangagwa would need to even get a recovery kick-started is hard currency. Zimbabwe hasn't had a currency of its own since 2009, after hyperinflation killed off the old Zimbabwean dollar. Zimbabwe 100 trillion and 500 thousand dollar banknotes, produced after the country experienced a period of hyperinflation Zimbabwe has lost its status as the breadbasket of Africa Since then, the US dollar has been the main currency for transactions, as well as the South African rand. And in recent years a cash shortage has been slowly strangling the economy, which is half the size it was at the turn of the millennium. Ten numbers that will help you understand what's actually going on But who would stump up the cash? Western donors will remain wary of a Zanu-PF government which simply sees Robert Mugabe replaced by Mr Mnangagwa. The International Monetary Fund, which describes Zimbabwe's economy as one of the most fragile in the world, may be more willing - but only with many strings attached to any deal. China is possibly the most likely cash benefactor in the initial stages of a Mnangagwa administration. In some circles, Mr Mnangagwa is seen as Zimbabwe's Deng Xiaoping, the Chinese leader who instigated a degree of market liberalisation. Dump damaging policies and stamp out corruption Assuming the cash is forthcoming, what then? Mr Mnangagwa would have to dump economic policies that are unpalatable to foreign investors. Zimbabwe's agricultural production started to plunge after the government-sanctioned programme of farm seizures came into effect Zimbabwe has a potential labour force that is one of the most skilled in Africa In 2009, Mr Mugabe signed the Indigenisation and Economic Empowerment Act (IEEA) into law, which aimed to place 51% of companies into the hands of Black Zimbabweans. Even some Chinese companies have been forced to close their operations in Zimbabwe in recent years, because the IEEA made it unprofitable to do business in the country. Once considered the breadbasket of Africa, Zimbabwe saw its agricultural production start to plunge at the turn of the century after the government-sanctioned programme of farm seizures. Mugabe has gone, but will Zimbabwe change? Robert Mugabe: Hero or villain? Emmerson Mnangagwa: The 'crocodile' who snapped back Some sources claim that Mr Mnangagwa is keen to revitalise Zimbabwe's commercial farms, and may seek the help of white farmers to do it. Corruption has been a major restraint on economic growth in Zimbabwe for years. Much of the farmland that was seized from white farmers ended up in the hands of army generals and the political elite, who knew next to nothing about agriculture. The farms simply fell into disarray. Likewise, businesses that ended up with people with more political connections than entrepreneurial flair more often than not went to the wall. Three million Zimbabweans are estimated to live outside the country, having fled the dire economic conditions that emerged over the past two decades Not that corruption is confined to Zimbabwe in the African context, but it is one of those places that it seems to trickle down from the top. Just ask any South African who has driven their car across the border and been stopped at a police roadblock. But Mr Mnangagwa has not escaped the corruption criticism. It is alleged that he was at the top of corruption tree when the army effectively took over theMarange diamond fieldsin the east of the country in 2008. At the time, he was the defence minister. That whole affair raised the eyebrows even of Mr Mugabe, who said last year that he felt at least $13bn of revenue had gone missing from the diamond bonanza. Negotiate with foreign lenders For nearly 20 years, Zimbabwe has been in default on $9bn worth of international debt. That debt needs restructuring, probably with the assistance of the IMF and the World Bank. Perhaps a government that did not only include Zanu-PF could even get the debt (or some of it) wiped out. Mr Mnangagwa is thought to be open to a new deal with the IMF, but getting new financing and renegotiating old deals would probably be easier for a unity government which included opposition politicians, especially former Finance Minister Tendai Biti. Create the conditions to reduce unemployment and entice the diaspora to return Formal jobs in Zimbabwe are rare. Unemployment runs at more than 90%. Creating the conditions for investment and seeing that money flows in should have a dramatic short-term effect on unemployment. Western governments will be wary of a Zanu-PF government which simply sees Robert Mugabe replaced by Emmerson Mnangagwa (above) Other conditions already exist: the country has an abundance of natural resources in both agriculture and mining, and a potential labour force that's one of the most skilled in Africa. All it needs is the political will and the right economic conditions for Zimbabwe's unemployment statistics to become rather less stratospheric. Meanwhile, three million Zimbabweans are estimated to live outside the country, having fled the dire economic conditions that emerged over the past two decades. They too have skills which would be useful in the rebuilding of the economy. But they will have to feel they would be landing on solid and stable ground - both financially and politically. Otherwise, why go back? In addition, it could be argued that a Zanu-PF dominated government would not want them back this side of an election. The vast majority of the returning diaspora would be unlikely to vote for Mr Mnangagwa and his party. Create its own currency In the longer term, Zimbabwe needs to have its own currency. Using the US dollar was necessary after the old Zim dollar became worth less than the paper it was printed on and met its demise. Banks in Zimbabwe have been feeling the strain in recent months But there is so much more to creating a viable currency than switching on a printing press. Confidence is key. Last year, the Reserve Bank introduced ""bond notes"" which were meant to alleviate the chronic shortage of US dollars in the system. However, many thought this was an attempt to re-introduce the Zim dollar via the back door. Mugabe's long career in pictures The polarising Grace Mugabe How Zimbabweans celebrated In fact, the notes have done nothing to address the cash shortage and some analysts say they might have actually made the situation worse, by pushing up the demand for US dollars even further. Few people like using the bond notes, even though the amount in circulation is relatively low and the denominations are small. Putting money into a bank was no longer considered the soundest of options, because the cash could only be withdrawn in small amounts and there was always the fear that the Reserve Bank would come for your hard-earned dollars. So, the stock market soared, ironically becoming one of the best performing bourses in the world. Indeed, the rise in the stock market has only been curtailed by the army intervention and the resignation of Mr Mugabe.

"This video can not be played Anne Wafula-Strike said it was ""vital"" it did not happen to other people A Paralympian has been compensated after wetting herself on a train when the disabled toilet was not working. Anne Wafula-Strike, 48, was on a three-hour CrossCountry train from Nuneaton to Stansted in December with an out-of-order accessible loo. The wheelchair racer, from Harlow, said train staff knew she needed to use the toilet but when they reached a station it was too late. CrossCountry has apologised and made a confidential payment. A CrossCountry spokesman said since what happened on 8 December, a ""thorough review"" had been undertaken. He added: ""While we have apologised for the events that day, a lot of good has also resulted from this, with the whole rail industry looking at ways to make Britain's railways a more accessible environment, alongside the Department for Transport's ongoing consultation on an Accessibility Action Plan."" Wheelchair racer Mrs Wafula-Strike became a member of Paralympics GB in 2007 The deadline for the Accessibility Action Plan's consultation ends on Wednesday. Kenya-born Mrs Wafula-Strike, who is a board member of UK Athletics and has an MBE for services to disability sport, has said disabled travellers need the ""support of the Government to hold transport companies to account"". Mrs Wafula-Strike had been returning from a UK Athletics board meeting when she needed to use the toilet and asked the ticket master if they could let her off at the next stop after seeing the out-of-order sign. However, Mrs Wafula-Strike said there was nobody to help her at that station and on the way to the following station she ""ended up wetting"" herself, which was ""humiliating"".

"Colombian navy divers are searching for 10 people who disappeared on Tuesday after their boats capsized in the Orinoco river, which divides Colombia from Venezuela. A total of 18 people were on board the boats, eight of whom were rescued. Witnesses said one of the boats had a mechanical problem and was being towed by the other one when they hit a rock about 30m (100ft) from the shore. The accident happened 10km (6.2 miles) downstream from Puerto CarreÃ±o. A local government official, Diego ZÃ¡rate, said of the eight people rescued two were Colombians and six Venezuelans. Among the missing are thought to be a number of children. Witnesses said the boat with mechanical problems was transporting watermelons while the one that came to its rescue was carrying passengers. But a Colombian navy official said he did not know what the two vessels were doing navigating the fast-flowing river in the early hours of Tuesday when it was still dark. A search of the riverbanks has so far yielded no result.

"What a way to start the week - settling down to watch one of the major events of the year that affects your finances. In his speech, the chancellor will announce the government's plans for tax and spending for the financial year which starts in April 2019. Here is your essential guide. It is on Monday, 29 October, at about 15:30 GMT. Three aspects of the timing are relatively unusual. Firstly, it is earlier in the year than usual to avoid clashing with the final stage of Brexit negotiations in November. Five things to watch for in the Budget Philip Hammond prepares last Budget before Brexit Secondly, the Budget is being presented on a Monday, normally it is revealed on a Wednesday after Prime Minister's Questions. This year that would mean it would fall on Halloween - a gift to headline writers - although the government denies that was a factor in choosing the day. Thirdly, the Chancellor will start his speech at about 15:30 GMT, three hours later than usual. That's because Parliamentary business starts later on a Monday because MPs have to travel to London from their constituencies. The speech usually lasts about an hour, although the longest continuous Budget speech was by William Gladstone in 1853, lasting four hours and 45 minutes. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn then gets the first response, before MPs debate the Budget. Arguably, the second most powerful person in government, behind the Prime Minister. He was appointed as chancellor - known in many countries as the finance minister - in July 2016. Philip Hammond (right) has not got much spare cash (left) to spend Mr Hammond entered Parliament at the relatively late age of 41 as a millionaire. He has been the Conservative MP for Runnymede and Weybridge since 1997. He has been dubbed ""Spreadsheet Phil"" owing to his love of numbers, including running over finances while on the beach on holiday. No. Many powers, as well as some tax issues, are devolved to the nations of the UK. Expect more on those in the coming weeks. One big announcement will be the Scottish government's intentions on income tax levels, to be outlined at its Budget on 12 December. The Budget comes hot on the heels of the Conservative Party conference, during which Prime Minister Theresa May claimed that austerity is coming to an end. ""The British people need to know that the end is in sight,"" she said. That could be rather restrictive for Mr Hammond, who needs to raise extra money somehow. The government has committed to finding an extra Â£20bn for the NHS by 2023. Ministers have indicated it will be partly funded by tax rises, so all eyes are on the chancellor for a solution. Mrs May also said that the borrowing cap for local councils wanting to build new homes will be scrapped, potentially adding to the national debt. As usual, there have been a host of Treasury announcements in the run-up to the speech ranging from potholes to interest-free loans. Of course. This is the final Budget when the UK is part of the European Union, so how the economy is prepared for the UK's exit will clearly be a significant, and closely watched, part of the speech. Arguably, the nature of any deal struck with the EU - or the failure to reach any kind of deal - would have a much bigger impact on the nation's finances than anything Mr Hammond says in the Budget. The chancellor has already said a new Budget would be needed if the UK and the EU cannot agree a Brexit deal. The Chancellor sets the so-called ""sin taxes"" on cigarettes and booze. So, at the end of Budget day, any change in these duties will come into effect and is likely to have an immediate impact on prices. The Chancellor has special permission to drink alcohol during the speech, although the last one to do so was Kenneth Clarke, who had a whisky. In her party conference speech, Mrs May scotched speculation that fuel duty could go up for the first time in nearly a decade, saying she was extending the duty freeze for a ninth year in a row, a move costing the Exchequer Â£800m. That said, petrol prices are relatively high, so drivers are already feeling the pinch. There is some speculation that the level of income at which workers pay income tax could be frozen, despite a Conservative pledge at the 2017 election that the thresholds would rise to Â£12,500 by 2020. The starting point for the higher rate of tax was also pledged to rise to Â£50,000 by 2020. Many working-age benefits are nearly three years through a four-year freeze. These include Jobseeker's Allowance, Employment and Support Allowance, some types of Housing Benefit, and Child Benefit. The cap on public sector pay rises in England and Wales has been in place in some form since 2010, although there is nowsome flexibility in pay awards for public servants. The cap has effectively been lifted, with more significant pay rises for police, NHS workers and others. However, these increases have needed to come from departmental budgets so a squeeze on funding still exists. The real detail on all of these plans, and how much they will cost or save, is in the Budget red book - a fat document published as soon as the chancellor has sat down after his speech. At about the same time next year. If you cannot wait that long, then there is the spring statement, usually in late February or early March, which updates the state of the nation's finances. There is always the chance of a mini-Budget, or a major financial statement of some kind, if and when a Brexit deal is announced.

This year that would mean it would fall on Halloween - a gift to headline writers - although the government denies that was a factor in choosing the day. Thirdly, the Chancellor will start his speech at about 15:30 GMT, three hours later than usual. That's because Parliamentary business starts later on a Monday because MPs have to travel to London from their constituencies. The speech usually lasts about an hour, although the longest continuous Budget speech was by William Gladstone in 1853, lasting four hours and 45 minutes. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn then gets the first response, before MPs debate the Budget. Arguably, the second most powerful person in government, behind the Prime Minister. He was appointed as chancellor - known in many countries as the finance minister - in July 2016. Philip Hammond (right) has not got much spare cash (left) to spend Mr Hammond entered Parliament at the relatively late age of 41 as a millionaire. He has been the Conservative MP for Runnymede and Weybridge since 1997. He has been dubbed ""Spreadsheet Phil"" owing to his love of numbers, including running over finances while on the beach on holiday. No. Many powers, as well as some tax issues, are devolved to the nations of the UK. Expect more on those in the coming weeks. One big announcement will be the Scottish government's intentions on income tax levels, to be outlined at its Budget on 12 December. The Budget comes hot on the heels of the Conservative Party conference, during which Prime Minister Theresa May claimed that austerity is coming to an end. ""The British people need to know that the end is in sight,"" she said. That could be rather restrictive for Mr Hammond, who needs to raise extra money somehow. The government has committed to finding an extra Â£20bn for the NHS by 2023. Ministers have indicated it will be partly funded by tax rises, so all eyes are on the chancellor for a solution. Mrs May also said that the borrowing cap for local councils wanting to build new homes will be scrapped, potentially adding to the national debt. As usual, there have been a host of Treasury announcements in the run-up to the speech ranging from potholes to interest-free loans. Of course. This is the final Budget when the UK is part of the European Union, so how the economy is prepared for the UK's exit will clearly be a significant, and closely watched, part of the speech. Arguably, the nature of any deal struck with the EU - or the failure to reach any kind of deal - would have a much bigger impact on the nation's finances than anything Mr Hammond says in the Budget. The chancellor has already said a new Budget would be needed if the UK and the EU cannot agree a Brexit deal. The Chancellor sets the so-called ""sin taxes"" on cigarettes and booze. So, at the end of Budget day, any change in these duties will come into effect and is likely to have an immediate impact on prices. The Chancellor has special permission to drink alcohol during the speech, although the last one to do so was Kenneth Clarke, who had a whisky. In her party conference speech, Mrs May scotched speculation that fuel duty could go up for the first time in nearly a decade, saying she was extending the duty freeze for a ninth year in a row, a move costing the Exchequer Â£800m. That said, petrol prices are relatively high, so drivers are already feeling the pinch. There is some speculation that the level of income at which workers pay income tax could be frozen, despite a Conservative pledge at the 2017 election that the thresholds would rise to Â£12,500 by 2020. The starting point for the higher rate of tax was also pledged to rise to Â£50,000 by 2020. Many working-age benefits are nearly three years through a four-year freeze. These include Jobseeker's Allowance, Employment and Support Allowance, some types of Housing Benefit, and Child Benefit. The cap on public sector pay rises in England and Wales has been in place in some form since 2010, although there is nowsome flexibility in pay awards for public servants. The cap has effectively been lifted, with more significant pay rises for police, NHS workers and others. However, these increases have needed to come from departmental budgets so a squeeze on funding still exists. The real detail on all of these plans, and how much they will cost or save, is in the Budget red book - a fat document published as soon as the chancellor has sat down after his speech. At about the same time next year. If you cannot wait that long, then there is the spring statement, usually in late February or early March, which updates the state of the nation's finances. There is always the chance of a mini-Budget, or a major financial statement of some kind, if and when a Brexit deal is announced.

"It wasn't a drama - it wasn't a Budget that would inspire queues at the Box Office. No surprise. When ""Box Office Phil"" was given that nickname, it wasn't because he has a reputation for delivering political thrillers. What he tried to do was to act on concerns expressed at the general election and by rebels on the Tory backbenches as well as the Labour opposition. So there were changes to the universal credit benefit, some, but certainly not all the money the NHS says it needs - and an enormous sounding figure of Â£44bn for housing over the next five years (although vital to wait for the detail of how much will go to getting spades in the ground, and how much will guarantee loans for the housing industry). Stamp duty cut for first time buyers Budget key points at-a-glance But he made a bigger-than-expected move to ""revive the home-owning dream"" by scrapping stamp duty on the first Â£300,000 of any property bought by a first-time buyer. The prime minister has set her own personal reputation on fixing the housing crisis, so there is a lot riding on the mixture of moves that has been promised by Philip Hammond today. He also responded to pressure from Brexit-backing colleagues in cabinet, by putting aside an extra Â£3bn to plan for a ""no deal"" scenario. What the chancellor also tried to do was to claim that somehow a corner has been turned in the long-term battle to sort out the country's books, with debt peaking and starting to fall as a share of national income. But it will be tricky for the government to escape the overall picture: that the economy looks like it will be more sluggish, will grow more slowly and will be less productive than expected for some time to come.

"Growth forecasts for the UK economy have been cut sharply following changes to estimates of productivity and business investment. The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) now expects the economy to grow by 1.5% this year, down from the estimate of 2% it made in March. Growth, it says, will drop to 1.3% by 2020 and then rise to 1.5% in 2021. The lower growth means that by 2021-22 government tax receipts will be Â£20bn lower than the OBR's March forecast. The OBR expects borrowing as a share of economic output will still fall, but not as fast as it predicted in March. It forecasts that borrowing this year will be 2.4% of Gross Domestic Product (GDP), rather than its previous prediction of 2.9%. By 2021-22, it says that percentage will be down to 1.3%. However, in March, it had expected borrowing to have fallen to 0.7% of GDP by then. Live: Budget reaction and analysis At a glance summary: Budget key points What the Budget means for you The figures make it harder for the Chancellor, Philip Hammond, to hit his target of bringing borrowing down to less than 2% of GDP by 2020-21. In March, the OBR estimated borrowing would then be at 0.9% of GDP. Today's forecast is for it to be at 1.5%. In his Budget speech, Mr Hammond said: ""Regrettably our productivity performance continues to disappoint. Today the OBR revised down the outlook for productivity growth, business investment and GDP growth."" Yael Selfin, chief economist at KPMG UK, said: ""The downgrade to UK GDP growth forecasts has totally overshadowed the generally good news on public finances so far this fiscal year, reducing the money available to the chancellor. ""However, the chancellor is sticking to his target of reducing public borrowing to less than 2% of national income by 2020-21, albeit with a reduced chest for any emergency spending in the event the economy requires an additional boost."" John Hawksworth, chief economist at PwC, said: ""The headroom he used to have between his target and the forecast represented about Â£20-26bn. That's now been reduced to about Â£15bn because of less growth and more borrowing. ""He is trying to walk a tightrope of fiscal prudence and austerity."" The OBR says in itsEconomic and Fiscal Outlook report,externalthat the impact of lower productivity means that GDP will grow by 5.7% over the next five years rather than by the 7.5% as it estimated in March. It added: ""We expect real GDP growth to slow from 1.5% this year to 1.4% in 2018 and 1.3% in 2019, as public spending cuts intensify and Brexit-related uncertainty continues to bear down on activity."" However, it said that the revisions to productivity had nothing to do with Brexit, or with the latest economic figures, but simply because of what it called a ""repeated tendency throughout the post-crisis period for productivity growth to disappoint"". Ian Stewart, chief economist at Deloitte, said: ""The OBR's view that weak productivity is here to stay, and is not just a lingering hangover from the financial crisis, means a longer haul to eliminate the deficit and slower wage growth."" The OBR has also cut its estimates for business investment. Its report said: ""We now expect business investment to rise by around 12% between the first quarter of 2017 and the first quarter of 2022, significantly lower than the 19% expected in March. ""This downward revision reflects the weaker outlook for productivity growth lowering the expected return on capital."" On unemployment, the OBR said it believed the rate was now as low as it is going to go. ""We expect the rate to trough at 4.3% of the labour force - its current rate - in the second half of this year, and then to edge up as GDP growth slows a little further and the National Living Wage prices some workers out of employment.""

"This video can not be played The chancellor abolishes stamp duty on homes under Â£300,000 to help first-time buyers. Chancellor Philip Hammond has given a sobering assessment of the economy, saying it is expected to grow more slowly than previously thought. But he sought to rally Conservative MPs in his Budget by scrapping stamp duty for the first Â£300,000 spent by first-time buyers, a saving of up to Â£5,000. The cut will apply to buyers in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. Mr Hammond also promised Â£1.5bn to ""address concerns"" about the flagship universal credit scheme. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said the government had a ""record of failure"". Key points at-a-glance: A Budget summary Budget Live: Rolling text and video updates What the Budget 2017 means for you In depth: The BBC's Budget coverage At the start of his speech, Mr Hammond struck a positive note, saying the economy continued to ""confound those who seek to talk it down"" by creating jobs and continuing to grow. But he then said productivity levels remained ""stubbornly flat"" with growth until 2021 expected to be lower than predicted in March. It is the first time in a generation that growth is forecast to grow below 2% every year. Mr Hammond's statement came with him under pressure from Eurosceptic Tory MPs and others calling for more spending to ease austerity. The chancellor - who has been accused of being too pessimistic about life outside the EU - said Â£3bn would be spent on Brexit planning, and that the government would prepare for ""every possible outcome"" Freezing alcohol duty apart from an increase in duty on high-strength white ciders The price of 20 cigarettes goes up by 28p and by 41p for 30g of rolling tobacco A promise to fund a pay rise for nurses if one is recommended by an independent panel Refunds onVAT for Scottish emergency services A one-offtax on new diesel carsthat do not meet latest emissions standards Â£28m for Kensington and Chelsea council for counselling and regeneration in the aftermath of the Grenfell Tower fire Bringing forward a plannedcut in business rate risesby two years to 2018 An extraÂ£2.8bn for the NHSin England up to 2022 Support for electric cars including a Â£400m charging infrastructure fund Anew railcardoffering discounts to those aged between 26 and 30 Housing had been billed as one of the key themes of the Budget - and the chancellor promised the ""next generation"" that getting on the housing ladder would not be just a ""dream"". Promising the government would deliver 300,000 new homes a year, he pledged Â£44bn capital investment and measures aimed at getting building projects started. And towards the end of his speech he made the pledge on stamp duty, which is paid by people buying properties over a certain value. Rates vary across the UK - in England, Wales and Northern Ireland it kicks in at Â£125,000 - and in Scotland, which has its own devolved tax - at Â£145,000. The cut will only operate in Wales until the matter is devolved next April and stamp duty replaced by a land transaction tax. Mr Hammond said his change would benefit 95% of first-time buyers. But in its assessment, the Office for Budget Responsibility said the main gainers would be those who already own a home. It also said it would lead to higher house prices and predicted it would only lead to an extra 3,500 first-time buyer purchases. Among the Â£44bn package was a pledge to make it easier for councils to build in areas of high housing need. There was also a threat to intervene with compulsory purchase orders if landowners and developers were found to be holding back on building ""for commercial rather than technical reasons"". Mr Hammond said investing more money alone would simply inflate prices and make matters worse. He added: ""Solving the housing challenge takes more than money, it takes planning reform. We will focus on the urban areas where people want to live... building high quality, high density homes."" As well as spending announcements, the chancellor also uses his Budget to update MPs on the state of the economy. And they cast a shadow on his other announcements, with the Office for Budget Responsibility predicting the economy would grow by 1.5% this year, down from the estimate of 2% it made in March. Growth, it says, will drop to 1.3% by 2020 and then rise to 1.5% in 2021, lower in every year than was predicted in March. Borrowing was predicted to be Â£8.4bn lower than in March, but long-term deficit predictions were hiked to Â£34.7bn in 2019, going down to Â£30.1bn in 2021. Mr Hammond said he was still on track to hit his target to balance the nation's books by the middle of the next decade. Sharp cut to UK growth forecast Another high-profile announcement was on universal credit, which is the government's major reform to the way benefits are paid and is currently being rolled out across the UK. Campaigners and MPs in all parties have been calling for changes to the way it is managed. The Â£1.5bn will remove a mandatory seven-day wait after someone submits a claim, taking the overall wait down from six weeks to five. Mr Hammond also said it would become  easier for claimants to receive an advance. Reality Check: What do Universal Credit reforms mean? This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn: ""So much for tackling injustices"" Responding in the Commons, Mr Corbyn predicted the Budget would unravel, warning ""misery"" will continue for people across the country. He cited falling wages and added that economic growth in the first three quarters of this year was the lowest since 2009. The Labour leader also noted the lack of major social care policies in Mr Hammond's statement. And he reacted angrily to a heckle from the Tory benches as he said elderly people were not receiving good enough care. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"So hear us out: Today could change your life for the better. Chancellor Philip Hammond is in charge of the UK's finances and will be delivering his Budget statement. That's where he'll set out how he intends to spend the country's money over the next year and beyond. And with his party desperate to appeal to young voters, this is the one to pay attention to. The man in charge of our money Philip Hammond can't afford to mess this Budget up. Since the general election in June, his party has been desperately trying to claw young voters away from Jeremy Corbyn's Labour party and to the Tories. The majority of younger peoplevoted for Labour. But Philip Hammond's got his own party to worry about, too. He's not entirely loved by his colleagues in the cabinet right now. Which means he has to go with big, bold ideas and changes - or his job could be on the line. It's likely that the budgetwill be dominated by the issue of housing. We know there's a problem with young people and housing - as government minister Sajid Javid saidin a recent speech,external, the average age of a first-time buyer is 32. Chancellor Philip Hammond says the answer - to sky-high rent as well as house prices - is tobuild more houses. There's talk that he could reduce or get rid ofstamp duty,externalfor first-time buyers. That's a tax you pay when you buy a house, which rises as the house gets more expensive. But there's always a worry that these schemes won't benefit the right people. Often, it's existing landlords who benefit through higher house prices or rent going up. Plus with house prices so high, would a fall of a couple of thousand pounds really encourage new buyers? This reduction could just benefit people who were able to afford houses in the first place - making it useless. The Labour party's election pledge to scrap student fees was a hit with young people One of Jeremy Corbyn's flagship ideas during the general election was to scrap tuition fees, which are currently Â£9,250 a year. The Tories said the country couldn't afford this. But, seeing how popular it was among young people, they need to tap into the student debt issue. It's very unlikely that they'll reduce fees. But there's a possibility that they might wipe off some of the huge debt recent graduates are in - it's estimated that more than three in four students who started uni this September won't repay their loans in full. Another possible move is to put a cap on the interest rate you have to pay on your loan. At the moment, with interest rates at 6.1%, students will graduate with an average of Â£5,800 in interest alone. It does fall once you graduate (it depends on your income), but that's way higher than the interest you'd pay on a normal loan. One thing that we know for certain is that the amount you earn before you start paying it back will change in April 2018, from Â£21,000 to Â£25,000 a year. Patrick had to wait eight weeks to get his universal credit There's beena lot in the newsrecently about waiting times foruniversal credit, which merges six different benefits, including jobseeker's allowance and housing benefits. But the system includes a six-week waiting time to get the money, which can leave a lot of people in the lurch. ""I was without money for eight weeks. Sometimes I didn't eat for a week,"" Patrick, 22, who is on universal credit, tells Newsbeat. ""I had to borrow money off my friends, and get other loans out too, so I'm in a lot of debt right now. ""There just needs to be a drastic change."" But the Budget is more likely to include only small tweaks to the system. The waiting time could be reduced - but won't go below four weeks. Public sector workers have been calling for a pay rise over 1% Since 2013, public sector workers have had pay rises capped at 1% a year. But prices have risen by more than that each year, which means that your wage doesn't go as far. That pay rise capwas relaxedin September - but only for police and prison officers. Now there's speculation that it might also bescrapped for teachers and nurses. The government hasalready revealedsome of its spending on technology in Wednesday's budget. Included in this will beÂ£160m spent on superfast 5Gmobile networks across the UK. The technology isn't fully there yet, but Philip Hammond wants it in around 2020, partly because he wants driverless cars using 5G to be on the roads by 2021. But is the government trying to run before it can walk? Many rural placesdon't even have decent broadband yet, let alone 4G or even 3G availability. However, part of the technology investment is to go on improving networks on trains and motorways, which might go some way towards alleviating the problem.

"The Scottish government has dismissed the chancellor's pledge of extra funding for Holyrood as a ""con"". Philip Hammond said moves in his Autumn Budget would ""mean Â£2bn more for the Scottish government"". But Scotland's finance secretary said Holyrood had been ""short changed"", and that funds for day to day spending would actually fall. Ministers have also traded barbs over plans to allow Scotland's police and fire services to claim VAT refunds. Mr Hammond took aim at ""SNP obstinacy"" over the issue, while the SNP's Westminster leader Ian Blackford accused the UK government of ""vindictiveness and nastiness"" for not having made the change sooner. Budget 2017: Live updates and reaction At-a-glance summary: Budget key points Sharp cut to UK growth forecast The disputed funds come in the form of Barnett consequentials, which are Scotland's share of additional spending in England which falls in areas of devolved competence - like health, education and housing. The Â£2bn cited by Mr Hammond is spread over the period from the current financial year through to 2020-21, and includes more than Â£1.1bn in financial transaction funding. This is capital funding for loan or equity initiatives, like ""help to buy"" schemes, meaning the government is constrained in how it is spent. Scotland's finance secretary, Derek Mackay - who will unveil his own draft budget in December - said it was ""money with strings attached"" which could not be spent ""directly on frontline public services"" and would eventually have to be repaid to the Treasury. He said the overall deal was ""disappointing"", telling the BBC's Politics Scotland programme that ""it's not a Â£2bn boost to Scotland, it's a con"". But Scottish Secretary David Mundell told the same programme there would be a ""significant increase in Scottish government spending"". On the capital funds, he said the Scottish government could ""use that money in innovative ways"", saying: ""The money is definitely available. It's for the Scottish government to come forward with the mechanisms that allow it to be used. ""Additional money is coming to Scotland and directly will benefit Scotland."" Derek Mackay said the claims of extra funding for Scotland were a ""con"" Mr Mackay also claimed the block grant for day to day spending was being cut in real terms, something refuted by the UK government. The Fraser of Allander Institute, an economic think tank based at the University of Strathclyde, said the extra funding for the resource budget amounted to ""around Â£350m"", saying it ""remains on track to be squeezed in real terms over the next two years"". Director Graeme Roy said: ""The challenge therefore remains for Derek Mackay as to how best to balance the resource budget with major commitments like additional support for the NHS, more money for childcare and public sector pay uplifts all to be paid for."" The other point of conflict between the governments is over VAT for the Scottish police and fire services, after Mr Hammond confirmed they would be eligible for refunds from April 2018. This brings Police Scotland and the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service into line with their counterparts elsewhere in the UK - but tax paid since the creation of the national forces will not be reimbursed. The two services pay about Â£35m a year in VAT - bringing the total bill since they were set up four years ago to Â£140m. Scottish ministers have repeatedly called on the UK government to end the ""glaring disparity"" in the way that VAT affects emergency services across the UK, pointing out that territorial police and fire services in England and Wales already get refunds on their VAT bills. Scotland's police and fire services pay about Â£35m a year in VAT The UK government says the Scottish government knew of the VAT implications before the police and fire service mergers were approved, but pressed on with them regardless. In his budget speech, Mr Hammond said he had been persuaded by Scottish Conservative MPs to make the change. He added: ""The SNP knew the rules, they knew the consequences of introducing these bodies, and they ploughed ahead anyway. ""But my Scottish Conservative colleagues have persuaded me that the Scottish people should not lose out just because of the obstinacy of the SNP government."" On spending, Mr Hammond trumpeted a ""boost"" for Scotland in the shape of Â£2bn extra. He said he had ""delivered for Scotland"". In response, Derek Mackay said it was a ""con"". The money was over four years (the Chancellor never disguised that) - and more than half of the dosh was in the form of financial transactions. These have caused contention in the past. They are, in essence, loan funds available for private projects such as housing, business or agriculture. They fall, thus, to be repaid. Scottish ministers readily concede that such funds have proved valuable in the past - although they tend, discreetly, to cite their own deftness in finding useful vehicles. But they say it is cash with strings and it leaves day-to-day spending on the NHS, education and the like facing a real-terms cut. At which point, Mr Mundell says that the total package going to Scotland will be helpful. At which pointâ¦..you get the concept. Read more from Brian here The chancellor also said progress was being made on city deals for Tay Cities and Stirling, and for a growth deal for Borderlands. And he said the government would introduce transferable tax history for oil and gas fields in the North Sea - which he described as an ""innovative tax policy that will encourage new entrants to bring fresh investment to a basin that still holds up to 20 billion barrels of oil"". Many of the measures announced by Mr Hammond - such as homebuyers no longer having to pay stamp duty for properties of up to Â£300,000 - will not apply in Scotland, where the tax is devolved and known as Land and Buildings Transaction Tax. It will be up to the Scottish government in its own forthcoming budget to decide whether to follow the chancellor's lead. In alengthy Twitter thread,external, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon welcomed the announcements on oil and gas, and on VAT. But she said both were ""overdue"", and that it was ""disappointing and unfair to emergency services"" that VAT that had already been paid would not be refunded. The chancellor said a freeze on spirit duty would benefit the Scotch whisky industry Among the other budget measures which the Treasury said would impact on Scotland were: A freeze on spirits duty, which it said would give distillers the confidence needed to invest and grow their businesses and encourage new firms to enter the market Fuel duty will be frozen, with support for islands extended Â£3.3m support for Scottish charities The chancellor said the budget was proof that the Conservative government was ""giving power back to the people of Britain and driving prosperity and greater fairness across our United Kingdom"". But he also said that the Office for Budget Responsibility had revised down forecasts for Britain's GDP to 1.5% in 2017, down from the 2% it had previously predicted. Scottish Labour's new leader, Richard Leonard, said Mr Hammond had ""delivered a failing budget, on a failing economy from a failing government"". He added: ""They are rudderless and without a plan to grow our economy, help our industries and create the work of the future. This Tory government is a driverless vehicle. This budget is insufficient, inadequate and insincere.""

"The chancellor has been urged to deliver a ""cautious"" Budget or risk alienating investors. Rupert Harrison, former chief of staff to George Osborne, said that Philip Hammond should not radically change strategy by increasing borrowing significantly. Mr Hammond is under pressure to be ""big and bold"" inthe Budgetwhich he will deliver at 12.30pm. He will say that he is ""optimistic"" about the future of the UK economy. But with a major downgrade expected to productivity - the ability of the economy to create wealth - his room for spending giveaways will be limited. Mr Harrison told the BBC that with Brexit uncertainty and nervousness about the direction the UK economy is heading, the markets would be keener on a ""steady as she goes"" message. ""You don't want to surprise the world by saying we're embarking on a new strategy, we're going to borrow lots of money, raise taxes,"" he said. ""I think in a moment when the world has got some question marks about the UK anyway, it's time for a bit of consistency and a bit of patience."" Budget to make UK 'fit for Brexit future' Budget 2017: What you need to know Why isnât the UK more productive? Rupert Harrison is now a senior figure at BlackRock, one of the largest investment firms in the world with over Â£4 trillion of funds under its control. The government relies on international investors to fund its deficit, the difference between what it spends on services and receives in taxes. And the cost of servicing that debt is rising as inflation (a lot of government debt is linked to the rise in prices) and interest rates rise. Mr Harrison said that the chancellor did have some limited wriggle room. ""If we look at the big picture, back in 2010, we had a budget deficit of 10% of GDP [the country's Gross Domestic Product, or national income],"" he said. ""That was very high and I think a risk to economic stability. It needed to be dealt with [and] that deficit is now just 3% of GDP."" He added: ""That means that it's not an urgent immediate issue - the chancellor has a little bit of wriggle room to maybe spend a little bit more on infrastructure, a little bit on housing. ""But I don't think he should abandon the longer-term ambition to keep the public finances under control and start getting our debt down, because in the end the UK is still vulnerable."" It is expected that the Office for Budget Responsibility - the official economic watchdog - will downgrade its forecasts for growth and productivity when it publishes its economic outlook report alongside the Budget. Lower productivity means the economy expands less quickly and the government receives less in tax revenues and may have to borrow more. It also means that people are less likely to receive higher wage increases. He believes his ""fiscal rule"" - a promise to balance the government's public finances by 2025 - is vital to investor confidence in the UK economy. But, with borrowing slightly lower than expected, Mr Hammond is expected to announce a major package of support for new housing as well as more spending on infrastructure such as digital broadband and 5G mobile. It is possible he will also announce more spending on health, although it is unlikely to be the Â£4bn demanded by the chief executive of the NHS, Simon Stevens. There have been calls to reverse corporation tax cuts, which are due to fall to 17% by 2020. But that would appear to be a direct contradiction of a pledge in the Conservative election manifesto to ""stick to the plan"" to cut the tax. Mr Harrison said that halting further cuts to business taxes might be possible: ""But I think you need to be careful about the signals you send if you put it up"". ""I think there's much more nervousness about the UK than there was around the world,"" Mr Harrison said. ""We used to be seen as a very predictable, reliable, business friendly place to come to do business and to invest, I think people are now starting to question that [and are asking] what is it the UK really wants?"" He said that people do not really understand the whole Brexit process which he said has raised the level of uncertainty. ""So I think that puts a premium for the UK government on trying to signal as much certainty as it can, trying to reduce that uncertainty, set out a clear strategy,"" Mr Harrison said. ""The next time we have an economic downturn, with high levels of debt, a big banking system, it's a question of how much patience do we have to really put ourselves in the best possible position for the future."" He said: ""I think financial markets wouldn't punish the UK in the short term if there was a little bit more spending on infrastructure, if there were good projects that could be shown to produce good economic returns. ""I think where there would be more concern is if there was a sense that the UK government was essentially abandoning its ambitions to deal with the public finances longer term.""

"This video can not be played The chancellor abolishes stamp duty on homes under Â£300,000 to help first-time buyers. Chancellor Philip Hammond has given a sobering assessment of the economy, saying it is expected to grow more slowly than previously thought. But he sought to rally Conservative MPs in his Budget by scrapping stamp duty for the first Â£300,000 spent by first-time buyers, a saving of up to Â£5,000. The cut will apply to buyers in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. Mr Hammond also promised Â£1.5bn to ""address concerns"" about the flagship universal credit scheme. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said the government had a ""record of failure"". Key points at-a-glance: A Budget summary Budget Live: Rolling text and video updates What the Budget 2017 means for you In depth: The BBC's Budget coverage At the start of his speech, Mr Hammond struck a positive note, saying the economy continued to ""confound those who seek to talk it down"" by creating jobs and continuing to grow. But he then said productivity levels remained ""stubbornly flat"" with growth until 2021 expected to be lower than predicted in March. It is the first time in a generation that growth is forecast to grow below 2% every year. Mr Hammond's statement came with him under pressure from Eurosceptic Tory MPs and others calling for more spending to ease austerity. The chancellor - who has been accused of being too pessimistic about life outside the EU - said Â£3bn would be spent on Brexit planning, and that the government would prepare for ""every possible outcome"" Freezing alcohol duty apart from an increase in duty on high-strength white ciders The price of 20 cigarettes goes up by 28p and by 41p for 30g of rolling tobacco A promise to fund a pay rise for nurses if one is recommended by an independent panel Refunds onVAT for Scottish emergency services A one-offtax on new diesel carsthat do not meet latest emissions standards Â£28m for Kensington and Chelsea council for counselling and regeneration in the aftermath of the Grenfell Tower fire Bringing forward a plannedcut in business rate risesby two years to 2018 An extraÂ£2.8bn for the NHSin England up to 2022 Support for electric cars including a Â£400m charging infrastructure fund Anew railcardoffering discounts to those aged between 26 and 30 Housing had been billed as one of the key themes of the Budget - and the chancellor promised the ""next generation"" that getting on the housing ladder would not be just a ""dream"". Promising the government would deliver 300,000 new homes a year, he pledged Â£44bn capital investment and measures aimed at getting building projects started. And towards the end of his speech he made the pledge on stamp duty, which is paid by people buying properties over a certain value. Rates vary across the UK - in England, Wales and Northern Ireland it kicks in at Â£125,000 - and in Scotland, which has its own devolved tax - at Â£145,000. The cut will only operate in Wales until the matter is devolved next April and stamp duty replaced by a land transaction tax. Mr Hammond said his change would benefit 95% of first-time buyers. But in its assessment, the Office for Budget Responsibility said the main gainers would be those who already own a home. It also said it would lead to higher house prices and predicted it would only lead to an extra 3,500 first-time buyer purchases. Among the Â£44bn package was a pledge to make it easier for councils to build in areas of high housing need. There was also a threat to intervene with compulsory purchase orders if landowners and developers were found to be holding back on building ""for commercial rather than technical reasons"". Mr Hammond said investing more money alone would simply inflate prices and make matters worse. He added: ""Solving the housing challenge takes more than money, it takes planning reform. We will focus on the urban areas where people want to live... building high quality, high density homes."" As well as spending announcements, the chancellor also uses his Budget to update MPs on the state of the economy. And they cast a shadow on his other announcements, with the Office for Budget Responsibility predicting the economy would grow by 1.5% this year, down from the estimate of 2% it made in March. Growth, it says, will drop to 1.3% by 2020 and then rise to 1.5% in 2021, lower in every year than was predicted in March. Borrowing was predicted to be Â£8.4bn lower than in March, but long-term deficit predictions were hiked to Â£34.7bn in 2019, going down to Â£30.1bn in 2021. Mr Hammond said he was still on track to hit his target to balance the nation's books by the middle of the next decade. Sharp cut to UK growth forecast Another high-profile announcement was on universal credit, which is the government's major reform to the way benefits are paid and is currently being rolled out across the UK. Campaigners and MPs in all parties have been calling for changes to the way it is managed. The Â£1.5bn will remove a mandatory seven-day wait after someone submits a claim, taking the overall wait down from six weeks to five. Mr Hammond also said it would become  easier for claimants to receive an advance. Reality Check: What do Universal Credit reforms mean? This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn: ""So much for tackling injustices"" Responding in the Commons, Mr Corbyn predicted the Budget would unravel, warning ""misery"" will continue for people across the country. He cited falling wages and added that economic growth in the first three quarters of this year was the lowest since 2009. The Labour leader also noted the lack of major social care policies in Mr Hammond's statement. And he reacted angrily to a heckle from the Tory benches as he said elderly people were not receiving good enough care. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"This video can not be played NHS services in England will get an extra Â£2.8bn, the chancellor says in his Budget speech The extra money announced by the chancellor in the Budget for the NHS in England is not enough, health service bosses say. Philip Hammond announced an immediate Â£350m boost for this winter followed by Â£1.6bn more next year for the front line above the rise already planned. The chancellor described it as an ""exceptional"" measure, which recognised the pressures the service was under. But NHS leaders have already warned waiting times will continue to worsen.  Can't find your health trust?Browse the full list Rather search by typing?Back to search If you can't see the NHS Tracker,click or tap here,external. The Budget announcement comes after independent experts had called for Â£4bn extra next year and NHS England boss Simon Stevens had warned ministers the public expected increased investment following claims made during the EU referendum that the NHS would benefit financially from Brexit. Mr Stevens said without action waiting times for key services would continue to worsen. Responding to the Budget, NHS England chairman Sir Malcolm Grant said the extra money would go only ""some way towards filling the accepted funding cap"". And he said the country could ""no longer avoid the difficult debate"" about what the health service could deliver for patients. Chris Hopson, chief executive of NHS Providers, which represents health service managers, said ""tough choices and trade offs"" would now need to be made. ""It is difficult to see how the NHS can deliver everything,"" he added. In total, Mr Hammond announced an extra Â£2.8bn of funding over the next three years. Â£350m this year Â£1.6bn in 2018-19 Â£850m in 2019-20 That is on top of the rises already set out by the government's spending plans made in 2015, which would have seen the front-line budget rise by Â£9bn in cash terms to nearly Â£116bn. Mr Hammond described the NHS as one of the country's ""greatest institutions"", but said he recognised it was ""under pressure"". He said that was why he was taking the exceptional step of announcing extra funding outside of the formal spending review process. ""We will always back it,"" he told MPs. He also said any pay rises for NHS staff next year - the 1% cap is being lifted - would not need to come from the front-line budget. ""Nurses deserve our deepest gratitude."" Some will say the reaction of those in the health sector is to be expected - they are never satisfied they have enough money. But a look back at the funding history of the NHS shows they have a point. Traditionally the health budget has got an extra 4% a year above inflation to help it cope with the ageing population and cost of new drugs and treatments. Since 2010 that figure has dropped to close to 1% - and this extra money does little to improve that. Those working in accident and emergency units point out that the Â£350m for this winter could easily be swallowed up by spending on agency staff. It is why staff on the front line are still predicting rising waiting times for treatment.

"This video can not be played What happened to Lebanese PM Saad Hariri? Lebanese Prime Minister Saad Hariri has ""suspended"" his resignation, which sparked a crisis when he announced it while in Saudi Arabia two weeks ago. Mr Hariri said President Michel Aoun had asked him to ""put it on hold ahead of further consultations"". The two men held talks a day after Mr Hariri flew back to Lebanon. Mr Hariri has denied that Saudi Arabia forced him to resign and detained him in an attempt to curb the influence of Iran and its Lebanese proxy Hezbollah. Hezbollah is part of a national unity government formed by Mr Hariri last year. Why Saudi Arabia and Iran are bitter rivals Iran and Saudi Arabia: Who's siding with whom Riyadh's night of long knives and long-range missiles ""Today I presented my resignation to his excellency the president, and he asked me to temporarily suspend submitting it and to put it on hold ahead of further consultations on the reasons for it,"" Mr Hariri said after Wednesday's meeting at the Baabda presidential palace. ""I expressed my agreement to this request, in the hope that it will form a serious basis for a responsible dialogue."" Michel Aoun met Saad Hariri at the presidential palace a day after the prime minister's return Mr Hariri said Lebanon required ""exceptional effort from everyone"" at this time in order to ""protect it in confronting dangers and challenges"". He also reiterated the need to remain committed to Lebanon's state policy of ""dissociation regarding wars, external struggles, regional disputes and everything that harms internal stability"" - an apparent reference to the activities of Hezbollah. The Shia Islamist movement acknowledges fighting alongside government forces in Syria and Iraq, and arming Palestinian militants. But it denies advising and sending weapons to rebel forces in Yemen's civil war and militants in Bahrain. By Martin Patience, BBC News, Beirut The fact that Saad Hariri's resignation has been delayed will be seen as a blow to Saudi Arabia. Many here believe Riyadh pressurised him to resign in order to bring about the Lebanese government's collapse. Lebanon is now centre stage in the power struggle between Saudi Arabia and Iran. There is likely to be days of backroom dealing in order resolve this crisis. But the solution will need to involve the regional powers and the international community. Significantly, Mr Hariri has opened the possibility that he may stay in power if Hezbollah respects Lebanon's policy of staying out of regional conflicts. On Monday, Hezbollah's leader denied sending arms to Yemen and a number of other Arab states, and said he could pull its fighters out of Iraq once so-called Islamic State was defeated there. But that is unlikely to appease a wounded Saudi Arabia. Earlier on Wednesday, Mr Hariri was embraced by Mr Aoun as the two men attended an independence day military parade in Beirut. The president, a Maronite Christian former army commander and ally of Hezbollah who publicly accused Saudi Arabia of detaining the prime minister, appeared to tell him: ""Welcome back!"" This video can not be played Lebanese President Michel Aoun greets returning Prime Minister Saad Hariri Mr Hariri left Riyadh for France at the weekend with his wife and one of his three children. He flew to Lebanon on Tuesday, stopping in Egypt and Cyprus en route. On Monday, Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah said in a speech that he still considered Mr Hariri prime minister and that the militant Shia Islamist movement was ""open to any dialogue and any discussing that happens"" in Lebanon. Mr Hariri announced his resignation in a televised address on 4 November from Riyadh, in which he accused Iran of sowing ""discord, devastation and destruction"" in the region and said he sensed there was an assassination plot against him. Mr Hariri's supporters celebrated his return to Lebanon on Tuesday night His father Rafik - himself a former prime minister - was killed in a car bombing in Beirut in 2005. Several members of Hezbollah are being tried in absentia at a UN-backed tribunal in connection with the attack, though the group denies any involvement. Mr Hariri, a Sunni Muslim who became prime minister for the second time in late 2016 in a political compromise deal that also saw Mr Aoun elected president, has close ties to Saudi Arabia. He holds both Lebanese and Saudi citizenship and has extensive business interests there. Riyadh also backs his political party, the Future Movement. What happened to Lebanese PM Hariri?

"This video can not be played The chancellor abolishes stamp duty on homes under Â£300,000 to help first-time buyers. Chancellor Philip Hammond has given a sobering assessment of the economy, saying it is expected to grow more slowly than previously thought. But he sought to rally Conservative MPs in his Budget by scrapping stamp duty for the first Â£300,000 spent by first-time buyers, a saving of up to Â£5,000. The cut will apply to buyers in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. Mr Hammond also promised Â£1.5bn to ""address concerns"" about the flagship universal credit scheme. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said the government had a ""record of failure"". Key points at-a-glance: A Budget summary Budget Live: Rolling text and video updates What the Budget 2017 means for you In depth: The BBC's Budget coverage At the start of his speech, Mr Hammond struck a positive note, saying the economy continued to ""confound those who seek to talk it down"" by creating jobs and continuing to grow. But he then said productivity levels remained ""stubbornly flat"" with growth until 2021 expected to be lower than predicted in March. It is the first time in a generation that growth is forecast to grow below 2% every year. Mr Hammond's statement came with him under pressure from Eurosceptic Tory MPs and others calling for more spending to ease austerity. The chancellor - who has been accused of being too pessimistic about life outside the EU - said Â£3bn would be spent on Brexit planning, and that the government would prepare for ""every possible outcome"" Freezing alcohol duty apart from an increase in duty on high-strength white ciders The price of 20 cigarettes goes up by 28p and by 41p for 30g of rolling tobacco A promise to fund a pay rise for nurses if one is recommended by an independent panel Refunds onVAT for Scottish emergency services A one-offtax on new diesel carsthat do not meet latest emissions standards Â£28m for Kensington and Chelsea council for counselling and regeneration in the aftermath of the Grenfell Tower fire Bringing forward a plannedcut in business rate risesby two years to 2018 An extraÂ£2.8bn for the NHSin England up to 2022 Support for electric cars including a Â£400m charging infrastructure fund Anew railcardoffering discounts to those aged between 26 and 30 Housing had been billed as one of the key themes of the Budget - and the chancellor promised the ""next generation"" that getting on the housing ladder would not be just a ""dream"". Promising the government would deliver 300,000 new homes a year, he pledged Â£44bn capital investment and measures aimed at getting building projects started. And towards the end of his speech he made the pledge on stamp duty, which is paid by people buying properties over a certain value. Rates vary across the UK - in England, Wales and Northern Ireland it kicks in at Â£125,000 - and in Scotland, which has its own devolved tax - at Â£145,000. The cut will only operate in Wales until the matter is devolved next April and stamp duty replaced by a land transaction tax. Mr Hammond said his change would benefit 95% of first-time buyers. But in its assessment, the Office for Budget Responsibility said the main gainers would be those who already own a home. It also said it would lead to higher house prices and predicted it would only lead to an extra 3,500 first-time buyer purchases. Among the Â£44bn package was a pledge to make it easier for councils to build in areas of high housing need. There was also a threat to intervene with compulsory purchase orders if landowners and developers were found to be holding back on building ""for commercial rather than technical reasons"". Mr Hammond said investing more money alone would simply inflate prices and make matters worse. He added: ""Solving the housing challenge takes more than money, it takes planning reform. We will focus on the urban areas where people want to live... building high quality, high density homes."" As well as spending announcements, the chancellor also uses his Budget to update MPs on the state of the economy. And they cast a shadow on his other announcements, with the Office for Budget Responsibility predicting the economy would grow by 1.5% this year, down from the estimate of 2% it made in March. Growth, it says, will drop to 1.3% by 2020 and then rise to 1.5% in 2021, lower in every year than was predicted in March. Borrowing was predicted to be Â£8.4bn lower than in March, but long-term deficit predictions were hiked to Â£34.7bn in 2019, going down to Â£30.1bn in 2021. Mr Hammond said he was still on track to hit his target to balance the nation's books by the middle of the next decade. Sharp cut to UK growth forecast Another high-profile announcement was on universal credit, which is the government's major reform to the way benefits are paid and is currently being rolled out across the UK. Campaigners and MPs in all parties have been calling for changes to the way it is managed. The Â£1.5bn will remove a mandatory seven-day wait after someone submits a claim, taking the overall wait down from six weeks to five. Mr Hammond also said it would become  easier for claimants to receive an advance. Reality Check: What do Universal Credit reforms mean? This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn: ""So much for tackling injustices"" Responding in the Commons, Mr Corbyn predicted the Budget would unravel, warning ""misery"" will continue for people across the country. He cited falling wages and added that economic growth in the first three quarters of this year was the lowest since 2009. The Labour leader also noted the lack of major social care policies in Mr Hammond's statement. And he reacted angrily to a heckle from the Tory benches as he said elderly people were not receiving good enough care. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"A group of MPs has said that the Â£18bn cost of the UK's new Hinkley Point C nuclear power station will hit the country's poorest the hardest. The Public Accounts Committee said that households had been ""locked into an expensive deal lasting 35 years"". In a report, it said there were no plans for Hinkley Point to provide wider benefits such as jobs and skills. But EDF, the French firm funding two thirds of the project, said it would bring ""huge benefits"" to Britain. The government gave the green light to Hinkley Point near Bridgwater in Somerset last year, in a deal which guarantees EDF a fixed price of Â£92.50 per megawatt hour for the electricity it produces for 35 years. If it falls below that level, consumers will pay the difference. The Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy estimates that top-up payments will cost consumers around Â£30bn. In its report examining the deal, the Public Accounts Committee said: ""Over the life of the contract, consumers are left footing the bill and the poorest consumers will be hit hardest. Yet in all the negotiations no part of government was really championing the consumer interest."" The committee's chair Meg Hillier said: ""Bill-payers have been dealt a bad hand by the government in its approach to this project. ""Its blinkered determination to agree the Hinkley deal, regardless of changing circumstances, means that for years to come energy consumers will face costs running to many times the original estimate. ""It doesn't know what UK workers and business will gain from this project, and appears to have no coherent idea of what to do about it."" The committee has proposed that the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy: Needs to draw up a plan to create wider economic benefits from Hinkley Point and explain how they will prove they have been achieved. Should commission an independent assessment of its effect on consumers Publish a strategic case for nuclear before any more plants are agreed Ensure proper cost/risk analysis of the funding options for all future big infrastructure projects Provide a Plan B for the UK's energy security if Hinkley Point runs into trouble Ensure thorough monitoring of Hinkley Point's construction EDF Energy said: ""The cost of Hinkley Point C for customers has not changed and they will pay nothing for its reliable, low carbon electricity until the station is completed. ""The agreed price is lower than 80% of other low carbon capacity contracted so far and the project has restarted UK nuclear construction after a quarter century.   Construction is fully underway and is already delivering a huge benefit to British jobs, skills and industrial strategy. The company said: ""It is drawing on firms from across Britain and the South-West with 2,400 employees at the site and is on track to meet its next milestones."" The Committee's proposals follow a report in June by the National Audit Office which called Hinkley Point C ""a risky and expensive project"" and said the costs and risks for consumers had not been sufficiently considered.

"Pundits and politicians like to set tests for Budgets. They like to say a chancellor ""has"" to do this or that, they must ""prove"" they have the ambition to do this, to ""deliver"" on a party's manifesto promises, the list goes on. But what do you do if you're the chancellor and you have no majority to speak of, not much  money to spend within the rules you have set for yourself, and you work for a prime minister who doesn't have very much authority? Live: The latest Budget build-up Hammond: I'll make Britain 'fit for the future' Simple, your biggest job is to avoid screwing up. That won't be written on the first page of the chancellor's red book, or in the speech he'll carry in his red box. But that clear and not necessarily very exciting goal will be hanging in the air in the Commons today. Of course Philip Hammond won't admit as much, he won't stand at the despatch box and tell the country ""listen, I am just for the next 40 minutes or so going to try to keep myself out of trouble"". And there will of course be decisions announced today that will have an impact on people's lives. There will be more money for the NHS, although not as much as they have asked for, there will be new policies to try to encourage house-building, there will probably be changes to universal credit, there will be measures that will make a difference to firms around the country. But for the Treasury today there's no big bazooka - boring is good. It is possible of course that the Treasury has simply been managing expectations. By leading people to believe there's not much to see, anything that seems a modest success might feel like a decent win. But the first political responsibility of Number 11 today is to try to avoid mistakes. Inspiring? Perhaps not. Vital to the prospects for the government and Philip Hammond's career? Most definitely so.

"The chancellor has been urged to deliver a ""cautious"" Budget or risk alienating investors. Rupert Harrison, former chief of staff to George Osborne, said that Philip Hammond should not radically change strategy by increasing borrowing significantly. Mr Hammond is under pressure to be ""big and bold"" inthe Budgetwhich he will deliver at 12.30pm. He will say that he is ""optimistic"" about the future of the UK economy. But with a major downgrade expected to productivity - the ability of the economy to create wealth - his room for spending giveaways will be limited. Mr Harrison told the BBC that with Brexit uncertainty and nervousness about the direction the UK economy is heading, the markets would be keener on a ""steady as she goes"" message. ""You don't want to surprise the world by saying we're embarking on a new strategy, we're going to borrow lots of money, raise taxes,"" he said. ""I think in a moment when the world has got some question marks about the UK anyway, it's time for a bit of consistency and a bit of patience."" Budget to make UK 'fit for Brexit future' Budget 2017: What you need to know Why isnât the UK more productive? Rupert Harrison is now a senior figure at BlackRock, one of the largest investment firms in the world with over Â£4 trillion of funds under its control. The government relies on international investors to fund its deficit, the difference between what it spends on services and receives in taxes. And the cost of servicing that debt is rising as inflation (a lot of government debt is linked to the rise in prices) and interest rates rise. Mr Harrison said that the chancellor did have some limited wriggle room. ""If we look at the big picture, back in 2010, we had a budget deficit of 10% of GDP [the country's Gross Domestic Product, or national income],"" he said. ""That was very high and I think a risk to economic stability. It needed to be dealt with [and] that deficit is now just 3% of GDP."" He added: ""That means that it's not an urgent immediate issue - the chancellor has a little bit of wriggle room to maybe spend a little bit more on infrastructure, a little bit on housing. ""But I don't think he should abandon the longer-term ambition to keep the public finances under control and start getting our debt down, because in the end the UK is still vulnerable."" It is expected that the Office for Budget Responsibility - the official economic watchdog - will downgrade its forecasts for growth and productivity when it publishes its economic outlook report alongside the Budget. Lower productivity means the economy expands less quickly and the government receives less in tax revenues and may have to borrow more. It also means that people are less likely to receive higher wage increases. He believes his ""fiscal rule"" - a promise to balance the government's public finances by 2025 - is vital to investor confidence in the UK economy. But, with borrowing slightly lower than expected, Mr Hammond is expected to announce a major package of support for new housing as well as more spending on infrastructure such as digital broadband and 5G mobile. It is possible he will also announce more spending on health, although it is unlikely to be the Â£4bn demanded by the chief executive of the NHS, Simon Stevens. There have been calls to reverse corporation tax cuts, which are due to fall to 17% by 2020. But that would appear to be a direct contradiction of a pledge in the Conservative election manifesto to ""stick to the plan"" to cut the tax. Mr Harrison said that halting further cuts to business taxes might be possible: ""But I think you need to be careful about the signals you send if you put it up"". ""I think there's much more nervousness about the UK than there was around the world,"" Mr Harrison said. ""We used to be seen as a very predictable, reliable, business friendly place to come to do business and to invest, I think people are now starting to question that [and are asking] what is it the UK really wants?"" He said that people do not really understand the whole Brexit process which he said has raised the level of uncertainty. ""So I think that puts a premium for the UK government on trying to signal as much certainty as it can, trying to reduce that uncertainty, set out a clear strategy,"" Mr Harrison said. ""The next time we have an economic downturn, with high levels of debt, a big banking system, it's a question of how much patience do we have to really put ourselves in the best possible position for the future."" He said: ""I think financial markets wouldn't punish the UK in the short term if there was a little bit more spending on infrastructure, if there were good projects that could be shown to produce good economic returns. ""I think where there would be more concern is if there was a sense that the UK government was essentially abandoning its ambitions to deal with the public finances longer term.""

"This video can not be played The chancellor abolishes stamp duty on homes under Â£300,000 to help first-time buyers. Chancellor Philip Hammond has given a sobering assessment of the economy, saying it is expected to grow more slowly than previously thought. But he sought to rally Conservative MPs in his Budget by scrapping stamp duty for the first Â£300,000 spent by first-time buyers, a saving of up to Â£5,000. The cut will apply to buyers in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. Mr Hammond also promised Â£1.5bn to ""address concerns"" about the flagship universal credit scheme. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said the government had a ""record of failure"". Key points at-a-glance: A Budget summary Budget Live: Rolling text and video updates What the Budget 2017 means for you In depth: The BBC's Budget coverage At the start of his speech, Mr Hammond struck a positive note, saying the economy continued to ""confound those who seek to talk it down"" by creating jobs and continuing to grow. But he then said productivity levels remained ""stubbornly flat"" with growth until 2021 expected to be lower than predicted in March. It is the first time in a generation that growth is forecast to grow below 2% every year. Mr Hammond's statement came with him under pressure from Eurosceptic Tory MPs and others calling for more spending to ease austerity. The chancellor - who has been accused of being too pessimistic about life outside the EU - said Â£3bn would be spent on Brexit planning, and that the government would prepare for ""every possible outcome"" Freezing alcohol duty apart from an increase in duty on high-strength white ciders The price of 20 cigarettes goes up by 28p and by 41p for 30g of rolling tobacco A promise to fund a pay rise for nurses if one is recommended by an independent panel Refunds onVAT for Scottish emergency services A one-offtax on new diesel carsthat do not meet latest emissions standards Â£28m for Kensington and Chelsea council for counselling and regeneration in the aftermath of the Grenfell Tower fire Bringing forward a plannedcut in business rate risesby two years to 2018 An extraÂ£2.8bn for the NHSin England up to 2022 Support for electric cars including a Â£400m charging infrastructure fund Anew railcardoffering discounts to those aged between 26 and 30 Housing had been billed as one of the key themes of the Budget - and the chancellor promised the ""next generation"" that getting on the housing ladder would not be just a ""dream"". Promising the government would deliver 300,000 new homes a year, he pledged Â£44bn capital investment and measures aimed at getting building projects started. And towards the end of his speech he made the pledge on stamp duty, which is paid by people buying properties over a certain value. Rates vary across the UK - in England, Wales and Northern Ireland it kicks in at Â£125,000 - and in Scotland, which has its own devolved tax - at Â£145,000. The cut will only operate in Wales until the matter is devolved next April and stamp duty replaced by a land transaction tax. Mr Hammond said his change would benefit 95% of first-time buyers. But in its assessment, the Office for Budget Responsibility said the main gainers would be those who already own a home. It also said it would lead to higher house prices and predicted it would only lead to an extra 3,500 first-time buyer purchases. Among the Â£44bn package was a pledge to make it easier for councils to build in areas of high housing need. There was also a threat to intervene with compulsory purchase orders if landowners and developers were found to be holding back on building ""for commercial rather than technical reasons"". Mr Hammond said investing more money alone would simply inflate prices and make matters worse. He added: ""Solving the housing challenge takes more than money, it takes planning reform. We will focus on the urban areas where people want to live... building high quality, high density homes."" As well as spending announcements, the chancellor also uses his Budget to update MPs on the state of the economy. And they cast a shadow on his other announcements, with the Office for Budget Responsibility predicting the economy would grow by 1.5% this year, down from the estimate of 2% it made in March. Growth, it says, will drop to 1.3% by 2020 and then rise to 1.5% in 2021, lower in every year than was predicted in March. Borrowing was predicted to be Â£8.4bn lower than in March, but long-term deficit predictions were hiked to Â£34.7bn in 2019, going down to Â£30.1bn in 2021. Mr Hammond said he was still on track to hit his target to balance the nation's books by the middle of the next decade. Sharp cut to UK growth forecast Another high-profile announcement was on universal credit, which is the government's major reform to the way benefits are paid and is currently being rolled out across the UK. Campaigners and MPs in all parties have been calling for changes to the way it is managed. The Â£1.5bn will remove a mandatory seven-day wait after someone submits a claim, taking the overall wait down from six weeks to five. Mr Hammond also said it would become  easier for claimants to receive an advance. Reality Check: What do Universal Credit reforms mean? This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn: ""So much for tackling injustices"" Responding in the Commons, Mr Corbyn predicted the Budget would unravel, warning ""misery"" will continue for people across the country. He cited falling wages and added that economic growth in the first three quarters of this year was the lowest since 2009. The Labour leader also noted the lack of major social care policies in Mr Hammond's statement. And he reacted angrily to a heckle from the Tory benches as he said elderly people were not receiving good enough care. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"This video can not be played The chancellor abolishes stamp duty on homes under Â£300,000 to help first-time buyers. Chancellor Philip Hammond has given a sobering assessment of the economy, saying it is expected to grow more slowly than previously thought. But he sought to rally Conservative MPs in his Budget by scrapping stamp duty for the first Â£300,000 spent by first-time buyers, a saving of up to Â£5,000. The cut will apply to buyers in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. Mr Hammond also promised Â£1.5bn to ""address concerns"" about the flagship universal credit scheme. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said the government had a ""record of failure"". Key points at-a-glance: A Budget summary Budget Live: Rolling text and video updates What the Budget 2017 means for you In depth: The BBC's Budget coverage At the start of his speech, Mr Hammond struck a positive note, saying the economy continued to ""confound those who seek to talk it down"" by creating jobs and continuing to grow. But he then said productivity levels remained ""stubbornly flat"" with growth until 2021 expected to be lower than predicted in March. It is the first time in a generation that growth is forecast to grow below 2% every year. Mr Hammond's statement came with him under pressure from Eurosceptic Tory MPs and others calling for more spending to ease austerity. The chancellor - who has been accused of being too pessimistic about life outside the EU - said Â£3bn would be spent on Brexit planning, and that the government would prepare for ""every possible outcome"" Freezing alcohol duty apart from an increase in duty on high-strength white ciders The price of 20 cigarettes goes up by 28p and by 41p for 30g of rolling tobacco A promise to fund a pay rise for nurses if one is recommended by an independent panel Refunds onVAT for Scottish emergency services A one-offtax on new diesel carsthat do not meet latest emissions standards Â£28m for Kensington and Chelsea council for counselling and regeneration in the aftermath of the Grenfell Tower fire Bringing forward a plannedcut in business rate risesby two years to 2018 An extraÂ£2.8bn for the NHSin England up to 2022 Support for electric cars including a Â£400m charging infrastructure fund Anew railcardoffering discounts to those aged between 26 and 30 Housing had been billed as one of the key themes of the Budget - and the chancellor promised the ""next generation"" that getting on the housing ladder would not be just a ""dream"". Promising the government would deliver 300,000 new homes a year, he pledged Â£44bn capital investment and measures aimed at getting building projects started. And towards the end of his speech he made the pledge on stamp duty, which is paid by people buying properties over a certain value. Rates vary across the UK - in England, Wales and Northern Ireland it kicks in at Â£125,000 - and in Scotland, which has its own devolved tax - at Â£145,000. The cut will only operate in Wales until the matter is devolved next April and stamp duty replaced by a land transaction tax. Mr Hammond said his change would benefit 95% of first-time buyers. But in its assessment, the Office for Budget Responsibility said the main gainers would be those who already own a home. It also said it would lead to higher house prices and predicted it would only lead to an extra 3,500 first-time buyer purchases. Among the Â£44bn package was a pledge to make it easier for councils to build in areas of high housing need. There was also a threat to intervene with compulsory purchase orders if landowners and developers were found to be holding back on building ""for commercial rather than technical reasons"". Mr Hammond said investing more money alone would simply inflate prices and make matters worse. He added: ""Solving the housing challenge takes more than money, it takes planning reform. We will focus on the urban areas where people want to live... building high quality, high density homes."" As well as spending announcements, the chancellor also uses his Budget to update MPs on the state of the economy. And they cast a shadow on his other announcements, with the Office for Budget Responsibility predicting the economy would grow by 1.5% this year, down from the estimate of 2% it made in March. Growth, it says, will drop to 1.3% by 2020 and then rise to 1.5% in 2021, lower in every year than was predicted in March. Borrowing was predicted to be Â£8.4bn lower than in March, but long-term deficit predictions were hiked to Â£34.7bn in 2019, going down to Â£30.1bn in 2021. Mr Hammond said he was still on track to hit his target to balance the nation's books by the middle of the next decade. Sharp cut to UK growth forecast Another high-profile announcement was on universal credit, which is the government's major reform to the way benefits are paid and is currently being rolled out across the UK. Campaigners and MPs in all parties have been calling for changes to the way it is managed. The Â£1.5bn will remove a mandatory seven-day wait after someone submits a claim, taking the overall wait down from six weeks to five. Mr Hammond also said it would become  easier for claimants to receive an advance. Reality Check: What do Universal Credit reforms mean? This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn: ""So much for tackling injustices"" Responding in the Commons, Mr Corbyn predicted the Budget would unravel, warning ""misery"" will continue for people across the country. He cited falling wages and added that economic growth in the first three quarters of this year was the lowest since 2009. The Labour leader also noted the lack of major social care policies in Mr Hammond's statement. And he reacted angrily to a heckle from the Tory benches as he said elderly people were not receiving good enough care. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Liberal Democrat leader Sir Vince Cable criticised the Â£3bn being spent on leaving the EU, saying the cash was ""disappearing down a Brexit black hole"".

"This video can not be played Ratko Mladic's trial in numbers Former Bosnian Serb commander Ratko Mladic has been jailed for life for genocide and other atrocities in the 1990s Bosnian war. Known as the ""Butcher of Bosnia"", Mladic led forces during the massacre of Bosnian Muslims (Bosniaks) in Srebrenica and the siege of Sarajevo. The UN tribunal in The Hague convicted him on 10 of the 11 charges. Mladic, 74, was not in court when the sentence was read out. He had been removed for shouting at the judges. ""It's a lie. Everything you said in this courtroom is a lie,"" he said. The outburst came after the judges rejected a request by his team to halt the proceedings because of Mladic's high blood pressure. Mladic has denied all the charges and his lawyer said he would appeal. Profile: The ""Butcher of Bosnia"" What is the case against Mladic? Mladic was the military commander of Bosnian Serb forces against Bosnian Croat and Bosniak armies. He had been on trial at the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) since 2012. It found that Mladic ""significantly contributed"" to the genocide in Srebrenica in 1995, where more than 7,000 Bosniak men and boys were murdered, the worst atrocity in Europe since World War Two. He was cleared of a second count of genocide in other municipalities. The other charges included war crimes and crimes against humanity. This video can not be played ""The soil here is soaked with blood"" - survivor Mevludin Oric Presiding judge Alphons Orie read out many crimes committed by troops under Mladic's command, including: Mass rapes of Bosniak  women and girls Keeping Bosniak prisoners in appalling conditions - starving, thirsty and sick - and beating them Terrorising civilians in Sarajevo by shelling and sniping at them Deporting Bosniaks forcibly en masse Destroying Bosniaks' homes and mosques At the end of the war in 1995 Mladic went into hiding and lived in obscurity in Serbia, protected by family and elements of the security forces. He was finally tracked down and arrested at a cousin's house in rural northern Serbia in 2011 after 16 years on the run. Mladic's days in the Scheveningen prison in The Hague have been taken up with playing chess, reading history books, watching TV and exercise. His usual chess rival is former Bosnian Serb President Radovan Karadzic, who was alsoconvicted of genocide and war crimes in the Bosnian warin 2016. Victims and their relatives watched the verdict in a memorial centre near Srebrenica, and erupted in cheers as it was read out. The group Mothers of Srebrenica said it was partially satisfied, and some relatives said Mladic deserved a harsher sentence. What now for Bosnia victims as Hague tribunal closes? Victims and their relatives watched the verdict in a memorial centre near Srebrenica The BBC's Anna Holligan in The Hague says victims filed out of the courtroom in victorious mood into the sunshine. Fikret Alic, the man whose skeletal image on the front cover of Time magazine shocked the world in 1992, smiled as he tucked into a cheese sandwich. He said he hoped Mladic's behaviour would mean the Serb general would go down in history as a coward who was not brave enough to face up to his own crimes. By Guy Delauney, BBC News, Sarajevo A relative mourns one of the Srebrenica massacre victims No cheers could be heard on the streets of the Bosnian capital ... ""The verdict won't make any changes,"" said Resad Trbonja, a native of Sarajevo who became a teenage soldier to defend the city during the siege, that left more than 10,000 people dead. ""What we need to fight now is the legacy of the war - we're still living it."" Read Guy's full report here. Chief prosecutor Serge Brammertz said the verdict was not a judgement on the Serbian people and that Mladic's guilt was his alone. UN human rights chief Zeid Ra'ad al-Hussein called Mladic the ""epitome of evil"" and said his prosecution was ""the epitome of what international justice is all about"". In early July 1995, Bosnian Serb forces besieged an area near the town of Srebrenica. It had been designated a United Nations ""safe zone"" and was being guarded by 600 lightly armed Dutch UN soldiers. The Serbs attacked from the south, prompting thousands of Bosniak civilians and fighters to flee north to Srebrenica. As the Serb advance continued, refugees fled north to the main Dutch base in Potocari. Gen Mladic summoned the Dutch commander, Col Thom Karremans, and demanded that the Bosniaks disarm to save their lives. LISTEN: Testifying against Mladic On 12 July, some 15,000 Bosniak men of military age broke out of the enclave. They were shelled as they fled through the mountains. Some were also killed after surrendering. Buses then deported an estimated 23,000 women and children to Bosniak territory, while the Serbs separated out all males from age 12 to 77. On 13 July the first killings of unarmed Bosniaks took place in the nearby village of Kravica. Over four days, up to 8,000 Bosniak men and boys were murdered by Bosnian Serbs at sites around Srebrenica. April 1992: Bosniaks take cover from shelling in Sarajevo Civilians in the Bosnian capital endured a brutal siege during 1992-1995 at the hands of Bosnian Serb forces, who fired down into the city from the surrounding hills. The death toll was more than 10,000. It was part of what prosecutors call a Serb ""criminal enterprise"" to spread terror among Bosniaks and Croats, and to drive them from areas claimed as Serb territory.

Do join us for all the latest breaking news and analysis from the business world. The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) is not impressed withthe one-off tax on new diesel carsthat do not meet the latest emissions standards. The SMMT's chief executive Mike Hawes says there's a danger that ""mixed messages"" around diesel - all the stop and go if you like - will confuse the public: there are no additional taxes for the next six months, but then there will be an extra levy. All the while when we want firms and consumers to renew their vehicles with greener new ones, because he says that's ""the quickest way to address air quality concerns"". ""Manufacturers are
investing heavily in the latest low emission technology, however, it's
unrealistic to think that we can fast-track the introduction of the next
generation of clean diesel technology which takes years to develop, in just
four months. ""This budget will also do nothing to remove the oldest, most
polluting vehicles from our roads in the coming years.â Environment campaigners have been taking stock. A senior lecturer in marine biology at the University of Exeter Dr Ceri Lewis welcomed the chancellor's Blue Planet II-inspired pledge to use the tax system to tackle single-use plastics which are ending up ""in every part of the world's oceans, from the surface to the deepest part of the sea floor, and in the stomachs of every species of marine animals where we have looked for them"".

A former NHS doctor has welcomed the chancellor's announcement that an extra Â£2.8bn of funding will be put into the health service. ""What matters now is identifying where this
additional budget will be allocated. Ensuring the NHS is fit for purpose in the
long term must involve large-scale investment that will facilitate the digital

This was a budget carefully crafted and designed to
show a compassionate government - when ultimately the Chancellor didn't have an
awful lot to give, says Roger Bootle of Capital Economics. He also tells the
BBC's Mike Johnson that the funds for Brexit preparations could be used to employ more customs officers and processing British goods moving across the continent. This video can not be played What will the funds earmarked for Brexit preparations be used for? As we reported earlier, the Mayor of London Sadiq Khan has been less than impressed by the Chancellor's Budget, saying that this is the ""most anti-London budget ever"". Philip Hammond pledged to spend Â£28mon mental health services, as well as to pay for a new community space and refurbishment of the Lancaster West estate in west London - where Grenfell Tower is based. Mr Khan welcomed the investment, but he felt that much more needed to be done apart from that. ""The government needs to do much more to help rehouse those families affected by the tragic fire and that should be done immediately,"" he told the BBC. ""The government must also support councils to help retrofit building with sprinklers as they can't afford to do that without national funding. ""It's crucial they get on and do this quickly to ensure every tower block in London is safe."" Tudor Aw, head of the UK tech sector at KPMG,
says that while it is good that the government is investing Â£500m into emerging technologies like AI and 5G in the Budget, it is important not to forget about existing core technologies that power the UK tech industry. ""In particular, the
UK has strengths in âold-schoolâ tech sub-sectors such as software, IT services
and semi-conductor technology,"" he said. ""Tech investment should therefore be made
in education, regulation, tax and other incentives to ensure our strength in
the tech sector is broad based and not just those areas that sit at the top of
the latest hype curve.â Simon JackBBC Business Editor Businesses don't like budgets much. They see the tinkering by the chancellor as a potential administrative burden as they adjust to new rules, thresholds and initiatives. On that basis they will have been pleased at what the chancellor didn't do. He didn't lower the turnover threshold at which small businesses must register for VAT; it remains at Â£85,000. And white van men and women around the country will appreciate the continuation of the fuel duty freeze on diesel as well as petrol, with the rise in vehicle duty limited to diesel cars only.

Phillipson, founder of student and graduate networkHelloGrads,external, says that the Budget is ignoring younger adults. âAbolishing
stamp duty for first time buyers is a head-turner. If it had been coupled with
measures to protect those in the private rental sector from soaring
rents and a lack of regulation, it might have been a more
millennial-friendly budget,"" she said. âInstead
we have a housebuilding plan, and those facing an unaffordable and largely
unregulated rental market are sidelined. âTo
court millennials, the Government needed to go far beyond token gestures like
an age extension to the 16-25 railcard. ""Gimmicks like this are an insult to a
generation thatâs facing a housing crisis, wages outstripped by inflation, and
not enough graduate jobs to go round for those leaving university and
shouldering a massive student debt.â Here's a reminder of what the Chancellor announced today... Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Multiyork will honour all existing orders placed until 22 November and customers will be contacted by the retailer. Stamp duty will be abolished immediately for first-time buyers buying a home of up to Â£300,000, Chancellor Philip Hammond has said. For properties costing up to Â£500,000, no stamp duty will be paid on the first Â£300,000. The change will apply in England and Northern Ireland.

The government wants autonomous cars on UK roads by 2021, but how can we ensure they're safe? Disposable incomes are set to be Â£540 lower by 2023 than forecast in March and pay rates will not return to levels seen before the financial crash until the middle of the next decade, according to the Resolution Foundation. The living standards think tank said annual pay was forecast to be Â£1,000 lower and consequently the UK faced a 17-year downturn before wages returned to 2008 levels. The think tank warned that Philip Hammond has not taken sufficient action to ease the living standards squeeze, with welfare cuts over the coming years set to heap pressure on low-income families. Resolution Foundation director Torsten Bell said: ""The chancellor has been handed a massive downgrade to expectations for how fast Britain's economy can grow, knocking a full quarter off the growth we can expect over the next five years. While the result for the public finances is grim, the chancellor has chosen to take the extra borrowing on the chin and indeed to borrow more, including welcome new action on housing."" He added: ""The chancellor has made the wrong call to press ahead with a damaging freeze on benefits. Welcome moves to reduce the waiting time for Universal Credit are also not matched by dealing with the much bigger challenge of planned cuts to the new benefit.""

Mladic has denied all the charges and his lawyer said he would appeal. Profile: The ""Butcher of Bosnia"" What is the case against Mladic? Mladic was the military commander of Bosnian Serb forces against Bosnian Croat and Bosniak armies. He had been on trial at the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) since 2012. It found that Mladic ""significantly contributed"" to the genocide in Srebrenica in 1995, where more than 7,000 Bosniak men and boys were murdered, the worst atrocity in Europe since World War Two. He was cleared of a second count of genocide in other municipalities. The other charges included war crimes and crimes against humanity. This video can not be played ""The soil here is soaked with blood"" - survivor Mevludin Oric Presiding judge Alphons Orie read out many crimes committed by troops under Mladic's command, including: Mass rapes of Bosniak  women and girls Keeping Bosniak prisoners in appalling conditions - starving, thirsty and sick - and beating them Terrorising civilians in Sarajevo by shelling and sniping at them Deporting Bosniaks forcibly en masse Destroying Bosniaks' homes and mosques At the end of the war in 1995 Mladic went into hiding and lived in obscurity in Serbia, protected by family and elements of the security forces. He was finally tracked down and arrested at a cousin's house in rural northern Serbia in 2011 after 16 years on the run. Mladic's days in the Scheveningen prison in The Hague have been taken up with playing chess, reading history books, watching TV and exercise. His usual chess rival is former Bosnian Serb President Radovan Karadzic, who was alsoconvicted of genocide and war crimes in the Bosnian warin 2016. Victims and their relatives watched the verdict in a memorial centre near Srebrenica, and erupted in cheers as it was read out.

"The chancellor is known by some around Westminster as ""box office Phil"", an ironic nickname for a politician who favours caution and prudence over showmanship and headline-grabbing pyrotechnics. So this should be Philip Hammond's sort ofBudget. The government is sticking with its aim of plugging the deficit and balancing the books. Although borrowing has fallen to its lowest level in a decade,the expected slowdown in productivity growthis likely to push future borrowing numbers back up, shrinking Mr Hammond's room to spend. Add in the economic uncertainty around Brexit, and Mr Hammond might be tempted to play safe and avoid any drama. There are political reasons for caution too. The Tories have a precarious working majority in the Commons with the help of the DUP, which means any remotely controversial votes on tax rises or spending cuts could easily be lost. Budget 2017: Everything you need to know Chancellor defends employment record Hammond: UK needs to get on with Brexit Who is the real Philip Hammond? Mr Hammond has already been burned from fumbling a Budget measure, whenhe had to scrap plans to raise National Insurance contributions for the self-employed within a week of announcing the policyin March. The chancellor does not revel in the political chess games enjoyed by his predecessor, George Osborne, who delighted in trying to outfox his opponents with a mischievous surprise. Not always successfully. Philip Hammond definitely does not need his own ""omnishambles"" Budget this week, and nor does the government. Badly wounded by the botched general election in June, hit by the departure of two cabinet ministers in a month, divided on Brexit, for the Tories this is a Budget that must not backfire. Laura Kuenssberg: Reshuffle maintains cabinet's Brexit balance Ironically, it was June's election that kept Philip Hammond in his job. There has been evidence of real tensions between the prime minister and her chancellor Hardly allowed out in public during the campaign, he was widely expected to be chopped after the expected victory - an impression Theresa May did nothing to dispel at a joint press conference with her chancellor in May. Tensions between Number 10 and Number 11 were clear and the source of the agro was of course Brexit. A supporter of Remain during the referendum, Mr Hammond has found himself battling the Brexiteers in the cabinet. He wants a two-year post-Brexit transition deal agreed with the EU as soon as possible to stop businesses moving out. He is resisting calls to set aside billions of pounds now for a no-deal scenario. Mr Hammond wants to protect financial services as much as possible. In October,the former Tory Chancellor Lord Lawson accused Mr Hammond of acting in a way that was ""close to sabotage"", because of his Brexit negativity, and urged Theresa May to sack him. But the prime minister, an Oxford university contemporary of her chancellor, shows no sign of wanting to move him. Former Chancellors can also be dangerous to a prime minister. Theresa May might recall the resignation speech of Geoffrey Howe in 1990 after he quit as Deputy Prime Minister, following a political career spent at the Treasury and the Foreign Office. This video can not be played Watch extracts of Geoffrey Howe's 1990 resignation speech, widely considered pivotal in Margaret Thatcher's downfall If you haven't seen it, his quietly deadly resignation speech is worth a few minutes of your time. So considering the constraints, what are Tory MPs hoping for from Wednesday's budget? ""Nobody is expecting much,"" one veteran of the Conservative back benches told me. While no fan of Philip Hammond, ""we don't want a bloodbath"", they said. ""We don't want him to screw it up,"" said another senior Tory, who is hoping for a sunnier message from the sometimes doleful Chancellor. The Tory MP Nigel Evans also says he wants a bit of cheer from Mr Hammond. ""If he comes to the despatch box and starts hand-wringing, and saying, 'We've got no money,' but at the same time we know they are prepared to up the amount of money they don't necessarily have to give the EU, then we'll all think, 'What the heck's going on?'"" The consistent view among Leave-supporting Tories is that they want him to sound upbeat about the possibilities of Brexit. But the chancellor has strong admirers on the Tory benches too, relieved he is in the Treasury's driving seat while the government argues about the final destination of Brexit. Shadow chancellor John McDonnell has demanded ""an emergency Budget for our public services"", which he says are in crisis The MP for Chelmsford, Vicky Ford, is a fan. ""I want a chancellor who's as boring as anything, but really understands the numbers and the finances. I think Philip Hammond's been doing an incredibly good, detailed analysis and that's exactly what we need at this time."" Tory MPs agree it is a very difficult Budget for Philip Hammond to pitch. It needs to try to prove the government has a purpose other than Brexit, while having very little cash to splash. Maybe the chancellor will surprise us. The former schoolboy disco entrepreneur turned wealthy businessman took career risks long before he entered politics. But Wednesday will be one of his toughest challenges yet.

"John Lasseter, the head of animation at Pixar and Disney, is taking a leave of absence after allegations of misconduct emerged about him. Current and former staff told The Hollywood Reporter that Mr Lasseter frequently gave unwanted hugs and invaded personal space. Other sources alleged he was known for ""grabbing, kissing, making comments"". In a statement Mr Lasseter apologised ""to anyone who has ever been on the receiving end of an unwanted hug"". He apologised for his ""missteps"" and ""any other gesture they felt crossed the line in any way, shape, or form"". ""Collectively, you mean the world to me, and I deeply apologise if I have let you down,"" he said. ""No matter how benign my intent, everyone has the right to set their own boundaries and have them respected."" The entertainment titan is credited on a vast array of animated features - including Inside Out Mr Lasseter, a founding member of Pixar, said he would be taking a six-month leave of absence to ""start taking better care of myself"". The chief creative officer at both Pixar and Walt Disney animation studios, he is one of the driving forces in the industry and has been behind some of the most successful children's films in the last two decades. He was the director of Toy Story, A Bug's Life, and Cars; and has producer credits on dozens of major films including Finding Nemo, Wall-E, Up, and Frozen. Disney, in a statement quoted by Reuters news agency, said it appreciated his ""candor and sincere apology"" and supported his decision to take a leave of absence. Pixar's latest movie, Coco - on which Mr Lasseter is credited as an executive producer - releases on 22 November in the United States, hours after his leave of absence was announced. The fantasy adventure film is scheduled for release in UK theatres in January. Mr Lasseter is the creative lead at both Disney and Pixar animation studios The claims against Lasseter come after Pixar screenwriter Rashida Jones left the production of Toy Story 4. Jonestold the New York Times,externalher departure was due the studio's poor treatment of women and BAME staff. She also rebuffedmedia stories,externalthat the real reason for her stepping away was due directly to Lasseter's behaviour towards her. Her writing partner Will McCormack left along with her. In a joint statement to the NYT they said it was ""untrue"" they had left because of ""unwanted advances"". ""There is so much talent at Pixar, and we remain enormous fans of their films,"" they added. ""However, it is also a culture where women and people of colour do not have an equal creative voice.""

"YouTuber Jack Maynard has left I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here! due to ""circumstances outside camp"". His exit comes after a series of his tweets - in which he used inappropriate language - were publishedin the Sun newspaper,externalwhile he was in Australia. His publicist confirmed he was leaving the ITV show so he could be made aware of any allegations against him and have the right to defend himself. They said he agreed with the decision ""made by his representatives and ITV"". A spokesperson for the show said: ""Due to circumstances outside camp Jack has had to withdraw from the show."" The 22-year-old is one of 10 contestants taking part in the programme, which started on Sunday. Jack Maynard 'ashamed' of tweets Maynard appeared on Tuesday night's show but presenters Ant and Dec confirmed his removal half-way through the programme, telling viewers they could not vote for him in Wednesday's bushtucker trial. A statement from his publicist said: ""In the last few days Jack Maynard has been the subject of a succession of media stories which, given his position as a contestant on I'm a Celebrity Get Me Out Of Here! - filmed in the Australian jungle, with no contact with the outside world, he has been unable to respond to. ""Since it is only fair that everyone should be aware of any allegations made against them and should also have the right to defend themselves, it was agreed that it would be better to bring him out of the show."" The 22-year-old has more than 1.2m subscribers to his YouTube channel and is the younger brother of singer Conor Maynard.

"This video can not be played Zimbabwe's day of celebration Jubilant Zimbabweans have celebrated late into the night after Robert Mugabe resigned as president. He held power for 37 years and once said ""only God"" could remove him. His ally turned rival, former Vice-President Emmerson Mnangagwa, is expected to return from neighbouring South Africa and could be appointed as the new president within hours. Mr Mugabe's shock resignation came in the form of a letter read out by the speaker of parliament. Robert Mugabe: Hero or villain? Mugabe's long career in pictures How Zimbabwe is celebrating In it, Mr Mugabe - who had so far resisted pressure from the public, the army and his own party to step aside - said he was resigning to allow a smooth and peaceful transfer of power, and that his decision was voluntary. The announcement abruptly halted an impeachment hearing that had begun against him on Tuesday. Lawmakers from the ruling party and opposition roared with glee, and spontaneous scenes of joy erupted in the streets with people dancing, singing, honking car horns and waving flags. ""I'm so happy, wonderful, feeling so much excited, this is the greatest moment for our country,"" Julian Mtukudzi told the AFP news agency. ""We have been having sleepless nights hoping and waiting and we are so happy. It's over and it's done.""

""We are tired of this man, we are so glad he's gone. We don't want him anymore and yes, today, it's victory,"" she said. The ruling Zanu-PF party says former Vice-President Emmerson Mnangagwa will succeed Mr Mugabe. Mr Mnangagwa's sacking earlier this month triggered a political crisis. It had been seen by many as an attempt to clear the way for Grace Mugabe to succeed her husband as leader and riled the military leadership, who stepped in and put Mr Mugabe under house arrest. Emmerson Mnangagwa: The 'crocodile' who snapped back The polarising Grace Mugabe Mr Mugabe, 93, was until his resignation the world's oldest leader. According to the constitution his successor should be the current Vice-President, Phelekezela Mphoko, a supporter of Grace Mugabe. But a ZANU-PF official Larry Mavhima told Reuters Mr Mnangagwa is to return home for 11:30 GMT, where he is later expected to be sworn-in. Fergal Keane, BBC Africa editor, Harare Driving through Harare, the cheers and the blaring of car horns signalled the end of the Mugabe era. The man who dominated Zimbabwe for so long has already begun to fade into history here. It is a city singing with the noise of joy. Exactly a week after the military first moved against President Mugabe, I was standing in parliament as legislators debated the motion to impeach him. Suddenly, there was cheering. An usher approached the speaker and handed him a letter. He stood to speak and we strained to hear his words. They were muffled but momentous. Robert Mugabe had resigned. On the floor of the parliament I met jubilant MPs. Some danced. Celebrations spilled into the hallways and out into the street. Despite welcoming the news, Zimbabwean opposition and civil society figures have warned that the political culture needs to change. Opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai told the BBC he hoped that Zimbabwe was on a ""new trajectory"" that would include free and fair elections. He said Mr Mugabe should be allowed to ""go and rest for his last days"".

"This video can not be played Emmerson Mnangagwa addresses supporters in Harare Zimbabwe's incoming leader Emmerson Mnangagwa has hailed a ""new and unfolding democracy"" after returning from exile to replace Robert Mugabe. He also vowed to create jobs in a country where some estimates say 90% of people are unemployed. ""We want to grow our economy, we want peace, we want jobs, jobs, jobs,"" he told a cheering crowd in Harare. Mr Mnangagwa, who fled to South Africa two weeks ago, is to be made the new president on Friday, state TV said. His dismissal led the ruling party and the military to intervene and force an end to Mr Mugabe's 37-year long rule. Mugabe has gone, but will Zimbabwe change? Five things Zimbabwe's economy urgently needs Mugabe's downfall: The unanswered questions He told supporters at the headquarters of the ruling Zanu-PF party that he had been the subject of several assassination plots and thanked the army for running the ""process"" of removing Mr Mugabe peacefully. This video can not be played How news of Robert Mugabe's resignation was greeted across Zimbabwe The news that 93-year-old Mr Mugabe was stepping down sparked wild celebrations across the country late into Tuesday night. It came in the form of a letter read out in parliament on Tuesday, abruptly halting impeachment proceedings against him. In it, Mr Mugabe said he was resigning to allow a smooth and peaceful transfer of power, and that his decision was voluntary. Zanu-PF purges itself to win back Zimbabweans' trust Emmerson Mnangagwa: The 'crocodile' who snapped back A spokesman for the ruling Zanu-PF party said Mr Mnangagwa, 71, would serve the remainder of Mr Mugabe's term until elections that are due to be held by September 2018. Nicknamed the ""crocodile"" because of his political cunning, Mr Mnangagwa met South African President Jacob Zuma before leaving for Zimbabwe. BBC's Shingai Nyoka in Harare Thousands of party supporters waited for hours to welcome Mr Mnangagwa in his first public appearance since he emerged from hiding. During his 20-minute speech, he corrected himself at least once for referring to Mr Mugabe as president rather than former president. His message was largely conciliatory. But he also relished his stunning return to power and successful removal of Mr Mugabe. He brought up Grace Mugabe's speech a fortnight ago, in which - meaning him - she said we must ""deal with the snake by crushing its head"". A day later he was fired. ""I wonder which snake's head was crushed?"" he said to loud cheers. Mr Mnangagwa's firing by Mr Mugabe two weeks ago triggered an unprecedented political crisis in the country. It had been seen by many as an attempt to clear the way for Grace Mugabe to succeed her husband as leader and riled the military leadership, which stepped in and put Mr Mugabe under house arrest. Mugabe's long career in pictures The polarising Grace Mugabe Robert Mugabe: Hero or villain? Under the constitution, the role of successor would normally go to a serving vice-president, and one still remains in post - Phelekezela Mphoko. However, Mr Mphoko - a key ally of Mrs Mugabe - has just been fired by Zanu-PF and is not believed to be in the country. In his absence, the party has nominated Mr Mnangagwa, the speaker of parliament confirmed. Some have questioned whether the handover to Mr Mnangagwa will bring about real change in the country. He was national security chief at a time when thousands of civilians died in post-independence conflict in the 1980s, though he denies having blood on his hands.

"The Law Society misled the public over the expertise of solicitors in a scheme set up to help property buyers and sellers in England and Wales, the advertising watchdog has ruled. Its website had said firms covered by the Conveyancing Quality Scheme had taken rigorous examination and tests. But the Advertising Standards Authority found they could be accepted before staff had been trained and assessed. The professional body said there had been no intention to mislead. TheLaw Society,externalrepresents 170,000 solicitors in England and Wales. The purpose of the Conveyancing Quality Scheme (CQS), the society said, was ""to provide a trusted community of solicitors within the residential conveyancing market that helped to deter fraud and improve 'best practice' standards"". Set up in 2011, it was said by the society to be a ""recognised quality standard"" for residential conveyancing practices. A page on its website in November 2016 claimed all members of CQS had demonstrated they have a high level of knowledge, skills, experience and practice. But a solicitor, who was familiar with the requirements of joining the scheme, challenged the description. The complaint was initially rejected by the ASA in June but it has now reversed its decision. The CQS scheme was designed to help the buyers and sellers of property In itsruling,external, the ASA said the advert had been unsubstantiated and misleading. The ASA said from the description, consumers would understand the Law Society had conducted an in-depth assessment of each firm that applied for the scheme and ""would expect that all criteria would have been met prior to accreditation being granted"". However, the ASA said it had found all but two of the 293 firms who applied for the scheme were accepted - in some cases, before relevant staff had been properly trained. It said: ""While we acknowledged that firms were granted CQS accreditation on the basis of independently-verified information attesting that they met an adequate standard... the ad exaggerated the level of knowledge, skills and experience possessed... and the extent of the checks that a firm had to undergo to receive its accreditation."" The BBC's legal correspondent Clive Coleman said the ruling was ""highly embarrassing"" for the Law Society, which has complied with the order to remove the offending words.

"John Lasseter, the head of animation at Pixar and Disney, is taking a leave of absence after allegations of misconduct emerged about him. Current and former staff told The Hollywood Reporter that Mr Lasseter frequently gave unwanted hugs and invaded personal space. Other sources alleged he was known for ""grabbing, kissing, making comments"". In a statement Mr Lasseter apologised ""to anyone who has ever been on the receiving end of an unwanted hug"". He apologised for his ""missteps"" and ""any other gesture they felt crossed the line in any way, shape, or form"". ""Collectively, you mean the world to me, and I deeply apologise if I have let you down,"" he said. ""No matter how benign my intent, everyone has the right to set their own boundaries and have them respected."" The entertainment titan is credited on a vast array of animated features - including Inside Out Mr Lasseter, a founding member of Pixar, said he would be taking a six-month leave of absence to ""start taking better care of myself"". The chief creative officer at both Pixar and Walt Disney animation studios, he is one of the driving forces in the industry and has been behind some of the most successful children's films in the last two decades. He was the director of Toy Story, A Bug's Life, and Cars; and has producer credits on dozens of major films including Finding Nemo, Wall-E, Up, and Frozen. Disney, in a statement quoted by Reuters news agency, said it appreciated his ""candor and sincere apology"" and supported his decision to take a leave of absence.

"Norberto RodrÃ­guez, uncle of missing submariner Luis, waits for news Argentina's navy says it is worried about oxygen levels inside the submarine that went missing last Wednesday in the southern Atlantic. Forty-four people are on board the ARA San Juan, which vanished after it reported an electric breakdown. A navy spokesman, Enrique Balbi, said a massive search operation would continue until the vessel was located. Better weather conditions on Tuesday, after days of rough sea, have given new hope to relatives of the missing crew. But Mr Balbi cautioned: ""We are considering all possibilities and obviously the most critical situation would be the fact that we are on the sixth day of oxygen."" The search effort has now been narrowed down to an area of 20km by 20km (12 miles), he added. On Monday, navy officials said that noises picked up by two search vessels did not come from the sub, the second false alarm to hit the search. The ARA San Juan was returning from a routine mission to Ushuaia, near the southern-most tip of South America, when it reported an ""electrical breakdown"". According to naval commander Gabriel Galeazzi, the submarine surfaced and reported the breakdown, which Capt Galeazzi described as a ""short circuit"" in the sub's batteries. The sub was ordered to cut its mission short and return to the naval base in Mar del Plata immediately. According to navy spokesman Enrique Balbi, the captain of the ARA San Juan contacted the naval base once more after reporting the problem. In the message, he reportedly said that the problem had been adequately fixed and that the sub would submerge and proceed towards Mar del Plata naval base. The last contact was made at 07:30 local time (10:30 GMT) on Wednesday 15 November. It is not known what happened to the sub after that contact. Read:What happens when a submarine vanishes Argentine navy protocol stipulates that in peace time, submarines make contact twice a day with the base. When the submarine failed to call in, the Argentine navy began its search for the vessel. Navy commander Carlos Zavalla at that point spoke only of a ""failure to communicate"" and urged relatives of the crew to remain calm. There was no mention by navy officials of the vessel having any problems at the time and rumours of a fire on board were dismissed by the navy's spokesman, Enrique Balbi. On Sunday, relatives of some of the crew said that they had been told in messages sent before contact with the submarine was lost, that there was a problem with the sub's batteries. Naval commander Gabriel Galeazzi told journalists about the mechanical problems on Monday On Monday, naval commander Gabriel Galeazzi confirmed the sub's captain had reported a breakdown on Wednesday describing it as a ""short-circuit"" in the sub's battery system. Capt Galeazzi said that mechanical problems were not uncommon and rarely posed a risk. ""A warship has a lot of backup systems, to allow it to move from one to another when there is a breakdown,"" he said. He also said that the sub had not sent a distress signal to the navy base. There are 44 crew on board the submarine, which is under the command of Pedro MartÃ­n FernÃ¡ndez. Forty-three of the crew are men but there is also one woman, Eliana MarÃ­a Krawczyk. The 35-year-old is the first female officer in Argentina to serve on a submarine. Her family says it was Eliana MarÃ­a Krawczyk's dream to become a submariner Nicknamed ""the queen of the sea"" by her father she comes from OberÃ¡, a city in northern Argentina. Despite having been born and raised far inland, her relatives say that ""she was born to be a submariner"", citing her ""will of steel"" and a passion for her job. The rest of the crew is made up of submariners of varying ages and experience. The sub's engineer, HernÃ¡n RodrÃ­guez, has been on the ARA San Juan for 11 years, local media reported. Submarines are built to be difficult to find and the search has been further hindered by bad weather. The Argentine Navy tweeted a video showing the rough conditions at sea. Allow Twitter content?

Waves of up to six metres in height (19.6ft) have made it difficult for search vessels and planes to spot anything on the sea's surface. Brazil, Chile, Colombia, France, Germany, Peru, South Africa, Uruguay and the UK have all sent either ships or planes to help with the search. The US Navy has deployed two underwater vehicles which use sonar to create images of the sea floor. A Nasa research aircraft has also flown over the search area but failed to spot anything. Despite the failure to find any trace of the sub, the father of one of the crew said relatives remained optimistic. ""In general there's a positive outlook, with the hope that there can be some way of finding them,"" Jorge Villareal said.

"The leaks were released prior to the broadcast of Game of Thrones series seven US prosecutors have charged an Iranian man with hacking into HBO, leaking Game of Thrones scripts and demanding a $6m (Â£4.5m) ransom. Behzad Mesri is accused of computer fraud, wire fraud, extortion and identity theft. Acting US attorney Joon Kim told a news conference in New York that Mr Mesri was in Iran. He said that even though US authorities could not arrest him immediately, Mr Mesri would face consequences. ""He will never be able to travel outside of Iran without fear of being arrested and brought here,"" Mr Kim said. Prosecutors allege Mr Mesri,who has been added to the FBI's most wanted list,,externalhad worked for Iran's military and been involved in a campaign to deface US websites. Mr Kim said he was an ""experienced and sophisticated hacker who has been wreaking havoc on computer systems around the world for some time"". Prosecutors say Mr Mesri began conducting online reconnaissance of HBO's computer networks and employees in May 2017. The FBI released a grainy photograph of Iranian national Behzad Mesri ""Over the next couple of months, he successfully compromised multiple user accounts in order to obtain access to the media giant's servers,"" court documents say. ""Through the course of the intrusions into HBO's systems, Mr Mesri was responsible for stealing confidential and proprietary data including... scripts and plot summaries for unaired programming, including but not limited to episodes of Game of Thrones."" A few weeks later, the documents allege, Mr Mesri claimed to have stolen about 1.5TB of data and began an extortion campaign that included an email to HBO employees that read: ""Hi to All losers"" Yes it's true! HBO is hacked!"" It is unclear whether any ransom money, demanded in Bitcoin according to the court documents, was ever paid. Mr Mesri has not yet commented on the charges.

"This video can not be played MPs cheered and celebrated as the resignation was announced Zimbabwe's President Robert Mugabe has resigned, bringing an end to 37 years of rule and sparking jubilant celebrations in the nation's streets. A letter from Mr Mugabe read out by the speaker of parliament said the decision was voluntary and he had made it to allow a smooth transfer of power. The news abruptly halted an impeachment hearing that had begun against him. The ruling Zanu-PF party says former vice-president Emmerson Mnangagwa will succeed Mr Mugabe, in power since 1980. Mr Mnangagwa's sacking earlier this month triggered a political crisis. It had been seen by many as an attempt to clear the way for Grace Mugabe to succeed her husband as leader and riled the military leadership, who stepped in and put Mr Mugabe under house arrest. After the resignation announcement, lawmakers roared in jubilation. Robert Mugabe: Hero or villain? Resignation and reaction - as it happened Mr Mugabe, 93, was until his resignation the world's oldest leader. He had previously refused to quit despite last week's military takeover and days of protests. This video can not be played Scenes of jubilation on the streets of the capital According to the constitution his successor should be the current vice-president, Phelekezela Mphoko, a supporter of Grace Mugabe. But Zanu-PF chief whip Lovemore Matuke told Reuters news agency that Mr Mnangagwa would be in office ""within 48 hours"". Emmerson Mnangagwa: The 'crocodile' who snapped back Speaking from an undisclosed location earlier on Tuesday, Mr Mnangagwa said he had fled abroad two weeks ago when he learned of a plot to kill him. Fergal Keane, BBC Africa editor, Harare Driving through Harare, the cheers and the blaring of car horns signalled the end of the Mugabe era. The man who dominated Zimbabwe for so long has already begun to fade into history here. It is a city singing with the noise of joy. Exactly a week after the military first moved against President Mugabe, I was standing in parliament as legislators debated the motion to impeach him. Suddenly, there was cheering. An usher approached the speaker and handed him a letter. He stood to speak and we strained to hear his words. They were muffled but momentous. Robert Mugabe had resigned. On the floor of the parliament I met jubilant MPs. Some danced. Celebrations spilled into the hallways and out into the street. A people who endured white minority rule and then saw their independence become tyranny found themselves suddenly free. UK Prime Minister Theresa May said Mr Mugabe's resignation ""provides Zimbabwe with an opportunity to forge a new path free of the oppression that characterised his rule"". She said that former colonial power Britain, ""as Zimbabwe's oldest friend"", will do all it can to support free and fair elections and the rebuilding of the Zimbabwean economy. Opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai told the BBC he hoped that Zimbabwe was on a ""new trajectory"" that would include free and fair elections. He said Mr Mugabe should be allowed to ""go and rest for his last days"". In other reaction: The US Embassy in Harare, the capital, said it was a ""historic moment"" and congratulated Zimbabweans who ""raised their voices and stated peacefully and clearly that the time for change was overdue"" South Africa's main opposition Democratic Alliance welcomed the move, saying Mr Mugabe had turned from ""liberator to dictator"" Prominent Zimbabwean opposition politician David Coltart tweeted: ""We have removed a tyrant but not yet a tyranny"" Civil society group the Platform for Concerned Citizens called for dialogue between all political parties, which it said should lead to the formation of a national transitional authority Robert Mugabe won elections during his 37 years in power, but over the past 15 years these were marred by violence against political opponents. How Zimbabwe is celebrating Mugabe's long career in pictures How UK-Zimbabwe relations went sour He presided over a deepening economic crisis in Zimbabwe, where people are on average 15% poorer now than they were in 1980. This video can not be played Activist and political candidate Vimbaishe Musvaburi breaks down in tears of joy However, Mr Mugabe was not forced out after decades in power by a popular mass movement but rather as a result of political splits within his Zanu-PF party. The leader of the influential liberation war veterans - former allies of Mr Mugabe - said after the army takeover that Mr Mugabe was a ""dictator"", who ""as he became old, surrendered his court to a gang of thieves around his wife"". Both he and Grace, 52, are believed to be at a mansion in Harare. The polarising Grace Mugabe Zimbabwe in 10 numbers Mr Mugabe's decision to finally resign sparked joy in the streets.

""I am the happiest person under the sun right now, because I always believed that Mugabe was going to step down in my lifetime and it has happened,"" human rights activist Linda Masarira told the BBC. ""And now going forward it's time for the opposition to reorganise and ensure that we will have a government that cares for the people. And everyone has to be included.""

"North Korea continues to test ballistic missiles and nuclear weapons in breach of UN resolutions The US has unveiled fresh sanctions against North Korea which it says are designed to stop its funding of nuclear and ballistic missile programmes. The measures target North Korean shipping operations and Chinese companies that trade with Pyongyang. It comes a day afterUS President Donald Trump redesignated North Korea as a state sponsor of terrorism. The North is already subject to a raft of sanctions from the US, the UN and the EU. The US has been imposing sanctions on Pyongyang since 2008, freezing the assets of individuals and companies linked to its nuclear programme and banning the exports of goods and services to the country. ""As North Korea continues to threaten international peace and security, we are steadfast in our determination to maximise economic pressure to isolate it from outside sources of trade and revenue while exposing its evasive tactics,""said Treasury Secretary Steven T Mnuchin on Tuesday,external. ""These designations include companies that have engaged in trade with North Korea cumulatively worth hundreds of millions of dollars. We are also sanctioning the shipping and transportation companies, and their vessels, that facilitate North Korea's trade and its deceptive manoeuvres."" This video can not be played Trump: ""N Korea supported acts of international terrorism"" Three Chinese companies accused of trading with North Korea - Dandong Kehua Economy and Trade, Dandong Xianghe Trading and Dandong Hongda Trade - are added to the US Treasury's sanctions list. Also targeted is the Korea South-South Co-operation Corporation which is alleged to have created revenue for the North by sending workers to countries including Russia, Poland, Cambodia and China. In September, the US proposed a range of United Nations sanctions against North Korea, including an oil ban and a freeze on leader Kim Jong-un's assets. It followed the North's sixth nuclear test and repeated missile launches.

"This video can not be played Do you know how alcohol changes your mood? Different types of alcoholic drink change and shape your mood in different ways, says a study into drinking and emotions. Spirits may make you feel angry, sexy or tearful, while red wine or beer may make you feel relaxed, say researchers. They questioned nearly 30,000 people aged 18-34 from 21 different countries for the study in the journalBMJ Open,external. All the respondents drank beer, wine and spirits, and many said each type of alcohol had a different effect on them. While having a few drinks can be enjoyable, researchers hope their findings will help highlight the dangers of dependent drinking. People build up tolerance to alcohol over time and can end up drinking more to feel the same ""positive"" effects that they enjoy. But they also risk getting negative ones too, says researcher Prof Mark Bellis from Public Health Wales NHS Trust. The anonymous online survey, which recruited respondents via newspaper and magazine adverts and social media, found: Red wine appeared to make people more lethargic than white wine Respondents were most likely to report feeling relaxed when drinking red wine or beer More than 40% said drinking spirits made them feel sexy Over half said drinking spirits also gave them energy and confidence But around a third said they felt aggressive when drinking spirits Drinking spirits was more likely than all other drink types to be associated with feelings of aggression, illness, restlessness and tearfulness Men were significantly more likely than women to associate feelings of aggression with all types of alcohol, particularly heavier drinkers However, the findings show only an association and do not explain the reasons for changes. Prof Bellis said the setting in which the alcohol was consumed was an important factor that the study tried to take into consideration by asking about drinking at home and outside of the home. ""Young people will often drink spirits on a night out, whereas wine might be drunk more at home, with a meal. ""There will be an element of expectation too. Someone who wants to relax might choose to have a beer or a glass of wine."" He said the way different drinks are marketed and promoted might encourage people to select certain drinks to suit different moods, but that this could backfire if it triggered negative emotions. ""People may rely on alcohol to help them feel a certain way. People might drink to feel more confident or relaxed but they also risk other negative emotional responses too."" Prof Bellis and his colleagues at King's College London said the findings suggested that dependent drinkers might rely on alcohol to generate the positive emotions they associated with drinking - they were five times more likely to feel energised than low-risk drinkers. He also said the study revealed a difference between men and women's emotional relationship with different alcoholic drinks. ""We got stronger emotional relationships with women across pretty well every type of emotion, except for aggression."" Aggression, he said, was more likely to be felt among men. Dr John Larsen, from Drinkaware, said: ""This study highlights the importance of understanding why people choose to drink certain alcoholic drinks and what effect they expect these drinks will have on them. ""The UK chief medical officers' guideline for both men and women states that in order to keep health risks from alcohol to a low level it is safest not to be drinking more than 14 units a week on a regular basis."" That equates to 12 single measures of spirits, six pints of beer or six 175ml glasses of wine a week. Experts say setting a minimum unit price of 50 pence per unit would help cut alcohol-related deaths. A minimum price policy will come into force on 1 May 2018 in Scotland. Legislation to establish a minimum price is currently under active consideration by the Welsh Government and by the Irish Senate. There are no plans yet to do the same in England, although the Home Office says the policy is under review.

The show spawned several hit songs, such as I Think I Love You. Following the sitcom he enjoyed a hugely successful career in music and acting. He received Grammy nominations and sold more than 30 million records worldwide. At the peak of his fame in the 1970s, his fan club reportedly had a bigger membership than that of The Beatles and Elvis Presley combined.

"Ikea has re-launched a recall of millions of chests and dressers in the US and Canada following the death of an eighth child. It saiditems in its Malm range and other chests and dressers,externalpose a ""serious tip-over and entrapment hazard"" if not secured to a wall, Ikea first recalled the furniture in 2016 after four children had died. It has no plans for a UK recall, stating that the chest of drawers ""meet all mandatory stability requirements"". Josef Dudek, a 2-year-old boy in California, died when he became trapped beneath a three-drawer Malm chest after he had been put down for a nap by his father. Since 2011, four other young children have been killed in connection with the Malm range. A further three children have died as a result of other Ikea chests and dressers tipping over, with the earliest death occurring in 1989. Jozef Dudek died after an Ikea Malm dresser toppled over onto him Widespread criticism spurred the companyto add China to the recall last year. However, it has not made announcements in other countries, including the UK. Ikea said it meets ""mandatory stability standards"" in all markets and that the products remain safe if secured to a wall, as recommended. It has a ""Secure It!"" campaignto raise awareness of the issue,external. A spokeswoman for Ikea said it was not aware of any tip-over fatalities outside the US and has no plans to expand the recall. She said: ""Our priority is and has always been to ensure that our products are safe to use. That means securing the chest of drawers to the wall according to the assembly instructions, using the tip-over restraint provided with the product. ""We don't believe a global recall from IKEA would be the solution. Instead, we are convinced that we can make a difference by raising awareness among consumers of the tip-over risks and how to prevent them through the global Secure it! campaign."" The re-launched recall involves Ikea children's chests of drawers taller than 60 cm and adult chest of drawers taller than 75 cm, including those from the Malm line. It follows reports of more than 300 tip-over incidents in the US and Canada since 1985, resulting in eight deaths and 144 injuries to children between the ages of 19 months and 10 years old. Lawyer Alan Feldman, an attorney for the Dudek family whose son was killed in May,has said that the recall in 2016 was not effective,external. Ikea said it had done ""extensive"" outreach to customers about the recall, including an email campaign. A spokeswoman said: ""The most recent incident has indicated to us that there is more work to be done in spreading the message. However, we had to wait to confirm that the product is IKEA, which took some time."" She said Ikea said it has provided refunds or wall-anchoring help for more than one million dressers or chests since 2015, when it started offering free anchoring kits. Ikea,externalhas stopped selling the products in the US and Canada that do not meet voluntary US standards. It also reached a $50m settlement with the families of three toddlers killed previously.

"This video can not be played Robert Mugabe refused to resign and instead said: ""The congress is due... I will preside over its processes"". Zimbabwe's anticipated political transition is a complicated process with no obvious answers. Since the military took control of the country last Wednesday, difficult negotiations have been under way. They culminated in President Robert Mugabe's defiant message on Sunday night, vowing to stay put and confounding expectations that he would resign. ""I was surprised,"" says Evan Mawarire, pastor and activist behind#ThisFlag,external, a protest movement which began on social media. But in hindsight, he says the statement was an attempt to make the process democratic and constitutional. ""It would have been awkward for him to resign flanked by army generals,"" adds Pastor Mawarire. Since the military took control of Zimbabwe, they've insisted their action was not a coup - and referred to Mr Mugabe as the ""commander-in-chief"". There have also been calls from the international community to maintain constitutional order. But the transition many in Zimbabwe and abroad hope for is still an intricate process. There have been calls for the President to initiate the process himself by stepping down. But a resignation may not be the quick solution the forces behind the military take-over would have hoped for. In the event of Mr Mugabe stepping down, the country's constitution dictates that the vice-president would take over as acting president for a period of 90 days. As things stand, that would be 77-year-old Phelekezela Mphoko. President Mugabe now faces impeachment on charges that he ""allowed his wife to usurp constitutional power"" The former military commander is seen as a close ally of First Lady Grace Mugabe, a polarising figure whose ambition to succeed her husband has been blamed for the current political crisis. In recent weeks, she has been at loggerheads with former Vice-President Emmerson Mnangagwa. His sacking was viewed as a strategy to clear the way for Mrs Mugabe to ascend. But the military intervened in what was largely a fall-out within the ruling Zanu-PF, pre-empting her anticipated promotion. These intrigues leave her ally, Mr Mphoko, in an unfavourable position as the likely successor. He is in a weaker position now having been sacked from the ruling party over the weekend. In the absence of a resignation, the ruling party would seek change from within. The groundwork was laid on Sunday in an unprecedented decision by the party's central committee to fire Mr Mugabe as party leader and install Mr Mnangagwa in his place. The next stage is the removal of the president from power through parliament. The proponents of the process need a two thirds majority vote to succeed. Technically, Zanu-PF has a majority in both houses of parliament, but the test will be how many Mugabe loyalists can be convinced to vote him out. In the current environment, the party could benefit from legislators who may have been reluctant to force Mr Mugabe out, but who wouldn't want to drown as the wave of change hits the Southern African country. Things get even more knotty in parliament. Derek Matyszak, a Senior Researcher at the Institute of Security Studies, says the ruling party ""will need the support of [opposition party] Movement for Democratic Change, who will in turn want to cut a deal."" MDC leader Morgan Tsavangirai last week called President Mugabe to resign and make way for a transitional arrangement It is not clear on what conditions the MDC would support their political rivals, nor whether Zanu-PF would be willing to dangle the carrot. Senior Zanu-PF officials seem confident about their move to remove the president. ""The last thing they [Zanu-PF] would want is for it to fail,"" adds Mr Matyszak. That, he says, would embolden Mr Mugabe. Also heavily invested in the transition process are Mr Mugabe's fellow independence fighters. They have called for more protests to push him out of power. Saturday saw some of the biggest demonstrations ever witnessed in Zimbabwe. This video can not be played Jubilant protesters in Harare called for President Robert Mugabe to step down The military sanctioned this weekend's demonstrations, and was in turn praised by the crowds for ""delivering the second independence"". But it all appears choreographed to push their agenda and give the process some legitimacy for being ""people-driven"". There is no doubt a lot has changed. Pastor Mawarire had been leading the #ThisFlag protest long before the military intervention. ""If we had done two weeks ago what we did on Saturday, we'd have been arrested and charged with subversion,"" he says. He was arrested and charged in September for urging Zimbabweans to rise up and fight against the deteriorating economic situation in the country. It has taken bold and daring manoeuvres to get to this point in Zimbabwe's politics. Engaging the reverse gear now may prove costly, particularly for the architects of change. Defying a strongman was never going to be easy. President Mugabe has survived huge challenges during his 37-year rule including paralysing economic sanctions imposed by the West and bruising competition from a once vibrant opposition. In many cases, it has been at a huge cost - seen in the economy contracting and the loss of civilian lives. But the current attempts to end his rule come from his traditional support base - his own party, war veterans and the military. It is hard to imagine how he could survive for long. But in the midst of political turmoil, Zimbabwe remains calm and optimistic.

"Robert Gabriel Mugabe was educated at a mission school and went on to train as teacher, graduating from Fort Hare university where Nelson Mandela studied. In 1958, he went to work in Ghana There he met Sally Hafron whom he married in 1961. She was actually more political than him before he was recruited by black nationalists. He was later imprisoned by the Rhodesian government, but was not allowed to attend the funeral of his son After his release from jail in 1974, he came to prominence as one of the leaders of a guerrilla war against white-minority rule, along with Joshua Nkomo (left) They agreed to disarm at peace talks hosted by the British. They formed the patriotic front - and to the surprise of Western observers won elections held in February 1980 by a landslide Robert Mugabe had arrived in the country only six weeks before the election, after spending 10 years in exile. He became prime minister, forming an inclusive government During his first years in office, he was feted by leaders across the world, including Cuba's Fidel Castro, who visited the country in 1986 He also had a close relationship with UK Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher - and initially pursued a policy of reconciliation with his white former enemies, letting them keep their economic wealth He married his typist Grace Marufu, with whom he already had two children, in 1996 a few years after his first wife died. The 1990s also saw the country's intervention in the war in the Democratic Republic of Congo, which proved costly to the economy When Tony Blair's UK government pulled out of talks to fund controversial land reforms in 1997 and after Mr Mugabe lost a referendum on a new constitution three years later, pro-Mugabe militias began to invade white-owned farms It was around this time that Mr Mugabe abandoned his Savile Row and safari suits in favour of brightly coloured attire emblazoned with his face when he was on the campaign trail It became a cult of personality, and big celebrations were organised by the ruling Zanu-PF party each year to mark his birthday... These included extravagant cakes. This one reflects how many Africans regarded him as a hero, admiring his stand against white farmers However, his popularity, especially in urban areas, steadily declined at home - and he lost the first round of the presidential election in 2008, winning the run-off after the opposition MDC withdrew, citing violence Sanctions imposed by the US and EU prompted Mr Mugabe's ""Look East"" policy, turning to China for investment. He used to travel to Asia for medical treatment - his daughter Bona (C) studied in Hong Kong and Singapore His Zanu-PF party won elections in 2013, after four years of a power-sharing government, on a platform of indigenisation - a policy of ceding economic control to black Zimbabweans. Crippling cash shortages led to protests in 2016 However, the security forces always stood by Mr Mugabe - until his wife's ambition for power proved too much for them to stomach and they launched a takeover on 15 November 2017 They were anxious that it not look like a coup, and Mr Mugabe carried on with some of his duties - though his age showed as he appeared to doze during a graduation ceremony But after a mass demonstration and amid impeachment proceedings, the 93-year-old leader bowed to pressure. He resigned after 37 years in power - prompting wild celebrations. All pictures copyright Â© 2025 BBC.

"Emmerson Dambudzo Mnangagwa, the man known as ""the crocodile"" because of his political cunning, achieved a long-held ambition to succeed Robert Mugabe as Zimbabwe's president in November last year. He has now won a disputed presidential election to legitimise his rule, promising voters his efforts to woo foreign investors will bring back the economy from the brink of collapse. Mr Mugabe resigned following a military takeover and mass demonstrations - all sparked by his sacking of Mr Mnangagwa as his vice-president. ""The crocodile"", who lived up to his name and snapped back, may have unseated Zimbabwe's only ruler, but he is also associated with some of the worst atrocities committed under the ruling Zanu-PF party since independence in 1980. One veteran of the liberation struggle, who worked with him for many years, once put it simply: ""He's a very cruel man, very cruel."" But his children see him as a principled, if unemotional, man. His daughter, Farai Mlotshwa - a property developer and the eldest of his nine children by two wives - told BBC Radio 4 that he was a ""softie"". As if to reinforce this softer image of the new leader, a cuddly crocodile soft toy was passed among the Zanu-PF supporters who welcomed him back to the country after Mr Mugabe's resignation. Emmerson Mnangagwa is known as ""Ngwena"", the Shona word for crocodile And what he lacks in charisma and oratory prowess, he makes up for in pragmatism, says close friend and Zanu-PF politician Josiah Hungwe. ""Mnangagwa is a practical person. He is a person who recognises that politics is politics but people must eat,"" he told the BBC, adding that reforming Zimbabwe's disastrous economy will be the focus of his leadership. This video can not be played Emmerson Mnangagwa: Who is the man known as the âcrocodileâ? Known as ""the crocodile"" because of his political shrewdness - his Zanu-PF faction is ""Lacoste"" Received military training in China and Egypt Tortured by Rhodesian forces after his ""crocodile gang"" staged attacks Helped direct Zimbabwe's war of independence in the 1960s and 1970s Became the country's spymaster during the 1980s civil conflict, in which thousands of civilians were killed, but has denied any role in the massacres Accused of masterminding attacks on opposition supporters after 2008 election Says he will deliver jobs, and seen as open to economic reforms Survived several alleged assassination attempts, blamed on Mugabe supporters Find out more on BBC Radio 4's Profile. The exact year of Mr Mnangagwa's birth is not known - but he is thought to be 75, which would make him nearly 20 years younger than his predecessor who left power aged 93. Born in the central region of Zvishavane, he is a Karanga - the largest clan of Zimbabwe's majority Shona community. Some Karangas felt it was their turn for power, following 37 years of domination by Mr Mugabe's Zezuru clan, though Mr Mnangagwa was accused of profiting while under Mr Mugabe. According to a United Nations report in 2001, he was seen as ""the architect of the commercial activities of Zanu-PF"". This largely related to the operations of the Zimbabwean army and businessmen in the Democratic Republic of Congo. Zimbabwean troops intervened in the DR Congo conflict on the side of the government and, like those of other countries, were accused of using the conflict to loot some of its rich natural resources such as diamonds, gold and other minerals. More recently military officials - many behind his rise to power -have been accused of benefiting from the rich Marange diamond fields in eastern Zimbabwe, with reports of killings and human rights abuses there. Despite his money-raising role, Mr Mnangagwa, a lawyer who grew up in Zambia, was not always well-loved by the rank and file of his own party. A Zanu-PF official posed an interesting question when asked about Mr Mnangagwa's prospects: ""You think Mugabe is bad, but have you thought that whoever comes after him could be even worse?"" The opposition candidate who defeated Mr Mnangagwa in the 2000 parliamentary campaign in Kwekwe Central, Blessing Chebundo, might agree. During a bitter campaign, Mr Chebundo escaped death by a whisker when the Zanu-PF youths who had abducted him and doused him with petrol were unable to light a match. Those who fought in Zimbabwe's war of independence have long monopolised power Mr Mnangagwa's fearsome reputation was made during the civil war which broke out in the 1980s between Mr Mugabe's Zanu party and the Zapu party of Joshua Nkomo. As national security minister, he was in charge of the Central Intelligence Organisation (CIO), which worked hand in glove with the army to suppress Zapu. Thousands of civilians - mainly ethnic Ndebeles, seen as Zapu supporters - were killed in a campaign known as Gukurahundi, before the two parties merged to form Zanu-PF. Among countless other atrocities carried out by the North Korean-trained Fifth Brigade of the army, villagers were forced at gunpoint to dance on the freshly dug graves of their relatives and chant pro-Mugabe slogans. Mr Mnangagwa has denied any role in the massacres, but the wounds are still painful and many party officials, not to mention voters, in Matabeleland might find it hard to back Mr Mnangagwa. He does enjoy the support of many of the war veterans who led the campaign of violence against the white farmers and the opposition from 2000. They remember him as one of the men who, following his military training in China and Egypt, directed the fight for independence in the 1960s and 1970s. He also attended the Beijing School of Ideology, run by the Chinese Communist Party. Mr Mnangagwa's official profile says he was the victim of state violence after being arrested by the white-minority government in the former Rhodesia in 1965, when the ""crocodile gang"" he led helped blow up a train near Fort Victoria (now Masvingo). ""He was tortured, severely resulting in him losing his sense of hearing in one ear,"" the profile says. ""Part of the torture techniques involved being hanged with his feet on the ceiling and the head down. The severity of the torture made him unconscious for days."" As he said he was under 21 at the time, he was not executed but instead sentenced to 10 years in prison. ""He has scars from that period. He was young and brave,"" a close friend of Mr Mnangagwa once said, asking not to be named. ""Perhaps that explains why he is indifferent. Horrible things happened to him when he was young."" Have Zimbabwe's generals turned into democrats? The crusader taking on Zimbabwe's 'crocodile' Zimbabwe's exiled white farmers return Snapping at the heels of Zimbabwe's 'crocodile' The age factor His ruthlessness, which it could be argued he learnt from his Rhodesian torturers, is said to have been seen again in 2008 when he reportedly masterminded Zanu-PF's response to Mr Mugabe losing the first round of the president election to long-time rival Morgan Tsvangirai. The military and state security organisations unleashed a campaign of violence against opposition supporters, leaving hundreds dead and forcing thousands from their homes. Mr Tsvangirai then pulled out of the second round and Mr Mugabe was re-elected. Mr Mnangagwa has not commented on allegations he was involved in planning the violence, but an insider in the party's security department later confirmed that he was the political link between the army, intelligence and Zanu-PF. He was seen as Mr Mugabe's right-hand man - that is until the former first lady Grace Mugabe became politically ambitious and tried to edge him out. Their rivalry took a bizarre turn when he fell ill in August 2017 at a political rally led by former President Mugabe and had to be airlifted to South Africa. Grace Mugabe (right) bit off more than she could chew by taking on Mr Mnangagwa His supporters suggested that a rival group within Zanu-PF had poisoned him and appeared to blame ice cream from Mrs Mugabe's dairy firm. In his first words to cheering supporters after Mr Mugabe's resignation, he spoke about this plot and another plan to ""eliminate"" him. He has also blamed a group linked to the former first lady for an explosion in June at a Zanu-PF rally in Bulawayo in which two people died. But in a BBC interview, he said the country was safe, told foreign investors not to worry and sought to dispel his ruthless reputation: ""I am as soft as wool. I am a very soft person in life."" This video can not be played Mnangagwa: Criminal will be hounded down, but Zimbabwe is safe His youngest son, a Harare DJ known as St Emmo, blames his reticence for his fearsome reputation. ""He was a good father, very very strict. He doesn't say much and I think that's what frightens people - like: 'What is he thinking?'"" Nick Mangwana, Zanu-PF representative in the UK, accepts that the Zimbabwe's new leader is ""not the most eloquent"". ""He's not pally-pally but more of a do-er, more of a technocrat."" But in his six months in power he has fully embraced Twitter and Facebook - after the Bulawayo blast he posted a message reiterating the strength his Christian faith gives him.

"This video can not be played The chancellor abolishes stamp duty on homes under Â£300,000 to help first-time buyers. Chancellor Philip Hammond has given a sobering assessment of the economy, saying it is expected to grow more slowly than previously thought. But he sought to rally Conservative MPs in his Budget by scrapping stamp duty for the first Â£300,000 spent by first-time buyers, a saving of up to Â£5,000. The cut will apply to buyers in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. Mr Hammond also promised Â£1.5bn to ""address concerns"" about the flagship universal credit scheme. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said the government had a ""record of failure"". Key points at-a-glance: A Budget summary Budget Live: Rolling text and video updates What the Budget 2017 means for you In depth: The BBC's Budget coverage At the start of his speech, Mr Hammond struck a positive note, saying the economy continued to ""confound those who seek to talk it down"" by creating jobs and continuing to grow. But he then said productivity levels remained ""stubbornly flat"" with growth until 2021 expected to be lower than predicted in March. It is the first time in a generation that growth is forecast to grow below 2% every year. Mr Hammond's statement came with him under pressure from Eurosceptic Tory MPs and others calling for more spending to ease austerity. The chancellor - who has been accused of being too pessimistic about life outside the EU - said Â£3bn would be spent on Brexit planning, and that the government would prepare for ""every possible outcome"" Freezing alcohol duty apart from an increase in duty on high-strength white ciders The price of 20 cigarettes goes up by 28p and by 41p for 30g of rolling tobacco A promise to fund a pay rise for nurses if one is recommended by an independent panel Refunds onVAT for Scottish emergency services A one-offtax on new diesel carsthat do not meet latest emissions standards Â£28m for Kensington and Chelsea council for counselling and regeneration in the aftermath of the Grenfell Tower fire Bringing forward a plannedcut in business rate risesby two years to 2018 An extraÂ£2.8bn for the NHSin England up to 2022 Support for electric cars including a Â£400m charging infrastructure fund Anew railcardoffering discounts to those aged between 26 and 30 Housing had been billed as one of the key themes of the Budget - and the chancellor promised the ""next generation"" that getting on the housing ladder would not be just a ""dream"". Promising the government would deliver 300,000 new homes a year, he pledged Â£44bn capital investment and measures aimed at getting building projects started. And towards the end of his speech he made the pledge on stamp duty, which is paid by people buying properties over a certain value. Rates vary across the UK - in England, Wales and Northern Ireland it kicks in at Â£125,000 - and in Scotland, which has its own devolved tax - at Â£145,000. The cut will only operate in Wales until the matter is devolved next April and stamp duty replaced by a land transaction tax. Mr Hammond said his change would benefit 95% of first-time buyers. But in its assessment, the Office for Budget Responsibility said the main gainers would be those who already own a home. It also said it would lead to higher house prices and predicted it would only lead to an extra 3,500 first-time buyer purchases. Among the Â£44bn package was a pledge to make it easier for councils to build in areas of high housing need. There was also a threat to intervene with compulsory purchase orders if landowners and developers were found to be holding back on building ""for commercial rather than technical reasons"". Mr Hammond said investing more money alone would simply inflate prices and make matters worse. He added: ""Solving the housing challenge takes more than money, it takes planning reform. We will focus on the urban areas where people want to live... building high quality, high density homes."" As well as spending announcements, the chancellor also uses his Budget to update MPs on the state of the economy. And they cast a shadow on his other announcements, with the Office for Budget Responsibility predicting the economy would grow by 1.5% this year, down from the estimate of 2% it made in March. Growth, it says, will drop to 1.3% by 2020 and then rise to 1.5% in 2021, lower in every year than was predicted in March. Borrowing was predicted to be Â£8.4bn lower than in March, but long-term deficit predictions were hiked to Â£34.7bn in 2019, going down to Â£30.1bn in 2021. Mr Hammond said he was still on track to hit his target to balance the nation's books by the middle of the next decade. Sharp cut to UK growth forecast Another high-profile announcement was on universal credit, which is the government's major reform to the way benefits are paid and is currently being rolled out across the UK. Campaigners and MPs in all parties have been calling for changes to the way it is managed. The Â£1.5bn will remove a mandatory seven-day wait after someone submits a claim, taking the overall wait down from six weeks to five. Mr Hammond also said it would become  easier for claimants to receive an advance. Reality Check: What do Universal Credit reforms mean? This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn: ""So much for tackling injustices"" Responding in the Commons, Mr Corbyn predicted the Budget would unravel, warning ""misery"" will continue for people across the country. He cited falling wages and added that economic growth in the first three quarters of this year was the lowest since 2009. The Labour leader also noted the lack of major social care policies in Mr Hammond's statement. And he reacted angrily to a heckle from the Tory benches as he said elderly people were not receiving good enough care. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"The chancellor has been urged to deliver a ""cautious"" Budget or risk alienating investors. Rupert Harrison, former chief of staff to George Osborne, said that Philip Hammond should not radically change strategy by increasing borrowing significantly. Mr Hammond is under pressure to be ""big and bold"" inthe Budgetwhich he will deliver at 12.30pm. He will say that he is ""optimistic"" about the future of the UK economy. But with a major downgrade expected to productivity - the ability of the economy to create wealth - his room for spending giveaways will be limited. Mr Harrison told the BBC that with Brexit uncertainty and nervousness about the direction the UK economy is heading, the markets would be keener on a ""steady as she goes"" message. ""You don't want to surprise the world by saying we're embarking on a new strategy, we're going to borrow lots of money, raise taxes,"" he said. ""I think in a moment when the world has got some question marks about the UK anyway, it's time for a bit of consistency and a bit of patience."" Budget to make UK 'fit for Brexit future' Budget 2017: What you need to know Why isnât the UK more productive? Rupert Harrison is now a senior figure at BlackRock, one of the largest investment firms in the world with over Â£4 trillion of funds under its control. The government relies on international investors to fund its deficit, the difference between what it spends on services and receives in taxes. And the cost of servicing that debt is rising as inflation (a lot of government debt is linked to the rise in prices) and interest rates rise. Mr Harrison said that the chancellor did have some limited wriggle room. ""If we look at the big picture, back in 2010, we had a budget deficit of 10% of GDP [the country's Gross Domestic Product, or national income],"" he said. ""That was very high and I think a risk to economic stability. It needed to be dealt with [and] that deficit is now just 3% of GDP."" He added: ""That means that it's not an urgent immediate issue - the chancellor has a little bit of wriggle room to maybe spend a little bit more on infrastructure, a little bit on housing. ""But I don't think he should abandon the longer-term ambition to keep the public finances under control and start getting our debt down, because in the end the UK is still vulnerable."" It is expected that the Office for Budget Responsibility - the official economic watchdog - will downgrade its forecasts for growth and productivity when it publishes its economic outlook report alongside the Budget. Lower productivity means the economy expands less quickly and the government receives less in tax revenues and may have to borrow more. It also means that people are less likely to receive higher wage increases. He believes his ""fiscal rule"" - a promise to balance the government's public finances by 2025 - is vital to investor confidence in the UK economy. But, with borrowing slightly lower than expected, Mr Hammond is expected to announce a major package of support for new housing as well as more spending on infrastructure such as digital broadband and 5G mobile. It is possible he will also announce more spending on health, although it is unlikely to be the Â£4bn demanded by the chief executive of the NHS, Simon Stevens. There have been calls to reverse corporation tax cuts, which are due to fall to 17% by 2020. But that would appear to be a direct contradiction of a pledge in the Conservative election manifesto to ""stick to the plan"" to cut the tax. Mr Harrison said that halting further cuts to business taxes might be possible: ""But I think you need to be careful about the signals you send if you put it up"". ""I think there's much more nervousness about the UK than there was around the world,"" Mr Harrison said. ""We used to be seen as a very predictable, reliable, business friendly place to come to do business and to invest, I think people are now starting to question that [and are asking] what is it the UK really wants?"" He said that people do not really understand the whole Brexit process which he said has raised the level of uncertainty. ""So I think that puts a premium for the UK government on trying to signal as much certainty as it can, trying to reduce that uncertainty, set out a clear strategy,"" Mr Harrison said. ""The next time we have an economic downturn, with high levels of debt, a big banking system, it's a question of how much patience do we have to really put ourselves in the best possible position for the future."" He said: ""I think financial markets wouldn't punish the UK in the short term if there was a little bit more spending on infrastructure, if there were good projects that could be shown to produce good economic returns. ""I think where there would be more concern is if there was a sense that the UK government was essentially abandoning its ambitions to deal with the public finances longer term.""

"Robert Gabriel Mugabe was educated at a mission school and went on to train as teacher, graduating from Fort Hare university where Nelson Mandela studied. In 1958, he went to work in Ghana There he met Sally Hafron whom he married in 1961. She was actually more political than him before he was recruited by black nationalists. He was later imprisoned by the Rhodesian government, but was not allowed to attend the funeral of his son After his release from jail in 1974, he came to prominence as one of the leaders of a guerrilla war against white-minority rule, along with Joshua Nkomo (left) They agreed to disarm at peace talks hosted by the British. They formed the patriotic front - and to the surprise of Western observers won elections held in February 1980 by a landslide Robert Mugabe had arrived in the country only six weeks before the election, after spending 10 years in exile. He became prime minister, forming an inclusive government During his first years in office, he was feted by leaders across the world, including Cuba's Fidel Castro, who visited the country in 1986 He also had a close relationship with UK Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher - and initially pursued a policy of reconciliation with his white former enemies, letting them keep their economic wealth He married his typist Grace Marufu, with whom he already had two children, in 1996 a few years after his first wife died. The 1990s also saw the country's intervention in the war in the Democratic Republic of Congo, which proved costly to the economy When Tony Blair's UK government pulled out of talks to fund controversial land reforms in 1997 and after Mr Mugabe lost a referendum on a new constitution three years later, pro-Mugabe militias began to invade white-owned farms It was around this time that Mr Mugabe abandoned his Savile Row and safari suits in favour of brightly coloured attire emblazoned with his face when he was on the campaign trail It became a cult of personality, and big celebrations were organised by the ruling Zanu-PF party each year to mark his birthday... These included extravagant cakes. This one reflects how many Africans regarded him as a hero, admiring his stand against white farmers However, his popularity, especially in urban areas, steadily declined at home - and he lost the first round of the presidential election in 2008, winning the run-off after the opposition MDC withdrew, citing violence Sanctions imposed by the US and EU prompted Mr Mugabe's ""Look East"" policy, turning to China for investment. He used to travel to Asia for medical treatment - his daughter Bona (C) studied in Hong Kong and Singapore His Zanu-PF party won elections in 2013, after four years of a power-sharing government, on a platform of indigenisation - a policy of ceding economic control to black Zimbabweans. Crippling cash shortages led to protests in 2016 However, the security forces always stood by Mr Mugabe - until his wife's ambition for power proved too much for them to stomach and they launched a takeover on 15 November 2017 They were anxious that it not look like a coup, and Mr Mugabe carried on with some of his duties - though his age showed as he appeared to doze during a graduation ceremony But after a mass demonstration and amid impeachment proceedings, the 93-year-old leader bowed to pressure. He resigned after 37 years in power - prompting wild celebrations. All pictures copyright Â© 2025 BBC.

"The resignation of Robert Mugabe comes after Zimbabwe's military took over the country and put him under house arrest Theresa May has welcomed the resignation of Robert Mugabe in Zimbabwe, saying it offered an opportunity to ""rebuild the country's economy"". The president stepped down after 37 years in power via a letter that was read out to the country's parliament. It followed a takeover by the Zimbabwean military, who put Mr Mugabe under house arrest last week. Boris Johnson called the end of Mr Mugabe's reign a ""moment of hope."" Zimbabwe's President Mugabe resigns Live updates from Harare Robert Mugabe - hero or villain? How Zimbabwe is celebrating The 93-year-old had resisted calls to step down, despite the intervention of the country's military and protests across the capital of Harare. However, on Tuesday, parliament speaker Jacob Mudenda read a letter from the former leader of Zanu-PF, which said his decision was ""voluntary"" and ""arising from my concern for the welfare of the people of Zimbabwe."" Responding to the announcement, Mrs May said: ""In recent days we have seen the desire of the Zimbabwean people for free and fair elections and the opportunity to rebuild the country's economy under a legitimate government. ""As Zimbabwe's oldest friend, we will do all we can to support this, working with our international and regional partners to help the country achieve the brighter future it so deserves."" The foreign secretary also welcomed the announcement, but warned it should not mark ""the transition from one despotic rule to another"". Mr Johnson said: ""I think it's very important at the moment that we don't focus too much on the personalities. ""Let's concentrate on the potential, the hope for Zimbabwe - an incredible country, a beautiful country, blessed with extraordinary physical and human potential."" This video can not be played Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson says Robert Mugabe's resignation as president is a ""moment of hope"" for Zimbabwe Asked about what he thought should happen to Mr Mugabe and his wife Grace - who the former leader had been priming as a successor - he added: ""[Mr Mugabe] played an important part in the birth of the independent nation of Zimbabwe. ""And yet, tragically, he allowed that legacy to be squandered and his country went to rack and ruin and in some cases his people were driven to the brink of starvation. ""It's time now for a new future and how Robert Mugabe spends the rest of his years is very much a matter for his countrymen."" Labour MP and former Africa minister, Peter Hain, said the president's attempt to ensure Grace Mugabe would follow in his footsteps was his downfall. He told BBC News: ""It was his determination to create a family dynasty and protect himself that finally meant his party gave up on him and the ruling elite gave up on him as well. ""The Zanu-PF party, that Mugabe had controlled with an iron fist, reacted against it and would not accept his wife being ushered in as his presidential replacement. ""The military said we have had enough and we are not going to put up with this, although they had ruled with him and supported him at times in murderous extermination of the opposition. Lord Peter Hain met with Mr Mugabe when he was the minister for Africa in 1999 Lord Hain added that the people of Zimbabwe had the chance for a ""fresh start"", and called on former vice president Emmerson Mnangagwa, who is expected to will be sworn in as president in the coming days, to take the country ""in a different direction"". Salil Shetty, secretary general of London-based Amnesty International, said Mr Mugabe's leadership had allowed ""grotesque crimes to thrive"", but his resignation was a turning point. She said: ""After more than three decades of violent repression, the way forward for the country is to renounce the abuses of the past and transition into a new era where the rule of law is respected and those who are responsible for injustices are held to account.""

"This video can not be played The chancellor abolishes stamp duty on homes under Â£300,000 to help first-time buyers. Chancellor Philip Hammond has given a sobering assessment of the economy, saying it is expected to grow more slowly than previously thought. But he sought to rally Conservative MPs in his Budget by scrapping stamp duty for the first Â£300,000 spent by first-time buyers, a saving of up to Â£5,000. The cut will apply to buyers in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. Mr Hammond also promised Â£1.5bn to ""address concerns"" about the flagship universal credit scheme. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said the government had a ""record of failure"". Key points at-a-glance: A Budget summary Budget Live: Rolling text and video updates What the Budget 2017 means for you In depth: The BBC's Budget coverage At the start of his speech, Mr Hammond struck a positive note, saying the economy continued to ""confound those who seek to talk it down"" by creating jobs and continuing to grow. But he then said productivity levels remained ""stubbornly flat"" with growth until 2021 expected to be lower than predicted in March. It is the first time in a generation that growth is forecast to grow below 2% every year. Mr Hammond's statement came with him under pressure from Eurosceptic Tory MPs and others calling for more spending to ease austerity. The chancellor - who has been accused of being too pessimistic about life outside the EU - said Â£3bn would be spent on Brexit planning, and that the government would prepare for ""every possible outcome"" Freezing alcohol duty apart from an increase in duty on high-strength white ciders The price of 20 cigarettes goes up by 28p and by 41p for 30g of rolling tobacco A promise to fund a pay rise for nurses if one is recommended by an independent panel Refunds onVAT for Scottish emergency services A one-offtax on new diesel carsthat do not meet latest emissions standards Â£28m for Kensington and Chelsea council for counselling and regeneration in the aftermath of the Grenfell Tower fire Bringing forward a plannedcut in business rate risesby two years to 2018 An extraÂ£2.8bn for the NHSin England up to 2022 Support for electric cars including a Â£400m charging infrastructure fund Anew railcardoffering discounts to those aged between 26 and 30 Housing had been billed as one of the key themes of the Budget - and the chancellor promised the ""next generation"" that getting on the housing ladder would not be just a ""dream"". Promising the government would deliver 300,000 new homes a year, he pledged Â£44bn capital investment and measures aimed at getting building projects started. And towards the end of his speech he made the pledge on stamp duty, which is paid by people buying properties over a certain value. Rates vary across the UK - in England, Wales and Northern Ireland it kicks in at Â£125,000 - and in Scotland, which has its own devolved tax - at Â£145,000. The cut will only operate in Wales until the matter is devolved next April and stamp duty replaced by a land transaction tax. Mr Hammond said his change would benefit 95% of first-time buyers. But in its assessment, the Office for Budget Responsibility said the main gainers would be those who already own a home. It also said it would lead to higher house prices and predicted it would only lead to an extra 3,500 first-time buyer purchases. Among the Â£44bn package was a pledge to make it easier for councils to build in areas of high housing need. There was also a threat to intervene with compulsory purchase orders if landowners and developers were found to be holding back on building ""for commercial rather than technical reasons"". Mr Hammond said investing more money alone would simply inflate prices and make matters worse. He added: ""Solving the housing challenge takes more than money, it takes planning reform. We will focus on the urban areas where people want to live... building high quality, high density homes."" As well as spending announcements, the chancellor also uses his Budget to update MPs on the state of the economy. And they cast a shadow on his other announcements, with the Office for Budget Responsibility predicting the economy would grow by 1.5% this year, down from the estimate of 2% it made in March. Growth, it says, will drop to 1.3% by 2020 and then rise to 1.5% in 2021, lower in every year than was predicted in March. Borrowing was predicted to be Â£8.4bn lower than in March, but long-term deficit predictions were hiked to Â£34.7bn in 2019, going down to Â£30.1bn in 2021. Mr Hammond said he was still on track to hit his target to balance the nation's books by the middle of the next decade. Sharp cut to UK growth forecast Another high-profile announcement was on universal credit, which is the government's major reform to the way benefits are paid and is currently being rolled out across the UK. Campaigners and MPs in all parties have been calling for changes to the way it is managed. The Â£1.5bn will remove a mandatory seven-day wait after someone submits a claim, taking the overall wait down from six weeks to five. Mr Hammond also said it would become  easier for claimants to receive an advance. Reality Check: What do Universal Credit reforms mean? This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn: ""So much for tackling injustices"" Responding in the Commons, Mr Corbyn predicted the Budget would unravel, warning ""misery"" will continue for people across the country. He cited falling wages and added that economic growth in the first three quarters of this year was the lowest since 2009. The Labour leader also noted the lack of major social care policies in Mr Hammond's statement. And he reacted angrily to a heckle from the Tory benches as he said elderly people were not receiving good enough care. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"This video can not be played Do you know how alcohol changes your mood? Different types of alcoholic drink change and shape your mood in different ways, says a study into drinking and emotions. Spirits may make you feel angry, sexy or tearful, while red wine or beer may make you feel relaxed, say researchers. They questioned nearly 30,000 people aged 18-34 from 21 different countries for the study in the journalBMJ Open,external. All the respondents drank beer, wine and spirits, and many said each type of alcohol had a different effect on them. While having a few drinks can be enjoyable, researchers hope their findings will help highlight the dangers of dependent drinking. People build up tolerance to alcohol over time and can end up drinking more to feel the same ""positive"" effects that they enjoy. But they also risk getting negative ones too, says researcher Prof Mark Bellis from Public Health Wales NHS Trust. The anonymous online survey, which recruited respondents via newspaper and magazine adverts and social media, found: Red wine appeared to make people more lethargic than white wine Respondents were most likely to report feeling relaxed when drinking red wine or beer More than 40% said drinking spirits made them feel sexy Over half said drinking spirits also gave them energy and confidence But around a third said they felt aggressive when drinking spirits Drinking spirits was more likely than all other drink types to be associated with feelings of aggression, illness, restlessness and tearfulness Men were significantly more likely than women to associate feelings of aggression with all types of alcohol, particularly heavier drinkers However, the findings show only an association and do not explain the reasons for changes. Prof Bellis said the setting in which the alcohol was consumed was an important factor that the study tried to take into consideration by asking about drinking at home and outside of the home. ""Young people will often drink spirits on a night out, whereas wine might be drunk more at home, with a meal. ""There will be an element of expectation too. Someone who wants to relax might choose to have a beer or a glass of wine."" He said the way different drinks are marketed and promoted might encourage people to select certain drinks to suit different moods, but that this could backfire if it triggered negative emotions. ""People may rely on alcohol to help them feel a certain way. People might drink to feel more confident or relaxed but they also risk other negative emotional responses too."" Prof Bellis and his colleagues at King's College London said the findings suggested that dependent drinkers might rely on alcohol to generate the positive emotions they associated with drinking - they were five times more likely to feel energised than low-risk drinkers. He also said the study revealed a difference between men and women's emotional relationship with different alcoholic drinks. ""We got stronger emotional relationships with women across pretty well every type of emotion, except for aggression."" Aggression, he said, was more likely to be felt among men. Dr John Larsen, from Drinkaware, said: ""This study highlights the importance of understanding why people choose to drink certain alcoholic drinks and what effect they expect these drinks will have on them. ""The UK chief medical officers' guideline for both men and women states that in order to keep health risks from alcohol to a low level it is safest not to be drinking more than 14 units a week on a regular basis."" That equates to 12 single measures of spirits, six pints of beer or six 175ml glasses of wine a week. Experts say setting a minimum unit price of 50 pence per unit would help cut alcohol-related deaths. A minimum price policy will come into force on 1 May 2018 in Scotland. Legislation to establish a minimum price is currently under active consideration by the Welsh Government and by the Irish Senate. There are no plans yet to do the same in England, although the Home Office says the policy is under review.
