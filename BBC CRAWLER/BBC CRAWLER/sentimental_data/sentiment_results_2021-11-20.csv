"Unsafe toys, counterfeit clothing, and incorrectly-labelled nicotine products were taken off the street Police have seized an ""astonishing"" haul of fake designer goods and illegal items in pre-Christmas raids in London's Oxford Street. More than 17,500 items were confiscated in Operation Jade, which saw four souvenir and sweet shops raided on Thursday night. Officers took unsafe toys, counterfeit clothing, and incorrectly-labelled nicotine products off the street. An unregistered food business also had 4,000 items removed. Two bags of food with higher than the legal limit of THC - the main psychoactive compound in cannabis - were also confiscated. Heather Acton, from Westminster City Council, said shoppers needed to be able to trust the products they were buying from the busiest shopping street in London. ""The quantity and variety of goods seized by our officers is astonishing,"" she said. ""Many of these goods are unsafe and certainly unhealthy. ""From cheap imitations of fashionable products to mislabelled tobacco, and even psychoactive substances, it's vital that we protect customers and get these products off the shelves. ""This Christmas is make or break for many high street shops, and checking retailers will support legitimate businesses and protect the reputation of the West End as a leading destination for shoppers."" Officers seized 2,500 souvenirs from unregistered businesses and illegal street traders Meanwhile, Trading Standards officers seized 11,000 goods and about 2,500 souvenirs from unregistered businesses and illegal street traders. Health and safety officers also served three notices for unsafe electrical goods and poor safety standards within premises.

"A review into how to prevent migrants crossing the English Channel to the UK is to be led by Cabinet Office minister Stephen Barclay. It comes amid record numbers of people making the journey this year, withmore than 1,000 crossing in a single day earlier this month. Home Secretary Priti Patel has promised tougher action but numbers have continued to rise. It is understood Prime Minister Boris Johnson thinks more action is needed. Mr Barclay will be responsible for exploring what ministerial departments can do in an effort to make the issue more of a priority in government and the civil service. What happens to migrants who reach the UK? More than 500 migrants cross the English Channel More than 24,700 people have made the crossing from France to the UK by boat so far this year - almost three times the total of about 8,500 in 2020. Only five people have been returned to the EU so far this year. More groups of people, including children, arrived in Kent on Saturday. The numbers arriving in the latest crossings have not yet been provided by the Home Office. In an agreement signed in July, the UK pledged to give France â¬62.7m (Â£54m) during 2021-22 to help tackle the issue. The deal said the UK would help France increase police patrols along its coastline, boost aerial surveillance and increase security infrastructure at ports but record numbers of people have continued to arrive. Conservative MP Tim Loughton, a member of the Commons home affairs select committee, said France should be doing more to intercept boats. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""We know the only real solution is for the French to do what they are legally entitled but also legally obliged to do and that's to intercept the boats when they're in the water and take the passengers back to French territory."" Mr Loughton said it was ""absolutely within the power of the French to stop this miserable trade"". But Dimitris Avramopoulos, a former minister of foreign affairs for Greece and EU commissioner for migration, urged the UK and France not to blame each other and instead work together and with the European Union to secure a deal. He told Today: ""It is not easy to cope with the situation by blaming the other. I think they should immediately deepen co-operation in a spirit of mutual trust and basing their policy on the same principles."" For some time now, the government has talked tough on the idea of cracking down on small boats crossing the Channel. Ministers believe people smugglers are exploiting people who want to come to the UK to claim asylum or start a new life. Deals have been signed with France to try to deter people from making the journey in the first place. But measures so far haven't worked - this year has seen a record number of people making the dangerous journey. That's left many Conservative MPs worried and Labour criticising the government for failing to bring numbers down. The prime minister is said to want more action. But a review of what can be done cross-government won't itself solve this issue which has troubled the Home Office for years. TheDaily Telegraph,externalreported Ms Patel was planning to introduce strict new rules for asylum seekers, similar to those in Greece. The paper said the home secretary was impressed with centres being built in Greece, where migrants are put under strict curfews and face routine checks on their movements. But Mr Avramopoulos said the situation in the UK was different because its maritime borders with France are ""very complex"". On Friday, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmeraccused the government of failing to deliver on its pledges to reduce migrant Channel crossings. He said the UK had not secured ""strong"" agreements with France to prevent journeys from taking place. TheTimes reported,externalthat Conservative MPs have warned the prime minister the extent of crossings risked becoming a big electoral issue for the party. Ms Patel this week said the EU's open borders regime was partly to blame. She told reporters during a visit to the United States that she was ""constantly pressing"" the French on the issue but they were ""overwhelmed"". ""Let's not forget that the real problem on illegal migration flows is the EU has no border protections whatsoever,"" Ms Patel said. BANISH YOUR BRAIN FOG:Quick tips to boost energy this winter!

"A European brown bear roaming the French Pyrenees (file photo) A 70-year-old man has shot dead a brown bear in south-western France after it attacked and injured him while he was out hunting wild boar, officials say. The man reportedly fired two shots with a rifle at the female bear, who was wandering with her cubs at the time, killing the animal instantly. Local media report that the man suffered serious leg injuries and was taken to a hospital in Toulouse. Police are now investigating the Saturday afternoon incident. The man, part of a local hunting association in the Seix region of AriÃ¨ge, had been bitten by the bear several times, causing damage to the arteries in his legs, police said. AFP news agency reports that a source close to the case said the man was in a serious condition. Police said they responded to an emergency call at about 15:30 local time (14:30 GMT) and when they arrived at the scene, they discovered the dead bear just metres from where the hunter was lying injured. A member of the same hunting association, who was not named, told local news website La Depeche that he heard a call for help on a radio the group uses while hunting, and made his way to the scene of the attack. ""One person managed to stop the bleeding until help arrived,"" he said. A local council official in AriÃ¨ge, Christine Tequi, said that such attacks were ""what we feared"". ""Today, you can really see that cohabitation is complicated,"" she told AFP. France began reintroducing brown bears to the Pyrenees after numbers of the animals plummeted in the 1990s. But the move has sparked protests from local farmers who say the bears pose a risk to their livestock.

"The Afrobeats star said the appeal had been ""playful"" Afrobeats star Davido says he will give away 250m Nigerian Naira ($608,000; Â£450,000) to orphanages in Nigeria after fans sent him money. Earlier this week, the musician asked fans who believe ""I've given you a hit song"" to send money to a bank account he detailed under his name. Davido on Saturday said the appeal had been made in a ""playful manner"", but had exceeded his expectations. He thanked those who had donated cash, as he announced how it would be used. The amount being given to orphanages includes fan donations and a personal contribution of N50m. Davido is considered one of Africa's biggest music stars. He has won MTV and BET music awards and has collaborated with international artists including Chris Brown and Nicki Minaj. His social media request this week had been met witha mixed reception. Some pointed out that the star, who has some 22 million followers on Instagram, often flashes his lavish lifestyle online. In one Twitter post with laughing emojis, Davido said his aim was to raise money to get his Rolls-Royce car cleared from a port. He then shared bank account details and screenshots as the amount it contained continued to grow over a couple of days. In hisSaturday statement,external, the singer said it was his goal to do this fundraising for his birthday every year as a way to give back.

"This video can not be played Seeing premature baby in incubator 'very scary' When Ceri Roberts first saw her newborn son, it was not the moment she had been expecting. Seth was nine weeks' premature and wrapped in a bundle of tubes, wires and an oxygen mask inside an incubator. ""It was a rollercoaster of emotions,"" said the 35-year-old. A neonatal charity is now asking for better support for parents to help them deal with the stress and strain of having an early birth. Seth, now six, is healthy and enjoying primary school, along with his brother Aron, four, who was also an early arrival. Aron arrived at 35 weeks, after two interventions by specialists when Ceri went into labour first at 27 weeks of her pregnancy. Having premature baby is a ""rollercoaster of emotions"" says the mother of Seth Roberts - born nine weeks early ""I felt the pregnancy and labour and having Seth and Aron born early, spending time in hospital, was difficult and different to my friends and family who have children,"" said Ceri, who lives with husband Elis near Bangor, Gwynedd. ""They were able to come home, people could come to the house to see them, whereas we were in hospital, with visiting hours. ""When Seth was in the high dependency unit for a couple of weeks it was only the grandparents who could come to see him. ""So that was very difficult."" Just being able to hold Seth was a special moment for Ceri and Elis Ceri and her husband spent two months living in family accommodation at the hospital. ""When I first saw Seth, he was a little bundle in a massive incubator, with all the tubes and masks and wires. It was very, very scary,"" said Ceri. ""I was over the moon that I had a son, and I wanted to share that with the world. ""But then there was the worry. Is he going to be OK? Are there any problems?"" World's most premature baby leaves hospital Premature baby 'sleeves' is viral hit Tech keeping premature baby parents in touch Hitting milestones were important. ""We celebrated when he was able to sleep without an oxygen mask, or when I was able to put clothes on them for the first time. ""Small milestones like that were massive achievements for us as a family, and for Seth."" Meeting his brother: Seth sees Aron in an incubator at Glan Clwyd Hospital Ceri praised the medical support they received for both sons but says there are wellbeing gaps for other parents with premature children. ""There aren't the parent and children clubs or baby groups for those who have been through what I've been through,"" she said. Time for Aron to leave hospital and return home with brother Seth Figures show 2,800 babies needed neonatal care in Wales in 2020. The charity Bliss said about 2,400 babies needing help are born early, which is about 8% of all births in Wales. But the charity said psychological support for parents is ""patchy"". ""When a baby is born premature or unwell and in need of neonatal care, parents often described to Bliss that their world has been turned upside down,"" said policy and research manager Josie Anderson. ""It places a huge amount of stress and anxiety on families."" Ceri and Elis Roberts' two sons are now fit. lively, young children The charity said those who have experienced a premature birth could be more likely to have post-natal depression, or develop post-traumatic stress symptoms. ""The long-term ramifications for families can be really devastating."" Bliss has been working with NSPCC Cymru to push for better mental health and wellbeing support in Wales, with the matter raised this week in the Senedd to mark World Prematurity Day. First Minister Mark Drakeford said he had seen first hand during his time serving as health minister the impact a premature birth can have on parents and it was a ""deeply distressing experience for many of them"". ""There are Royal College standards in this area, which every health board is working to meet, and where new funding has been made available by the Welsh government to assist them in doing so,"" he told the Senedd.

"Charlie Millers died while sectioned in hospital under the Mental Health Act The number of deaths of people being treated under the Mental Health Act in England rose during the coronavirus pandemic, estimates suggest. The Care Quality Commission's (CQC) findings come amid concerns over staff shortages in psychiatric units. Some 490 people died while detained under the act in the year to March 2021 - 324 of them for non-Covid reasons, the regulator says. BBC analysis found the average overall figure between 2012 and 2019 was 273. Former Conservative Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt warned that staff shortages were now compromising patient safety in ""every part of the NHS"". How has coronavirus affected mental health? Child mental health not improved since lockdown Why the NHS is struggling like never before He called the figures on deaths in psychiatric detention ""very concerning"", but added: ""It's not just mental health, but every specialty now has shortages of doctors and nurses."" Mr Hunt argued a ""radical overhaul"" of the training system was needed to ensure there were enough doctors and nurses in the coming decades. Charlie Millers died on 7 December last year while sectioned in a secure psychiatric unit. The 17-year-old was detained in Prestwich Hospital, in Greater Manchester, with a history of suicide attempts and self-harm. He attempted to take his own life four times in two-and-a-half hours - the last one proving fatal. A confidential Greater Manchester Mental Health NHS Foundation Trust report, seen by the BBC, reveals staff shortages in the unit, with the senior nurse in charge agreeing to do a double shift because no cover was available. It also says another nurse was not given a full handover when he started his shift. This video can not be played The BBC speaks to Samantha Millers, whose son Charlie died while under section at Prestwich Hospital Speaking to the BBC, Charlie's mother Samantha described her reaction to hearing he had attempted suicide several times that night. ""I was like 'How has he done three, a fourth one? How did it get to that?'"" she said. Mr Hunt, who now chairs the Commons Health and Social Care Committee, said Charlie's death illustrated the need for community-based alternatives to hospital detention. ""We still put far too many people into secure accommodation, [when] you haven't committed any crime, just because it's the only option left,"" he told BBC News. In its report on the incident, the trust admitted that it was not ""routine practice"" for the nurse in charge to work a double shift, but the unit ""needed an experienced qualified nurse on duty"" and there was no evidence her judgment was impaired by the long hours. It also backed the decision not to put Charlie on continuous observation, saying it would have led to increased tension and risk to him. The report clears the unit of any wrongdoing. In a statement, trust deputy chief executive Andrew Maloney expressed his ""deepest sympathies"" to Charlie's family and friends but said: ""It would be inappropriate for us to comment further until the coroner's inquest has concluded."" But the report comes amid rising concern over staff shortages during the pandemic putting the most vulnerable NHS patients in danger. According to the CQC, 490 people died while detained under the Mental Health Act in England between the start of March 2020 and the end of March 2021. It said 166 of those deaths were due to Covid-19, while 324 people were said to have died for ""non-Covid"" reasons. Between 2012 and 2019, an average of 273 people died per year either while detained in hospital or being supervised in the community in England while subject to the Mental Health Act. The CQC said there had been changes in the reporting methods of deaths in detention during the pandemic. Mental health charity Mind called Charlie's death ""a sad moment in the history of mental health services"" and said that it was time for the government to boost staffing and provide the sector with greater investment."" Paul Farmer, the charity's chief executive, told BBC News: ""There are many reasons why this tragedy took place. But we must learn the lessons and make sure that services are fully staffed to be able to provide the help and care for some of the most vulnerable in our society."" The charity said that out of the Â£36bn already pledged to the NHS and social care sector over the next three years - up to Â£5.4bn should be earmarked for mental health services to make sure that people are ""safely treated"". A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: ""Every death is a tragedy and our sympathies go to family and friends of those who have sadly died. ""There are now record numbers of doctors and nurses working in the NHS and we are on track to deliver 50,000 more nurses by the end of this Parliament. ""We're also investing Â£2.3bn a year by 2023/24 to transform mental health care, and will bring forward our plans to reform the Mental Health Act shortly, to ensure anyone in a mental health crisis is treated with dignity and respect.""

"This video can not be played WTA chairman 'worried about Peng's safety' Chinese player Peng Shuai has still not directly been in contact with the Women's Tennis Association (WTA), which says ""no amount of money"" would stop it pulling events out of China. Peng, 35, made sexual assault allegations against a former China vice-premier two weeks ago. WTA chairman Steve Simon told the BBC there will be no events in China next year without proof that Peng is safe. ""We cannot stand by compromises. This is a right and wrong issue,"" he said. The WTA has been told Peng is safe, and in Beijing, by the Chinese Tennis Association, although Simon said there has been no confirmation that is true. Later on Friday, three photographs of Peng were posted on a WeChat account under her name with the caption 'Happy Weekend'. However, the authenticity of the post on the Chinese instant messaging servicewas questioned by BBC China media analyst Kerry Allen.,external ""I'm very, very concerned about her,"" Simon said in an interview with the BBC. World number one Novak Djokovic said he would support the WTA pulling tournaments out of China if it came to that. ""I support the statement of WTA as an organisation and also their president absolutely,"" he said. ""The whole tennis community, needs to back her up and her family, make sure that she's safe and sound because if you would have tournaments on Chinese soil without resolving this situation, it would be a little bit strange. ""I heard that the WTA is willing to pull out from China with all the tournaments unless this is resolved. I support it 100%."" Meanwhile, the United States has urged China to ""provide independent, verifiable proof"" of Peng's whereabouts and safety. US 'deeply concerned' over Peng Fears for Peng's welfare have continued to grow since she said on 3 November she was ""forced"" into a sexual relationship with former China vice-premier Zhang Gaoli. Peng made the allegations in a post on Chinese social media site Weibo and they were soon deleted from China's internet. It is the first time such a claim has been made against one of China's senior political leaders. Simon added: ""I'm very concerned about the challenges that come when somebody has the courage to step up and speak out, bringing a past experience that is tied to sexual assault or harassment. ""It takes an awful lot of courage just to get to that point - and now she's dealing with more pressures if she is hearing what is going on. ""It is critical to us that we are able to make sure she knows we are worried about her and that we're prepared to offer any level of support that she needs."" Peng is a former world number one doubles player who has won two Grand Slam titles - at Wimbledon in 2013 and the 2014 French Open, both alongside Chinese Taipei's Hsieh Su-wei. Peng Shuai also achieved a career-high singles rankings of 14 in 2011 and reached the US Open singles semi-finals in 2014 Earlier this week, Chinese state media released an email attributed to Peng, butSimon cast doubtabout its authenticity. Talking to BBC tennis correspondent Russell Fuller, Simon said he did not believe speaking out strongly and demanding answers from the Chinese authorities would be counterproductive. ""Diplomacy is always very, very strong and I am sure that they would prefer we are not talking about this,"" he said. ""I think we are better addressing it than working in a vacuum where nobody knows and the world is trying to figure out our position. ""I'm very comfortable with the approach that we have taken right now, and we'll continue to do it in a very respectful and hopefully responsible way."" The WTA has heavily relied on Chinese investment in its players' tour, leading to a number of lucrative tournaments and the season-ending finals being held in the country over recent years. China hosted nine tournaments in the 2019 season with a total of $30.4m (Â£22.6m) in prize money. No events have been held in the country since the coronavirus pandemic started in March 2020. But Simon said assurances about Peng's safety and a transparent investigation into her allegations were of paramount importance to the WTA, not the financial implications of potentially pulling events out of China if these conditions are not met. ""This is not about the money, this is about doing what is right and making sure Peng Shuai is safe and free,"" added Simon. ""The sad part about this is that we have some tremendous partners and some tremendous friendships in China. ""We don't want to be in this position, but at the end of the day this is one of those decisions where compromises are not acceptable. ""We have to do what is right here and we will figure that out if we end up being in that position at the end of the day."" This video can not be played Ros Atkins on...the missing Chinese tennis star Peng Shuai Serena Williams, Andy Murray and Djokovic have been among those who have expressed their concerns about Peng's whereabouts. People from across tennis - including past and present players, coaches and journalists - have been demanding answers about Peng's welfare, as have other high-profile sports stars, actors and politicians. Many have been using #WhereIsPengShuai on Twitter posts, along with a photo of her. Wimbledon said it had been ""working in support of the WTA's efforts"" to establish her safety and was ""united with the rest of tennis in the need to understand that Peng Shuai is safe"". French doubles player Nicolas Mahut said he would not play in China until the situation is resolved and urged his fellow professionals to ""be united"" on the stance. Mahut also criticised IOC president Thomas Bach, saying it was ""embarrassing"" he had not spoken out about Peng, who is a three-time Olympian. With the Winter Olympics set to be held in Beijing in February, Global Athlete - a body which represents the interests of sports stars and includes several Olympians in its panel - said it ""condemned the IOC for staying silent"". ""The IOC has a duty to care for its athletes. Silence is unacceptable,"" it added. The United Nations said it wanted proof of Peng's whereabouts and has urged the need for an investigation ""with full transparency"". The Lawn Tennis Association, the sport's governing body in the United Kingdom, said it has ""offered assistance"" to the WTA to ""establish the safety and wellbeing"" of Peng. Allow Twitter content?

Russell Fuller, BBC tennis correspondent Pulling out of China would have significant repercussions for the finances of the WTA Tour, the earnings of its players and the spread of the sport among the country's 1.4 billion inhabitants. Steve Simon disputes the Tour has put too many eggs in one basket, but there are usually 10 Chinese events a year on the WTA schedule. Many are very lucrative. The last time the WTA Finals were able to take place in Shenzhen, in 2019, there was $14m in prize money.

"This video can not be played WTA chairman 'worried about Peng's safety' Chinese player Peng Shuai has still not directly been in contact with the Women's Tennis Association (WTA), which says ""no amount of money"" would stop it pulling events out of China. Peng, 35, made sexual assault allegations against a former China vice-premier two weeks ago. WTA chairman Steve Simon told the BBC there will be no events in China next year without proof that Peng is safe. ""We cannot stand by compromises. This is a right and wrong issue,"" he said. The WTA has been told Peng is safe, and in Beijing, by the Chinese Tennis Association, although Simon said there has been no confirmation that is true. Later on Friday, three photographs of Peng were posted on a WeChat account under her name with the caption 'Happy Weekend'. However, the authenticity of the post on the Chinese instant messaging servicewas questioned by BBC China media analyst Kerry Allen.,external ""I'm very, very concerned about her,"" Simon said in an interview with the BBC. World number one Novak Djokovic said he would support the WTA pulling tournaments out of China if it came to that. ""I support the statement of WTA as an organisation and also their president absolutely,"" he said. ""The whole tennis community, needs to back her up and her family, make sure that she's safe and sound because if you would have tournaments on Chinese soil without resolving this situation, it would be a little bit strange. ""I heard that the WTA is willing to pull out from China with all the tournaments unless this is resolved. I support it 100%."" Meanwhile, the United States has urged China to ""provide independent, verifiable proof"" of Peng's whereabouts and safety. US 'deeply concerned' over Peng Fears for Peng's welfare have continued to grow since she said on 3 November she was ""forced"" into a sexual relationship with former China vice-premier Zhang Gaoli. Peng made the allegations in a post on Chinese social media site Weibo and they were soon deleted from China's internet. It is the first time such a claim has been made against one of China's senior political leaders. Simon added: ""I'm very concerned about the challenges that come when somebody has the courage to step up and speak out, bringing a past experience that is tied to sexual assault or harassment. ""It takes an awful lot of courage just to get to that point - and now she's dealing with more pressures if she is hearing what is going on. ""It is critical to us that we are able to make sure she knows we are worried about her and that we're prepared to offer any level of support that she needs."" Peng is a former world number one doubles player who has won two Grand Slam titles - at Wimbledon in 2013 and the 2014 French Open, both alongside Chinese Taipei's Hsieh Su-wei. Peng Shuai also achieved a career-high singles rankings of 14 in 2011 and reached the US Open singles semi-finals in 2014 Earlier this week, Chinese state media released an email attributed to Peng, butSimon cast doubtabout its authenticity. Talking to BBC tennis correspondent Russell Fuller, Simon said he did not believe speaking out strongly and demanding answers from the Chinese authorities would be counterproductive. ""Diplomacy is always very, very strong and I am sure that they would prefer we are not talking about this,"" he said. ""I think we are better addressing it than working in a vacuum where nobody knows and the world is trying to figure out our position. ""I'm very comfortable with the approach that we have taken right now, and we'll continue to do it in a very respectful and hopefully responsible way."" The WTA has heavily relied on Chinese investment in its players' tour, leading to a number of lucrative tournaments and the season-ending finals being held in the country over recent years. China hosted nine tournaments in the 2019 season with a total of $30.4m (Â£22.6m) in prize money. No events have been held in the country since the coronavirus pandemic started in March 2020. But Simon said assurances about Peng's safety and a transparent investigation into her allegations were of paramount importance to the WTA, not the financial implications of potentially pulling events out of China if these conditions are not met. ""This is not about the money, this is about doing what is right and making sure Peng Shuai is safe and free,"" added Simon. ""The sad part about this is that we have some tremendous partners and some tremendous friendships in China. ""We don't want to be in this position, but at the end of the day this is one of those decisions where compromises are not acceptable. ""We have to do what is right here and we will figure that out if we end up being in that position at the end of the day."" This video can not be played Ros Atkins on...the missing Chinese tennis star Peng Shuai Serena Williams, Andy Murray and Djokovic have been among those who have expressed their concerns about Peng's whereabouts. People from across tennis - including past and present players, coaches and journalists - have been demanding answers about Peng's welfare, as have other high-profile sports stars, actors and politicians. Many have been using #WhereIsPengShuai on Twitter posts, along with a photo of her. Wimbledon said it had been ""working in support of the WTA's efforts"" to establish her safety and was ""united with the rest of tennis in the need to understand that Peng Shuai is safe"". French doubles player Nicolas Mahut said he would not play in China until the situation is resolved and urged his fellow professionals to ""be united"" on the stance. Mahut also criticised IOC president Thomas Bach, saying it was ""embarrassing"" he had not spoken out about Peng, who is a three-time Olympian. With the Winter Olympics set to be held in Beijing in February, Global Athlete - a body which represents the interests of sports stars and includes several Olympians in its panel - said it ""condemned the IOC for staying silent"". ""The IOC has a duty to care for its athletes. Silence is unacceptable,"" it added. The United Nations said it wanted proof of Peng's whereabouts and has urged the need for an investigation ""with full transparency"". The Lawn Tennis Association, the sport's governing body in the United Kingdom, said it has ""offered assistance"" to the WTA to ""establish the safety and wellbeing"" of Peng. Allow Twitter content?

Steve Simon disputes the Tour has put too many eggs in one basket, but there are usually 10 Chinese events a year on the WTA schedule. Many are very lucrative. The last time the WTA Finals were able to take place in Shenzhen, in 2019, there was $14m in prize money.

"A review into how to prevent migrants crossing the English Channel to the UK is to be led by Cabinet Office minister Stephen Barclay. It comes amid record numbers of people making the journey this year, withmore than 1,000 crossing in a single day earlier this month. Home Secretary Priti Patel has promised tougher action but numbers have continued to rise. It is understood Prime Minister Boris Johnson thinks more action is needed. Mr Barclay will be responsible for exploring what ministerial departments can do in an effort to make the issue more of a priority in government and the civil service. What happens to migrants who reach the UK? More than 500 migrants cross the English Channel More than 24,700 people have made the crossing from France to the UK by boat so far this year - almost three times the total of about 8,500 in 2020. Only five people have been returned to the EU so far this year. More groups of people, including children, arrived in Kent on Saturday. The numbers arriving in the latest crossings have not yet been provided by the Home Office. In an agreement signed in July, the UK pledged to give France â¬62.7m (Â£54m) during 2021-22 to help tackle the issue. The deal said the UK would help France increase police patrols along its coastline, boost aerial surveillance and increase security infrastructure at ports but record numbers of people have continued to arrive. Conservative MP Tim Loughton, a member of the Commons home affairs select committee, said France should be doing more to intercept boats. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""We know the only real solution is for the French to do what they are legally entitled but also legally obliged to do and that's to intercept the boats when they're in the water and take the passengers back to French territory."" Mr Loughton said it was ""absolutely within the power of the French to stop this miserable trade"". But Dimitris Avramopoulos, a former minister of foreign affairs for Greece and EU commissioner for migration, urged the UK and France not to blame each other and instead work together and with the European Union to secure a deal. He told Today: ""It is not easy to cope with the situation by blaming the other. I think they should immediately deepen co-operation in a spirit of mutual trust and basing their policy on the same principles."" For some time now, the government has talked tough on the idea of cracking down on small boats crossing the Channel. Ministers believe people smugglers are exploiting people who want to come to the UK to claim asylum or start a new life. Deals have been signed with France to try to deter people from making the journey in the first place. But measures so far haven't worked - this year has seen a record number of people making the dangerous journey. That's left many Conservative MPs worried and Labour criticising the government for failing to bring numbers down. The prime minister is said to want more action. But a review of what can be done cross-government won't itself solve this issue which has troubled the Home Office for years. TheDaily Telegraph,externalreported Ms Patel was planning to introduce strict new rules for asylum seekers, similar to those in Greece. The paper said the home secretary was impressed with centres being built in Greece, where migrants are put under strict curfews and face routine checks on their movements. But Mr Avramopoulos said the situation in the UK was different because its maritime borders with France are ""very complex"". On Friday, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmeraccused the government of failing to deliver on its pledges to reduce migrant Channel crossings. He said the UK had not secured ""strong"" agreements with France to prevent journeys from taking place. TheTimes reported,externalthat Conservative MPs have warned the prime minister the extent of crossings risked becoming a big electoral issue for the party. Ms Patel this week said the EU's open borders regime was partly to blame. She told reporters during a visit to the United States that she was ""constantly pressing"" the French on the issue but they were ""overwhelmed"". ""Let's not forget that the real problem on illegal migration flows is the EU has no border protections whatsoever,"" Ms Patel said. BANISH YOUR BRAIN FOG:Quick tips to boost energy this winter!

"The Tesla app is used as a key by drivers to unlock their cars Tesla drivers say they have been locked out of their cars after an outage struck the carmaker's app. Dozens of owners posted on social media about seeing an error message on the mobile app that was preventing them from connecting to their vehicles.

"Lex Greensill founded Greensill Capital, which counted former Prime Minister David Cameron as an adviser Taxpayers may be liable for up to Â£335m after a government bank failed to scrutinise collapsed lender Greensill Capital properly, MPs have said. A Public Accounts Committee report on the British Business Bank's Covid loan scheme said checks to approve the company were ""woefully inadequate"". Greensill went on to lend Â£418m to companies, 80% of which may have to be repaid by taxpayers if they default. Ex-PM David Cameron was an adviser to the lender, which collapsed in March. A government spokesman said it was not involved in the decision to accredit Greensill: ""The decision was taken independently by the British Business Bank, in accordance with their usual procedures."" Greensill had extraordinary access, says inquiry Gupta empire facing UK fraud probe over Greensill David Cameron personally promoted Greensill to investors What's the David Cameron lobbying row about? The British Business Bank was tasked with approving High Street banks and other lenders to dish out government-backed loans to embattled businesses, as Covid-19 restrictions first took hold. It was a conduit for billions of pounds in emergency lending. With help from then-adviser Mr Cameron, Greensill tried to access several government schemes, some of which were rejected. In June 2020 it was approved to lend, under two business interruption loan schemes. The vast majority of the government-guaranteed loans from Greensill went to companies within Sanjeev Gupta's steel empire GFG Alliance, and the bank eventually suspended the loan guarantees after it appeared Greensill had broken the Â£50m lending cap to groups of companies. But before it got to that point, the MPs found, different government departments and agencies were not sharing their concerns about Greensill and its main client GFG. The MPs' report pointed to issues raised with the National Crime Agency about one part of GFG Alliance, Wyelands Bank, that the Treasury and the Department for Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy (BEIS) spoke about, but did not share with the British Business Bank ""because they deemed it not to be relevant to the accreditation process despite Greensill being a significant financier to the GFG Alliance"". MPs said this ""lack of information-sharing across government"" which hampered decision-making in response to the pandemic, allowed Greensill access to taxpayer-funded schemes, thereby exposing taxpayers to a risk of Â£335m should Greensill's administrators seek repayment. The British Business Bank was also criticised for being ""insufficiently curious"" about media reports that questioned Greensill's lending model and ethical standards. In May the Serious Fraud Office opened an investigation into GFG over suspected fraudulent trading and money laundering, including its financing arrangements with Lex Greensill's company. The Conservative former prime minister David Cameron contacted various ministers on behalf of Greensill Capital The committee of MPs also said that in the government's rush to encourage lenders to funnel emergency loans to businesses it ""struck the wrong balance between making decisions quickly and protecting taxpayer interests"". ""With more time and due diligence, the bank might have reached a different decision on Greensill's accreditation,"" the MPs said. A British Business Bank spokesman said: ""The National Audit Office concluded in July 2021 that the British Business Bank appropriately applied a streamlined version of its established process when it accredited Greensill Capital (UK) Limited as a lender under the Covid-19 business support schemes. ""In the first year of the Covid-19 pandemic, the British Business Bank said it accredited 171 lenders across three schemes to provide government-backed loans for more than 1.6m businesses. ""A less streamlined accreditation process would have meant fewer lenders would have been accredited and fewer businesses would have received the critical emergency finance they needed during the pandemic,"" he added. ""The NAO also found that it was to the bank's credit that its post-accreditation monitoring and audit processes picked up a potential issue quickly, as they were designed to do"". The bank said its investigation into Greensill Capital's potential breaches of the rules is continuing, and the guarantees on repaying 80% of defaulted loans remains suspended during this probe. The committee said the bank must set out ""how it will better balance between speed of delivery and value for money in future, and what trade-offs it is prepared to accept"". Greensill collapsed earlier this year after its insurer refused to renew cover for the loans it was making.

"Unsafe toys, counterfeit clothing, and incorrectly-labelled nicotine products were taken off the street Police have seized an ""astonishing"" haul of fake designer goods and illegal items in pre-Christmas raids in London's Oxford Street. More than 17,500 items were confiscated in Operation Jade, which saw four souvenir and sweet shops raided on Thursday night. Officers took unsafe toys, counterfeit clothing, and incorrectly-labelled nicotine products off the street. An unregistered food business also had 4,000 items removed. Two bags of food with higher than the legal limit of THC - the main psychoactive compound in cannabis - were also confiscated. Heather Acton, from Westminster City Council, said shoppers needed to be able to trust the products they were buying from the busiest shopping street in London. ""The quantity and variety of goods seized by our officers is astonishing,"" she said. ""Many of these goods are unsafe and certainly unhealthy. ""From cheap imitations of fashionable products to mislabelled tobacco, and even psychoactive substances, it's vital that we protect customers and get these products off the shelves.

"Elizabeth Holmes in the California court on Wednesday An entrepreneur accused of scamming investors for millions of dollars with a bogus blood test has surprised a US court by testifying in her defence. Elizabeth Holmes is accused of making false claims about her firm Theranos, including that its technology could detect diseases with a drop of blood. Ms Holmes, 37, faces multiple charges of fraud and could spend years in jail if found guilty. She denies wrongdoing. At its peak her firm was valued at $9bn (Â£6.5bn). Taking the stand Ms Holmes said her work at Theranos had made her believe in the company's technology. She explained about how she founded the firm after dropping out of Stanford University, and how her team made an apparent technological breakthrough. ""We worked for years with teams of scientists and engineers to miniaturise all of the technologies in the laboratory,"" she told jurors. Who is Elizabeth Holmes and why is she on trial? Throughout the two-month trial, jurors in California have heard testimony from more than two dozen prosecution witnesses. They include patients and investors who prosecutors say Ms Holmes deceived. Ms Holmes rose to fame in 2013 thanks to technology she claimed could test for multiple diseases using just a few drops of blood from a finger prick. She attracted high-profile investors including Rupert Murdoch but in 2015 a whistleblower revealed the tests did not work, and the billionaire fell from grace. By 2018 Theranos had collapsed amid one of the biggest corporate scandals in recent US history. Ms Holmes has pleaded not guilty to nine counts of wire fraud and two counts of conspiracy. Her lawyers say she did not intend to defraud, but instead ""naively underestimated"" the challenges her business faced. The trial, which began in September, is expected to run until next month. It's been described as Silicon Valley's trial of the decade. Books, podcasts, even a Hollywood film has been commissioned about what happened at the company. Yet up until now it wasn't clear whether Ms Holmes would give evidence - defendants are not obliged to testify in US criminal cases. Removing her mask the jury was able to see the defendant for the first time. She smiled and spoke with confidence about the company's origins and why she wanted to help people. It's a seriously risky move for the defence, as it now opens Ms Holmes up to cross-examination. The move could be viewed as a sign of weakness, allowing the prosecution at the subject in a fraud case could backfire. But Holmes clearly believes that she can convince jurors that her intentions were honourable, and that she was unaware of Theranos' major problems. She has an awful lot on the line. If found guilty she could face up 20 years in prison.

Seth was nine weeks' premature and wrapped in a bundle of tubes, wires and an oxygen mask inside an incubator. ""It was a rollercoaster of emotions,"" said the 35-year-old. A neonatal charity is now asking for better support for parents to help them deal with the stress and strain of having an early birth. Seth, now six, is healthy and enjoying primary school, along with his brother Aron, four, who was also an early arrival. Aron arrived at 35 weeks, after two interventions by specialists when Ceri went into labour first at 27 weeks of her pregnancy. Having premature baby is a ""rollercoaster of emotions"" says the mother of Seth Roberts - born nine weeks early ""I felt the pregnancy and labour and having Seth and Aron born early, spending time in hospital, was difficult and different to my friends and family who have children,"" said Ceri, who lives with husband Elis near Bangor, Gwynedd. ""They were able to come home, people could come to the house to see them, whereas we were in hospital, with visiting hours. ""When Seth was in the high dependency unit for a couple of weeks it was only the grandparents who could come to see him. ""So that was very difficult."" Just being able to hold Seth was a special moment for Ceri and Elis Ceri and her husband spent two months living in family accommodation at the hospital. ""When I first saw Seth, he was a little bundle in a massive incubator, with all the tubes and masks and wires. It was very, very scary,"" said Ceri. ""I was over the moon that I had a son, and I wanted to share that with the world. ""But then there was the worry. Is he going to be OK? Are there any problems?"" World's most premature baby leaves hospital Premature baby 'sleeves' is viral hit Tech keeping premature baby parents in touch Hitting milestones were important. ""We celebrated when he was able to sleep without an oxygen mask, or when I was able to put clothes on them for the first time. ""Small milestones like that were massive achievements for us as a family, and for Seth."" Meeting his brother: Seth sees Aron in an incubator at Glan Clwyd Hospital Ceri praised the medical support they received for both sons but says there are wellbeing gaps for other parents with premature children. ""There aren't the parent and children clubs or baby groups for those who have been through what I've been through,"" she said. Time for Aron to leave hospital and return home with brother Seth Figures show 2,800 babies needed neonatal care in Wales in 2020. The charity Bliss said about 2,400 babies needing help are born early, which is about 8% of all births in Wales. But the charity said psychological support for parents is ""patchy"". ""When a baby is born premature or unwell and in need of neonatal care, parents often described to Bliss that their world has been turned upside down,"" said policy and research manager Josie Anderson. ""It places a huge amount of stress and anxiety on families."" Ceri and Elis Roberts' two sons are now fit. lively, young children The charity said those who have experienced a premature birth could be more likely to have post-natal depression, or develop post-traumatic stress symptoms. ""The long-term ramifications for families can be really devastating."" Bliss has been working with NSPCC Cymru to push for better mental health and wellbeing support in Wales, with the matter raised this week in the Senedd to mark World Prematurity Day. First Minister Mark Drakeford said he had seen first hand during his time serving as health minister the impact a premature birth can have on parents and it was a ""deeply distressing experience for many of them"". ""There are Royal College standards in this area, which every health board is working to meet, and where new funding has been made available by the Welsh government to assist them in doing so,"" he told the Senedd. ""Improved access to psychological therapies remains a priority for service improvement funding in this area.""

"""Serious allegations"" about Elphicke were initially passed to police in 2017 A former MP who was jailed for sexually assaulting two women said he cannot afford Â£35,000 he owes in court costs. Charlie Elphicke was handed a two year sentence in September 2020 after being found guilty of three counts of sexual assault following a trial. The former Tory MP was released after one year, but still owed the money towards the costs of the prosecution. He told Uxbridge Magistrates' Court he was unemployed and making a Universal Credit claim. ""I find myself in a very difficult and embarrassed position,"" he told magistrates, after beingsummoned to attend the courton Friday for the non-payment. ""I have no job. I have no career. I am long-term unemployed."" The former Government whip, who is on licence until next year, offered to repay his debt at Â£1 per month, but this was not accepted by the court. The court heard Elphicke received Â£51,000 from the sale of his marital home, but most of the money had been used ""in legal fees and to pay rent"". He said he had paid six months' rent up front for a one-bedroom flat, valued online at nearly Â£475,000, in Fulham, south west London, adding: ""That is why I have very limited cash to meet my living expenses."" Charlie Elphicke's wife Natalie, the MP for Dover, supported him during the trial Elphicke's claim for Universal Credit is being processed, and he told the court he had worked with the Step Change debt charity to assess his financial situation. He said he was working with the job centre and a probation officer to find a new career and must find somewhere else to live after separating with his wife Natalie Elphicke, the current MP for Dover. Magistrates agreed to adjourn the case to 17 December, allowing time for Elphicke's benefits claim to be assessed before a payment order is made. In March, he lost a Court of Appeal challenge against his jail term after his lawyers argued the sentence was too long and should have been suspended. Mrs Justice Whipple, Elphicke's sentencing judge, described him as a ""sexual predator"" who used his ""success and respectability as a cover"" and told a ""pack of lies"". During his trial, jurors heard how he had asked one of his victims about bondage and sex, then kissed her and groped her breast before chasing her around his home, chanting: ""I'm a naughty Tory.""
