"People are set to be better protected from fake reviews and ""subscription traps"" under plans to tackle rip-offs.â¯ Proposals include making it ""clearly illegal"" to pay someone to write or host fake reviews. A competition watchdog will get new powers to fine firms up to 10% of their global turnover for bad business practices. But an industry group said the new rules shouldn't put ""any further unnecessary burdens on businesses"". 'Why I write fake online reviews' UK firms caught buying five-star Google reviews The average UK household spends about Â£900 each year after being influenced by online reviews and spends Â£60 on ""unwanted subscriptions"", the government said. Under the proposed rules, there will be a new laws against offering to write and commissioning fake reviews. Websites hosting consumer reviews will have to take reasonable steps to check they are genuine. Reviews website Trustpilot said it ""welcomes legislation introduced with the aim of protecting consumers from fake reviews"". It said it is ""continually working to ensure we are taking appropriate action against attempts to manipulate reviews on our site"". Tripadvisor, a travel reviews website, said its operations ""are geared towards identifying, blocking and removing fake reviews"". ""The most direct way to protect consumers from biased and inaccurate information is to focus public policies and enforcement on the bad actors,"" said Becky Foley, senior safety director at Tripadvisor. The government also wants to bring in new rules against ""subscription traps"", in which businesses make it difficult to leave a contract. Businesses will have to give clearer information to consumers before they sign up to a subscription contract. They will need to send a reminder that a free trial or low-cost introductory offer is coming to an end, and ensure customers can leave a contract in a ""straightforward, cost-effective and timely way"", the government said. Small business minister Paul Scully said the consumers deserved better and the majority of business doing the ""right thing"" deserved ""protection from rogue traders undermining them"". ""No longer will you visit a five star-reviewed restaurant only to find a burnt lasagne or get caught in a subscription in which there's no end in sight,"" he said. If the government proposals are made into law, prepayment schemes such as Christmas savings clubs will also have to safeguard fully customers' money through insurance or trust accounts. Shoppers' savings clubs - where consumers pay for goods and services in instalments throughout the year - are not currently covered by the Financial Services Compensation Scheme. Under the proposals, even if the company goes bust, shoppers' money will still be protected. The rules aim to prevent issues such as the collapse of Christmas savings club Farepak, which saw tens of thousands of people lose money when the company went bust in 2006. The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) will be able to award compensation to consumers and directly impose financial penalties worth up to 10% of global annual turnover for businesses that transgress the new rules, or up to Â£300,000 in the case of an individual. The government said CMA's new powers will mean cases will no longer need to go through the courts. Instead, the CMA will be able to award compensation to consumers and directly impose financial penalties. Rocio Concha, Which? director of policy and advocacy, said the impact of fake reviews was ""enormous"". She said the process to ""hold businesses to account"" was ""far too complicated and lengthy"". ""Britain's consumer and competition laws are in desperate need of an upgrade,"" Ms Concha added. Kate Nicholls, chief executive of UK Hospitality, said the extra powers the CMA stands to gain would ""help stamp out the practice of fake reviews, which do irreparable damage to businesses"". However, she said the ""devil will be in the detail"" of the policy. UK Hospitality wants to see that the ""consumers are safeguarded without placing any further unnecessary burdens on businesses"". She said the new CMA powers should not ""unfairly punish businesses"" especially small businesses, adding that there needed to be ""a clear right of appeal"". ""Fairness for both businesses and consumers, particularly when it comes to offering refunds, will be crucial and any new measures must also be made in the context of a sector facing an onslaught of challenges after a difficult two years,"" she added. The government also said the CMA's powers will allow it to ""have stronger tools to tackle companies colluding to bump-up prices"" and to also stop ""killer acquisitions"" in which big businesses snap up rivals before they can launch new products or services. CMA chief executive Andrea Coscelli said the new rules were an ""important milestone towards strengthening the CMA's ability to hold companies to account, promote fair and open markets, and protect UK consumers"".

"Hayden Wood said he had put all his personal savings into Bulb The co-founder of collapsed energy firm Bulb has defended continuing to be paid Â£250,000 a year, saying he is helping with a sale of the company. Boss Hayden Wood told MPs he was asked to stay on to ""support customers"". He said he was ""very sorry"" for how the company collapsed when it buckled under rising wholesale gas prices. Bulb collapsed late last year andwas placed into ""special administration"", being run by the government through regulator Ofgem until a buyer is found. It is one of 29 suppliers which have gone bust following a sharp rise in wholesale gas prices. The Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy Committee heard the collapse of Bulb was expected to cost the taxpayer Â£3bn - which is the biggest state bailout since the Royal Bank of Scotland collapse during the 2008 financial crisis. Mr Wood told MPs the company had realised it ""couldn't afford"" losses which would have been incurred in supplying energy to customers with prices of wholesale gas reaching 400p per therm - despite having Â£120m in the bank. He said Bulb, which has 1.6 million customers, had been in discussions to raise funds and eventually to sell the company. But when talks fell through, he said: ""We had no reasonable prospect of being able to fund those losses for customers and that is when we made the difficult choice to enter special administration"". He added: ""I am very sorry for the way things turned out with Bulb. ""I think I and we at Bulb...should take responsibility for how the business failed."" Asked if it was ""morally justifiable"" that taxpayers continued to pay his salary after the company had gone bust, Mr Wood said: ""I think everything we are doing right now is to try and complete a sale of the company so that we can minimise the cost to taxpayers and minimise the disruption to consumers."" Mr Wood said he had never received a bonus from Bulb, had put all his personal savings into the company he created in 2015 and had since lost all his shareholdings in the firm. At the time Bulb was placed in special administration, the Treasury set aside Â£1.7bn to purchase the gas required until the end of the tax year in April 2022 by which time it had been hoped a buyer would be found for the business. But government officials have conceded that the prospect of offloading the business to a private buyer seems remote in the current environment and that means that taxpayers will foot the bill. A Department for Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy spokesperson said: ""Bulb's administrators have agreed to keep Mr Wood temporarily in place to ensure a smooth handover and sales process."" ""Mr Wood is paid for this work under his employment contract with Simple Energy, the parent company of Bulb, in a separate administration process over which the government has no influence. The spokesperson added that the government will seek to recoup administration costsâ¯at a later date. Jake Brown headed up Avro which had 580,000 customers when it collapsed The committee also quizzed Jake Brown, chief executive of now-collapsed firm Avro, which had 580,000 customers. Mr Brown faced questions about loans his family business took out of the firm, as well as his failures to engage with regulators and energy charities. Avro's collapse is expected to cost Â£700m. The committee chair said Mr Brown had appeared to have got off ""pretty lightly"" when customers were now having to foot the bill for his business going bust. Labour MP Darren Jones added Mr Brown ""personified"" the reason the government needed to change energy market regulation and said he ""took customer money out the business"". ""In my view you should have never been allowed to start an energy company. I find it quite offensive that you have ended up with so much of customers' money,"" he said. Mr Brown told MPs he had a ""lot of regret"" that that company had gone bust and claimed he ""had not touched any customers' money"". Rescue of Bulb set to cost taxpayers billions more Energy firm Bulb set to go into administration Earlier during the committee meeting, the bosses of four major energy firms called on the government to do more to help people struggling with soaring energy bills. Keith Anderson, chief executive of Scottish Power, told MPs ""so many people are really going to struggle"" after prices rose by 54% from 1 April. But he warned further rises forecast in October were going to be ""horrific"". E.ON boss Michael Lewis said efforts by the government to soften the blow of higher prices were ""not nearly enough"". Scottish Power's Mr Anderson spoke to MPs alongside E.ON's Mr Lewis, Simone Rossi the chief executive of EDF, and Chris O' Shea the boss of British Gas owner Centrica. Mr Anderson said his company had 8,000 calls with concerns about paying bills since the price for a household using a typical amount of gas and electricity increased by Â£693 on average - from Â£1,277 to Â£1,971 per year - at the start of April. But he said his biggest concern was when prices are due to rise again in October, ""particularly around the most vulnerable and poorest"". ""In summer consumption goes down. Come October that's going to get horrific, totally horrific,"" he said. How high could my energy bills go? Bill shock for millions as energy price rise hits Mr Anderson said the energy price crisis had now ""got to the stage now where I believe the size and scale of this is beyond what I can deal with, it's beyond what I think this industry can deal with"". The Scottish Power boss said the government should set up a ""deficit fund"" and wipe Â£1,000 off the bill of anyone who is deemed to be in fuel poverty and on pre-payment meters, which would be repaid by all customers or the government. Mr Anderson said such a policy was required for people in fuel poverty that ""puts their bill back to where it used to be before the gas crisis"". But he said in the future the government should scrap the energy price cap -  the maximum price suppliers in England, Wales and Scotland can charge households - and introduce a ""social tariff"". He said a social tariff would be ""targeted to discount the price"" to people in fuel poverty. Mr Lewis, chief executive of E.ON, supported the idea of a social tariff but said the government could do more in the short-term situation which he said was something he had ""never"" seen in his 30-year career. He said if the government did not provide more support for households, E.ON forecast 30-40% of its customers would ""go into fuel poverty"". To date, the government has said it will offer extra relief of Â£150 via the council tax system in England in April and in October customers in England, Scotland and Wales will receive a Â£200 rebate on their energy bills. They will have to repay this at Â£40 a year for five years, starting in April 2023. The warm house discount scheme is also being expanded to cover three million households. It offers low income households a one-off annual discount on their electricity bill, and was worth Â£140 in 2021-22. Mr Rossi added the government support for bill payers announced in February was ""proportionate at that point"", but added things had got worse as a result of the war in Ukraine. Meanwhile, Mr O'Shea said 10% of Centrica customers - about 716,000 households - were in Â£440 of debt on average compared to 125,000 at this time last year. He said the insolvency service ""should pursue managers, the directors, the executives of every failed company"". ""Those that have misbehaved should feel the full force of the law,"" he added.

"A new series of Stranger Things will air in May Netflix has hinted it will crack down on households sharing passwords as it seeks to sign up new members following a sharp fall in subscribers. The number of households using the streaming service fell by 200,000 in the first three months of the year as it faced stiff competition from rivals. It was also hit after it raised prices in some countries and left Russia. Netflix warned shareholders another two million subscribers were likely to leave in the three months to July. ""Our revenue growth has slowed considerably,"" the firm told shareholders on Tuesday after publishing its first quarter results. ""Our relatively high household penetration - when including the large number of households sharing accounts - combined with competition, is creating revenue growth headwinds."" The streaming giant estimates more than 100 million households watch the service for free using shared passwords. Boss Reed Hastings previously described the practice as ""something you have to learn to live with"", adding that much of it is ""legitimate"" between family members. The firm also said account sharing had probably fuelled its growth by getting more people using Netflix. Households cancel streaming services to cut costs Bridgerton gets third and fourth series on Netflix But on Tuesday, Mr Hastings said it was making it hard to attract new subscribers in some countries. ""When we were growing fast, it wasn't a high priority to work on [account sharing]. And now we're working super hard on it,"" he told shareholders. The firm said payment plans it is testing to curb password sharing in Latin America could be rolled out to other countries. Since last month, account holders in Chile, Costa Rica and Peru must pay to add user profiles for people outside their household (the company currently allows people who live together to share their Netflix account). Users can add up to two extra profiles for $2-$3 (Â£1.53-Â£2.30) a month each, on top of their regular fee. Netflix - which did not say how it would enforce the rule - said it was seeking a ""customer centric"" solution. ""The principle way we have is asking our members to pay a bit more to share the service outside their homes,"" said Greg Peters, Netflix's chief product officer. Dominic Sunnebo, an analyst at research firm Kantar, warned the plan could backfire at a time when consumers were looking for ways to save money. ""If the schemes to counter password sharing move too fast and too aggressively, it also risks alienating a potential future audience - many who password-share beyond the household are not actually aware they're breaking the terms of their subscription."" Netflix said that pulling out of Russia in March in response to the Ukraine war had cost it 700,000 subscribers. And another 600,000 people stopped using its service in the US and Canada after it put up prices in January. The firm raised prices across all of its US plans, with a basic plan increasing from $9 to $10 per month, and a standard from $14 to $15.50. In the UK, basic and standard plans have both increased by Â£1 a month to Â£6.99 and Â£10.99 respectively. Netflix said the price rises would yield more money for the firm, despite the cancellations. But analysts say the rising cost of streaming services is wearing on households as the cost of living rises. In the UK,households cancelled more than 1.5 million streaming subscriptions in the first three months of the year, with 38% saying they wanted to save money. One of Netflix most popular series, Bridgerton, launched its second series last month Seeming to acknowledge this, Mr Hastings said Netflix was looking at launching a free ad-supported service like its rivals Disney and HBO. Analysts say it could open a significant new revenue stream for the company, which has so far shunned advertising. ""Those who have followed Netflix know that I've been against the complexity of advertising, and a big fan of the simplicity of subscription,"" he said. ""But, as much as I'm a fan of that, I'm a bigger fan of consumer choice."" Netflix's biggest threat is intense competition from firms such as Amazon, Apple and Disney, which are pouring money into their online streaming services, according to experts. Paolo Pescatore, an analyst at PP Foresight, said Netflix's subscriber loss was a ""reality check"", as it tries to balance retaining subscribers with raising its revenue.

Shares in the streaming giant plunged in early trade in New York on Wednesday, dropping more than 30% off the back of the update. The firm - which remains the world's leading streaming service with more than 220 million subscribers - had enjoyed uninterrupted quarterly growth in subscribers since October 2011. However, it said a surge in sign-ups during the pandemic had ""obscured"" the real picture around its growth. It made revenue of $7.8bn (Â£6bn) in the first three months of the year, up 9.8% compared with the same period last year.

"The war in Ukraine will ""severely set back"" the global economic recovery with the UK hit harder than most, the International Monetary Fund has said. The conflict is driving up prices for food and fuel which the international body expects to slow growth globally. It has cut its global forecast and also downgraded its outlook for the UK. This means the UK will no longer be the fastest growing economy in the G7 group of leading Western nations, and will be the slowest in 2023, it says. The body says that UK growth will slow as price pressures lead households to cut spending, while rising interest rates are expected to ""cool investment"". The UK's economy is now predicted to grow by 3.7% this year, down from the previous forecast of 4.7% made in January. However, next year, the UK is expected to have the slowest growth in the G7 and across Europe's main economies, at just 1.2%, a near halving from the 2.3% expected previously. The 2023 UK figure is the slowest apart from heavily-sanctioned Russia in the wider G20 grouping, which includes nations such as China and India. The IMF said that the UK was the fastest growing G7 economy in 2021, and is forecast to be the second fastest in 2022. The low UK growth rates forecast in 2023 are in part due to the UK rebounding more quickly from the pandemic than some of its G7 peers. However, the UK is also wrestling with high inflation, which will hit growth in 2023, as people cut spending as their real income shrinks, the IMF said. The organisation expects inflation to peak in late 2022 at 9%. It said rising interest rates will also slow the UK economy in 2023 and 2023, while government policies such as getting rid of certain tax breaks will reduce business investment at that time. In addition, Brexit will hold back export growth, the IMF said, and it will continue to make pandemic-related labour supply ""scarring"" worse by reducing immigration. ""However, the impact of Brexit is spread over several years and is not the primary driver of the slowdown in 2023,"" a spokesperson for the organisation added. The IMF works with its 189 member countriesto try to stabilise the global economy, including issuing short-term loans and assistance to countries who are struggling. It said inflation was now a ""clear and present danger"" in many countries and the situation has added to supply strains from the coronavirus pandemic. ""In the matter of a few weeks, the world has yet again experienced a major, transformative shock,"" IMF director of research Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas wrote in the organisation's 2022 World Economic Outlook. ""Just as a durable recovery from the pandemic-induced global economic collapse appeared in sight, the war has created the very real prospect that a large part of the recent gains will be erased."" The organisation said it expected global growth of just 3.6% this year, down nearly a percentage point from its forecast before the war. Price rises fastest for 30 years as petrol soars China spending and employment hit amid lockdowns Ukraine war causes 'giant leap' in food prices The World Bank also said it was lowering its growth forecast from 4.1% to 3.2%. The conflict has already devastated the economies of Ukraine and Russia, which the West cut off from key trade and financial networks with sanctions following the invasion. Ukraine is facing a severe contraction of 35% or more this year, while Russia's economy is expected to shrink by 8.5%, the IMF said. But with Russia a major energy producer and key supplier of staples such as wheat and corn alongside Ukraine, the consequences will ripple far beyond their borders, the IMF warned. There have been two acute shocks to the world economy in quick succession - the pandemic and the Ukraine war. The latter is building on the problems created by the former, tripping up what had been a healthy recovery, and sending prices rising at an even faster rate. Food and energy prices were already being hiked by the supply bottlenecks after the pandemic, before one of the world's biggest energy suppliers invaded one of the world's biggest food exporter. But now there are new bottlenecks emerging from the stringent Covid lockdowns in some regions of China. Rising prices risk social stability in poorer countries, dependent on food imports. Fears about inflation becoming entrenched are leading the world's central bankers to raise interest rates. In turn that is raising the cost of borrowing for the record debts many nations racked up during the pandemic. So all this requires some skill and cooperation among the old and new financial powerhouses of the world. But that has been another commodity in short supply in recent times. ""The economic effects of the war are spreading far and wide - like seismic waves that emanate from the epicenter of an earthquake,"" it said. In Germany, where the economy is especially closely entwined, the war is likely to lower growth by 1.7 percentage points, it said. Even in countries with little direct trade with Russia and Ukraine, households will feel the effects of the war, as central banks respond to the more rapid inflation by raising interest rates, making borrowing more expensive, the IMF said. In the US, for example, the organisation lowered its forecast for growth in 2022 by 0.3 percentage points to 3.7%, citing the prospect of more aggressive interest rate rises. Ukraine and Russia accounted for nearly 30% of the world's wheat Overall, inflation pressures are significantly worse than they were when the IMF issued its previous forecast in January. It now predicts inflation in ""advanced economies"" will hit 5.7% this year, while it is likely to reach 8.7% in emerging markets. UK inflation is expected to be 5.3% next year - the highest in the G7, and higher than all EU members, and only exceeded in the G20 by crisis-ridden Argentina, Turkey and Russia. ""Inflation has become a clear and present danger for many countries,"" Mr Gourinchas wrote in a blog. A few countries, such as oil exporters, are benefiting. The IMF expects growth in Saudi Arabia, for example, to be stronger than it did in January. But the risks are not purely economic, the IMF added. It said the war had also created a refugee crisis and aggravated political tensions, risking a ""more permanent fragmentation of the world economy into geopolitical blocks with distinct technology standards, cross-border payment systems, and reserve currencies"". ""Such a 'tectonic shift' would cause long-run efficiency losses, increase volatility and represent a major challenge to the rules-based framework that has governed international and economic relations for the last 75 years,"" the IMF said. A Treasury spokesperson said the IMF forecasts ""will be concerning for many people and families"" in the UK. ""However the support we provided over the past two years has put our economy in a good position to deal with these headwinds, including through record numbers of employees on payrolls and a strong economic recovery from the pandemic,"" the spokesperson said. Labour's shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves said the IMF forecast ""shows the extreme challenges facing the UK economy"". ""While it is true that global forces play a role, the fact that the UK is forecast to have the slowest growth of any G7 economy next year plus the highest inflation, shows the uniquely bad situation the UK is in. ""Inflation spiralling out of control this year has created a cost of living crisis hitting families across the country, needing decisive and urgent action,"" she said, repeating Labour calls for a windfall tax on oil and gas firms. Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesperson Christine Jardine said the UK government had ""failed to shield the UK from spiralling energy bills and soaring inflation, but they have gone ahead with raising people's taxes to their highest point in 70 years"".

"The prices of fridges, freezers and dishwashers are up by a third since last year and set to climb higher, the boss of a white goods retailer says. Nick Glynne from Buy It Direct, which owns Appliances Direct, blamed Covid lockdowns in China, shortages of materials and sky-high shipping costs. Amdea, a UK appliance maker trade association, said wholesale prices had risen by nine per cent in three months. Retailers AO World and Currys also said their prices had been impacted. It comes as the UK's cost of living rises at its fastest rate since 1992, with petrol and energy costs soaring. Mr Glynne said Appliances Direct, which he says has an 8% share of the UK appliance market, was facing much higher wholesale costs which it was forced to pass on to customers. Shoppers are paying about 30% more than a year ago for fridges, range cookers and dishwashers, he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. ""If you look at a large American fridge freezer that we bring in over from China, pre-Covid that cost around Â£12 to ship, Â£12 door-to-door from a factory in northern China across to the UK and that would take six months lead time,"" he said. ""Now we're looking at 12-14 months lead time and the price for freight alone has gone up to around Â£80 for that unit. So a Â£299 fridge has now got a Â£70 increase in cost, which has a knock on effect to the consumer."" In November, rival electrical goods retailer AO World said that its prices had climbed by 10-12% due to supply chain pressures. A spokesperson told the BBC on Tuesday: ""There are inflationary pressures in the market such as shipping costs, material input prices and consumer price inflation which inevitably affects the price of electrical products. We don't expect that to change through the rest of this year."" Lara Brittain, white goods category director at Currys said: ""We are seeing increased costs with logistics being the main issue, however the availability of raw materials and components is also playing a part. ""We work closely with our supplier partners to ensure we are giving our customers the best value, but unfortunately there is some impact to product pricing."" Mr Glynne said appliance prices are likely to rise further this year as retailers are still selling stock bought last year. ""Our replacement stock is getting more expensive,"" he told the BBC. ""It is going to get worse this year rather than get better. Consumers may think they'll get bargain by waiting but they won't."" He said that Buy It Direct, which also owns Laptops Direct and Furniture 123, had laid off 150 of its 1,000 staff this year in ""anticipation of a slowdown"" in consumer spending. Why are prices rising so quickly? Biggest squeeze for public sector pay in 20 years Mr Glynne's warnings follow research in February from price comparison site Price Runner, which found that prices of white goods and gadgets had soared by nearly 50% in just two years. It said the average price of a washing machine was up by 46%, or Â£152, between January 2020 and February 2022, and a tumble dryer by Â£70. But the research, which looked at thousands of goods, found some products such as dishwashers had fallen slightly. Most bulky white goods are made in China, but Mr Glynne said recent strict lockdowns in cities like Shanghai had hit factories, meaning it was harder for the UK to source products. He added that manufacturers also faced worsening shortages of commodities such as electrical steel, in part because of the Ukraine war, while freight shipping costs remained high due to the pandemic. The UK's cost of living climbed by 7% in the 12 months to March, up from 6.2% in February, official figures show.

Its customers are also spending less amid concerns about inflation and Ukraine. ""The customer has definitely held back in the short term financially,"" Susanne Given said. She added that the economic backdrop meant that, however big a customer's budget, they were still hesitant about spending.

"Iby Knill often spoke to young people about her experiences during the Holocaust An ""incredible"" Holocaust survivor has died 77 years after her liberation from a concentration camp. Iby Knill, 98, died on Easter Sunday, the same day she was freed from the Auschwitz-Birkenau camp in Nazi-occupied Poland in April 1945. Mrs Knill had escaped to Hungary from Czechoslovakia earlier in World War Two, but was sent to the camp in 1944. She was born in 1923 in what is now the Czech Republic and she moved to the UK after the war, living in Leeds. She had married Bert Knill, a British soldier, in 1946 after her liberation from Auschwitz-Birkenau. This video can not be played Holocaust survivor Iby Knill talks about her experiences in the Auschwitz-Birkenau camp About six million Jewish men, women and children, along with members of other groups, were murdered during the Holocaust by Germany's Nazi regime and its collaborators in World War Two. In Auschwitz, Mrs Knill was initially selected for forced labour. In a BBC interview, she said she got through her captivity in the concentration camp by ""staying together"" with her four friends and ""living one day at a time"". In the final days of the war, hundreds of the camp's prisoners were forced on a death march. They were liberated by the American army on Easter Sunday, 1945. Mrs Knill went on to become a well-known speaker and author about the Holocaust and received a British Empire Medal in the Queen's Honours list in 2017. She wrote a two-volume autobiography, The Woman Without a Number and The Woman With Nine Lives, and often told her story to young people to educate them about the Holocaust. Iby Knill had a ""positive mental attitude"", her publisher Phil Caplan said Phil Caplan, of Scratching Shed Publishing, which published her autobiography, said: ""It is the irony of ironies that Easter Sunday was also the day she was liberated. That circular event in history has added more poignancy. ""She was incredible. To be in her presence was to be overwhelmed with her view of humanity when she could have borne the strongest of grudges."" Mr Caplan said Mrs Knill ""had a positive mental attitude and refused to give in"". ""She wasn't pinned down to one belief, she was a humanist more than anything. She related to young people and that kept her going,"" he added. Among other tributes to Mrs Knill, Frank Gardner, the BBC's security correspondent, said: ""Her spirit was indomitable.""

""She was passionate about sharing her testimony and ensuring the next generation learnt about the horrors of the Holocaust. ""Our thoughts are with her family and friends at this sad time."" Fabian Hamilton, who was Mrs Knill's MP and knew her well, added: ""What a stalwart, a completely remarkable women. ""She didn't start talking about her wartime experiences till about 20 years ago but often spoke of how she had stuck together with her friends as had there been any sense of being on your own that person would be picked off.

"Uranus, photographed here by the Hubble Space Telescope, has at least 13 rings and numerous moons The US space agency Nasa should prioritise a mission to Uranus, an influential panel of scientists says. The ""ice giant"" is the seventh planet in our Solar System, orbiting the Sun 19 times further out than the Earth. It's only ever been visited once before, in a brief flyby by the Voyager-2 probe in 1986. Researchers think an in-depth study of Uranus can help them better understand the many similarly sized objects now being discovered around other stars. The recommendation is madein a document,externalpublished by the US National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (NAS). Known as a ""decadal survey"", it is the summation of what the American research community thinks are the big planetary science questions right now and the space missions required to answer them. Nasa has broadly followed the recommendations of previous National Academies reports. The last planetary decadal survey,external, published in 2011, had as its two top priorities a rock-collection mission to Mars, which became thePerseverance rover, now on the surface of the Red Planet; and a mission to Jupiter and its moon Europa, which is currently being prepared for launch in 2024. This is called theEuropa Clipperspacecraft. The closest we've been to Uranus is with the Voyager-2 mission Discovered by Sir William Herschel in 1781 Average distance from the Sun is 3 billion km It circles the Sun once every 84 Earth years Its diameter is four times that of our planet Hydrogen and helium dominate the atmosphere It has at least 13 rings and numerous moons Specialists who study the outer planets in our Solar System have been campaigning for a return visit to either Uranus or Neptune ever since their late-80s Voyager-2 encounters. And the science case has only strengthened over the intervening years, proponents argue. Look at the size-range of planets now being discovered around other stars and they seem to dominate in a range that's about three and four times the width of the Earth. That's Uranus and Neptune. ""And that actually poses a problem for planet formation theories,"" explained Prof Leigh Fletcher, who contributed to the report. ""We think we understand how something gets as big as Jupiter, and we think we understand how something gets to be the size of Earth and Venus. But in the middle, in that kind of sweet spot between those end-members - we don't fully understand how a world can start to grow and grow and not just carry on to become Jupiter-mass in size. A mission to Uranus could help us answer that,"" the Leicester University, UK, scientist told BBC News. Artwork: European scientists will hope they can join the mission, just as they did with the Cassini mission to Saturn There are favourable launch opportunities in 2031 and 2032 that would allow a spacecraft to use a gravity slingshot around Jupiter to shorten the cruise time to Uranus to ""just"" 13 years. The spacecraft would go into orbit around the planet, which would preclude any observations at the more-distant Neptune. The eighth and outermost planet will have to wait its turn. Uranus is an oddity compared with the other planets in the Solar System in that its axis of rotation is almost parallel with the plane of its orbit around the Sun. It's as if it has been knocked on to its side, which may well be the explanation - scientists speculate that it suffered a massive impact with another body early in its history. Uranus has rings and plenty of moons. Indeed, the moons are quite a draw because a good many of them are likely to be ""ocean worlds"". ""This is the idea that you've got an icy crust and then you've got some kind of liquid briny ocean down at depth that may or may not be in contact with whatever silicate rocky material is down at the bottom,"" said Prof Fletcher. ""Well, all of the big five classical satellites of Uranus are thought of as being ocean world candidates. These moons could have cryo-volcanic (ice volcano) activity taking place on them."" The successful completion of the Perseverance rover's mission comes before all else Dr Robin Canup from the Southwest Research Institute in Boulder, Colorado, was the co-chair on the Academies' steering committee. She said an ice giant was a worthy target for a Nasa flagship and of all the potential candidates assessed in what would be the most expensive class of endeavour, the Uranus mission was the most mature technically. ""It was the only one to receive a low-medium rating for its risk,"" she explained. ""So because of that, we are extremely excited to recommend that the highest priority new flagship should be a Uranus orbiter and probe. This will be a fantastic multi-year mission with the probe dropping into the planet at the beginning of the mission, followed by an extended orbital tour investigating the satellites, their interiors, the magnetosphere, the rings, and the atmosphere. ""It is technically ready to start now. We recommend that it be initiated in financial year 2024."" European-based planetary researchers, like Prof Fletcher, will be hoping the European Space Agency (Esa) can contribute to such a mission. Nasa and Esa are frequent partners, such as onthe Cassini-Huygens mission to Saturn (2004-2017), but their priorities and funding cycles do not always coincide. And for Nasa, the speed at which it's able to implement the recommendation will depend on its other financial commitments. The decadal survey panel said completing the Perseverance rover's objectives and the follow-up missions designed to bring its rock samples back to Earth came before everything else in importance.

"President Volodymyr Zelensky said a ""large part of the entire Russian army"" is now focused on the Donbas offensive Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky has said Russia has launched an assault to seize the eastern Donbas region. Russian and Ukrainian forces clashed on Tuesday along the eastern front line, after Mr Zelensky said the battle for the Donbas had begun. Ukraine's top security official, Oleksiy Danilov, said Russia was trying break through Ukrainian defensive positions throughout Ukraine's east. The offensive had been expected after Russia failed to seize Kyiv. After its push to overrun the capital stalled, Moscow announced its military would focus instead on eastern Ukraine where Russian-backed separatists have been fighting Ukrainian forces since 2014. Luhansk is one of the most fiercely contested regions, and on Tuesday its Governor Serhiy Hayday said it had come under attack from all sides. He announced that street fighting in the city of Kreminna had forced Ukrainian troops to withdraw and regroup, leaving Russian forces in control of the eastern city of 18,000. ""They moved in but our defenders had to retreat,"" Mr Hayday said. ""The enemy was shelling every metre of our defence line."" The strategic port city of Mariupol, meanwhile, has come under intense bombardment. Pro-Russian forces have reportedly begun an attempt to storm the city's Azovstal steelworks, where Mariupol's final defenders have been holding out for days. Ukraine says civilians and children are among those holed up in the complex, but pro-Russian officials in the city have disputed this. Mariupol is a key Russian target which if captured would allow its troops to complete a land-bridge between the occupied Crimean peninsula and separatist held regions of eastern Ukraine. Two Kharkiv residents react after a fresh wave of Russian shelling targeted the city In Kharkiv, which is 400km (249 miles) away in Ukraine's north-east, officials said three people had been killed and 21 injured in a new wave of attacks on the city. ""The intensity of the shelling of Kharkiv has increased,"" the regional governor Oleg Sinegubov said in a post on Telegram. Russia initially appeared to want to capture major Ukrainian cities and topple the country's government. But after facing stiff resistance, Russian defence officials said that its main objectives in the ""first stage of the operation"" had been ""generally accomplished"" and its forces were moved from areas around the capital. They announced plans to redirect the focus of the invasion towards the ""liberation"" of the mostly Russian-speaking Donbas region. Russia's President Vladmir Putin has portrayed the invasion as an attempt to demilitarise and ""denazify"" Ukraine, something Ukraine and its allies dismiss as a ruse for an unprovoked attack. Russian defence officials said its forces struck more than 1,200 targets in Ukraine on Monday night, including 25 military command posts in Mykolayiv and Kirovsk as well as two weapon depots in east Ukraine. Describing the fresh offensive in a television interview, Moscow's Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said ""another stage of this operation is beginning, and I'm sure this will be a very important moment."" First civilian deaths in Lviv shatter sense of safety Ukrainian leaders say Mariupol defenders will fight to the end Sunken Russian warship Moskva: What do we know? Speaking in a video message on Monday night, Mr Zelensky said that his forces had pledged to ""not give up anything Ukrainian"". ""A very large part of the entire Russian army is now focused on this offensive,"" he added, but said that Ukraine's forces will fight on ""no matter how many Russian troops are driven there, we will fight"". Moscow claimed last month that it controlled 93% of Luhansk and 54% of Donetsk and its forces are expected to try and encircle the remaining Ukrainian troops in the region. But they face a protracted fight with some of Kyiv's most battle-hardened troops. Ukraine is believed to have between 40-50,000 soldiers in the Donbas, many of whom have spent years fighting against Russian-backed separatists forces in the region. Ukraine is believed to have thousands of experienced troops in the Donbas The change in Russia's objectives was set out by President Vladimir Putin during a speech last week, where he announced that his aim was ""to help the people who live in the Donbas, who feel their unbreakable bond with Russia"". The Pentagon's press secretary, John Kirby, cautioned Russia could be ""setting the conditions for future offensive operations"" and officials in Kyiv warned that the new Russian offensive does not mean that Moscow has ended its attacks on other parts of Ukraine. ""Putin hasn't removed the goal to destroy us as a state and our political leadership,"" Mr Danilov said in an interview with Ukrainian TV.

"Hayden Wood said he had put all his personal savings into Bulb The co-founder of collapsed energy firm Bulb has defended continuing to be paid Â£250,000 a year, saying he is helping with a sale of the company. Boss Hayden Wood told MPs he was asked to stay on to ""support customers"". He said he was ""very sorry"" for how the company collapsed when it buckled under rising wholesale gas prices. Bulb collapsed late last year andwas placed into ""special administration"", being run by the government through regulator Ofgem until a buyer is found. It is one of 29 suppliers which have gone bust following a sharp rise in wholesale gas prices. The Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy Committee heard the collapse of Bulb was expected to cost the taxpayer Â£3bn - which is the biggest state bailout since the Royal Bank of Scotland collapse during the 2008 financial crisis. Mr Wood told MPs the company had realised it ""couldn't afford"" losses which would have been incurred in supplying energy to customers with prices of wholesale gas reaching 400p per therm - despite having Â£120m in the bank. He said Bulb, which has 1.6 million customers, had been in discussions to raise funds and eventually to sell the company. But when talks fell through, he said: ""We had no reasonable prospect of being able to fund those losses for customers and that is when we made the difficult choice to enter special administration"". He added: ""I am very sorry for the way things turned out with Bulb. ""I think I and we at Bulb...should take responsibility for how the business failed."" Asked if it was ""morally justifiable"" that taxpayers continued to pay his salary after the company had gone bust, Mr Wood said: ""I think everything we are doing right now is to try and complete a sale of the company so that we can minimise the cost to taxpayers and minimise the disruption to consumers."" Mr Wood said he had never received a bonus from Bulb, had put all his personal savings into the company he created in 2015 and had since lost all his shareholdings in the firm. At the time Bulb was placed in special administration, the Treasury set aside Â£1.7bn to purchase the gas required until the end of the tax year in April 2022 by which time it had been hoped a buyer would be found for the business. But government officials have conceded that the prospect of offloading the business to a private buyer seems remote in the current environment and that means that taxpayers will foot the bill. A Department for Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy spokesperson said: ""Bulb's administrators have agreed to keep Mr Wood temporarily in place to ensure a smooth handover and sales process."" ""Mr Wood is paid for this work under his employment contract with Simple Energy, the parent company of Bulb, in a separate administration process over which the government has no influence. The spokesperson added that the government will seek to recoup administration costsâ¯at a later date. Jake Brown headed up Avro which had 580,000 customers when it collapsed The committee also quizzed Jake Brown, chief executive of now-collapsed firm Avro, which had 580,000 customers. Mr Brown faced questions about loans his family business took out of the firm, as well as his failures to engage with regulators and energy charities. Avro's collapse is expected to cost Â£700m. The committee chair said Mr Brown had appeared to have got off ""pretty lightly"" when customers were now having to foot the bill for his business going bust. Labour MP Darren Jones added Mr Brown ""personified"" the reason the government needed to change energy market regulation and said he ""took customer money out the business"". ""In my view you should have never been allowed to start an energy company. I find it quite offensive that you have ended up with so much of customers' money,"" he said. Mr Brown told MPs he had a ""lot of regret"" that that company had gone bust and claimed he ""had not touched any customers' money"". Rescue of Bulb set to cost taxpayers billions more Energy firm Bulb set to go into administration Earlier during the committee meeting, the bosses of four major energy firms called on the government to do more to help people struggling with soaring energy bills. Keith Anderson, chief executive of Scottish Power, told MPs ""so many people are really going to struggle"" after prices rose by 54% from 1 April. But he warned further rises forecast in October were going to be ""horrific"". E.ON boss Michael Lewis said efforts by the government to soften the blow of higher prices were ""not nearly enough"". Scottish Power's Mr Anderson spoke to MPs alongside E.ON's Mr Lewis, Simone Rossi the chief executive of EDF, and Chris O' Shea the boss of British Gas owner Centrica. Mr Anderson said his company had 8,000 calls with concerns about paying bills since the price for a household using a typical amount of gas and electricity increased by Â£693 on average - from Â£1,277 to Â£1,971 per year - at the start of April. But he said his biggest concern was when prices are due to rise again in October, ""particularly around the most vulnerable and poorest"". ""In summer consumption goes down. Come October that's going to get horrific, totally horrific,"" he said. How high could my energy bills go? Bill shock for millions as energy price rise hits Mr Anderson said the energy price crisis had now ""got to the stage now where I believe the size and scale of this is beyond what I can deal with, it's beyond what I think this industry can deal with"". The Scottish Power boss said the government should set up a ""deficit fund"" and wipe Â£1,000 off the bill of anyone who is deemed to be in fuel poverty and on pre-payment meters, which would be repaid by all customers or the government. Mr Anderson said such a policy was required for people in fuel poverty that ""puts their bill back to where it used to be before the gas crisis"". But he said in the future the government should scrap the energy price cap -  the maximum price suppliers in England, Wales and Scotland can charge households - and introduce a ""social tariff"". He said a social tariff would be ""targeted to discount the price"" to people in fuel poverty. Mr Lewis, chief executive of E.ON, supported the idea of a social tariff but said the government could do more in the short-term situation which he said was something he had ""never"" seen in his 30-year career. He said if the government did not provide more support for households, E.ON forecast 30-40% of its customers would ""go into fuel poverty"". To date, the government has said it will offer extra relief of Â£150 via the council tax system in England in April and in October customers in England, Scotland and Wales will receive a Â£200 rebate on their energy bills. They will have to repay this at Â£40 a year for five years, starting in April 2023. The warm house discount scheme is also being expanded to cover three million households. It offers low income households a one-off annual discount on their electricity bill, and was worth Â£140 in 2021-22. Mr Rossi added the government support for bill payers announced in February was ""proportionate at that point"", but added things had got worse as a result of the war in Ukraine. Meanwhile, Mr O'Shea said 10% of Centrica customers - about 716,000 households - were in Â£440 of debt on average compared to 125,000 at this time last year. He said the insolvency service ""should pursue managers, the directors, the executives of every failed company"". ""Those that have misbehaved should feel the full force of the law,"" he added.

"Civil servants must stop working from home and return to the office to ensure government buildings are at full capacity, ministers have been told. Cabinet Office minister Jacob Rees-Mogg has written to cabinet colleagues urging them to send a ""clear message"" to the civil service about returning. The FDA union said his comments were out of step with practice in the private sector. Average daily attendance in the week of 4 April was 44%, figures show. The government's recommendation for people to work from homeended in January, after being reintroduced in the face of the emergence of the Omicron variant last year. But Mr Rees-Mogg - who also has the role of government efficiencies minister as part of his brief - said there was ""much further to go"" to reach pre-pandemic levels. The prime minister's official spokesman said it was right to push for a return to pre-pandemic levels of occupancy. He said it was not just about ""value-for-money"" for taxpayer-funded buildings but also of benefit to staff - particularly junior staff, whose career development can be hampered by a lack of face-to-face working, the government believes. Should I be working from home now? What will Jacob Rees-Mogg do in his new job? In a letter to the heads of government departments dated 13 April, seen by the BBC, he urged cabinet ministers to ""review any guidance within your departments that sets an expectation of the minimum number of days in the office per week."" He also sent a league table of daily civil service office attendance from the week beginning on 4 April, which shows in some departments daily average of staff in the workplace was lower than a third. The Department for Education had the lowest office attendance at 25% of current daily capacity, while the Department for International Trade was highest at 73%. The average across all departments in the same week was 44%, according to the figures. Mr Rees-Mogg said he planned to continue visiting departments with lower attendance figures to ""ensure we are making efficient use of the central London estate"". Dave Penman, the general secretary of the FDA which represents senior civil servants, said the move was ""vindictive"" and accused ministers of acting like ""luddites"". He said there was ""no rationale"" for it, arguing that ministers ""couldn't point to productivity losses"" and were obsessed with micro-managing the civil service. Some senior Tory MPs have also called for more to be done to encourage civil servants back to their workplaces. Sir Graham Brady, chairman of the backbench 1922 committee, wrote at the weekend: ""It is simply unacceptable for so many of our public servants to continue sitting at home."" Asked about the letter, a government spokeswoman said: ""Ministers have been clear that departments should make maximum use of office space and progress is being monitored."" However, some have suggested forcing civil servants to return to the office may be counter-productive. In areport from February,external, the Institute for Government think tank argued offering hybrid working has key benefits to help the government achieve its agenda and said the government would be wrong to force a return to full-time office work.

The Biden administration is planning to announce another $800m (Â£615m) military aid package for Ukraine, according to US media. Asked on Tuesday in Portsmouth, New Hampshire, if he would send more artillery to Ukraine, President Biden responded: ""Yes."" The White House last week announced it would sent an $800m package to Ukraine that includes 40,000 artillery rounds and 18 howitzers (155mm). Speaking at a domestic event in the US state of New Hampshire, President Joe Biden said that he's not sure whether he'll travel to Ukraine. âThe answer is, I donât know,â Biden told reporters, according to CNN. âIâve been to Ukraine many times, just havenât been there recently.â White House officials have been saying since last week that a senior official may travel to Kyiv to meet President Volodymyr Zelensky. Zelensky has also invited Biden to personally make the trip. White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said on Monday that there are currently no plans for Biden to go. She later added that if there were plans in the works, she would not tell reporters in advance anyway. Officials say it's more likely that the US will send the secretary of state or secretary of defence. The Ukrainian president giving his latest video address Ukraineâs
President Zelensky has given his nightly video address, with an update on the
fighting in the east. He says ""the situation
in Mariupol remains as severe as possible without any changes,"" according to the Reuters news agency, adding that Russian forces have been blocking attempts to organise humanitarian corridors to help civilians leave the besieged city. He also says, ""the fate of tens of thousands of Mariupol residents, who have been earlier moved to the territory controlled by Russia, is unknown"". Zelensky claims ""the intensity of fire by Russian troops in the Kharkiv direction, in the Donbas, and in the Dnipro region has increased significantly"" and accuses Russia of targeting
residential buildings and civilians. He adds, ""this is such meanness, which for generations will mark the Russian state as a source of absolute evil.â Brimstone missiles seen attached to a British jet in 2014 More now on what's been promised by UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson, following his video call with President Biden and others earlier. Johnson was among the Western leaders who pledged to send more artillery to Ukraine. Specifically, he said he planned to equip Kyiv with anti-ship missiles - including by mounting British Brimstone rockets to vehicles. Reuters reports that Brimstones have previously been used by UK forces in Libya and Syria, and are typically launched from fast jet aircraft. They're used against fast-moving land and sea targets. Ukraine's allies have provided Kyiv with additional military aircraft and aircraft parts to increase their fleet size and repair others in Ukraine's arsenal that were damaged, the US defence department said on Tuesday. ""They have received additional aircraft and aircraft parts to help them get more aircraft in the air,"" Pentagon spokesman John Kirby said at a news briefing. He added that Washington had not provided aircraft to Kyiv. Earlier, US President Joe Biden held a video call with Western leaders about stepping up military support to Ukraine.They pledged to send more weaponsto help the country defend itself against the renewed Russian offensive in the east.  Jonathan BealeReporting from Dnipro Ukrainian forces are entrenched in the old industrial area The Donbas is mostly open countryside, outside the big
cities. Itâs Ukraineâs old industrial heartland. Youâll see slag heaps and
mines there. Open countryside gives both sides
room for manoeuvre. Russian tanks, which have been seen elsewhere stuck in
columns on roads, will be able to go over fields there and make life more difficult
for Ukrainian forces. But the Ukrainians are well dug-in. Theyâre in
trenches. They have anti-tank weapons supplied by the West which they can use
to effect. I think itâs important what happens in the air. The Donbas
is closer to Russian territory, and the Russians may have more freedom over the
air. They certainly havenât got air superiority at the moment. But itâs difficult for the Ukrainian air force, as small as
it is, to operate that far to the east of the country. So that might be one
advantage for the Russians. Russia's defence ministry has once again called on Ukrainian troops holding out inside Mariupol's Azovstal steel plant to lay down their weapons on Wednesday. Mariupol has been besieged by Russian attacks, but Ukraine's Azov Battalion is reportedly still holding out in Azovstal - a huge steelworks plant overlooking the Azov Sea. Russian troops will observe a cease-fire while the proposal is in effect - starting from 1100 GMT on 20 April. Not a single Ukrainian soldier accepted that same offer on Tuesday, the ministry said in a statement. Russia's military says it controls almost all of Mariupol, but Ukrainian officials insist their remaining soldiers will fight to the end.

Mykhailo
Podolyak said the current hiatus would likely be prolonged by the ongoing siege of Mariupol and Russia's apparent desire to strengthen its hand with a renewed offensive in the east. Relations were also soured by the alleged killing of civilians in the town of Bucha before the withdrawal of Russian forces earlier this month. The last face-to-face talks were on March 29. ""Obviously, against the backdrop of the Mariupol
tragedy, the negotiation process has become even more complicated,"" Podolyak told Reuters. ""Russia defiantly renounces any manifestations of
humanity and humanism when it comes to certain humanitarian corridors.
Especially when we talk about Mariupol."" Ukrainian authorities say at least 20,000 civilians have been killed in Mariupol since the start of the war, and that efforts to evacuate the city have been repeatedly hampered by Russian shelling. ""It
is difficult to say when the next face-to-face round of negotiations will be
possible because the Russians are seriously betting on [making gains in] the
so-called 'second stage of the special operation',"" Podolyak said. Russian-backed forces are reportedly storming the area where Mariupol's final Ukrainian defenders are holed-up - the vast Azovastal iron and steel works. Plumes of smoke can be seen drifting into the air from near the plant, in this drone video released by Ukraine's defence ministry.

In atweet,external, the MoD says: We've just received a White House readout of President Joe Biden's video call with European allies, in which they discussed the ""ongoing provision"" of security, economic and humanitarian aid for Ukraine. The call also included French President Emmanuel Macron, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, Nato Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg, and UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson, among others. According to the readout, the leaders on the call ""affirmed their solidarity"" with Ukraine and condemned ""the humanitarian suffering caused by Russia's unprovoked and unjustified invasion"". ""They also discussed their coordinated efforts to impose severe economic costs to hold Russia accountable,"" the readout says.

Shayan SardarizadehDisinformation specialist, BBC Monitoring The Admiral Kuznetsov aircraft carrier in Murmansk shipyard Google has denied making changes
to its satellite images of Russiaâs military sites after false claims were widely shared online that it
had unblurred images of certain spots. A number of self-described open source intelligence accounts claimed yesterday that Google had stopped hiding
Russiaâs âsecretâ military facilities from public view on its Google Earth and
Maps services. Images of those facilities went
viral online and the story was widely reported as a new development in Ukraine. But Google has never hidden those
facilities, and high-resolution images of Moscowâs military sites and equipment
have been publicly available for years. The companytook to Twitter to refute the claim,external, saying it hadnât made âany blurring changes to our satellite
imagery in Russiaâ. A search of the companyâs
historic imagery function on Google Earth confirms no specific changes have been
made with regard to satellite images from Russia. Google has been found to have
blurred satellite images of certain territories in the past,including parts of Israel and
Palestinian territories, owing to a now defunct US regulation. It also blurssatellite
images of certain sensitive sites,external, likely at the request of national
governments. Destroyed buildings and vehicles in Mariupol on 13 April The embattled Ukrainian city of Mariupol could completely fall to Russian forces within days, a European official has told Reuters. The official, who asked not to be named, said they believe that Russia hopes to declare the city ""liberated"" by 9 May, the date when Russia marks the defeat of Nazi Germany in 1945. ""We do expect a complete destruction of the city and many civilian casualties in Mariupol,"" they added. The official added they fear the death toll could be worse than Bucha, where Russian troops have been accused of killing hundreds of civilians. Russia denies the claims. Additionally, the official said they believed Russia's medium-term objective was to control Luhansk and Donetsk and secure a land corridor with Crimea, which Russia seized in 2014. Such an operation is likely to take between four and six months to complete, after which the conflict could result in a stalemate, the official added. Joe Biden after landing in New Hampshire on 19 April US President Joe Biden has told reporter the US will send more artillery systems to Ukraine amid a renewed Russian offensive in the east. Since the beginning of the Biden administration began, the US has provided $3.2 billion (Â£2.46bn) in security aid to Ukraine, including $2.6bn since the conflict began on 24 February. ""What we have done here is...exactly what the president would do from the beginning. Which is to [provide] significant security assistance, economic assistance, and support to the Ukrainian people,"" White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said on Monday. ""And we're going to continue to do exactly that,"" she added. Rob CameronBBC Prague Correspondent A Ukrainian T-64BV battle tank pictured at a plant in February The Czech Republic will repair Ukrainian tanks and armoured personnel carriers damaged in combat, Czech Defence Minister Jana Cernochova has confirmed. She said the first vehicles would be Ukrainian T-64 tanks, but that others -
including infantry fighting vehicles - would follow. Cernochova
said the Czech Republic was the first country approached by Ukraine with a
request to service and repair combat vehicles. Seznam said the vehicles would also be repaired in Ukraine's neighbour, Slovakia. The Czech
Republic was the first foreign country to supply Ukraine with tanks -
Soviet-era T-72s - as well as BMP-1 infantry fighting vehicles, belonging to
its active reserves. There are also reports it has supplied self-propelled
artillery as well as multiple launch rocket systems. The defence ministry refuses to specify the amount and type of deliveries to Ukraine,
confirming only that it is sending both light and heavy weapons and will
continue to do so regardless of Russian objections. Alongside the official
government military aid, a crowd-funding campaign to buy weapons for the
Ukrainian armed forces has so far raised over â¬40m (Â£33m). UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said the UK will step up aid to Ukraine and provide artillery systems at a time in which the conflict ""is in a very perilous stage"". Speaking in the House of Commons after a video call with Western allies, Johnson said that it is ""vital that we don't allow Putin to gain momentum"" in the eastern Donbas region. ""That's why we are stepping up our supply of military hardware of the kind that the Ukrainians particularly need now,"" he said, adding that the war has become ""an artillery conflict"". ""That is what we are giving them, in addition to many other forms of support,"" he added. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Boris Johnson again apologises for breaking lockdown laws in his first address to Parliament since being fined by police But the PM repeats his defence that he did not knowingly break the rules Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer calls the apology ""a joke"" and says the PM is insulting the public The PM's comments are met with jeers from opposition parties, and Tory MP Mark Harper tweets a letter saying he no longer had confidence in him MPs will vote on Thursday on whether the PM should be investigated for knowingly misleading Parliament over breaching Covid laws It comes after the Speaker said he would allow MPs time to debate a motion from Labour on whether to refer Johnson to Parliament's Privileges Committee Johnson, his wife Carrie and Chancellor Rishi Sunak have paid fines for attending a birthday gathering for the PM in June 2020 Edited by Emma Owen That's it from us on this subject for today. Our contributors were Dulcie Lee, Jennifer Scott, Kate Whannel, Megan Fisher, Arryn Moy and Alex Kleiderman. Have a good evening, and remember there's always more to read on our politics page -here. It was a dramatic first day after the Easter break, with Boris Johnson addressing MPs for the first time since becoming the UK's first sitting prime minister to be sanctioned for breaking the law. What happened?  What next?  Want more? Jennifer ScottPolitical reporter, BBC News So far, more than 50 fines have been issued for breaking Covid laws in No 10 and Whitehall. The BBC is aware of three events that have led to fines so far. But the Met Police's investigation is into 12 events in total - meaning there are nine more gatherings that could result in sanctions. The prime minister is known to have attended at least two of these, and reports suggest he could have been at up to three more. So in theory, Mr Johnson could face more fines, depending on the outcome of the police investigation. The PM has promised to get back to focusing on voter priorities - including the cost of living crisis and the war on Ukraine. But will his determination overcome any future twists and turns in this saga, whether it be fines or further damning details? Read morehere. Let's get a final bit of reaction to today's events from the Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice UK group. They say the PM's apology sounded like ""the words of someone who is sorry theyâve been caught, not someone who regrets the harm theyâve done"". Ina statement on Twitter,externalthe group say his defence that he didn't knowingly break the rules was laughable. ""Backbench Tory MPs might want us to move on from Partygate, but first theyâll need to move Johnson on from his office,"" they say. Also earlier, Plaid Cymru's Westminster leader Liz Savile Roberts described the PM as ""a millstone round his government's neck"". ""The PM debases himself, debases his office and debases his government,"" she said. We're just going back over a bit more of what was said in the Commons earlier, and SDLP MP Colum Eastwood said the PM and chancellor were ""partying in Downing Street"" while his constituents were ""watching through care home windows as their parents died"". ""We know he has no respect for the public but show us he has some respect for himself and please, please, please resign now."" This video can not be played Watch: Mark Harper explains why he no longer has confidence in the PM's leadership More now from Conservative MP Mark Harper, who earlier told the Commons that Boris Johnson was no longer worthy of the ""great office"" he holds. Explaining his decision to submit a letter of no confidence in the PM, the former chief whip tells the BBC many people made extraordinary sacrifices to obey lockdown laws. Harper says all his Conservative colleagues are going to have make a decision soon about whether they want Johnson to continue. ""I'm not expecting lots to follow me today, but they're going to have to reflect in the coming days and weeks,"" he says. ""I think many of them will reach the same conclusion that I have."" Boris Johnson will be heading off to India to meet Prime Minister Modi this week Just a little aside... When MPs head to the Commons on Thursday to debate the actions of Boris Johnson, and whether they merit a referral to the Privileges Committee, the prime minister will be nowhere near the chamber. Instead, he will be Ahmedabad, India, as he begins a visit to the country to bolster trade. Johnson will then travel to
New Delhi on Friday to meet Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi. We do understand the PM will be in the House for Prime Minister's Questions on Wednesday before his trip though. Boris Johnson's time at the despatch box has now come to an end. Oppostion MPs have been coming with call after call for his resignation. Johnson will address Tory backbenchers behind closed doors at 20:00 BST. The Green Party's Caroline Lucas asked earlier what could be done to protect the ministerial code - the rulebook on behaviour issued by the PM - ""when the person who is entrusted with guarding it breaks that code"". The Brighton Pavilion MP then quoted a historianwho recently described Johnsonas a ""rogue prime minister"". Johnson said he didn't agree with the ""characterisation"" and reiterated that he had explained and apologised. We found out earlier that MPs will get to vote on Thursday on whether Johnson should be investigated for knowingly misleading Parliament in his past statements about No 10 parties. Iain WatsonPolitical correspondent While one new letter of no confidence in Boris Johnson
has gone in today, most non-Ukraine contributions from the Conservative benches have welcomed
the PMâs repeated apologies - though the former minister Steve Baker, a
Christian, wanted more than that: repentance. Significantly, while he has organised many succesful
rebellions against his own party leaders, he did not join fellow Covid Recovery
Group member Mark Harper in calling for the current leader to go. As we type, Boris Johnson is still in the House of Commons answering questions from MPs in his first appearance since being fined for breaking lockdown laws. Here is a quick re-cap of what we have heard so far: A little earlier, Tory MP Julian Lewis asked if the prime minister had the power to make senior civil servant Sue Gray publish her full report into the parties in Downing Street during lockdown. You may remember Boris Johnson ordered her to carry out an inquiry - but its full publication was paused by the police investigation. Lewis said publishing it ""would put an end to this matter"" and stop the government being ""diverted away"" from helping Ukraine. Johnson said the Metropolitan Police should conclude its investigation before such a report is published. ""The public have made up their minds. They know what he is,"" Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer says. Watch his verdict on Johnson's apology below. This video can not be played Tory MP Michael Fabricant, who has defended the PM throughout the Partygate row, says he is desperately sad to hear about his own constituent referenced by the Labour leader in his speech. He describes how his best friend's mother died in hospital without them by their side, and notes that the PM's mother also died during the pandemic. ""We've all suffered from these heart-wrenching tragedies,"" he adds, ""and none of us should forget it."" But it seems his support is still firmly with Boris Johnson. Conservative Steve Baker says the prime minister ""could not have made a more humble apology"". He says the PM also needs to show repentance and asks for an assurance that ""nothing of this kind will ever happen again"". Boris Johnson repeats his apology. The DUP's Sammy Wilson says the PM's apology was genuine. He adds it is important to focus on the future rather than the past. He asks Boris Johnson what discussions the PM has had about the weaponry Ukrainians need to drive back the Russians. Johnson says the UK is in continuous discussions with Ukraine. Tory backbencher Peter Bone points to the announcement earlier that MPs will vote on Thursday on whether to refer the PM to the privileges committee. He says there is only one issue in question for such an investigation - ""Did the prime minister deliberately mislead the House [over the parties]?"" Bone asks Johnson the question directly. The PM answers: ""No."" Iain WatsonPolitical correspondent The former chief whip Mark Harper delivers a blow to the
PM - says he is not fit for high office. So far he has kept his powder dry but as a formidable organiser, this
intervention could yet be significant. Many other Conservative critics have bitten their tongues
during the Ukraine conflict. More on former chief whip Mark Harper, who confirms on Twitter that he's submitted a letter of no confidence in the prime minister. In the letter, he says Johnson is ""no longer able to deliver the principled leadership required to take our country forward"". Tory MPs can trigger a leadership contest if 54 letters of no confidence are sent to Sir Graham Brady, who chairs a committee of backbench MPs known as the 1922 Committee. There's no official running tally of how many letters have been submitted - they have been triggered by various issues over the course of Johnson's leadership - the only way we'll know for sure is if that crucial threshold of 54 letters is reached.

"Most of Sviatohirsk's residents have fled the town In a picturesque resort town on the northern edge of Ukraine's Donbas region, people can hear the shelling coming closer. The Russians are just five miles to the north. Sviatohirsk was once a staple of the tourist trail but now it is just another place in the Donbas where people flee the fighting. Most of its permanent residents have themselves fled, fearing the war will not stop its ruthless advance here. It was famed for its historic Russian Orthodox church and monastery, set amid the wooded Holy Mountains of the Donbas. That monastery has been damaged by shrapnel from a Russian air strike that hit a target nearby. There is now a gaping hole in the church spire. Just to the north is the city of Izyum where there is already fierce fighting. The residents who had fled Izyum told us they had been bombed day and night, been without running water and electricity for weeks. They also said there were bodies on the streets. The support of religious leaders is helping some cope with the trauma of war ""Everyone is worried,"" the town's mayor, Vladimir, tells me. He says those who have remained regularly call to check he's not leaving. He is not. He is staying put and organising food parcels for the town's dwindling population. These are people who are tired, hungry and scared, too scared sometimes to apportion any blame on Russia. ""I will not talk about it,"" one woman tells me, ""because we still have to go home."" Russia is open about the fact that its renewed focus in the war will be in Ukraine's east, the Donbas. The Russian offensive here is coming from three directions - from the north, south and the east. But the landscape of the town that so charms its visitors also offers some kind of protection to its terrified residents. Unlike most of the Donbas region, which is largely flat open landscape,  Sviatohirsk is set among hills and forests - providing some natural defences - making it harder for an army to manoeuvre with artillery and tanks. The people left in the area find themselves queuing for emergency food parcels The residents who have stayed behind now rub shoulders with soldiers getting a brief respite from the fighting. They grab a coffee from one of the few shops left open. The military's not allowed to speak to us without permission. One man proudly tells us he was trained by British troops before the latest war started. He's confident that Ukraine can win this war. But I meet another soldier who sounds less assured. The unrelenting Russian bombardment is taking its toll. Another soldier tells us that the Russians have been targeting their positions with white phosphorous shells - which burn into the flesh. There is now a real danger that Russia may soon try to encircle Ukrainian forces in the region who have been fighting Russian-backed separatist in the region since 2014. Ukrainian troops there are among the most battle hardened in the Ukrainian Army. But they, too, are  worried that their supply lines could be cut off as Russian forces push in from three different directions. The unit we saw look well trained and well equipped. Their automatic weapons were fitted with suppressors, which are silencers. An officer who agreed to be interviewed says his son, too, was trained - by US and British forces. The Ukrainian army now is better prepared than when separatists took over the Donbas in 2014 Volodomyr told us that the Ukrainian Army is now much better prepared than the one of 2014 - when Russian backed separatists took over part of the Donbas. ""If this war had happened then, I don't know how it would end, but now we know the Russian aggressors will get what they deserve."" Volodomyr says the Russians are using similar tactics they have used elsewhere in Ukraine - ""creating panic among the local population"". He says ""it's inhuman"". It is now happening right across the Donbas. ANALYSIS:What does Putin want? WATCH:The elderly who can't flee their homes DIPLOMACY:Germany's conundrum over ties with Russia READ MORE:Full coverage of the crisis,external From the distance we could see and hear the city of Severodonetsk being pounded. We tried to enter but had to turn back when we heard the whistle of a shell landing nearby. It was a similar scene further south in the city of Avdiivka - where the remnants of a once bustling industrial  city were now hiding in bunkers. Gallina showed the crater caused by a bomb landing in her garden Even a nearby village hadn't been spared. Sixty-year-old Gallina showed us the crater which had landed in her garden - blowing out the windows of her small home the night before. Inside, her granddaughter, Anastasia, was cowering under a table - still too frightened to come out. Gallina told me ""there's nothing funny about this situation"". ""We live here like cannon fodder,"" she added. Anastasia has been hiding under a table since a bomb landed near her home, frightened to come out Ukrainian forces are  trying to slow any Russian advance - as they did in Kyiv. One soldier shows us drone footage of a bridge they recently blew up - to the north of Izyum. It brings a  column of military trucks to a standstill. But more will be coming. What is happening in the Donbas now - the incessant, unrelenting shelling - is the prelude to the long expected offensive. Russia is trying to weaken Ukraine's defences and its people's resolve. There have been also Russian probing attacks across the frontline. Most have been so far repelled by Ukraine forces. But they know more will be coming. Russia is still massing and reconstituting its battered units. There are still questions as to whether Russian forces will perform any better in the east than they did outside the capital Kyiv - where they were forced to retreat. The UK's Ministry of Defence believes Russian commanders will also be concerned by the time it is taking them to subdue the port city of Mariupol - which has diverted men and materiel - slowing the Russian advance elsewhere. Ukraine still fears worse is to come. That's why President Volodymyr Zelensky has once again been calling for more weapons. Until recently Western support has been limited to ""defensive weapons"" - such as anti-tank and anti-aircraft missiles. But some countries are now sending heavier weapons. We have seen some of it - such as armoured vehicles - arrive on the frontline. The Czech Republic is providing Ukraine with a dozen T-72 tanks. The latest batch of US military aid will include 18 howitzers. But that will probably not be enough to tip to balance overwhelmingly in favour of Ukraine. Back in Sviatohirsk, Mayor Vladimir says he is still holding out hope that this conflict can be resolved through diplomacy. ""All this is terrible,"" he says. ""This destruction has no future.""

"The war in Ukraine will ""severely set back"" the global economic recovery with the UK hit harder than most, the International Monetary Fund has said. The conflict is driving up prices for food and fuel which the international body expects to slow growth globally. It has cut its global forecast and also downgraded its outlook for the UK. This means the UK will no longer be the fastest growing economy in the G7 group of leading Western nations, and will be the slowest in 2023, it says. The body says that UK growth will slow as price pressures lead households to cut spending, while rising interest rates are expected to ""cool investment"". The UK's economy is now predicted to grow by 3.7% this year, down from the previous forecast of 4.7% made in January. However, next year, the UK is expected to have the slowest growth in the G7 and across Europe's main economies, at just 1.2%, a near halving from the 2.3% expected previously. The 2023 UK figure is the slowest apart from heavily-sanctioned Russia in the wider G20 grouping, which includes nations such as China and India. The IMF said that the UK was the fastest growing G7 economy in 2021, and is forecast to be the second fastest in 2022. The low UK growth rates forecast in 2023 are in part due to the UK rebounding more quickly from the pandemic than some of its G7 peers. However, the UK is also wrestling with high inflation, which will hit growth in 2023, as people cut spending as their real income shrinks, the IMF said. The organisation expects inflation to peak in late 2022 at 9%. It said rising interest rates will also slow the UK economy in 2023 and 2023, while government policies such as getting rid of certain tax breaks will reduce business investment at that time. In addition, Brexit will hold back export growth, the IMF said, and it will continue to make pandemic-related labour supply ""scarring"" worse by reducing immigration. ""However, the impact of Brexit is spread over several years and is not the primary driver of the slowdown in 2023,"" a spokesperson for the organisation added. The IMF works with its 189 member countriesto try to stabilise the global economy, including issuing short-term loans and assistance to countries who are struggling. It said inflation was now a ""clear and present danger"" in many countries and the situation has added to supply strains from the coronavirus pandemic. ""In the matter of a few weeks, the world has yet again experienced a major, transformative shock,"" IMF director of research Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas wrote in the organisation's 2022 World Economic Outlook. ""Just as a durable recovery from the pandemic-induced global economic collapse appeared in sight, the war has created the very real prospect that a large part of the recent gains will be erased."" The organisation said it expected global growth of just 3.6% this year, down nearly a percentage point from its forecast before the war. Price rises fastest for 30 years as petrol soars China spending and employment hit amid lockdowns Ukraine war causes 'giant leap' in food prices The World Bank also said it was lowering its growth forecast from 4.1% to 3.2%. The conflict has already devastated the economies of Ukraine and Russia, which the West cut off from key trade and financial networks with sanctions following the invasion. Ukraine is facing a severe contraction of 35% or more this year, while Russia's economy is expected to shrink by 8.5%, the IMF said. But with Russia a major energy producer and key supplier of staples such as wheat and corn alongside Ukraine, the consequences will ripple far beyond their borders, the IMF warned. There have been two acute shocks to the world economy in quick succession - the pandemic and the Ukraine war. The latter is building on the problems created by the former, tripping up what had been a healthy recovery, and sending prices rising at an even faster rate. Food and energy prices were already being hiked by the supply bottlenecks after the pandemic, before one of the world's biggest energy suppliers invaded one of the world's biggest food exporter. But now there are new bottlenecks emerging from the stringent Covid lockdowns in some regions of China. Rising prices risk social stability in poorer countries, dependent on food imports. Fears about inflation becoming entrenched are leading the world's central bankers to raise interest rates. In turn that is raising the cost of borrowing for the record debts many nations racked up during the pandemic. So all this requires some skill and cooperation among the old and new financial powerhouses of the world. But that has been another commodity in short supply in recent times. ""The economic effects of the war are spreading far and wide - like seismic waves that emanate from the epicenter of an earthquake,"" it said. In Germany, where the economy is especially closely entwined, the war is likely to lower growth by 1.7 percentage points, it said. Even in countries with little direct trade with Russia and Ukraine, households will feel the effects of the war, as central banks respond to the more rapid inflation by raising interest rates, making borrowing more expensive, the IMF said. In the US, for example, the organisation lowered its forecast for growth in 2022 by 0.3 percentage points to 3.7%, citing the prospect of more aggressive interest rate rises. Ukraine and Russia accounted for nearly 30% of the world's wheat Overall, inflation pressures are significantly worse than they were when the IMF issued its previous forecast in January. It now predicts inflation in ""advanced economies"" will hit 5.7% this year, while it is likely to reach 8.7% in emerging markets. UK inflation is expected to be 5.3% next year - the highest in the G7, and higher than all EU members, and only exceeded in the G20 by crisis-ridden Argentina, Turkey and Russia. ""Inflation has become a clear and present danger for many countries,"" Mr Gourinchas wrote in a blog. A few countries, such as oil exporters, are benefiting. The IMF expects growth in Saudi Arabia, for example, to be stronger than it did in January. But the risks are not purely economic, the IMF added. It said the war had also created a refugee crisis and aggravated political tensions, risking a ""more permanent fragmentation of the world economy into geopolitical blocks with distinct technology standards, cross-border payment systems, and reserve currencies"". ""Such a 'tectonic shift' would cause long-run efficiency losses, increase volatility and represent a major challenge to the rules-based framework that has governed international and economic relations for the last 75 years,"" the IMF said. A Treasury spokesperson said the IMF forecasts ""will be concerning for many people and families"" in the UK. ""However the support we provided over the past two years has put our economy in a good position to deal with these headwinds, including through record numbers of employees on payrolls and a strong economic recovery from the pandemic,"" the spokesperson said. Labour's shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves said the IMF forecast ""shows the extreme challenges facing the UK economy"". ""While it is true that global forces play a role, the fact that the UK is forecast to have the slowest growth of any G7 economy next year plus the highest inflation, shows the uniquely bad situation the UK is in. ""Inflation spiralling out of control this year has created a cost of living crisis hitting families across the country, needing decisive and urgent action,"" she said, repeating Labour calls for a windfall tax on oil and gas firms. Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesperson Christine Jardine said the UK government had ""failed to shield the UK from spiralling energy bills and soaring inflation, but they have gone ahead with raising people's taxes to their highest point in 70 years"".

"Boris Johnson again apologises for breaking lockdown laws in his first address to Parliament since being fined by police But the PM repeats his defence that he did not knowingly break the rules Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer calls the apology ""a joke"" and says the PM is insulting the public The PM's comments are met with jeers from opposition parties, and Tory MP Mark Harper tweets a letter saying he no longer had confidence in him MPs will vote on Thursday on whether the PM should be investigated for knowingly misleading Parliament over breaching Covid laws It comes after the Speaker said he would allow MPs time to debate a motion from Labour on whether to refer Johnson to Parliament's Privileges Committee Johnson, his wife Carrie and Chancellor Rishi Sunak have paid fines for attending a birthday gathering for the PM in June 2020 Edited by Emma Owen That's it from us on this subject for today. Our contributors were Dulcie Lee, Jennifer Scott, Kate Whannel, Megan Fisher, Arryn Moy and Alex Kleiderman. Have a good evening, and remember there's always more to read on our politics page -here. It was a dramatic first day after the Easter break, with Boris Johnson addressing MPs for the first time since becoming the UK's first sitting prime minister to be sanctioned for breaking the law. What happened?  What next?  Want more? Jennifer ScottPolitical reporter, BBC News So far, more than 50 fines have been issued for breaking Covid laws in No 10 and Whitehall. The BBC is aware of three events that have led to fines so far. But the Met Police's investigation is into 12 events in total - meaning there are nine more gatherings that could result in sanctions. The prime minister is known to have attended at least two of these, and reports suggest he could have been at up to three more. So in theory, Mr Johnson could face more fines, depending on the outcome of the police investigation. The PM has promised to get back to focusing on voter priorities - including the cost of living crisis and the war on Ukraine. But will his determination overcome any future twists and turns in this saga, whether it be fines or further damning details? Read morehere. Let's get a final bit of reaction to today's events from the Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice UK group. They say the PM's apology sounded like ""the words of someone who is sorry theyâve been caught, not someone who regrets the harm theyâve done"". Ina statement on Twitter,externalthe group say his defence that he didn't knowingly break the rules was laughable. ""Backbench Tory MPs might want us to move on from Partygate, but first theyâll need to move Johnson on from his office,"" they say. Also earlier, Plaid Cymru's Westminster leader Liz Savile Roberts described the PM as ""a millstone round his government's neck"". ""The PM debases himself, debases his office and debases his government,"" she said. We're just going back over a bit more of what was said in the Commons earlier, and SDLP MP Colum Eastwood said the PM and chancellor were ""partying in Downing Street"" while his constituents were ""watching through care home windows as their parents died"". ""We know he has no respect for the public but show us he has some respect for himself and please, please, please resign now."" This video can not be played Watch: Mark Harper explains why he no longer has confidence in the PM's leadership More now from Conservative MP Mark Harper, who earlier told the Commons that Boris Johnson was no longer worthy of the ""great office"" he holds. Explaining his decision to submit a letter of no confidence in the PM, the former chief whip tells the BBC many people made extraordinary sacrifices to obey lockdown laws. Harper says all his Conservative colleagues are going to have make a decision soon about whether they want Johnson to continue. ""I'm not expecting lots to follow me today, but they're going to have to reflect in the coming days and weeks,"" he says. ""I think many of them will reach the same conclusion that I have."" Boris Johnson will be heading off to India to meet Prime Minister Modi this week Just a little aside... When MPs head to the Commons on Thursday to debate the actions of Boris Johnson, and whether they merit a referral to the Privileges Committee, the prime minister will be nowhere near the chamber. Instead, he will be Ahmedabad, India, as he begins a visit to the country to bolster trade. Johnson will then travel to
New Delhi on Friday to meet Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi. We do understand the PM will be in the House for Prime Minister's Questions on Wednesday before his trip though. Boris Johnson's time at the despatch box has now come to an end. Oppostion MPs have been coming with call after call for his resignation. Johnson will address Tory backbenchers behind closed doors at 20:00 BST. The Green Party's Caroline Lucas asked earlier what could be done to protect the ministerial code - the rulebook on behaviour issued by the PM - ""when the person who is entrusted with guarding it breaks that code"". The Brighton Pavilion MP then quoted a historianwho recently described Johnsonas a ""rogue prime minister"". Johnson said he didn't agree with the ""characterisation"" and reiterated that he had explained and apologised. We found out earlier that MPs will get to vote on Thursday on whether Johnson should be investigated for knowingly misleading Parliament in his past statements about No 10 parties. Iain WatsonPolitical correspondent While one new letter of no confidence in Boris Johnson
has gone in today, most non-Ukraine contributions from the Conservative benches have welcomed
the PMâs repeated apologies - though the former minister Steve Baker, a
Christian, wanted more than that: repentance. Significantly, while he has organised many succesful
rebellions against his own party leaders, he did not join fellow Covid Recovery
Group member Mark Harper in calling for the current leader to go. As we type, Boris Johnson is still in the House of Commons answering questions from MPs in his first appearance since being fined for breaking lockdown laws. Here is a quick re-cap of what we have heard so far: A little earlier, Tory MP Julian Lewis asked if the prime minister had the power to make senior civil servant Sue Gray publish her full report into the parties in Downing Street during lockdown. You may remember Boris Johnson ordered her to carry out an inquiry - but its full publication was paused by the police investigation. Lewis said publishing it ""would put an end to this matter"" and stop the government being ""diverted away"" from helping Ukraine. Johnson said the Metropolitan Police should conclude its investigation before such a report is published. ""The public have made up their minds. They know what he is,"" Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer says. Watch his verdict on Johnson's apology below. This video can not be played Tory MP Michael Fabricant, who has defended the PM throughout the Partygate row, says he is desperately sad to hear about his own constituent referenced by the Labour leader in his speech. He describes how his best friend's mother died in hospital without them by their side, and notes that the PM's mother also died during the pandemic. ""We've all suffered from these heart-wrenching tragedies,"" he adds, ""and none of us should forget it."" But it seems his support is still firmly with Boris Johnson. Conservative Steve Baker says the prime minister ""could not have made a more humble apology"". He says the PM also needs to show repentance and asks for an assurance that ""nothing of this kind will ever happen again"". Boris Johnson repeats his apology. The DUP's Sammy Wilson says the PM's apology was genuine. He adds it is important to focus on the future rather than the past. He asks Boris Johnson what discussions the PM has had about the weaponry Ukrainians need to drive back the Russians. Johnson says the UK is in continuous discussions with Ukraine. Tory backbencher Peter Bone points to the announcement earlier that MPs will vote on Thursday on whether to refer the PM to the privileges committee. He says there is only one issue in question for such an investigation - ""Did the prime minister deliberately mislead the House [over the parties]?"" Bone asks Johnson the question directly. The PM answers: ""No."" Iain WatsonPolitical correspondent The former chief whip Mark Harper delivers a blow to the
PM - says he is not fit for high office. So far he has kept his powder dry but as a formidable organiser, this
intervention could yet be significant. Many other Conservative critics have bitten their tongues
during the Ukraine conflict. More on former chief whip Mark Harper, who confirms on Twitter that he's submitted a letter of no confidence in the prime minister. In the letter, he says Johnson is ""no longer able to deliver the principled leadership required to take our country forward"". Tory MPs can trigger a leadership contest if 54 letters of no confidence are sent to Sir Graham Brady, who chairs a committee of backbench MPs known as the 1922 Committee. There's no official running tally of how many letters have been submitted - they have been triggered by various issues over the course of Johnson's leadership - the only way we'll know for sure is if that crucial threshold of 54 letters is reached.

"There are no EU flags at Marine Le Pen rallies European Union officials return to work on Tuesday after basking in a balmy bank holiday. But, just over the border, the EU's future is being fought over in the French presidential election. Far-right candidate, Marine Le Pen, insists she has no secret ""Frexit"" agenda. But opponents claim her policies would put France's place in the EU at risk. Supporters argue that Brussels has failed to learn the lessons from Brexit. Voters will choose on Sunday between Ms Le Pen and incumbent Emmanuel Macron, who leads centrist movement La RÃ©publique En Marche (Republic on the move). Le Pen, the head of Rassemblement National (National Rally), has notably toned down her approach to the EU at this election. In 2017, her manifesto promised a referendum on EU membership, following six months of talks to try to radically reform the bloc. But read through this year's document, ""22 measures for France,external"", and the EU doesn't even get a direct mention. Gone, too, is talk of pulling France out of the single currency, the euro. French government minister and En Marche member Jean-Baptiste Lemoyne believes her softer stance is down to her desire to ""conquer the presidency"". ""But she's questioning some fundamentals of the EU,"" he says. What's undisputed is that a Le Pen win would send shockwaves through Brussels. Unlike the UK, France was a founding member of what eventually became the European Union and is now its second largest financial backer. Marine Le Pen wants to slash France's contributions to the EU, tighten border controls and hold a referendum on stopping ""uncontrolled"" immigration. Emmanuel Macron says the election run-off is a referendum on Europe That would include prioritising French people's access to welfare, social housing and jobs. Such policies appear to be in direct contradiction with free movement and the primacy of EU law. It's the quest for an ""Ã  la carte"" membership, says Jonathan Eyal, Associate Director at the Royal United Services Institute (Rusi) think tank. Her plans could lead, he says, to EU ""paralysis"" if other member states, like Poland and Hungary, join forces with France in trying to curb the powers of the European Commission. It's an idea that would look more like ""a gaggle of nations states rather than a unified concept"". But a looser alliance of nations or ""opt-in, opt-out"" system would, says one Le Pen supporter, breathe ""new life"" into the EU. National Rally councillor Patricia Chagnon from Abbeville says Le Pen wants to ""unshackle"" member states from a ""big bureaucratic machine"". And, she argues, it's those who ""don't agree with reforming the EU"" who characterise Le Pen's policies as Frexit by the back door. ""Marine Le Pen is in favour of respecting the sovereignty and the independence of each member state"" while realising the importance of ""close co-operation"", she says. Emmanuel Macron has described Sunday's vote as a ""referendum on Europe"". A Marine Le Pen win would indeed be an ""earthquake"" for the EU, says Sylvie Kauffmann, editorial director of French daily Le Monde. However, she points to Mr Macron's persistent lead in the polls and the fact that, were Marine Le Pen to defy the current odds, she'd also have the challenge of pulling off a majority in June's parliamentary elections. Even so, Jonathan Eyal says a Le Pen presidency could prove highly disruptive for the West. She would ""be in a state of perpetual revolution"" with both the EU and the Western military alliance, Nato, he says. A former member of the European Parliament, Marine Le Pen is no stranger to clashes with Brussels. On Monday, she hit back at reports that the EU's anti-corruption body Olaf has accused her and senior colleagues of embezzling more than â¬600,000 (Â£500,000) while serving as MEPs. She described it as ""low blows from the European Union, just a few days from the second roundâ¦ I absolutely deny these allegations, which I wasn't even aware of"". All eyes in Brussels now turn their eyes to Wednesday's crucial live TV debate between the two rivals, ahead of Sunday's vote.

"After years of disruption, many firms are hoping for things to return to normal. But it's not yet business as usual. The recent spike in Covid cases has caused havoc, with staff sickness impacting entire supply chains. The British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) is now calling for all companies to be given free or cheap lateral flow tests. The government said it recognised the impact of rising costs and had given firms Â£400 billion in Covid support. But Jane Gratton of the BCC said Covid, paired with rising costs, meant this was a ""precarious time"" for business. The organisation, which represents tens of thousands of businesses, added that three quarters of its members had at least one person off sick in the last four weeks. It says that free or lower cost testing is necessary to ensure that both staff and customers are kept safe. All of the above is on the mind of Sanjay Aggarwal, who runs Spice Kitchen on the outskirts of Liverpool. The company, which blends and packages ingredients for gifts and subscription deliveries, has 15 staff split between the office, and others blending and bagging spices on the shop floor. Sanjay Aggarwal runs Spice Kitchen on the outskirts of Liverpool ""We've had instances where we've had a number of cases in the warehouse, enough for us to shut down production for a week or two weeks,"" Sanjay says. ""There were times when it was just me in the unit running the whole business."" Official data shows that the Omicron peak for factory-floor workers was back in January, but for office-based staff it has come in more recent weeks. The same pattern has emerged at Spice Kitchen. The firm has grown during the pandemic as so many of us were stuck at home. But now restrictions are more relaxed, Sanjay feels like it's been down to him and his small team to work out what to do. ""The guidance is not totally clear and it's tricky for businesses, having to make up their own rules,"" he explains. ""It now comes down to leadership teams like myself to come up with the right requirements for staff."" Should you go to work when you're ill? Small business owners: We're taking the hit The company has moved to a larger space, which has helped, but they've also recruited and found they've needed to get to know new starters a bit better. ""It was important for us to find out about people's personal situations,"" explains Sanjay, adding that this was a priority when discussing vaccines with young warehouse staff. ""It's not down to us as employers to enforce that, but we do need to know who is and who isn't so we can make the right decisions to protect them. Especially as some of our young staff are caring for family members,"" he added. Kieran Sefton, who's been with the business since he left school, said he recently had Covid but was able to do some work from home. ""I've had Covid and I just wasn't very well, but I could still work at home and get on with things. For me, it was more of a worry about my family."" Figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) show that about one in six businesses (17%) are paying sick pay to staff voluntarily self-isolating when testing positive. And as the cost of living rises, many can't afford to skip a paycheque or pay for a lateral flow test. A pack of five will set you back just under Â£10 from most High Street chemists. Spice Kitchen Operations Manager Lesley McKay says the business has offered free tests and sanitised spaces, but there is a limit to what they can do and they know they need to keep working. ""We are actually really busy at the moment. We don't take it lightly, but as a small business, you do just have to crack on,"" she says. Lesley McKay says it's important the small business keeps going Spice Kitchen is not alone in this experience. The Federation of Small Businesses has said one in seven businesses they represent could not trade as they should at the moment. The challenge is more acute for customer-facing staff in shops, bars or restaurants. Laura Kearsley specialises in employment law at Nelsons Solicitors and is advising her clients how to navigate what they describe as a ""lack of guidelines"". ""Most businesses were glad to see the back of formal regulations but in a way they were a comfort blanket with someone making the decision for you,"" she explains. ""Now businesses have more discretion, but that brings a headache in itself for them."" Laura says she's hearing three main issues from her clients; what policies to implement for staff with Covid now free tests are not available, what to do with staff they think are not being honest about Covid symptoms because they are worried about not being paid and how to support vulnerable members of the workforce. ""In all cases, it's important firms properly listen to their staff,"" she says. The wave of infections may be passing its peak, but working out just how business lives with Covid, could take many more months to work out fully. A government spokesperson said: ""Employers still have a duty of care to their staff, so they should take steps to prevent infection in the workplace, meaning if someone is displaying Covid-19 symptoms or has tested positive, they should be considered sick and stay at home to avoid contact with others."" They added: ""We recognise the impact rising costs will have on businesses of all sizes and we have backed businesses throughout the pandemic with an unprecedented package of support including VAT cuts, business rates holidays and government backed loans worth around Â£400 billion.""

"Civil servants must stop working from home and return to the office to ensure government buildings are at full capacity, ministers have been told. Cabinet Office minister Jacob Rees-Mogg has written to cabinet colleagues urging them to send a ""clear message"" to the civil service about returning. The FDA union said his comments were out of step with practice in the private sector. Average daily attendance in the week of 4 April was 44%, figures show. The government's recommendation for people to work from homeended in January, after being reintroduced in the face of the emergence of the Omicron variant last year. But Mr Rees-Mogg - who also has the role of government efficiencies minister as part of his brief - said there was ""much further to go"" to reach pre-pandemic levels. The prime minister's official spokesman said it was right to push for a return to pre-pandemic levels of occupancy. He said it was not just about ""value-for-money"" for taxpayer-funded buildings but also of benefit to staff - particularly junior staff, whose career development can be hampered by a lack of face-to-face working, the government believes. Should I be working from home now? What will Jacob Rees-Mogg do in his new job? In a letter to the heads of government departments dated 13 April, seen by the BBC, he urged cabinet ministers to ""review any guidance within your departments that sets an expectation of the minimum number of days in the office per week."" He also sent a league table of daily civil service office attendance from the week beginning on 4 April, which shows in some departments daily average of staff in the workplace was lower than a third. The Department for Education had the lowest office attendance at 25% of current daily capacity, while the Department for International Trade was highest at 73%. The average across all departments in the same week was 44%, according to the figures. Mr Rees-Mogg said he planned to continue visiting departments with lower attendance figures to ""ensure we are making efficient use of the central London estate"". Dave Penman, the general secretary of the FDA which represents senior civil servants, said the move was ""vindictive"" and accused ministers of acting like ""luddites"". He said there was ""no rationale"" for it, arguing that ministers ""couldn't point to productivity losses"" and were obsessed with micro-managing the civil service. Some senior Tory MPs have also called for more to be done to encourage civil servants back to their workplaces. Sir Graham Brady, chairman of the backbench 1922 committee, wrote at the weekend: ""It is simply unacceptable for so many of our public servants to continue sitting at home."" Asked about the letter, a government spokeswoman said: ""Ministers have been clear that departments should make maximum use of office space and progress is being monitored."" However, some have suggested forcing civil servants to return to the office may be counter-productive. In areport from February,external, the Institute for Government think tank argued offering hybrid working has key benefits to help the government achieve its agenda and said the government would be wrong to force a return to full-time office work. It said the benefits of flexible working were needed to help the government relocate centres of the civil service outside of London - and to recruit the best staff.

"President Volodymyr Zelensky said a ""large part of the entire Russian army"" is now focused on the Donbas offensive Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky has said Russia has launched an assault to seize the eastern Donbas region. Russian and Ukrainian forces clashed on Tuesday along the eastern front line, after Mr Zelensky said the battle for the Donbas had begun. Ukraine's top security official, Oleksiy Danilov, said Russia was trying break through Ukrainian defensive positions throughout Ukraine's east. The offensive had been expected after Russia failed to seize Kyiv. After its push to overrun the capital stalled, Moscow announced its military would focus instead on eastern Ukraine where Russian-backed separatists have been fighting Ukrainian forces since 2014. Luhansk is one of the most fiercely contested regions, and on Tuesday its Governor Serhiy Hayday said it had come under attack from all sides. He announced that street fighting in the city of Kreminna had forced Ukrainian troops to withdraw and regroup, leaving Russian forces in control of the eastern city of 18,000. ""They moved in but our defenders had to retreat,"" Mr Hayday said. ""The enemy was shelling every metre of our defence line."" The strategic port city of Mariupol, meanwhile, has come under intense bombardment. Pro-Russian forces have reportedly begun an attempt to storm the city's Azovstal steelworks, where Mariupol's final defenders have been holding out for days. Ukraine says civilians and children are among those holed up in the complex, but pro-Russian officials in the city have disputed this. Mariupol is a key Russian target which if captured would allow its troops to complete a land-bridge between the occupied Crimean peninsula and separatist held regions of eastern Ukraine. Two Kharkiv residents react after a fresh wave of Russian shelling targeted the city In Kharkiv, which is 400km (249 miles) away in Ukraine's north-east, officials said three people had been killed and 21 injured in a new wave of attacks on the city. ""The intensity of the shelling of Kharkiv has increased,"" the regional governor Oleg Sinegubov said in a post on Telegram. Russia initially appeared to want to capture major Ukrainian cities and topple the country's government. But after facing stiff resistance, Russian defence officials said that its main objectives in the ""first stage of the operation"" had been ""generally accomplished"" and its forces were moved from areas around the capital. They announced plans to redirect the focus of the invasion towards the ""liberation"" of the mostly Russian-speaking Donbas region. Russia's President Vladmir Putin has portrayed the invasion as an attempt to demilitarise and ""denazify"" Ukraine, something Ukraine and its allies dismiss as a ruse for an unprovoked attack. Russian defence officials said its forces struck more than 1,200 targets in Ukraine on Monday night, including 25 military command posts in Mykolayiv and Kirovsk as well as two weapon depots in east Ukraine. Describing the fresh offensive in a television interview, Moscow's Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said ""another stage of this operation is beginning, and I'm sure this will be a very important moment."" First civilian deaths in Lviv shatter sense of safety Ukrainian leaders say Mariupol defenders will fight to the end Sunken Russian warship Moskva: What do we know? Speaking in a video message on Monday night, Mr Zelensky said that his forces had pledged to ""not give up anything Ukrainian"". ""A very large part of the entire Russian army is now focused on this offensive,"" he added, but said that Ukraine's forces will fight on ""no matter how many Russian troops are driven there, we will fight"". Moscow claimed last month that it controlled 93% of Luhansk and 54% of Donetsk and its forces are expected to try and encircle the remaining Ukrainian troops in the region. But they face a protracted fight with some of Kyiv's most battle-hardened troops. Ukraine is believed to have between 40-50,000 soldiers in the Donbas, many of whom have spent years fighting against Russian-backed separatists forces in the region. Ukraine is believed to have thousands of experienced troops in the Donbas The change in Russia's objectives was set out by President Vladimir Putin during a speech last week, where he announced that his aim was ""to help the people who live in the Donbas, who feel their unbreakable bond with Russia"". The Pentagon's press secretary, John Kirby, cautioned Russia could be ""setting the conditions for future offensive operations"" and officials in Kyiv warned that the new Russian offensive does not mean that Moscow has ended its attacks on other parts of Ukraine. ""Putin hasn't removed the goal to destroy us as a state and our political leadership,"" Mr Danilov said in an interview with Ukrainian TV.
