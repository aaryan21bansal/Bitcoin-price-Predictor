"A red carpet photocall - a regular sight in Cannes With theprizes given out, the bags packed and the hangovers kicking in, the 70th Cannes Film Festival has drawn to a close. This year's top prize went to surprise winner The Square, a Swedish film about the sometimes bonkers art world and how we can best help others. Cannes has seen dozens of film premieres and parties, and red carpet appearances from the likes of Rihanna, Bella Hadid and Kendall Jenner. Here are some of the highlights and talking points from the past 12 days. Kirsten Dunst was overwhelmed as she appeared on the red carpet The lack of sleep, the pressure, the importance of the occasion - who can blame festivalgoers for showing a bit of emotion? There wasn't a dry eye in the house during the press conference for Wonderstruck when the child actors said how much they'd learned from their adult co-stars - and vice versa. There may have been a few tears wiped away during the film's premiere itself too. Then there was the reaction toDustin Hoffman's performance inNoah Baumbach's The Meyerowitz Stories, which left both the actor and director weeping - and a fair proportion of the audience too. Some are tipping Hoffman for Oscars success for the role as a cantankerous patriarch at the centre of a dysfunctional New York family. Kirsten Dunstburst into tears on the red carpet for the premiere of The Beguiled - but the smiling reaction of directorSofia CoppolaandElle Fanning, who also appears in the Civil War-era drama, shows they were tears of happiness. Noah Baumbach, Emma Thompson and Ben Stiller had fun in Cannes Will Smithprovided the laughs at the jury press conference on the opening day of Cannes, heckling the audience, whooping with delight and even making a Fresh Prince of Bel Air reference. ThenEmma Thompsonwas also in a great mood when promoting The Meyerowitz Stories - and was later seen laughing and dancing, high heels in her hand, at the Hollywood Foreign Press Association party for the International Rescue Committee. And directorYorgos Lanthimostold the cast of his dark, intense thriller The Killing of the Sacred Deer it was a comedy. ButColin Farrelllaughed at this suggestion, saying Lanthimos, the man behind surreal romantic drama The Lobster, is ""messed up"". The Square actor Terry Notary reprised his performance as an ape-man on the red carpet, watched by co-stars including Elisabeth Moss and Dominic West Most shocking scene:When performance art being staged for paying guests' entertainment at a gala dinner pushes the boundaries of acceptable behaviour in The Square, as a man playing an ape makes things at first awkward and then horrifying Most incongruous use of a song in a film:When the strains of Annie's Song are heard as a giant pig runs amok in a shopping centre in Okja, all you can do is laugh Best/most creepy use of social media:The opening scenes to Michael Haneke's Happy End, in which an unseen character documents a woman's bedtime routine on a mobile phone - and later in the film, when the same phone records the demise of a hamster Most honest confession:Ben Stiller admitting he didn't know how to pronounce The Meyerowitz Stories either Most unlikely collaboration:Elisabeth Moss and Gwendoline Christie joking as they chatted before an interview that they'd like to develop a shoe range - and then they insisted holding hands throughout The 'It Should Have Won The Palme d'Or' prize:A tie between The Florida Project, starring Willem Dafoe, and Wind River, with Jeremy Renner and Elisabeth Olsen, both of which had critics scratching their heads as to why they weren't in the official competition Film fans, sometimes in tuxedos, holding signs asking for tickets for the day's films is a common sight along the Croisette, Cannes' main boulevard. Some got lucky - if someone had a spare ticket, it was preferable to give it away rather than get black-marked for the invitation not being taken up. Bonus points for those who at least made an effort with their appearance or made an amusing sign. Starting queuing for an 8.30am screening at 7.30am, not coming out of a 10pm screening until half past midnight... and then there are the beachfront parties that make partying seem like an Olympic sport, with one festivalgoer boasting she was planning to go to eight in one night. Caffeine does count as a food group, right?

The presence of virtual reality is getting bigger and bigger each year. The most high-profile example this year wasAlejandro Gonzalez Inarritu's installation Carne y Arena, a 20-minute shuttle ride away that required viewers to go into a hangar one by one. AndEric Darnell, who co-wrote and co-directed Madagascar, brought his latest project Rainbow Crow - starring the voice of John Legend - to the festival. The spotlight also turned to television, with new series of Top of the Lake and Twin Peaks debuting at the festival, which usually only celebrates the big screen. Some even saidJane Campion's crime drama Top of the Lake, which was shown in its six-hour entirety, was one of their festival highlights. Oakes Fegley and Jaden Michael in Wonderstruck Six of the 19 films in competition at Cannes were taken from books - ranging from Wonderstruck, based on Brian Selznick's half-illustrated young adult fiction book of the same name, to Joyce Carol Oates' Double Delight, which was turned into steamy L'amant Double. You have to feel for the film-makers bringing their babies, months and years in the making, into the merciless arena of Cannes. If an audience at Cannes likes something, they want you to know about it. And if they don't, there's no way you can escape their displeasure. We had boos during opening credits - for the Amazon logo at the beginning of Wonderstruck, and more loudly, for the Netflix logo ahead of its two films in competition. But applause greeted many of the other films, andRobert Pattinsonwas lucky enough to get a six-minute standing ovation at the end of the premiere for Good Time. Festival representatives gather for a minute's silence Terrorism was a shadow lingering over the festival well before news of the Manchester attack made its way to the festival, with heightened security involving scans, multiple ID checks and bag searches. This is near Nice after all, the site of the lorry attack last year. The attack that left 22 dead after an Ariana Grande concert meant there was a sombre atmosphere across the Cannes site. There was also a sense of solidarity, with foreign journalists giving heartfelt sympathies and people from around the world joining in a minute's silence. The red carpet, the scene of flashbulbs and photographers' shouts, was still as the Cannes president and French actress Isabelle Huppert were among those who took to the steps of the Palais - the hub of the festival - in a show of sympathy. The festival said it was an attack ""on culture, youth and joyfulness, on our freedom, generosity and tolerance, all things that the festival and those who make it possible - the artists, professionals and spectators - hold dear"". And in a nod to the work of those protecting the festival, this year'sPalme Dog,externalaward - the tongue-in-cheek prize given to the best dog at the festival - went to three security dogs, to represent the sniffer dogs around the world saving lives every day.

"Doan Thi Huong (in yellow T-shirt) and Siti Aisyah (right) have said they thought they were taking part in a TV prank The murder of Kim Jong-nam, the half brother of North Korea's leader, is likely to go down as one of the most notorious in history. Two women are now facing trial in Malaysia for it. Nga Pham of BBC Vietnamese and Rebecca Henschke of BBC Indonesian piece together their story. The CCTV footage from the departure lounge of Malaysia's Kuala Lumpur International Airport is unforgettable. A middle-aged man is approached from behind by two women who execute the most peculiar of manoeuvres, apparently wiping his face with vigour. Authorities say that was the moment that VX nerve agent, a deadly substance banned by the UN as a weapon of mass destruction, was used to murder Kim Jong-nam. The women are Indonesian Siti Aisyah, 25, and Vietnamese national Doan Thi Huong, 28. As the women bounded up to Mr Kim, they were being watched by a group of seated North Korean men, thought to have been their ""handlers"", who subsequently boarded flights to various destinations. Kim Jong-nam sought help at the airport shortly after his face was smeared with the deadly VX nerve agent Ms Aisyah and Ms Huong, meanwhile, were swiftly arrested, accused of carrying out this crime, although not planning it. They insist they thought it was all just a TV prank and made no plea when presented in court. But this is a crime that can carry the death sentence. This narrative is well known and has been rehearsed in the media incessantly, but what really brought them to this place? In the months before the killing, both women are thought to have been involved in the seedier side of Kuala Lumpur's life. Malaysian police have said Doan Thi Huong was working at an ""entertainment outlet"" and Siti Aisyah worked at the Flamingo hotel, a small establishment which has a massage parlour. Through all the references to their time in Malaysia in the media is the implication that the two may have been involved in the sex industry, but there has never been any direct evidence for this. The two women face the death penalty Doan Thi Huong appears to have had several Facebook pages under pseudonyms such as Ruby Ruby and Bella Tron Tron Bella. They show a woman both confident and carefree. They, as well as immigration records, appear to show a pattern of coming and going from Malaysia and various other regional locations, such as Phnom Penh and South Korea. Migrant workers, sex workers and those in the escort industry rub shoulders in Kuala Lumpur's red light districts. It is an international scene with workers from places such as China, Myanmar, Thailand, Laos and Cambodia, a fair number of whom are thought to enter the country on tourist visas. There is also a wide variety of work available for young women looking to earn money swiftly, taking roles such as guest relations officers in karaoke bars or in massage parlours or as escorts. The women's case has attracted intense media interest It is not clear if the women knew each other before the day of their arrests. Police claim they practised the manoeuvre several times in shopping malls, and they argue it was a calculated attack done in full knowledge of the consequences. The lawyer for Ms Huong, who has met her only once, told the BBC there was nothing in particular that stands out about her. And the journey of both these women to Kuala Lumpur is unexceptional. It comes via rural villages ringed with rice paddy fields and typical semi-rural upbringings. Indonesian Siti Aisyah grew up in Serang, Tangerang. It is just two hours' drive away from the high-rise buildings and glittering mega-malls of central Jakarta but it is another world. Siti Aisyah grew up in Serang, two hours from Jakarta Her parents are farmers who mainly sell potatoes and turmeric. The pace of life in Serang is slow, and people spend hours on their front porch talking to their neighbours. Siti Aisyah is the youngest of three siblings. She went to a state primary school, a short walk down the road from her home. Teachers at the school remember her as a ""quiet"" and ""polite girl"", and are all in shock at the turn of events. When the BBC visited the concrete playground it was packed with students in their neat red and white uniforms. They all knew Siti Aisyah's name. The unravelling of Kim Jong-nam's mysterious death Kim Jong-nam: Main players in mysterious killing Her education ended here as her parents could not afford to send her to high school. Doan Thi Huong had a similar start in life many hundreds of miles away in Vietnam, in a small house nested at the corner of a paddy field in Nghia Binh village. The village where Siti Aisyah grew up is a farming community The one-storey brick house is built in the typical Vietnamese rural style, with a tiny courtyard surrounded by thin banana trees. To get to the centre of the village, one has to brave the flimsy bamboo plank that serves as a bridge over a muddy creek between the house and the main road. This mainly Catholic area of Nam Dinh province, 90km (55 miles) from Hanoi, boasts a large number of churches and not much else. Most of the people here are farmers, working the exhausted soil of northern Vietnam, generation after generation. Ms Huong's family lives in a typical rural Vietnamese dwelling As in poor villages everywhere, young people are constantly on the lookout for opportunities to get to the cities, make money and have a better life than their parents. Ms Huong's father is a Vietnam war veteran who was injured in Quang Tri in 1972 and now works as a guard at the local market. Her mother died in 2015 and he remarried a woman from the same village last year. She too works at the market, helping him to look after visitors' bicycles and carts. ""Huong was never close to me,"" he told the BBC, adding that his daughter, the youngest of five, was perhaps closer to her late mother who was ill and bed-bound for decades. ""Then she left home at 18 and we rarely saw her back."" Interpol hunts N Koreans over Kim murder Malaysia and North Korea - a friendship on ice There have been no comments from the two women themselves. What is known about them comes from what their parents have told the media. Siti Aisyah's parents told local media that she was ""hardworking and determined"" and she wanted to get out of Serang even as a young girl. She wanted to be able to provide for her family.  Like millions of Indonesians from villagers like Serang, the only way she could do that was to go first to Jakarta and then overseas. It is a migrant worker's dream that girls like her grow up with. Siti Aisyah's father makes his living largely from potato and turmeric farming Doan Thi Huong went to a pharmaceutical college in Hanoi. But she then worked for a couple of ""entertainment outlets"" but never told them what exactly that entailed. ""She is a quiet, discreet person, very well behaved,"" said Ms Huong's older brother, Doan Van Binh. ""Huong doesn't seem to have much money but she would never steal even a toothpick from anybody!"" He did not realise that his little sister lived a very different life in the capital, Hanoi. Ms Huong transformed herself from a modest country girl into an exuberant young woman who worked in some of Hanoi's popular nightclubs and bars. She made one appearance on the Vietnam Idol competition. It lasted 20 seconds but her plunging neckline made headlines in the national press. She also used to work at a well-known bar-nightclub in central Hanoi called The Seventeen. The former manager of the bar, Kenny Bui, recalled that she was a good employee, simple but kind-hearted. Pictures of Ms Huong were widely circulated on Vietnamese social media in the weeks following her arrest ""She went out once with a bartender who I know very well and she paid for everything: his clothes, his food. She was very generous and never said anything bad even when other girls picked on her,"" Mr Bui said. Siti Aisyah married a businessman, Gunawan Hasyim, and they had one son together. They lived in the small house in the packed area of Tambora in West Jakarta. Neighbour Emma Suela told the BBC she remembers her as ""a very good girl. She really looked after her in-laws, she was very aware that she came from the village and from a poor background and she worked very hard"". Siti Aisyah (shown) and her co-accused were heavily guarded in court The couple divorced in 2012.  According to a handwritten letter dated 1 February, signed by Siti Aisyah and Gunawan, the couple had opted for a divorce as they no longer ""possessed the compatibility and harmony of husband and wife"". Emma says she and all the neighbours were shocked by the divorce and even more by her arrest. ""I am completely in shock.  It just doesn't make sense and is not the Aisyah I know. On television she looks really different, much more made-up, more beautiful and fancy. It's all very strange,"" she said. Her former father-in-law Lian Kiong told local media that the last time she came home was on 28 January, less than two weeks before the incident. ""She came and stayed for the night. She spent the night with my grandson and left the next day,"" he said. Siti Aisyah worked at the Flamingo hotel in Kuala Lumpur After The Seventeen closed in 2014, Ms Huong is believed to have worked as promotion girl and escort. Pictures of her wearing bikinis standing next to cars and in swimming pools were found on Vietnamese social media and internet forums.  She dyed her hair and went on numerous overseas trips with foreign clients. But she was was known for dating foreign men, mostly Koreans, as the bar was frequented by Korean clients. One of her numerous Facebook pages indicates that she even made a trip to Jeju island, the popular South Korean tourist destination. Siti Aisyah's family, on the other hand, insist she didn't speak Korean and had no connection to the country. Yet there has been a vast amount of speculation about the nature of the relationship between the two women and the North Korean men they were associated with, now believed to be spies who allegedly orchestrated the killing of Kim Jong-nam. Siti Aisyah's mother Benah says her daughter told her she had been offered work in Malaysia as a model.  ""She said she wanted to go to Malaysia for filming on a show to make people surprised by spraying perfume on somebody else,"" she said. ""She was offered a job by someone to become an advertisement model for perfume. And she's an innocent girl that did it because it was good money."" ""I'm asking and begging for help so that my daughter is not punished, as I believe she is innocent,"" her father Asria said when he heard the news. Ms Huong's father says he was never particularly close to his daughter Indonesian migrant groups have been vocal in insisting that Siti Aisyah, if she is found to be involved, is only a victim duped by more sophisticated and powerful forces. ""Her story is very similar to what has happened to many other migrants who were tricked by drug syndicates. They are caught and viewed as criminals but they are really victims. ""Half of the Indonesian migrants now on death row in Malaysia are such victims who were used as couriers by drug syndicates at airports,"" Anis Hisayat from Migrant Care says. But Malaysian police have long insisted that the women are very likely to have been far more complicit than they have so far claimed. They have said the women must have known what they were doing and were told to wash their hands afterwards. For now, the two women are at the mercy of the Malaysian courts.

"As British Airways (BA) finally starts to recover from a disastrous IT failure, an inquest is under way into what went wrong and why it has taken so long to fix it. I've been contacted by someone who spent 30 years in corporate IT with some interesting theories. The man - who doesn't want to be named - says airlines probably invest more in IT than any other organisations apart from banks, so this kind of thing just should not happen. But he has three questions. BA blames a power cut but in the words of my expert, it shouldn't have caused ""even a flicker of the lights"" in the data-centre. The UPS - the uninterruptible power supply - should have kicked in immediately. The only issue should have been making sure the back-up generator was kept fed with fuel. Even if the power could not be restored, the airline's Disaster Recovery Plan should have whirred into action.  But that will have depended in part on veteran staff with knowledge of the complex patchwork of systems built up over the years. Many of those people may have left when much of the IT operation was outsourced to India. And there may have been a situation where one team was frantically trying to restore the original system while elsewhere another team was attempting to fire up the back-up - with managers unsure which of the two workstreams to prioritise. One theory of my IT veteran is that when the power came back on, the systems were unusable because the data was unsynchronised. In other words the airline was suddenly faced with a mass of conflicting records of passengers, aircraft and baggage movements - all the complex logistics of modern air travel. He says: ""This would have meant that BA would need to restore to a known synchronised back-up point (potentially days old), which brings in the previous argument about the hands-on skills required to achieve this."" In summary, complex IT systems do fail from time to time, but smart organisations have the people and processes in place to recover quickly. BA has said little so far about what went wrong. However, it will now be under pressure from investors, staff and passengers to provide some answers.

"This video can not be played Finland has one of the best education systems in the world. Finland has long been renowned for the quality of its education and always scores highly in international league tables. Now it is rethinking how it teaches in the digital age - seeking to place skills, as much as subjects, at the heart of what it does. But not everyone is happy, and there are fears it could bring down standards. It is a chilly morning in a remote village in southern Finland, but the thoughts of this class of 12-year-olds are elsewhere - in ancient Rome. Their teacher is taking them through a video re-enactment - shown on the classroom's interactive smart board - of the day Mount Vesuvius erupted and destroyed the city of Pompeii. In groups they take out their mini laptops. Their task is to compare ancient Rome with modern Finland. One group looks at Roman baths and today's luxury spas; another puts the Colosseum up against modern-day stadiums. They use 3D printers to create a miniature of their Roman building, which will eventually be used as pieces for a class-wide board game. This is a history lesson with a difference, says Aleksis Stenholm, a teacher at Hauho Comprehensive School. The children are also gaining skills in technology, research, communication and cultural understanding. ""Each group is becoming an expert on their subject, which they will present to the class,"" he explains. The board game is the culmination of the project, which will run alongside normal classroom teaching. For nearly two decades, Finland has enjoyed a reputation for having one of the world's best education systems. Its 15 year olds regularly score amongst the highest in the globalPisa,externalleague tables for reading, maths and science. Exercise balls replace chairs in this classroom at Hauho school Its ability to produce high academic results in children who do not start formal schooling until the age of seven, have short school days, long holidays, relatively little homework and no exams, has long fascinated education experts around the world. Despite this, Finland is shaking up the way it is doing things - a move that it says is vital in a digital age where children are no longer reliant on books and the classroom to gain knowledge. In August 2016 it became compulsory for every Finnish school to teach in a more collaborative way; to allow students to choose a topic relevant to them and base subjects around it. Making innovative use of technology and sources outside the school, such as experts and museums, is a key part of it. The aim of this way of teaching - known as project- or phenomenon-based learning (PBL) - is to equip children with skills necessary to flourish in the 21st Century, says Kirsti Lonka, a professor of educational psychology at Helsinki University. Among the skills she singles out are critical thinking to identify fake news and avoid cyber-bullying, and the technical ability to install anti-virus software and link up to a printer. The school at Hauho is relaxed about the children using their mobile phones in class as well as in the lunch hour ""Traditionally, learning has been defined as a list of subject matters and facts you need to acquire - such as arithmetic and grammar - with some decoration, like citizenship, built in around it,"" Ms Lonka says. ""But when it comes to real life, our brain is not sliced into disciplines in that way; we are thinking in a very holistic way. And when you think about the problems in the world - global crises, migration, the economy, the post-truth era - we really haven't given our children the tools to deal with this inter-cultural world. ""I think it is a major mistake if we lead children to believe the world is simple and that if they learn certain facts they are ready to go. So learning to think, learning to understand, these are important skills - and it also makes learning fun, which we think promotes wellbeing."" Hauho Comprehensive School is nestled among forests and lakes, some 40 minutes drive north-east of the city of Hameenlinna. With just 230 pupils aged between seven and 15, it has a homely feel. Shoes are left at the front entrance, exercise balls are used instead of chairs in some classrooms, and there are pull-up bars in the doorways. Teachers are relaxed about mobile phones in the classroom; it is a chance, they say, for children to appreciate their value as a research tool, not just as a means for communicating with their friends. The school's skate park came from an idea suggested by the children, who helped design and raise funds for it On this cold day, the older students huddle around their phones during the lunch hour while some of the younger children brave the snow flurries to use the skate park, football and basketball pitches. Head teacher Pekka Paappanen is a firm believer in PBL and looks for a variety of ways of integrating it into the school's curriculum. ""I talk through ideas with our teachers, and then I make sure there is time and space in the schedule for them to happen,"" he explains. ""I think teachers have more power in this way, but they have to realise they can't do everything. We are leaving some old traditions behind, but we are taking it slowly too - the job of teaching our children is too important and we mustn't get it wrong."" One big project last year was on the subject of immigration, when the flow of migrants into Europe was making headlines around the world. The children linked up with German pupils to compare their understanding of immigration Aleksis Stenholm says they chose the topic because it became clear many of their students had little personal experience of immigrants and immigration. The topic was incorporated into German and religious classes. Their 15-year-olds carried out street surveys to garner local opinions about immigration, and they visited a nearby immigration centre to interview asylum seekers. They shared their findings via video-link with a school in Germany, which had carried out a similar project. ""It was really powerful, how the students reacted to it. They started thinking about things, questioning their opinions,"" Mr Stenholm recalls. ""If I had just taught this over, say, the course of three lessons, the effect would have been very different."" The idea behind phenomenon-based learning has its critics. Some, like physics teacher Jussi Tanhuanpaa, fear it does not provide children with a strong enough grounding in a subject to enable them to study it at a higher level. He teaches in Lieto, just outside the south-west city of Turku, and says that of one cohort of children he knew who took advanced-level maths post-16, some 30% of them had to drop down a level. He also worries it is widening the gap between the most and least able students - a gap that has been historically small in Finland. A smart board and tablet computers are used for this lesson on climate change ""This way of teaching is great for the brightest children who understand what knowledge they need to take away from an experiment. It allows them the freedom to learn at their own pace and take the next steps when they are ready to,"" he says. ""But this is not the case for children who are less able to figure it out for themselves and need more guidance. The gap between the brightest and the less able has already begun widening and I am very afraid that this will only get worse"". Pens and paper are still an important part of classroom life Others worry that it is also adding to teachers' workloads and is disadvantaging older teachers who may not be as digitally able as their younger counterparts. Jari Salminen of Helsinki University's faculty of education says similar types of learning have been tried in the past - as far back as 100 years ago - and have failed. ""Many international visitors are asking me, why are you changing this system when you get such good results? And it's a mystery to me, because we don't have any data from school level that phenomenon-based learning is improving results,"" Mr Salminen says. .... so too are arts and crafts Anneli Rautiainen ofFinland's national agency for education,externalaccepts there are concerns and says they are introducing the changes gradually: schools are only required to provide one such PBL project for its pupils a year. ""We want to encourage teachers to work in this way and for children to experience it, but we are starting it slowly. There are still subjects being taught and goals to be reached for each subject, but we also want skills to be embedded in that learning,"" she explains. But what about results? ""We are not too keen on metrics in this country overall so we are not planning to measure the success of it, at least not for now. We are hoping it will show in the learning outcomes of our children as well as in the international tables such as Pisa,"" she says. Teaching is a highly respected, well-paid profession There are no school inspections or teacher evaluations The school system is highly centralised and most schools are publicly funded School days are short and the summer break is 10 weeks Children are assessed by their teachers. The only nationwide exam is for those who continue studying to 18 Average school size is 195 pupils; average class size is 19 pupils Success has been attributed to a traditionally high regard for teaching and reading, as well as a small, largely homogenous population Though still high, Finland has been slipping down the Pisa rankings in recent years Like other nations, it faces challenges of financial constraints and growing immigration While not everyone is convinced by this revolution in Finnish teaching, it has been given the thumbs up by most students and parents at Hauho. Sara, 14, says it is ""not so tiring. It's much more interesting - I like that about it"". Anna, also 14, says her older sister is envious because she thinks ""school is much more fun than when she was here"". Mum Kaisa Kepsu says most parents she knows are positive about the changes to the curriculum. ""There has been a wider discussion about the need to ensure children are still learning the basic facts, and I agree with that,"" she says. ""But raising their motivation and making the world more interesting is also important. I don't see anything wrong with school being fun"". Some project-based learning does happen in UK schools already, says Tom Bennett, the government's classroom behaviour adviser, but on a much smaller scale than that planned for Finland. And it is likely to remain that way, he says, as there is no compelling evidence that it is a more efficient way of teaching. The Education Endowment Foundation (EEF)funded a trial of PBL,externalthat involved mixed-ability Year 7 children in 24 UK schools between 2014 and 2016. The findings were skewed because a large number of schools dropped out of the study, largely because of the high level of management support and organisational change needed. The trial found no evidence that PBL had a positive impact on pupils' literacy or their engagement with school and learning, the EEF said. However, the independent evaluators did find that - from observations and feedback from schools - it could enhance pupils' skills in communication, teamwork and self-managed study.

"Skanska diversity manager Israil Bryan (l) says returnships have helped the construction company to plug some skills shortages There are plenty of things on a CV that can put off recruiters. Having a gap on your work history shouldn't be one of them - but the challenges faced by women returning to the workplace costs the UK an estimated Â£1.7bn a year in lost economic output. So what can be done to address this black hole? Julianne Miles co-founded Women Returners to connect firms with candidates who want to get back into work but have a lengthy gap on their CV. Like an internship, a ""returnship"" is a placement at a company ranging from six weeks to six months. Where it differs is that returners come in at a paid, high level position following a minimum of two years out of the workplace. Formerly a high-level marketing executive for Diageo, Julianne took a four-year career break when her children were born before retraining as a psychologist. Her initial goal for Women Returners was to counteract the negative stereotypes surrounding career breaks. ""We were initially driven by the social goal of making sure a career break didn't mean career suicide. I was aware that everything you read at the time was very negative - that if you took a break you couldn't get back into a high-level corporate role.  And you could see the reality of that [on the ground] - it was very hard to get back in."" She points out that the ""career break penalty"" means it's not just the economy that is getting a raw deal. Chartered psychologist Julianne Miles founded Women Returners after taking a break from the workplace and changing careers Almost half a million professional women who are currently on care-related career breaks are likely to come back to work in the future.  Of those, three in five will move into a lower skilled or lower paid role than the job they had before, reducing their earnings by up to a third, according to PwC research last year. A further 29,000 will be underemployed - not working as many hours as they would like to. If this penalty was addressed it would add an average of Â£4,000 on to the salary of each returner. But Women Returners is not a charitable initiative.  Julianne estimates the hiring rate following each programme is 50-85% and points out the companies involved gain access to an untapped pool of talent. What's more, the multiplier effect of their combined Â£1.1bn in extra earnings and increased spending power would lead to a Â£1.7bn increase in UK economic output. Yet only a tiny fraction of companies offer these schemes. Tania Ash has just joined Enfield Council's six-month returnship programme as a web architect. After 20 years working in software development for private companies, she took two years out to care for her father, who had been diagnosed with dementia, and look after her baby daughter. Tania Ash found it hard to rejoin the IT industry after taking time out to spend with daughter Marie ""I have a business background and when I decided to continue my career I was looking for an opportunity with flexible working hours,"" she says. ""It was really hard to find that in the IT industry because it's very rapid, so this was a great opportunity for me to return to the industry."" And not all returners are sitting behind a desk. Engineer Kate Young, 37, took a seven-year career break before starting her placement at Skanska last year when her younger child started school. She has since become a senior engineer at the company. ""The Skanska job was the first to hit all the boxes. It was part-time, location-wise it was flexible and it was relevant to my engineering skills,"" she says. ""I had heard some horror stories from people with big gaps in their CV where the initial [recruitment] filter just puts them straight in the bin."" But she says a returnship is ""good for both sides"". ""Going in for three months on a returnship means people do not expect you to immediately get there, and they know you have your family life. You know that if it's a disaster you can think, 'well, I've tried it and it doesn't work right now,' so it takes the pressure off."" Kate Young is now employed by Skanska as a senior engineer The Skanska returnship is open to both women and men who have had a career break. Israil Bryan, the firm's diversity and social programme manager, says running a returnship programme has helped Skanska solve many problems. ""There is a lack of diversity in the construction industry, and there are skill gaps in some core technical areas like engineering and quantity surveying,"" she says. ""Within Skanska we sought to address both these things - to bring quality people into our business but also people from other industries with core skills that could complement us."" There are many reasons why people find themselves taking a career break. Natalie Lang, 49, left her 20-year career in financial services to set up her own childcare business. When she decided to return to the City, recruiters were reluctant to take her on. ""When I started looking for jobs and I was dealing with recruiters, they were very reluctant to put my CV forward when there were other candidates already doing the job, because they felt they had a better chance of getting the position,"" she says. But Natalie found financial services firm Fidelity's returner programme online, and now has a permanent role at the company as a business risk manager. ""Recruiters were reluctant to put my CV forward,"" says Natalie Lang While Julianne Miles's Women Returners project is still relatively small-scale, it is undeniably gaining momentum. The number of programmes offered have grown from three in 2014 to 27 announced for 2017 so far. In the March 2017 Budget, the government allocated Â£5m for ""return to work"" schemes. But what our society should aim for, Julianne says, is for returnships to become less significant, as the attitude towards career breaks becomes more accepting. ""It's not just about returners - it's about opening the minds of companies to people who have had career breaks more broadly. ""I would like to see returnships continue because it reduces risks on both sides but we are also bringing these role models into organisations. There are only a tiny percentage of people in organisations that have taken career breaks so people can see them and think, 'why are we prejudiced against people who have taken career breaks?'""

"We don't tend to think of lifts as mass transportation systems, but that's what they are. They move hundreds of millions of people every day, and China alone is thought to be installing 660,000 lifts a year. The tallest building in the world, Dubai's Burj Khalifa, has more than 300,000 sq m (3.2 million sq ft) of floor space. The brilliantly engineered Sears Tower in Chicago has more than 400,000. Imagine slicing such skyscrapers into 50 or 60 low-rise chunks, then surrounding each chunk with a car park and connecting all the car parks together with roads. You'd have an office park the size of a small town. The fact that so many people can work together in huge buildings on compact sites is only possible because of the lift. 50 Things That Made the Modern Economyhighlights the inventions, ideas and innovations that have helped create the economic world. It is broadcast on the BBC World Service. You can findmore information about the programme's sourcesandlisten onlineorsubscribe to the programme podcast. Or, perhaps we should say, because of the safety lift. Lifts themselves have existed for a long time. Archimedes is said to have built one in ancient Greece. In 1743, at the Palace of Versailles, Louis XV used one for clandestine visits to and from his mistress. The king's bed chamber in Versailles was linked to that of his mistress via a secret lift The power for Louis's secret love-lift was supplied by a chap in a chimney breast, standing ready to haul on a rope when required. Other lifts in Hungary, China and Egypt were powered by animals. Steam power went further. Matthew Boulton and James Watt - giants of Britain's industrial revolution - produced steam engines that ran muscular industrial lifts that hauled coal up from the mines. But while these lifts worked well enough, you wouldn't want to use them to lift people to any serious height, because - inevitably - something would go wrong. The lift would plunge down the shaft, loose ends of the rope flapping in the darkness, passengers screaming into oblivion. Most people can walk up five flights of stairs if they must. Nobody would want to take a lift to such a deadly height. So what mattered was making a lift that was not only safe, but demonstrably safe. Both the innovation and the demonstration fell to a man named Elisha Otis. At the 1853 World's Fair in New York, Otis climbed on to a platform, which was hoisted high above a crowd of onlookers nervy with anticipation. The entire contraption looked a little like an executioner's scaffold. Behind Otis stood a man with an axe. He swung down on to the rope, the crowd gasped, Otis' platform shuddered - but did not plunge. ""All safe, gentlemen, all safe,"" boomed Otis. The city landscape was about to be turned on its head by the man who had invented not the lift, but the lift brake. ""Turned on its head"" is right, because the lift transformed where a building's highest status areas were located. When the furthest reaches of a six- or seven-storey building were accessed only after an arduous climb, they tended to be the servants' quarters or the artist's garret. After the lift, the attic became the loft apartment, the penthouse. New York's underground system is symbiotically linked to the city's lift-laden skyscrapers The lift flourished alongside two complementary sets of innovations: the steel and reinforced concrete that made it practical to build tall buildings, and the undergrounds and other mass transit systems that could bring large numbers of people into dense urban cores. In the quintessential high-rise centre, Manhattan, lifts and the underground are symbiotic. Without the density that the skyscrapers provide, it would be hard to run an underground system efficiently. Without the underground system, nobody would be able to get to the skyscrapers. The result is a surprisingly green urban environment: more than 80% of Manhattanites travel to work on the underground, or by bike or on foot, 10 times the rate for America as a whole. A similar story can be told for high-rise cities across the planet, from Singapore to Sydney. They tend to be highly desirable places to live - as witnessed by people's willingness to pay high rents. They're creative, as measured by a large output of patents and a high rate of start-ups. They're rich, as measured by economic output per person. And relative to rural and suburban areas, they are environmental utopias, with low rates of energy use per person and low consumption of petrol. How a razor revolutionised the way we pay for stuff Rise of the robots: What advances mean for workers Battery bonanza: From frogs' legs to mobiles and electric cars Superstar economics: How the gramophone changed everything This minor miracle - wealth and vitality in a modest environmental footprint - would be impossible without the lift. Yet the lift seems unfairly underrated. We hold it to a higher standard than other forms of transport. We're pleased if we only have to wait a couple of minutes for a bus or a train, but we grumble if we have to wait 20 seconds for a lift. Many people are nervous of lifts, yet they are safe - at least 10 times safer than escalators. Frankly, the lift is a faithful servant that is too often ignored. Perhaps -as Nick Paumgarten once suggested in the New Yorker magazine,external- this is because using a lift feels almost like being teleported: the doors close, there is a shift in the feeling of gravity, the doors open again and you're somewhere else. There is so little sense of place that without signs and LED displays, we wouldn't have a clue which floor we were emerging into. While we take the lift for granted, it continues to evolve. The challenges of ever taller skyscrapers are being met by super-light lift ropes, and by computer controllers that will allow two cars to shuttle up and down a single shaft independently, one above the other. But often the older, simpler ideas still work: for example, making the wait for a lift pass more quickly by putting full length mirrors in the lobby. And lifts are naturally energy efficient because their cars have counterweights. There's always room for improvement, of course. The Empire State Building - still the most iconic skyscraper in the world - was recently retrofitted in a $500m (Â£387m) project effort to reduce the building's carbon emissions. The Empire State Building's 68 lifts were recently overhauled by the company founded by Elisha Otis, which installed the original system in 1931 The retrofit included lifts with regenerative brakes, so that when a full car comes down or an empty car heads up, the lift supplies power back to the building. But the truth is that the Empire State Building was always energy efficient by the simple virtue of being a densely packed vertical structure next to an underground station. One of the organisations that designed the building's retrofit is visionary environmental organisation the Rocky Mountain Institute, whose super-efficient, environmentally sustainable headquarters, doubling as a showcase home for founder Amory Lovins, was built high in the Rockies, 180 miles (290km) from the nearest public transit system. The RMI has expanded and staff take pains to use bikes, buses and electric cars to get to work and many meetings are done by teleconferencing. And the RMI is a showcase for environmentally efficient design ideas - including high-tech window coatings, krypton-filled triple-glazing, a water-reuse system and energy-saving heat exchanges. But one of the most environmentally friendly technologies is on display in buildings all around us. It's a green mode of transport that moves billions of people every year - and yet is so overlooked that it can hide in plain sight.

"When BBC correspondent Secunder Kermani wanted to get a haircut in Pakistan, he decided to head to Mirpur, in Pakistan-administered Kashmir. It was the one city where he could be sure of getting the same cut he normally has in London. As I waited outside the blast-proof walls of my hotel in Islamabad, a short, moustached security guard with a friendly face wandered over. ""Are you from the UK?"" he asked in Urdu. I told him I was. My family is originally from Pakistan, but I was born in London. ""So you're from Mirpur are you?"" I smiled - the city of Mirpur is known as Little England here, because so many of its inhabitants left for Britain, only to return to build big houses with the money they've saved - or to marry off their children. ""No, my family aren't from there,"" I told him. He pointed at my head, ""But your hairstyle - all the Mirpuris have the same one."" To explain - I have what's called a skin fade, the sides of my head shaved to varying degrees. Down by my ear, there's barely any hair - then it gradually gets longer as you go upwards - at the top of my head it's a normal, longer length. It's a very common cut in parts of Britain - particularly amongst British Asians. In Pakistan though, most men have much simpler hairstyles. I wasn't sure if the security guard liked my hair. But at least, I thought, I know where I can find a good barber. My first haircut in Pakistan would be in Mirpur, I resolved. From Our Own Correspondenthas insight and analysis from BBC journalists, correspondents and writers from around the world Listen on iPlayer, getthe podcastor listen on the BBC World Service or on Radio 4 on Thursdays at 11:00 BST and Saturdays at 11:30 BST I was rather disappointed by Mirpur at first - it looked like most other Pakistani cities I had been to - but I got excited when I saw a sign advertising Chicken Cottage, a fried chicken brand from Britain that young British Muslims often visit as a halal alternative to McDonalds. And it was true - every other guy there under the age of 40 seemed to be sporting a skin fade. It was impossible to tell whether they were British Pakistanis or locals. In the 1960s, thousands of Mirpuris left to work in the factories and mills of cities like Bradford and Birmingham - some estimate that about 70% of all British Pakistanis can trace their origins to the region. Practically every household there has relatives in England, I was told, so when cousins visit from the UK young Mirpuris copy their style. My guide was a local YouTube star - Arslan Shabir - who has built an online following in both countries. Arslan with fans, taking a selfie Aside from his crisp whiteshalwar kameez(traditional tunic and pleated trousers) he looks every inch the urban Brit. The sides of his hair are completely shaved; he has his initials tattooed on the back of his neck, a fake diamond earring, and a cheeky smile accentuated by a gold tooth. But when he opens his mouth he speaks a thick local dialect I can barely follow. We follow him to what he says is Mirpur's premier barbers.  A stylish young man is having his designer stubble plucked with tweezers - hair by hair - so the edges of his beard form a perfectly straight line. Both he and the barber also have skin fade haircuts. Raja - the man being plucked - tells me the style may have originated in Britain, but it's now become identifiably Mirpuri, instantly recognisable.  He has never been to England himself, but has relatives in Birmingham. ""Do I look like a Pakistani?"" he asks me, as he flicks through a gallery of selfies on his phone. ""Could you tell me apart from any British kid?"" He's clearly proud to look like one. Barbers in Mirpur offer the distinctive skin fade hairstyle But the guys here have a complex relationship with Britain. One customer tells me how he was fleeced out of a small fortune by a girl in Leeds who claimed she would marry him. Like many in Mirpur who see their relatives building large homes or businesses with their savings from Britain, he hoped he could find work in the UK. But she took his money and disappeared. Another in the salon is due to get married in a few months - to his cousin in England. Some of Arslan Shabir's videos criticise British Pakistanis for the way they talk about their Pakistani cousins.  ""Freshie"" means fresh off the boat - a recent immigrant who doesn't know anything about life in Britain.   ""Mangy"" is short for amangetar -a fiance - in other words, someone who only got into the country because of an arranged marriage. Mirpur's connection with Britain has made it a place quite unlike anywhere else in the region. You can see it in the huge villas. ""Where could I get a place like this in the UK?"" says Zahoor from Ilford, as we crane our necks to get a full view of his dazzling palatial creation, complete with terraces and towers. How the city of Mirpur became 'Little England' Arslan says he gets on well with most British Pakistanis, and as he showed me round his hometown we were stopped by three fans from Bradford.  Sauntering around with sunglasses and cigarettes and posing for pictures, they looked like they could be on a lads' holiday in Magaluf - except two of them were in shalwar kameez. Arslan clearly loves the attention - and perhaps the validation - from these British fans. But he says he also resents those British Pakistanis who look down on their freshie or mangy cousins.  ""Where do they think their parents come from?"" he says indignantly. ""The same place as us."" Back at the barbers and it's my turn. As he brandishes an electric razor, Irfan tells me that he was the first in Mirpur to start offering skin fades. ""The other day,"" he boasts, ""a British customer was so impressed he offered me a jobâ¦ in London.""

"One man and his dog; Noakes with Shep John Noakes was the action man of Blue Peter. His daredevil stunts were a major feature in what many saw as the programme's golden years. He became famous for his relationship with Shep, the dog that would never get down. But he later claimed his television persona was faked and was a bitter critic of the programme's culture under its long-serving editor, Biddy Baxter. He was born John Bottomley, the son of a mill worker, on 6 March 1934 in the village of Shelf, close to Halifax in Yorkshire. His parents divorced when he was nine, and Noakes lived with his grandmother before going to a local fee-paying school, on a scholarship. He quarrelled with his father and left home at 16 to join the RAF as a mechanic. A year later he changed his surname to Noakes, after a well-known Canadian trumpeter of the time, Alfie Noakes, who became his stepfather.  In the few interviews that he did, Noakes always refused to reveal his original surname on the grounds he didn't like it. Noakes (r) in what many consider Blue Peter's classic presenter line-up He left the RAF and went to work at Heathrow as an aircraft fitter for BOAC but he was already becoming interested in acting. A series of mundane jobs provided the money to attend acting school and he made his first professional appearance in a summer show with Cyril Fletcher. He spent six months in the Broadway production of Arnold Wesker's Chips with Everything before moving back to work in rep in Surrey, where he met his wife, Vicky. In 1965 he was appearing in a play in Leicester when Blue Peter's editor, Biddy Baxter, spotted his photograph in a local paper. At the age of 31, ancient by the standards of modern children's presenters, he passed the audition making his first appearance on 30 December 1965. He became instantly recognisable, not least because his Yorkshire accent was at odds with the Received Pronunciation that was the norm in the 1960s BBC. His first task was to conquer the nervousness engendered by having to perform on live TV so he decided to invent a character behind which he could hide. ""Idiot Noakes has an extrovert personality, is light-hearted and jokey. A bit of a buffoon who would do anything for a laugh or a few pence. I switch the personality on when I turn up to do the job, and off when I leave."" An elephant with a weak bladder was a classic Noakes moment He never stopped being an actor. In later years he admitted that the incontinent baby elephant, one of the programme's more memorable moments, had not actually stood on his foot as he pretended at the time. Noakes initially teamed up with two existing presenters, Christopher Trace and Valerie Singleton. When Trace left, he was replaced by Peter Purves, completing what many fans claim was the classic Blue Peter presenter line-up. Where Purves was the school swot and Singleton the prim head girl, Noakes was the boy at the back of the class disrupting the lesson. He threw himself into the various challenges which came his way; white-water rafting, climbing the mast at HMS Ganges and travelling up the Amazon were some of the high spots. One white-knuckle ride on a bobsleigh down the Cresta Run resulted in a crash which left him bruised and concussed after finishing the descent on his backside. And he entered the Guinness Book of Records after becoming the first civilian in Britain to make a five-mile-high freefall parachute drop with the RAF. Noakes in freefall in 1973 He had no fear of heights and, in one memorable broadcast, climbed Nelson's Column on a series of rickety wooden ladders in order to help workmen clean up pigeon mess. Like other presenters he was expected to have an animal and, in 1966, Patch arrived in the studio, the son of Petra, another Blue Peter dog. Patch died suddenly at the age of five and Noakes broke down in tears when he went on set to give his young audience the sad news. But Patch's demise opened the door for Shep, an enthusiastic black-and-white border collie who became Noakes's new companion. The new dog was as excitable as his master's alter ego and Noakes's cries of ""Get down, Shep"" became a familiar catchphrase. During his final two years with the programme, he travelled the country with Shep in a series called Go With Noakes but, behind the scenes at Blue Peter, a furious row was developing between Noakes and his editor, Biddy Baxter. A formidable character, she had very clear ideas of how her presenters should behave, refusing to allow them any editorial input and insisting they work from scripts rather than an autocue. His stunts became a feature of the programme His co-presenter, Valerie Singleton, later recalled in an interview that Noakes was the only person capable of standing up to Biddy Baxter and getting away with it. Noakes complained of long hours and poor pay, later saying that he had once worked for a nine-week period with just a day and a half off. The demands were huge; a twice-weekly live programme coupled with a punishing schedule of location films all took their toll. His feud with Baxter would continue to simmer. In 2008 he initially turned down an invitation to attend a reception at Buckingham Palace to mark 50 years of Blue Peter. ""Biddy was a very difficult woman,"" he said. ""She was a bully who treated me like some country yokel from Yorkshire. I couldn't abide her then, so I won't pretend I am looking forward to rubbing shoulders with her now."" He finally relented after the Queen sent him a personal message naming him as her favourite presenter. Baxter herself, who has received high praise for making Blue Peter into the success it was, has always denied knowledge of any rift between Noakes and herself. Noakes (c) reunited with the old team in 2000 Noakes quit the programme in 1978 sparking a huge row over the future of his partnership with Shep. He had been told he would be allowed to keep the dog, which technically belonged to the BBC, but he was not to use Shep in any future advertising. Once he had left, Noakes duly recruited a similar-looking dog to do a series of pet food commercials. After leaving Blue Peter, Noakes worked for a further 18 months on Go With Noakes, before setting off with his wife on a round-the-world yacht trip. The couple's voyage ended when their boat was badly damaged by a giant wave off the coast of North Africa and they ended up in Mallorca, where they eventually made a home. Noakes continued with some television work, presenting a 1983 children's documentary series for ITV but he failed to make it back into the mainstream. There was one memorable and tearful appearance on a BBC programme called Fax in 1987 where he announced the death, a few days before, of his beloved Shep. He was reunited with Purves and Singleton in 2000 when the three came together to dig up a time capsule that they had buried during a Blue Peter episode in 1971.

"Novak Djokovic beat Andy Murray to win the French Open last year French Open Venue:Roland Garros, ParisDates:28 May-11 June Coverage:Listen to live radio commentary and follow text coverage of selected matches on BBC Radio 5 live sports extra and online. Novak Djokovic won his first match under new coach Andre Agassi, while Rafael Nadal took a first step towards his 10th title at the French Open. Defending champion Djokovic, who split with his coaching team last month, beat Spain's Marcel Granollers 6-3 6-4 6-2. Asked about Agassi, the Serb said: ""He has a lot to share with me outside and inside of the tennis lines. I'm really enjoying it so far."" Nadal saw off Frenchman Benoit Paire 6-1 6-4 6-1 with little trouble. ""Always at the start, I'm happy for the victory,"" said the Spaniard. ""It was not an easy opponent in the first round, obviously. ""He's an uncomfortable opponent that already had some good victories this year. I came on court with a lot of respect."" Elsewhere, Canadian fifth seedMilos Raonicbeat Belgium's Steve Darcis 6-3 6-4 6-2. Seventh seedMarin Cilicis also through after he won 6-3 6-3 6-3 against Ernests Gulbis. But ninth seedAlexander Zverevof Germany, who beat Djokovic to win theItalian Open,will have to return on Tuesday to continue his match against Spain's Fernando Verdasco after rain and failing light brought an end to their contest with the score tied at one set all. Live scores and schedule Bedene reaches second round Djokovic, 30, was out early on Philippe Chatrier Court practising under the watchful eye of new coach Agassi, and he returned a few hours later to get their first win on the board. It was hardly vintage Djokovic, with the second seed making 29 unforced errors and falling to convert 12 break points. He needed eight chances just to clinch the second set as he eventually made it through after two hours and 27 minutes of hard work in sweltering conditions. For Agassi it was a successful, if not entirely comfortable, return to the court where he completed his career Grand Slam in 1999. At one point there was a chance to catch up with old rival Boris Becker, the man he replaced as Djokovic's coach, that partnership producing six Grand Slam titles. Djokovic's former coach Boris Becker wished new coach Agassi good luck The Las Vegan is only scheduled to stay in Paris until the end of this week before he has to leave for other prior engagements. ""I'm going to try to use the time spent with him as best as I can, as best as we can,"" said Djokovic. ""So far plenty of information, plenty of things to kind of process. ""I think this is exactly what I need at this moment, a person like him that understands the transitions as a tennis player and as a person as well, going through these kind of lifestyle and certain choices that you make, how that affects you later on."" Nadal, 30, was up against the crowd as much as his opponent as he took on Frenchman Paire on the lively Suzanne Lenglen Court. The fourth seed was himself given a huge ovation as his list of title wins stretching back to 2005 was read out, and he dominated for the most part. An unexpected rash of errors early in the second set allowed Paire into the match, and the world number 45 had a break point to lead 5-3, but Nadal snuffed out the danger and powered home. ""For me, it's important to serve a little bit better than I did today,"" said Nadal. ""The rest of the things I am happy with.""

"Novak Djokovic beat Andy Murray to win the French Open last year French Open Venue:Roland Garros, ParisDates:28 May-11 June Coverage:Listen to live radio commentary and follow text coverage of selected matches on BBC Radio 5 live sports extra and online. Novak Djokovic won his first match under new coach Andre Agassi, while Rafael Nadal took a first step towards his 10th title at the French Open. Defending champion Djokovic, who split with his coaching team last month, beat Spain's Marcel Granollers 6-3 6-4 6-2. Asked about Agassi, the Serb said: ""He has a lot to share with me outside and inside of the tennis lines. I'm really enjoying it so far."" Nadal saw off Frenchman Benoit Paire 6-1 6-4 6-1 with little trouble. ""Always at the start, I'm happy for the victory,"" said the Spaniard. ""It was not an easy opponent in the first round, obviously. ""He's an uncomfortable opponent that already had some good victories this year. I came on court with a lot of respect."" Elsewhere, Canadian fifth seedMilos Raonicbeat Belgium's Steve Darcis 6-3 6-4 6-2. Seventh seedMarin Cilicis also through after he won 6-3 6-3 6-3 against Ernests Gulbis. But ninth seedAlexander Zverevof Germany, who beat Djokovic to win theItalian Open,will have to return on Tuesday to continue his match against Spain's Fernando Verdasco after rain and failing light brought an end to their contest with the score tied at one set all. Live scores and schedule Bedene reaches second round Djokovic, 30, was out early on Philippe Chatrier Court practising under the watchful eye of new coach Agassi, and he returned a few hours later to get their first win on the board. It was hardly vintage Djokovic, with the second seed making 29 unforced errors and falling to convert 12 break points. He needed eight chances just to clinch the second set as he eventually made it through after two hours and 27 minutes of hard work in sweltering conditions. For Agassi it was a successful, if not entirely comfortable, return to the court where he completed his career Grand Slam in 1999. At one point there was a chance to catch up with old rival Boris Becker, the man he replaced as Djokovic's coach, that partnership producing six Grand Slam titles. Djokovic's former coach Boris Becker wished new coach Agassi good luck The Las Vegan is only scheduled to stay in Paris until the end of this week before he has to leave for other prior engagements. ""I'm going to try to use the time spent with him as best as I can, as best as we can,"" said Djokovic. ""So far plenty of information, plenty of things to kind of process. ""I think this is exactly what I need at this moment, a person like him that understands the transitions as a tennis player and as a person as well, going through these kind of lifestyle and certain choices that you make, how that affects you later on."" Nadal, 30, was up against the crowd as much as his opponent as he took on Frenchman Paire on the lively Suzanne Lenglen Court. The fourth seed was himself given a huge ovation as his list of title wins stretching back to 2005 was read out, and he dominated for the most part. An unexpected rash of errors early in the second set allowed Paire into the match, and the world number 45 had a break point to lead 5-3, but Nadal snuffed out the danger and powered home. ""For me, it's important to serve a little bit better than I did today,"" said Nadal. ""The rest of the things I am happy with.""

"Rita, Sue and Bob Too depicted life on a Bradford estate in a darkly comic tale Billed as ""Thatcher's Britain with her knickers down"", British film comedy Rita, Sue and Bob Too was an unexpected hit when it was released 30 years ago. This darkly comic tale of two sexually confident working-class Bradford teenagers might have charmed the critics - but many closer to home failed to see the joke. Originally written for the stage in 1982 by Andrea Dunbar, the story depicted life on the deprived Buttershaw estate where she grew up - and did not flinch from its portrayal of alcoholism, violence, poverty and a feckless benefit culture. The film featured teenage babysitters Rita (Siobhan Finneran) and Sue (Michelle Holmes), who both partially escaped from their lives on the estate by having an affair with married man Bob (George Costigan) who lived in a detached house in a smarter part of the city. It was an incendiary mixture. The film was thought to reinforce negative stereotypes by some viewers Tony Earnshaw, author of Made in Yorkshire, a study of filmmaking in the county, was one of the many who reacted badly to the Alan Clarke-directed film when he first saw it as a teenager. The city was attempting to repair a poor public image - and the film was seen by many as reinforcing negative stereotypes. ""I didn't like it at the time, I wasn't mature enough to appreciate it,"" the author said. ""I am a working-class lad and I was angry about how it misrepresented Yorkshire. I thought its makers were laughing at us."" Such apparent sensitivity needs to be set against the backdrop of the time. The city of Bradford had taken a battering before the film was released Bradford's image had taken a battering in the 1980s: it had lost traditional industries and jobs, there were fierce arguments aboutrace and education, and the city suffered one of the worst British stadium tragedies when 56 football fans perished in the 1985Valley Parade fire. And then, of course, there was Bradford's most notorious son, Peter Sutcliffe,the Yorkshire Ripper, whose murderous campaign was finally halted by his chance arrest in 1981. The city had tried to lift collective spirits with Bradford's Bouncing Back, a feel-good marketing campaign launched in 1986, featuring a special poster by Bradford Grammar School alumnus David Hockney. Into this mix came the 1987 film,described by that doyen of film critics Roger Ebert,externalas ""a bleak, sardonic comedy about the violation of a taboo"". The play and film made Dunbar and the estate the focus of often unwelcome publicity Michelle Holmes (Sue) said the film was 'a snapshot of an age' Adelle Stripe, who has written a novel based on Dunbar's short life - the playwright died of a brain haemorrhage at the age of 29 in 1990 - said the film ""really poured oil on the fire"". ""She [Dunbar] wrote her first play when she was 15 years old, she'd never been to the theatre, and this is what is remarkable about her: she dramatised what was happening in her life at the time, and was encouraged by her teachers at Buttershaw Upper School."" Dunbar was asked by the BBC in 1987 whether the play was based on personal experiences. ""Parts of it was, parts wasn't - but you see things happening on an estate anyway,"" she said. ""But if you grow up on an estate, live there, you know everybody and I don't find it shocking to write about it."" Andrea Dunbar was interviewed by the BBC in 1987 about the film The play and film made Dunbar and the estate the focus of often unwelcome publicity, Ms Stripe says. ""She got a lot of negative press. Press cuttings of the time always mention she was an unmarried mother with three children. Not a big deal for us in 2017 but she took a lot of flak for it then. ""She liked having a drink... because you're working class and live on a council estate it therefore becomes a stick to beat her with. It was double standards, really."" David Wilson, who is the director of Bradford's City of Film programme, points out Bradford has undergone huge changes since the 1980s. ""Buttershaw is a different place now, some of the buildings and the low-rise flats on the estate have gone,"" he said. ""We have moved on and often changed beyond all recognition. ""But you can look back with a nostalgic view on the film, which was a social commentary that did not skirt some difficult issues."" The Buttershaw estate has been regenerated in recent years Mr Wilson believes Rita, Sue and Bob Too has many parallels with another film, the 1959 northern kitchen-sink dramaRoom at the Top,external. There were calls for that movie to be banned and it was given an X-rated certificate. Now it is widely praised as a classic British film, he said. He has recently rewatched Rita, Sue and Bob Too and was struck by the nostalgic fashions, furniture and architecture. Most importantly for him ""it inspired another generation of filmmakers and, creatively, it has not hindered Bradford at all"". This is a view that would most likely be shared by many Bradfordians, even those who were uneasy about the film on its release. Tony Earnshaw, certainly, says he feels very differently about Rita, Sue and Bob Too than he did as a teenager. ""I've come to realise it is a very accurate portrait of life,"" he said. ""There's a joie de vivre; the characters are not trying to escape from their lives, they are happy and don't aspire to anything more. ""It's a celebration of a certain strata of society. It occupies its own space in time."" Michelle Holmes, who played Sue, recalls the making of the film fondly. ""We had a brilliant, brilliant time, seven weeks of absolute fun,"" she said. ""It is crazy: who would have thought every single day somebody says something to me about the film? That's what I find incredible about it. ""Now it is a snapshot of an age and it seems to have more resonance.""
