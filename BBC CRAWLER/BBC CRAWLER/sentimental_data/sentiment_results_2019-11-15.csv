"The mother of a 10-year-old girl who died at a Glasgow children's hospital claims she was ""let down and lied to"" by health officials. Milly Main contracted an infection in 2017 while recovering from leukaemia at the Royal Hospital for Children. Her mother told the BBC she was ""100%"" certain contaminated water caused the fatal infection. Greater Glasgow health board insists the source of the infection cannot be determined. Kimberly Darroch gave details of her daughter's case after it washighlighted in the Scottish Parliament on Thursday,prompting calls for the resignation of Health Secretary Jeane Freeman. This video can not be played Kimberly Darroch believes she was let down over her daughter's death Ms Darroch said she emailed Ms Freeman in September ""asking for answers"" about her daughter's death but received only general assurances that it would be considered as part of an official inquiry. Ms Freeman said she instructed officials to get in contact with the family and did not make a public statement out of respect for patient confidentiality. Milly's mother described breaking down in tears when she read in theDaily Record newspaper,externalon Thursday that an unpublicised clinician-led review had identified 26 infection cases in 2017 possibly linked to contaminated water on the cancer ward -  including one that led to the death of a child. ""I feel let down but lied to. I don't know how to put it into words. There are no words to be honest I'm in shock, complete shock with it all,"" she said. Milly seriously ill in hospital after contracting an infection while recovering from leukaemia Milly, who had leukaemia, underwent a successful stem cell transplant in July 2017 and was making a good recovery when the following month her Hickman line, a catheter used to administer drugs, became infected. Milly went into toxic shock and died some days later. Her death certificate lists a Stenotrophomonas infection of the Hickman line among the possible causes of death but Ms Darroch says the family were kept in the dark about a potential link to contaminated water problems at the hospital. Milly's death certificate lists the Hickman line infection as a possible factor in her death She said shower heads were changed in the months before her daughter's death, and she is convinced the water supply was the source of the  infection. ""I think they knew prior to Milly's death that the water was contaminated. I feel they knew this was the infection that killed my daughter but no-one came forward to tell us."" Health secretary resignation call over child death Freeman did not make child infection death public She added: ""If they had told us at the time it would have been a hard pill to swallow but I would have swallowed it if they had just been honest."" Milly's mother said she emailed the health secretary in September asking for answers In September she emailed the health secretary asking for answers about her daughter's death. ""I emailed Jeane Freeman and got a reply 10 days later saying they would look into it and get back to me. ""They did get back to me a number of weeks later with a generic letter. It was addressed to myself and was slightly personal - but not very personal - saying they were holding an inquiry and they would pass it on to the health board's complaints manager. "" Asked what she wanted to happen next, she said: ""I think they should get the answers from the inquiry and release them. I want an apology. I want them to admit what they've done is wrong and I want them to admit that they've covered it up."" NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde said at the time there was no requirement to test the water supply for Stenotrophomonas. In a statement it said: ""We have offered to meet Mrs Darroch to discuss her concerns, and to answer her questions where we can. ""We fully understand that the family wants to know whether the infection Milly had is connected to the water supply. ""The truth is there is no way to know this as we did not consider this to be the source at the time and we did not test for the particular infection in the water supply."" Jeane Freeman said she wished to respect the family's right to confidentiality Health Secretary Jeane Freeman said the email from Milly's mother in September was the first time she was made aware of the child's death. She said: ""On 23 October I wrote to the parent expressing my condolences for their very sad loss and I would like to again take this opportunity to do so. ""I also advised them that I was ensuring that senior staff from NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde would make personal contact with them to address the questions I was sure they would have. ""Following my intervention I have checked and been assured that communication has been established, which will provide the necessary information for the family. ""I also made clear to the parent my intention that the public inquiry will be an opportunity for the voices of families to be heard and for answers to be provided. ""I am at all times aware of the importance of patient confidentiality and so, rightly I believe, I did not treat this correspondence as a public matter."" The problem of contaminated water is one of a number to beset the Queen Elizabeth University Hospital (QEUH) and the adjoining Royal Hospital for Children. Last year two cancer wards at the children's hospital were shut because of concerns about infection, and children were moved to the QEUH instead. An inquiry by Health Protection Scotland later identified 23 potentially water supply-linked infections during 2018. In January it emerged two patients at the QEUH had died after contracting an infection linked to pigeon droppings. Ms Freeman recently announced a public inquiry into construction issues at both the Glasgow ""super hospital"" site and the new children's hospital in Edinburgh. Scottish Labour MSP Anas Sarwar raised Milly's case at First Minister's Questions after a whistleblower revealed an unreported clinician-led review had identified 26 possible water supply-related infections in 2017 at the children's hospital. Mr Sarwar said: ""Milly's family deserve answers. It's the health secretary's job to protect patients and the staff, not the institution. ""They deserve answers and they deserve the the truth and those NHS staff who showed bravery in coming forward to be whistleblowers deserve to be protected."" Scottish Liberal Democrat health spokesman Alex Cole-Hamilton said Ms Freeman's decision not to go public was ""incomprehensible"" and called on her to make a statement at Holyrood on the issue. The Scottish Conservatives called on the health secretary to resign over the case. Tory health spokesman Miles Briggs said: ""Patients will be absolutely furious that such a serious failure has been covered up by this SNP government. ""The health secretary must apologise to the family and resign or, if she refuses, be sacked.""

" Election battleground: Aberdeen and Aberdeenshire  By Jon Kelly  Some days, when he takes his labrador, Buddy, for a walk, Brian Cooper strolls five minutes from his home to the banks of the River Dee and watches it flow towards Aberdeen.Brian grew up there in a two-bedroom tenement flat in Froghall, a council estate near the city centre. It was a close-knit place - his grandmother lived nearby, and an aunt and uncle too. Brian’s father was a bricklayer by trade, his mother variously a shop assistant, barmaid and carer. After leaving school at 16, Brian signed up for an apprenticeship with the Post Office.Then, at 21, Brian landed a job as an office boy with one of the energy companies that proliferated in the city after the discovery of North Sea oil - his father was among the men who went to work offshore. It meant a pay cut for Brian at first, but he knew it was an opportunity. He rose quickly through the ranks, eventually becoming a project manager before moving into business development and sales. Soon, Brian and his wife were able to buy an imposing detached house in the affluent suburb of Milltimber. Though it lies within the city boundaries, it feels like a village. In the summer, families have picnics by the banks of the river.Brian, 37, isn’t the sort to put posters in the window of his home at election time. ""I wouldn’t say I was a political animal,” he says. He’s well aware he doesn’t have all the answers. “I’m probably more of a distant spectator trying to form my own view.”And so in 2014, as the referendum on Scottish independence approached, Brian carefully studied the arguments for and against. “I felt there were positives as an independent country,” he says. With its natural resources and human capital, he was confident Scotland could succeed on its own. “Scottish people are pretty resilient, we are pretty welcoming, we welcome others into the country - I always felt we would build something.” That September, the morning after the No campaign’s victory was declared, Brian was disappointed. But he quickly picked himself up, accepting that a decision had been made, although he still believed that, in the long term, Scotland should be a nation state in its own right.Then, nearly two years later, there was another referendum to consider - this time on the UK’s membership of the European Union. He hadn’t thought much about the issue before, but it seemed the original aims of the European project - to bring peace and stability to the continent - had been met. The crisis in the Eurozone made him wonder what the point of it was in the current era.“You start thinking, ‘So it started out as something, but is it still serving that purpose to this day? The world we live in now, is that where we were when this bloc was formed?’ I think we live in a completely different time.”On the morning of 24 June 2016, he woke to find that while Scotland had voted heavily to Remain, his side - Leave - had narrowly won across the UK as whole. He assumed the politicians at Westminster would do as they had been instructed and make Brexit happen. But as the years went on and they failed to do so, he grew increasingly frustrated.“For me, I just think everyone now wants it done,” he says. He’d rather Brexit was completed before another independence referendum. “You need to take care of Brexit first, understand where it’s going to lead to.” Brian’s support for both Scottish independence and Brexit isn’t shared by any of the major political parties. But he’s far from alone in his position. In 2017 the British Election Study estimated that Yes-Leave voters made up 17% of the Scottish electorate. This part of Scotland voted mostly for Remain. In Aberdeen city, as in Scotland as a whole, more than 60% voted to stay in the EU. But in the surrounding local authority area – Aberdeenshire – the vote was closer: 55% voted Remain, with fishing communities along the north-east coast showing particularly strong support for Brexit. In the wake of both referendums, the region has become highly volatile. Aberdeen South, the constituency in which Brian lives, has been represented over the past decade by MPs from Labour, the Scottish National Party and the Conservatives. Neighbouring West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine, through which the Dee flows from its source towards the outskirts of the city, has been represented at Westminster over the same period by a Liberal Democrat MP, then one from the SNP, then a Tory.   The river - alongside the Don, one of two that passes through Aberdeen - descends from the expanse of the Cairngorms National Park, through the area around Balmoral known as Royal Deeside, past commuter towns like Banchory towards Aberdeen’s docks - a varied string of communities. As well as being an area of extraordinary natural beauty, it’s now among Scotland’s most fiercely contested political terrain. Like Brian, Brid Ni Mhaoileoin lives five minutes' walk away from the Dee. But her view from Torry, a former fishing village long since subsumed by Aberdeen at the very mouth of the river’s south bank, is radically different. It overlooks Aberdeen Harbour, north-east Scotland’s key commercial port and the North Sea energy industry’s main support centre.Its tidal waters are thick with commercial traffic, but Brid, 59, says there’s more to it besides. “You can see otters, herons, the wildlife round there is amazing,” she says. “You see all the boat clubs, and the guys out rowing at 6am. I love living this close to the river. I suppose it’s a lifeline.”Brid grew up in Westport, Co Mayo. In 1984, with unemployment running high in the Republic of Ireland, Brid came to Aberdeen to visit her sister and never went back. Early on, she was struck by the sense of community and how quickly she got to know all her neighbours. She now works at Aberdeen Royal Infirmary as a medical technician, and considers Aberdeen her home. Aberdeen is one of Scotland’s most prosperous places - a report by Demos and PwC ranked it the best city in Scotland to live and work in. But Torry hasn’t seen much of its wealth. It is ranked by the local authority as its most deprived community. “You can see the effects of poverty and austerity and lack of funding here,” Brid says. In recent years demand has skyrocketed at the local food banks. There’s also a recognition that, as the climate crisis intensifies, the reliance on oil and gas won’t last forever. “Aberdeen has always been a wealthy city, but it has always had its share of poverty,” says Brid. “If you don’t have a lot of money it’s a very expensive place to live.”Brid had always taken an interest in politics, but the independence referendum transformed everything. As in many working-class areas of Scotland that had traditionally supported the Labour party, groups supporting the Yes campaign flourished in Torry. For supporters of independence, galvanised by the promise of remaking the nation, this explosion of enthusiasm was thrilling and liberating.But Brid wasn’t one of them. She was sceptical about the prospectus set out by the Scottish government. “Of course Scotland would survive independence,” she says. “But honestly, a complete break and making yourself into a small community is not the way Scotland should go at the moment. In the same way as I voted no to Brexit, I think we need to stick together. It sounds really cliched, but united we stand, divided we fall.” There was mutual incomprehension among those on either side of the divide. “I lost some friends over it,” Brid admits. “At my work I didn’t speak about it because I felt uncomfortable about the reaction I was getting.” She joined the Labour Party, and although she eventually ended up on the winning side in the 2014 referendum, the SNP’s landslide at the 2015 general election ensured it didn’t really feel like a victory for long. But the biggest trauma was the vote to leave the EU. Her friends in Torry’s sizeable Eastern European community tell her of their fears that they’ll be sent home. She worries, too, that a trade deal with the US will open the NHS to privatisation. This hasn’t led her to re-evaluate her position on Scotland’s status within the UK: “There’s no guarantee we’ll get into the EU if we have independence.” Brid doesn’t have much enthusiasm for a general election in December, when the Aberdeen skies turn dark by mid-afternoon. “It’s going to be absolutely cold, wet and miserable, and I think people will feel cold, wet and miserable,” she says. “They won’t want to stand at their front door at 8pm when it’s pouring with rain and you’re asking them, 'Who are you going to vote for?'” The past few years have been equally gloomy for the brand of politics she supports. “But all we can do is keep fighting for that,” she says. “And hopefully things will come back to normal.” Bishop Auckland Southampton The rain has just stopped falling as Chris Redmond unstraps the kayak from the roof of his car and carries it down to the riverbank. The morning’s downpour was a welcome arrival, swelling as it did the level of the Dee. “It’s really mellow and relaxed out there today,” he says. “Anything lower than this would be a bit scrapey.”Chris, 35, first came to Deeside to visit relatives of his wife 11 years ago, while training to be a teacher. “On the drive home, there were lovely autumnal colours - it was this time of year - and I said I could see us living here some day.” Nine months later he was offered a job at the primary school in Aboyne, a village 30 miles west of Aberdeen. Today Chris is chairman of the village’s canoe club, and he’s paddled the river from Linn of Dee to its tidal limit on the outskirts of Aberdeen. “The river is one of the most varied in Scotland. It’s just got fantastic scenery, a whole range of different rapids, and lots of great communities along the way as well. It starts off with all the small villages and it gets bigger as it goes along.”It’s an idyllic location, but keeping his head above water isn’t just something Chris has to worry about when he’s on the river. Aberdeenshire is an expensive place to live - when he first moved to Aboyne, there were only two properties in the area he could afford to rent on a teacher's salary. Buying was an even bigger challenge, and though he managed it eventually he can see it's getting ever harder for key workers to put down roots. He fears the consequences. “Teacher shortages have a knock-on effect for children’s education. And that has a knock-on effect further down the line. And so on and so on.”Chris says his is a typical “just about managing” family. He now works full time as a nursery manager, his wife is part-time, and, with two children to raise, “all it takes is one big cost, a big unexpected something, to put pressure on the finances”.As well as the cost of living, he worries about how much there is in the area for young people - they are already a smaller proportion of the population here than in most other areas of the UK. And if they want to head into Aberdeen by bus, the cost and timetabling is often prohibitive. Chris’s canoe club at least helps bring people of different age groups together. A few years ago he applied for European funding to build a storage facility for paddle sports enthusiasts - a green edifice on the banks of the river known affectionately as the Canoe Cathedral. “Without that, who knows where the club might have been?”In 2014, Chris voted Yes to independence, although he remembers it as a closely balanced decision. “It was very much 50-50,” he recalls. “It was up for debate.” But the referendum on the EU was a different matter. He knew that Aberdeenshire's tourism industry was dependent on migrant workers to keep all the hotels, cafes and visitor attractions fully staffed.So in the wake of the Leave vote, the arguments for Scottish statehood began to look even more convincing to Chris.“I support a second referendum on independence,” he says. “With where we are, leaving the EU, I support Scotland rejoining the EU. Scotland is a nation that welcomes people from all different nations, we recognise the value both culturally in having a range of opinions, views, and also in terms of the economy. People who’ve moved in from Eastern European states take those jobs that [other] people don’t want to take, that we don’t have enough people for.” Each morning, around 6:30-ish, Simon Blackett wakes up, gets dressed and pulls on his yellow wellington boots. Then he goes for an early morning half-hour walk   around Braemar with his two chocolate-brown cocker spaniels.This part of Aberdeenshire, shaped by the upper reaches of the River Dee, has been popular with visitors ever since Queen Victoria and Prince Albert made nearby Balmoral Castle their holiday home. Members of the royal family still attend Braemar's Highland Gathering. The allure of the place isn’t just historic - Fife Arms, a newly refurbished former coaching house in the village, with a Picasso in the drawing room, was recently named Hotel of the Year by the Sunday Times. Simon, 65, knows every inch of the village. He runs his own tour company, is an elder of nearby Craithie Kirk, is chairman of the company that runs Braemar Castle on behalf of the community and, for good measure, is a stalwart of the local history group. A Sandhurst-trained ex-Army officer, for 21 years Simon was the local Invercauld country estate’s resident factor - a traditional Scots word for someone who manages land on behalf of its owner. Some estates have adopted modern terms like “general manager”, but Simon prefers the old-fashioned title, even if “it did get a bit of a bad press with the Clearances” - factors having carried out mass evictions across the north of Scotland in the century or so after 1750.That sort of ruthlessness wasn’t Simon’s style, but being in charge of a sporting estate like Invercauld was a huge undertaking. It stretches across 108,000 acres and comprises, among other things, a ski centre, a caravan park, forestry and holiday cottages. Simon had ultimate responsibility for running the lot. “It was 24/7,” he recalls. “You are taking on a lifestyle rather than a nine-to-five job. People would ask you questions at any time. I was lucky enough to have a family who enjoyed it. It was a brilliant job and I picked up an awful lot of knowledge.”Simon’s time in charge of Invercauld was an era of great upheaval for rural Scotland. It saw the introduction of right-to-roam legislation by the Scottish Parliament and the creation of the Cairngorms National Park, with Braemar its centre.The river was changing, too. It had long been a hugely popular spot for fishing. Historically, visitors paid for their holidays by selling the fish they caught. But when it became clear fish stocks were dwindling, in part because the water was heating up, a catch-and-release system with barbless hooks was introduced.Although coachloads of visitors pour into Braemar throughout the summer, Simon says there's sometimes a sense in rural Scotland of being ignored. “There’s a feeling in our part of the world that Scotland tends to be central belt-dominated, because that’s where most people live and that’s where the votes are and where most of the politicians are,” he says.Living in Braemar, with its reliance on tourism, Simon didn’t see Brexit coming. “You didn’t meet many people who gave good reasons to get out,” he says. Then, shortly before the EU referendum, he drove to a 90th birthday party in Hereford. “We kept going through these English cities and there were banners everywhere and I said to my daughter: ‘This is real. This is scary stuff. These people mean it.’”But unlike Chris, he doesn't want to see another referendum on independence. “I’m quite happy to admit I’m a unionist and we have to think incredibly seriously, particularly now we’ve had the experience of Brexit, do we really want to inflict this on the country at this particular moment?”Simon doesn't feel Scotland's referendum divides have scarred the country irreparably - political differences haven't driven a wedge between him and his wife, an SNP councillor. But the path ahead leaves him uncertain.“I have a vote in this coming election, but I don’t know how I’m going to use it, because it’s really confusing,"" he says. ""And whatever traditional party you might have voted for in the past, they seem to be standing for something different now, and there’s a lot of subliminal messages saying, 'If you want to leave you vote Tory, and if you want to remain you vote Labour,' which is an odd way of looking at it. It’s unhelpful - it’s really, really unhelpful - to the electorate. But we’re all going to have to make a decision.”And so will the rest of Deeside. Meanwhile the river flows on, from Braemar down through Aboyne, through Aberdeen past Torry and out into the world.

"Taylor Swift is in a dispute with Scooter Braun (centre) and Scott Borchetta Taylor Swift's former record label has rebuffed her claims it is blocking her from performing her own hits at the forthcoming American Music Awards. The singer said music executives Scooter Braun and Scott Borchetta would not let her perform songs from her past albums, which they own the rights to. She said a Netflix documentary about her life had also been put in jeopardy. Borchetta and Braun's Big Machine Records said Swift's statement was ""based on false information"".

""Right now my performance at the AMAs, the Netflix documentary and any other recorded events I am planning to play until November 2020 are a question mark,"" she wrote. But in response, the label denied telling the pop superstar she could not perform at the AMAs or trying to block the Netflix special, and said the ""narrative you have created does not exist"". Swift is being named Artist of the Decade at this month's AMAs In June, Swift revealed thatthe masters of her early music had been sold to Braun by her former record label, run by Borchetta, and alleged that she was not told about it. At the time the singer accused Braun, who also manages Ariana Grande, Justin Bieber and Demi Lovato, of ""incessant, manipulative bullying"". Swift also accused Braun of attempting to ""dismantle"" her ""musical legacy"".,externalWhile he did not respond to her comments, he was supported by Lovato and Bieber, who claimed Swift was just out ""to get sympathy"". The singer confirmed in August that she planned to re-record music from her first six albums so she could own the rights to the new versions. Swift is set to be named Artist of the Decade at the AMAs later this month and said she had been planning to perform a medley of her hits. But in her statement on Thursday, she said the two men had blocked her from performing her old songs on television, claiming that this would be re-recording her music before she is allowed to next year. They also blocked the use of her older music or performance footage in the upcoming Netflix film, she claimed. Swift alleged that Borchetta told her team she would only be allowed to use the music if she agreed ""not to re-record copycat versions"" next year and stopped talking about the two men. ""The message being sent to me is very clear. Basically, be a good little girl and shut up. Or you'll be punished,"" she wrote. She went on to ask her fans to help to pressure Braun and Borchetta into changing their minds and to appeal to the artists they manage for help. She also asked for help from the private equity firm The Carlyle Group, which she said financed the sale. Fans responded instantly, with the hashtags ""IStandWithTaylor"" and ""FreeTaylor"" trending on Twitter. Ina statement,external, the Big Machine Label Group said it had been optimistic about resolving the long-running dispute - until Swift posted her statement on Thursday. ""Despite our persistent efforts to find a private and mutually satisfactory solution, Taylor made a unilateral decision last night to enlist her fanbase in a calculated manner that greatly affects the safety of our employees and their families,"" the label said. In June, Scooter Braun (right) bought Big Machine, which Borchetta founded in 2005 ""Taylor, the narrative you have created does not exist. All we ask is to have a direct and honest conversation. When that happens, you will see there is nothing but respect, kindness and support waiting for you on the other side."" Big Machine also said: ""At no point did we say Taylor could not perform on the AMAs or block her Netflix special. In fact, we do not have the right to keep her from performing live anywhere."" It did not specifically address whether she could perform old songs. In response,the singer's publicist Tree Paine insisted,externalthat Borchetta ""flatly denied the request for both American Music Awards and Netflix"". Both sides also claim the other owes them millions of dollars. Borchetta founded Big Machine in 2005, and the company was bought by Braun's Ithaca Holdings in June. Stars including Halsey, Gigi Hadid and BBC Radio 1 DJ Greg James have leapt to the singer's defence. Fellow pop singer Halsey said: ""These people are protected because they inspire complicity with fear. ""Banking on the illusion that people will not stand up for her. That the world will say she is over-reacting, You're barking up the wrong tree. ""It is her grace and patience in these moments that make her artist of the decade,"" she added.

After Braun bought most of the US pop star's life's work, thanks to his acquisition of her former record label Big Machine for $300m (Â£237m) in June, Tim Ingham from Music Business Worldwidetold the BBCin July that these kind of contract arrangements were fairly common in the days before music streaming. ""Unfortunately for Taylor Swift, she started recording at a time in the history of the industry when it was still heavily reliant on radio, where you needed a record company backing to get you on radio, particularly country radio in Nashville, where Big Machine was a huge player,"" said Ingham. ""And also, you needed to rely on physical distribution to get your CDs into stores. So she needed a record company to invest the amount of money that they had to invest to get her career off the ground."" Mark Sutherland, editor of trade publication Music Week, agreed in July with Ingham that Braun's business decisions will most likely be driven by money. ""A lot of those songs are going to be a small goldmine in the streaming environment as they are enduring pop hits that are going to be streamed from now until the next 20, 30, 40 years.""

"The Strictly Come Dancing judges in charitable mood Stars from Strictly, Star Wars, Doctor Who and EastEnders are lending a hand to Children In Need to help raise funds in this year's charity BBC TV appeal.

"The Lib Dems are set to field 188 female candidates Record numbers of women look set to stand for Parliament next month, making up about a third of the candidates. BBC analysis of Press Association figures found 1,124 of 3,322 registered candidates were women. This figure is slightly higher than the 1,120 reported based on PA figures on Friday. The Conservatives and Labour are set to field candidates in every constituency in Britain, except Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle's seat in Chorley in Lancashire. The Brexit Party has put forward 275 candidates, having stood aside in the 317 seats won by the Tories in 2017 in an effort to avoid splitting the pro-Brexit vote. The party has also opted not to contest handfuls of other seats being defended by other parties, particularly in Scotland. LIVE :Latest election updates CONFUSED?:Our simple election guide,external POLICY GUIDE:Who should I vote for?,external POLLS:How are the parties doing?,external A TO Z:Our tool to explain election words,external REGISTER:What you need to do to vote The party, which topped the polls in May's European elections, is only standing in 15 of the 46 non-Tory constituencies in Scotland. They are not contesting Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson's East Dunbartonshire seat. The BBC's analysis of candidate lists in each of the UK's 650 constituencies shows that there will be a healthy increase in the number of women standing. This year there are 1,124 female candidates, up from 2015's record of 1,033. In 2017, just 973 female candidates took part in that year's snap election, according to research by the House of Commons library. More than half of Labour's candidates are women - 335 of 631, while 192 - or 30% - of the Conservatives' 635 candidates are female. The Greens and Lib Dems are fielding 205 and 188 female candidates respectively. There have been concerns that levels of abuse on social media might deter women from standing, with a number of high-profile former female ministers citing this as their main reason for quitting frontline politics. The MPs who have thrown in the towel And those who never made it to the starting line The Lib Dems and Plaid Cymru are fielding fewer candidates than in 2017, the parties having agreed to stand down in some seats in order to maximise the pro-Remain vote, However, UKIP is set to see the biggest drop in representation. It is standing 44 candidates, down from 467 two years ago. Total candidates by party (women in brackets) Conservative and Unionist Party - 635 (192) Labour - 631 (335).

"The Duchess of Sussex has accused the Mail on Sunday and its parent company of a campaign of ""untrue"" stories, according to new details of her legal action against the newspaper group. Court papers filed against the group set out a list of ""false"" articles about Meghan,the website Byline says.,external Her lawyers claim the Mail on Sunday removed passages of a private letter to her father to portray her ""negatively"". The Mail on Sunday repeated its intent to defend the case ""with vigour"". ""There is nothing in this document which changes that position,"" a spokesman said. Meghan sues Mail on Sunday over private letter Harry sues Sun and Mirror's owners in phone-hacking claim Sussexes and Cambridges reunite at Remembrance event In October, law firm Schillings, acting for the duchess, filed a High Court claim against the Mail on Sunday and its parent company over the alleged misuse of private information, infringement of copyright and breach of the Data Protection Act 2018. The claim came after the Mail on Sunday published a handwritten letter from Meghan to her father, Thomas Markle, sent shortly after she and Prince Harry got married in 2018. It is claimed the newspaper did not publish parts of the letter because it would undermine its ""negative"" portrayal of the duchess. The court papers claim that Meghan's father was exploited by journalists and say that reporters also invented a series of claims about her relationship with her mother. The duchess' lawyers will also accuse Associated Newspapers, the parent entity of the Mail newspapers, of printing ""completely untrue"" stories about renovations to Meghan and Prince Harry's home. They say that claims by the paper - also published on the Mail Online website - that a Â£5,000 copper bath and Â£500,000-worth of soundproofing were charged to the taxpayer were lies. In a statement last month,external, the Duke of Sussex said he and Meghan were forced to take action against ""relentless propaganda"" and a ""ruthless campaign that has escalated over the past year"".

"The letter was sent to Anna Soubry at her constituency office in Nottingham A man who threatened Change UK leader Anna Soubry, referencing the murdered MP Jo Cox, has been jailed for a year. Alden Bryce Barlow, 55, of Milton Walk, Doncaster, South Yorkshire, sent a letter to Ms Soubry in her constituency in Nottingham. The message read: ""Cox was first, you are next"" and referred to Ms Soubry as ""treacherous"" and ""worthless"". He was jailed at Sheffield Crown Court and given a 10-year order preventing him from contacting Ms Soubry. He was also ordered not to go near Ms Soubry's constituency address in Nottingham. More stories from around Yorkshire The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) said the letter was addressed to her constituency office, and was opened by her constituency manager who called police. Jo Cox was murdered in 2016 in Birstall, West Yorkshire Barlow was traced by his fingerprints on the letter and from CCTV at the post office counter in the Doncaster branch of WH Smith, where he posted it. He was then charged with sending a letter conveying a threatening message, which he admitted. Chief Crown Prosecutor Gerry Wareham said: ""This letter contained a sickening and ominous threat to Ms Soubry, with an explicit reference to the murder of Jo Cox MP in 2016. ""Ms Soubry and her staff in the constituency office understandably found the message deeply disturbing and highly offensive. ""What is more, attacks such as this on our elected representatives are attacks on democracy and perpetrators will be prosecuted.""

"This video can not be played Teresa Cheng is jostled in London China has condemned what it called an ""appalling attack"" by protesters on Hong Kong's justice secretary in London on Thursday evening. Teresa Cheng fell and was treated for an arm injury in hospital after being jostled by about 30 supporters of Hong Kong's pro-democracy movement. Chinese official Geng Shuang said some in the UK ""supported violent acts... to create chaos"" in its former colony. Hong Kong has been racked by five months of anti-government protests. The campaign started in opposition to a now-withdrawn plan to allow extradition to mainland China, but it has since morphed into wider demonstrations backing democracy and opposing the actions of the police. Hong Kong in first recession for a decade Hong Kong protests explained in 100 and 500 words The protests have continued unabated - Friday was the fifth consecutive day - and have often turned violent. On Thursday, a 70-year-old man died after being hit by a brick thrown during clashes. A murder inquiry has been opened. Hong Kong meanwhile confirmed it had entered its first recession for a decade, with the economy shrinking 3.2% in July to September, compared with the previous quarter. The justice secretary had been in Camden, north London, to promote Hong Kong as a dispute resolution and deal-making hub. Ms Cheng fell to the ground during the incident in Camden Video showed her walking towards a lecture at the Chartered Institute of Arbitrators (CIArb) when she was surrounded by a group of protesters. Some held signs and shouted ""murderer"" and in the melee, Ms Cheng fell to the ground. London's Metropolitan Police said they were investigating an allegation of assault and no arrests had yet been made. ""A woman was taken to hospital by London Ambulance Service suffering an injury to her arm,"" a statement said. In a statement, CIArb said Ms Cheng had been ""assaulted by a crowd"". But one of the protesters told the Guardian she had slipped trying to escape from the crowd and ""nobody laid a hand on her"". Tom Tugendhat, chair of parliament's foreign affairs committee, condemned the behaviour of the protesters. Ministers ""visiting the UK should be able to go about their business free from abuse and assault. This is not right"", he tweeted. Mr Geng, China's foreign ministry spokesman, said the attack was ""directly related to certain British politicians confusing right from wrong on the Hong Kong issue and their support for violent acts, giving a platform to those who are anti-China and want to create chaos in Hong Kong"". Hong Kong pushed to 'brink of total collapse' Hong Kong to close schools amid tense protests He said if the UK did not alter its approach ""and continues to add fuel to the fire, sow discord and instigate others"" it would ""bring calamity on itself"". He urged the UK to ""bring the culprits to justice and... also protect the safety and integrity of all Chinese people in the nation"". Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam also condemned the protesters in the UK,external, saying ""the savage act breached the bottom line of any civilised society"". Ms Cheng's office said she ""castigates the violent mob in London causing her serious bodily harm on her way to an event venue"". Protesters say Ms Cheng played a key role in pushing for the extradition bill. Protesters, including thousands of office workers, were on the streets again on Friday, many of them chanting ""stand with Hong Kong"". A number of roads were blocked and there was more disruption on the underground rail system. Black-clad protesters also continued to occupy university campuses. Roadblocks and other travel disruption continue unabated in Hong Kong It comes a day after Chinese President Xi Jinping warned the protests were threatening the ""one country, two systems"" policy under which Hong Kong retains a high level of autonomy and personal freedom unseen in mainland China. Police in Hong Kong are treating as murder the death of the 70-year-old hit by a brick during unrest in the border town of Sheung Shui on Wednesday. The government said the cleaner was on a lunch break when he was struck by ""hard objects hurled by masked rioters"". This video can not be played How Hong Kong got trapped in a cycle of violence Video purported to be of the incident shows two groups throwing bricks at each other before the man falls to the ground. On Monday, a police officer shot an activist in the torso with a live bullet, and a man was set on fire while arguing with anti-government protesters. A week ago, Alex Chow, a 22-year-old student, died after falling from a building during a police operation.

"The child was born at the Royal Glamorgan Hospital in Llantrisant, Rhondda Cynon Taff A ""remarkable"" child starved of oxygen and born severely disabled has been awarded Â£18m compensation. The mother suffered a ruptured uterus during the birth and the family's lawyers claimed her eventual caesarean delivery was negligently delayed. The child needs 24-hour care for life, London's High Court heard. Cwm Taf health board admitted liability for injuries sustained in the 2012 birth at Royal Glamorgan Hospital, Llantrisant. The seven-year-old child, who cannot be named, has spastic diplegic cerebral palsy which affects muscles in their legs, developmental delay, learning disabilities, behavioural and sensory issues. A total settlement of Â£17.9m was agreed, which includes a Â£7.75m lump sum, and Â£92,000 annual payments, rising to Â£155,000 in 2031, to cover their care for life. Royal Glamorgan maternity staff shortages 'significant' Cwm Taf maternity services: 'Long way to go' until safe The child's mother called it a ""long seven year battle"" saying the hospital initially conducted a review and gave them ""a scrap piece of paper concluding that no lessons needed to be learned"". ""We simply could not believe that its senior medical staff, tasked with reviewing incidents involving serious, lifelong and preventable injuries, failed to identify error, after error, after error,"" she said. ""When you have a child with cerebral palsy, the entire family is significantly impacted. The plans and lifestyle we had, and should have had, have simply gone. ""We cannot do the things that other families take for granted with ease like going on bike rides or going to the beach. Every day is a challenge."" She said her child would never be able to work and may never be able to live independently. The hearing took place at London's High Court Birth injuries specialist lawyer Diane Rostron called it a ""very serious, and entirely preventable, brain injury"". She said failings started when the mother had her first child, with medical staff making a ""critical error"" in recording the wrong type of caesarean section incision. ""Had this essential piece of information been accurately recorded, the hospital should have known that there was a high risk of a uterine rupture in a second pregnancy prompting an early medical intervention in the lead up to our client's birth,"" she said. When the mother was admitted to hospital with ""significant abdominal pain"", Ms Rostron said this should have prompted an ""urgent review"". Instead, an impending uterus rupture was not diagnosed and instead she was left in ""excruciating pain"" for a few hours. The baby's heart rate was slowing and Ms Rostron added: ""The hospital continued to fail in its duties and more than seven hours after being admitted with red flag symptoms, the plan remained to simply observe mother and baby."" An emergency c-section was finally carried out eight hours after admission, with the baby suffering ""27 minutes of significantly slowed heart rate before their birth"". She said it was ""very concerning"" the health board initially failed to recognise the emergency and failed to uphold a complaint from the family. The family said there was ""error after error"" at the Royal Glamorgan Hospital Representing the family at the High Court, William Featherby said the child had almost no sense of danger. He said the child was at ""high risk"" when crossing the road and was slow to react to pain, once suffering serious burns when they touched a hot metal plate. The child could ride a tricycle if their feet were strapped to the pedals, but needed a buggy or electric wheelchair over distances of more than 100 yards, he added. For the health board, Richard Booth acknowledged ""no amount of money"" could ever fully compensate the child for their birth injuries. But he added: ""On behalf of the board I would like to apologise wholeheartedly and unreservedly for the regrettable failings in care in this case. ""I would also like to pay tribute to the parents for the outstanding care that they have given [their child]."" He added the child was ""remarkable"". Approving the settlement, Judge Sarah Richardson said she was ""more than satisfied"" it was in the child's best interests.

"This video can not be played Sir Ed said Labour and the Tories are ""competing to bankrupt Britain"". A Liberal Democrat government would spend Â£100bn tackling the effects of climate change and protecting the environment, the party's deputy leader has announced. Sir Ed Davey said the five-year investment would ""jump-start"" efforts to combat the ""climate emergency"". The pledge would be funded through borrowing and tax changes, to be set out in detail in the party's manifesto. The Conservatives and Labour both have targets to reduce carbon emissions. Sir Ed, who served as secretary of state for energy and climate change in the coalition government, said his party would ""decarbonise capitalism"" if elected. Live: Election campaign latest What is a climate emergency? He said a Lib Dem administration would be a ""government of business"" by stopping Brexit, increasing investment in infrastructure, and promoting new green jobs. Speaking in Leeds, he also pledged his party would build a new tram or metro system in the West Yorkshire city. Sir Ed, who is also the party's finance spokesman, said the climate investment would include a new Â£10bn ""renewable power fund"" to leverage more than Â£100bn of extra private climate investment. Environmental campaigners recently floated a replica of a British home in the River Thames to highlight rising sea levels ""This will fast track deployment of clean energy, to make Britain not just the world leader in offshore wind, but also the global number one in tidal power too. ""And we will invest Â£15bn more to make every building in the country greener, with an emergency ten-year programme to save energy, end fuel poverty and cut heating bills."" Climate change 'accelerating', say scientists 'Only big changes' will tackle climate change Who should I vote for? General election 2019 policy guide Green Party pledges to appoint 'carbon chancellor' The party said the policy would be funded through Â£85bn of borrowing and Â£15bn raised through tax changes, which will be detailed in its manifesto. Sir Ed also attacked the ""fantasy economics"" of Prime Minister Boris Johnson and Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, claiming that the spending plans unveiled by the two parties represent a ""debate between fantasies"". ""Fantasies born of nostalgia for a British Imperial past. Competing with fantasies from a failed 1970s ideology."" He said his party would not do any kind of deal with Mr Johnson or Mr Corbyn if no party wins a majority on 12 December. But he said they would vote ""issue by issue"" with a minority Conservative or Labour government, in an effort to make them more ""moderate"". ""What we will not do is have a coalition or have a supply and confidence relationship, because we think these parties have become too extreme,"" he said. This video can not be played Could your vote save the planet? This Matters looks into what's really going on in this election He also repeated his claim that stopping Brexit would deliver a Â£50bn ""Remain bonus"" for public services, due to better economic growth. BBC Reality Check correspondent Chris Morris said the vast majority of forecasts do expect the economy would be bigger if the UK were to stay in the EU. But he added the size of that ""bonus"" cannot be predicted with any certainty, and Â£50bn was not a hugely significant amount in terms of overall government expenditure. The Lib Dem climate pledge follows the Green Party's promiseto appoint a ""carbon chancellor""to allocate Â£100bn per year towards climate change. Labour has announced it would make all new-build homes""zero carbon"" by 2022, as well asreducing the UK's carbon emissions by 10%through a huge home improvement programme. The Conservativeshave announced a halt to fracking, the controversial process of extracting gas from shale rock, and, in government, the partyset a target of ""net-zero""carbon emissions by 2050.

"Firefighters are tackling the blaze at The Cube in Bolton Firefighters have been tackling a huge blaze at a university student accommodation block. Crowds of students were evacuated from The Cube in Bolton when the fire broke out at about 20:30 GMT on Friday. At its height about 200 firefighters from 40 fire engines were tackling the blaze which was affecting every floor. A witness said the fire was ""climbing up"" the six-storey building. One person was rescued by crews using an aerial platform. Greater Manchester Fire and Rescue Service (GMFRS) said two people were treated by paramedics at the scene. It said six fire engines remained at the scene at 05:30 as firefighters ""tackle the last few pockets of fire"". Area manager Jim Hutton said ""hardworking firefighters"" had prevented the fire from spreading to an adjacent building. ""Our crews have done a fantastic job bringing this fire under control, in what have been very challenging circumstances,"" added Assistant Chief Fire Officer Tony Hunter. One witness said the fire was ""climbing up"" the building University of Bolton student Shannon Parker, who lives in the building, said she was in her room when the fire started. ""I heard the fire alarm going off but it kept on going off so I just thought it was a drill at first until one of my flatmates shouted down the corridor that it was a real fire,"" the 22-year-old said. ""So I ran out the flat as quickly as I could and I saw that it was one of the flats below mine and we went out by the fire exit."" She said she was being relocated to either a nearby hotel or another student accommodation building. Police have closed a number of roads in the area GMFRS has asked residents of The Cube to register at Orlando Village Student Accommodation and contact family members to let them know they are safe. The University of Bolton said it was supporting students who had been evacuated and had given people temporary accommodation at the Orlando student halls and in some hotels. Prof George E Holmes DL, president and vice-chancellor of the university, said: ""University colleagues have worked through the night to make sure support is in place for students over the weekend. ""We have also arranged to provide necessities such as toiletries for all students affected and are opening the university over the weekend so students can be supported. We will also provide food for them."" He said The Cube was not owned by the University of Bolton and that it was owned and managed by a private landlord. Allow Twitter content?

"The couple face four child cruelty charges relating to the four-week-old and another of the couple's children The parents of a four-week-old baby who suffered a fractured skull, brain injuries and broken ribs have been charged with child cruelty offences. Amanda Fulton, 31, and her husband Christopher Fulton, 30, are charged over alleged offences on 7 November. The court heard the baby is thought to have long-term brain injuries and be blind in both eyes. The couple, from Rockfield Gardens, Mosside, County Antrim, face the same four charges. They are accused of grievous bodily harm with intent, two counts of child cruelty involving two different children and causing or allowing a child to suffer serious physical harm. The couple appeared at Coleraine Magistrates' Court on Monday to face the charges but a press ban prevented proceedings from being reported. The ban was lifted at the court on Friday by a district judge. A police officer told the court the baby was taken to a GP on 7 November before being rushed to hospital in an ambulance. The infant was found to have a fractured skull, a bleed on the brain, a laceration to its liver and broken ribs. The court heard the baby had now been taken off life support and was able to breathe for itself, but was thought to have long-term brain injuries. On further investigation, another of the couple's children was found to have discolouration on the back of their skull and ear. The case was heard at Coleraine Magistrate's Court A police officer told the court the couple could not explain the injuries to their children, but accepted they had not been in the care of anyone else. The officer said a medical expert believed the injuries to the baby were ""non-accidental"" and had not been caused during birth. The officer said the fact some of the infant's rib fractures were healing led the medical expert to believe this was ""not one isolated incident"". The police officer also told the court that a death threat, believed to be from a loyalist paramilitary group, has been issued against the couple threatening them if they leave prison. The officer said there were ""high tensions"" in the Mosside area because of the case. A defence barrister said the Fultons were ""living every parent's worst nightmare"". He told the court threats had been made against the couple in Hydebank and Maghaberry prisons, where they are currently on remand. The barrister also showed the court threats that had been made on social media against his clients. On Monday, in court, the barrister said his clients had been ""vilified"" due to press coverage of the case and added they were entitled to the presumption of innocence. He told the court the alleged baby victim had been born prematurely and weighed five pounds at birth. Police objected to a bail application on the grounds of the risk of further offending, interference with witnesses and tensions in the Mosside area. Bail was refused and the couple were remanded in custody.

"This video can not be played Boris Johnson on Russian donations and alleged interference in UK politics. Boris Johnson has been quizzed on Russia, flooding and his children by members of the public during a BBC Radio 5 Live and News Channel phone-in. During the programme, the PM said there was ""no evidence"" of Russian interference in UK politics, amid calls for the government to release a report on the subject before the election. He also said there were ""big plans"" for investing in flood defences. And he said claims none of his children went to state school were ""wrong"". He alsodenied reports that Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage had been offered a peeragein return for standing down his parliamentary candidates in Conservative-won seats. LIVE: Latest from election campaign The mystery of the Russia report 'Shameful' not to publish Russia report - Clinton Boris Johnson phone-in fact-checked On Russia, the prime minister was asked why the government was not publishing Parliament's Intelligence Security Committee (ISC) report before the 12 December election. It includes evidence from UK intelligence services concerning alleged Russian attempts to influence the outcome of the 2016 EU referendum and 2017 general election. The process for clearing it on security grounds was completed in October, but it has since been with Downing Street awaiting final release. ISC chairman Dominic Grieve says the document, finalised in March, contains information relevant to voters. This video can not be played Hillary Clinton called on the UK to publish an intelligence report on Russian covert actions And earlier this month Hillary Clinton told the BBC it was ""inexplicable and shameful"" that the UK government had not yet published it. On 5 Live and the News Channel, the prime minister said he saw ""absolutely no reason to change the normal procedures for publishing ISC (Intelligence Security Committee) reports just because there is an election"". He said the publication process was ""not normally"" any quicker. On the possibility of Russian interference in UK politics, the prime minister said: ""There's no evidence of that and you've got to be very careful... you simply can't cast aspersions on everybody who comes from a certain country, just because of their nationality."" It is understood Mr Grieve had hoped to publish the ""informative"" report on 28 October. Previous disclosures would suggest these Russian activities did not match the scale of those directed against the 2016 US presidential election, and even in that case, there is considerable debate about how far people were actually influenced by these actions. But Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has said: ""If a report has been called for and written, and it should be in the public domain, then what have they got to hide?"" In a wide-ranging question-and-answer session, Mr Johnson was asked how many Russian oligarchs donated to the Conservative Party He replied: ""All donations to the Conservative Party are properly vetted, properly publicised. ""I'll leave it to your teams of researchers to bring that fact before us. It's all there in the public."" Mr Johnson said the government had ""big plans"" and wanted to invest ""massively"" in flood defences. What are the factors making floods worse? Labour and Lib Dems criticise floods response Mr Johnson unveiled the Conservatives' campaign bus at an event in Manchester. The prime minister went on to criticise Labour's spending plans, arguing they would leave the country in ""great jeopardy"". Mr Johnson said he had ""not the faintest idea"" whether voters would be able to relate to him. ""That's a matter for other people - I can't possibly say 'I am relatable,'"" he told BBC Breakfast, ahead of his 5 live and News Channel appearance. ""It seems to me the most difficult psychological question that anyone's ever asked me."" This video can not be played Boris Johnson: 'Am I relatable? I've not the faintest idea' When asked on BBC Radio 5 and the News Channel if he had any children who went to state school, Mr Johnson replied: ""I don't comment about my children.""

"This video can not be played Prince Andrew: ""I let the side down, simple as that"" The Duke of York has said he ""let the side down"" by staying at the home of convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, adding it was the ""wrong thing to do"". Answering questions about his links to Epstein for the first time, Prince Andrew said his stay was not ""becoming of a member of the Royal Family"". The prince spoke to BBC Newsnight's Emily Maitlis in an interview recorded at Buckingham Palace on Thursday. It will be broadcast onBBC Two at 21:00 GMT on Saturday. Explained: Who was Jeffrey Epstein? Timeline: Prince Andrew's links to Epstein Prince Andrew, who is the Queen's third child, has been facing questions for several months over his ties to Epstein, a 66-year-old American financier who took his own life while awaiting trial on sex-trafficking charges. In 2010, the prince was photographed walking with Epstein in New York's Central Park -two years after Epstein's convictionfor soliciting a minor for prostitution. Footagepublished by the Mail on Sunday,externalshowed the prince in Epstein's Manhattan mansion at about the same time. Addressing his decision to stay with Epstein following the American's first conviction, Prince Andrew said: ""That's the bit thatâ¦ as it were, I kick myself for on a daily basis because it was not something that was becoming of a member of the Royal Family and we try and uphold the highest standards and practices and I let the side down, simple as that."" Challenged on his decision to stay at the home of a convicted sex offender, the prince said: ""It was a convenient place to stay. ""I mean I've gone through this in my mind so many times. At the end of the day, with a benefit of all the hindsight that one can have, it was definitely the wrong thing to do. ""But at the time I felt it was the honourable and right thing to do and I admit fully that my judgement was probably coloured by my tendency to be too honourable but that's just the way it is."" Prince Andrew and Jeffrey Epstein go for a stroll together through New York's Central Park In 2015, Prince Andrew was named in court papers as part of a US civil case against Epstein. One of Epstein's accusers, Virginia Roberts - now Virginia Giuffre - said she was forced to have sex with the prince three times between 2001 - when she was 17 - and 2002, in London, New York and on a private Caribbean island owned by Epstein. This video can not be played Virginia Giuffre: Prince Andrew ""knows exactly what he's done"" In the BBC interview, Emily Maitlis asks the prince about Ms Giuffre's claims that in 2001, she had dined with him, danced with him at a nightclub, and went on to have sex with him at the house of a friend of the prince in Belgravia, central London. The prince replied: ""It didn't happen. I have no recollection of ever meeting this lady, none whatsoever."" When asked once more whether he remembered meeting Ms Giuffre, the prince said: ""No."" Ms Giuffre says she was abused by the prince in Ghislaine Maxwell's London home, where she was pictured in 2001 Details of Ms Giuffre's claims against the prince were later officially struck from court records when a judge ruled they were unnecessary to the case, saying they were ""immaterial and impertinent"" to the ""central claim"". Separately, a woman called Johanna Sjoberg alleged that the prince touched her breast while they sat on a couch in Epstein's Manhattan apartment in 2001 in documents from a defamation case. Buckingham Palace has issued strong denials of all allegations against the prince. And Prince Andrew's ex-wife, Sarah Ferguson,wrote on Friday,externalthat the prince was a ""true [and] real gentleman and is stoically steadfast not only [in] his duty but also his kindness"". In 2015, a statement from the palace said that ""any suggestion of impropriety with underage minors"" by the prince was ""categorically untrue"". The prince first met Epstein in 1999 and they saw each other on several occasions after that. In 2005, the parents of a 14-year-old girl told police in Florida that Epstein had molested their daughter at his Palm Beach home. Prosecutors forged a deal with Epstein in 2008, which saw him avoid federal charges. He instead received an 18-month prison sentence, during which he was able to go on ""work release"" to his office for 12 hours a day, six days a week. He was released on probation after 13 months. In a statement released by Buckingham Palace in August, the prince said he was ""appalled"" by the sex abuse claims surrounding his former friend. The statement added: ""His royal highness deplores the exploitation of any human being and the suggestion he would condone, participate in or encourage any such behaviour is abhorrent."" This video can not be played Prince Andrew and Jeffrey Epstein: What we know and what we don't Discussing how the BBC's interview was secured, Emily Maitlis told Newsnight on Friday that talks with the palace had been ongoing for ""many months"" and had intensified following Epstein's death.

"This video can not be played Boris Johnson: ""Nobody's been offered a peerage"" Boris Johnson has said claims that Brexit Party election candidates have been offered peerages to encourage them to stand down are ""nonsense"". Leader Nigel Farage has said senior figures have been offered inducements, such as government jobs, in return for not running against Conservatives. Ann Widdecombe, a Brexit Party candidate, said she would swear on the Bible she had been approached. The PM told the BBC that ""certainly no-one's been offered a peerage"". Taking part in a question-and-answer session on Radio 5 Live, he responded to Mr Farage's comments, telling host Rachel Burden: ""What is this nonsense? I am sure there are conversations that take place between politicians of all parties but certainly nobody's been offered a peerage."" Conservative Party chairman James Cleverly said claims that places in the House of Lords had been dangled in front of their political opponents were ""completely unfounded"". Meanwhile, former lord chancellor and Labour peer Lord Falconer has written to the Metropolitan Police and the Director of Public Prosecutions asking them to investigate Mr Farage's claims. Lord Falconer said he believed that the alleged offers could, if proven, amount to a ""significant"" attempt to influence the election and that authorities should ""investigate now"". The Met Police said it had received two allegations of electoral fraud and malpractice, which are both currently being assessed. It added it would not comment about individual cases. As it happened: Election campaign latest Farage: Tories should stand down in Labour seats The Brexit Party is not contesting seats won by the Conservatives at the 2017 general election, but will put up candidates against the party elsewhere, including in many Labour-held marginal constituencies that Mr Johnson hopes to win to secure a parliamentary majority. Conservatives have urged Mr Farage to reconsider, saying he risks splitting the pro-Brexit vote and allowing Labour - which wants another Brexit referendum - to retain dozens of seats. Some Brexit Party candidates in marginal Labour seats, such as Rupert Lowe in Dudley North, have decided to withdraw of their own accord. In a video posted on Twitter on Thursday,external, Mr Farage said that he, along with eight ""senior figures"" in his party, had been offered jobs ""in the (Brexit) negotiating team and in government departments"" while there had been ""hints at peerages too"". Ann Widdecombe said she had had two conversations with ""someone"" in Downing Street He said the offer had been made by people ""deep inside Number 10 Downing Street"" - although he did not think Mr Johnson was involved. Ms Widdecombe, a former Tory minister who is standing for the Brexit Party in Plymouth Sutton and Devonport, said she had initially been approached by ""someone at Downing Street"" who told her she had a ""moral obligation"" to stand down. In a subsequent conversation, the MEP said, she had been offered ""a role"" in the next phase of Brexit negotiations over the UK's future relationship with the EU. ""I have no idea what that means,"" she told the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire show. ""I immediately said that I had played no role in the Tory party for a large number of years and that I couldn't now be flattered, buttered up or promised things."" Where are the seats that could turn the election? A really simple guide to the UK general election As a practising Catholic, she said was ""prepared to put her hand on the book (Bible) over this"". A Conservative source has told the BBC the Brexit Party candidate in Peterborough was offered an unpaid role in education in the hope it would convince him to stand aside. Mike Greene is standing for the party in the Cambridgeshire constituency, which Labour held narrowly at a by-election in June.

"This video can not be played Prince Andrew: ""I let the side down, simple as that"" The Duke of York has said he ""let the side down"" by staying at the home of convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, adding it was the ""wrong thing to do"". Answering questions about his links to Epstein for the first time, Prince Andrew said his stay was not ""becoming of a member of the Royal Family"". The prince spoke to BBC Newsnight's Emily Maitlis in an interview recorded at Buckingham Palace on Thursday. It will be broadcast onBBC Two at 21:00 GMT on Saturday. Explained: Who was Jeffrey Epstein? Timeline: Prince Andrew's links to Epstein Prince Andrew, who is the Queen's third child, has been facing questions for several months over his ties to Epstein, a 66-year-old American financier who took his own life while awaiting trial on sex-trafficking charges. In 2010, the prince was photographed walking with Epstein in New York's Central Park -two years after Epstein's convictionfor soliciting a minor for prostitution. Footagepublished by the Mail on Sunday,externalshowed the prince in Epstein's Manhattan mansion at about the same time. Addressing his decision to stay with Epstein following the American's first conviction, Prince Andrew said: ""That's the bit thatâ¦ as it were, I kick myself for on a daily basis because it was not something that was becoming of a member of the Royal Family and we try and uphold the highest standards and practices and I let the side down, simple as that."" Challenged on his decision to stay at the home of a convicted sex offender, the prince said: ""It was a convenient place to stay. ""I mean I've gone through this in my mind so many times. At the end of the day, with a benefit of all the hindsight that one can have, it was definitely the wrong thing to do. ""But at the time I felt it was the honourable and right thing to do and I admit fully that my judgement was probably coloured by my tendency to be too honourable but that's just the way it is."" Prince Andrew and Jeffrey Epstein go for a stroll together through New York's Central Park In 2015, Prince Andrew was named in court papers as part of a US civil case against Epstein. One of Epstein's accusers, Virginia Roberts - now Virginia Giuffre - said she was forced to have sex with the prince three times between 2001 - when she was 17 - and 2002, in London, New York and on a private Caribbean island owned by Epstein. This video can not be played Virginia Giuffre: Prince Andrew ""knows exactly what he's done"" In the BBC interview, Emily Maitlis asks the prince about Ms Giuffre's claims that in 2001, she had dined with him, danced with him at a nightclub, and went on to have sex with him at the house of a friend of the prince in Belgravia, central London. The prince replied: ""It didn't happen. I have no recollection of ever meeting this lady, none whatsoever."" When asked once more whether he remembered meeting Ms Giuffre, the prince said: ""No."" Ms Giuffre says she was abused by the prince in Ghislaine Maxwell's London home, where she was pictured in 2001 Details of Ms Giuffre's claims against the prince were later officially struck from court records when a judge ruled they were unnecessary to the case, saying they were ""immaterial and impertinent"" to the ""central claim"". Separately, a woman called Johanna Sjoberg alleged that the prince touched her breast while they sat on a couch in Epstein's Manhattan apartment in 2001 in documents from a defamation case. Buckingham Palace has issued strong denials of all allegations against the prince. And Prince Andrew's ex-wife, Sarah Ferguson,wrote on Friday,externalthat the prince was a ""true [and] real gentleman and is stoically steadfast not only [in] his duty but also his kindness"". In 2015, a statement from the palace said that ""any suggestion of impropriety with underage minors"" by the prince was ""categorically untrue"". The prince first met Epstein in 1999 and they saw each other on several occasions after that. In 2005, the parents of a 14-year-old girl told police in Florida that Epstein had molested their daughter at his Palm Beach home. Prosecutors forged a deal with Epstein in 2008, which saw him avoid federal charges. He instead received an 18-month prison sentence, during which he was able to go on ""work release"" to his office for 12 hours a day, six days a week. He was released on probation after 13 months. In a statement released by Buckingham Palace in August, the prince said he was ""appalled"" by the sex abuse claims surrounding his former friend. The statement added: ""His royal highness deplores the exploitation of any human being and the suggestion he would condone, participate in or encourage any such behaviour is abhorrent."" This video can not be played Prince Andrew and Jeffrey Epstein: What we know and what we don't Discussing how the BBC's interview was secured, Emily Maitlis told Newsnight on Friday that talks with the palace had been ongoing for ""many months"" and had intensified following Epstein's death. She said the prince had to seek the approval of the Queen and that ""she gave sign off either late on Monday or very early on Tuesday"".

"Some 181 apps will no longer be available on iPhones Apple is removing all vaping apps from its online store. It said it had taken the decision because of growing official concerns about the impact vaping can have on health. In the US,42 deaths and more than 2,100 cases of lung injury,externalhave been linked to a respiratory illness tied to vaping. Apple's decision means a total of 181 apps will not be available on iPhones,reports tech news site Axios.,external In a statement given to Axios, Apple said it agreed with official warnings about the negative health impacts of vaping and the potential problem presented by the appeal of e-cigarettes to the young. It said it took ""great care"" to ensure that the app store was a place people could trust to get programs for their iPhone. The vaping apps available via Apple's store let people exercise control of some features of e-cigarettes and others simply kept people up to date with news about vaping or offered themed games. Apple said anyone who already had a vaping app on their iPhone would be able to continue using it and transfer it to any new Apple device. The move to eliminate vaping apps began in June when Apple decided to stop accepting any new apps related to e-cigarettes. Research by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) into the causes of the respiratory disease that caused the deaths suggests one ingredient is to blame. The CDC said it had found vitamin E acetate - a thickening agent used in many illegal vaping products - in lung samples from 29 patients hit by the disease.

"The mother of a 10-year-old girl who died at a Glasgow children's hospital claims she was ""let down and lied to"" by health officials. Milly Main contracted an infection in 2017 while recovering from leukaemia at the Royal Hospital for Children. Her mother told the BBC she was ""100%"" certain contaminated water caused the fatal infection. Greater Glasgow health board insists the source of the infection cannot be determined. Kimberly Darroch gave details of her daughter's case after it washighlighted in the Scottish Parliament on Thursday,prompting calls for the resignation of Health Secretary Jeane Freeman. This video can not be played Kimberly Darroch believes she was let down over her daughter's death Ms Darroch said she emailed Ms Freeman in September ""asking for answers"" about her daughter's death but received only general assurances that it would be considered as part of an official inquiry. Ms Freeman said she instructed officials to get in contact with the family and did not make a public statement out of respect for patient confidentiality. Milly's mother described breaking down in tears when she read in theDaily Record newspaper,externalon Thursday that an unpublicised clinician-led review had identified 26 infection cases in 2017 possibly linked to contaminated water on the cancer ward -  including one that led to the death of a child. ""I feel let down but lied to. I don't know how to put it into words. There are no words to be honest I'm in shock, complete shock with it all,"" she said. Milly seriously ill in hospital after contracting an infection while recovering from leukaemia Milly, who had leukaemia, underwent a successful stem cell transplant in July 2017 and was making a good recovery when the following month her Hickman line, a catheter used to administer drugs, became infected. Milly went into toxic shock and died some days later. Her death certificate lists a Stenotrophomonas infection of the Hickman line among the possible causes of death but Ms Darroch says the family were kept in the dark about a potential link to contaminated water problems at the hospital. Milly's death certificate lists the Hickman line infection as a possible factor in her death She said shower heads were changed in the months before her daughter's death, and she is convinced the water supply was the source of the  infection. ""I think they knew prior to Milly's death that the water was contaminated. I feel they knew this was the infection that killed my daughter but no-one came forward to tell us."" Health secretary resignation call over child death Freeman did not make child infection death public She added: ""If they had told us at the time it would have been a hard pill to swallow but I would have swallowed it if they had just been honest."" Milly's mother said she emailed the health secretary in September asking for answers In September she emailed the health secretary asking for answers about her daughter's death. ""I emailed Jeane Freeman and got a reply 10 days later saying they would look into it and get back to me. ""They did get back to me a number of weeks later with a generic letter. It was addressed to myself and was slightly personal - but not very personal - saying they were holding an inquiry and they would pass it on to the health board's complaints manager. "" Asked what she wanted to happen next, she said: ""I think they should get the answers from the inquiry and release them. I want an apology. I want them to admit what they've done is wrong and I want them to admit that they've covered it up."" NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde said at the time there was no requirement to test the water supply for Stenotrophomonas. In a statement it said: ""We have offered to meet Mrs Darroch to discuss her concerns, and to answer her questions where we can. ""We fully understand that the family wants to know whether the infection Milly had is connected to the water supply. ""The truth is there is no way to know this as we did not consider this to be the source at the time and we did not test for the particular infection in the water supply."" Jeane Freeman said she wished to respect the family's right to confidentiality Health Secretary Jeane Freeman said the email from Milly's mother in September was the first time she was made aware of the child's death. She said: ""On 23 October I wrote to the parent expressing my condolences for their very sad loss and I would like to again take this opportunity to do so. ""I also advised them that I was ensuring that senior staff from NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde would make personal contact with them to address the questions I was sure they would have. ""Following my intervention I have checked and been assured that communication has been established, which will provide the necessary information for the family. ""I also made clear to the parent my intention that the public inquiry will be an opportunity for the voices of families to be heard and for answers to be provided. ""I am at all times aware of the importance of patient confidentiality and so, rightly I believe, I did not treat this correspondence as a public matter."" The problem of contaminated water is one of a number to beset the Queen Elizabeth University Hospital (QEUH) and the adjoining Royal Hospital for Children. Last year two cancer wards at the children's hospital were shut because of concerns about infection, and children were moved to the QEUH instead. An inquiry by Health Protection Scotland later identified 23 potentially water supply-linked infections during 2018. In January it emerged two patients at the QEUH had died after contracting an infection linked to pigeon droppings. Ms Freeman recently announced a public inquiry into construction issues at both the Glasgow ""super hospital"" site and the new children's hospital in Edinburgh. Scottish Labour MSP Anas Sarwar raised Milly's case at First Minister's Questions after a whistleblower revealed an unreported clinician-led review had identified 26 possible water supply-related infections in 2017 at the children's hospital. Mr Sarwar said: ""Milly's family deserve answers. It's the health secretary's job to protect patients and the staff, not the institution. ""They deserve answers and they deserve the the truth and those NHS staff who showed bravery in coming forward to be whistleblowers deserve to be protected."" Scottish Liberal Democrat health spokesman Alex Cole-Hamilton said Ms Freeman's decision not to go public was ""incomprehensible"" and called on her to make a statement at Holyrood on the issue. The Scottish Conservatives called on the health secretary to resign over the case. Tory health spokesman Miles Briggs said: ""Patients will be absolutely furious that such a serious failure has been covered up by this SNP government. ""The health secretary must apologise to the family and resign or, if she refuses, be sacked.""

"Taylor Swift is in a dispute with Scooter Braun (centre) and Scott Borchetta Taylor Swift's former record label has rebuffed her claims it is blocking her from performing her own hits at the forthcoming American Music Awards. The singer said music executives Scooter Braun and Scott Borchetta would not let her perform songs from her past albums, which they own the rights to. She said a Netflix documentary about her life had also been put in jeopardy. Borchetta and Braun's Big Machine Records said Swift's statement was ""based on false information"". Swift v Braun: Personal or strictly business? Taylor Swift 'bullied' by man who now owns her music Swift made the allegations in a statement posted to Twitter with the caption: ""Don't know what else to do."" Allow Twitter content?

""Right now my performance at the AMAs, the Netflix documentary and any other recorded events I am planning to play until November 2020 are a question mark,"" she wrote. But in response, the label denied telling the pop superstar she could not perform at the AMAs or trying to block the Netflix special, and said the ""narrative you have created does not exist"". Swift is being named Artist of the Decade at this month's AMAs In June, Swift revealed thatthe masters of her early music had been sold to Braun by her former record label, run by Borchetta, and alleged that she was not told about it. At the time the singer accused Braun, who also manages Ariana Grande, Justin Bieber and Demi Lovato, of ""incessant, manipulative bullying"". Swift also accused Braun of attempting to ""dismantle"" her ""musical legacy"".,externalWhile he did not respond to her comments, he was supported by Lovato and Bieber, who claimed Swift was just out ""to get sympathy"". The singer confirmed in August that she planned to re-record music from her first six albums so she could own the rights to the new versions. Swift is set to be named Artist of the Decade at the AMAs later this month and said she had been planning to perform a medley of her hits. But in her statement on Thursday, she said the two men had blocked her from performing her old songs on television, claiming that this would be re-recording her music before she is allowed to next year. They also blocked the use of her older music or performance footage in the upcoming Netflix film, she claimed. Swift alleged that Borchetta told her team she would only be allowed to use the music if she agreed ""not to re-record copycat versions"" next year and stopped talking about the two men. ""The message being sent to me is very clear. Basically, be a good little girl and shut up. Or you'll be punished,"" she wrote. She went on to ask her fans to help to pressure Braun and Borchetta into changing their minds and to appeal to the artists they manage for help. She also asked for help from the private equity firm The Carlyle Group, which she said financed the sale. Fans responded instantly, with the hashtags ""IStandWithTaylor"" and ""FreeTaylor"" trending on Twitter. Ina statement,external, the Big Machine Label Group said it had been optimistic about resolving the long-running dispute - until Swift posted her statement on Thursday. ""Despite our persistent efforts to find a private and mutually satisfactory solution, Taylor made a unilateral decision last night to enlist her fanbase in a calculated manner that greatly affects the safety of our employees and their families,"" the label said. In June, Scooter Braun (right) bought Big Machine, which Borchetta founded in 2005 ""Taylor, the narrative you have created does not exist. All we ask is to have a direct and honest conversation. When that happens, you will see there is nothing but respect, kindness and support waiting for you on the other side."" Big Machine also said: ""At no point did we say Taylor could not perform on the AMAs or block her Netflix special. In fact, we do not have the right to keep her from performing live anywhere."" It did not specifically address whether she could perform old songs. In response,the singer's publicist Tree Paine insisted,externalthat Borchetta ""flatly denied the request for both American Music Awards and Netflix"". Both sides also claim the other owes them millions of dollars. Borchetta founded Big Machine in 2005, and the company was bought by Braun's Ithaca Holdings in June. Stars including Halsey, Gigi Hadid and BBC Radio 1 DJ Greg James have leapt to the singer's defence. Fellow pop singer Halsey said: ""These people are protected because they inspire complicity with fear. ""Banking on the illusion that people will not stand up for her. That the world will say she is over-reacting, You're barking up the wrong tree. ""It is her grace and patience in these moments that make her artist of the decade,"" she added.

After Braun bought most of the US pop star's life's work, thanks to his acquisition of her former record label Big Machine for $300m (Â£237m) in June, Tim Ingham from Music Business Worldwidetold the BBCin July that these kind of contract arrangements were fairly common in the days before music streaming. ""Unfortunately for Taylor Swift, she started recording at a time in the history of the industry when it was still heavily reliant on radio, where you needed a record company backing to get you on radio, particularly country radio in Nashville, where Big Machine was a huge player,"" said Ingham. ""And also, you needed to rely on physical distribution to get your CDs into stores. So she needed a record company to invest the amount of money that they had to invest to get her career off the ground."" Mark Sutherland, editor of trade publication Music Week, agreed in July with Ingham that Braun's business decisions will most likely be driven by money.

"This video can not be played Trump's live-tweets ""very intimidating"" - Yovanovitch US President Donald Trump has attacked the former US ambassador to Ukraine, Marie Yovanovitch, on Twitter, in the middle of her testimony to the impeachment inquiry. ""Everywhere Marie Yovanovitch went turned bad,"" Mr Trump wrote. ""She started off in Somalia, how did that go?"" Asked for her response, Ms Yovanovitch called it ""very intimidating"". Mr Trump later hit back, arguing his tweets were not intimidating ""at all"". He told reporters he had watched part of the impeachment hearing and considered it ""a disgrace"". While giving her evidence, Ms Yovanovitch was alerted to the president's criticism by hearing chairman Adam Schiff. Responding directly to Mr Trump's tweet, in which he appeared to blame her for upheaval in Somalia, Ms Yovanovitch replied: ""I don't think I have such powers, not in Mogadishu and Somalia and not in other places. ""I actually think that where I've served over the years I and others have demonstrably made things better, you know, for the US as well as for the countries that I've served in. Her response was broadcast live during the televised hearing. Friday's testimony: How it unfolded The impeachment story explained Who's who in Trump whistleblower story? What Trump's Ukraine phone call really means Mr Schiff, the Democratic Chairman of the Intelligence Committee overseeing the impeachment inquiry, suggested the president's tweets could be classed as witness intimidation. The inquiry is currently investigating whether Mr Trump withheld US military aid to Ukraine in order to pressure the country's new president to announce a corruption inquiry into former Vice-President Joe Biden, now his rival for the US presidency. Mr Trump denies any wrongdoing and has branded the proceedings ""presidential harassment"". This video can not be played A Democrat and a Republican react to the first public impeachment hearing Ms Yovanovitch was removed as ambassador to Kyiv in May, two months before a controversial phone call between Mr Trump and his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelensky, which is now key to the inquiry. A rough transcript of the call,externalrevealed that Mr Trump had urged President Zelensky to investigate unsubstantiated allegations against Mr Biden and his son Hunter, who sat on the board of a Ukrainian gas company. A US diplomatic aide told the impeachment inquiry he overheard a phone call President Trump had with the US envoy to the EU, Gordon Sondland, in which ""investigations"" are said to have been discussed. State department official David Holmes testified behind closed doors on Friday about the call by Mr Sondland, from a restaurant in Kyiv, to Mr Trump. According to a copy of his opening statement obtained by CBS News, Mr Holmes said: ""Sondland told Trump that [Ukrainian President] Zelensky 'loves your ass.'"" ""I then heard President Trump ask, 'So, he's gonna do the investigation?' ""Ambassador Sondland replied that 'he's gonna do it', adding that President Zelensky will do 'anything you ask him to'."" Mr Holmes' deposition appears to corroborate Wednesday's testimony to the impeachment inquiry by US ambassador to Ukraine Bill Taylor. He said one of his aides heard the same chat. The aide said Mr Trump had asked about ""investigations"" and Mr Sondland had replied that Ukraine was ready to move forward. According to Mr Taylor, Mr Sondland then told the aide that the president cared more about the investigation of the Bidens than anything else involving Ukraine. The call - which the US president has denied any knowledge of - allegedly happened on 26 July, the day after the now-famous Trump-Zelensky phone call. In earlier closed-door testimony, Ms Yovanovitch alleged she had fallen victim to a smear campaign at the hands of Mr Trump's personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani. She said Mr Giuliani had worked to discredit her while attempting to push Ukraine into the anti-Biden investigations. Why Ukraine is so important to the US How right-wing media covered impeachment hearings On Friday, the former envoy accused the US state department - headed by Mike Pompeo - of failing to resist ""foreign and corrupt interests"" she said had ""hijacked"" America's policy towards Ukraine. When Ms Yovanovitch left her post, she was replaced by Bill Taylor, the current acting ambassador to Ukraine. Mr Taylor has testified before the impeachment inquirythat a member of his staff overheard a telephone call in which the president inquired about ""the investigations"" into Mr Biden. Mr Trump has boasted that his conduct while in office - blunt language and shoot-from-the-hip tweeting - is ""modern-day presidential"". If so, welcome to a modern-day presidential impeachment hearing. Just over an hour into Marie Yovanovitch's testimony, Mr Trump launched the kind of Twitter fusillade that has become a regular part of his political repertoire. He questioned the ambassador's competence, noted that the Ukrainian president spoke unfavourably about her and pointed out that he has the right to fire diplomats at will. What makes the moment historic is that Committee Chair Adam Schiff gave Yovanovitch a chance to refute the president's tweet almost in real time. Democrats are already characterising the president's behaviour as witness intimidation - and the latest attack by the president against one of his own government employees. Republicans, whose reported strategy was to avoid directly impugning the reputation of a long-serving, well-respected diplomat, will once again find a president who has changed the rules of engagement on the fly. Read more from Anthony here In a break during the hearing, chairman Adam Schiff called the president's tweets about Ms Yovanovitch an effort to ""chill"" her and other witnesses who might come forward. He told reporters the ambassador had been ""smeared"" and ""recalled for no reason"", and was now experiencing ""witness intimidation in real-time by the president of United States"". Ken Starr, who served as special prosecutor during the impeachment of President Bill Clinton, said on Fox News that Mr Trump's comments showed ""extraordinarily poor judgement"". But Republicans rejected the intimidation claim. ""The witness is testifying. She wouldn't even have known about the quote, if Mr Schiff hadn't read the tweet,"" Representative Jim Jordan said.

Boris Johnson unveiled his campaign bus in Manchester Mr Farage meeting voters in Nottinghamshire Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage says one of his MEPs deliberately sabotaged any chance of fielding a candidate in a West Midlands constituency. He accuses Rupert Lowe of ""disgusting behaviour"" in withdrawing his nomination for the seat moments before the deadline, when no replacement could be found. Mr Loweannounced his withdrawal on Twitter,externalone minute before the nomination deadline for candidates yesterday, saying he did not want to split the pro-Brexit vote and let in Labour. Mr Farage apologises to party supporters in the constituency. ""I'm sorry - we have been double-crossed, let down badly by a man who has behaved dishonestly,"" he says. He has previously accused Conservatives of offering peerages and other inducements to his candidates in other constituencies to persuade them not to run.But the Tories have denied this. Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesman Ed Davey is accusing Labour and the Conservatives of spending plans that are ""fantasies"". In a speech in Yorkshire, he tells party supporters: ""Boris Johnson has snuck into Jeremy Cobynâs allotment and stolen his magic money tree."" Mr Davey promises to make sure Britain's budget is balanced throughout a Lib Dem government. But he also pledges Â£100bn of investment in reducing carbon emissions, Â£120bn on well-being and mental health, and Â£130bn for infrastructure. And he says the party would restore ""Britain's best trade agreement ever"" - membership of the EU. Labour and the Tories will struggle to deliver their spending plans after Brexit because it will be difficult to attract construction workers, he suggests. He also criticises Labour's plans to nationalise broadband and offer it free at the point of use. ""We won't put Big Brother in charge of your broadband,"" he says.   Earlier, the PM told BBC's 5 Live that the assertion his children have never been to state school ""was wrong"" but declined to say how many children he has.

Did you know Parliament has an official election artist? For the 12 December poll it's been revealed Nicky Hirst will take on the task. The London-based artist will produce a piece of work inspired by observations she makes during the campaign. The artwork will join the Parliamentary Art Collection, which documents and illustrates the history of Parliament over the centuries. Ms Hirst says taking on the role was ""an honour"". Her art is described as often taking something intangible and making it concrete and visible - such as the below examples. ""Being
the election artist is a rare opportunity to come to the campaign with an open
mind to observe and document what candidates are saying,"" Ms Hirst says. ""I want
to be as honest and transparent as possible about what I see as I immerse
myself in this world."" Confused by the latest election developments? Got a question

childcare and family benefits and finances, like this one from Andy Barnard in Maidenhead: Q - Does the year's maternity pay also
apply to fathers? A - Statutory maternity pay (SMP) is paid
for 39 weeks. For the first six weeks it is paid at 90% of their average weekly
earnings before tax. The following 33 weeks is paid at at Â£148.68 per week or
90% of their average weekly earnings, whichever is the lower. But some employers offer maternity pay that
is more than the statutory rate. Shared parental leave allows parents -
after birth or adoption - to share up to 50 weeks of leave and up to 37 weeks
of pay between them. Paternity leave is a period of either one or two
consecutive weeks that fathers or partners can take off from work to care for
their baby or child. The father or partner can receive statutory paternity pay
of Â£148.68 per week, provided they have worked for their company for 26 weeks. You

Rory Cellan-JonesTechnology correspondent Labour has said building the British Broadband network will cost Â£20 billion and once completed running costs will amount to Â£230 million per year. A source at BT has pointed out that Openreach has 33,000 employees and shadow chancellor John McDonnell has guaranteed that none will lose their jobs. The source says that operational expenses figure equates to a salary of less than Â£7,000 per employee. Boris Johnson has put his address as 11, not 10, Downing
Streetin a statement of candidates for the Uxbridge and South Ruislip constituency.,external Thatâs because he lives in the larger flat above 11 Downing
Street, while Chancellor Sajid Javid lives in the smaller No 10 flat. When Theresa May and David Cameron went to the polls as prime minister, they each listed their constituency homes as their addresses. Mr Johnson does not have an address in Uxbridge. Hillary Clinton pictured in London while promoting her book earlier this week Hillary Clinton has criticised the ""heavily misogynistic"" atmosphere online which has seen female parliamentary candidates announce they are not standing in the general election. The former US secretary of state highlighted the ""intimidation"" faced by female politicians at a panel discussion at Swansea University. Mrs Clinton - whose grandparents were Welsh - said: ""Unfortunately, the atmosphere online is heavily misogynistic because apparently the people, and it's predominantly, though not exclusively, men who spend their time going after women of prominence in whatever field they are in and just can't let it go.
"" ""What they say is often vile, and when I was in London over the last few days, a number of people told me about women not standing for Parliament this time because of the threats they have received. ""And it's really particular to them. Threats of death and terrible attacks, including going after their families, in particular mentioning their children."" The former US presidential candidate said she had met with an unnamed female politician who decided not to stand in the 12 December election because, Mrs Clinton was told, ""I just can't take it"". Here's our piece from last month about women MPs saying abuse forced them from politics. Mrs Clinton said: ""It is a terrible loss and a loss to democracy if anybody is intimidated out of running, and disproportionately the people choosing not to run in the first instance or for re-election are women."" Mrs Clinton led the panel entitled Gutsy Welsh Women - a nod to her new book, co-authored with her daughter Chelsea - alongside senior education figures in Wales. Boris Johnson on a visit to Coronation Candy in Blackpool Jeremy Corbyn holds up a painting given to him by a local artist during a speech in Morecambe Earlier today when answering questions from the public, the prime minister said that the Tories would invest Â£500m to reverse the cuts to railway lines and stations made in the 1960s. More than 5,000 miles of track and nearly 1,500 stations closed between 1964 and 1970, after a report by British Railways chairman Richard Beeching. But rail experts say that the money is not enough to restore services to all the places cut off by those cuts. ""It is not going to buy you very much railway. A rebuilt railway costs millions for each kilometre,"" says Sim Harris, managing editor of industry newspaper Railnews. ""It would cost far more than that to really reverse Beeching."" The Conservatives say that among the possible locations for new or reopened lines are Ashington, Seaton Delaval and Blyth in Northumberland; Skelmersdale in Lancashire; Thornton-Cleveleys and Fleetwood in Lancashire; and Willenhall and Darlaston in the West Midlands. But the party has not provided any more details on how it would fund a reversal of the Beeching cuts.

Reality Check Prime Minister Boris Johnson took questions from the public in a phone-in broadcast on 5 Live and the BBC News Channel earlier today.

The plan would see millions more properties given access to a full-fibre connection, though Prime Minister Boris Johnson said it was ""a crackpot scheme"". But if the plan went ahead and was completed on time, would it still be useful in 2030?Read our full story here. One of the comparisons that shadow chancellor John McDonnell made in setting out his plans for part-nationalising BT to provide free fibre optic broadband was with South Korea. Mr McDonnell said the country has 98% coverage with full-fibre broadband, compared to 8% to 10% in the UK. But BBC economics editor Faisal Islam says the comparison doesn't completely stand up. While South Korea has state involvement in planning and coordinating the building of fibre infrastructure, it isn't run by state-owned companies. Instead, it is mostly privately funded in a ""super-competitive market"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"Taylor Swift is in a dispute with Scooter Braun (centre) and Scott Borchetta Taylor Swift's former record label has rebuffed her claims it is blocking her from performing her own hits at the forthcoming American Music Awards. The singer said music executives Scooter Braun and Scott Borchetta would not let her perform songs from her past albums, which they own the rights to. She said a Netflix documentary about her life had also been put in jeopardy. Borchetta and Braun's Big Machine Records said Swift's statement was ""based on false information"". Swift v Braun: Personal or strictly business? Taylor Swift 'bullied' by man who now owns her music Swift made the allegations in a statement posted to Twitter with the caption: ""Don't know what else to do."" Allow Twitter content?

""Right now my performance at the AMAs, the Netflix documentary and any other recorded events I am planning to play until November 2020 are a question mark,"" she wrote. But in response, the label denied telling the pop superstar she could not perform at the AMAs or trying to block the Netflix special, and said the ""narrative you have created does not exist"". Swift is being named Artist of the Decade at this month's AMAs In June, Swift revealed thatthe masters of her early music had been sold to Braun by her former record label, run by Borchetta, and alleged that she was not told about it. At the time the singer accused Braun, who also manages Ariana Grande, Justin Bieber and Demi Lovato, of ""incessant, manipulative bullying"". Swift also accused Braun of attempting to ""dismantle"" her ""musical legacy"".,externalWhile he did not respond to her comments, he was supported by Lovato and Bieber, who claimed Swift was just out ""to get sympathy"". The singer confirmed in August that she planned to re-record music from her first six albums so she could own the rights to the new versions. Swift is set to be named Artist of the Decade at the AMAs later this month and said she had been planning to perform a medley of her hits. But in her statement on Thursday, she said the two men had blocked her from performing her old songs on television, claiming that this would be re-recording her music before she is allowed to next year. They also blocked the use of her older music or performance footage in the upcoming Netflix film, she claimed. Swift alleged that Borchetta told her team she would only be allowed to use the music if she agreed ""not to re-record copycat versions"" next year and stopped talking about the two men. ""The message being sent to me is very clear. Basically, be a good little girl and shut up. Or you'll be punished,"" she wrote. She went on to ask her fans to help to pressure Braun and Borchetta into changing their minds and to appeal to the artists they manage for help. She also asked for help from the private equity firm The Carlyle Group, which she said financed the sale. Fans responded instantly, with the hashtags ""IStandWithTaylor"" and ""FreeTaylor"" trending on Twitter. Ina statement,external, the Big Machine Label Group said it had been optimistic about resolving the long-running dispute - until Swift posted her statement on Thursday. ""Despite our persistent efforts to find a private and mutually satisfactory solution, Taylor made a unilateral decision last night to enlist her fanbase in a calculated manner that greatly affects the safety of our employees and their families,"" the label said. In June, Scooter Braun (right) bought Big Machine, which Borchetta founded in 2005 ""Taylor, the narrative you have created does not exist. All we ask is to have a direct and honest conversation. When that happens, you will see there is nothing but respect, kindness and support waiting for you on the other side."" Big Machine also said: ""At no point did we say Taylor could not perform on the AMAs or block her Netflix special. In fact, we do not have the right to keep her from performing live anywhere."" It did not specifically address whether she could perform old songs. In response,the singer's publicist Tree Paine insisted,externalthat Borchetta ""flatly denied the request for both American Music Awards and Netflix"". Both sides also claim the other owes them millions of dollars. Borchetta founded Big Machine in 2005, and the company was bought by Braun's Ithaca Holdings in June. Stars including Halsey, Gigi Hadid and BBC Radio 1 DJ Greg James have leapt to the singer's defence. Fellow pop singer Halsey said: ""These people are protected because they inspire complicity with fear. ""Banking on the illusion that people will not stand up for her. That the world will say she is over-reacting, You're barking up the wrong tree. ""It is her grace and patience in these moments that make her artist of the decade,"" she added.

After Braun bought most of the US pop star's life's work, thanks to his acquisition of her former record label Big Machine for $300m (Â£237m) in June, Tim Ingham from Music Business Worldwidetold the BBCin July that these kind of contract arrangements were fairly common in the days before music streaming. ""Unfortunately for Taylor Swift, she started recording at a time in the history of the industry when it was still heavily reliant on radio, where you needed a record company backing to get you on radio, particularly country radio in Nashville, where Big Machine was a huge player,"" said Ingham. ""And also, you needed to rely on physical distribution to get your CDs into stores. So she needed a record company to invest the amount of money that they had to invest to get her career off the ground."" Mark Sutherland, editor of trade publication Music Week, agreed in July with Ingham that Braun's business decisions will most likely be driven by money.

"This video can not be played Teresa Cheng is jostled in London China has condemned what it called an ""appalling attack"" by protesters on Hong Kong's justice secretary in London on Thursday evening. Teresa Cheng fell and was treated for an arm injury in hospital after being jostled by about 30 supporters of Hong Kong's pro-democracy movement. Chinese official Geng Shuang said some in the UK ""supported violent acts... to create chaos"" in its former colony. Hong Kong has been racked by five months of anti-government protests. The campaign started in opposition to a now-withdrawn plan to allow extradition to mainland China, but it has since morphed into wider demonstrations backing democracy and opposing the actions of the police. Hong Kong in first recession for a decade Hong Kong protests explained in 100 and 500 words The protests have continued unabated - Friday was the fifth consecutive day - and have often turned violent. On Thursday, a 70-year-old man died after being hit by a brick thrown during clashes. A murder inquiry has been opened. Hong Kong meanwhile confirmed it had entered its first recession for a decade, with the economy shrinking 3.2% in July to September, compared with the previous quarter. The justice secretary had been in Camden, north London, to promote Hong Kong as a dispute resolution and deal-making hub. Ms Cheng fell to the ground during the incident in Camden Video showed her walking towards a lecture at the Chartered Institute of Arbitrators (CIArb) when she was surrounded by a group of protesters. Some held signs and shouted ""murderer"" and in the melee, Ms Cheng fell to the ground. London's Metropolitan Police said they were investigating an allegation of assault and no arrests had yet been made. ""A woman was taken to hospital by London Ambulance Service suffering an injury to her arm,"" a statement said. In a statement, CIArb said Ms Cheng had been ""assaulted by a crowd"". But one of the protesters told the Guardian she had slipped trying to escape from the crowd and ""nobody laid a hand on her"". Tom Tugendhat, chair of parliament's foreign affairs committee, condemned the behaviour of the protesters. Ministers ""visiting the UK should be able to go about their business free from abuse and assault. This is not right"", he tweeted. Mr Geng, China's foreign ministry spokesman, said the attack was ""directly related to certain British politicians confusing right from wrong on the Hong Kong issue and their support for violent acts, giving a platform to those who are anti-China and want to create chaos in Hong Kong"". Hong Kong pushed to 'brink of total collapse' Hong Kong to close schools amid tense protests He said if the UK did not alter its approach ""and continues to add fuel to the fire, sow discord and instigate others"" it would ""bring calamity on itself"". He urged the UK to ""bring the culprits to justice and... also protect the safety and integrity of all Chinese people in the nation"". Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam also condemned the protesters in the UK,external, saying ""the savage act breached the bottom line of any civilised society"". Ms Cheng's office said she ""castigates the violent mob in London causing her serious bodily harm on her way to an event venue"". Protesters say Ms Cheng played a key role in pushing for the extradition bill. Protesters, including thousands of office workers, were on the streets again on Friday, many of them chanting ""stand with Hong Kong"". A number of roads were blocked and there was more disruption on the underground rail system. Black-clad protesters also continued to occupy university campuses. Roadblocks and other travel disruption continue unabated in Hong Kong It comes a day after Chinese President Xi Jinping warned the protests were threatening the ""one country, two systems"" policy under which Hong Kong retains a high level of autonomy and personal freedom unseen in mainland China. Police in Hong Kong are treating as murder the death of the 70-year-old hit by a brick during unrest in the border town of Sheung Shui on Wednesday. The government said the cleaner was on a lunch break when he was struck by ""hard objects hurled by masked rioters"". This video can not be played How Hong Kong got trapped in a cycle of violence Video purported to be of the incident shows two groups throwing bricks at each other before the man falls to the ground. On Monday, a police officer shot an activist in the torso with a live bullet, and a man was set on fire while arguing with anti-government protesters. A week ago, Alex Chow, a 22-year-old student, died after falling from a building during a police operation.

"The letter was sent to Anna Soubry at her constituency office in Nottingham A man who threatened Change UK leader Anna Soubry, referencing the murdered MP Jo Cox, has been jailed for a year. Alden Bryce Barlow, 55, of Milton Walk, Doncaster, South Yorkshire, sent a letter to Ms Soubry in her constituency in Nottingham. The message read: ""Cox was first, you are next"" and referred to Ms Soubry as ""treacherous"" and ""worthless"". He was jailed at Sheffield Crown Court and given a 10-year order preventing him from contacting Ms Soubry. He was also ordered not to go near Ms Soubry's constituency address in Nottingham. More stories from around Yorkshire The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) said the letter was addressed to her constituency office, and was opened by her constituency manager who called police. Jo Cox was murdered in 2016 in Birstall, West Yorkshire Barlow was traced by his fingerprints on the letter and from CCTV at the post office counter in the Doncaster branch of WH Smith, where he posted it. He was then charged with sending a letter conveying a threatening message, which he admitted. Chief Crown Prosecutor Gerry Wareham said: ""This letter contained a sickening and ominous threat to Ms Soubry, with an explicit reference to the murder of Jo Cox MP in 2016. ""Ms Soubry and her staff in the constituency office understandably found the message deeply disturbing and highly offensive. ""What is more, attacks such as this on our elected representatives are attacks on democracy and perpetrators will be prosecuted.""

Boris Johnson unveiled his campaign bus in Manchester Mr Farage meeting voters in Nottinghamshire Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage says one of his MEPs deliberately sabotaged any chance of fielding a candidate in a West Midlands constituency. He accuses Rupert Lowe of ""disgusting behaviour"" in withdrawing his nomination for the seat moments before the deadline, when no replacement could be found. Mr Loweannounced his withdrawal on Twitter,externalone minute before the nomination deadline for candidates yesterday, saying he did not want to split the pro-Brexit vote and let in Labour. Mr Farage apologises to party supporters in the constituency. ""I'm sorry - we have been double-crossed, let down badly by a man who has behaved dishonestly,"" he says. He has previously accused Conservatives of offering peerages and other inducements to his candidates in other constituencies to persuade them not to run.But the Tories have denied this. Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesman Ed Davey is accusing Labour and the Conservatives of spending plans that are ""fantasies"". In a speech in Yorkshire, he tells party supporters: ""Boris Johnson has snuck into Jeremy Cobynâs allotment and stolen his magic money tree."" Mr Davey promises to make sure Britain's budget is balanced throughout a Lib Dem government. But he also pledges Â£100bn of investment in reducing carbon emissions, Â£120bn on well-being and mental health, and Â£130bn for infrastructure. And he says the party would restore ""Britain's best trade agreement ever"" - membership of the EU. Labour and the Tories will struggle to deliver their spending plans after Brexit because it will be difficult to attract construction workers, he suggests. He also criticises Labour's plans to nationalise broadband and offer it free at the point of use. ""We won't put Big Brother in charge of your broadband,"" he says.   Earlier, the PM told BBC's 5 Live that the assertion his children have never been to state school ""was wrong"" but declined to say how many children he has.

Did you know Parliament has an official election artist? For the 12 December poll it's been revealed Nicky Hirst will take on the task. The London-based artist will produce a piece of work inspired by observations she makes during the campaign. The artwork will join the Parliamentary Art Collection, which documents and illustrates the history of Parliament over the centuries. Ms Hirst says taking on the role was ""an honour"". Her art is described as often taking something intangible and making it concrete and visible - such as the below examples. ""Being
the election artist is a rare opportunity to come to the campaign with an open
mind to observe and document what candidates are saying,"" Ms Hirst says. ""I want
to be as honest and transparent as possible about what I see as I immerse
myself in this world."" Confused by the latest election developments? Got a question

childcare and family benefits and finances, like this one from Andy Barnard in Maidenhead: Q - Does the year's maternity pay also
apply to fathers? A - Statutory maternity pay (SMP) is paid
for 39 weeks. For the first six weeks it is paid at 90% of their average weekly
earnings before tax. The following 33 weeks is paid at at Â£148.68 per week or
90% of their average weekly earnings, whichever is the lower. But some employers offer maternity pay that
is more than the statutory rate. Shared parental leave allows parents -
after birth or adoption - to share up to 50 weeks of leave and up to 37 weeks
of pay between them. Paternity leave is a period of either one or two
consecutive weeks that fathers or partners can take off from work to care for
their baby or child. The father or partner can receive statutory paternity pay
of Â£148.68 per week, provided they have worked for their company for 26 weeks. You

Rory Cellan-JonesTechnology correspondent Labour has said building the British Broadband network will cost Â£20 billion and once completed running costs will amount to Â£230 million per year. A source at BT has pointed out that Openreach has 33,000 employees and shadow chancellor John McDonnell has guaranteed that none will lose their jobs. The source says that operational expenses figure equates to a salary of less than Â£7,000 per employee. Boris Johnson has put his address as 11, not 10, Downing
Streetin a statement of candidates for the Uxbridge and South Ruislip constituency.,external Thatâs because he lives in the larger flat above 11 Downing
Street, while Chancellor Sajid Javid lives in the smaller No 10 flat. When Theresa May and David Cameron went to the polls as prime minister, they each listed their constituency homes as their addresses. Mr Johnson does not have an address in Uxbridge. Hillary Clinton pictured in London while promoting her book earlier this week Hillary Clinton has criticised the ""heavily misogynistic"" atmosphere online which has seen female parliamentary candidates announce they are not standing in the general election. The former US secretary of state highlighted the ""intimidation"" faced by female politicians at a panel discussion at Swansea University. Mrs Clinton - whose grandparents were Welsh - said: ""Unfortunately, the atmosphere online is heavily misogynistic because apparently the people, and it's predominantly, though not exclusively, men who spend their time going after women of prominence in whatever field they are in and just can't let it go.
"" ""What they say is often vile, and when I was in London over the last few days, a number of people told me about women not standing for Parliament this time because of the threats they have received. ""And it's really particular to them. Threats of death and terrible attacks, including going after their families, in particular mentioning their children."" The former US presidential candidate said she had met with an unnamed female politician who decided not to stand in the 12 December election because, Mrs Clinton was told, ""I just can't take it"". Here's our piece from last month about women MPs saying abuse forced them from politics. Mrs Clinton said: ""It is a terrible loss and a loss to democracy if anybody is intimidated out of running, and disproportionately the people choosing not to run in the first instance or for re-election are women."" Mrs Clinton led the panel entitled Gutsy Welsh Women - a nod to her new book, co-authored with her daughter Chelsea - alongside senior education figures in Wales. Boris Johnson on a visit to Coronation Candy in Blackpool Jeremy Corbyn holds up a painting given to him by a local artist during a speech in Morecambe Earlier today when answering questions from the public, the prime minister said that the Tories would invest Â£500m to reverse the cuts to railway lines and stations made in the 1960s. More than 5,000 miles of track and nearly 1,500 stations closed between 1964 and 1970, after a report by British Railways chairman Richard Beeching. But rail experts say that the money is not enough to restore services to all the places cut off by those cuts. ""It is not going to buy you very much railway. A rebuilt railway costs millions for each kilometre,"" says Sim Harris, managing editor of industry newspaper Railnews. ""It would cost far more than that to really reverse Beeching."" The Conservatives say that among the possible locations for new or reopened lines are Ashington, Seaton Delaval and Blyth in Northumberland; Skelmersdale in Lancashire; Thornton-Cleveleys and Fleetwood in Lancashire; and Willenhall and Darlaston in the West Midlands. But the party has not provided any more details on how it would fund a reversal of the Beeching cuts.

The plan would see millions more properties given access to a full-fibre connection, though Prime Minister Boris Johnson said it was ""a crackpot scheme"". But if the plan went ahead and was completed on time, would it still be useful in 2030?Read our full story here. One of the comparisons that shadow chancellor John McDonnell made in setting out his plans for part-nationalising BT to provide free fibre optic broadband was with South Korea. Mr McDonnell said the country has 98% coverage with full-fibre broadband, compared to 8% to 10% in the UK. But BBC economics editor Faisal Islam says the comparison doesn't completely stand up. While South Korea has state involvement in planning and coordinating the building of fibre infrastructure, it isn't run by state-owned companies.

"Adam Price: ""We had an extractive economy with a political power centre outside of our nation"" A Welsh Labour minister has accused Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price of using ""deliberately offensive terminology"" comparing the experience of Wales with colonialism. Vaughan Gething's comments follow an interview in which Mr Price said Wales had suffered a ""century of neglect"". Mr Price had argued that Wales had an ""extractive economy"" and ""political power centre outside of our nation"". This was ""analogous if not identical"" to the colonial experience, he said. Mr Price said it was a ""deliberate attempt to distract from the real issues"" by ""smearing"" him, and described it as ""ugly politics"". He said: ""We're suggesting some solutions to Wales' problems, what the Labour Party is trying to do is distract away from its responsibility as the party that's been in government in Wales for 20 years."" Compensate Wales for crippling poverty, says Price Labour's lack of BAME candidates 'disappointing' In the interview, with the think tank theInstitute of Welsh Affairs,external, Mr Price said Plaid Cymru wanted ""reparation for a century of neglect that has left a country, rich in its resources, a bitter legacy of poverty, sickness, blighted lives and broken dreams"". He said: ""I feel very strongly that it's not possible to understand the predicament we're in without acknowledging the centrality of the fact that we had an extractive economy with a political power centre outside of our nation. ""For most people that is analogous if not identical to the experience of colonialism."" Mr Price continued: ""The term internal colonialism was invented to describe the experience of African Americans in the United States. ""In fact, there is a quote from the 19th Century where they were referencing our experience - the Welsh inside the British Isles - in order to explain their own experience of internal colonialism. ""I don't think you can understand the predicament we've been left in without those two salient facts and the inter-relationship between the two."" Vaughan Gething said Mr Price should apologise for ""outrageous"" comments Responding, Mr Gething called on Mr Price to apologise. The minister told BBC Radio Wales Breakfast he was ""pretty staggered that he's chosen to use such deliberately offensive terminology that directly references the experience of Wales and colonialism, and further back slavery"". ""You just cannot compare the experience of Wales in the 19th and 20th Centuries with the experience of the emancipation campaign from slavery or indeed the state-backed racism that was visited upon African Americans in America,"" he said. Mr Gething said Wales itself had a direct role in the history of slavery. ""There's no surprise that some of the most popular African American surnames are Welsh ones,"" he said. ""And that's because, when they were finally given their freedom, they were given the names of their slave owners."" ""To try to say that the experience of Wales as a country and as a people is analogous to colonialism, is analogous to slavery, that is just outrageous,"" he said. Mr Gething also referred to his mother, who was born in the British colony of Northern Rhodesia, that became Zambia. ""Her experience growing up, and her family's experience growing up, was not like the experience of Wales in the 19th and 20th Century,"" he said. Mr Price said he found it insensitive to suggest or create the impression that he was a racist, and ""we need to park these personal insults and let's talk about the issues"". A Plaid spokesperson added that the Labour Party in Wales had been ""failing to deliver on the economy, healthcare and education - all things under their control"" . ""Labour should really be spending more time trying to fix the position Wales finds itself in,"" the spokesperson said. ""The fact that a third of our children living in poverty is a direct result of the kind of economy we have which has extracted from Wales without allowing our nation to benefit, with power centralised outside our own country.""

"Rev Richard Cameron accused Jeremy Corbyn of being a ""terrorist sympathiser"" The minister who heckled Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn in Glasgow has been suspended while an investigation into controversial tweets is carried out. Rev Richard Cameronshouted at Mr Corbyn as he entered a community centreon Wednesday. It later emerged that he had made Islamophobic and homophobic comments on social media. The Church of Scotland has confirmed he will not be allowed to work as a minister while inquiries continue. A spokeswoman for the church said: ""In accordance with our procedures Rev Richard Cameron has been administratively suspended. ""This is to allow us to carry out an inquiry in relation to the incident which took place earlier this week and the subsequent complaints about his social media use."" In one tweet Rev Cameron, the minister at Scotstoun Parish Church in Glasgow, compared homosexuality to incest, describing them as ""unnatural"". ""Both cause harm by breaking sensibly held taboos,"" he added. In September, he tweeted: ""Christ has the power to help and change anyone. Obviously many gays hate this because want to carry on their perversion."" He also shared a series of controversial views on Islam, describing terrorism as ""a problem Islam needs to deal with"", a full face veil as ""oppressive and unBritish"" and the Prophet Muhammad as ""a violent man"". In another post, he said: ""The best way to defeat Islam is to preach Christ"". When initially alerted to the tweets, the church said it ""deplored comments which were Islamophobic or homophobic"". Rev Cameron, who worked in pharmaceutical sales before joining the church, has been minister at Scotstoun since 2000.

"This video can not be played Labour's John McDonnell pledged ""free broadband for the country"" if the party gets elected Labour has promised to give every home and business in the UK free full-fibre broadband by 2030, if it wins the general election. The party would nationalise part of BT to deliver the policy and introduce a tax on tech giants to help pay for it. Shadow chancellor John McDonnell told the BBC the ""visionary"" Â£20bn plan would ""ensure that broadband reaches the whole of the country"". But Prime Minister Boris Johnson said it was ""a crackpot scheme"". The plan includes nationalising parts of BT - namely its digital network arm Openreach - to create a UK-wide network owned by the government. Mr McDonnell said the roll-out would begin with communities that have the worst broadband access, followed by towns and smaller centres, and then by areas that are currently well served. LIVE: Latest from the election campaign trail Will fibre broadband be obsolete by 2030? Conservatives' Â£5bn plan for full fibre - does it add up? A really simple guide to the UK general election What are nationalisation and privatisation? A Labour government would compensate shareholders by issuing government bonds. The shadow chancellor said Labour had taken legal advice, including ensuring pension funds with investments in BT are not left out of pocket. As with other planned Labour nationalisations, he said MPs would set the value of the company at the time of it being taken into public ownership. Mr McDonnell told the BBC's Laura Kuenssberg that Labour would add an extra Â£15bn to the government's existing Â£5bn broadband strategy, with the money to come from the party's proposed Green Transformation Fund. Having already announced plans to nationalise water, rail and now broadband, Mr McDonnell said this latest plan was ""the limit of our ambitions"". A new entity, British Broadband, would run the network, with maintenance - estimated to cost Â£230m a year - to be covered by the new tax on companies such as Apple and Google. ""We think they should pay their way and other countries are following suit,"" said Mr McDonnell. Labour has not yet completed the final details of how the internet giant tax would work, saying it would be based ""percentage wise'' on global profits and UK sales, raising potentially as much as Â£6bn. Mr McDonnell said that if other broadband providers did not want to give access to British Broadband, then they would also be taken into public ownership. Labour has costed its policy from a report produced byFrontier Economics in 2018,external, which was originally produced for the Department of Digital, Culture Media and Sport. Broadband packages in the UK cost households an average of around Â£30 a month, according to comparison site Cable - which people would no longer have to pay under Labour's scheme. The party claims it would ""literally eliminate bills for millions of people across the UK"". According to a report from regulator Ofcom earlier this year, only 7% of the UK has access to full-fibre broadband. The government hit its target to bring superfast broadband to 95% of homes by December 2017 - at a cost of Â£1.7bn - but the internet speeds are significantly lower than those of full-fibre. This video can not be played The BBC's Helen Catt looks at the main events of Thursday's election campaign. BT chief executive Philip Jansen told BBC Radio 4's Today programme Labour had under-estimated the price of its pledge. But he said he was happy to work with whoever wins the election to help build a digital Britain, although the process for implementing Labour's plan would not be ""straightforward"". He added that the impact of any changes on BT pensioners, employees, shareholders - and the millions of investors via pension schemes - needed to be carefully thought through. The company has disputed the cost of rolling out fibre broadband to every home and business, saying it would cost closer to Â£40bn than Â£20bn.

"This video can not be played Labour's John McDonnell pledged ""free broadband for the country"" if the party gets elected Labour has promised to give every home and business in the UK free full-fibre broadband by 2030, if it wins the general election. The party would nationalise part of BT to deliver the policy and introduce a tax on tech giants to help pay for it. Shadow chancellor John McDonnell told the BBC the ""visionary"" Â£20bn plan would ""ensure that broadband reaches the whole of the country"". But Prime Minister Boris Johnson said it was ""a crackpot scheme"". The plan includes nationalising parts of BT - namely its digital network arm Openreach - to create a UK-wide network owned by the government. Mr McDonnell said the roll-out would begin with communities that have the worst broadband access, followed by towns and smaller centres, and then by areas that are currently well served. LIVE: Latest from the election campaign trail Will fibre broadband be obsolete by 2030? Conservatives' Â£5bn plan for full fibre - does it add up? A really simple guide to the UK general election What are nationalisation and privatisation? A Labour government would compensate shareholders by issuing government bonds. The shadow chancellor said Labour had taken legal advice, including ensuring pension funds with investments in BT are not left out of pocket. As with other planned Labour nationalisations, he said MPs would set the value of the company at the time of it being taken into public ownership. Mr McDonnell told the BBC's Laura Kuenssberg that Labour would add an extra Â£15bn to the government's existing Â£5bn broadband strategy, with the money to come from the party's proposed Green Transformation Fund. Having already announced plans to nationalise water, rail and now broadband, Mr McDonnell said this latest plan was ""the limit of our ambitions"". A new entity, British Broadband, would run the network, with maintenance - estimated to cost Â£230m a year - to be covered by the new tax on companies such as Apple and Google. ""We think they should pay their way and other countries are following suit,"" said Mr McDonnell. Labour has not yet completed the final details of how the internet giant tax would work, saying it would be based ""percentage wise'' on global profits and UK sales, raising potentially as much as Â£6bn. Mr McDonnell said that if other broadband providers did not want to give access to British Broadband, then they would also be taken into public ownership. Labour has costed its policy from a report produced byFrontier Economics in 2018,external, which was originally produced for the Department of Digital, Culture Media and Sport. Broadband packages in the UK cost households an average of around Â£30 a month, according to comparison site Cable - which people would no longer have to pay under Labour's scheme. The party claims it would ""literally eliminate bills for millions of people across the UK"". According to a report from regulator Ofcom earlier this year, only 7% of the UK has access to full-fibre broadband. The government hit its target to bring superfast broadband to 95% of homes by December 2017 - at a cost of Â£1.7bn - but the internet speeds are significantly lower than those of full-fibre. This video can not be played The BBC's Helen Catt looks at the main events of Thursday's election campaign. BT chief executive Philip Jansen told BBC Radio 4's Today programme Labour had under-estimated the price of its pledge. But he said he was happy to work with whoever wins the election to help build a digital Britain, although the process for implementing Labour's plan would not be ""straightforward"". He added that the impact of any changes on BT pensioners, employees, shareholders - and the millions of investors via pension schemes - needed to be carefully thought through.

Mr Trump will also attend a reception at Buckingham Palace, which will be hosted by the Queen. The president has previously been criticised forvoicing his opinions of British political leaders, including Boris Johnsonand Jeremy Corbyn. The White House said in a statement that the president ""looks forward to meeting"" the other Nato leaders and would ""emphasize the need for the Nato alliance to ensure its readiness for the threats of tomorrow"". These threats include ""those emanating from cyberspace, those affecting our critical infrastructure and telecommunications networks, and those posed by terrorism,"" the statement said. It said the leaders would ""review the alliance's unprecedented progress on burden-sharing, including adding more than $100bn (Â£76bn) in new defence spending since 2016."" In October the president criticised Mr Johnson's Brexit deal with the EU, saying it restricted the US's ability to do future trade with the UK. Speaking to the Brexit Party leader, Nigel Farage, on LBC, he said that without the deal the two countries could ""do many times the numbers"" than now.

"A worker applying a capping layer to a landfill site in Hangzhou China's largest dump is already full - 25 years ahead of schedule. The Jiangcungou landfill in Shaanxi Province, which is the size of around 100 football fields, was designed to take 2,500 tonnes of rubbish per day. But instead it received 10,000 tonnes of waste per day - the most of any landfill site in China. China is one of the world's biggest polluters, and has been struggling for years with the rubbish its 1.4 billion citizens generate. The Jiangcungou landfill in Xi'an city was built in 1994 and was designed to last until 2044. The landfill serves over 8 million citizens. It spans an area of almost 700,000 square metres, with a depth of 150 metres and a storage capacity of more than 34 million cubic metres. Until recently, Xi'an was one of the few cities in China that solely relied on landfill to dispose of household waste - leading to capacity being reached early. Earlier this month, a new incineration plant was opened, and at least four more are expected to open by 2020. Together, they are expected to be able to process 12,750 tonnes of rubbish per day. The move is part of a national plan to reduce the number of landfills, and instead use other waste disposal methods like incineration. The landfill site in Xi'an will eventually become an ""ecological park"". In 2017, China collected215 million tonnes of urban household waste,external, according to the country's statistical yearbook. That's up from 152 millionten years earlier.,external The country had 654 landfill sites and 286 incineration plants. It is not clear what China's recycling rate is, as no figures have been released. China plans to recycle 35% of waste in major cities by the end of 2020, according toone government report.,external This July, sorting and recycling rubbish was made mandatory in Shanghai - leading to""a sense of panic""among some residents. Social angst high as Shanghai gets tough on rubbish A blockage in global waste disposal In 2015, there was a landslide at a rubbish dump in the southern city of Shenzhen,killing 73 people. The dump was designed to hold four million cubic metres worth of rubbish, with a maximum height of 95 metres. When it collapsed, it was holding 5.8m cubic metres of material with waste heaps up to 160m high. One town in Malaysia was left swamped with foreign waste Not anymore. It used to, until the end of 2017 when it decided to ban the import of 24different grades of rubbish. In 2017 alone, China took in seven million tonnes of plastic rubbish from Europe, Japan and the US - and 27 million tonnes of waste paper. Other countries, including Malaysia, Turkey, the Philippines and Indonesia, have picked up some of the slack. Who's sending back plastic waste? The small town with a dirty secret Reality Check: Where is the plastic waste mountain? But they struggled to deal with the amount of waste coming in - often times resulting in massive, out-of-control landfills in their own countries. Some of these countries have now banned the import of certain types of rubbish and are even sending it back.

"Mr Muir said plastic pollution on Jura had been getting worse over the last few years A stag died after becoming entangled in plastic tape on a Scottish island. It is feared the animal was trapped in the discarded strapping for a week before he was discovered on Jura in the Inner Hebrides. Gamekeeper Scott Muir, 32, found him struggling on an island hillside on Wednesday. He believes the stag went without food for about a week as his mouth was jammed closed by the debris. The animal had to be put down. Mr Muir said the stag was likely to have got his antler caught in the plastic while grazing on seaweed on the coastline. He believed the stag then walked for about a mile on to the hillside before reaching his final resting point. Mr Muir said: ""I was walking over the estate when I saw the plastic waste and realised there was a stag caught. ""I thought it was dead at first but as I approached it I could see his head start to move. ""These can be 18st animals and I know how powerful they can be, but he looked tired and stressed and he couldn't see because the plastic was right around his antlers"". Stags on Rum found tangled in discarded fishing gear Attempt to save deer trapped in creel frame on Rum Endangered red squirrel dies trapped in plastic jar Mr Muir is a volunteer for Wild Side of Jura, a group which aims to protect the west coast of the island. He said the plastic pollution on the island had been getting worse over the last six years and believed commercial fishing was probably responsible. The picture was posted on social media and local residents expressed their anger. One resident said: ""That's shocking, poor animal, the thought of him struggling with that for hours makes me so angry. ""So much plastic out there, it makes it much more of a reality when you see the damage it does so close to home"".

"The UK is gearing up to hold a general election on Thursday. These national votes, to choose a government to run the country, are supposed to be held every five years. But this would be the third since 2015. A total of 650 people will be chosen asmembers of Parliament (MPs), to decide laws and policies. Members of Parliament are elected by voters to represent the interests of their constituency in the House of Commons. Most belong to a political party, but some do stand as independents. There are 650 MPs in the House. MPs are elected to the House of Commons, one of two chambers of Parliament in London, where the government is based. The government passes laws that help it run the country. This compares with local governments which deal with issues such as bin collections and schools in each area. In a general election, the UK's 46 million voters are invited to choose an MP for their area - one of 650 constituencies. Anyone aged 18 or over can vote, as long as they are registered and a British citizen or qualifying citizen of the Commonwealth or Republic of Ireland. Older people are more likely than younger ones to vote. At the 2017 general election, 59% of 20- to 24-year-olds voted, compared with 77% of 60- to 69-year-olds. However, about two-thirds of the more than 3.1 million people who registered to vote between the election being called and the registration deadline were under the age of 35, with more than a million of them under 25. Voting takes place at local polling stations, set up in places such as churches and school halls. Voters put a cross on the ballot paper beside the name of their chosen candidate and drop it into a sealed ballot box. Most people over 18 on polling day can stand as a candidate - as long as they are a British citizen or a qualifying Commonwealth or Republic of Ireland citizen resident in the UK. They must also pay a Â£500 deposit, which will be lost if they do not get at least 5% of the votes in their constituency. Candidates must meet certain conditions - prisoners, civil servants, judges and members of the police and armed forces cannot stand. A total of 3,322 candidates are standing across the 650 seats this year. There are 91 Davids standing for election - the most popular name among the candidates - while the first female name on the list is Sarah in 18th place. There are 22 candidates with that first name standing. The candidate with the most votes in each constituency is elected, even if they are chosen by less than half the electorate in their seat. Most MPs represent a political party but some stand for election as independent candidates. Any party with more than half the MPs (326) in the Commons usually forms the government. Parties with well below 50% of the national vote can take power as a result of theUK's voting system. The UK uses a first past the post voting system. It means a local candidate who receives the most votes wins â and the party with the most winning candidates forms a government. So the overall number of votes parties get nationally does not have any bearing on who wins the election. If no party has a majority of MPs, the one with the most can form a coalition - or partnership - with one or more other parties to gain control. The prime minister is not directly voted for by the public. He or she is chosen by the winning party's MPs and appointed bythe Queen, who is duty bound to follow their advice. The Queen is the UKâs head of state, although she is not in charge of the government. Elizabeth II is the countryâs longest-serving monarch, having ascended to the throne in 1952. She performs state duties, which include formally opening Parliament, representing the country at events such as the annual Remembrance Day parade, and making official visits overseas. She is also head of the armed forces and Church of England. Detailed proposals for everything from the economy to defence and policing are set out before any general election inmanifestos. A manifesto is basically a brochure containing all of a party's ideas and policies. Manifestos are usually published during the general election campaign. If a party wins the election, it is often judged by how many of its manifesto promises it manages to deliver as a government. These come from the UK's political parties - groups of people with similar political beliefs who come together to try to win power. The issues UK voters care most about have changed a lot, according to the polls. TheNational Health Service (NHS)and immigration were the things that most concerned voters in 2015. The National Health Service (NHS), which started in 1948, is the government-funded national healthcare service that provides free diagnosis and treatment for UK citizens. TheEuropean Union (EU)was of far less interest. European Union: the political and economic union of 28 member states, which the UK is planning to leave. Now, however,Brexit- the UK's departure from the EU - is a huge issue. Short for British exit - refers to the UK leaving the European Union. Neither the Conservative orLabourparties had enough votes to form a majority government after the 2017 election. The Labour Party was founded by the trade union movement in 1900 to give workers a voice in Parliament. It believes in the redistribution of wealth and opportunity, greater rights for working people and strong, state-run public services. The Conservatives were the bigger of the two parties and formed a partnership with the Democratic Unionist PartyDUPin order to win votes in the Commons. The Democratic Unionist Party was founded in 1971, during the time of conflict in Northern Ireland, known as the Troubles. As unionists, the DUP support Northern Ireland being part of the UK and are known for their socially conservative beliefs on abortion and same-sex marriage. After the 2017 election, DUP MPs helped keep the Conservatives in power by agreeing to support them in Commons votes. Since the election, the Conservatives and Labour have both lost MPs, while theLiberal Democratshave made gains. Often called the Lib Dems, the Liberal Democrats were formed in 1988 by the merger of one of Britain's oldest political institutions, the Liberal Party, which stood for free trade and individual liberty, and the Social Democratic Party, a centrist offshoot of the Labour Party. The party likes to see itself as being on the centre ground of British politics. Parliament's second chamber is theHouse of Lords. The House of Lords is the second chamber of the UK Parliament. It is independent from the House of Commons but shares with it the role of making laws, while it also checks the governmentâs work. Members are given a title, such as Lord, are not elected, do not represent constituencies and most do not belong to any party. Its members are not elected but are appointed by the Queen, on the prime minister's advice. On general election day, voting takes place between 07:00 and 22:00. The results are declared through the night and the following day. When the overall result is known, the leader of the winning party, if there is one, visits Buckingham Palace to ask the Queen for permission to form a new government. Once they have that, which is a formality, they return to the traditional home of the prime minister10 Downing Street. This terraced house is the official residence and office of the UK prime minister. Often they will stand outside to deliver a speech about their party's plans for the coming years.

"Boris Johnson has claimed there will be no border in the Irish Sea as a result of his Brexit deal. Under the deal NI will continue to follow many EU rules on food and manufactured goods, while the rest of the UK will not. NI will also continue to follow EU customs rules but will remain part of the UK's customs territory. A government risk assessment says that will lead tonew administration and checks on goods entering NI from GB. No checks on goods between NI and GB, says PM 'Minimal' checks needed on NI-GB trade movements Those new processes and checks are widely interpreted as amounting to ""an Irish Sea border."" Mr Johnson was taking part in a BBC phone in and was questioned by a caller from Belfast. He told her there would be no checks on any goods from NI to the rest of the UK. He was asked if he could commit that NI businesses would not encounter additional paperwork or fees when dealing with GB. He said: ""I absolutely can. This is a matter for the UK government and we will make sure that businesses face no extra costs and no checks for stuff being exported from NI to GB."" However Mr Johnson gave no commitments on what would happen with GB to NI trade. 'Loyalist disorder' warning if Brexit threatens union Brexit deal 'could reduce investment in NI' Why ministers won't release Brexit forecast Under his deal means Northern Ireland will remain part of a ""single regulatory zone"" with the Republic of Ireland, a zone that will apply EU rules. The EU has particularly strict rules on the importation of ""products of animal origin"" - meat, fish and dairy products. Those products must enter the EU through a border inspection post where all shipments are subject to document checks and a high proportion are physically checked. Products of animal origin from Great Britain entering Northern Ireland would be subject to these checks. This video can not be played ""There will not be checks on goods going from NI to GB,"" Boris Johnson tells Conservative supporters A few countries, such as New Zealand, have a deal with the EU where only 1% of consignments are checked. It is possible that the UK could negotiate a similar deal but it would not be able to eliminate checks entirely unless the whole of the UK was going to stay in the single market. The current political declaration, which sets out the broad shape of the future EU-UK relationship, suggests that is unlikely. Mr Johnson said that if the deal was found not to be working for the people of Northern Ireland thenthe Stormont Assembly can vote to leave that regulatory zone. The caller pointed out that Stormont has not sat for over 1,000 days - Mr Johnson said this was 'a great shame.'

Boris Johnson unveiled his campaign bus in Manchester Mr Farage meeting voters in Nottinghamshire Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage says one of his MEPs deliberately sabotaged any chance of fielding a candidate in a West Midlands constituency. He accuses Rupert Lowe of ""disgusting behaviour"" in withdrawing his nomination for the seat moments before the deadline, when no replacement could be found. Mr Loweannounced his withdrawal on Twitter,externalone minute before the nomination deadline for candidates yesterday, saying he did not want to split the pro-Brexit vote and let in Labour. Mr Farage apologises to party supporters in the constituency. ""I'm sorry - we have been double-crossed, let down badly by a man who has behaved dishonestly,"" he says. He has previously accused Conservatives of offering peerages and other inducements to his candidates in other constituencies to persuade them not to run.But the Tories have denied this. Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesman Ed Davey is accusing Labour and the Conservatives of spending plans that are ""fantasies"". In a speech in Yorkshire, he tells party supporters: ""Boris Johnson has snuck into Jeremy Cobynâs allotment and stolen his magic money tree."" Mr Davey promises to make sure Britain's budget is balanced throughout a Lib Dem government. But he also pledges Â£100bn of investment in reducing carbon emissions, Â£120bn on well-being and mental health, and Â£130bn for infrastructure. And he says the party would restore ""Britain's best trade agreement ever"" - membership of the EU. Labour and the Tories will struggle to deliver their spending plans after Brexit because it will be difficult to attract construction workers, he suggests. He also criticises Labour's plans to nationalise broadband and offer it free at the point of use. ""We won't put Big Brother in charge of your broadband,"" he says.   Earlier, the PM told BBC's 5 Live that the assertion his children have never been to state school ""was wrong"" but declined to say how many children he has.

Did you know Parliament has an official election artist? For the 12 December poll it's been revealed Nicky Hirst will take on the task. The London-based artist will produce a piece of work inspired by observations she makes during the campaign. The artwork will join the Parliamentary Art Collection, which documents and illustrates the history of Parliament over the centuries. Ms Hirst says taking on the role was ""an honour"". Her art is described as often taking something intangible and making it concrete and visible - such as the below examples. ""Being
the election artist is a rare opportunity to come to the campaign with an open
mind to observe and document what candidates are saying,"" Ms Hirst says. ""I want
to be as honest and transparent as possible about what I see as I immerse
myself in this world."" Confused by the latest election developments? Got a question

childcare and family benefits and finances, like this one from Andy Barnard in Maidenhead: Q - Does the year's maternity pay also
apply to fathers? A - Statutory maternity pay (SMP) is paid
for 39 weeks. For the first six weeks it is paid at 90% of their average weekly
earnings before tax. The following 33 weeks is paid at at Â£148.68 per week or
90% of their average weekly earnings, whichever is the lower. But some employers offer maternity pay that
is more than the statutory rate. Shared parental leave allows parents -
after birth or adoption - to share up to 50 weeks of leave and up to 37 weeks
of pay between them. Paternity leave is a period of either one or two
consecutive weeks that fathers or partners can take off from work to care for
their baby or child. The father or partner can receive statutory paternity pay
of Â£148.68 per week, provided they have worked for their company for 26 weeks. You

Rory Cellan-JonesTechnology correspondent Labour has said building the British Broadband network will cost Â£20 billion and once completed running costs will amount to Â£230 million per year. A source at BT has pointed out that Openreach has 33,000 employees and shadow chancellor John McDonnell has guaranteed that none will lose their jobs. The source says that operational expenses figure equates to a salary of less than Â£7,000 per employee. Boris Johnson has put his address as 11, not 10, Downing
Streetin a statement of candidates for the Uxbridge and South Ruislip constituency.,external Thatâs because he lives in the larger flat above 11 Downing
Street, while Chancellor Sajid Javid lives in the smaller No 10 flat. When Theresa May and David Cameron went to the polls as prime minister, they each listed their constituency homes as their addresses. Mr Johnson does not have an address in Uxbridge. Hillary Clinton pictured in London while promoting her book earlier this week Hillary Clinton has criticised the ""heavily misogynistic"" atmosphere online which has seen female parliamentary candidates announce they are not standing in the general election. The former US secretary of state highlighted the ""intimidation"" faced by female politicians at a panel discussion at Swansea University. Mrs Clinton - whose grandparents were Welsh - said: ""Unfortunately, the atmosphere online is heavily misogynistic because apparently the people, and it's predominantly, though not exclusively, men who spend their time going after women of prominence in whatever field they are in and just can't let it go.
"" ""What they say is often vile, and when I was in London over the last few days, a number of people told me about women not standing for Parliament this time because of the threats they have received. ""And it's really particular to them. Threats of death and terrible attacks, including going after their families, in particular mentioning their children."" The former US presidential candidate said she had met with an unnamed female politician who decided not to stand in the 12 December election because, Mrs Clinton was told, ""I just can't take it"". Here's our piece from last month about women MPs saying abuse forced them from politics. Mrs Clinton said: ""It is a terrible loss and a loss to democracy if anybody is intimidated out of running, and disproportionately the people choosing not to run in the first instance or for re-election are women."" Mrs Clinton led the panel entitled Gutsy Welsh Women - a nod to her new book, co-authored with her daughter Chelsea - alongside senior education figures in Wales. Boris Johnson on a visit to Coronation Candy in Blackpool Jeremy Corbyn holds up a painting given to him by a local artist during a speech in Morecambe Earlier today when answering questions from the public, the prime minister said that the Tories would invest Â£500m to reverse the cuts to railway lines and stations made in the 1960s. More than 5,000 miles of track and nearly 1,500 stations closed between 1964 and 1970, after a report by British Railways chairman Richard Beeching. But rail experts say that the money is not enough to restore services to all the places cut off by those cuts. ""It is not going to buy you very much railway. A rebuilt railway costs millions for each kilometre,"" says Sim Harris, managing editor of industry newspaper Railnews. ""It would cost far more than that to really reverse Beeching."" The Conservatives say that among the possible locations for new or reopened lines are Ashington, Seaton Delaval and Blyth in Northumberland; Skelmersdale in Lancashire; Thornton-Cleveleys and Fleetwood in Lancashire; and Willenhall and Darlaston in the West Midlands. But the party has not provided any more details on how it would fund a reversal of the Beeching cuts.

Reality Check Prime Minister Boris Johnson took questions from the public in a phone-in broadcast on 5 Live and the BBC News Channel earlier today.

The plan would see millions more properties given access to a full-fibre connection, though Prime Minister Boris Johnson said it was ""a crackpot scheme"". But if the plan went ahead and was completed on time, would it still be useful in 2030?Read our full story here. One of the comparisons that shadow chancellor John McDonnell made in setting out his plans for part-nationalising BT to provide free fibre optic broadband was with South Korea. Mr McDonnell said the country has 98% coverage with full-fibre broadband, compared to 8% to 10% in the UK. But BBC economics editor Faisal Islam says the comparison doesn't completely stand up. While South Korea has state involvement in planning and coordinating the building of fibre infrastructure, it isn't run by state-owned companies. Instead, it is mostly privately funded in a ""super-competitive market"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"Jean Fergusson, who played Marina in Last of the Summer Wine for 25 years, has died at the age of 74. Fergusson played the opinionated Marina in 216 episodes of the show from 1985. She also appeared several times in ITV soap Coronation Street, most recently playing the part of Dorothy Hoyle until 2011. She also had a theatre career and was nominated for an Olivier award in 1998 for playing British comic, actress and music hall performer Hylda Baker. The actress's death comes afterthat of her former Last of the Summer Wine colleague Juliette Kaplanin October. Fergusson did many scenes with Robert Fyfe in Last of the Summer Wine Comedy actress Vicki Michelle, best known for 'Allo 'Allo, paid tribute to Fergusson. Allow Twitter content?

Fergusson was born on 30 December 1944, and grew up in the village of Woolley near Wakefield. ""I have very fond memories of a happy childhood, and going to the village school - long closed now, of course,"" she said in 2009. ""We'd stretch a line across the road and make that into our 'tennis net'. There was so little traffic back then that we rarely had to take it down."" The family later moved to Wales, where Fergusson learned her acting craft at The Castle (the Royal Welsh College of Music and Drama). Before getting the role of Marina in Last of the Summer Wine, Fergusson had forged a successful career in theatre and was rarely out of work. Her first job at the Oldham Coliseum lasted two years and saw her in a variety of roles and touring productions around the UK. Fergusson also appeared in several television shows, including All Creatures Great & Small, Crossroads and The Practice, before taking on the role that would define her for the next two decades. The Very Last of the Summer Wine Jean Fergusson played Dorothy Hoyle in Coronation Street Set in West Yorkshire, Last of the Summer Wine, which began in 1973 and ended in 2010, soon became the nation's favourite comedy. At its peak it was watched by 18 million people. Its success came from the seemingly incongruous mix of madcap capers carried out by a group of young at-heart pensioners. Fergusson's casting as the mini-skirt wearing, peroxide blonde Marina, was in fact first performed in a stage version of the show. The character was such a hit that TV director Roy Clarke decided to incorporate Marina - along with the characters of Howard and Pearl - into his television series. Hapless Howard was the love of Marina's life and the pair would travel up hill and down dale on their bikes or scooter, when Howard managed to find time away from his domineering wife Pearl. Marina's outfits were characteristically skimpy and as Fergusson grew older, she admitted to having become less and less comfortable, in more ways than one. ""Funnily enough more towards the end [of the series], I was always the one in the low-cut blouse and the mini skirt or the shorts,"" she said when appearing on quiz show Pointless Celebrities in 2017. ""When I got - shall we say - a little bit older, it wasn't quite the same getting all dressed up in the morning in a pair of little mini shorts and a very low-cut blouse. ""But we battled through. We got on the bike and off we went."" While making Last of the Summer Wine in the 1990s, Fergusson was researching and writing the one-woman show She Knows, You Know! about the life and  decline of Hylda Baker. Fergusson was in the comedy play Two Into One at the Menier Theatre in London in 2014 Fergusson had admired Baker since her childhood and when she took the show to London's West End stage she found herself receiving the Olivier nomination for best entertainment show. Fergusson's first foray into Coronation Street came whilst she was still making Last of the Summer Wine. In 1999, she arrived to play the role of Mrs Mallett. She later returned to the soap after the end of Last of the Summer Wine to play Dorothy Hoyle from 2010 to 2011. In 2014, Fergusson sold off the bike she was given from Last of the Summer Wine, when she moved from Yorkshire to London and realised she had no space for it. It made Â£500 at auction. ""If I could have kept it, I would have done,"" said Fergusson, ""but I'll let some wonderful fan have the pleasure of it.""

"Mr Muir said plastic pollution on Jura had been getting worse over the last few years A stag died after becoming entangled in plastic tape on a Scottish island. It is feared the animal was trapped in the discarded strapping for a week before he was discovered on Jura in the Inner Hebrides. Gamekeeper Scott Muir, 32, found him struggling on an island hillside on Wednesday. He believes the stag went without food for about a week as his mouth was jammed closed by the debris. The animal had to be put down. Mr Muir said the stag was likely to have got his antler caught in the plastic while grazing on seaweed on the coastline. He believed the stag then walked for about a mile on to the hillside before reaching his final resting point. Mr Muir said: ""I was walking over the estate when I saw the plastic waste and realised there was a stag caught. ""I thought it was dead at first but as I approached it I could see his head start to move. ""These can be 18st animals and I know how powerful they can be, but he looked tired and stressed and he couldn't see because the plastic was right around his antlers"". Stags on Rum found tangled in discarded fishing gear Attempt to save deer trapped in creel frame on Rum Endangered red squirrel dies trapped in plastic jar Mr Muir is a volunteer for Wild Side of Jura, a group which aims to protect the west coast of the island. He said the plastic pollution on the island had been getting worse over the last six years and believed commercial fishing was probably responsible. The picture was posted on social media and local residents expressed their anger. One resident said: ""That's shocking, poor animal, the thought of him struggling with that for hours makes me so angry. ""So much plastic out there, it makes it much more of a reality when you see the damage it does so close to home"".

"Taylor Swift is in a dispute with Scooter Braun (centre) and Scott Borchetta Taylor Swift's former record label has rebuffed her claims it is blocking her from performing her own hits at the forthcoming American Music Awards. The singer said music executives Scooter Braun and Scott Borchetta would not let her perform songs from her past albums, which they own the rights to. She said a Netflix documentary about her life had also been put in jeopardy. Borchetta and Braun's Big Machine Records said Swift's statement was ""based on false information"". Swift v Braun: Personal or strictly business? Taylor Swift 'bullied' by man who now owns her music Swift made the allegations in a statement posted to Twitter with the caption: ""Don't know what else to do."" Allow Twitter content?

""Right now my performance at the AMAs, the Netflix documentary and any other recorded events I am planning to play until November 2020 are a question mark,"" she wrote. But in response, the label denied telling the pop superstar she could not perform at the AMAs or trying to block the Netflix special, and said the ""narrative you have created does not exist"". Swift is being named Artist of the Decade at this month's AMAs In June, Swift revealed thatthe masters of her early music had been sold to Braun by her former record label, run by Borchetta, and alleged that she was not told about it. At the time the singer accused Braun, who also manages Ariana Grande, Justin Bieber and Demi Lovato, of ""incessant, manipulative bullying"". Swift also accused Braun of attempting to ""dismantle"" her ""musical legacy"".,externalWhile he did not respond to her comments, he was supported by Lovato and Bieber, who claimed Swift was just out ""to get sympathy"". The singer confirmed in August that she planned to re-record music from her first six albums so she could own the rights to the new versions. Swift is set to be named Artist of the Decade at the AMAs later this month and said she had been planning to perform a medley of her hits. But in her statement on Thursday, she said the two men had blocked her from performing her old songs on television, claiming that this would be re-recording her music before she is allowed to next year. They also blocked the use of her older music or performance footage in the upcoming Netflix film, she claimed. Swift alleged that Borchetta told her team she would only be allowed to use the music if she agreed ""not to re-record copycat versions"" next year and stopped talking about the two men. ""The message being sent to me is very clear. Basically, be a good little girl and shut up. Or you'll be punished,"" she wrote. She went on to ask her fans to help to pressure Braun and Borchetta into changing their minds and to appeal to the artists they manage for help. She also asked for help from the private equity firm The Carlyle Group, which she said financed the sale. Fans responded instantly, with the hashtags ""IStandWithTaylor"" and ""FreeTaylor"" trending on Twitter. Ina statement,external, the Big Machine Label Group said it had been optimistic about resolving the long-running dispute - until Swift posted her statement on Thursday. ""Despite our persistent efforts to find a private and mutually satisfactory solution, Taylor made a unilateral decision last night to enlist her fanbase in a calculated manner that greatly affects the safety of our employees and their families,"" the label said. In June, Scooter Braun (right) bought Big Machine, which Borchetta founded in 2005 ""Taylor, the narrative you have created does not exist. All we ask is to have a direct and honest conversation. When that happens, you will see there is nothing but respect, kindness and support waiting for you on the other side."" Big Machine also said: ""At no point did we say Taylor could not perform on the AMAs or block her Netflix special. In fact, we do not have the right to keep her from performing live anywhere."" It did not specifically address whether she could perform old songs. In response,the singer's publicist Tree Paine insisted,externalthat Borchetta ""flatly denied the request for both American Music Awards and Netflix"". Both sides also claim the other owes them millions of dollars. Borchetta founded Big Machine in 2005, and the company was bought by Braun's Ithaca Holdings in June. Stars including Halsey, Gigi Hadid and BBC Radio 1 DJ Greg James have leapt to the singer's defence. Fellow pop singer Halsey said: ""These people are protected because they inspire complicity with fear. ""Banking on the illusion that people will not stand up for her. That the world will say she is over-reacting, You're barking up the wrong tree. ""It is her grace and patience in these moments that make her artist of the decade,"" she added.

After Braun bought most of the US pop star's life's work, thanks to his acquisition of her former record label Big Machine for $300m (Â£237m) in June, Tim Ingham from Music Business Worldwidetold the BBCin July that these kind of contract arrangements were fairly common in the days before music streaming. ""Unfortunately for Taylor Swift, she started recording at a time in the history of the industry when it was still heavily reliant on radio, where you needed a record company backing to get you on radio, particularly country radio in Nashville, where Big Machine was a huge player,"" said Ingham. ""And also, you needed to rely on physical distribution to get your CDs into stores. So she needed a record company to invest the amount of money that they had to invest to get her career off the ground."" Mark Sutherland, editor of trade publication Music Week, agreed in July with Ingham that Braun's business decisions will most likely be driven by money.

"This video can not be played Prince Andrew: ""I let the side down, simple as that"" The Duke of York has said he ""let the side down"" by staying at the home of convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, adding it was the ""wrong thing to do"". Answering questions about his links to Epstein for the first time, Prince Andrew said his stay was not ""becoming of a member of the Royal Family"". The prince spoke to BBC Newsnight's Emily Maitlis in an interview recorded at Buckingham Palace on Thursday. It will be broadcast onBBC Two at 21:00 GMT on Saturday. Explained: Who was Jeffrey Epstein? Timeline: Prince Andrew's links to Epstein Prince Andrew, who is the Queen's third child, has been facing questions for several months over his ties to Epstein, a 66-year-old American financier who took his own life while awaiting trial on sex-trafficking charges. In 2010, the prince was photographed walking with Epstein in New York's Central Park -two years after Epstein's convictionfor soliciting a minor for prostitution. Footagepublished by the Mail on Sunday,externalshowed the prince in Epstein's Manhattan mansion at about the same time. Addressing his decision to stay with Epstein following the American's first conviction, Prince Andrew said: ""That's the bit thatâ¦ as it were, I kick myself for on a daily basis because it was not something that was becoming of a member of the Royal Family and we try and uphold the highest standards and practices and I let the side down, simple as that."" Challenged on his decision to stay at the home of a convicted sex offender, the prince said: ""It was a convenient place to stay. ""I mean I've gone through this in my mind so many times. At the end of the day, with a benefit of all the hindsight that one can have, it was definitely the wrong thing to do. ""But at the time I felt it was the honourable and right thing to do and I admit fully that my judgement was probably coloured by my tendency to be too honourable but that's just the way it is."" Prince Andrew and Jeffrey Epstein go for a stroll together through New York's Central Park In 2015, Prince Andrew was named in court papers as part of a US civil case against Epstein. One of Epstein's accusers, Virginia Roberts - now Virginia Giuffre - said she was forced to have sex with the prince three times between 2001 - when she was 17 - and 2002, in London, New York and on a private Caribbean island owned by Epstein. This video can not be played Virginia Giuffre: Prince Andrew ""knows exactly what he's done"" In the BBC interview, Emily Maitlis asks the prince about Ms Giuffre's claims that in 2001, she had dined with him, danced with him at a nightclub, and went on to have sex with him at the house of a friend of the prince in Belgravia, central London. The prince replied: ""It didn't happen. I have no recollection of ever meeting this lady, none whatsoever."" When asked once more whether he remembered meeting Ms Giuffre, the prince said: ""No."" Ms Giuffre says she was abused by the prince in Ghislaine Maxwell's London home, where she was pictured in 2001 Details of Ms Giuffre's claims against the prince were later officially struck from court records when a judge ruled they were unnecessary to the case, saying they were ""immaterial and impertinent"" to the ""central claim"". Separately, a woman called Johanna Sjoberg alleged that the prince touched her breast while they sat on a couch in Epstein's Manhattan apartment in 2001 in documents from a defamation case. Buckingham Palace has issued strong denials of all allegations against the prince. And Prince Andrew's ex-wife, Sarah Ferguson,wrote on Friday,externalthat the prince was a ""true [and] real gentleman and is stoically steadfast not only [in] his duty but also his kindness"". In 2015, a statement from the palace said that ""any suggestion of impropriety with underage minors"" by the prince was ""categorically untrue"". The prince first met Epstein in 1999 and they saw each other on several occasions after that. In 2005, the parents of a 14-year-old girl told police in Florida that Epstein had molested their daughter at his Palm Beach home. Prosecutors forged a deal with Epstein in 2008, which saw him avoid federal charges. He instead received an 18-month prison sentence, during which he was able to go on ""work release"" to his office for 12 hours a day, six days a week. He was released on probation after 13 months. In a statement released by Buckingham Palace in August, the prince said he was ""appalled"" by the sex abuse claims surrounding his former friend. The statement added: ""His royal highness deplores the exploitation of any human being and the suggestion he would condone, participate in or encourage any such behaviour is abhorrent."" This video can not be played Prince Andrew and Jeffrey Epstein: What we know and what we don't Discussing how the BBC's interview was secured, Emily Maitlis told Newsnight on Friday that talks with the palace had been ongoing for ""many months"" and had intensified following Epstein's death.

"The Green Party has pledged to introduce a universal basic income by 2025, which would see every adult receiving a minimum of Â£89 per week. Additional payments would go to those facing barriers to work, including disabled people and single parents. Speaking to the BBC, the party's co-leader Sian Berry said the proposal would cost an additional Â£76bn which would be funded through taxation. She said the policy would create ""more jobs than ever before"". LIVE: Latest from the campaign trail Basic income of Â£48 a week in UK urged Finland basic income trial left people 'happier but jobless Could a Â£2,400 basic income end poverty? Under the Green Party's plans, the income would replace universal credit - the benefit for working-age people which covers six benefits including housing benefit and child tax credits. All benefits except housing benefit and carer's allowance would be incorporated into the new payments, which would be phased in over five years. The party argues that under its plan someone working full time on the the minimum wage would see their income rise by 32%. Ms Berry said: ""Only the Green Party has the policies and ambition to eliminate the cruelty of the benefits system and tackle poverty head-on. ""Financial security is the key to a good society... people receiving a universal income will have more choices, and more people will be able to cut working hours to retrain, start new green businesses, take part in community action or simply improve their wellbeing."" This video can not be played A pilot scheme in Finland is giving 2,000 unemployed people an income, instead of benefits The idea of a universal basic income has already been trialled in other countries, including western Kenya, the Netherlands and Italy. Researchers looking at a pilot scheme in Finland said that while employment levels did not improve, participants said they felt happier and less stressed. And Labour's John McDonnell has previously said Labour could include a plan for a universal basic income in its manifesto. In May, the shadow chancellor welcomed a report into universal basic incomes as ""an important contribution to the debate around inequality, austerity, poverty and how we establish a fair and just economic system"". ""Whatever mechanism we use, whether 'basic income' or another, we have to lead in developing a radical mechanism aimed at eradicating poverty, but also means testing."" Opponents of a basic income say cuts would have to be made elsewhere. The Department for Work and Pensions has previously said the scheme would ""not work for those who need more support"".

The Church of Scotland has confirmed he will not be allowed to work as a minister while inquiries continue. A spokeswoman for the church said: ""In accordance with our procedures Rev Richard Cameron has been administratively suspended. ""This is to allow us to carry out an inquiry in relation to the incident which took place earlier this week and the subsequent complaints about his social media use."" In one tweet Rev Cameron, the minister at Scotstoun Parish Church in Glasgow, compared homosexuality to incest, describing them as ""unnatural"". ""Both cause harm by breaking sensibly held taboos,"" he added. In September, he tweeted: ""Christ has the power to help and change anyone. Obviously many gays hate this because want to carry on their perversion."" He also shared a series of controversial views on Islam, describing terrorism as ""a problem Islam needs to deal with"", a full face veil as ""oppressive and unBritish"" and the Prophet Muhammad as ""a violent man"". In another post, he said: ""The best way to defeat Islam is to preach Christ"". When initially alerted to the tweets, the church said it ""deplored comments which were Islamophobic or homophobic"". Rev Cameron, who worked in pharmaceutical sales before joining the church, has been minister at Scotstoun since 2000.

"Streets in Worksop town centre became rivers as water flooded the town Delays in opening a sluice gate exacerbated flooding in a town where people were rescued from chest-high water, a council leader has said. Council officials and residents in Worksop repeatedly asked the Canal and River Trust (CRT) to alleviate the flooding by opening the sluice gate. The trust refused to do so and the gate was eventually opened by a firefighter several hours later. The CRT told the BBC it would have been ""unsafe"" for its engineers to open it. However, the leader of Bassetlaw District Council insisted opening the sluice gate was ""vitally important"" and said it was ""bizarre"" the CRT would not do it. Homes and businesses, including Worksop Delivery Office, were deluged ""One of the things that has most angered local people is the way in which, sadly, the Canal and River Trust did not step up to respond when they could have done,"" said councillor Simon Greaves. ""We knew it was vitally important that the gate was opened in order to mitigate the volume of water we were dealing with, and that's why we made repeated demands that it was opened. ""It was almost like ringing someone up that had no idea where we were, what was happening, or what the reality of the situation was and the urgency of the situation. ""For several hours there could have been more water being taken from the town centre, helping to alleviate and mitigate the crisis."" Several cars and caravans were damaged beyond repair at the Riverside Caravan Park Worksop was flooded on 7 November when the River Ryton burst its banks following heavy rain. Twenty-five properties were evacuated, while people in 65 others were made aware of the risk but decided to stay, the fire service said. Two homeless men almost drowned when they became trapped in an industrial wheelie bin they had been sleeping in, the fire service said, while the garage door of the town's bus station was caved in by the force of the water. Damian West, who was the duty strategic manager, said: ""We had fast flowing currents of water on the streets, which basically turned into rivers."" Nottinghamshire Fire and Rescue Service boat teams helped people escape from their homes The town was previously flooded in 2007, meaning some residents and businesses flooded for a second time had been unable to get insurance. Kathy Frankland, site manager of the Riverside Caravan Park, said she phoned the CRT as early at 8:00 GMT and asked it to open the sluice gate - 15 hours before it was eventually opened. ""I called three times and I kept asking if it had been opened,"" said Ms Frankland, whose caravan and car were damaged beyond repair. Plans to build thousands of new homes in flood zones Flooding causes disruption across East Midlands Major train disruption as flooding hits England Her friend Theresa Downing, who stays at the site, said she phoned the CRT at 12:00. ""They said there was no flood alert on the River Ryton and I said 'I'm stood looking at it and I'm telling you it has burst its banks',"" she said. ""They sent somebody out, there was somebody here at 1 o'clock in the afternoon, and they still did not open that gate. ""We feel very let down."" The sluice gate was eventually opened by a firefighter A sluice gate is a barrier designed to control the flow of water Opening the gate allows water to flow from one area to another The sluice gate in question is in a park in Worksop called The Canch Opening the sluice gate allows water to flow from the River Ryton into another channel of water, which eventually feeds into the Chesterfield Canal This lowers the level of the Ryton The CRT said the sluice gate was in a building ""deemed unsafe"" for its workers to enter, and it had reported the condition of the building to the council on 16 October. The building is owned by the council but the CRT is responsible for the sluice gate. The CRT also said there were ""some concerns about how it [opening the gate] would impact water levels elsewhere, because it's hard to determine how other areas would have been affected"".

"Mr Muir said plastic pollution on Jura had been getting worse over the last few years A stag died after becoming entangled in plastic tape on a Scottish island. It is feared the animal was trapped in the discarded strapping for a week before he was discovered on Jura in the Inner Hebrides. Gamekeeper Scott Muir, 32, found him struggling on an island hillside on Wednesday. He believes the stag went without food for about a week as his mouth was jammed closed by the debris. The animal had to be put down. Mr Muir said the stag was likely to have got his antler caught in the plastic while grazing on seaweed on the coastline. He believed the stag then walked for about a mile on to the hillside before reaching his final resting point. Mr Muir said: ""I was walking over the estate when I saw the plastic waste and realised there was a stag caught. ""I thought it was dead at first but as I approached it I could see his head start to move. ""These can be 18st animals and I know how powerful they can be, but he looked tired and stressed and he couldn't see because the plastic was right around his antlers"". Stags on Rum found tangled in discarded fishing gear Attempt to save deer trapped in creel frame on Rum Endangered red squirrel dies trapped in plastic jar Mr Muir is a volunteer for Wild Side of Jura, a group which aims to protect the west coast of the island. He said the plastic pollution on the island had been getting worse over the last six years and believed commercial fishing was probably responsible. The picture was posted on social media and local residents expressed their anger. One resident said: ""That's shocking, poor animal, the thought of him struggling with that for hours makes me so angry.

"The latestScottish Health Survey,externalattempts to measure the wellbeing of people living in Scotland. So, what does it reveal about the nation's drinking, smoking and exercise habits? Mental health is the first item on the survey this year, marking its rise up the health policy agenda. The survey uses the Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Wellbeing Scale (WEMWBS) and the General Health Questionnaire 12 (GHQ 12) to monitor ""mental wellbeing"". In 2018, the mean score for adults on the WEMWBS was 49.4, which was not significantly lower than 2017 (49.8) but it was the lowest since 2008 when this question began being asked. The GHQ-12 questionnaire showed that 19% of adults exhibited signs of a possible psychiatric disorder (GHQ-12 score of four or more), the highest in the time series since 2003. Despite World Health Organisation guidelines recommending five portions of fruit and vegetables per day, most Scots are falling well below the target. In 2018, 22% of adults met the 5-a-day recommendation, which is fairly consistent with results since 2003. The survey said 10% did not consume any fruit or vegetables on previous day. The survey showed that the average adult managed just 3.2 portions. Just 15% of children met the 5-a-day recommendation. According to the survey, consumption of sugary soft drinks had fallen considerably for both adults and children. In 2018, 10% of adults consumed sugary drinks every day, down from 20% in 2016. About 16% of children aged 2-15 consumed non-diet soft drinks daily, down from 35% in 2015/2016. A survey question about food security found that 16% of adults in the most deprived areas reported being worried about running out of food, compared with 4% in the least deprived areas. Two-thirds (65%) of adults in Scotland are overweight, the survey says. This includes 28% who are obese. These trends have remained stable since 2008. About a third of adults have a ""healthy weight"" - a Body Mass Index (BMI) of 18.5 to 25 kg/m2. The average BMI of Scots has shown a small upward trend from 27.1 in 2003 to 27.7 in 2018. Prevalence of children at risk of obesity has remained relatively stable in 2018 at 16%. Despite a decrease over the years in the number of adults drinking at hazardous or harmful levels, the figure is not going down very quickly. The 24% figure for 2018 was the same as the previous year but down from 34% in 2003. Men continued to be twice as likely as women to drink at hazardous or harmful levels. Among men, the highest prevalence of harmful drinking was among those aged 55-64. On average, it said men drank 16.1 units and women 8.9. Guidelines say men and women should consume no more than 14 units a week - equivalent to six pints of beer or seven glasses of wine. The prevalence of smoking among adults in 2018 was 19%, according to the survey, That figure was actually slightly up on the 2017 figure but is well down from 2003 (28%). In the most-deprived areas 33% of adults smoked, the survey said, as opposed to just 10% in the least deprived areas. There has been a steady decline over time in the average number of cigarettes smoked per day from 15.3 in 2003 to 11.8 last year. The percentage of adults who had never smoked regularly or at all was at its highest level in 2018 at 59%. Levels of e-cigarette smokers remained steady at 7%. In 2018, two-thirds of adults (66%) met the guidelines for moderate or vigorous physical activity (MVPA), the  highest level in the time series, though it has not changed significantly since 2013. Men (70%) continued to be more likely than women (62%) to meet the MVPA guidelines. The survey said that in 2018 about 8% of all children aged 0 to 15 were reported to be diagnosed with asthma by a doctor -the lowest level to date. The prevalence of self-reported asthma diagnoses among adults increased from 13% in 2003 to 16% in 2012 and has remained stable since. Among adults aged 16 and over, 16% had some form of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and 7% reported doctor-diagnosed diabetes (primarily type 2). The survey said 5% had IHD (ischaemic heart disease) and 3% reported having a stroke. It said 71% of adults, in 2018, described their health as 'good' or 'very good', the lowest recorded since 2008. The annual Scottish Health Survey questioned 4,810 adults and 1,983 children. It is designed to give a representative sample of the general population.

"Kelly Mayhew died in 2015 after a botched operation A British woman convicted of killing a US patient by giving her botched buttock-enhancement injections has been sentenced to a year in New York jail. Donna Francis had pleaded guilty to criminally negligent homicide for the 2015 death of Kelly Mayhew after she was extradited from the UK in August. Francis was given the maximum sentence allowed in the extradition agreement. ""The phrase 'getting away with murder' certainly applies to you,"" New York Judge Kenneth Holder said on Thursday. ""If you have a conscience, this is going to haunt you much longer than the one-year sentence you're going to serve."" Francis, 39, who is originally from Loughton, Essex, was sentenced in the Queens Supreme Court in New York for causing the death of Mayhew in May 2015. At her sentencing, Francis was in tears, and said she regretted the incident. ""It wasn't my intention to hurt anyone,"" she said. ""I'm sorry for all the years this has been going on. I'm just sorry."" Mayhew and her mother had travelled to New York from Maryland to pay Francis - who has no medical licence - $1,600 (Â£1,200) for a buttock enhancement procedure. Mayhew went into cardiac arrest after the botched silicone injections were administered in the basement of a house. Her brother, who read a statement on behalf of their mother in court, said Francis had refused to call 911 or provide an address to give first responders,the New York Post reported,external. Mayhew eventually died from systemic silicone emboli, when the unencapsulated silicone entered her bloodstream and caused an embolism, the medical examiner found. Prosecutors said Francis had left the dying woman and her mother and fled to London, where she remained until the extradition deal was reached this summer.

"Streets in Worksop town centre became rivers as water flooded the town Delays in opening a sluice gate exacerbated flooding in a town where people were rescued from chest-high water, a council leader has said. Council officials and residents in Worksop repeatedly asked the Canal and River Trust (CRT) to alleviate the flooding by opening the sluice gate. The trust refused to do so and the gate was eventually opened by a firefighter several hours later. The CRT told the BBC it would have been ""unsafe"" for its engineers to open it. However, the leader of Bassetlaw District Council insisted opening the sluice gate was ""vitally important"" and said it was ""bizarre"" the CRT would not do it. Homes and businesses, including Worksop Delivery Office, were deluged ""One of the things that has most angered local people is the way in which, sadly, the Canal and River Trust did not step up to respond when they could have done,"" said councillor Simon Greaves. ""We knew it was vitally important that the gate was opened in order to mitigate the volume of water we were dealing with, and that's why we made repeated demands that it was opened. ""It was almost like ringing someone up that had no idea where we were, what was happening, or what the reality of the situation was and the urgency of the situation. ""For several hours there could have been more water being taken from the town centre, helping to alleviate and mitigate the crisis."" Several cars and caravans were damaged beyond repair at the Riverside Caravan Park Worksop was flooded on 7 November when the River Ryton burst its banks following heavy rain. Twenty-five properties were evacuated, while people in 65 others were made aware of the risk but decided to stay, the fire service said. Two homeless men almost drowned when they became trapped in an industrial wheelie bin they had been sleeping in, the fire service said, while the garage door of the town's bus station was caved in by the force of the water. Damian West, who was the duty strategic manager, said: ""We had fast flowing currents of water on the streets, which basically turned into rivers."" Nottinghamshire Fire and Rescue Service boat teams helped people escape from their homes The town was previously flooded in 2007, meaning some residents and businesses flooded for a second time had been unable to get insurance. Kathy Frankland, site manager of the Riverside Caravan Park, said she phoned the CRT as early at 8:00 GMT and asked it to open the sluice gate - 15 hours before it was eventually opened. ""I called three times and I kept asking if it had been opened,"" said Ms Frankland, whose caravan and car were damaged beyond repair. Plans to build thousands of new homes in flood zones Flooding causes disruption across East Midlands Major train disruption as flooding hits England Her friend Theresa Downing, who stays at the site, said she phoned the CRT at 12:00. ""They said there was no flood alert on the River Ryton and I said 'I'm stood looking at it and I'm telling you it has burst its banks',"" she said. ""They sent somebody out, there was somebody here at 1 o'clock in the afternoon, and they still did not open that gate. ""We feel very let down."" The sluice gate was eventually opened by a firefighter A sluice gate is a barrier designed to control the flow of water Opening the gate allows water to flow from one area to another The sluice gate in question is in a park in Worksop called The Canch Opening the sluice gate allows water to flow from the River Ryton into another channel of water, which eventually feeds into the Chesterfield Canal This lowers the level of the Ryton The CRT said the sluice gate was in a building ""deemed unsafe"" for its workers to enter, and it had reported the condition of the building to the council on 16 October. The building is owned by the council but the CRT is responsible for the sluice gate. The CRT also said there were ""some concerns about how it [opening the gate] would impact water levels elsewhere, because it's hard to determine how other areas would have been affected"". ""Our staff have worked admirably at numerous locations to deal with incidents, including through the night in many cases,"" it added.

"The UK is about to have yet another general election and soon the internet and airwaves will be filled with talk of marginals, hustings and spin. But what do all these things really mean? We're here to help. Use our translator tool to check the meaning of some of the words used around election time. Backbencher Term for an MP who is not a minister. They sit behind the front benches in the House of commons. Ballot Another term for vote. Ballot box A sealed box with a slit in the lid. Voters place their ballot papers through the slit into the box. When polls close the boxes are opened and counting begins. Ballot paper Paper containing a list of all candidates standing in a constituency. Voters mark their choice with a cross. By-election An election held between general elections, usually because the sitting MP has died or resigned. Candidate Someone putting themselves up for election. Once Parliament has been dissolved, there are no MPs, only candidates. Canvassing During a campaign, active supporters of a party ask voters who they will vote for and try to drum up support for their own candidates. Close of nominations The deadline for candidates standing to send in the officials forms confirming their place in the election. This is usually __ days before polling day. Coalition When two or more parties govern together, when neither has an overall majority. After the 2010 election, the Conservatives and Lib Dems formed a coalition, which lasted for five years. Confidence and supply A agreement between two political parties where the smaller party agrees to support a larger one without enough MPs to have a majority in parliament. Conservative The Conservative party is Constituency The geographical unit which elects a single MP. There are 650 in the UK. Dead cat In politics, a 'dead cat' strategy is when a dramatic or sensational story is disclosed to divert attention away from something more damaging.  The term comes from the concept of an imaginary dead cat being flung onto a dining table, causing the diners to become distracted by it. Declaration The announcement of the election result in each constituency. Deposit A sum of Â£500 paid by candidates or their parties to be allowed to stand. It is returned if the candidate wins 5% or more of the votes cast. Devolution The delegation of powers to other parliaments within the UK, specifically the Scottish Parliament and Welsh and Northern Ireland Assemblies. Devolved parliament The Scottish Parliament and Welsh and Northern Ireland assemblies are elected by voters in those nations of the UK. They make laws on policy areas controlled by those nations such as health, environment and education. Dissolution of Parliament The act of ending a Parliament before an election. When parliament is dissolved there are no MPs, but the prime minister and other senior ministers remain in their roles. Electoral register / roll A list of everyone in a constituency entitled to vote. Also known as electoral roll. Exit poll An exit poll is a poll of voters leaving a voting station. They are asked how they have voted, and the results are used to forecast what the overall result of the election may be. First past the post Term used to describe the UK's parliamentary election system. It means a candidate only needs to win the most votes in their constituency to win the seat. Gain When a party wins a constituency from another party, it is said to have ""gained"" it from the other. General election Election at which all seats in the House of Commons are contested. Hung parliament If after an election no party has an overall majority, then parliament is said to be ""hung"". The main parties will then try to form a coalition with one or more of the minor parties. Opinion polls have suggested that a hung parliament is a strong possibility after the 2015 general election. Hustings A meeting a which candidates address potential voters. The word comes from an old Norse word meaning ""house of assembly"". Independent A candidate who is not a member of any political party and is standing on their own personal platform. To qualify as an official political party, a party must be registered with the Electoral Commission, the organisation which administers elections in the UK. Landslide The name given to an election which one party wins by a very large margin.

Left wing A person or party with strong socialist policies or beliefs. Liberal Democrat The name of the party occupying the centre ground of British politics. They were formed from the former Liberal party and Social Democrats, a Labour splinter group, and combine support for traditional liberalism such as religious tolerance and individual freedom, with support for social justice. Majority A majority in Parliament means one side has at least one more vote than all the other parties combined and is therefore more likely to be able to push through any legislative plans. Majority government When one party wins more than half of the seats in the Commons, they can rule alone in a majority government Mandate Politicians say they have a mandate, or authority, to carry out a policy when they have the backing of the electorate. Manifesto A public declaration of a party's ideas and policies, usually printed during the campaign. Once in power, a government is often judged by how many of its manifesto promises it manages to deliver. Marginal Seats where the gap between the two or more leading parties is relatively small. Often regarded as less than a 10% margin or requiring a swing (see below) of 5% or less, though very dependent on prevailing political conditions. Minority government A minority government is one that does not have a majority of the seats in Parliament. It means the government is less likely to be able to push through any legislative programme. Boris Johnson has suffered a number of defeats in Parliament over a no-deal Brexit because he does not have a majority. MP Strictly this includes members of the House of Lords, but in practice means only members of the House of Commons. When an election is called Parliament is dissolved and there are no more MPs until it assembles again. Nomination papers A candidate must be nominated on these documents by 10 voters living in the constituency. Opinion poll A survey asking people's opinion on one or more issues. In an election campaign, the key question is usually about which party people will vote for. Opposition The largest party not in government is known as the official opposition. It receives extra parliamentary funding in recognition of its status. Party Election Broadcast Broadcasts made by the parties and transmitted on TV or radio. By agreement with the broadcasters, each party is allowed a certain number according to its election strength and number of candidates fielded. Percentage swing The swing shows how far voter support for a party has changed between elections. It is calculated by comparing the percentage of the vote won in a particular election to the figure obtained in the previous election. Polling day Election day Polling station Place where people go to cast their votes Postal vote People unable to get to a polling station are allowed to vote by post if they apply in advance. Proportional representation (PR) Any voting system where the share of seats represents the share of votes is described as proportional representation. The UK currently has a first past the post system. Prorogation Parliament is usually prorogued, or suspended, ahead of an election or Queen's Speech to allow for preparations. In September 2019 Boris Johnson attempted to prorogue Parliament for five weeks, but the Supreme Court later ruled the prorogation unlawful and MPs returned to Parliament. Psephologist A person who studies voting and voting patterns. Purdah This is the time between the announcement of an election and the final election results. During this period media organisations have to ensure any political reporting is balanced and is not likely to influence the outcome of the election. Recount If a result is close, any candidate may ask for a recount. The process can be repeated several times if necessary until the candidates are satisfied. The returning officer has the final say on whether a recount takes place. Returning officer The official in charge of elections in each of the constituencies. On election night they read out the results for each candidate in alphabetical order by surname. Right wing Someone who is right wing in politics usually supports tradition and authority, as well as capitalism. The Conservative party is regarded as the main centre-right party in the UK. Safe seat A safe seat is a constituency where an MP has a sufficiently large majority to be considered unwinnable by the opposition. Spin room The attempt to place a favourable interpretation on an event so that people or the media will interpret it in that way. Those performing this act are known as spin doctors. Spoiled ballot Any ballot paper that is not marked clearly, eg with more than one box ticked or with writing scrawled across it, is described as a spoiled ballot and does not count towards the result. Tactical voting This is when people vote not for the party they really support, but for another party in order to keep out a more disliked rival. Target seat In theory, any seat that a party contests and held by a rival is one of its targets. In practice, a target seat is one that a party believes it can win and puts a lot of effort into doing so. Turnout Turnout is the percentage of eligible voters who cast a ballot on polling day. Vote of no confidence It is usually the leader of the opposition, currently Jeremy Corby, who calls for a vote of no confidence, in an attempt to topple the government. If more MPs vote for the motion than against it, then the government has 14 days to try to win back the confidence of MPs through another vote â while the opposition parties try to form an alternative government. If nothing is resolved, then a general election is triggered. Westminster The UK Parliament is located in the Palace of Westminster in the centre of London and the term is often used as an alternative to Parliament. Working majority A working majority in Parliament is what a government needs to carry out its legislative programme without risk of defeat. It means the government can rely on at least one more vote than the opposition parties. However, in the current Parliament, the government no longer has a majority and MPs from a range of opposition parties have joined forces to form a parliamentary majority big enough to defeat the government over plans for a no-deal Brexit.  Is when supporters of a party ask voters who they will vote for and try to drum up support for their own candidates. They do this by promoting the party's policies and their candidates' personal qualities. Each candidate must pay a Â£500 deposit to run for parliament. The money is paid by the parties or the candidate themselves, and they get it back if they win 5% or more of the votes cast. Parliament is broken up - or dissolved - 25 working days before election day. When parliament is dissolved there are no MPs, but the prime minister and ministers remain in their jobs. A survey in which voters leaving a polling station are asked how they voted. The results are analysed and used to forecast the overall result of the election. An election where no one party wins a majority is said to end in a hung parliament. Usually the largest party then tries to form a partnership with another party as a coalition government. A majority in Parliament means one party has at least one more seat than all the others put together. That means it is likely to win votes on its policies and plans in Parliament, which can then be implemented. Opinion polls ask people which party they will vote for in the election. The results are used to suggest how much of the vote each party could get across the whole country. But the vote share does not necessarily translate to who gets a majority of seats in Parliament. Polls are also used to find out opinions on a range of issues Anyone registered to vote can apply for a postal vote ahead of the election. Postal votes are particularly useful for people who can't get to a polling station on election day. Information on how to apply for a postal vote is available online. An effort to get voters to back a party they don't really support in an effort to defeat another party. Parties with similar policies sometimes do deals so that one stands aside to give the other a better chance of winning but the practice can be controversial.

"Boris Johnson has claimed there will be no border in the Irish Sea as a result of his Brexit deal. Under the deal NI will continue to follow many EU rules on food and manufactured goods, while the rest of the UK will not. NI will also continue to follow EU customs rules but will remain part of the UK's customs territory. A government risk assessment says that will lead tonew administration and checks on goods entering NI from GB. No checks on goods between NI and GB, says PM 'Minimal' checks needed on NI-GB trade movements Those new processes and checks are widely interpreted as amounting to ""an Irish Sea border."" Mr Johnson was taking part in a BBC phone in and was questioned by a caller from Belfast. He told her there would be no checks on any goods from NI to the rest of the UK. He was asked if he could commit that NI businesses would not encounter additional paperwork or fees when dealing with GB. He said: ""I absolutely can. This is a matter for the UK government and we will make sure that businesses face no extra costs and no checks for stuff being exported from NI to GB."" However Mr Johnson gave no commitments on what would happen with GB to NI trade. 'Loyalist disorder' warning if Brexit threatens union Brexit deal 'could reduce investment in NI' Why ministers won't release Brexit forecast Under his deal means Northern Ireland will remain part of a ""single regulatory zone"" with the Republic of Ireland, a zone that will apply EU rules. The EU has particularly strict rules on the importation of ""products of animal origin"" - meat, fish and dairy products. Those products must enter the EU through a border inspection post where all shipments are subject to document checks and a high proportion are physically checked. Products of animal origin from Great Britain entering Northern Ireland would be subject to these checks. This video can not be played ""There will not be checks on goods going from NI to GB,"" Boris Johnson tells Conservative supporters A few countries, such as New Zealand, have a deal with the EU where only 1% of consignments are checked. It is possible that the UK could negotiate a similar deal but it would not be able to eliminate checks entirely unless the whole of the UK was going to stay in the single market. The current political declaration, which sets out the broad shape of the future EU-UK relationship, suggests that is unlikely. Mr Johnson said that if the deal was found not to be working for the people of Northern Ireland thenthe Stormont Assembly can vote to leave that regulatory zone. The caller pointed out that Stormont has not sat for over 1,000 days - Mr Johnson said this was 'a great shame.' The Prime Minister also said he was ""1,000,000% committed"" to maintaining the union between Northern Ireland and Great Britain.

"There are 650 constituencies in the UK but most of the campaigning for the general election will take place in a smaller number. As ever, much of the focus will be on marginal constituencies - places where the winning majority in 2017 was small. However, at this election the parties will also be targeting a large number of constituencies beyond the marginal seats. There will be a lot of focus on areas that voted strongly to Leave or strongly to Remain in the EU referendum - even where the majorities are large. Big swings cannot be ruled out. A striking aspect of the2017 general electionwas that the result in lots of constituencies was very close. The normal working definition for a marginal seat is one where the majority is under 10%, which usually means under about 5,000 votes - although that does depend on turnout and the size of the constituency. Then, within that group of seats, there are the ultra-marginals: places where the majority is under 2% - about 1,000 votes. In 2017 there were 51 of these ultra-marginals - considerably more than in previous elections. In fact there were eight seats with a majority under 50. All those will be hotly contested. The Conservatives will be hoping to win back some of the seats they lost last time - likeCanterbury,external,Keighley,externalandKensington,external- while Labour will try to take seats where it got within a whisker - such asArfon,external,Pudsey,externalandSouthampton Itchen,external. And the Lib Dems will hope to win seats they've previously held likeRichmond Park,external,St Ives,externalandSheffield Hallam,external. In Scotland there are 46 marginal seats, using the 10% definition, out of a total of 59. So almost all the constituencies are potentially in play. Of particular interest will be the 21 seats lost by the SNP in 2017. Nearly all voted Remain in the EU referendum so the SNP hopes its anti-Brexit stance will help it to recapture as many of them as possible. In many cases it would only take a small shift - places likeStirling,externalandGordon,external, held by the Conservatives, andRutherglen & Hamilton West,externalandMidlothian,external, both held by Labour. Another seat to keep an eye on is Fife North East. It's the most marginal constituency in the whole country with an SNP majority over the Liberal Democrats of just two votes. In fact, that's the smallest majority in any seat this century. It's not just Scotland where Brexit will influence which seats are targeted. Strongly Leave and strongly Remain areas are likely to be crucial. The Conservatives are hoping to capture longstanding Labour constituencies that voted heavily to Leave - even those outside the normal marginal range. The map shows that these are concentrated in the Midlands and parts of the north of England - seats likeWest Bromwich West,external,Bolsover,external, andHyndburn,external. However, the Brexit Party has a similar goal. It describesHartlepool,externalas its number one target. On the other hand, the Liberal Democrats are targeting heavily-Remain seats, mostly in the south of England, even though some have quite big majorities. Places likeSt Albans,external,Winchester,external, andCambridge,external. Another feature of the Brexit battle at this election is the agreement made by the Liberal Democrats, Plaid Cymru and Green Party to stand aside for one another in 60 seats across England and Wales. It's impossible to know whether this will affect who wins any of the constituencies but it should give a boost to Plaid in places likeLlanelli,externalandYnys Mon,externaland to the Lib Dems in seats includingHazel Grove,externalandThornbury & Yate,external. Lib Dems, Greens and Plaid agree election pact Brexit Party will not stand in Tory seats Corbyn rules out election pacts with rival parties What is tactical voting? Where parties choose to put up candidates could have a bigger impact in Northern Ireland than anywhere else. InBelfast South,external, for example, Sinn Fein is standing aside in favour of the SDLP to increase its chances of ousting the DUP. The SDLP will return the favour in Belfast North. Meanwhile inFermanagh & South Tyrone,externalthe DUP will stand aside to assist the UUP, as it did in 2017. Another seat to keep an eye on isFoyle,externalwhere it's a different story. It's the most marginal constituency in Northern Ireland and was a Sinn Fein gain from the SDLP last time. One of the features of recent general elections has been Labour's increasing dominance in London. As a region it used to be fairly representative of the whole country, politically speaking, but over time that has changed. In 2017 Labour won 49 of the 73 seats across the city. There's also evidence that the effect has started to spill out from central London to the outskirts and to constituencies in the surrounding areas. That seems to be linked to an increase in the number of people leaving London - especially those in their 30s and 40s. Labour will be hoping that this demographic change could help it in seats likeChingford & Woodford Green,external,Crawley,external, andMilton Keynes South,external- all popular destinations for people leaving London.

"A worker applying a capping layer to a landfill site in Hangzhou China's largest dump is already full - 25 years ahead of schedule. The Jiangcungou landfill in Shaanxi Province, which is the size of around 100 football fields, was designed to take 2,500 tonnes of rubbish per day. But instead it received 10,000 tonnes of waste per day - the most of any landfill site in China. China is one of the world's biggest polluters, and has been struggling for years with the rubbish its 1.4 billion citizens generate. The Jiangcungou landfill in Xi'an city was built in 1994 and was designed to last until 2044. The landfill serves over 8 million citizens. It spans an area of almost 700,000 square metres, with a depth of 150 metres and a storage capacity of more than 34 million cubic metres. Until recently, Xi'an was one of the few cities in China that solely relied on landfill to dispose of household waste - leading to capacity being reached early. Earlier this month, a new incineration plant was opened, and at least four more are expected to open by 2020. Together, they are expected to be able to process 12,750 tonnes of rubbish per day. The move is part of a national plan to reduce the number of landfills, and instead use other waste disposal methods like incineration. The landfill site in Xi'an will eventually become an ""ecological park"". In 2017, China collected215 million tonnes of urban household waste,external, according to the country's statistical yearbook. That's up from 152 millionten years earlier.,external The country had 654 landfill sites and 286 incineration plants. It is not clear what China's recycling rate is, as no figures have been released. China plans to recycle 35% of waste in major cities by the end of 2020, according toone government report.,external This July, sorting and recycling rubbish was made mandatory in Shanghai - leading to""a sense of panic""among some residents. Social angst high as Shanghai gets tough on rubbish A blockage in global waste disposal In 2015, there was a landslide at a rubbish dump in the southern city of Shenzhen,killing 73 people. The dump was designed to hold four million cubic metres worth of rubbish, with a maximum height of 95 metres. When it collapsed, it was holding 5.8m cubic metres of material with waste heaps up to 160m high. One town in Malaysia was left swamped with foreign waste Not anymore. It used to, until the end of 2017 when it decided to ban the import of 24different grades of rubbish. In 2017 alone, China took in seven million tonnes of plastic rubbish from Europe, Japan and the US - and 27 million tonnes of waste paper. Other countries, including Malaysia, Turkey, the Philippines and Indonesia, have picked up some of the slack. Who's sending back plastic waste? The small town with a dirty secret Reality Check: Where is the plastic waste mountain? But they struggled to deal with the amount of waste coming in - often times resulting in massive, out-of-control landfills in their own countries. Some of these countries have now banned the import of certain types of rubbish and are even sending it back.

"This video can not be played These Hong Kong university students fought police on Tuesday with bows and arrows A man has died in Hong Kong after being hit on the head during clashes between government supporters and protesters. The government said the 70-year-old cleaner was on a lunch break on Wednesday when he was struck by ""hard objects hurled by masked rioters"". In London, Hong Kong's Justice Secretary Teresa Cheng was hurt after being jostled by anti-government protesters, the Chinese embassy said. Protests have rocked Hong Kong for months and violence is escalating. Ms Cheng is seen as having played a key role in promoting an unpopular bill allowing extradition to mainland China, which triggered the protests. China strongly condemned the incident and called for a thorough investigation. Chinese President Xi Jinping issued a strong warning to protesters. Speaking at a summit of BRICS countries in Brazil, he said ""radical violent activities"" in Hong Kong ""seriously challenged the [principle of] 'one country, two systems'"". The 70-year-old was hit in the head during a protest in the Hong Kong border town of Sheung Shui. Video purported to be of the incident shows two groups throwing bricks at each other before the man falls to the ground after being struck on the head. A police superintendent told news outlet SCMP that the cleaner was not involved, and was ""only taking pictures at the scene"". He died in hospital on Thursday. The Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) said the man was an outsourced worker of theirs who had been on his lunch break. Hong Kong in first recession for a decade Hong Kong protests explained in 100 and 500 words Hong Kong pushed to 'brink of total collapse' Hong Kong to close schools amid tense protests The FEHD also condemned the protesters,calling them ""extremely dangerous"".,external ""[They] conducted violent acts in various districts three days in a row, where they wantonly assaulted other members of the public,"" the statement added. ""The acts are outrageous."" Hong Kong has seen an escalation in violence this week, with intense street battles, violent clashes at universities, and flashmob lunchtime protests. On Monday, a police officer shot an activist in the torso with a live bullet, and a man was set on fire while arguing with anti-government protesters. A week ago, Alex Chow, a 22-year-old student, died after falling from a building during a police operation. Hong Kong has been rocked by violence for months Ms Cheng was in London to promote Hong Kong as a dispute resolution and deal-making hub. Video showed her walking towards a lecture at the Chartered Institute of Arbitrators when she was surrounded by a group of protesters. Some held signs and shouted ""murderer"" and in the melee, Ms Cheng fell to the ground. Ms Cheng fell to the ground during the melee She regained her feet and was escorted away with no visible signs of injury, AFP reported. A statement from the Chinese embassy in the UK said Ms Cheng had been pushed to the ground and sustained a hand injury. It said the incident showed ""violent and lawless perpetrators"" were now taking their violence abroad. London's Metropolitan Police told the BBC they were investigating an allegation of assault and no arrests had been made. ""A woman was taken to hospital by London Ambulance Service suffering an injury to her arm. Enquiries are ongoing to establish the full circumstances,"" a statement said. Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam also condemned the protesters,external, saying ""the savage act breached the bottom line of any civilised society"". Hong Kong - a British colony until 1997 - is part of China under a model known as ""one country, two systems"". Under this model, Hong Kong has a high degree of autonomy and people have freedoms unseen in mainland China. The protests started in June after the government planned to pass a bill that would allow suspects to be extradited to mainland China. Many feared this bill would undermine the city's freedoms and judicial independence. The bill was eventually withdrawn but the protests continued, having evolved into a broader revolt against the police, and the way Hong Kong is administered by Beijing.

"Natasha Ednan-Laperouse died in 2016 after eating a baguette containing hidden sesame The number of children being admitted to hospital in England with a severe allergic reaction has risen every year for the past five years. NHS figures show 1,746 children were treated for anaphylactic shock in 2018-19, up from 1,015 in 2013-14. The parents ofNatasha Ednan-Laperouse, who died in 2016 after eating a baguettecontaining sesame, called the increase ""deeply alarming"". Scientists say environmental factors could be to blame for more allergies. Children under 10 were most likely to be affected by anaphylaxis, with 1,018 admitted to hospital last year - compared with 601 in 2013-14. Why the world is becoming more allergic Teens treated for allergies up 65% in five years Family demand law change after Byron burger death Boy's cheese allergy death 'unprecedented' When adults with severe allergic reactions treated in hospital were also included, the figures rose from 4,107 cases to 5,497 over five years. Anaphylaxis,externalis a severe allergic reaction which can be life-threatening. The most common causes of severe allergic reactions are foods such as nuts, fish and shellfish but they can also be triggered by wasp and bee stings, drugs and dairy products, among others. Even the tiniest exposure to one of these allergens can be enough to set off an anaphylactic reaction and bring on breathing difficulties, rapid heartbeat and loss of consciousness. Sesame is one of 14 allergens consumers must be made aware of in food products The increase in allergies is not simply due to society becoming more aware of them and better at diagnosing them. Instead,scientists believe factors such as dietary changes, exposure to microbes and pollution may play a rolein the rise - particularly for Western lifestyles. An allergy expert has previously suggested that teenagers taking risks when managing their food allergies was likely to be a factorin the increase in severe allergic reactions in that age group. Natasha's mother, Tanya Ednan-Laperouse, said: ""These terrifying figures show we are facing an allergy emergency. ""The number of children with allergies and suffering severe allergic reactions is rising year-on-year at a deeply alarming rate."" Hasan Arshad, professor of allergy and clinical immunology at the University of Southampton, said the figures confirmed ""a worrying increase in severe food allergy"". ""We should not forget that behind each of these numbers is a child or adult who has suffered the most severe consequences of an anaphylactic shock,"" he said. This video can not be played New ingredient proposals: ""This will help so many allergy sufferers,"" say Nadim and Tanya Ednan-Laperouse Fifteen-year-old Natasha had a severe and fatal allergic reaction to an artichoke, olive and tapenade baguette bought from Pret a Manger. She was allergic to sesame seed but this was not listed on the product label. Despite her father, Nadim, administering two EpiPen injections, Natasha died in a hospital within hours. Natasha's parents have campaigned for a change in the law to require producers of pre-packed foods to list all their ingredients. This law will come into force in 2021. Up until now, takeaways and restaurants have had to let customers know only if any of the 14 most dangerous allergens - including peanuts, eggs and milk - are contained in their dishes.

"Towns such as Fishlake near Doncaster were hit hard by recent flooding Almost 10,000 new homes could be built on some of the most flood-prone areas of England, a Greenpeace investigation has found. They include hundreds of new-builds in Sheffield and Doncaster, the towns hit hardest by the latest floods. The Environment Agency told the BBC that virtually all planning applications last year followed its advice on flood risk. But it predicts the flooding risk will increase because of climate change. The Greenpeace study comes as hundreds of flood-hit homes in South Yorkshire and Derbyshire are still evacuated. It identifies plans to build a total of 9,688 new homes in high-risk areas. More than 5,000 homes have been proposed in high-risk zones of Lincolnshire, where roads and thousands of acres of farmland have been flooded in the last few days. The developments include Boston United Football Club's new 5,000-seater stadium. The research also highlighted a 3,100-home ""new town"" near Stainforth, less than two miles from Fishlake, the village where hundreds of people have been forced from their homes because of flooding. The project includes what has been described by developers as a ""marina"". These properties have not yet received full planning permission but have been ear-marked by the local authority for development. The Greenpeace study selected the 10 English councils with the highest percentage of land covered by high-risk areas using the Environment Agency's map. It then plotted these against sites that the councils listed in their five-year plans for housing supply. Sheffield and Doncaster were added after the recent flooding in those areas. The work found that, as well as hundreds of new homes in high-risk areas of these towns, thousands of homes are planned for medium-risk zones. Greenpeace's chief scientist Doug Parr said the decision was ""planning for disaster"" The Environment Agency defines a high-risk flood zone as one where there is a one in 100 chance of flooding in any given year. Medium-risk zones are areas where there is a one in 1,000 risk of flooding in any year. Greenpeace's chief scientist, Doug Parr, described the plans to build homes in areas at high risk of flooding as ""literally planning for disaster"". ""Flooding has been flashing on the radar as one of the major impacts of the climate emergency in the UK for years,"" he said, ""yet our planning system keeps failing to properly recognise it"". The Environment Agency told the BBC that local planning authorities are responsible for approving proposals for new development in their areas. However, it said the National Planning Policy Framework makes clear that inappropriate development in areas at risk of flooding should be avoided. ""In some places it will be challenging to avoid these areas,"" the Environment Agency statement said, ""due to limited land outside the flood plain or because of other sustainable development objectives."" Nevertheless, the agency claimed that, between 2017 and 2018, 99.4% of planning applications involving new homes were decided in line with its advice on flood risk. The Local Government Association told the BBC that the figure for 2018-19 was a bit lower, at around 97.3% .

"This video can not be played Jeane Freeman has said she did not make details of the child's death public due to patient confidentiality The health secretary says she knew in September a child had died after contracting an infection possibly linked to water at Glasgow's largest hospital, but did not make it public. Jeane Freeman learned in September that the patient had died after contracting an infection in a cancer ward in 2017. She told BBC Scotland she acted on the information but chose to maintain patient confidentiality. Labour MSP Anas Sarwar has described the situation as a ""cover-up"". Ms Freeman said she felt for the child's parents. She said: ""I deeply regret not only the death of their child. In any circumstance that has to cause a pain that I can't possibly imagine, but I also deeply regret that they feel they haven't been given the information that they have a perfect right to receive and are entitled to. ""They have my commitment to act to ensure that situation does not happen to parents in the future. ""I don't regret honouring patient confidentiality. But upholding patient confidentiality does not mean I don't act on the information I am given."" Mr Sarwar had raised the issue - which was brought to light by an NHS whistleblower - during First Minister's Questions on Thursday. The whistleblower raised concerns about the findings of a review into infections in child cancer patients. The MSP said he had seen information which showed that senior managers were repeatedly alerted to the fact a previous review failed to include cases of infection related to the water supply in 2017. He said the parents of the child had never been told the true cause of their child's death. Greater Glasgow Health Board say a link between the infection and the hospital cannot be proven because regulations at the time did not require water testing. Mr Sarwar said: ""This is a remarkable confession from the health secretary. ""There are now incredibly serious questions for the government and NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde to answer, and a huge challenge to rebuild trust."" Labour MSP Anas Sarwar described the allegations as a 'scandal' He added: ""This devastating death has been covered up since September. Jeane Freeman says she acted, but the most important act would be to inform the parents. ""At the centre of this scandal is a tragic loss of life, and the priority must be seeking answers for the parents who lost a child."" Last September, two wards at the Royal Hospital for Children were closed and patients moved to the adjoining Queen Elizabeth University Hospital as Health Protection Scotland (HPS) investigated water contamination incidents. AnHPS investigationfound 23 cases of blood stream infections with organisms potentially linked to water contamination were identified between 29 January and 26 September, 2018. The Daily Record,externalreported a clinician-led team at NHSGGC investigated further back than 2018. The whistleblower who contacted Mr Sarwar claimed this investigation found up to 26 cases of water supply infections in children in the cancer wards in 2017, and that one child with cancer died after contracting an infection. In Marcha report foundsome areas of the hospital could not be cleaned properly because they were awaiting repair work. The inspection was ordered by Ms Freeman afterpatients became infectedwith a fungus linked to pigeon faeces. Mr Sarwar said he has had difficult information shared with him before but this case ""felt different"". He added: ""I immediately imagined how I would feel if that was my child, if I was that parent. I would want to know - I would expect answers."" An NHSGGC spokesman said: ""When a patient dies in our care, our clinical teams discuss with family members the cause of death and the factors that have contributed to this, where they are known. ""Patients who are very sick are prone to infections and we closely monitor all infections to ensure patients are appropriately cared for. "" He said that two individual cases of Stenotrophomonas were investigated in 2017 which were not linked and those were reported to Health Protection Scotland and the NHSGGC Board. The cases were reviewed again in July 2019 when the clinical view was taken that no further action was required. He added: ""At the time of the initial investigation into these cases, national guidance did not include a requirement for health boards to test for Stenotrophomonas in the water supply. ""As no tests were carried out at the time, it is not possible to conclude that these infections were connected to the water supply.Â  It is extremely disappointing therefore that a whistleblower has made this claim causing additional distress to families and to other families of cancer patients.""

"Taylor Swift is in a dispute with Scooter Braun (centre) and Scott Borchetta Taylor Swift's former record label has rebuffed her claims it is blocking her from performing her own hits at the forthcoming American Music Awards. The singer said music executives Scooter Braun and Scott Borchetta would not let her perform songs from her past albums, which they own the rights to. She said a Netflix documentary about her life had also been put in jeopardy. Borchetta and Braun's Big Machine Records said Swift's statement was ""based on false information"". Swift v Braun: Personal or strictly business? Taylor Swift 'bullied' by man who now owns her music Swift made the allegations in a statement posted to Twitter with the caption: ""Don't know what else to do."" Allow Twitter content?

""Right now my performance at the AMAs, the Netflix documentary and any other recorded events I am planning to play until November 2020 are a question mark,"" she wrote. But in response, the label denied telling the pop superstar she could not perform at the AMAs or trying to block the Netflix special, and said the ""narrative you have created does not exist"". Swift is being named Artist of the Decade at this month's AMAs In June, Swift revealed thatthe masters of her early music had been sold to Braun by her former record label, run by Borchetta, and alleged that she was not told about it. At the time the singer accused Braun, who also manages Ariana Grande, Justin Bieber and Demi Lovato, of ""incessant, manipulative bullying"". Swift also accused Braun of attempting to ""dismantle"" her ""musical legacy"".,externalWhile he did not respond to her comments, he was supported by Lovato and Bieber, who claimed Swift was just out ""to get sympathy"". The singer confirmed in August that she planned to re-record music from her first six albums so she could own the rights to the new versions. Swift is set to be named Artist of the Decade at the AMAs later this month and said she had been planning to perform a medley of her hits. But in her statement on Thursday, she said the two men had blocked her from performing her old songs on television, claiming that this would be re-recording her music before she is allowed to next year. They also blocked the use of her older music or performance footage in the upcoming Netflix film, she claimed. Swift alleged that Borchetta told her team she would only be allowed to use the music if she agreed ""not to re-record copycat versions"" next year and stopped talking about the two men. ""The message being sent to me is very clear. Basically, be a good little girl and shut up. Or you'll be punished,"" she wrote. She went on to ask her fans to help to pressure Braun and Borchetta into changing their minds and to appeal to the artists they manage for help. She also asked for help from the private equity firm The Carlyle Group, which she said financed the sale. Fans responded instantly, with the hashtags ""IStandWithTaylor"" and ""FreeTaylor"" trending on Twitter. Ina statement,external, the Big Machine Label Group said it had been optimistic about resolving the long-running dispute - until Swift posted her statement on Thursday. ""Despite our persistent efforts to find a private and mutually satisfactory solution, Taylor made a unilateral decision last night to enlist her fanbase in a calculated manner that greatly affects the safety of our employees and their families,"" the label said. In June, Scooter Braun (right) bought Big Machine, which Borchetta founded in 2005 ""Taylor, the narrative you have created does not exist. All we ask is to have a direct and honest conversation. When that happens, you will see there is nothing but respect, kindness and support waiting for you on the other side."" Big Machine also said: ""At no point did we say Taylor could not perform on the AMAs or block her Netflix special. In fact, we do not have the right to keep her from performing live anywhere."" It did not specifically address whether she could perform old songs. In response,the singer's publicist Tree Paine insisted,externalthat Borchetta ""flatly denied the request for both American Music Awards and Netflix"". Both sides also claim the other owes them millions of dollars. Borchetta founded Big Machine in 2005, and the company was bought by Braun's Ithaca Holdings in June. Stars including Halsey, Gigi Hadid and BBC Radio 1 DJ Greg James have leapt to the singer's defence. Fellow pop singer Halsey said: ""These people are protected because they inspire complicity with fear. ""Banking on the illusion that people will not stand up for her. That the world will say she is over-reacting, You're barking up the wrong tree. ""It is her grace and patience in these moments that make her artist of the decade,"" she added.

After Braun bought most of the US pop star's life's work, thanks to his acquisition of her former record label Big Machine for $300m (Â£237m) in June, Tim Ingham from Music Business Worldwidetold the BBCin July that these kind of contract arrangements were fairly common in the days before music streaming. ""Unfortunately for Taylor Swift, she started recording at a time in the history of the industry when it was still heavily reliant on radio, where you needed a record company backing to get you on radio, particularly country radio in Nashville, where Big Machine was a huge player,"" said Ingham. ""And also, you needed to rely on physical distribution to get your CDs into stores. So she needed a record company to invest the amount of money that they had to invest to get her career off the ground."" Mark Sutherland, editor of trade publication Music Week, agreed in July with Ingham that Braun's business decisions will most likely be driven by money. ""A lot of those songs are going to be a small goldmine in the streaming environment as they are enduring pop hits that are going to be streamed from now until the next 20, 30, 40 years.""

"This video can not be played These Hong Kong university students fought police on Tuesday with bows and arrows A man has died in Hong Kong after being hit on the head during clashes between government supporters and protesters. The government said the 70-year-old cleaner was on a lunch break on Wednesday when he was struck by ""hard objects hurled by masked rioters"". In London, Hong Kong's Justice Secretary Teresa Cheng was hurt after being jostled by anti-government protesters, the Chinese embassy said. Protests have rocked Hong Kong for months and violence is escalating. Ms Cheng is seen as having played a key role in promoting an unpopular bill allowing extradition to mainland China, which triggered the protests. China strongly condemned the incident and called for a thorough investigation. Chinese President Xi Jinping issued a strong warning to protesters. Speaking at a summit of BRICS countries in Brazil, he said ""radical violent activities"" in Hong Kong ""seriously challenged the [principle of] 'one country, two systems'"". The 70-year-old was hit in the head during a protest in the Hong Kong border town of Sheung Shui. Video purported to be of the incident shows two groups throwing bricks at each other before the man falls to the ground after being struck on the head. A police superintendent told news outlet SCMP that the cleaner was not involved, and was ""only taking pictures at the scene"". He died in hospital on Thursday. The Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) said the man was an outsourced worker of theirs who had been on his lunch break. Hong Kong in first recession for a decade Hong Kong protests explained in 100 and 500 words Hong Kong pushed to 'brink of total collapse' Hong Kong to close schools amid tense protests The FEHD also condemned the protesters,calling them ""extremely dangerous"".,external ""[They] conducted violent acts in various districts three days in a row, where they wantonly assaulted other members of the public,"" the statement added. ""The acts are outrageous."" Hong Kong has seen an escalation in violence this week, with intense street battles, violent clashes at universities, and flashmob lunchtime protests. On Monday, a police officer shot an activist in the torso with a live bullet, and a man was set on fire while arguing with anti-government protesters. A week ago, Alex Chow, a 22-year-old student, died after falling from a building during a police operation. Hong Kong has been rocked by violence for months Ms Cheng was in London to promote Hong Kong as a dispute resolution and deal-making hub. Video showed her walking towards a lecture at the Chartered Institute of Arbitrators when she was surrounded by a group of protesters. Some held signs and shouted ""murderer"" and in the melee, Ms Cheng fell to the ground. Ms Cheng fell to the ground during the melee She regained her feet and was escorted away with no visible signs of injury, AFP reported. A statement from the Chinese embassy in the UK said Ms Cheng had been pushed to the ground and sustained a hand injury. It said the incident showed ""violent and lawless perpetrators"" were now taking their violence abroad. London's Metropolitan Police told the BBC they were investigating an allegation of assault and no arrests had been made. ""A woman was taken to hospital by London Ambulance Service suffering an injury to her arm. Enquiries are ongoing to establish the full circumstances,"" a statement said. Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam also condemned the protesters,external, saying ""the savage act breached the bottom line of any civilised society"". Hong Kong - a British colony until 1997 - is part of China under a model known as ""one country, two systems"". Under this model, Hong Kong has a high degree of autonomy and people have freedoms unseen in mainland China. The protests started in June after the government planned to pass a bill that would allow suspects to be extradited to mainland China. Many feared this bill would undermine the city's freedoms and judicial independence. The bill was eventually withdrawn but the protests continued, having evolved into a broader revolt against the police, and the way Hong Kong is administered by Beijing. Protests have taken place every weekend over the past few months, causing widespread disruption.

"Towns such as Fishlake near Doncaster were hit hard by recent flooding Almost 10,000 new homes could be built on some of the most flood-prone areas of England, a Greenpeace investigation has found. They include hundreds of new-builds in Sheffield and Doncaster, the towns hit hardest by the latest floods. The Environment Agency told the BBC that virtually all planning applications last year followed its advice on flood risk. But it predicts the flooding risk will increase because of climate change. The Greenpeace study comes as hundreds of flood-hit homes in South Yorkshire and Derbyshire are still evacuated. It identifies plans to build a total of 9,688 new homes in high-risk areas. More than 5,000 homes have been proposed in high-risk zones of Lincolnshire, where roads and thousands of acres of farmland have been flooded in the last few days. The developments include Boston United Football Club's new 5,000-seater stadium. The research also highlighted a 3,100-home ""new town"" near Stainforth, less than two miles from Fishlake, the village where hundreds of people have been forced from their homes because of flooding. The project includes what has been described by developers as a ""marina"". These properties have not yet received full planning permission but have been ear-marked by the local authority for development. The Greenpeace study selected the 10 English councils with the highest percentage of land covered by high-risk areas using the Environment Agency's map. It then plotted these against sites that the councils listed in their five-year plans for housing supply. Sheffield and Doncaster were added after the recent flooding in those areas. The work found that, as well as hundreds of new homes in high-risk areas of these towns, thousands of homes are planned for medium-risk zones. Greenpeace's chief scientist Doug Parr said the decision was ""planning for disaster"" The Environment Agency defines a high-risk flood zone as one where there is a one in 100 chance of flooding in any given year. Medium-risk zones are areas where there is a one in 1,000 risk of flooding in any year. Greenpeace's chief scientist, Doug Parr, described the plans to build homes in areas at high risk of flooding as ""literally planning for disaster"". ""Flooding has been flashing on the radar as one of the major impacts of the climate emergency in the UK for years,"" he said, ""yet our planning system keeps failing to properly recognise it"". The Environment Agency told the BBC that local planning authorities are responsible for approving proposals for new development in their areas. However, it said the National Planning Policy Framework makes clear that inappropriate development in areas at risk of flooding should be avoided. ""In some places it will be challenging to avoid these areas,"" the Environment Agency statement said, ""due to limited land outside the flood plain or because of other sustainable development objectives."" Nevertheless, the agency claimed that, between 2017 and 2018, 99.4% of planning applications involving new homes were decided in line with its advice on flood risk. The Local Government Association told the BBC that the figure for 2018-19 was a bit lower, at around 97.3% .

"A worker applying a capping layer to a landfill site in Hangzhou China's largest dump is already full - 25 years ahead of schedule. The Jiangcungou landfill in Shaanxi Province, which is the size of around 100 football fields, was designed to take 2,500 tonnes of rubbish per day. But instead it received 10,000 tonnes of waste per day - the most of any landfill site in China. China is one of the world's biggest polluters, and has been struggling for years with the rubbish its 1.4 billion citizens generate. The Jiangcungou landfill in Xi'an city was built in 1994 and was designed to last until 2044. The landfill serves over 8 million citizens. It spans an area of almost 700,000 square metres, with a depth of 150 metres and a storage capacity of more than 34 million cubic metres. Until recently, Xi'an was one of the few cities in China that solely relied on landfill to dispose of household waste - leading to capacity being reached early. Earlier this month, a new incineration plant was opened, and at least four more are expected to open by 2020. Together, they are expected to be able to process 12,750 tonnes of rubbish per day. The move is part of a national plan to reduce the number of landfills, and instead use other waste disposal methods like incineration. The landfill site in Xi'an will eventually become an ""ecological park"". In 2017, China collected215 million tonnes of urban household waste,external, according to the country's statistical yearbook. That's up from 152 millionten years earlier.,external The country had 654 landfill sites and 286 incineration plants. It is not clear what China's recycling rate is, as no figures have been released. China plans to recycle 35% of waste in major cities by the end of 2020, according toone government report.,external This July, sorting and recycling rubbish was made mandatory in Shanghai - leading to""a sense of panic""among some residents. Social angst high as Shanghai gets tough on rubbish A blockage in global waste disposal In 2015, there was a landslide at a rubbish dump in the southern city of Shenzhen,killing 73 people. The dump was designed to hold four million cubic metres worth of rubbish, with a maximum height of 95 metres. When it collapsed, it was holding 5.8m cubic metres of material with waste heaps up to 160m high. One town in Malaysia was left swamped with foreign waste Not anymore. It used to, until the end of 2017 when it decided to ban the import of 24different grades of rubbish. In 2017 alone, China took in seven million tonnes of plastic rubbish from Europe, Japan and the US - and 27 million tonnes of waste paper. Other countries, including Malaysia, Turkey, the Philippines and Indonesia, have picked up some of the slack. Who's sending back plastic waste? The small town with a dirty secret Reality Check: Where is the plastic waste mountain? But they struggled to deal with the amount of waste coming in - often times resulting in massive, out-of-control landfills in their own countries.

"The Conservatives have pledged to reduce business rates for small firms in a bid to help ""left-behind"" towns, if they win the general election. Under their plans, they would also extend discounts on business rates to smaller cinemas and music venues. They are also offering to make it easier for local groups to buy community buildings such as post offices. But Labour said the Tories had destroyed High Streets and towns. The Conservatives have also promised Â£500m to reversecuts to the railway networkmade in the 1960sby Dr Richard Beeching, which affected smaller towns and villages, and a Â£350m fund for improving cycling infrastructure. Boris Johnson promised measures to help ""overlooked and left-behind"" towns, and help people ""put the heart back into the places they call home"". The Conservatives are battling with opposition parties for votes in marginal constituencies ahead of the 12 December general election. Struggling towns to get post-Brexit funding Historic towns to benefit from Â£95m boost named Labour pledges free broadband for all The party said that, if re-elected, it would increase the business rate discount available to smaller firms from 33% to 50% in 2020/21. It is also planning to introduce a new Â£1,000 business rates relief scheme for pubs, which it says amounts to an Â£18m tax cut next year. The changes to business rates would only apply to England.  Business rate regimes are set separately in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. If you want to make a retailer's blood boil, just say the words ""business rates"" and it usually does the trick. Many see the tax as an extra burden on them based on the size and value of their properties, no matter how well their businesses are doing. That feels tough when so many are already struggling to compete against competitors online. But if retailers were hoping to see some big changes or radical overhauls, they'll be disappointed. These promises from the Conservative party will be welcomed by those who would benefit - the smallest retailers, independent cinemas, and little local pubs. But they are relatively cheap give-aways, skirting round the edges of a tax which raised Â£31bn last year. Just two weeks ago the Treasury select committee released a report into what they described as the ""broken"" and ""unfair"" rates system. They challenged the government to take a serious look at alternative systems, which it seems the Conservatives are quietly side-stepping in this election. The Conservatives are also pledging to give community groups up to nine months - up from the current six - to buy buildings listed as 'assets of community value'. The groups will also be able to apply for cash from a Â£150m fund for helping with making bids for the designated buildings, such as post offices and pubs. Making the announcements, Mr Johnson said: ""For too long, too many towns and villages across Britain have been overlooked and left behind. ""When the UK voted to leave the EU in 2016, many communities felt their voices had been heard for the first time in decades and their lives would improve. ""We will invest in these communities and help people put the heart back into the places they call home. ""We need to get Brexit done so that we can unleash the potential of all our towns, cities and villages. ""We will be able to save our High Streets, keep pubs and post offices open and re-connect places to the rail network half a century after they were cut off.""

"There are 650 constituencies in the UK but most of the campaigning for the general election will take place in a smaller number. As ever, much of the focus will be on marginal constituencies - places where the winning majority in 2017 was small. However, at this election the parties will also be targeting a large number of constituencies beyond the marginal seats. There will be a lot of focus on areas that voted strongly to Leave or strongly to Remain in the EU referendum - even where the majorities are large. Big swings cannot be ruled out. A striking aspect of the2017 general electionwas that the result in lots of constituencies was very close. The normal working definition for a marginal seat is one where the majority is under 10%, which usually means under about 5,000 votes - although that does depend on turnout and the size of the constituency. Then, within that group of seats, there are the ultra-marginals: places where the majority is under 2% - about 1,000 votes. In 2017 there were 51 of these ultra-marginals - considerably more than in previous elections. In fact there were eight seats with a majority under 50. All those will be hotly contested. The Conservatives will be hoping to win back some of the seats they lost last time - likeCanterbury,external,Keighley,externalandKensington,external- while Labour will try to take seats where it got within a whisker - such asArfon,external,Pudsey,externalandSouthampton Itchen,external. And the Lib Dems will hope to win seats they've previously held likeRichmond Park,external,St Ives,externalandSheffield Hallam,external. In Scotland there are 46 marginal seats, using the 10% definition, out of a total of 59. So almost all the constituencies are potentially in play. Of particular interest will be the 21 seats lost by the SNP in 2017. Nearly all voted Remain in the EU referendum so the SNP hopes its anti-Brexit stance will help it to recapture as many of them as possible. In many cases it would only take a small shift - places likeStirling,externalandGordon,external, held by the Conservatives, andRutherglen & Hamilton West,externalandMidlothian,external, both held by Labour. Another seat to keep an eye on is Fife North East. It's the most marginal constituency in the whole country with an SNP majority over the Liberal Democrats of just two votes. In fact, that's the smallest majority in any seat this century. It's not just Scotland where Brexit will influence which seats are targeted. Strongly Leave and strongly Remain areas are likely to be crucial. The Conservatives are hoping to capture longstanding Labour constituencies that voted heavily to Leave - even those outside the normal marginal range. The map shows that these are concentrated in the Midlands and parts of the north of England - seats likeWest Bromwich West,external,Bolsover,external, andHyndburn,external. However, the Brexit Party has a similar goal. It describesHartlepool,externalas its number one target. On the other hand, the Liberal Democrats are targeting heavily-Remain seats, mostly in the south of England, even though some have quite big majorities. Places likeSt Albans,external,Winchester,external, andCambridge,external. Another feature of the Brexit battle at this election is the agreement made by the Liberal Democrats, Plaid Cymru and Green Party to stand aside for one another in 60 seats across England and Wales. It's impossible to know whether this will affect who wins any of the constituencies but it should give a boost to Plaid in places likeLlanelli,externalandYnys Mon,externaland to the Lib Dems in seats includingHazel Grove,externalandThornbury & Yate,external. Lib Dems, Greens and Plaid agree election pact Brexit Party will not stand in Tory seats Corbyn rules out election pacts with rival parties What is tactical voting? Where parties choose to put up candidates could have a bigger impact in Northern Ireland than anywhere else. InBelfast South,external, for example, Sinn Fein is standing aside in favour of the SDLP to increase its chances of ousting the DUP. The SDLP will return the favour in Belfast North. Meanwhile inFermanagh & South Tyrone,externalthe DUP will stand aside to assist the UUP, as it did in 2017. Another seat to keep an eye on isFoyle,externalwhere it's a different story. It's the most marginal constituency in Northern Ireland and was a Sinn Fein gain from the SDLP last time. One of the features of recent general elections has been Labour's increasing dominance in London. As a region it used to be fairly representative of the whole country, politically speaking, but over time that has changed. In 2017 Labour won 49 of the 73 seats across the city. There's also evidence that the effect has started to spill out from central London to the outskirts and to constituencies in the surrounding areas. That seems to be linked to an increase in the number of people leaving London - especially those in their 30s and 40s. Labour will be hoping that this demographic change could help it in seats likeChingford & Woodford Green,external,Crawley,external, andMilton Keynes South,external- all popular destinations for people leaving London.

"Natasha Ednan-Laperouse died in 2016 after eating a baguette containing hidden sesame The number of children being admitted to hospital in England with a severe allergic reaction has risen every year for the past five years. NHS figures show 1,746 children were treated for anaphylactic shock in 2018-19, up from 1,015 in 2013-14. The parents ofNatasha Ednan-Laperouse, who died in 2016 after eating a baguettecontaining sesame, called the increase ""deeply alarming"". Scientists say environmental factors could be to blame for more allergies. Children under 10 were most likely to be affected by anaphylaxis, with 1,018 admitted to hospital last year - compared with 601 in 2013-14. Why the world is becoming more allergic Teens treated for allergies up 65% in five years Family demand law change after Byron burger death Boy's cheese allergy death 'unprecedented' When adults with severe allergic reactions treated in hospital were also included, the figures rose from 4,107 cases to 5,497 over five years. Anaphylaxis,externalis a severe allergic reaction which can be life-threatening. The most common causes of severe allergic reactions are foods such as nuts, fish and shellfish but they can also be triggered by wasp and bee stings, drugs and dairy products, among others. Even the tiniest exposure to one of these allergens can be enough to set off an anaphylactic reaction and bring on breathing difficulties, rapid heartbeat and loss of consciousness. Sesame is one of 14 allergens consumers must be made aware of in food products The increase in allergies is not simply due to society becoming more aware of them and better at diagnosing them. Instead,scientists believe factors such as dietary changes, exposure to microbes and pollution may play a rolein the rise - particularly for Western lifestyles. An allergy expert has previously suggested that teenagers taking risks when managing their food allergies was likely to be a factorin the increase in severe allergic reactions in that age group. Natasha's mother, Tanya Ednan-Laperouse, said: ""These terrifying figures show we are facing an allergy emergency. ""The number of children with allergies and suffering severe allergic reactions is rising year-on-year at a deeply alarming rate."" Hasan Arshad, professor of allergy and clinical immunology at the University of Southampton, said the figures confirmed ""a worrying increase in severe food allergy"". ""We should not forget that behind each of these numbers is a child or adult who has suffered the most severe consequences of an anaphylactic shock,"" he said. This video can not be played New ingredient proposals: ""This will help so many allergy sufferers,"" say Nadim and Tanya Ednan-Laperouse Fifteen-year-old Natasha had a severe and fatal allergic reaction to an artichoke, olive and tapenade baguette bought from Pret a Manger. She was allergic to sesame seed but this was not listed on the product label. Despite her father, Nadim, administering two EpiPen injections, Natasha died in a hospital within hours. Natasha's parents have campaigned for a change in the law to require producers of pre-packed foods to list all their ingredients. This law will come into force in 2021. Up until now, takeaways and restaurants have had to let customers know only if any of the 14 most dangerous allergens - including peanuts, eggs and milk - are contained in their dishes. Natasha's parents have also set up theNatasha Allergy Research Foundation,external, with the ultimate aim of finding a cure for allergies.

"This video can not be played Nitrous oxide is sold in metal canisters often discarded in the street A trading standards expert has warned online stores need to ""take responsibility"" to prevent the illicit sale of nitrous oxide. The gas - dubbed ""laughing gas"" or ""nos"" - is being sold with equipment needed to take it as a high on sites like Amazon and eBay, BBC Wales found. It is the second most commonly used recreational drug in England and Wales after cannabis. Sales are tricky to police as it has legal uses in catering and pain relief. Nitrous oxide is sold on Amazon and eBay alongside the ""crackers"" and balloons used to take it. On social media sellers were happy to deliver around the clock. 'Don't be complacent over laughing gas risks' Laughing gas laws 'are not working' Arsenal to talk to players over nitrous oxide inhalation allegations Samantha - not her real name - used nos when she was younger after a housemate bought it on Amazon. The 22-year-old from Cardiff said: ""When you're that age and everyone around you is doing it, and you're not really seeing any bad, negative impacts from it, you think, 'Oh it's fine, it's something that young people do'."" But she experienced fizzing in her nose, nausea and a tight chest after taking a substance friends bought online. It was discovered being sold on eBay and Amazon They thought it was nos. It was CO2. Carbon dioxide is not used recreationally but inhaling it carries similar risks. ""The next day I felt really, really terrible, and I think it was a lot of anxiety about what I'd done the night before,"" Samantha said. ""It was something that turned me off doing anything like that because it was so scary."" Effects include euphoria, calmness, dizziness, difficulty thinking straight, giggling and hallucinations Inhaling nitrous oxide from the canister or in an enclosed space - like with a bag over your head - is very dangerous By inhaling nitrous oxide the user risks falling unconscious or suffocating from lack of oxygen. People have died this way If someone collapses after using nos, turn them on to their side, call 999 and stay with them until an ambulance arrives Source: Frank Nitrous oxide has been linked to 17 deaths in the last three years, according to official statistics. Among 16 to 24-year-olds about one in 11 used it last year. Legislation introduced in 2016 made it illegal to sell as a high. Prosecutors say the law is not working because its legal uses make enforcement tricky. How dangerous is laughing gas? BBC Wales found boxes of nos canisters being sold on Amazon in a special deal including the balloons used to take it. On eBay, some ""crackers"" were sold alongside balloons. There were money-saving deals on bulk purchases and nos canisters advertised in the ""similar sponsored items"" section. When BBC Wales searched for nitrous oxide canisters on both sites, crackers and balloons also came up in searches and were suggested by the sites' algorithms as products that could be bought with nos. The gas is often inhaled using balloons Amazon has since removed the product being sold as a package of nos canisters and balloons. The company said sellers must follow their guidelines. A spokesman said: ""Those who do not will be subject to action including potential removal of their account."" An eBay spokesman said: ""Listings encouraging illegal activity are banned from eBay's platform. ""We have removed the items and are taking enforcement action against the sellers."" Nitrous oxide is also sold through social media accounts. Many carry warnings against recreational use, but when a BBC Wales investigator called five sellers in Wales and south-west England, all were happy to deliver nos that night - despite the reporter saying it was for recreational use. Some offered discount deals for multiple boxes. Caerphilly council's Tim Keohane secured one of Wales' first prosecutions of a shop for illegally selling it in August. Caerphilly and Gwent Police prosecuted Khehra Store Ltd after it was found to have sold nos at the 7-11 shop in Bedwas Road, Caerphilly, in 2018. The firm and its boss were hit with fines and charges of about Â£2,000. Anyone found guilty of selling or giving away nitrous oxide for illegal purposes can face up to seven years in prison, an unlimited fine, or both. Nitrous oxide has been used recreationally since the early 1800s Mr Keohane said the offence was harder to prove with online vendors. They can flout the law by selling items separately or posting disclaimers against misuse. He said the drug's widespread use among the young and online sales were a ""huge concern"". But its legitimate uses - such as for producing whipped cream - made legislating against web distribution difficult. Mr Keohane said: ""Companies like Amazon and eBay need to take responsibility because it is so difficult to police the internet and sellers."" The Royal College of Nursing (RCN) has said many are unaware of the risks. They include breathing difficulties, increased heart rate, burns and death. Mental health nurse Jeremy Davis, of RCN Wales, said: ""For every young person who has a balloon at a party and has five minutes that are the best of their evening, there is another one who wakes up in A&E. ""There are four or five more [each year] who don't wake up."" In May, several 4ft cylinders were stolen from Prince Charles Hospital, Merthyr Tydfil. How dangerous is laughing gas?

"This video can not be played Josephine Frimpong recalled the moment she was told her son was dead The family of a 15-year-old boy who was stabbed to death after getting off a bus said he was a talented footballer with plans for his life. Baptista Adjei was found critically injured near Stratford Shopping Centre in east London on 11 October. His mother Josephine Frimpong said she was waiting for him to come home from school when she received a frantic call saying ""Baptista is dead"". A 15-year-old boy has been charged with murder. He also faces a charge of causing grievous bodily harm and two counts of possessing an offensive weapon. The schoolboy died after getting off a bus near Stratford Shopping Centre A second boy, also 15, has been charged with conspiracy to murder Baptista. Baptista, from North Woolwich, will be laid to rest in an east London cemetery later. Speaking about the moment she received the phone call, his mother said: ""They said 'Baptista is dead'. I said 'no, Baptista is not dead' and I'm running. ""I go outside and I'm crying a lot and later on I saw police cars coming."" Josephine Frimpong with her two sons Baptista (left) and David Ms Frimpong, who also has a 12-year-old son called David, said she was ""always missing Baptista in this house"". ""It's too much for me. I can't do anything,"" she said. ""When in the morning I wake up Dave, I go to wake up Baptista and I didn't see Baptista. I'm not happy at all, I feel... pains."" Mourners gathered at the location where Baptista was stabbed Baptista's aunt Elizabeth Ntiedu said he was a ""very loving boy"" and a talented footballer with plans for his life. ""He was a clever boy and he said 'I wanna be a footballer but I also want to educate myself'. He had potential,"" she added. Baptista's brother David said the siblings ""used to basically do everything together"". He said he took comfort by lying on his brother's bed where he would ""just say what I'm thinking"". David added: ""And I would say it to him when I'm alone. I feel like he's there. Sometimes it can be really hard, but I just know that he's in a better place.""

"The Conservatives have pledged to reduce business rates for small firms in a bid to help ""left-behind"" towns, if they win the general election. Under their plans, they would also extend discounts on business rates to smaller cinemas and music venues. They are also offering to make it easier for local groups to buy community buildings such as post offices. But Labour said the Tories had destroyed High Streets and towns. The Conservatives have also promised Â£500m to reversecuts to the railway networkmade in the 1960sby Dr Richard Beeching, which affected smaller towns and villages, and a Â£350m fund for improving cycling infrastructure. Boris Johnson promised measures to help ""overlooked and left-behind"" towns, and help people ""put the heart back into the places they call home"". The Conservatives are battling with opposition parties for votes in marginal constituencies ahead of the 12 December general election. Struggling towns to get post-Brexit funding Historic towns to benefit from Â£95m boost named Labour pledges free broadband for all The party said that, if re-elected, it would increase the business rate discount available to smaller firms from 33% to 50% in 2020/21. It is also planning to introduce a new Â£1,000 business rates relief scheme for pubs, which it says amounts to an Â£18m tax cut next year. The changes to business rates would only apply to England.  Business rate regimes are set separately in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. If you want to make a retailer's blood boil, just say the words ""business rates"" and it usually does the trick. Many see the tax as an extra burden on them based on the size and value of their properties, no matter how well their businesses are doing. That feels tough when so many are already struggling to compete against competitors online. But if retailers were hoping to see some big changes or radical overhauls, they'll be disappointed. These promises from the Conservative party will be welcomed by those who would benefit - the smallest retailers, independent cinemas, and little local pubs. But they are relatively cheap give-aways, skirting round the edges of a tax which raised Â£31bn last year. Just two weeks ago the Treasury select committee released a report into what they described as the ""broken"" and ""unfair"" rates system. They challenged the government to take a serious look at alternative systems, which it seems the Conservatives are quietly side-stepping in this election. The Conservatives are also pledging to give community groups up to nine months - up from the current six - to buy buildings listed as 'assets of community value'. The groups will also be able to apply for cash from a Â£150m fund for helping with making bids for the designated buildings, such as post offices and pubs. Making the announcements, Mr Johnson said: ""For too long, too many towns and villages across Britain have been overlooked and left behind. ""When the UK voted to leave the EU in 2016, many communities felt their voices had been heard for the first time in decades and their lives would improve. ""We will invest in these communities and help people put the heart back into the places they call home. ""We need to get Brexit done so that we can unleash the potential of all our towns, cities and villages. ""We will be able to save our High Streets, keep pubs and post offices open and re-connect places to the rail network half a century after they were cut off."" But Labour highlighted cuts to local councils, which the party said had hit the most deprived areas particularly hard. Shadow communities secretary Andrew Gwynne said: ""A decade of vicious cuts to the services that people in our communities rely on has taken 60p in every Â£1 from council budgets."" ""There is a clear choice in this election on 12 December: more of the same with Boris Johnson's Tories or real change and investment under Labour.""

"Kelly Mayhew died in 2015 after a botched operation A British woman convicted of killing a US patient by giving her botched buttock-enhancement injections has been sentenced to a year in New York jail. Donna Francis had pleaded guilty to criminally negligent homicide for the 2015 death of Kelly Mayhew after she was extradited from the UK in August. Francis was given the maximum sentence allowed in the extradition agreement. ""The phrase 'getting away with murder' certainly applies to you,"" New York Judge Kenneth Holder said on Thursday. ""If you have a conscience, this is going to haunt you much longer than the one-year sentence you're going to serve."" Francis, 39, who is originally from Loughton, Essex, was sentenced in the Queens Supreme Court in New York for causing the death of Mayhew in May 2015. At her sentencing, Francis was in tears, and said she regretted the incident. ""It wasn't my intention to hurt anyone,"" she said. ""I'm sorry for all the years this has been going on. I'm just sorry."" Mayhew and her mother had travelled to New York from Maryland to pay Francis - who has no medical licence - $1,600 (Â£1,200) for a buttock enhancement procedure. Mayhew went into cardiac arrest after the botched silicone injections were administered in the basement of a house. Her brother, who read a statement on behalf of their mother in court, said Francis had refused to call 911 or provide an address to give first responders,the New York Post reported,external. Mayhew eventually died from systemic silicone emboli, when the unencapsulated silicone entered her bloodstream and caused an embolism, the medical examiner found.

"Taylor Swift is in a dispute with Scooter Braun (centre) and Scott Borchetta Taylor Swift's former record label has rebuffed her claims it is blocking her from performing her own hits at the forthcoming American Music Awards. The singer said music executives Scooter Braun and Scott Borchetta would not let her perform songs from her past albums, which they own the rights to. She said a Netflix documentary about her life had also been put in jeopardy. Borchetta and Braun's Big Machine Records said Swift's statement was ""based on false information"". Swift v Braun: Personal or strictly business? Taylor Swift 'bullied' by man who now owns her music Swift made the allegations in a statement posted to Twitter with the caption: ""Don't know what else to do."" Allow Twitter content?

""Right now my performance at the AMAs, the Netflix documentary and any other recorded events I am planning to play until November 2020 are a question mark,"" she wrote. But in response, the label denied telling the pop superstar she could not perform at the AMAs or trying to block the Netflix special, and said the ""narrative you have created does not exist"". Swift is being named Artist of the Decade at this month's AMAs In June, Swift revealed thatthe masters of her early music had been sold to Braun by her former record label, run by Borchetta, and alleged that she was not told about it. At the time the singer accused Braun, who also manages Ariana Grande, Justin Bieber and Demi Lovato, of ""incessant, manipulative bullying"". Swift also accused Braun of attempting to ""dismantle"" her ""musical legacy"".,externalWhile he did not respond to her comments, he was supported by Lovato and Bieber, who claimed Swift was just out ""to get sympathy"". The singer confirmed in August that she planned to re-record music from her first six albums so she could own the rights to the new versions. Swift is set to be named Artist of the Decade at the AMAs later this month and said she had been planning to perform a medley of her hits. But in her statement on Thursday, she said the two men had blocked her from performing her old songs on television, claiming that this would be re-recording her music before she is allowed to next year. They also blocked the use of her older music or performance footage in the upcoming Netflix film, she claimed. Swift alleged that Borchetta told her team she would only be allowed to use the music if she agreed ""not to re-record copycat versions"" next year and stopped talking about the two men. ""The message being sent to me is very clear. Basically, be a good little girl and shut up. Or you'll be punished,"" she wrote. She went on to ask her fans to help to pressure Braun and Borchetta into changing their minds and to appeal to the artists they manage for help. She also asked for help from the private equity firm The Carlyle Group, which she said financed the sale. Fans responded instantly, with the hashtags ""IStandWithTaylor"" and ""FreeTaylor"" trending on Twitter. Ina statement,external, the Big Machine Label Group said it had been optimistic about resolving the long-running dispute - until Swift posted her statement on Thursday. ""Despite our persistent efforts to find a private and mutually satisfactory solution, Taylor made a unilateral decision last night to enlist her fanbase in a calculated manner that greatly affects the safety of our employees and their families,"" the label said. In June, Scooter Braun (right) bought Big Machine, which Borchetta founded in 2005 ""Taylor, the narrative you have created does not exist. All we ask is to have a direct and honest conversation. When that happens, you will see there is nothing but respect, kindness and support waiting for you on the other side."" Big Machine also said: ""At no point did we say Taylor could not perform on the AMAs or block her Netflix special. In fact, we do not have the right to keep her from performing live anywhere."" It did not specifically address whether she could perform old songs. In response,the singer's publicist Tree Paine insisted,externalthat Borchetta ""flatly denied the request for both American Music Awards and Netflix"". Both sides also claim the other owes them millions of dollars. Borchetta founded Big Machine in 2005, and the company was bought by Braun's Ithaca Holdings in June. Stars including Halsey, Gigi Hadid and BBC Radio 1 DJ Greg James have leapt to the singer's defence. Fellow pop singer Halsey said: ""These people are protected because they inspire complicity with fear. ""Banking on the illusion that people will not stand up for her. That the world will say she is over-reacting, You're barking up the wrong tree. ""It is her grace and patience in these moments that make her artist of the decade,"" she added. Supermodel Hadid tweeted: ""Scott and Scooter, you know what the right thing to do is."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

After Braun bought most of the US pop star's life's work, thanks to his acquisition of her former record label Big Machine for $300m (Â£237m) in June, Tim Ingham from Music Business Worldwidetold the BBCin July that these kind of contract arrangements were fairly common in the days before music streaming. ""Unfortunately for Taylor Swift, she started recording at a time in the history of the industry when it was still heavily reliant on radio, where you needed a record company backing to get you on radio, particularly country radio in Nashville, where Big Machine was a huge player,"" said Ingham. ""And also, you needed to rely on physical distribution to get your CDs into stores. So she needed a record company to invest the amount of money that they had to invest to get her career off the ground."" Mark Sutherland, editor of trade publication Music Week, agreed in July with Ingham that Braun's business decisions will most likely be driven by money. ""A lot of those songs are going to be a small goldmine in the streaming environment as they are enduring pop hits that are going to be streamed from now until the next 20, 30, 40 years.""

Baptista Adjei was found critically injured near Stratford Shopping Centre in east London on 11 October. His mother Josephine Frimpong said she was waiting for him to come home from school when she received a frantic call saying ""Baptista is dead"". A 15-year-old boy has been charged with murder. He also faces a charge of causing grievous bodily harm and two counts of possessing an offensive weapon. The schoolboy died after getting off a bus near Stratford Shopping Centre A second boy, also 15, has been charged with conspiracy to murder Baptista. Baptista, from North Woolwich, will be laid to rest in an east London cemetery later. Speaking about the moment she received the phone call, his mother said: ""They said 'Baptista is dead'. I said 'no, Baptista is not dead' and I'm running. ""I go outside and I'm crying a lot and later on I saw police cars coming."" Josephine Frimpong with her two sons Baptista (left) and David Ms Frimpong, who also has a 12-year-old son called David, said she was ""always missing Baptista in this house"".

Mourners gathered at the location where Baptista was stabbed Baptista's aunt Elizabeth Ntiedu said he was a ""very loving boy"" and a talented footballer with plans for his life. ""He was a clever boy and he said 'I wanna be a footballer but I also want to educate myself'. He had potential,"" she added. Baptista's brother David said the siblings ""used to basically do everything together"". He said he took comfort by lying on his brother's bed where he would ""just say what I'm thinking"".

"This video can not be played Nitrous oxide is sold in metal canisters often discarded in the street A trading standards expert has warned online stores need to ""take responsibility"" to prevent the illicit sale of nitrous oxide. The gas - dubbed ""laughing gas"" or ""nos"" - is being sold with equipment needed to take it as a high on sites like Amazon and eBay, BBC Wales found. It is the second most commonly used recreational drug in England and Wales after cannabis. Sales are tricky to police as it has legal uses in catering and pain relief. Nitrous oxide is sold on Amazon and eBay alongside the ""crackers"" and balloons used to take it. On social media sellers were happy to deliver around the clock. 'Don't be complacent over laughing gas risks' Laughing gas laws 'are not working' Arsenal to talk to players over nitrous oxide inhalation allegations Samantha - not her real name - used nos when she was younger after a housemate bought it on Amazon. The 22-year-old from Cardiff said: ""When you're that age and everyone around you is doing it, and you're not really seeing any bad, negative impacts from it, you think, 'Oh it's fine, it's something that young people do'."" But she experienced fizzing in her nose, nausea and a tight chest after taking a substance friends bought online. It was discovered being sold on eBay and Amazon They thought it was nos. It was CO2. Carbon dioxide is not used recreationally but inhaling it carries similar risks. ""The next day I felt really, really terrible, and I think it was a lot of anxiety about what I'd done the night before,"" Samantha said. ""It was something that turned me off doing anything like that because it was so scary."" Effects include euphoria, calmness, dizziness, difficulty thinking straight, giggling and hallucinations Inhaling nitrous oxide from the canister or in an enclosed space - like with a bag over your head - is very dangerous By inhaling nitrous oxide the user risks falling unconscious or suffocating from lack of oxygen. People have died this way If someone collapses after using nos, turn them on to their side, call 999 and stay with them until an ambulance arrives Source: Frank Nitrous oxide has been linked to 17 deaths in the last three years, according to official statistics. Among 16 to 24-year-olds about one in 11 used it last year. Legislation introduced in 2016 made it illegal to sell as a high. Prosecutors say the law is not working because its legal uses make enforcement tricky. How dangerous is laughing gas? BBC Wales found boxes of nos canisters being sold on Amazon in a special deal including the balloons used to take it. On eBay, some ""crackers"" were sold alongside balloons. There were money-saving deals on bulk purchases and nos canisters advertised in the ""similar sponsored items"" section. When BBC Wales searched for nitrous oxide canisters on both sites, crackers and balloons also came up in searches and were suggested by the sites' algorithms as products that could be bought with nos. The gas is often inhaled using balloons Amazon has since removed the product being sold as a package of nos canisters and balloons. The company said sellers must follow their guidelines. A spokesman said: ""Those who do not will be subject to action including potential removal of their account."" An eBay spokesman said: ""Listings encouraging illegal activity are banned from eBay's platform. ""We have removed the items and are taking enforcement action against the sellers."" Nitrous oxide is also sold through social media accounts. Many carry warnings against recreational use, but when a BBC Wales investigator called five sellers in Wales and south-west England, all were happy to deliver nos that night - despite the reporter saying it was for recreational use. Some offered discount deals for multiple boxes. Caerphilly council's Tim Keohane secured one of Wales' first prosecutions of a shop for illegally selling it in August. Caerphilly and Gwent Police prosecuted Khehra Store Ltd after it was found to have sold nos at the 7-11 shop in Bedwas Road, Caerphilly, in 2018. The firm and its boss were hit with fines and charges of about Â£2,000. Anyone found guilty of selling or giving away nitrous oxide for illegal purposes can face up to seven years in prison, an unlimited fine, or both. Nitrous oxide has been used recreationally since the early 1800s Mr Keohane said the offence was harder to prove with online vendors. They can flout the law by selling items separately or posting disclaimers against misuse. He said the drug's widespread use among the young and online sales were a ""huge concern"". But its legitimate uses - such as for producing whipped cream - made legislating against web distribution difficult. Mr Keohane said: ""Companies like Amazon and eBay need to take responsibility because it is so difficult to police the internet and sellers."" The Royal College of Nursing (RCN) has said many are unaware of the risks. They include breathing difficulties, increased heart rate, burns and death. Mental health nurse Jeremy Davis, of RCN Wales, said: ""For every young person who has a balloon at a party and has five minutes that are the best of their evening, there is another one who wakes up in A&E. ""There are four or five more [each year] who don't wake up."" In May, several 4ft cylinders were stolen from Prince Charles Hospital, Merthyr Tydfil. How dangerous is laughing gas?

"This video can not be played Nitrous oxide is sold in metal canisters often discarded in the street A trading standards expert has warned online stores need to ""take responsibility"" to prevent the illicit sale of nitrous oxide. The gas - dubbed ""laughing gas"" or ""nos"" - is being sold with equipment needed to take it as a high on sites like Amazon and eBay, BBC Wales found. It is the second most commonly used recreational drug in England and Wales after cannabis. Sales are tricky to police as it has legal uses in catering and pain relief. Nitrous oxide is sold on Amazon and eBay alongside the ""crackers"" and balloons used to take it. On social media sellers were happy to deliver around the clock. 'Don't be complacent over laughing gas risks' Laughing gas laws 'are not working' Arsenal to talk to players over nitrous oxide inhalation allegations Samantha - not her real name - used nos when she was younger after a housemate bought it on Amazon. The 22-year-old from Cardiff said: ""When you're that age and everyone around you is doing it, and you're not really seeing any bad, negative impacts from it, you think, 'Oh it's fine, it's something that young people do'."" But she experienced fizzing in her nose, nausea and a tight chest after taking a substance friends bought online. It was discovered being sold on eBay and Amazon They thought it was nos. It was CO2. Carbon dioxide is not used recreationally but inhaling it carries similar risks. ""The next day I felt really, really terrible, and I think it was a lot of anxiety about what I'd done the night before,"" Samantha said. ""It was something that turned me off doing anything like that because it was so scary."" Effects include euphoria, calmness, dizziness, difficulty thinking straight, giggling and hallucinations Inhaling nitrous oxide from the canister or in an enclosed space - like with a bag over your head - is very dangerous By inhaling nitrous oxide the user risks falling unconscious or suffocating from lack of oxygen. People have died this way If someone collapses after using nos, turn them on to their side, call 999 and stay with them until an ambulance arrives Source: Frank Nitrous oxide has been linked to 17 deaths in the last three years, according to official statistics. Among 16 to 24-year-olds about one in 11 used it last year. Legislation introduced in 2016 made it illegal to sell as a high. Prosecutors say the law is not working because its legal uses make enforcement tricky. How dangerous is laughing gas? BBC Wales found boxes of nos canisters being sold on Amazon in a special deal including the balloons used to take it. On eBay, some ""crackers"" were sold alongside balloons. There were money-saving deals on bulk purchases and nos canisters advertised in the ""similar sponsored items"" section. When BBC Wales searched for nitrous oxide canisters on both sites, crackers and balloons also came up in searches and were suggested by the sites' algorithms as products that could be bought with nos. The gas is often inhaled using balloons Amazon has since removed the product being sold as a package of nos canisters and balloons. The company said sellers must follow their guidelines. A spokesman said: ""Those who do not will be subject to action including potential removal of their account."" An eBay spokesman said: ""Listings encouraging illegal activity are banned from eBay's platform. ""We have removed the items and are taking enforcement action against the sellers."" Nitrous oxide is also sold through social media accounts. Many carry warnings against recreational use, but when a BBC Wales investigator called five sellers in Wales and south-west England, all were happy to deliver nos that night - despite the reporter saying it was for recreational use. Some offered discount deals for multiple boxes. Caerphilly council's Tim Keohane secured one of Wales' first prosecutions of a shop for illegally selling it in August. Caerphilly and Gwent Police prosecuted Khehra Store Ltd after it was found to have sold nos at the 7-11 shop in Bedwas Road, Caerphilly, in 2018. The firm and its boss were hit with fines and charges of about Â£2,000. Anyone found guilty of selling or giving away nitrous oxide for illegal purposes can face up to seven years in prison, an unlimited fine, or both. Nitrous oxide has been used recreationally since the early 1800s Mr Keohane said the offence was harder to prove with online vendors. They can flout the law by selling items separately or posting disclaimers against misuse. He said the drug's widespread use among the young and online sales were a ""huge concern"". But its legitimate uses - such as for producing whipped cream - made legislating against web distribution difficult. Mr Keohane said: ""Companies like Amazon and eBay need to take responsibility because it is so difficult to police the internet and sellers."" The Royal College of Nursing (RCN) has said many are unaware of the risks. They include breathing difficulties, increased heart rate, burns and death. Mental health nurse Jeremy Davis, of RCN Wales, said: ""For every young person who has a balloon at a party and has five minutes that are the best of their evening, there is another one who wakes up in A&E. ""There are four or five more [each year] who don't wake up."" In May, several 4ft cylinders were stolen from Prince Charles Hospital, Merthyr Tydfil. How dangerous is laughing gas?

"Meetings at work should be seen as a form of ""therapy"" rather than about decision-making, say researchers. Academics from the University of Malmo in Sweden say meetings provide an outlet for people at work to show off their status or to express frustration. Professor Patrik Hall says they are becoming increasingly frequent - as more managerial and ""strategy"" jobs generate more meetings. But he says despite there being more meetings ""few decisions are made"". Prof Hall has investigated an apparent contradiction in how people can have a low opinion of work meetings, yet their numbers keep increasing. The political scientist says the rise in meetings reflects changes in the workforce - with fewer people doing and making things and an increase in those involved in ""meetings-intense"" roles such as strategists, advisers, consultants and managers. ""People don't do concrete things any more,"" he says. Instead he says there has been a rise of managerial roles, which are often not very well defined, and where ""the hierarchy is not that clear"". Emails while commuting should count as work Self-promoters at work 'do nothing but still get ahead at work' ""Many managers don't know what to do,"" he says, and when they are ""unsure of their role"", they respond by generating more meetings. ""People like to talk and it helps them find a role,"" says the professor. Many of these people can spend half of their working hours in meetings, he says. Managers uncertain about their purpose will generate more meetings These can spill over into pre- and post-meetings, to such an extent that people might begin to ""disguise"" how much time they spend attending them. Prof Hall, who has co-authored a book on meetings, gives the example of the Swedish border police, who describe their overseas meetings as ""power weeks"". Meetings can ""arouse feelings of meaninglessness"", he says. But he argues that is often missing their point. Once in a meeting - particularly long ones - their function can become ""almost therapeutic"". Meetings - a chance to catch up on messages on the mobile Regardless of what they are meant to be discussing, they serve a purpose as an ""opportunity to complain and be acknowledged by colleagues"". But people going to many meetings can lose patience - and can spend much of the time playing with their mobile phones, say the researchers. Prof Hall says as a result, meetings can become ""maligned somewhat unnecessarily"". ""Some people find this frustrating and question why they must endure them."" But he argues that negativity towards meetings can be because their real purposes are misunderstood. Many regular, internal meetings might seem entirely ""pointless"" to those taking part, says Prof Hall. But he says the real purpose of such meetings might be to assert the authority of an organisation, so that employees are reminded that they are part of it. Such meetings are not really about making any decisions, he says. Prof Hall suggests booking rooms for shorter periods, as he says meetings will expand to fill whatever time is given to them. He also says that ""equality"" of participants is important. ""When you have meetings with colleagues at the same level, as a professional, you get to discuss different issues that interest you,"" he says. When the meetings are dominated by different levels of status, they become a ""power struggle"" and leave participants feeling frustrated. He also says that meetings can unfairly become the focus of other dissatisfactions. ""People often feel marginalised. They feel that they have no influence or position. In these cases, the perception is that meetings do not improve anything, but actually cause even more frustration.""

"Alibaba chief executive Daniel Zhang has praised Hong Kong's ""bright"" future as the Chinese e-commerce giant prepares to list in the embattled financial hub. The firm, which is already traded in the US, hopes to raise up to $13.4bn (Â£10.4bn) in its secondary listing. That would make it the biggest share sale this year, according to Dealogic. The move is seen as a boost for Hong Kong, diluting fears that protests have tarnished its financial reputation. The city has grappled with anti-government protests for nearly five months andviolent clashes escalated this week. ""During this time of ongoing change, we continue to believe that the future of Hong Kong remains bright,"" Alibaba Chairman Daniel Zhang said. He described the city as ""one of the world's most important financial centres"". Mr Zhang - whosucceeded Jack Ma to take Alibaba's top jobearlier this year - said the company hoped to ""contribute"" to the future of Hong Kong. The company will offer 500 million shares, priced at up to HK$188 ($24) each for retail investors. Shares are due to start trading on 26 November. The sale could knock Uber off the top spot as this year's biggest IPO, according to Dealogic data. The ride-sharing firm raised $8.1bn in its New York float in May. Over the years, Alibaba has grown from an online marketplace into an e-commerce giant with interests ranging from financial services to artificial intelligence. The company said the new listing will allow investors across Asia to ""participate in Alibaba's growth,"" as it seeks to tap ""substantial new capital pools"" in the region. Alibaba Singles' Day shopping frenzy breaks record The Hangzhou-based firm had originally considered a Hong Kong IPO in 2013, but opted for New York after failing to secure regulatory approval in the Asian territory. The move to go ahead with the share sale in Hong Kong comes after Alibaba reportedly delayed plans to list there earlier this year, amid ongoing unrest and the US-China trade war. The long-running protests havehurt the economy, which has fallen into recession, andknocked business confidencein the city. Death confirmed during Hong Kong unrest A quick guide to the Hong Kong protests Hong Kong protests hit Burberry and Cathay Pacific The protests started in June against plans to allow extradition to the mainland - which many feared would erode the city's freedoms. Hong Kong is part of China, but as a former British colony it has some autonomy and people have more rights. While the extradition plans were withdrawn in September, the demonstrations have continued, with protesters calling for an independent inquiry into alleged police brutality, and democratic reform.

"This video can not be played These Hong Kong university students fought police on Tuesday with bows and arrows A man has died in Hong Kong after being hit on the head during clashes between government supporters and protesters. The government said the 70-year-old cleaner was on a lunch break on Wednesday when he was struck by ""hard objects hurled by masked rioters"". In London, Hong Kong's Justice Secretary Teresa Cheng was hurt after being jostled by anti-government protesters, the Chinese embassy said. Protests have rocked Hong Kong for months and violence is escalating. Ms Cheng is seen as having played a key role in promoting an unpopular bill allowing extradition to mainland China, which triggered the protests. China strongly condemned the incident and called for a thorough investigation. Chinese President Xi Jinping issued a strong warning to protesters. Speaking at a summit of BRICS countries in Brazil, he said ""radical violent activities"" in Hong Kong ""seriously challenged the [principle of] 'one country, two systems'"". The 70-year-old was hit in the head during a protest in the Hong Kong border town of Sheung Shui. Video purported to be of the incident shows two groups throwing bricks at each other before the man falls to the ground after being struck on the head. A police superintendent told news outlet SCMP that the cleaner was not involved, and was ""only taking pictures at the scene"". He died in hospital on Thursday. The Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) said the man was an outsourced worker of theirs who had been on his lunch break. Hong Kong in first recession for a decade Hong Kong protests explained in 100 and 500 words Hong Kong pushed to 'brink of total collapse' Hong Kong to close schools amid tense protests The FEHD also condemned the protesters,calling them ""extremely dangerous"".,external ""[They] conducted violent acts in various districts three days in a row, where they wantonly assaulted other members of the public,"" the statement added. ""The acts are outrageous."" Hong Kong has seen an escalation in violence this week, with intense street battles, violent clashes at universities, and flashmob lunchtime protests. On Monday, a police officer shot an activist in the torso with a live bullet, and a man was set on fire while arguing with anti-government protesters. A week ago, Alex Chow, a 22-year-old student, died after falling from a building during a police operation. Hong Kong has been rocked by violence for months Ms Cheng was in London to promote Hong Kong as a dispute resolution and deal-making hub. Video showed her walking towards a lecture at the Chartered Institute of Arbitrators when she was surrounded by a group of protesters. Some held signs and shouted ""murderer"" and in the melee, Ms Cheng fell to the ground. Ms Cheng fell to the ground during the melee She regained her feet and was escorted away with no visible signs of injury, AFP reported. A statement from the Chinese embassy in the UK said Ms Cheng had been pushed to the ground and sustained a hand injury. It said the incident showed ""violent and lawless perpetrators"" were now taking their violence abroad. London's Metropolitan Police told the BBC they were investigating an allegation of assault and no arrests had been made. ""A woman was taken to hospital by London Ambulance Service suffering an injury to her arm. Enquiries are ongoing to establish the full circumstances,"" a statement said. Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam also condemned the protesters,external, saying ""the savage act breached the bottom line of any civilised society"". Hong Kong - a British colony until 1997 - is part of China under a model known as ""one country, two systems"". Under this model, Hong Kong has a high degree of autonomy and people have freedoms unseen in mainland China. The protests started in June after the government planned to pass a bill that would allow suspects to be extradited to mainland China. Many feared this bill would undermine the city's freedoms and judicial independence. The bill was eventually withdrawn but the protests continued, having evolved into a broader revolt against the police, and the way Hong Kong is administered by Beijing.

"Zipporah Kuria: ""They've robbed us of our closure"" Zipporah Kuria was fighting back tears. Eight months after the Boeing 737 Max crash that killed Ms Kuria's father, Joseph Waithaka, the site of impact was covered on Thursday and unidentified remains of the victims were buried in rows of identical coffins. But Ms Kuria wasn't there. Officials from Boeing and Ethiopian Airlines are believed to have attended a ceremony at the site, but because of the short notice Ms Kuria and other relatives of the dead were unable to attend. Family members of three separate victims told the BBC they were only notified of the ceremony days ago. As a result, only relatives of two of the 157 victims attended. ""It is absurd. It makes me shudder that Boeing and Ethiopian Airlines are at my father's funeral and I'm not,"" Ms Kuria said. What went wrong in the 737 Max cockpit? Boeing accused of building 'flying coffins' The crash happened in a rural area to the south-east of the Ethiopian capital, Addis Ababa. It left behind a deep crater which until this week still contained accident debris and some human remains. Families of those killed say they were left horrified after they visited the site last month and found that recent rains had uncovered bones and other items. Some, they said, were floating in flood water in the crater. Rows of coffins were placed neatly in the crater Ethiopian Airlines flight ET302 was lost minutes after take-off on what should have been a routine flight from Addis Ababa to the Kenyan capital Nairobi on 10 March. It came down in farmland, in a deeply rural area. In the immediate aftermath, those human remains that could be found were removed, along with the plane's flight recorders and large items of wreckage. The crash is believed to have occurred after a flight control system known as MCAS deployed at the wrong time, forcing the nose of the aircraft down when the pilots were trying to gain height. A similar malfunction has been blamed for the loss of a near-identical 737 Max in Indonesia a year ago. The aircraft has been grounded for the past nine months, banned from flying by aviation authorities around the world. 157 people died when Ethiopian Airlines flight 302 crashed The violence of the impact of the Ethiopian Airlines flight meant that when my colleagues and I visited the site in May, there was still a great deal of smaller debris lying in the fields. The deep impact crater itself remained, alongside huge mounds of earth from the recovery operation, with a rough wooden fence the only barrier to access. Animals were able to roam freely across the site. There were no guards and no official presence. After that, the victims' relatives say, the situation worsened as a result of seasonal rains. They have been demanding action. Samya Rose Stumo was 24 years old and was on board ET302 Nadia Millieron, whose daughter Samya Rose Stumo died in the crash, recently told the BBC: ""There were bones being revealed all the time and local people are coming to the site and covering them. We want Ethiopian Airlines to move the piles of earth into the crater, take the unidentifiable remains into the crater and to cover everything"". Ethiopian Airlines, which is managing the site, told victims' families it was aware of the issue, but claimed insurance issues had prevented it from taking action. But after coming under pressure from the relatives, and following an investigation by the BBC, it appears those difficulties have now been overcome. On Thursday, rows of coffins were placed neatly in the crater. These contained remains that had previously been removed for forensic analysis, but which could not be identified due to contamination. Then they were covered over and the crater itself was filled, the dark earth matching the surrounding fields. The site is now a permanent grave. 'My entire family died in 737 Max crash' Boeing 'doesn't understand our grief' Relatives of the victims believe Ethiopian Airlines had a duty to keep them informed about the burial and should have given them more notice. The BBC has approached the carrier for a comment. Boeing has refused to comment on reports that one of its senior executives, Jennifer Lowe, was among those present. The company said in a statement: ""We continue to offer our deepest sympathies to the families and loved ones of the victims of Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 and Lion Air Flight 610 and we are committed to helping those affected by these tragedies."" Last month, Ms Kuria travelled with her family to Ethiopia to collect and bring home some of her father's remains. She said it was ""heartbreaking"" that she was unable to get to the site in time for the covering of the site. ""My dad is being buried, well most of him, as we only received a small amount of him back,"" she said. She said she would have jumped on a flight if it had been possible. ""They've robbed us of our closure,"" she said.

"The Conservatives have pledged to reduce business rates for small firms in a bid to help ""left-behind"" towns, if they win the general election. Under their plans, they would also extend discounts on business rates to smaller cinemas and music venues. They are also offering to make it easier for local groups to buy community buildings such as post offices. But Labour said the Tories had destroyed High Streets and towns. The Conservatives have also promised Â£500m to reversecuts to the railway networkmade in the 1960sby Dr Richard Beeching, which affected smaller towns and villages, and a Â£350m fund for improving cycling infrastructure. Boris Johnson promised measures to help ""overlooked and left-behind"" towns, and help people ""put the heart back into the places they call home"". The Conservatives are battling with opposition parties for votes in marginal constituencies ahead of the 12 December general election.

It is also planning to introduce a new Â£1,000 business rates relief scheme for pubs, which it says amounts to an Â£18m tax cut next year. The changes to business rates would only apply to England.  Business rate regimes are set separately in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. If you want to make a retailer's blood boil, just say the words ""business rates"" and it usually does the trick. Many see the tax as an extra burden on them based on the size and value of their properties, no matter how well their businesses are doing. That feels tough when so many are already struggling to compete against competitors online. But if retailers were hoping to see some big changes or radical overhauls, they'll be disappointed. These promises from the Conservative party will be welcomed by those who would benefit - the smallest retailers, independent cinemas, and little local pubs. But they are relatively cheap give-aways, skirting round the edges of a tax which raised Â£31bn last year. Just two weeks ago the Treasury select committee released a report into what they described as the ""broken"" and ""unfair"" rates system. They challenged the government to take a serious look at alternative systems, which it seems the Conservatives are quietly side-stepping in this election. The Conservatives are also pledging to give community groups up to nine months - up from the current six - to buy buildings listed as 'assets of community value'. The groups will also be able to apply for cash from a Â£150m fund for helping with making bids for the designated buildings, such as post offices and pubs. Making the announcements, Mr Johnson said: ""For too long, too many towns and villages across Britain have been overlooked and left behind. ""When the UK voted to leave the EU in 2016, many communities felt their voices had been heard for the first time in decades and their lives would improve. ""We will invest in these communities and help people put the heart back into the places they call home. ""We need to get Brexit done so that we can unleash the potential of all our towns, cities and villages. ""We will be able to save our High Streets, keep pubs and post offices open and re-connect places to the rail network half a century after they were cut off."" But Labour highlighted cuts to local councils, which the party said had hit the most deprived areas particularly hard. Shadow communities secretary Andrew Gwynne said: ""A decade of vicious cuts to the services that people in our communities rely on has taken 60p in every Â£1 from council budgets."" ""There is a clear choice in this election on 12 December: more of the same with Boris Johnson's Tories or real change and investment under Labour.""
