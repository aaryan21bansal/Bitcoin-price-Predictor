"This video can not be played Cars frozen in floodwaters in Revere, Massachusetts North America's East Coast is shivering in a record-breaking freeze in the wake of a deadly ""bomb cyclone"" that dumped snow as far south as Florida. In parts of US and Canada, temperatures were forecast to fall below -20F (-29C), with wind chill making it feel more like -90F (-67C) on Friday night. In Canada, high winds have knocked out power for tens of thousands of residents in Nova Scotia. Thousands of snow ploughs are clearing roads across the US East Coast. The extreme weather has so far been linked to up to 19 deaths in the US and two more in Canada, according to reports. Four deaths were reported in traffic accidents in North and South Carolina. Further fatalities occurred in Wisconsin, Kentucky and Texas. Travellers at New York's JFK airport reported chaos at terminals on Friday and Saturday, and hours-long waits in aircraft stranded waiting for a gate. One passenger tweeted to say people were calling the police and threatening to break the doors open after hours waiting aboard a flight from Montreal. Allow Twitter content?

Amid the chaos at JFK, two passenger jets collided early on Saturday, according to officials from the Port Authority, which manages the airport. The right wing of a China Southern plane struck the tail of a Kuwait airliner. Both aircraft were damaged but no injuries were reported. In a separate incident,two planes collided at Toronto's Pearson airport late on Friday night, sparking a fire on one aircraft and requiring passengers to evacuate via emergency slides in the cold. The frozen Hudson River in New York City on America's East Coast Residents of Boston, Massachusetts, clear the streets after heavy snowfall The record-breaking cold comes just days after a phenomenon described as a ""bomb cyclone"" brought heavy snowfall to a wide area along the US East Coast, as well as hurricane-force winds. The National Weather Service (NWS) said on Saturday it expected dangerously low temperatures to last into Monday, as an arctic surge brought freezing air down from the North North Pole. ""An arctic outbreak will keep temperatures 20F to 30F degrees below average across the north-eastern US,"" the NWS said, adding that there was a ""chance for many daily temperature records to be broken"". Watch: What caused the US storm? New Hampshire's Mount Washington, which boasts of having the ""world's worst weather"", experienced record low wind-chill temperatures of -90F (-67C) on Friday night. In Massachusetts, residents of Boston, which received over 1ft (30cm) of snowfall, were clearing the streets with shovels. Boston harbour's tide gauge matched its record at 15.1ft - previously set during the great blizzard of 1978. Flooding affected the city's newly renovated seaport district and deluged a downtown subway station, and giant waves saw freezing floodwaters inundate parts of the New England coast. Mayor Marty Walsh blamed climate change. ""If anyone wants to question global warming, just see where the flood zones are,"" he said. Temperatures were forecast to plunge below -20F (-29C) in parts The storm has so far forced hundreds of schools and businesses to close in New York City, Philadelphia, Boston, the Carolinas, Maryland and Virginia. Panicked New York City residents rushed to shops before the snow came, clearing shelves of milk, eggs, and kale, the New York Times reported. The weather pattern has already brought snow to the US South as far down as Florida, wherethe cold snap has caused iguanas to lose their grip and fall from trees. Natural gas prices in the US north-east have risen to an all-time high, driven by demand for heating fuel. In Philadelphia, a car was unable to stop at a railway line at the bottom of a steep hill and was hit by a commuter train, killing a passenger in the vehicle. In Virginia, a girl was fatally struck by a car while sledging, and a 75-year-old man was killed after being hit by a snow plough. A 13-year-old girl died and 35 others suffered carbon-monoxide poisoning in an apartment building in Perth Amboy, New Jersey, where the temperature averaged 20F (-7C) on Thursday night. Seven of those treated were first responders.

"New car sales fell for the first time in six years last year, with demand for diesel cars plunging by almost a fifth. In total, there were about 2.5 million cars registered, according to industry body the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT). The figure was down 5.7% from 2016, while diesel sales fell 17.1% as higher taxes and pollution fears hit demand. CO2 emissions from new cars increased for the first time in 20 years, up 0.8% on 2016. SMMT chief executive Mike Hawes said the drop in diesel sales was ""the prime cause"" of the rise in CO2 emissions and that the latest low-emission diesels were ""vital"" in meeting climate change targets. He said he expected car sales to continue to drop this year, predicting a 5% to 7% fall. What's gone wrong in the UK car market? Car sales: six charts that tell a story How toxic is your car exhaust? What does the diesel change mean for you? Mr Hawes blamed the sales fall on declining business and consumer confidence, but pointed out last year's performance followed two years of record sales. ""We need to put it into context. This was still the third best year in a decade and the sixth best ever,"" he added. Mr Hawes said that confusion about the future of diesel had fuelled a backlash against diesel cars. Diesel vehicles produce the overwhelming majority of nitrogen oxide gases coming from roadside sources. It's fair to say the steep decline in demand for diesel cars is causing both frustration and consternation within the motor industry. The industry needs to sell diesels, because they are generally more fuel-efficient than petrol cars and therefore produce less carbon dioxide. That helps car companies to meet targets for reducing CO2, introduced in order to combat climate change. But concern about the level of nitrogen oxides (NOx)  they produce has made them a favourite target for clean air campaigners. The industry talks about a short-sighted backlash against new technology, which is encouraging people to stick with older, dirtier cars - and preventing sales of newer, cleaner models. But it's worth remembering where the backlash against diesel really began:with the VW scandal. It didn't just expose deliberate wrongdoing at one company, it also showed how many diesel cars, which had passed official tests, were routinely producing much higher levels of toxic emissions when driven on the roads. So you could argue that carmakers really have themselves to blame. Diesel car sales fell by almost a third in December afterNovember's Budget which introduced a levy on new diesel carsthat failed to meet the latest emissions standards. Experts said the one-off tax increase - which comes into effect in April - would be applied to most new diesels. Mr Hawes said that for many drivers, diesel was still ""the best bet because they can save a lot of money and indeed have a lower CO2 emission"". ""The backlash against diesel has made it far harder for us - and the government - to meet our climate change targets,"" he said. A government spokesperson said: ""Our ambitious Clean Growth Strategy sets out the UK's position as a world-leader in cutting carbon emissions to combat climate change while driving economic growth. ""This includes investing nearly Â£1.5bn in accelerating the rollout of ultra-low emission vehicles by 2020 - generating business opportunities and leading to cleaner air and lower greenhouse gas emissions."" Sales of alternatively fuelled vehicles, including electric and hybrid vehicles, saw a rise of 34.8% to almost 120,000. Environmental campaigner Tony Juniper told the BBC's Today programme that demand for electric cars was increasing ""at a rate that's defying predictions that were being made five or 10 years ago"". ""Partly this is being driven by the kinds of awareness around air pollution, but also climate change,"" he added. However, Mr Hawes told the programme that while electric cars were seen as the future, they still accounted for a very small proportion of total sales. Out of the 2.5 million vehicles sold in the UK in 2017, just 13,500 were battery electric, he said. ""It's growing, it's growing rapidly, but you can see the scale of the challenge,"" he added.

"This video can not be played Erdogan clashes with a reporter over arms supplies to Syria French President Emmanuel Macron has told his Turkish counterpart, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, that there is no chance of progress towards Turkey joining the European Union at present. At a joint news conference in Paris, Mr Macron said there were differences over human rights since Turkey's purges following a failed coup in 2016. Mr Erdogan said Turkey was tired of constantly imploring to join the EU. He lashed out at a journalist who asked about claims Turkey sent arms to Syria. The journalist had asked him abouta story in Cumhuriyet newspaper from 2015 which suggested that Turkish intelligence had sent the supplies. Mr Erdogan responded by accusing the journalist of talking like a member of the Gulenist movement, which he blames for the 2016 coup. ""When you ask your questions, be careful on this point. And do not speak with the words of another,"" he said. Erdogan: Turkey's pugnacious president Is Turkey still a democracy? Mr Macron said it was time to end the hypocrisy of pretending that there was any prospect of an advance in Turkey's membership talks with the EU. The two leaders promised to deepen their co-operation in the fight against terrorism ""As far as the relationship with the European Union is concerned, it is clear that recent developments and choices do not allow any progression of the process in which we are engaged,"" he said. The talks were in effect halted following Mr Erdogan's crackdown after the coup. But the French president also said it was important to keep a close relationship with Ankara, and that perhaps this was the moment to explore an option short of full EU membership  - a partnership, as he described it, that would anchor the Turkish people in Europe. Mr Erdogan has for some time poured scorn on EU overtures towards Turkey,accusing the bloc of being insincere and wasting Ankara's time.He has said that most Turks ""did not want the EU any more"". Both men hailed co-operation in the fight against the Islamic State group.

"Theodore Johnson had already killed two women when he attacked ex-girlfriend Angela Best A man who killed three former partners has been jailed for a minimum of 26 years. Theodore Johnson, 64, beat and throttled ex-girlfriend Angela Best after she met another man. He already had two manslaughter convictions. He pushed his wife off a ninth-floor balcony in 1981 and strangled a former partner in 1993. Johnson met Ms Best while on unescorted leave from a secure mental hospital. He beat her with a claw hammer and strangled her with her dressing gown cord at his north London home on 15 December 2016. Their relationship had recently ended after she met someone else. Triple killer admits murdering ex-partner Probe call over triple partner killer Sentencing, Judge Richard Marks QC said: ""The attack by you on Angela Best was sustained, vicious and utterly brutal. She suffered an unimaginably terrible death."" ""Such repeated offending, resulting in three separate court cases, must be almost unprecedented,"" he added. Hours after attacking Ms Best, 51, the garage worker threw himself in front of an express train. He survived but lost his right arm and left hand. Police only discovered Ms Best's body when they called at Johnson's flat in Islington to find his next of kin after the incident at Cheshunt railway station, in Hertfordshire. In mitigation for Johnson, Annette Henry QC said: ""He does not wish to be alive. He hates himself for what happened."" The killer, who now uses a wheelchair,pleaded guilty to murdering the mother-of-four and grandmother on the first day of his trial on Tuesday. Johnson had a personality disorder and depression, and was sent to a secure mental hospital after his second conviction. Johnson successfully applied for a conditional discharge from the hospital in October 1997. He was released on the condition he would tell doctors and social workers about any new relationships with women. However, he kept his relationship with Ms Best a secret. Records from his supervisors show four occasions in the 10 years before the murder when Johnson denied having any relationships with women since leaving hospital in 1997, the court heard. Johnson was sent to a secure hospital indefinitely in 1993 but was released in 1997 In 1981, Johnson was jailed for three years after killing his wife, Yvonne Johnson. He hit her over the head with a vase during a row before pushing her off the balcony of their home in a Wolverhampton tower block. The argument started when Mrs Johnson would not let her husband go to church because he was ""not dressed well enough"", it was reported at the time. He was cleared of murder but convicted of manslaughter by provocation. The judge described Johnson as a ""battered husband"" who had suffered violence at the hands of his wife. Yvonne Johnson was hit on the head and thrown off a balcony by her husband In 1993, he pleaded guilty to manslaughter, on the grounds of diminished responsibility, after attacking former partner Yvonne Bennett. He had met her in Wolverhampton after his release from prison for killing Mrs Johnson. They moved to north London and had a daughter together, but separated after Ms Bennett had an affair. She had sought police help to get him to leave their Finsbury Park home in the days before her death. He strangled her with a belt as their two-year-old daughter slept. Johnson phoned police to confess, tried to hang himself from a tree and then gave himself up, prosecutors said at the time. He was sent to a secure hospital indefinitely but released four years later. Valerie Archibold, left, and Lorraine Jones, right, paid tribute to their sister outside court Ms Best's sister, Lorraine Jones, said her heart went out to the other families who have suffered from Johnson's ""evil and calculated"" actions. She added that Ms Best ""doted"" on her four children and grandchildren, loved them ""dearly"" and was the ""heartbeat of our family"". Ms Best's son, Raphael Best, said the death of his ""kind"" mother was ""slowly driving me crazy"". On the morning she was murdered Ms Best had gone to Johnson's home to help him prepare for an appointment with the Jamaican embassy. In his victim impact statement, he added: ""My mother was the type of person who was always going out of her way to help people and unfortunately that was the reason she met her demise."" This video can not be played 'I predicted Johnson would kill again' A former healthcare assistant of Johnson, Sandra Davis, said he should never have been discharged from hospital. Campaigner Julian Hendy, of Hundred Families, said there were""serious questions"" to be answered about why Johnson was able to kill for a third time. Dr Jane Monckton-Smith, a forensic criminologist, told BBC's Woman's Hour: ""There are many others out there who have killed more than one partner. It's not as unusual as we would hope."" ""When we start to take domestic abuse seriously, then we will start reducing homicides,"" she added.

"Jon Venables was 10 when he and Robert Thompson killed James Bulger Jon Venables, one of the killers of toddler James Bulger nearly 25 years ago, has been charged over indecent images of children. The 35-year-old, who served eight years for the murder of James, aged two, in 1993, was recalled to prison last year. He and Robert Thompson abducted, tortured and killed the toddler in Liverpool when they were both aged 10. They were released on licence in 2001, meaning they can be recalled to jail at any time if they breach the conditions. Both were given new identities and reporting restrictions mean that Venables' current name, or anything else that could lead to his identification, will remain secret when his case is heard. On 12 February 1993, James - just a few weeks short of his third birthday - was reported missing by his mother from outside a butcher's shop in the New Strand Shopping Centre in Bootle. CCTV images showed him being lured away by Venables and Thompson. His body was found two days later on a railway line. He had been partially stripped and beaten to death with bricks and a metal bar. Thompson and Venables were arrested and charged within days and convicted in November of the same year at Preston Crown Court. James Bulger was two when he was abducted and killed in 1993 In 2001, the pair were released on licence from secure children's homes - and granted lifelong anonymity with new identities. In September 2008, Venables was arrested on suspicion of affray after a drunken brawl and was given a formal warning by the probation service for breaching the good behaviour terms of his licence. Later the same year he was cautioned for possession of cocaine after he was found with a small amount of the Class A drug. And in 2010, Venables was sent back to jail for two years after pleading guilty to charges of downloading and distributing indecent images of children and breaching his parole conditions by visiting Merseyside. He was released again in 2013 with a second new identity. When news of the 35-year-old's latest arrest emerged last year, James's mother Denise Fergus said: ""Venables has now proved beyond any doubt what a vile, perverted psychopath he has always been."" The Attorney General launched an investigation into claims his identity had been revealed on social media. In 2013, two men who posted images they claimed were of Venables and Thompson were given nine-month sentences, suspended for 15 months. Breaking the injunction that bans identifying the pair carries a punishment of up to two years in prison. A CPS spokesman said: ""The man formerly known as Jon Venables has been charged with offences relating to indecent images of children. ""In order that justice can be done, no further details are being released at this stage and the proceedings are subject to reporting restrictions.""

"John Worboys was jailed in 2009 for a string of sex attacks on women in his taxi The chairman of the Parole Board has apologised ""unreservedly"" that some victims of sex attacker John Worboys were not told about his release. The former black-cab driver served ten years after being convicted of 19 offences, including one rape, although police believe he attacked many more. The CPS said 83 complaints were made during the initial investigation, but many did not pass the evidential test. A number of victims' groups have condemned his release. Parole Board chairman Nick Hardwick said hearing the decision must have been ""horrible"" for the women, but the board was ""confident"" 60-year-old Worboys would not reoffend. He said the fact some victims were not informed was a fault with the parole system, but the decision itself would have been carefully considered. Prof Hardwick is to be summoned before the House of Commons Justice Committee to explain how the decision was reached and why some victims had not been informed. ""We look at a whole range of evidence - both what happened in the original offences, the judge's sentencing remarks, the programmes or work a prisoner has done, reports from people who know the prisoner well,"" he said. ""So we look at a whole range of evidence in coming to our decision. And we have to be confident that someone won't reoffend before we release them. And that's what the panel would have done in this case."" The CPS said Sir Keir Starmer did not have ""any involvement"" in Worboys' case. He had faced questions over the release as he was director of public prosecutions at the time of Worboys' trial. Why was he released from indefinite term? This video can not be played Parole Board Chair apologises ""unreservedly"" Worboys' victims didn't know of release The committee's chairman Bob Neill said what had happened was ""very disturbing"" and it was ""vital that the public has confidence in Parole Board decisions"". London Mayor Sadiq Khan, who called on the Parole Board to reconsider its decision, said: ""Too often victims are at best treated as an afterthought, or ignored altogether and this seems to have happened again in this case."" The Met Police revealed in 2010 that 19 other victims had come forward in the wake of Worboys's conviction. Officers suspected he had attacked more than 100 women between 2002 and 2008. These allegations were investigated, but no further action was taken on the advice of the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS), police said. In a statement, the Metropolitan Police added that ""all 19 complainants were notified."" In October 2010, the CPS said in a statement: ""We have seen no new material since the trial and we actually considered somewhere between 35 and 40 case files at the time."" BBC home affairs correspondent Danny Shaw said it was ""far from clear that the Met Police ever asked the CPS to make further charging decisions"". Sir Keir Starmer said it was important any fresh complaints were made to the police Speaking outside his home on Friday, Sir Keir Starmer said that if anybody felt allegations they had made had not been sufficiently investigated they should ""go to the police"". When asked whether he thought the right decision was made by prosecutors, the shadow Brexit secretary said only the Crown Prosecution Service could provide ""an accurate readout of the decisions that were made"". Black cab rapist: ""I screamed at him to get off me"" Sex attack victims sue cabbie John Worboys and his insurers Worboys police were 'overworked',external As BBC home affairs correspondent Danny Shaw explains, Parole Board members are kept busy. Last year they dealt with 500 cases each week, most of which were considered ""on the papers"", in other words by reading documents and reports about a prisoner. But in the most serious cases, involving about 7,000 inmates, they held oral hearings. These enable the parole panel to question the prisoner who is seeking release and form a judgment about whether they are prepared for life beyond bars, committed to reform their ways and able to be safely managed in the community. To help them make that assessment, panels usually take evidence from prison and probation staff and psychologists who have examined the offender. A representative of the justice secretary will make a submission and the offender's victims are allowed to read out a statement. Parole members will also have spent time scrutinising dozens of files detailing the prisoner's offending history, the trial judge's sentencing remarks and a record of their progress in jail. This video can not be played Solicitor: My client is ""absolutely horrified"" at the news that Worboys will be released One of Worboys's victims told BBC News she was unaware that his parole hearing had been successful and he was due to be let out. And Harriet Wistrich, a lawyer who represents two of Worboys's victims, said neither woman had received a letter to inform them the convicted rapist would be released. She said one of the women felt she should not have had to ""receive the news and see his face everywhere while cooking tea for her children"". Responsibility for informing victims about Worboys's release rested with the National Probation Service. The Ministry of Justice said some victims had chosen not to be updated about the case while others decided to be informed by letters which would have taken some time to arrive. ""Our priority is to support victims and it is right that we respect their decisions about how they are contacted,"" a spokesperson said. Some victims were sent a letter informing them of the Parole Board's decision The ruling by the Parole Board - which examines the cases of prisoners in England and Wales - has sparked outrage among victims' support groups. The charity Rape Crisis described Worboys's period of incarceration as ""woefully short"" for such a ""dangerous and manipulative perpetrator"". Lisa Thompson, from the Rape and Sexual Violence Project charity, said the decision was ""a massive failure of women who courageously went to the police in the first place and had then gone to court"". Specialist abuse lawyer Richard Scorer, whose firm represented 11 of the victims, said the Parole Board must reveal whether ""manipulative"" Worboys ""has finally admitted his crimes and shown any remorse"". Chair of the House of Commons Home Affairs Committee Yvette Cooper has called for the Parole Board to publish its decisions, although Prof Hardwick said the board was forbidden by law from disclosing such details. A cross party group of 58 MPs has also written to the Secretary of State for Justice David Lidington calling for investigation into whether the voices of Worboys's victims were heard during the decision to release him. This video can not be played Former solicitor general tells Today the parole board will have assessed rationally John Worboys Prof Hardwick said he wanted to make the Parole Board's decisions more transparent and he would ""welcome the backing of MPs to do that"". But he said a consultation was required first ""as it was not straightforward process"". Worboys told his victims he had won the lottery and invited them to celebrate with him Worboys, a former stripper from Rotherhithe, south-east London, targeted young women who had been drinking in the West End of London After deceiving them with a ruse that he had won the lottery, he produced champagne and a carrier bag stuffed with cash, before inviting them to celebrate with him. But the alcohol was laced with powerful sedatives, and once the drugs had taken hold he attacked the women in the back of his cab. Worboys was convicted in 2009 of 19 charges of drugging and sexually assaulting 12 passengers and one charge of rape. He was given an indeterminate sentence of imprisonment for public protection (IPP) and told he would not be released until parole officials were convinced he did not pose a threat to women. Worboys wasordered to serve at least eight years in jail,external. When he is released from prison later this month he will have spent a decade in custody, including a period on remand. IPP sentences were abolished in 2012 after it emerged that they were being used more widely than intended, but the decision was not applied retrospectively to more than 6,000 IPP prisoners - including Worboys - who were behind bars at that time. Malcolm Fowler, a retired solicitor with 48 years' experience, said Worboys ""would be anything but a free man"" on his release from prison. The 60 year old will be subject to licence conditions including weekly reporting to his supervisor. Any breach of his conditions could lead to his recall to prison. Why was Worboys released now?

"Victims' groups and charities have condemned the decision to free sex attacker John Worboys on parole after serving 10 years in prison. But was that decision, in part, a story of unintended consequences? Following his 2009 conviction of 19 offences including one count of rape, the former black-cab driver, who is believed to have carried out more than 100 rapes and sexual assaults on women, was given an indeterminate sentence for public protection - known as IPP. These sentences were introduced in 2005. At that time the criminal justice system faced a worrying problem. Some dangerous and prolific violent and sex offenders were nearing the end of their determinate sentences. They manifestly remained a danger to the public, but had to be released. The IPP was designed to deal with that problem. Worboys parole head apologises to victims Indefinite jail terms 'unlawful' Under it an offender is given a minimum term for the offence they commit, but will not be released unless they can demonstrate they are no longer a danger to the public. It was envisaged that it would be used to deal with a small number of dangerous offenders. However, it rapidly became clear that the courts were sentencing thousands of offenders to IPPs - some with minimum terms as low as 10-18 months. The IPP became known as the new or de facto ""life sentence"" and the prospects of parole for many of those serving them were slim. Courses and treatment within prison to address offending behaviour were not always available, so many offenders remained in prison, clogging up the system, long beyond the expiry of their minimum term. Cue a sea change. Once it became clear that IPPs were being overused and in some cases for low level offences, the pendulum swung. Campaigners pushed for a change and ministers responded.IPPs were abolished in 2012and pressure built to deal with the backlog of the thousands who remained in custody on them. In 2016-17, 576 were released. That represented some 46% of those on IPPs who applied for parole. No one can say what bearing, if any, this change had in John Worboys's case. What is clear is that those in prison on IPPs who have served their minimum term, are now being released in large numbers.

"Jeremiah Regis-Ngaujah died in November 2016 The brutal murder of a two-year-old boy by his stepfather could not have been predicted, a review has found. Chevaze McGregor, 27, struck Jeremiah Regis-Ngaujah at his Wolverhampton home citing his Christian faith as the reason for physical punishment. He was jailed for life in June. A so-called ""exorcism ritual"" Jeremiah's mother underwent when four months pregnant was only seen by council officials after a video was published by a national newspaper. Wolverhampton Safeguarding Children's Board has made a number of recommendations,externalto authorities and agencies involved, but said the ""severe level of violence"" Jeremiah suffered could not have been predicted. Midlands Live: Two women die in major crash on M42; Wooden plate restaurant fined Â£50,000 Jeremiah, described as a ""smiley, happy toddler... who enjoyed hugs"", died in November 2016 from multi-organ failure after his abdominal injuries caused septic shock. He had been hit with a rod and a belt causing more than 100 injuries. Chevaze McGregor was jailed for life in June and must serve a minimum of 21 years During proceedings, Birmingham Crown Court heard he was left ""broken and battered"" by McGregor, who inflicted numerous injuries, including a skull fracture, broken ribs and a bite wound. He had defensive wounds to his hands and arms, which showed he tried to shield himself from the beatings. McGregor told investigating officers his strong Christian beliefs meant he believed it was necessary to use physical punishment when Jeremiah misbehaved. Evidence of his explosive temper was captured on film and shown in court. The review said the boy's mother Sindyann Regis, 25, and grandmother also had strong religious beliefs. Regis underwent the ""exorcism ritual"" by a London pastor, although she and the other family members described it as being ""prayed over"", or a deliverance, rather than an exorcism. ""All the adults in this family had strong religious beliefs... there is no evidence that Child G [Jeremiah] was subject to violence by Mother's Partner because of these kinds of beliefs,"" the report said. Regis was jailed for three years and four months for allowing her son's death. Hersentence was cut on appeal to two years four monthsafter judges ruled it ""too long"". She arrived as a migrant in the UK from the Caribbean in 2003 and lived in London with her grandmother. She met McGregor at a Pentecostal church when she was about seven months pregnant. This case does raise concerns about the professional curiosity of the many staff from different agencies who knew Jeremiah and his mum Sindyann. Somehow they failed to realise that Chevaze McGregor had become involved in their lives and presented a danger to them both. If social workers had known they may have been able to intervene. It also raises questions about Wolverhampton. Five young children killed in less than 10 years. Nothing similar has happened in the neighbouring Black Country authorities, which are similar in size and make up. Is it just bad luck? Or is there a more serious problem with the way children are cared for in the city? In 2014 she was given accommodation in Wolverhampton at the same time a second application to remain in the UK was submitted to the Home Office, but returned to a London hospital for the birth a few weeks later. McGregor ""effectively moved in with the family"" in September 2016, two months before Jeremiah's death. The report said Regis told a midwife she did not want to return to her partner's home in London because he was controlling and she was scared of him. Sindyann Regis admitted a charge of causing or allowing the death of a child The midwife reported this to the community midwife and GP. They also highlighted other claims Regis had made previously to social workers in Croydon about alleged domestic abuse by an ex-partner, but this was not kept in her health records. The review also said information was not passed on quickly enough to authorities in Wolverhampton after Regis had moved. It said the city's children's services did not know the family had moved there for several months as the information was not passed on by authorities in Croydon. The Wolverhampton Multi-Agency Safeguarding Hub had also concluded there were ""no safeguarding concerns"" for them. Recommendations in the serious case review include calling for improvements in how information is gathered around domestic abuse and gaining a better understanding of the needs of families who do not have leave to remain in the UK. Linda Sanders, independent chair of Wolverhampton Safeguarding Children Board, said the recommendations had been accepted. ""We are also ensuring that learning from this review is widely disseminated so that we can reduce the likelihood of this tragic situation ever being repeated,"" she said. Di Smith, chair of Croydon Safeguarding Children Board, said the report had given the board ""the opportunity to reflect on the services we deliver to families and children"". ""We will implement the recommendations relating to our local safeguarding children board,"" she added. Four serious case reviews have been published since 2008 after an adult took a child's life in Wolverhampton: Ryan Lovell-Hancox died in December 2008 from a brain injury he received at Christopher Taylor and Kayley Boleyn's home in Bilston. They were jailed for murder and child cruelty in July 2010 Daniel Jones, 23 months, died from a heroin overdose in 2012. He collapsed at a house in Penn. Hair samples revealed the presence not only of heroin, but also amphetamines, cocaine and cannabis. His parents were jailed in 2013 Rebecca Kandare died in January 2014 after being found malnourished and having one of the worst cases of rickets seen in a UK infant. Her parents Brian and Precious Kandare, from Wednesfield, failed to seek urgent medical care for her because of their religious beliefs and were jailed in 2015 Joshua Millinson died after being shaken by his father, Daniel Sanzone.

He added: ""What fun it will be to watch Bafta 2018 without my heart hammering, mouth drying and knees trembling."" Bafta thanked him for making the awards ""such memorable and joyous occasions"". A replacement will be named on Tuesday, when this year's nominees are revealed.

He set the tone with his first opening monologue in 2001, which began: ""My lords, ladies and gentlemenâ¦ and Americans... It is my privilege, my pleasure, my erotic destiny, to welcome you all here."" He warned the gathered celebrities that year: ""Winners of awards are, of course, completely free to break down and cry during their acceptance speeches - but do bear in mind that I am also free to vomit."" The following year, his innuendo-laden script - including introducing Orlando Bloom as an actor who ""under my stern tutelage and carefully positioned guiding hand found stardom as a rent boy in Wilde"" - led the Daily Mail to accuse him of ""dragging the Baftas into the gutter"". His knowingly overblown prose was legendary, such as this in 2006: ""Let the tiara of joy encircle your brow, and the elastic pantyhose of festivity engirdle your most intimate parts. Comb out the dandruff of despair, and brush in the stardust of dreams. Unroll the red carpet through your hearts, my best of darlings, and tread the flowers of love into its loose but practical weave."" Stephen Fry hosting the Baftas in (left-right) 2002, 2003 and 2005 Stroking his beard in 2013, he remarked: ""I've a very strong feeling that I'm not the only actor who's come here this evening with a beard."" In 2015, he provoked criticism when he imitated the voice of Professor Stephen Hawking, who had presented an award. ""That was really super,"" Fry remarked in a robotic voice. After establishing a tradition of persuading an A-list star to pucker up with him, he introduced the Kiss Cam in 2016. The pairs of celebrities that appeared in shot had to kiss - including Dame Maggie Smith and Leonardo DiCaprio. Also in 2016, he sparked criticism again when he said best costume winner Jenny Beavan had come as a ""bag lady"".

"The Freemasons have been accused of proving an obstacle to reform at the Police Federation The leader of the Freemasons in England has rejected claims the organisation is blocking reform in the police service. David Staples, chief executive of the United Grand Lodge of England, said it was ""laughable"" to suggest Freemasons were interfering with its culture. Earlier this week, former leader of the Police Federation Steve White accused Freemasons of preventing women and minority groups from progressing. Dr Staples insisted Freemasons had a history of treating people ""as equals"". He wrote toThe Times,externalandGuardian,externalto deny allegations the organisation was blocking reforms intended to encourage women, black people and those from ethnic minority groups to become national representatives in the federation, which represents rank-and-file officers in England and Wales. He said Freemasons themselves were ""quite openly discriminated against"" and insisted it was for that reason alone that many Freemasons kept their membership a secret. In his letter Dr Staples, who is an NHS clinical director, said Freemasons were ""quietly proud"" of welcoming people ""as equals"". Secret ceremonies and rituals of female Freemasons Would you want to be a Freemason? He said: ""The idea that reform within the Police Federation or anywhere else is being actively thwarted by an organised body of Freemasons is laughable"". He said there was ""absolutely no reason"" police officers, or people from other walks of life, should not belong to the Freemasons. Earlier Mr White, who served as chairman from 2014 to 2017, remarked to the BBC andGuardian,externalthat a ""small pocket of people"" had been opposed to the reforms. Steve White said the perception Freemasons were obstructing reform was ""damaging"" He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""Whether it was coincidence or not, I don't know, but certainly a fairly high proportion - that isn't reflective of policing - seem to be Freemasons."" He added: ""Even if it wasn't the case, the perception was damaging.""

"Most of those penalised were sanctioned for taking mobile phones into exams More students are cheating in GCSE and A-level exams in England, with the number caught last summer up a quarter on the previous year, new figures show. Exam boards issued 2,715 penalties to students for malpractice in 2017 against 2,180 in 2016, Ofqual said. Most were penalised for taking mobile phones into the exam, while just under a fifth were pulled up for plagiarism. The rise in cheating came as new tougher GCSEs in English and maths were introduced for the first time. Exams regulator Ofqual, which published the figures, describes malpractice as any breach of the rules which might undermine the integrity of an exam. It also covers any attempt by students to communicate with each other during exams, as well as the failure of a school or college to follow exam board instructions. The failure by staff to follow rules around controlled assessments and coursework, is covered, as well as the conduct of examinations. There was also an increase in the number of school and college staff penalised for malpractice. Ofqual issued 890 penalties to staff in 2017 compared with 360 the previous year. Four in 10 student penalties were for taking unauthorised items, mainly mobile phones, into the exam room. Plagiarism was the second most common form of malpractice, with 86% of this occurring in maths and computing exams. Most students, 1,235, were penalised with the loss of marks. Some 635 students were given a warning and 490 had their papers scrapped. Liberal Democrat education spokesperson Layla Moran said: ""This is an extremely worrying trend in our exam halls and throws into question whether the current assessment process is even fit for purpose."" She said it was the impact of a system which puts enormous pressure on teachers and students, ""making them feel like they will succeed or fail based on only a few hours of narrowly focused, high stakes exams"".

"Only iPhones and Macs running the very latest operating system software are safe from the Meltdown bug Apple has said that all iPhones, iPads and Mac computers are affected by two major flaws in computer chips. It emerged this weekthat tech companies have been racing to fix the Meltdown and Spectre bugs, that could allow hackers to steal data. Billions of PCs, smartphones and tablets around the world are affected - Apple has now confirmed its products are too. The firm has released some patches to mitigate the Meltdown flaw. It said there was no evidence that either vulnerability had been exploited yet, but advised downloading software only from trusted sources to avoid ""malicious"" apps. Mac users have often believed that their devices and operating systems are less vulnerable to security issues than, for example Android phones or computers running Microsoft systems. This video can not be played Watch: Chip hacks explained The Meltdown and Spectre flaws are found in many modern computer processing units - or microchips - designed by Intel and ARM, and together the firms supply almost the entire global computer market. Meltdown and Spectre: How chip hacks work Computer chip scare: What home users need to know ""All Mac systems and iOS devices are affected, but there are no known exploits impacting customers at this time,""Apple said in blog post on the issue.,external ""These issues apply to all modern processors and affect nearly all computing devices and operating systems."" Apple said it had already released ""mitigations"" against Meltdown in its latest iPhones and iPad operating system update - iOS 11.2  and the macOS 10.13.2 for its MacBooks and iMacs. Meltdown does not affect the Apple Watch, it said. Patches against Spectre, in the form of an update to web browser Safari, will be released ""in the coming days"". Google and Microsoft have already issued statements telling users which products are affected by the bugs. Google,externalsaid its Android phones - which make up more than 80% of the global market - were protected if users had the latest security updates. And Microsofthas already released fixes for many of its services.,external Windows users should be aware that third-party anti-virus software may need to be updated before applying operating system patches. Security researcher Kevin Beaumont ismaintaining an online list of anti-virus products,externalthat have been updated. Guidance from US cyber-security project CERT, which is funded by the federal government, originally advised computer users that in order to fully remove the vulnerability they would have to ""replace"" processor hardware. It has nowchanged that advice,externalto say users should ""apply updates"" to mitigate any attacks instead. As the severity of the microchip flaws affecting billions of devices became clear, news broke that Intel's chief executiveBrian Krzanich sold off 245,000 of his shares,externalin the firm in October. This was at a time when Intel knew about Meltdown and Spectre, but before the issues had become public. ""Brian's sale is unrelated,"" said Intel in a statement.

"Grant Shapps was Tory chairman between 2012 and 2015 The Conservative Party should ""come clean"" about how many members it has, its former chairman has said. Grant Shapps said ""transparency"" on membership numbers was vital even if the figure appeared to be ""embarrassing"". The party last published figures in 2013, when it had 149,800 members but has refused to publish an update since then. Activists and academics have estimated it has fallen to 100,000, or less. That would make the Conservatives the fourth largest party in the UK, behind Labour, the SNP and the Liberal Democrats, according to politics professor and party membership expert Tim Bale, assuming their rivals have ""held above 100,000"". Labour's membership has surged to more than 500,000 under Jeremy Corbyn and the SNP and Lib Dems have also seen increases in recent years, although the SNP, with an estimated 118,000 members, have slipped back slightly from their post-independence referendum peak. The Conservative Party said it did not comment on membership figures. Mr Shapps said David Cameron had ""taken some convincing"" to release the figures at the end of 2013. The then Tory leader believed it would be a ""difficult and embarrassing figure to publish"", said Mr Shapps, who was party chairman at the time. But the Tory MP said he had argued, in a written submission to Mr Cameron, that it would be ""embarrassing not to publish the figures and it will help us increase the membership - and it did"". Mr Shapps said ""coming clean about membership is step number one"" in rebuilding the Conservative Party's campaigning strength ahead of the next general election. He said prospective members had to be given a reason to join the party - and he called for them to be given a say in policy formation, as they were in the Lib Dems and Labour. He also argued for the post of party chairman, currently held by Sir Patrick McLoughlin, to be made an elected position. Tories 'urgently need more volunteers' The Tories seeking young voters John Strafford, of the Campaign for Conservative Democracy, said he had heard from local party sources that the membership could be as low as 70,000, although a Tory source has told the BBC it is ""substantially higher"" than that, without saying what it was. Mr Strafford said a full picture would not emerge until March when people had renewed their subscriptions. He said more than half of local associations had fewer than 100 members - and he warned that if nothing was done to make members feel more involved ""Labour will wipe the floor with us at the next general election"". Apost-mortem on the party's 2017 general election campaign,external, by former cabinet minister, Sir Eric Pickles, called for urgent action to increase membership and the party has said it is ""in the process of taking forward his recommendations"". Labour- About 552,000 as of June 2017 Conservatives- About 149,800 as of December 2013 Scottish National Party- About 118,000 as of August 2017 Liberal Democrats- About 103,000 as of September 2017 Green Party of England and Wales- 55,500 as of March 2017 UK Independence Party- 39,000 as of July 2016 Plaid Cymru- About 8,300 as of 2017 Source:House of Commons Library briefing from September 2017,external Some Tory activists have expressed concern about the party's membership profile, aftera report by Tim Bale's Mile End Institute at Queen Mary University of London,externalsuggested at least 44% of members were over 65 and 71% were male. But, the report stressed, ""none of the parties has got much to write home about when it comes to young people"" and ""Labour members aren't, on average, that much younger than grassroots Tories"". A more worrying issue for the party, it suggested, was that Conservative members appear to be the most disillusioned about how they are treated by their leadership. Just 28% of Conservatives believe they have a significant say on policy compared to three quarters of Lib Dems and SNP members and 61% of Labour members, the survey found. Conservative members ""did less on almost every count than their counterparts in other parties"" to help their party during last year's general election and the difference was ""particularly marked"" for use of social media, the report said, which may help to explain Labour's ""surprisingly impressive performance"". Political parties are under no obligation to publish membership figures - and the Conservatives are not the only party to refuse to do so when the numbers are thought to be falling. UKIP last published a membership figure in July 2016, when it stood at 39,000. According to grassroots website Conservative Home,external, the Conservative Party's membership may have fallen by a quarter from whatever it was in 2016, caused in part by Tories who voted for Remain in the EU referendum not renewing their subscription. But, the site adds, calculating a membership figure is difficult because the data is held by local party branches and there is not a central register.

"This video can not be played Judges ruled Facebook messages supported Danny Kay's claim the sex was consensual A man who had a rape conviction overturned after spending two years in prison has said he feels ""devastated"" and ""let down"" by the justice system. Deleted Facebook messages were found by Danny Kay's sister-in-law leading to the Court of Appealquashing the conviction. He said he fears people will always have ""doubts"" about his innocence. Derbyshire Police said its investigation will be independently reviewed so ""lessons are learned"". Updates on this story and more from the East Midlands Mr Kay, 26, had denied rape at Derby Crown Court in 2013 but was jailed for four-and-a-half years. Judges ruled last month the new evidence supported Mr Kay's claim the sex was consensual. Mr Kay was jailed in 2013 for four and half years after a trial at Derby Crown Court ""It was devastating for a system that you trust to let you down like that"", he told BBC Breakfast. ""I had complete faith in it, I trusted that the truth would come out in the trial and it didn't."" Mr Kay passed on his Facebook log-in details to his sister-in-law who found the archived messages. The woman, who cannot be identified, had said there had been little contact after sex. However, defence lawyers argued at the Court of Appeal the messages showed jurors were given an ""edited and misleading"" picture of their conversation. Mr Kay's lawyer, Philip Rule, claimed material held by police was often handed to defence teams ""very late"". ""Danny's case is slightly unusual because all reasonable lines of inquiry don't necessarily seem to have been followed,"" he said. Mr Kay said he can now start rebuilding his life but ""it's always going to be on my name"". ""There's always going to be people out there that have the doubt."" Derbyshire Police said it has referred its investigation to an independent regional review team to ""ensure lessons are learned"" and ""would welcome the opportunity to discuss the situation with Mr Kay.""

Mr Trump's lawyers had tried to block publication of Fire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House by Michael Wolff, which has now gone on sale early. Mr Wolff's book makes many claims, including that: The Trump team was shocked and horrified by his election win His wife, Melania, was in tears of sadness on election night Mr Trump was angry that A-list stars had snubbed his inauguration The new president ""found the White House to be vexing and even a little scary"" His daughter, Ivanka, had a plan with her husband, Jared Kushner, that she would be ""the first woman president"" Ivanka Trump mocked her dad's ""comb-over"" hairstyle and ""often described the mechanics behind it to friends"" The book is reportedly based on more than 200 interviews but some of the book's excerpts have already been criticised and questioned. Still, even if only half of what the book contains is true, it paints a damning portrait of a paranoid president and a chaotic White House, BBC North America editor Jon Sopel says. This video can not be played Trump harsher on Bannon than he is on his ""worst enemies"" Mr Bannon also reportedly said, referring to a Trump Tower meeting between top campaign officials and Russia:  ""They're going to crack Don Junior like an egg on national TV."" The meeting, which involved Mr Trump's eldest child Donald Trump Jr, is being investigated by Special Counsel Robert Mueller as part of his inquiry into possible collusion between Trump campaign officials and Russia to win the election. Trump-Bannon: A knife fight with consequences 11 explosive claims from new Trump book Who is author of Trump book? Mr Trump strongly denies any collusion took place. Mr Trump said he had not given Mr Wolff access to the White House nor spoken to him for the book, which he said was ""full of lies, misrepresentations and sources that don't exist"".

This video can not be played President Trump faces questions about his relationship with former top aide Steve Bannon Mr Bannon has also been criticised by another former associate, Republican party donor Rebekah Mercer - who has also invested in Breitbart, where Mr Bannon is chairman. In other reaction: A spokesperson for Melania Trump said she had encouraged her husband's presidential bid and was happy he won White House press secretary Sarah Sanders dismissed the book as a ""trashy tabloid fiction"" that she said was ""filled with false and misleading accounts"" On Thursday, the White House said it was banning personal devices, including mobile phones, from the West Wing, citing security concerns. The legal notice has been published by the Washington Post,external. It demands that Mr Wolff and the book's publisher ""immediately cease and desist from any further publication, release or dissemination of the book"". It accused Wolff of making ""numerous false and/or baseless statements"" about Mr Trump and said lawyers were considering pursuing libel charges. Attorney Charles J Harder also sent a cease-and-desist letter to Mr Bannonon Wednesday, saying he had violated a non-disclosure agreement. The book was due out on Tuesday but publication was advanced following the legal moves. Analysis by Anthony Zurcher, BBC News North America reporter Donald Trump might want to familiarise himself with the so-called Streisand Effect. The lesson, most prominently learned by singer Barbra Streisand when she tried to quash photographs of her home that appeared on an obscure website, is that the more you fight against undesirable news, the more you call attention to it. Thanks to his lawyer's ""cease and desist"" letter, Mr Trump is giving Michael Wolff and his explosive book the kind of massive publicity boost money alone can't buy. The highly critical allegations are leading every news programme and newspaper front page (and burying the latest round of glowing US economic news that might otherwise garner attention). Threatening lawsuits is a common tactic for Mr Trump, dating back to his days as a New York real estate mogul. Very seldom does he follow up with actual court action. In this case, such a move would be particularly risky. To meet the ""actual malice"" requirement of US libel law, the president would open himself up to investigation from opposing lawyers seeking to prove that Mr Wolff's allegations had substance - or, at the very least - that he had reason to believe they did.

"Grant Shapps was Tory chairman between 2012 and 2015 The Conservative Party should ""come clean"" about how many members it has, its former chairman has said. Grant Shapps said ""transparency"" on membership numbers was vital even if the figure appeared to be ""embarrassing"". The party last published figures in 2013, when it had 149,800 members but has refused to publish an update since then. Activists and academics have estimated it has fallen to 100,000, or less. That would make the Conservatives the fourth largest party in the UK, behind Labour, the SNP and the Liberal Democrats, according to politics professor and party membership expert Tim Bale, assuming their rivals have ""held above 100,000"". Labour's membership has surged to more than 500,000 under Jeremy Corbyn and the SNP and Lib Dems have also seen increases in recent years, although the SNP, with an estimated 118,000 members, have slipped back slightly from their post-independence referendum peak. The Conservative Party said it did not comment on membership figures. Mr Shapps said David Cameron had ""taken some convincing"" to release the figures at the end of 2013. The then Tory leader believed it would be a ""difficult and embarrassing figure to publish"", said Mr Shapps, who was party chairman at the time. But the Tory MP said he had argued, in a written submission to Mr Cameron, that it would be ""embarrassing not to publish the figures and it will help us increase the membership - and it did"". Mr Shapps said ""coming clean about membership is step number one"" in rebuilding the Conservative Party's campaigning strength ahead of the next general election. He said prospective members had to be given a reason to join the party - and he called for them to be given a say in policy formation, as they were in the Lib Dems and Labour. He also argued for the post of party chairman, currently held by Sir Patrick McLoughlin, to be made an elected position. Tories 'urgently need more volunteers' The Tories seeking young voters John Strafford, of the Campaign for Conservative Democracy, said he had heard from local party sources that the membership could be as low as 70,000, although a Tory source has told the BBC it is ""substantially higher"" than that, without saying what it was. Mr Strafford said a full picture would not emerge until March when people had renewed their subscriptions. He said more than half of local associations had fewer than 100 members - and he warned that if nothing was done to make members feel more involved ""Labour will wipe the floor with us at the next general election"". Apost-mortem on the party's 2017 general election campaign,external, by former cabinet minister, Sir Eric Pickles, called for urgent action to increase membership and the party has said it is ""in the process of taking forward his recommendations"". Labour- About 552,000 as of June 2017 Conservatives- About 149,800 as of December 2013 Scottish National Party- About 118,000 as of August 2017 Liberal Democrats- About 103,000 as of September 2017 Green Party of England and Wales- 55,500 as of March 2017 UK Independence Party- 39,000 as of July 2016 Plaid Cymru- About 8,300 as of 2017 Source:House of Commons Library briefing from September 2017,external Some Tory activists have expressed concern about the party's membership profile, aftera report by Tim Bale's Mile End Institute at Queen Mary University of London,externalsuggested at least 44% of members were over 65 and 71% were male. But, the report stressed, ""none of the parties has got much to write home about when it comes to young people"" and ""Labour members aren't, on average, that much younger than grassroots Tories"". A more worrying issue for the party, it suggested, was that Conservative members appear to be the most disillusioned about how they are treated by their leadership. Just 28% of Conservatives believe they have a significant say on policy compared to three quarters of Lib Dems and SNP members and 61% of Labour members, the survey found. Conservative members ""did less on almost every count than their counterparts in other parties"" to help their party during last year's general election and the difference was ""particularly marked"" for use of social media, the report said, which may help to explain Labour's ""surprisingly impressive performance"". Political parties are under no obligation to publish membership figures - and the Conservatives are not the only party to refuse to do so when the numbers are thought to be falling. UKIP last published a membership figure in July 2016, when it stood at 39,000. According to grassroots website Conservative Home,external, the Conservative Party's membership may have fallen by a quarter from whatever it was in 2016, caused in part by Tories who voted for Remain in the EU referendum not renewing their subscription. But, the site adds, calculating a membership figure is difficult because the data is held by local party branches and there is not a central register.

"This video can not be played Judges ruled Facebook messages supported Danny Kay's claim the sex was consensual A man who had a rape conviction overturned after spending two years in prison has said he feels ""devastated"" and ""let down"" by the justice system. Deleted Facebook messages were found by Danny Kay's sister-in-law leading to the Court of Appealquashing the conviction. He said he fears people will always have ""doubts"" about his innocence. Derbyshire Police said its investigation will be independently reviewed so ""lessons are learned"". Updates on this story and more from the East Midlands Mr Kay, 26, had denied rape at Derby Crown Court in 2013 but was jailed for four-and-a-half years. Judges ruled last month the new evidence supported Mr Kay's claim the sex was consensual. Mr Kay was jailed in 2013 for four and half years after a trial at Derby Crown Court ""It was devastating for a system that you trust to let you down like that"", he told BBC Breakfast. ""I had complete faith in it, I trusted that the truth would come out in the trial and it didn't."" Mr Kay passed on his Facebook log-in details to his sister-in-law who found the archived messages. The woman, who cannot be identified, had said there had been little contact after sex. However, defence lawyers argued at the Court of Appeal the messages showed jurors were given an ""edited and misleading"" picture of their conversation. Mr Kay's lawyer, Philip Rule, claimed material held by police was often handed to defence teams ""very late"". ""Danny's case is slightly unusual because all reasonable lines of inquiry don't necessarily seem to have been followed,"" he said. Mr Kay said he can now start rebuilding his life but ""it's always going to be on my name"". ""There's always going to be people out there that have the doubt."" Derbyshire Police said it has referred its investigation to an independent regional review team to ""ensure lessons are learned"" and ""would welcome the opportunity to discuss the situation with Mr Kay.""

"John Worboys was jailed in 2009 for a string of sex attacks on women in his taxi John Worboys, thought to be one of the UK's most prolific rapists, is to be freed from jail. The black-cab driver is believed to have carried out more than 100 rapes and sexual assaults on women in London between 2002 and 2008. Worboys, now aged 60, gave his victims drug-laced champagne before attacking them in the back of his cab. In 2009, he was convicted at Croydon Crown Court of 19 offences andordered to serve at least eight years in jail,external. This video can not be played Solicitor: My client is ""absolutely horrified"" at the news that Worboys will be released The following year police said other women had come forward and that the suspected number of his victims now totalled more than 100. Worboys, a former stripper from Rotherhithe, south-east London, has spent 10 years in custody including a period on remand. After a hearing about his case in November, the Parole Board decided to approve his release with ""stringent"" licence conditions. He will have to report to probation staff every week and is barred from contacting any of his victims. The black cab used by Worboys in his attacks Fay Maxted, the CEO ofThe Survivors Trust,external, said Worboys' release was ""very frightening and worrying for his victims"". She said: ""He's served his sentence and will be on a stringent licence. But for his victims there will be no parole, there is no let-off for what he has done to them. ""When you are raped, or sexually assaulted in this way, there is no way to recover, especially when these attacks were so deliberate and calculated."" Allow Twitter content?

One of Worboys' victims told BBC News she was unaware that his parole hearing had been successful and he was due to be let out. Harriet Wistrich, a lawyer who represents two of Worboys' victims, said neither woman had received a letter to inform them that the convicted rapist would be released. Black cab rapist: ""I screamed at him to get off me"" Sex attack victims sue cabbie John Worboys and his insurers Worboys police were 'overworked',external She said one of the women felt she should not have had to ""receive the news and see his face everywhere while cooking tea for her children"". Mrs Wistrich criticised the original sentence as being too short, saying it was just ""one month per sexual assault"". She said: ""It feels like another smack in the face, after havingspent years battling for justiceto [hold] the police to account for failing to investigate, that they've also not had the courtesy to inform her"". Worboys' black cab being taken away from outside Croydon Crown Court In 2014 Mrs Wistrich's clients won their High Court bid to receive compensation from the Met Police over the way the case was handled. At the time Mr Justice Green  said ""systemic"" failures in the investigation meant Worboys was not stopped earlier. Worboys' period on licence lasts for at least 10 years and he can be sent back to jail if he breaches the conditions. The Parole Board said in a statement: ""We can confirm that a three-member panel of the Parole Board has directed the release of Mr John Worboys, following an oral hearing."" According to the judge who sentenced him in 2009, John Worboys had ""developed and perfected a web of deceit"" to ensnare his victims. The question raised by his imminent release is whether Worboys may have deceived the Parole Board into concluding that he no longer posed a threat to women. Parole panel members have specialist skills and experience but manipulative individuals who are desperate for freedom may be able to convince even the most sceptical criminal justice practitioner that they should be given a chance. A second concern is whether Worboys has been let out to help cut the backlog of prisoners who have served longer than the minimum term imposed as part of their indeterminate sentence for public protection (IPP). The Parole Board, together with the Ministry of Justice, has been working hard to reduce the numbers - in 2016-17, 46% of all IPP offenders considered for parole were successful. At his trial, jurors heard Worboys picked up his victims in the capital's West End and gave them champagne laced with sedatives, claiming he had won the lottery or had won money at casinos. He was convicted of one rape, five sexual assaults, one attempted assault and 12 drugging charges. As well as being ordered to serve at least eight years, Worboys was given an indeterminate sentence, meaning he could be kept in prison as for as long as he was deemed to remain a danger to the public. In 2010 Worboys hadan appeal against his conviction thrown out by the Court of Appeal, where Lord Justice Moses labelled his offences as ""appalling"". Malcolm Fowler, a retired solicitor of 48 years, said Worboys ""would be anything but a free man"" on his release from prison. ""The judge said he was going to serve at least eight years, and he has served a little more than that. ""Worboys is not walking a free man from prison. He is going to be on a very conscious monitoring system, and rightly so."" The Metropolitan Police said it would not be commenting on Worboys' release.

"Six months ago Britain's car-buying boom seemed unstoppable. But now, for the first time in six years,sales in the all-important month of September have fallen sharply. September is traditionally a bumper month, as the new ""67"" plate would have encouraged people to buy. The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) has blamed economic uncertainty and a lack of consumer confidence. Worries about diesel engines have contributed to a collapse in sales. But why else might the boom be over? Sales of diesel cars fell by 21.7% in September 2017, compared to the same month last year. That amounts to 170,000 diesel sales last month, compared with 217,000 in September last year. Worries about increasing taxes on heavily-polluting cars are likely to be behind that, or concern for the environment. Meanwhile, sales of alternatively-fuelled vehicles (AFVs) - including electric cars - rose by 41%, up from 16,000 vehicles to over 22,000.  Sales of new cars with petrol and diesel engines are due to be banned in the UK from 2040. Most people buy cars on credit. Figures from the Bank of England show that even though the total amount of outstanding consumer credit is growing - partly because of inflation - the growth rate is falling. In other words, consumers may be worried about falling real incomes. So they are less likely to want to increase their monthly outgoings by buying a new car. The peak growth rate of consumer credit was in November last year. Since then the rate has been falling. According to the Financial Conduct Authority the average pay-out for the mis-selling of Payment Protection Insurance (PPI) is between Â£2,000 and Â£3,000. It is thought that many of the 13 million people who have received such sums may have spent them on buying a new car. But as the chart below shows, the number of PPI complaints being filed is falling. So fewer people may be getting that windfall cash.

"This video can not be played Some fear the cost of the levy will be passed on to the consumer MPs are calling for a 25p ""latte levy"" on disposable coffee cups - and a total ban unless recycling improves. Areport by the Environmental Audit Committee,externalsays the tax should be used to improve the UK's recycling and reprocessing facilities. The MPs say throwaway cups should be prohibited altogether by 2023 if they are not all being recycled. In response, Starbucks said it would try out a 5p cup charge in 20 to 25 central London outlets. ""We will begin the trial in February and initially it will last for three months,"" the firm said, adding that it continued to offer a 25p discount to customers who brought their own reusable cups. The government agrees plastic waste is a problem and will seek evidence on a tax on single-use plastics. The committee's chair, Mary Creagh MP, said: ""The UK throws away 2.5 billion disposable coffee cups every year - that's enough to circle the planet five and a half times. ""Almost none are recycled and half a million a day are littered. Coffee cup producers and distributors have not taken action to rectify this and government has sat on its hands. ""The UK's coffee shop market is expanding rapidly, so we need to kick start a revolution in recycling."" Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall: 'Wanton Waste' Four solutions to the disposable coffee cup problem Cup waste: What are coffee chains doing? The Liberal Democrats said they had been campaigning for a charge on coffee cups since September 2016 and were the only party to include the policy in their 2017 election manifesto. The party's environment spokesman, Tim Farron, said: ""I'm glad our call for a coffee cup charge is gaining traction. ""The evidence is clear that these levies work - the 5p charge on plastic bags has massively reduced usage and helped protect our environment."" The proposed 25p levy is being opposed by the makers of paper cups. Mike Turner, of the Paper Cup Alliance, said paper cups were the most sustainable and safe solution for drinks on the go. ""The paper cups we manufacture in the UK are sustainably sourced, responsibly produced, recyclable and, through a number of facilities, are being recycled. We are committed to increasing recycling rates,"" he said. ""Taxing the morning coffee run will not address the issue of litter, but it will hurt consumers and impact already struggling High Streets."" The MPs point out that while some coffee shops offer discounts for customers who bring their own cup, only 1 to 2% of coffee drinkers respond. Following the success of the plastic bag charge, they have concluded that consumers respond more to sticks than to carrots. The plastic lining in coffee cups makes them costly to recycle, and the MPs say the businesses supplying and producing them do not bear the full costs of their disposal. Disposable coffee cups are technically recyclable, but most are not because the UK has just three facilities that can split the paper and plastic components for recycling. The committee has called on the government to require coffee cups from cafes without in-store recycling systems to carry ""not widely recycled"" labels to increase consumer awareness. Cafes with in-store recycling systems should print their cups with ""recyclable in store only"", the MPs add. Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall backs the 'latte levy' The committee's recommendations were welcomed by environmental campaigners. Fiona Nicholls from Greenpeace UK, said the problem was getting bigger: ""We must not allow the packaging industry to water down these recommendations any further."" Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall, chef and campaigner, said: ""The UK has woken up and smelled the coffee cup nightmare. ""The committee has recognised that the huge mountain of disposable coffee cups is effectively unrecyclable, and is overwhelming and disrupting the nation's waste disposal systems, ultimately polluting our rivers and seas, and needs urgent action."" The British Coffee Association's Chris Stemman also welcomed the report's broad principles, but said a levy was not the answer. ""It places an unfair and additional cost on coffee drinking consumers only - despite paper cups only contributing 0.7% of total paper packaging waste,"" he told BBC News. ""We urge the government to ensure that if any potential tax is considered, that it is ring-fenced and used specifically to invest in new 'binfrastructure' and to improve recycling processes with local authorities that make it easier to separate and stream paper cups and other waste products."" Mr Stemman said the industry should continue to focus on other environmental issues such as cutting water use, carbon reduction, and turning waste coffee grounds into biofuel. The government plans to produce a new plastics policy later in the year.

"A South Korean soldier uses a mobile phone beside an advert for the Games in Seoul North Korea has accepted an offer to attend high-level talks next week, South Korean officials have said. The meeting, on 9 January, will focus on finding a way for North Korean athletes to attend the Winter Olympic Games in South Korea in February. North Korean leader Kim Jong-un said this week that sending a delegation to the Games would be ""a good opportunity to show unity of the people"". The meeting is expected to be held at Panmunjom, on the border. These will be the first high-level talks both Koreas have had since December 2015. It is not yet clear who will be attending. South Korea's President Moon Jae-in has previously said he sees the Winter Olympics as a ""groundbreaking chance"" to improve relations between the Koreas, two countries still technically at war. Korea talks: Finally, a bit of optimism What we know of Koreas' red and green phones However some have expressed doubts over the significance of the move. US Defense Secretary James Mattis said on Thursday that the agreement was ""the result of international pressure"", but added that it was unclear whether the move was ""a real olive branch"" or a ""one-off from [Mr Kim]."" Japan's defence minister said his country would remain vigilant, adding that the North went through ""phases of apparent dialogue and provocation"" and would continue its weapons programme. Panmunjom has been designated as a place where officials from both sides can meet The so-called peace village, in the heavily guarded demilitarised zone (DMZ), is where the two sides have historically held talks. According to an official from South Korea's presidential office, the meeting's priority will be the Pyeongchang Winter Games. However, he told South Korea's Yonhap news agency that he believed there would also ""be discussions related to improving South-North ties after the North's participation in the Olympics becomes final"". Will N Korea compete in Winter Olympics? A history of North Korea at the Olympics Earlier this week, in a small sign of progress, North Korea restored a telephone hotline at their mutual border, to enable the first contact about talks to be made. North and South Korea had a brief initial call However, the South Korean Unification Ministry official told AFP that the acceptance of the invitation to talks was sent by fax on Friday morning. ""The two sides decided to discuss working-level issues for the talks by exchanging documents,"" Baik Tae-hyun, a spokesman of Seoul's unification ministry, told Yonhap. The tentative moves towards the Olympic appearance come after months of escalating rhetoric from North Korea and the US. The leaders of both countries have each threatened the other with nuclear annihilation. North Korea has also infuriated the world with its repeated nuclear tests and missile launches, which have resulted in tightened international sanctions. As part of efforts to smooth the path to the Olympics, the US has agreed to a request from South Korea to suspend joint military operations, scheduled to take place during the Games. North Korea despises the drills, which it sees as invasion preparations. Mr Mattis said the delay was ""a practical matter"" - part of ""the normal give and take"", and the drills would be conducted after the Paralympics finished on 19 March. Japan added on Friday that the decision to delay drills was ""not designed to compromise the increased pressure on North Korea"". Japan's prime minister says his country is facing its greatest threat since World War Two Japan's Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga said that Tokyo, Washington and Seoul remained were still determined to ""increase pressure"" on North Korea. Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe on Thursday highlighted the increasing threat posed by North Korea. ""It is not an exaggeration to say the security environment surrounding Japan is at its severest since the Second World War"", he said. ""By raising pressure on North Korea together with the international community, I intend to do my utmost to solve [its] nuclear, missiles and abduction issues.""

""The paper cups we manufacture in the UK are sustainably sourced, responsibly produced, recyclable and, through a number of facilities, are being recycled.

The plastic lining in coffee cups makes them costly to recycle, and the MPs say the businesses supplying and producing them do not bear the full costs of their disposal. Disposable coffee cups are technically recyclable, but most are not because the UK has just three facilities that can split the paper and plastic components for recycling.

" These are just some of the characters involved in a complex smuggling racket that is almost impossible to police because it crosses so many borders and involves countless criminals. Between 2007-14, rhino poaching rose 9000%. The very existence of the species is threatened by organised crime. Source: South Africa Department for Environmental Affairs Warning: This piece contains images that may be upsetting to some people. Rhino poaching networks are typical of the structure of the new mafias in the global marketplace. The term mafia used to conjure up images of Marlon Brando as Don Corleone in The Godfather, or Tony Soprano as the head of the mob in New Jersey. But in the early 1990s, mafias started to adapt to the new era of globalisation. And just as multinational corporations are often opaque, spreading their operations across many territories and tax havens with complex supply lines, so too are the new mafias. I started researching the rise of this new form of transnational organised crime 14 years ago. During my travels around the globe talking to criminals and law enforcement officials, I realised how new mafias often operate like franchises. James Norton stars inMcMafia, the drama based on Misha Glenny's 2008 non-fiction book exploring global crime networks. The series is on Sunday at 21:00 GMT on BBC One. Mark Galeotti, an expert on transnational crime and security in Russia, explained how it worked. One of the most powerful organised crime groups in Moscow was the Chechen mafia, many of whose members hailed from the lawless Russian republic of Chechnya. “The Chechen mafia became a brand name, a franchise - McMafia if you like,” he explained. “They would sell the moniker ‘Chechen’ to protection rackets in other towns provided they paid, of course, and provided they always carried out their word. If a group claimed a Chechen connection, but didn’t carry out its threats to the letter, it was devaluing the brand. The original Chechens would come after them.” This model started in Russia in the 1990s but it has now spread around the world across a range of criminal enterprises - everything from the Colombian drug cartels to Vietnamese groups trading in endangered wildlife species. And then you have the emergence of the “mafia state” - a country run by and for a powerful clique or network of corrupt politicians and state intelligence officials with close links to organised criminal networks. Russia under Vladimir Putin has often been accused of this. So has North Korea. In the case of Kim Jong-un’s regime, it’s because North Korea can’t or won’t integrate into the global financial system. As long as sanctions continue against Pyongyang, the only way it can obtain hard currency is through nefarious means. North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un In 2015, police in the Mozambican capital, Maputo, arrested a group of men and confiscated rhino horn, a large sum of dollars, a small amount of local currency, and, rather strangely, four sacks of rice. Two of the arrested men were North Koreans who claimed to be diplomats based in South Africa. Their bail was set at $30,000, which they deposited before promptly fleeing the country. A number of North Korea’s African embassies form a nexus of illicit trade in rhino horn, cigarettes and minerals” The investigative reporter Julian Rademeyer spotted a news report about the arrests and started delving deeper, eventually publishing the landmark studyDiplomats and Deceit. When I visited Rademeyer in Johannesburg, I was shocked to hear about the extent of North Korea’s involvement in the trade as he had detailed in his report. “A number of North Korea’s African embassies form a nexus of illicit trade in rhino horn, cigarettes and minerals,” he wrote. Rademeyer explains further “that the diplomats are working under the auspices of Bureau 38, a shadowy government department whose sole purpose is to accrue hard currency”. He also predicted that: “Increasingly stringent economic sanctions designed to cripple North Korea’s nuclear weapons capabilities will likely fuel the expansion of the regime’s illicit activities and state-sponsored criminal networks.” The average ambassadorial salary in the North Korean foreign service is about $1,000 (£740) a month, which in most capitals is not enough to live on. So, in addition to finding hard currency for their bosses in Pyongyang, they have a huge incentive to add to their own salaries. Over time, North Korean diplomats have been busted for selling untaxed alcohol and cigarettes, for dealing heroin and methamphetamines, and for trafficking women for sexual purposes. South Korea estimates that trade in illicit goods and services provides North Korea with revenues of almost $1bn a year. In 2006, defectors from North Korea made the unexpected claim that the late dictator, Kim Jong-il, had decided to end his country’s engagement in the narcotics trade. Apparently, he felt the trade was damaging his country’s reputation unduly. That’s one theory. The other is that the government in Beijing was concerned about the rising rates of drug addiction in China and applied pressure accordingly. An end to drug trafficking meant that the diplomats could no longer meet their financial obligations by, say, smuggling 3,000 tabs of amphetamines in a diplomatic bag. That was when North Koreans based in Africa spotted a market opportunity. The rising wealth of the Chinese and Vietnamese middle classes was reviving demand for rhino horn. Back in the early 2000s, rhino horn didn’t feature on the list of illicit goods and services favoured by the new transnational crime gangs. They were more likely to be selling women, drugs and arms. Rhino horn shavings In the two decades before 2008, authorities in southern Africa as well as in China and Yemen, the two most important markets, appeared to have successfully eradicated most of the trade in rhino horn as well as in ivory. But rhino hornhas continued to be in demand. Powdered horn has been used in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) for more than four millennia. Carved into hilts for traditional daggers known as jambiyas, rhino horn was also in high demand in Yemen during the 1970s and 1980s. Small pockets of demand remain but buyers cannot compete with the high prices offered in south-east Asia. Rhino horn is often used in the hilt of traditional Yemeni daggers known as jambiyas Numbers of both rhinos and elephants were growing at a healthy pace and the threat to some species had been downgraded by Cites, the global regulator for endangered wildlife. But in 2008, the number of rhinos slaughtered for their horns suddenly began to shoot up ata dizzying pace. Rhino horn is now more valuable than cocaine, heroin or gold. Depending on where it is sold, the horn can fetch between $25,000 and $60,000 per kilo. The profits in this trade are phenomenal. The nexus of impoverished Africans and corrupt officials working in tandem with East Asian criminals and spies poses a particular problem to traditional law enforcement and requires huge amounts of resources that most African states don’t possess. “Big Joe” Nyalunga is currently awaiting trial with a group of other defendants oncharges of rhino poaching. Big Joe is a former South African police inspector so he is familiar with the legal system. He was arrested as far back as December 2012 but for much of the time since he has been out on bail. He is now scheduled to go on trial in the spring of 2018. He denies all the charges against him. Big Joe is alleged to be what’s known as a “kingpin”. The kingpins organise rhino poaching in rural communities where the locals are desperately poor and know how to track and hunt wildlife. They sell the horn to middlemen who export the product, usually to East Asia. Here they are either made into lucky trinkets or used in traditional medicine in an attempt to cure everything from cancer to impotence. Prosecutors allege that Big Joe has made huge profits from this trade over the years. Ansie Venter has developed a reputation as one of the most tenacious prosecutors of wildlife crimes in South Africa and she’s been trying to get Big Joe into the dock for some years. “I don’t like the publicity I get for this work but I am prepared to put up with it in order to protect the poor rhinos,” she told me. Kruger National Park, South Africa: Investigators examine the carcass of a rhino killed for its horn Venter describes just how nasty these crimes are. These majestic beasts are immobilised with high-powered hunting rifles before having their horns sawn off while still alive and conscious. They are then left to bleed slowly to death. The poachers don’t want to kill them immediately because a dead rhino will attract vultures and that in turn alerts the rangers. But kingpins are often regarded as Robin Hood figures by the people who work for them in South Africa, neighbouring Zimbabwe and Mozambique. The rural poor resent the fact that considerable resources go into protecting wild animals for the benefit of wealthy white tourists while their communities are left to rot. [Poachers] are usually uneducated, poor people at the low end of the food chain who are simply desperate for an income” Kingpins don’t have any problem recruiting from the villages around South Africa’s huge Kruger National Park where most of the big game can be found and where tourists spend thousands of pounds for the privilege of looking at them. Venter tells me about a poacher she had prosecuted called Elliot Mzimba. Sentenced to seven years in prison, the 43-year-old father-of-six came from a part of rural Mozambique which borders the Kruger National Park. Venter says that Mzimba was typical of the kind of defendants who come before her: “They are usually uneducated, poor people at the low end of the food chain who are simply desperate for an income.” The Kruger, which is roughly the size of Wales, has a border with Zimbabwe. The national park is also home to the largest concentration of rhinos anywhere in the world. Once the breadbasket of Africa, Zimbabwe was hit by a double whammy after the turn of the millennium. Firstly, Robert Mugabe’s land reform programme led to the closure of many profitable commercial farms and a dramatic rise in rural unemployment. This was followed in 2008 by the global financial crash and a collapse in commodity prices on which Zimbabwe depended so heavily for foreign currency. The economic chaos persuaded some Zimbabweans to turn to rhino poaching to augment their incomes. But Zimbabwe was home to relatively few of these animals. When the global crash came, Zimbabwean poachers cast their eyes over the border. “In South Africa, the situation was quite lax,” one of the poachers explained, “so we decided to move to that side. Here in Zim the number of rhinos are low not like in South Africa.” And the Zimbabweans weren’t the only foreigners with their eyes on South Africa’s big game. Around the same time, East Asians also started to appear in and around the Kruger. These included not just North Korean diplomats, but even more bizarrely, Thai lap dancing girls and Vietnamese gangsters. Indeed among the people originally arrested along with Big Joe Nyalunga were two Vietnamese citizens. For the very rich it’s still possible to legally kill big game in South Africa - including rhinos, elephants and lions - in “trophy hunts”. The traditional clients tend to be wealthy European or American middle-aged men - trophy-hunting made headlines when Minnesota dentist Walter Palmer killed Cecil the lion in Zimbabwe. Amateur hunter Walter Palmer (l) poses with a lion (not Cecil) But in 2006, the South African organisers of these deadly safaris noticed a new type of clientele - Vietnamese “businessmen” and, even more incongruously, young women from Thailand. Neither the Vietnamese nor the Thais had the skills to shoot big game. Instead, they employed local marksmen to take down the beasts. The young women in skimpy safari outfits would then pose for selfies in front of the slaughtered animals. It later transpired that the Thai women worked as dancers and sex workers in the bars of Johannesburg and were being employed by Vietnamese and Laotians for extra cash on the side. The criminologist Annette Hübschle explained that a Laotian wildlife trafficking network used a company as a front. As a clever cost-saving measure, “the Thai representative... in South Africa recruited Thai sex workers… to accompany him and his South African intermediaries to private hunting reserves and farms to act as stand-ins for trophy hunters. The wildlife traffickers thus saved on financing travel costs from south-east Asia to South Africa,” she explained. One former rhino trader turned whistleblower said: “The women were paid 5,000 rand (£300; $400) each for taking part in the hunt. Many of them have been trafficked to South Africa and were trying to pay off the debts that bound them to their pimps.” This intersection of two criminal trades is a common feature of the modern mafias. Another feature of the new global mafias is that they’re multi-million dollar enterprises which are often better resourced than the law enforcement agencies charged with chasing them. Poachers use military-style weapons, vehicles and helicopters in pursuit of elephants and rhinos, frustrating the efforts of wildlife rangers to stop them. Khristopher Carlson, a senior researcher at the Small Arms Survey, which studies patterns of armed violence, told a UN meeting that systematic tracing of ammunition found at poaching kill sites in Africa, along with seized weapons, could help track and stop the movement of illicit weapons. South Africa’s Kruger National Park and the private game reserves that surround it have militarised their anti-poaching units - equipping them with aircraft, drones and sophisticated weaponry. Then there's the likes of Vetpaw (Veterans Empowered to Protect African Wildlife), an American charity which sends veterans of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan to Africa to train anti-poaching rangers. You can follow them on Twitter. Burly, heavily armed men in baseball caps, sunglasses and army fatigues post pictures of their captives with captions like “Gotcha!”. Some experts now fear an arms race is developing between poachers and gamekeepers. This ramping up of responses to organised crime isn’t restricted to the rhino trade. The US-led War on Drugs has been going down this route for decades, leading to tens of thousands of deaths in countries such as Mexico, Colombia and Brazil. More recently the European Union has sent in naval vessels to combat the people-smuggling rings based in Libya. The gangs make huge profits transporting African migrants across the Mediterranean in flimsy vessels which sink with terrible regularity. All this reflects growing concern around the world that the culture of McMafia is flourishing as never before. Global crime expert Tuesday Reitano has argued that this “may lock military forces into a long-term crime fighting roles for which they are ill-prepared”. And there’s another concern - that organised crime will just corrupt key individuals in the forces fighting them. Reitano works for The Global Initiative Against Transnational Organized Crime, which is dedicated to reducing the influence of criminal gangs around the world. But she remains worried that the militarisation of the movement to protect rhinos could be backfiring. “Weapons are proliferating across East Africa as a direct result of militarised efforts to counter elephant and rhinoceros poaching,” she said. “We need to understand and assess the possible unintended consequences of these strategies before implementing them.” There is a growing consensus among security specialists and law enforcement officials around the world that transnational organised crime is now one of the top global threats facing us - up there with climate change, pandemics and weapons of mass destruction. But as the fate of the rhino suggests, we are long way from solving this problem. Misha Glenny is a former BBC journalist and author of McMafia, the non-fiction work that inspired the current BBC One drama. The series is broadcast on Sundays at 21:00 GMT on BBC One.

"Actress and model Lily Cole has spoken about facing ""prejudice"" in a row over her involvement in events to mark the bicentenary of Emily Bronte's birth. Cole has been named ""creative partner"" for the celebrations by the Bronte Parsonage Museum in West Yorkshire. Bronte expert Nick Holland has quit the Bronte Society, saying the Wuthering Heights author would not have approved of a supermodel getting the role. But Cole said the writer would not have judged any work ""on name alone"". In her role, Cole is making a short film for the museum about Wuthering Heights anti-hero Heathcliff. It will also address gender politics and women's rights in the year that marks 100 years since women got the vote. The Bronte sisters - Emily, Charlotte and Anne - initially published their work under pseudonyms so they would be taken seriously by the 19th Century literary establishment. The Bronte sisters originally used the pseudonyms Currer, Ellis, and Acton Bell Cole said the criticism about her involvement made her wonder whether she should present her film under a pseudonym too, ""so that it will be judged on its own merits, rather than on my name, my gender, my image or my teenage decisions"". She said: ""I would not be so presumptuous as to guess Emily's reaction to my appointment as a creative partner at the museum, were she alive today. ""Yet I respect her intellect and integrity enough to believe that she would not judge any piece of work on name alone."" Cole, 30, made her name as a model in her teens, and has had acting roles in the 2007 St Trinian's film and Channel 5's Elizabeth I. She graduated from Cambridge University with a double first in History of Art and is, she says, ""an advocate for sociopolitical and environmental issues"" through her skill-sharing app Impossible. Emily Bronte bicentenary events unveiled Lily Cole - from model to activist St Trinian's: Where are they now? Nick Holland, who has published books on the literary sisters,wrote on his blog,external: ""The central question should be, what would Emily Bronte think if she found that the role of chief 'artist' and organiser in her celebratory year was a supermodel? ""We all know the answer to that, and anyone who doesn't isn't fit to make the decision or have any role in the governance of the Bronte Society."" The Society, which runs the museum in Haworth, should have appointed a writer instead, he argued. He concluded: ""It's best that I leave the society now, before they announce James Corden as the creative partner for 2019, a year in which Patrick Bronte is being remembered, and Rita Ora as organiser for Anne Bronte's celebrations in 2020."" The Bronte Society said Cole's ""innovative projects in the fields of literacy, nature, story-telling and the environment"" made her a ""perfect fit for Emily"". Public art installation in free speech row Apple: Chip flaw in all Macs and iPhones Mystery powder paralyses backpackers 2018 offers us both the 100th anniversary of women's suffrage in the UK, and the 200th anniversary of Emily Bronte's birth, so it feels poignant to begin the year on the topic of prejudice. Emily Bronte, whose extraordinary novel Wuthering Heights has stirred the world for over 150 years, published her work under an androgynous pseudonym: Ellis Bell. Writing in 1850, Charlotte Bronte explained why she and her sisters Emily and Anne all used pseudonyms: ""We did not like to declare ourselves women, because we had a vague impression that authoresses are liable to be looked on with prejudice."" When I was asked by the Bronte Parsonage Museum to work on a piece to commemorate Emily Bronte's birth, I immediately thought of Emily's pseudonym, and what that gesture represented. Why could a woman not publish under her own name? What was life like for women living in the UK in the 19th Century? What circumstances would also give rise to a child being found abandoned in a city in the 18th Century, as Heathcliff was? Now I find myself wondering, fleetingly, if I should present the short film I am working on for the Bronte Parsonage Museum under a pseudonym myself, so that it will be judged on its own merits, rather than on my name, my gender, my image or my teenage decisions. I would not be so presumptuous as to guess Emily's reaction to my appointment as a creative partner at the museum, were she alive today. Yet I respect her intellect and integrity enough to believe that she would not judge any piece of work on name alone. In the meantime I am excited to see how much Emily still means to so many people, and I welcome 2018 to celebrate her.

"A South Korean soldier uses a mobile phone beside an advert for the Games in Seoul North Korea has accepted an offer to attend high-level talks next week, South Korean officials have said. The meeting, on 9 January, will focus on finding a way for North Korean athletes to attend the Winter Olympic Games in South Korea in February. North Korean leader Kim Jong-un said this week that sending a delegation to the Games would be ""a good opportunity to show unity of the people"". The meeting is expected to be held at Panmunjom, on the border. These will be the first high-level talks both Koreas have had since December 2015. It is not yet clear who will be attending. South Korea's President Moon Jae-in has previously said he sees the Winter Olympics as a ""groundbreaking chance"" to improve relations between the Koreas, two countries still technically at war. Korea talks: Finally, a bit of optimism What we know of Koreas' red and green phones However some have expressed doubts over the significance of the move. US Defense Secretary James Mattis said on Thursday that the agreement was ""the result of international pressure"", but added that it was unclear whether the move was ""a real olive branch"" or a ""one-off from [Mr Kim]."" Japan's defence minister said his country would remain vigilant, adding that the North went through ""phases of apparent dialogue and provocation"" and would continue its weapons programme. Panmunjom has been designated as a place where officials from both sides can meet The so-called peace village, in the heavily guarded demilitarised zone (DMZ), is where the two sides have historically held talks. According to an official from South Korea's presidential office, the meeting's priority will be the Pyeongchang Winter Games. However, he told South Korea's Yonhap news agency that he believed there would also ""be discussions related to improving South-North ties after the North's participation in the Olympics becomes final"". Will N Korea compete in Winter Olympics? A history of North Korea at the Olympics Earlier this week, in a small sign of progress, North Korea restored a telephone hotline at their mutual border, to enable the first contact about talks to be made. North and South Korea had a brief initial call However, the South Korean Unification Ministry official told AFP that the acceptance of the invitation to talks was sent by fax on Friday morning. ""The two sides decided to discuss working-level issues for the talks by exchanging documents,"" Baik Tae-hyun, a spokesman of Seoul's unification ministry, told Yonhap. The tentative moves towards the Olympic appearance come after months of escalating rhetoric from North Korea and the US. The leaders of both countries have each threatened the other with nuclear annihilation. North Korea has also infuriated the world with its repeated nuclear tests and missile launches, which have resulted in tightened international sanctions. As part of efforts to smooth the path to the Olympics, the US has agreed to a request from South Korea to suspend joint military operations, scheduled to take place during the Games. North Korea despises the drills, which it sees as invasion preparations. Mr Mattis said the delay was ""a practical matter"" - part of ""the normal give and take"", and the drills would be conducted after the Paralympics finished on 19 March. Japan added on Friday that the decision to delay drills was ""not designed to compromise the increased pressure on North Korea"". Japan's prime minister says his country is facing its greatest threat since World War Two Japan's Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga said that Tokyo, Washington and Seoul remained were still determined to ""increase pressure"" on North Korea. Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe on Thursday highlighted the increasing threat posed by North Korea. ""It is not an exaggeration to say the security environment surrounding Japan is at its severest since the Second World War"", he said. ""By raising pressure on North Korea together with the international community, I intend to do my utmost to solve [its] nuclear, missiles and abduction issues.""

Emily Bronte, whose extraordinary novel Wuthering Heights has stirred the world for over 150 years, published her work under an androgynous pseudonym: Ellis Bell. Writing in 1850, Charlotte Bronte explained why she and her sisters Emily and Anne all used pseudonyms: ""We did not like to declare ourselves women, because we had a vague impression that authoresses are liable to be looked on with prejudice."" When I was asked by the Bronte Parsonage Museum to work on a piece to commemorate Emily Bronte's birth, I immediately thought of Emily's pseudonym, and what that gesture represented. Why could a woman not publish under her own name? What was life like for women living in the UK in the 19th Century? What circumstances would also give rise to a child being found abandoned in a city in the 18th Century, as Heathcliff was? Now I find myself wondering, fleetingly, if I should present the short film I am working on for the Bronte Parsonage Museum under a pseudonym myself, so that it will be judged on its own merits, rather than on my name, my gender, my image or my teenage decisions. I would not be so presumptuous as to guess Emily's reaction to my appointment as a creative partner at the museum, were she alive today. Yet I respect her intellect and integrity enough to believe that she would not judge any piece of work on name alone. In the meantime I am excited to see how much Emily still means to so many people, and I welcome 2018 to celebrate her.

"This video can not be played An Irn Bru fan explains why he is protesting against the drinks new recipe. Fans of Irn Bru have started stockpiling the soft drink ahead of a planned change in recipe. Makers of the fizzy favourite are changing the formula of the product to cut the sugar content by almost half. It is part of a sugar-reduction programme by AG Barr before the government levy on sugary drinks comes into effect in 2018. But fans have launched the ""Hands off our Irn Bru"" petition, attracting more than 6,000 signatures. Irn Bru drinkers are angry after the manufacturer revealed the new flavour would appear in stores in January. They have been taking to social media to vent their dismay, with stories of people buying up to 250 cans mentioned but not substantiated. The petition has attracted more than 6,000 signatures The Cumbernauld-based firm announced last year that it would cut Irn Bru's sugar content from about 10g per 100ml to just below 5g. This will reduce the calorie count per can from just under 140 to about 66. AG Barr said the move was part of a ""long-standing sugar reduction programme"". Heading the ""Hands off our Irn Bru"" petition is joiner Ryan Allan from Ayr. He has already made preparations to preserve his favourite drink and has a stockpile for  ""when he is hungover"". He told the BBC's Kaye Adams programme: ""I've got 24 glass bottles in my loft that will do me for emergencies."" His anger was mostly at what will be replacing the sugar: ""I know its not going to be the same product and I don't want to get used to it. ""I know sugar has its concerns but so do sweeteners and people are not as aware of that as they should be. ""I know the stuff is about to hit the shelves now and I'm going to ask people to try it out of curiosity but if you don't like it don't buy it, vote with your pound."" Chief executive Roger White said the company had ""significantly"" reduced sugar across its portfolio in recent years On his change.org petition, he stated: ""The government's 'sugar tax' that would apply to the sales of sugary drinks is similar to the way cigarettes and alcohol are taxed. ""I would far rather pay more for a bottle than have an altered recipe version."" And he added: ""I believe that a responsible adult should have the choice as to what poisons they want to put in their body."" 'Spiked vegan' chef offers resignation Jet Airways grounds pilots after 'cockpit fight' Major flaw in millions of Intel chips revealed A spokesperson from A.G. Barr said: ""From January 2018 Irn Bru will continue to be made using the same secret Irn Bru flavour essence, but with less sugar. ""The vast majority of our drinkers want less sugar in their Irn Bru so that's what we're now offering. ""We know that our loyal drinkers love Irn Bru for its unique great taste and we've worked hard to deliver this. ""We ran lots of taste tests that showed most people can't tell the difference - 9 out of 10 regular Irn Bru drinkers told us we had a good or excellent taste match.

"This video can not be played Dozens queued for the midnight release of Fire and Fury Donald Trump says a newly released book containing damaging allegations about his administration is ""full of lies"". The book cites former top aide Steve Bannon as describing a meeting with a group of Russians at which Mr Trump's son was present as ""treasonous"". It also portrays Mr Trump as being surprised by winning the presidency. Mr Trump's lawyers had tried to block publication of Fire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House by Michael Wolff, which has now gone on sale early. Mr Wolff's book makes many claims, including that: The Trump team was shocked and horrified by his election win His wife, Melania, was in tears of sadness on election night Mr Trump was angry that A-list stars had snubbed his inauguration The new president ""found the White House to be vexing and even a little scary"" His daughter, Ivanka, had a plan with her husband, Jared Kushner, that she would be ""the first woman president"" Ivanka Trump mocked her dad's ""comb-over"" hairstyle and ""often described the mechanics behind it to friends"" The book is reportedly based on more than 200 interviews but some of the book's excerpts have already been criticised and questioned. Still, even if only half of what the book contains is true, it paints a damning portrait of a paranoid president and a chaotic White House, BBC North America editor Jon Sopel says. This video can not be played Trump harsher on Bannon than he is on his ""worst enemies"" Mr Bannon also reportedly said, referring to a Trump Tower meeting between top campaign officials and Russia:  ""They're going to crack Don Junior like an egg on national TV."" The meeting, which involved Mr Trump's eldest child Donald Trump Jr, is being investigated by Special Counsel Robert Mueller as part of his inquiry into possible collusion between Trump campaign officials and Russia to win the election. Trump-Bannon: A knife fight with consequences 11 explosive claims from new Trump book Who is author of Trump book? Mr Trump strongly denies any collusion took place. Mr Trump said he had not given Mr Wolff access to the White House nor spoken to him for the book, which he said was ""full of lies, misrepresentations and sources that don't exist"".

After the president met Republican senators on Thursday, a reporter asked Mr Trump if his former strategist had betrayed him.

This video can not be played President Trump faces questions about his relationship with former top aide Steve Bannon Mr Bannon has also been criticised by another former associate, Republican party donor Rebekah Mercer - who has also invested in Breitbart, where Mr Bannon is chairman. In other reaction: A spokesperson for Melania Trump said she had encouraged her husband's presidential bid and was happy he won White House press secretary Sarah Sanders dismissed the book as a ""trashy tabloid fiction"" that she said was ""filled with false and misleading accounts"" On Thursday, the White House said it was banning personal devices, including mobile phones, from the West Wing, citing security concerns. The legal notice has been published by the Washington Post,external. It demands that Mr Wolff and the book's publisher ""immediately cease and desist from any further publication, release or dissemination of the book"". It accused Wolff of making ""numerous false and/or baseless statements"" about Mr Trump and said lawyers were considering pursuing libel charges. Attorney Charles J Harder also sent a cease-and-desist letter to Mr Bannonon Wednesday, saying he had violated a non-disclosure agreement. The book was due out on Tuesday but publication was advanced following the legal moves. Analysis by Anthony Zurcher, BBC News North America reporter Donald Trump might want to familiarise himself with the so-called Streisand Effect. The lesson, most prominently learned by singer Barbra Streisand when she tried to quash photographs of her home that appeared on an obscure website, is that the more you fight against undesirable news, the more you call attention to it. Thanks to his lawyer's ""cease and desist"" letter, Mr Trump is giving Michael Wolff and his explosive book the kind of massive publicity boost money alone can't buy. The highly critical allegations are leading every news programme and newspaper front page (and burying the latest round of glowing US economic news that might otherwise garner attention). Threatening lawsuits is a common tactic for Mr Trump, dating back to his days as a New York real estate mogul. Very seldom does he follow up with actual court action. In this case, such a move would be particularly risky. To meet the ""actual malice"" requirement of US libel law, the president would open himself up to investigation from opposing lawyers seeking to prove that Mr Wolff's allegations had substance - or, at the very least - that he had reason to believe they did.

"John Worboys was jailed in 2009 for a string of sex attacks on women in his taxi The chairman of the Parole Board has apologised ""unreservedly"" that some victims of sex attacker John Worboys were not told about his release. The former black-cab driver served ten years after being convicted of 19 offences, including one rape, although police believe he attacked many more. The CPS said 83 complaints were made during the initial investigation, but many did not pass the evidential test. A number of victims' groups have condemned his release. Parole Board chairman Nick Hardwick said hearing the decision must have been ""horrible"" for the women, but the board was ""confident"" 60-year-old Worboys would not reoffend. He said the fact some victims were not informed was a fault with the parole system, but the decision itself would have been carefully considered. Prof Hardwick is to be summoned before the House of Commons Justice Committee to explain how the decision was reached and why some victims had not been informed. ""We look at a whole range of evidence - both what happened in the original offences, the judge's sentencing remarks, the programmes or work a prisoner has done, reports from people who know the prisoner well,"" he said. ""So we look at a whole range of evidence in coming to our decision. And we have to be confident that someone won't reoffend before we release them. And that's what the panel would have done in this case."" The CPS said Sir Keir Starmer did not have ""any involvement"" in Worboys' case. He had faced questions over the release as he was director of public prosecutions at the time of Worboys' trial. Why was he released from indefinite term? This video can not be played Parole Board Chair apologises ""unreservedly"" Worboys' victims didn't know of release The committee's chairman Bob Neill said what had happened was ""very disturbing"" and it was ""vital that the public has confidence in Parole Board decisions"". London Mayor Sadiq Khan, who called on the Parole Board to reconsider its decision, said: ""Too often victims are at best treated as an afterthought, or ignored altogether and this seems to have happened again in this case."" The Met Police revealed in 2010 that 19 other victims had come forward in the wake of Worboys's conviction. Officers suspected he had attacked more than 100 women between 2002 and 2008. These allegations were investigated, but no further action was taken on the advice of the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS), police said. In a statement, the Metropolitan Police added that ""all 19 complainants were notified."" In October 2010, the CPS said in a statement: ""We have seen no new material since the trial and we actually considered somewhere between 35 and 40 case files at the time."" BBC home affairs correspondent Danny Shaw said it was ""far from clear that the Met Police ever asked the CPS to make further charging decisions"". Sir Keir Starmer said it was important any fresh complaints were made to the police Speaking outside his home on Friday, Sir Keir Starmer said that if anybody felt allegations they had made had not been sufficiently investigated they should ""go to the police"". When asked whether he thought the right decision was made by prosecutors, the shadow Brexit secretary said only the Crown Prosecution Service could provide ""an accurate readout of the decisions that were made"". Black cab rapist: ""I screamed at him to get off me"" Sex attack victims sue cabbie John Worboys and his insurers Worboys police were 'overworked',external As BBC home affairs correspondent Danny Shaw explains, Parole Board members are kept busy. Last year they dealt with 500 cases each week, most of which were considered ""on the papers"", in other words by reading documents and reports about a prisoner. But in the most serious cases, involving about 7,000 inmates, they held oral hearings. These enable the parole panel to question the prisoner who is seeking release and form a judgment about whether they are prepared for life beyond bars, committed to reform their ways and able to be safely managed in the community. To help them make that assessment, panels usually take evidence from prison and probation staff and psychologists who have examined the offender. A representative of the justice secretary will make a submission and the offender's victims are allowed to read out a statement. Parole members will also have spent time scrutinising dozens of files detailing the prisoner's offending history, the trial judge's sentencing remarks and a record of their progress in jail. This video can not be played Solicitor: My client is ""absolutely horrified"" at the news that Worboys will be released One of Worboys's victims told BBC News she was unaware that his parole hearing had been successful and he was due to be let out. And Harriet Wistrich, a lawyer who represents two of Worboys's victims, said neither woman had received a letter to inform them the convicted rapist would be released. She said one of the women felt she should not have had to ""receive the news and see his face everywhere while cooking tea for her children"". Responsibility for informing victims about Worboys's release rested with the National Probation Service. The Ministry of Justice said some victims had chosen not to be updated about the case while others decided to be informed by letters which would have taken some time to arrive. ""Our priority is to support victims and it is right that we respect their decisions about how they are contacted,"" a spokesperson said. Some victims were sent a letter informing them of the Parole Board's decision The ruling by the Parole Board - which examines the cases of prisoners in England and Wales - has sparked outrage among victims' support groups. The charity Rape Crisis described Worboys's period of incarceration as ""woefully short"" for such a ""dangerous and manipulative perpetrator"". Lisa Thompson, from the Rape and Sexual Violence Project charity, said the decision was ""a massive failure of women who courageously went to the police in the first place and had then gone to court"". Specialist abuse lawyer Richard Scorer, whose firm represented 11 of the victims, said the Parole Board must reveal whether ""manipulative"" Worboys ""has finally admitted his crimes and shown any remorse"". Chair of the House of Commons Home Affairs Committee Yvette Cooper has called for the Parole Board to publish its decisions, although Prof Hardwick said the board was forbidden by law from disclosing such details. A cross party group of 58 MPs has also written to the Secretary of State for Justice David Lidington calling for investigation into whether the voices of Worboys's victims were heard during the decision to release him. This video can not be played Former solicitor general tells Today the parole board will have assessed rationally John Worboys Prof Hardwick said he wanted to make the Parole Board's decisions more transparent and he would ""welcome the backing of MPs to do that"". But he said a consultation was required first ""as it was not straightforward process"". Worboys told his victims he had won the lottery and invited them to celebrate with him Worboys, a former stripper from Rotherhithe, south-east London, targeted young women who had been drinking in the West End of London After deceiving them with a ruse that he had won the lottery, he produced champagne and a carrier bag stuffed with cash, before inviting them to celebrate with him. But the alcohol was laced with powerful sedatives, and once the drugs had taken hold he attacked the women in the back of his cab. Worboys was convicted in 2009 of 19 charges of drugging and sexually assaulting 12 passengers and one charge of rape. He was given an indeterminate sentence of imprisonment for public protection (IPP) and told he would not be released until parole officials were convinced he did not pose a threat to women. Worboys wasordered to serve at least eight years in jail,external. When he is released from prison later this month he will have spent a decade in custody, including a period on remand. IPP sentences were abolished in 2012 after it emerged that they were being used more widely than intended, but the decision was not applied retrospectively to more than 6,000 IPP prisoners - including Worboys - who were behind bars at that time. Malcolm Fowler, a retired solicitor with 48 years' experience, said Worboys ""would be anything but a free man"" on his release from prison. The 60 year old will be subject to licence conditions including weekly reporting to his supervisor. Any breach of his conditions could lead to his recall to prison. Why was Worboys released now?

"Only iPhones and Macs running the very latest operating system software are safe from the Meltdown bug Apple has said that all iPhones, iPads and Mac computers are affected by two major flaws in computer chips. It emerged this weekthat tech companies have been racing to fix the Meltdown and Spectre bugs, that could allow hackers to steal data. Billions of PCs, smartphones and tablets around the world are affected - Apple has now confirmed its products are too. The firm has released some patches to mitigate the Meltdown flaw. It said there was no evidence that either vulnerability had been exploited yet, but advised downloading software only from trusted sources to avoid ""malicious"" apps. Mac users have often believed that their devices and operating systems are less vulnerable to security issues than, for example Android phones or computers running Microsoft systems.

Meltdown does not affect the Apple Watch, it said. Patches against Spectre, in the form of an update to web browser Safari, will be released ""in the coming days"". Google and Microsoft have already issued statements telling users which products are affected by the bugs. Google,externalsaid its Android phones - which make up more than 80% of the global market - were protected if users had the latest security updates.

"This video can not be played Unilever is to end Colman's mustard production after 160 years in Norwich Mustard maker Colman's is to leave its base in Norwich where the condiment has been produced for 160 years. Colman's, which employs 113 people at its site in the city, will move its production to Burton-on-Trent and Germany. The GMB union described the closure as ""absolutely devastating news"". The union said 43 jobs would be transferred to the Burton site, with 20 moving to a new facility opening in Norwich for milling mustard seeds. Fears of a closure had been raised whenBritvic, which shares the site in Carrow with Colman's, announced in October it was leavingand transferring its production of Robinsons and Fruit Shoot elsewhere in the UK. Colman's said in December it had reviewed its operations in light of Britvic's closure proposal. The firm, which has been making mustard at the site since 1858, became part of Unilever's Van Den Bergh Foods in 1995. Unilever said in a statement it recognised it would be ""difficult news"" for staff and the people of Norwich but added it was ""committed to supporting"" its employees. The factory is due to close at the end of next year. Unilever said the vast majority of products currently made in Norwich would still be produced in the UK, with only the packing of dry sauce mixes switching to Germany. It said it would also be keeping the ""Colman's of Norwich"" part of its branding. The Colman's factory has been on the site since 1858 Production line workers at the Colman's works in 1908 Colman's advertising in evidence as workers build Norwich City's new Carrow Road ground in 1935 Jeremiah James Colman established the Norwich factory in 1858 after his great-uncle Jeremiah started a mustard and flour business in nearby Stoke Holy Cross in 1814 Jon Strachan, vice president of Unilever in the UK, said moving some operations to Burton was the ""best option"" for the company. He added: ""We wanted to maintain the historic link between Colman's and Norwich and therefore we are also proposing that we invest in a new state-of-the-art-facility in the local area where we will mill and pack our mustard powder and also process our mint. ""That will ensure that we continue to source and grow our mint and mustard here locally, which we've done for generations."" Clive Lewis, Labour MP for Norwich South, described recent weeks as a ""truly awful festive period for hundreds of Norwich food manufacturing workers and their families"". Chloe Smith, the Conservative MP for Norwich North, said Unilever's decision was ""bitterly disappointing"". A consortium of mustard and mint growers from Norfolk, Cambridgeshire and Lincolnshire has said it will enter into a new long-term partnership with Unilever. David Martin, chief executive of the Grower's Consortium, said: ""This partnership will allow us to jointly develop a new state-of-the-art facility near Norwich. ""We expect that the facility will create around 25 jobs and will open up new possibilities for the future.""

"The German lawmaker denies that he made the comments about Noah Becker (right) The son of German tennis champion Boris Becker is pressing charges against Jens Maier of the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party, his lawyer says. It comes after a tweet posted to the politician's Twitter account called the 23-year-old a ""little half-negro"". Noah Becker has an African-American grandfather on his mother's side. Mr Maier has denied writing the tweet, which has since been deleted. He blamed one of his staff members. The tweet was written in response to an interview Noah Becker gave in which he described Berlin as ""a white city"" compared to other European capitals, and said he had been attacked there because of his skin colour. The artist and musician also discussed his experience growing up with a three-time Wimbledon champion as a father. The DJ is the son of tennis champion Becker and his ex-wife Barbara Becker ""It seems the little half-negro simply got too little attention - that's the only explanation for his behaviour,"" the message posted to Mr Maier's account on Tuesday said, in German.

"This video can not be played Some fear the cost of the levy will be passed on to the consumer MPs are calling for a 25p ""latte levy"" on disposable coffee cups - and a total ban unless recycling improves. Areport by the Environmental Audit Committee,externalsays the tax should be used to improve the UK's recycling and reprocessing facilities. The MPs say throwaway cups should be prohibited altogether by 2023 if they are not all being recycled. In response, Starbucks said it would try out a 5p cup charge in 20 to 25 central London outlets. ""We will begin the trial in February and initially it will last for three months,"" the firm said, adding that it continued to offer a 25p discount to customers who brought their own reusable cups. The government agrees plastic waste is a problem and will seek evidence on a tax on single-use plastics. The committee's chair, Mary Creagh MP, said: ""The UK throws away 2.5 billion disposable coffee cups every year - that's enough to circle the planet five and a half times. ""Almost none are recycled and half a million a day are littered. Coffee cup producers and distributors have not taken action to rectify this and government has sat on its hands. ""The UK's coffee shop market is expanding rapidly, so we need to kick start a revolution in recycling."" Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall: 'Wanton Waste' Four solutions to the disposable coffee cup problem Cup waste: What are coffee chains doing? The Liberal Democrats said they had been campaigning for a charge on coffee cups since September 2016 and were the only party to include the policy in their 2017 election manifesto. The party's environment spokesman, Tim Farron, said: ""I'm glad our call for a coffee cup charge is gaining traction. ""The evidence is clear that these levies work - the 5p charge on plastic bags has massively reduced usage and helped protect our environment."" The proposed 25p levy is being opposed by the makers of paper cups. Mike Turner, of the Paper Cup Alliance, said paper cups were the most sustainable and safe solution for drinks on the go. ""The paper cups we manufacture in the UK are sustainably sourced, responsibly produced, recyclable and, through a number of facilities, are being recycled. We are committed to increasing recycling rates,"" he said. ""Taxing the morning coffee run will not address the issue of litter, but it will hurt consumers and impact already struggling High Streets."" The MPs point out that while some coffee shops offer discounts for customers who bring their own cup, only 1 to 2% of coffee drinkers respond. Following the success of the plastic bag charge, they have concluded that consumers respond more to sticks than to carrots. The plastic lining in coffee cups makes them costly to recycle, and the MPs say the businesses supplying and producing them do not bear the full costs of their disposal. Disposable coffee cups are technically recyclable, but most are not because the UK has just three facilities that can split the paper and plastic components for recycling. The committee has called on the government to require coffee cups from cafes without in-store recycling systems to carry ""not widely recycled"" labels to increase consumer awareness. Cafes with in-store recycling systems should print their cups with ""recyclable in store only"", the MPs add. Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall backs the 'latte levy' The committee's recommendations were welcomed by environmental campaigners. Fiona Nicholls from Greenpeace UK, said the problem was getting bigger: ""We must not allow the packaging industry to water down these recommendations any further."" Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall, chef and campaigner, said: ""The UK has woken up and smelled the coffee cup nightmare. ""The committee has recognised that the huge mountain of disposable coffee cups is effectively unrecyclable, and is overwhelming and disrupting the nation's waste disposal systems, ultimately polluting our rivers and seas, and needs urgent action."" The British Coffee Association's Chris Stemman also welcomed the report's broad principles, but said a levy was not the answer. ""It places an unfair and additional cost on coffee drinking consumers only - despite paper cups only contributing 0.7% of total paper packaging waste,"" he told BBC News. ""We urge the government to ensure that if any potential tax is considered, that it is ring-fenced and used specifically to invest in new 'binfrastructure' and to improve recycling processes with local authorities that make it easier to separate and stream paper cups and other waste products."" Mr Stemman said the industry should continue to focus on other environmental issues such as cutting water use, carbon reduction, and turning waste coffee grounds into biofuel. The government plans to produce a new plastics policy later in the year.

" These are just some of the characters involved in a complex smuggling racket that is almost impossible to police because it crosses so many borders and involves countless criminals. Between 2007-14, rhino poaching rose 9000%. The very existence of the species is threatened by organised crime. Source: South Africa Department for Environmental Affairs Warning: This piece contains images that may be upsetting to some people. Rhino poaching networks are typical of the structure of the new mafias in the global marketplace. The term mafia used to conjure up images of Marlon Brando as Don Corleone in The Godfather, or Tony Soprano as the head of the mob in New Jersey. But in the early 1990s, mafias started to adapt to the new era of globalisation. And just as multinational corporations are often opaque, spreading their operations across many territories and tax havens with complex supply lines, so too are the new mafias. I started researching the rise of this new form of transnational organised crime 14 years ago. During my travels around the globe talking to criminals and law enforcement officials, I realised how new mafias often operate like franchises. James Norton stars inMcMafia, the drama based on Misha Glenny's 2008 non-fiction book exploring global crime networks. The series is on Sunday at 21:00 GMT on BBC One. Mark Galeotti, an expert on transnational crime and security in Russia, explained how it worked. One of the most powerful organised crime groups in Moscow was the Chechen mafia, many of whose members hailed from the lawless Russian republic of Chechnya. “The Chechen mafia became a brand name, a franchise - McMafia if you like,” he explained. “They would sell the moniker ‘Chechen’ to protection rackets in other towns provided they paid, of course, and provided they always carried out their word. If a group claimed a Chechen connection, but didn’t carry out its threats to the letter, it was devaluing the brand. The original Chechens would come after them.” This model started in Russia in the 1990s but it has now spread around the world across a range of criminal enterprises - everything from the Colombian drug cartels to Vietnamese groups trading in endangered wildlife species. And then you have the emergence of the “mafia state” - a country run by and for a powerful clique or network of corrupt politicians and state intelligence officials with close links to organised criminal networks. Russia under Vladimir Putin has often been accused of this. So has North Korea. In the case of Kim Jong-un’s regime, it’s because North Korea can’t or won’t integrate into the global financial system. As long as sanctions continue against Pyongyang, the only way it can obtain hard currency is through nefarious means. North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un In 2015, police in the Mozambican capital, Maputo, arrested a group of men and confiscated rhino horn, a large sum of dollars, a small amount of local currency, and, rather strangely, four sacks of rice. Two of the arrested men were North Koreans who claimed to be diplomats based in South Africa. Their bail was set at $30,000, which they deposited before promptly fleeing the country. A number of North Korea’s African embassies form a nexus of illicit trade in rhino horn, cigarettes and minerals” The investigative reporter Julian Rademeyer spotted a news report about the arrests and started delving deeper, eventually publishing the landmark studyDiplomats and Deceit. When I visited Rademeyer in Johannesburg, I was shocked to hear about the extent of North Korea’s involvement in the trade as he had detailed in his report. “A number of North Korea’s African embassies form a nexus of illicit trade in rhino horn, cigarettes and minerals,” he wrote. Rademeyer explains further “that the diplomats are working under the auspices of Bureau 38, a shadowy government department whose sole purpose is to accrue hard currency”. He also predicted that: “Increasingly stringent economic sanctions designed to cripple North Korea’s nuclear weapons capabilities will likely fuel the expansion of the regime’s illicit activities and state-sponsored criminal networks.” The average ambassadorial salary in the North Korean foreign service is about $1,000 (£740) a month, which in most capitals is not enough to live on. So, in addition to finding hard currency for their bosses in Pyongyang, they have a huge incentive to add to their own salaries. Over time, North Korean diplomats have been busted for selling untaxed alcohol and cigarettes, for dealing heroin and methamphetamines, and for trafficking women for sexual purposes. South Korea estimates that trade in illicit goods and services provides North Korea with revenues of almost $1bn a year. In 2006, defectors from North Korea made the unexpected claim that the late dictator, Kim Jong-il, had decided to end his country’s engagement in the narcotics trade. Apparently, he felt the trade was damaging his country’s reputation unduly. That’s one theory. The other is that the government in Beijing was concerned about the rising rates of drug addiction in China and applied pressure accordingly. An end to drug trafficking meant that the diplomats could no longer meet their financial obligations by, say, smuggling 3,000 tabs of amphetamines in a diplomatic bag. That was when North Koreans based in Africa spotted a market opportunity. The rising wealth of the Chinese and Vietnamese middle classes was reviving demand for rhino horn. Back in the early 2000s, rhino horn didn’t feature on the list of illicit goods and services favoured by the new transnational crime gangs. They were more likely to be selling women, drugs and arms. Rhino horn shavings In the two decades before 2008, authorities in southern Africa as well as in China and Yemen, the two most important markets, appeared to have successfully eradicated most of the trade in rhino horn as well as in ivory. But rhino hornhas continued to be in demand. Powdered horn has been used in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) for more than four millennia. Carved into hilts for traditional daggers known as jambiyas, rhino horn was also in high demand in Yemen during the 1970s and 1980s. Small pockets of demand remain but buyers cannot compete with the high prices offered in south-east Asia. Rhino horn is often used in the hilt of traditional Yemeni daggers known as jambiyas Numbers of both rhinos and elephants were growing at a healthy pace and the threat to some species had been downgraded by Cites, the global regulator for endangered wildlife. But in 2008, the number of rhinos slaughtered for their horns suddenly began to shoot up ata dizzying pace. Rhino horn is now more valuable than cocaine, heroin or gold. Depending on where it is sold, the horn can fetch between $25,000 and $60,000 per kilo. The profits in this trade are phenomenal. The nexus of impoverished Africans and corrupt officials working in tandem with East Asian criminals and spies poses a particular problem to traditional law enforcement and requires huge amounts of resources that most African states don’t possess. “Big Joe” Nyalunga is currently awaiting trial with a group of other defendants oncharges of rhino poaching. Big Joe is a former South African police inspector so he is familiar with the legal system. He was arrested as far back as December 2012 but for much of the time since he has been out on bail. He is now scheduled to go on trial in the spring of 2018. He denies all the charges against him. Big Joe is alleged to be what’s known as a “kingpin”. The kingpins organise rhino poaching in rural communities where the locals are desperately poor and know how to track and hunt wildlife. They sell the horn to middlemen who export the product, usually to East Asia. Here they are either made into lucky trinkets or used in traditional medicine in an attempt to cure everything from cancer to impotence. Prosecutors allege that Big Joe has made huge profits from this trade over the years. Ansie Venter has developed a reputation as one of the most tenacious prosecutors of wildlife crimes in South Africa and she’s been trying to get Big Joe into the dock for some years. “I don’t like the publicity I get for this work but I am prepared to put up with it in order to protect the poor rhinos,” she told me. Kruger National Park, South Africa: Investigators examine the carcass of a rhino killed for its horn Venter describes just how nasty these crimes are. These majestic beasts are immobilised with high-powered hunting rifles before having their horns sawn off while still alive and conscious. They are then left to bleed slowly to death. The poachers don’t want to kill them immediately because a dead rhino will attract vultures and that in turn alerts the rangers. But kingpins are often regarded as Robin Hood figures by the people who work for them in South Africa, neighbouring Zimbabwe and Mozambique. The rural poor resent the fact that considerable resources go into protecting wild animals for the benefit of wealthy white tourists while their communities are left to rot. [Poachers] are usually uneducated, poor people at the low end of the food chain who are simply desperate for an income” Kingpins don’t have any problem recruiting from the villages around South Africa’s huge Kruger National Park where most of the big game can be found and where tourists spend thousands of pounds for the privilege of looking at them. Venter tells me about a poacher she had prosecuted called Elliot Mzimba. Sentenced to seven years in prison, the 43-year-old father-of-six came from a part of rural Mozambique which borders the Kruger National Park. Venter says that Mzimba was typical of the kind of defendants who come before her: “They are usually uneducated, poor people at the low end of the food chain who are simply desperate for an income.” The Kruger, which is roughly the size of Wales, has a border with Zimbabwe. The national park is also home to the largest concentration of rhinos anywhere in the world. Once the breadbasket of Africa, Zimbabwe was hit by a double whammy after the turn of the millennium. Firstly, Robert Mugabe’s land reform programme led to the closure of many profitable commercial farms and a dramatic rise in rural unemployment. This was followed in 2008 by the global financial crash and a collapse in commodity prices on which Zimbabwe depended so heavily for foreign currency. The economic chaos persuaded some Zimbabweans to turn to rhino poaching to augment their incomes. But Zimbabwe was home to relatively few of these animals. When the global crash came, Zimbabwean poachers cast their eyes over the border. “In South Africa, the situation was quite lax,” one of the poachers explained, “so we decided to move to that side. Here in Zim the number of rhinos are low not like in South Africa.” And the Zimbabweans weren’t the only foreigners with their eyes on South Africa’s big game. Around the same time, East Asians also started to appear in and around the Kruger. These included not just North Korean diplomats, but even more bizarrely, Thai lap dancing girls and Vietnamese gangsters. Indeed among the people originally arrested along with Big Joe Nyalunga were two Vietnamese citizens. For the very rich it’s still possible to legally kill big game in South Africa - including rhinos, elephants and lions - in “trophy hunts”. The traditional clients tend to be wealthy European or American middle-aged men - trophy-hunting made headlines when Minnesota dentist Walter Palmer killed Cecil the lion in Zimbabwe. Amateur hunter Walter Palmer (l) poses with a lion (not Cecil) But in 2006, the South African organisers of these deadly safaris noticed a new type of clientele - Vietnamese “businessmen” and, even more incongruously, young women from Thailand. Neither the Vietnamese nor the Thais had the skills to shoot big game. Instead, they employed local marksmen to take down the beasts. The young women in skimpy safari outfits would then pose for selfies in front of the slaughtered animals. It later transpired that the Thai women worked as dancers and sex workers in the bars of Johannesburg and were being employed by Vietnamese and Laotians for extra cash on the side. The criminologist Annette Hübschle explained that a Laotian wildlife trafficking network used a company as a front. As a clever cost-saving measure, “the Thai representative... in South Africa recruited Thai sex workers… to accompany him and his South African intermediaries to private hunting reserves and farms to act as stand-ins for trophy hunters. The wildlife traffickers thus saved on financing travel costs from south-east Asia to South Africa,” she explained. One former rhino trader turned whistleblower said: “The women were paid 5,000 rand (£300; $400) each for taking part in the hunt. Many of them have been trafficked to South Africa and were trying to pay off the debts that bound them to their pimps.” This intersection of two criminal trades is a common feature of the modern mafias. Another feature of the new global mafias is that they’re multi-million dollar enterprises which are often better resourced than the law enforcement agencies charged with chasing them. Poachers use military-style weapons, vehicles and helicopters in pursuit of elephants and rhinos, frustrating the efforts of wildlife rangers to stop them. Khristopher Carlson, a senior researcher at the Small Arms Survey, which studies patterns of armed violence, told a UN meeting that systematic tracing of ammunition found at poaching kill sites in Africa, along with seized weapons, could help track and stop the movement of illicit weapons. South Africa’s Kruger National Park and the private game reserves that surround it have militarised their anti-poaching units - equipping them with aircraft, drones and sophisticated weaponry. Then there's the likes of Vetpaw (Veterans Empowered to Protect African Wildlife), an American charity which sends veterans of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan to Africa to train anti-poaching rangers. You can follow them on Twitter. Burly, heavily armed men in baseball caps, sunglasses and army fatigues post pictures of their captives with captions like “Gotcha!”. Some experts now fear an arms race is developing between poachers and gamekeepers. This ramping up of responses to organised crime isn’t restricted to the rhino trade. The US-led War on Drugs has been going down this route for decades, leading to tens of thousands of deaths in countries such as Mexico, Colombia and Brazil. More recently the European Union has sent in naval vessels to combat the people-smuggling rings based in Libya. The gangs make huge profits transporting African migrants across the Mediterranean in flimsy vessels which sink with terrible regularity. All this reflects growing concern around the world that the culture of McMafia is flourishing as never before. Global crime expert Tuesday Reitano has argued that this “may lock military forces into a long-term crime fighting roles for which they are ill-prepared”. And there’s another concern - that organised crime will just corrupt key individuals in the forces fighting them. Reitano works for The Global Initiative Against Transnational Organized Crime, which is dedicated to reducing the influence of criminal gangs around the world. But she remains worried that the militarisation of the movement to protect rhinos could be backfiring. “Weapons are proliferating across East Africa as a direct result of militarised efforts to counter elephant and rhinoceros poaching,” she said. “We need to understand and assess the possible unintended consequences of these strategies before implementing them.” There is a growing consensus among security specialists and law enforcement officials around the world that transnational organised crime is now one of the top global threats facing us - up there with climate change, pandemics and weapons of mass destruction. But as the fate of the rhino suggests, we are long way from solving this problem.

"This video can not be played Nick Graham: ""Anyone who cares about biodiversity needs to worry about the future of coral reefs"" Repeat bouts of warmer seawater are posing a significant challenge to the world's tropical corals. A study of 100 reefs,published in Science Magazine,external, shows the interval between bleaching events in recent decades has shortened dramatically. It has gone from once every 25-30 years in the early 1980s to an average of just once every six years today. Bleaching is caused by anomalously warm water, which prompts coral polyps to eject their symbiotic algae. This drains the corals of their colour and is fatal unless conditions are reversed in a reasonably short time. But even if temperatures fall back quickly, it can still take many years for damaged reefs to fully recover. ""If you go into the ring with a heavyweight boxer, you could probably stand up for one round, but once that second round comes - you're going down,"" said Dr Mark Eakin from the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (Noaa).

"New car sales fell for the first time in six years last year, with demand for diesel cars plunging by almost a fifth. In total, there were about 2.5 million cars registered, according to industry body the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT). The figure was down 5.7% from 2016, while diesel sales fell 17.1% as higher taxes and pollution fears hit demand. CO2 emissions from new cars increased for the first time in 20 years, up 0.8% on 2016. SMMT chief executive Mike Hawes said the drop in diesel sales was ""the prime cause"" of the rise in CO2 emissions and that the latest low-emission diesels were ""vital"" in meeting climate change targets. He said he expected car sales to continue to drop this year, predicting a 5% to 7% fall. What's gone wrong in the UK car market? Car sales: six charts that tell a story How toxic is your car exhaust? What does the diesel change mean for you? Mr Hawes blamed the sales fall on declining business and consumer confidence, but pointed out last year's performance followed two years of record sales. ""We need to put it into context. This was still the third best year in a decade and the sixth best ever,"" he added. Mr Hawes said that confusion about the future of diesel had fuelled a backlash against diesel cars. Diesel vehicles produce the overwhelming majority of nitrogen oxide gases coming from roadside sources. It's fair to say the steep decline in demand for diesel cars is causing both frustration and consternation within the motor industry. The industry needs to sell diesels, because they are generally more fuel-efficient than petrol cars and therefore produce less carbon dioxide. That helps car companies to meet targets for reducing CO2, introduced in order to combat climate change. But concern about the level of nitrogen oxides (NOx)  they produce has made them a favourite target for clean air campaigners. The industry talks about a short-sighted backlash against new technology, which is encouraging people to stick with older, dirtier cars - and preventing sales of newer, cleaner models. But it's worth remembering where the backlash against diesel really began:with the VW scandal. It didn't just expose deliberate wrongdoing at one company, it also showed how many diesel cars, which had passed official tests, were routinely producing much higher levels of toxic emissions when driven on the roads. So you could argue that carmakers really have themselves to blame. Diesel car sales fell by almost a third in December afterNovember's Budget which introduced a levy on new diesel carsthat failed to meet the latest emissions standards. Experts said the one-off tax increase - which comes into effect in April - would be applied to most new diesels. Mr Hawes said that for many drivers, diesel was still ""the best bet because they can save a lot of money and indeed have a lower CO2 emission"". ""The backlash against diesel has made it far harder for us - and the government - to meet our climate change targets,"" he said. A government spokesperson said: ""Our ambitious Clean Growth Strategy sets out the UK's position as a world-leader in cutting carbon emissions to combat climate change while driving economic growth. ""This includes investing nearly Â£1.5bn in accelerating the rollout of ultra-low emission vehicles by 2020 - generating business opportunities and leading to cleaner air and lower greenhouse gas emissions."" Sales of alternatively fuelled vehicles, including electric and hybrid vehicles, saw a rise of 34.8% to almost 120,000. Environmental campaigner Tony Juniper told the BBC's Today programme that demand for electric cars was increasing ""at a rate that's defying predictions that were being made five or 10 years ago"". ""Partly this is being driven by the kinds of awareness around air pollution, but also climate change,"" he added. However, Mr Hawes told the programme that while electric cars were seen as the future, they still accounted for a very small proportion of total sales. Out of the 2.5 million vehicles sold in the UK in 2017, just 13,500 were battery electric, he said. ""It's growing, it's growing rapidly, but you can see the scale of the challenge,"" he added.

"This video can not be played Nick Graham: ""Anyone who cares about biodiversity needs to worry about the future of coral reefs"" Repeat bouts of warmer seawater are posing a significant challenge to the world's tropical corals. A study of 100 reefs,published in Science Magazine,external, shows the interval between bleaching events in recent decades has shortened dramatically. It has gone from once every 25-30 years in the early 1980s to an average of just once every six years today. Bleaching is caused by anomalously warm water, which prompts coral polyps to eject their symbiotic algae. This drains the corals of their colour and is fatal unless conditions are reversed in a reasonably short time. But even if temperatures fall back quickly, it can still take many years for damaged reefs to fully recover. ""If you go into the ring with a heavyweight boxer, you could probably stand up for one round, but once that second round comes - you're going down,"" said Dr Mark Eakin from the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (Noaa). ""The acceleration in the return rate of bleaching events matches up very well with what the climate models have been telling us.

"Former UKIP leader Nigel Farage is to meet the EU's chief Brexit negotiator in Brussels next Monday. He wrote to Michel Barnier in October to request a meeting, the day after Mr Barnier met three high-profile pro-EU politicians from the UK. Mr Farage said Mr Barnier was listening to people ""who want to stop or delay Brexit"" while he would represent the 17.4 million who voted for it. The two men will meet on Monday at the European Commission headquarters. The MEP confirmed he had ""finally got my meeting with Monsieur Barnier""in a video on Twitter,external, in which he asked his followers to send in their questions for Mr Barnier and said he would pick the best three. Mr Farage, who has campaigned for 20 years to take the UK out of the EU, wrote to Mr Barnier after the Brexit negotiator received a visit from Tory MP Ken Clarke, former Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg and Labour former minister Lord Adonis in October. Mr Clegg had told reporters the three were there to ""get a better understanding"" about what was going on in the negotiations - asked if they were there to stop Brexit he replied: ""If only it were that easy."" The European Commission said at the time that Mr Barnier's ""door was ""always open"" but added: ""There are two negotiators - on the one side the Secretary of State for Exiting the EU, David Davis, and on the European side it's the chief negotiator of the EU, Michel Barnier. Nobody else."" James McGrory of the pro-EU Open Britain group suggested that Mr Farage going to Brussels was ""like sending an arsonist to put out a house fire"". ""He has no answers to the costs and complexity of Brexit, other than to blithely say we should walk away with no deal, which would be an unmitigated disaster for our economy and our country,"" he said.

"At the busiest times, ambulances - like these at the Royal Albert Edward Infirmary in Wigan - are getting stuck in long queues More than one in eight patients rushed to hospital in an ambulance this winter has faced a delay of more than 30 minutes on arrival, BBC analysis shows. Patients are meant to be handed over to staff within 15 minutes, but more than 75,000 have waited at least twice as long as that in England. Some of the worst waits had lasted up to five hours, ambulance crews said. Doctors warned the delays put patients at risk, as the prime minister apologised for problems in the NHS. Leah Butler-Smith was with her mother, who she thought was having a stroke, when she was caught in a queue outside Broomfield Hospital in Essex this week. ""We weren't moving. We weren't going anywhere,"" she said. Leah Butler-Smith's mother was stuck in a queue outside an A&E unit Ambulances queuing this week outside Broomfield Hospital in Essex Her mother kept falling in and out of consciousness, while she and her sister tried to keep her spirits up. Ambulances continued arriving, making them scared they would be bumped for more urgent cases. ""It's just gobsmacking,"" Leah said. She said it was too soon to know what affect the delay had had on her mother's health. ""The staff are doing all they can. There just aren't the funds for the beds,"" she said. Dr Ellen Makings, medical director at Mid Essex Services NHS Trust, said she was ""extremely sorry"" for the waits experienced on that day. ""Our staff were working extremely hard to ensure that all patients were safe at all times. ""Whilst it was far from ideal for this patient to have an extended stay in the ambulance she was cared for throughout by experienced paramedics and was assessed by a qualified emergency department sister within 30 minutes of arrival, and then again by an emergency department consultant at one hour 50 minutes."" She added once Leah's mother had been assessed and had a scan it emerged she had not had a stroke. Instead she was diagnosed with a stroke mimic, where a patient presents with stroke-like symptoms but has not actually had one. Operation delays: 'Everything is up in the air' People on beds 'as far as you could see' Dr Taj Hassan, president of the Royal College of Emergency Medicine, said the problems being seen were ""not surprising"". ""A&E units are over-crowded, so staff just cannot take care of these patients and ambulance crews have to stay with them. ""It means they face longer delays for all the assessments they should get. It is a risk, but there is nothing we can do about it."" Figures from Public Health England show there was a sharp rise in hospital admissions in England for confirmed flu cases in the last week of December, and PHE bosses said this was contributing to pressure on the NHS. This video can not be played Theresa May: ""I apologise"" for NHS difficulties The analysis of handover delays by the BBC is based on official NHS figures for 20 November to 31 December. They happen when A&E staff are not available to take care of patients brought in. Some have to wait in the back of ambulances, although many end up in waiting areas and side rooms until nurses and doctors become available. The analysis shows: Across England 75,700 ambulances had to wait over 30 minutes - 13% of the total Of those, nearly 17,000 waited over an hour The East Midlands saw the highest proportion of delays, with 20% of crews waiting over 30 minutes, followed by the East of England, with 18% Most ambulances arriving at one hospital trust - Lancashire Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust - were delayed by over 30 minutes, with one in five delayed by over 60 Only six out of more than 130 hospital trusts have not had any delays of over 30 minutes Ged Blezard, director of operations of the North West Ambulance Service, said the delays were causing a ""number of problems"" and compromising the safety of patients. ""We are nursing patients in hospital corridors - and that is affecting our ability to respond to patients in the community. It is happening on a daily basis,"" he added. He said there were sometimes between 12 and 15 ambulances queuing outside A&E units, with some of the delays lasting four or five hours. Patients caught up in the problems said they feared for their health during the waits. Lancashire Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust 53% United Lincolnshire Hospitals NHS Trust 45% The Queen Elizabeth Hospital NHS Trust (Norfolk) 38% East Lancashire Hospitals NHS Trust 34% Southport and Ormskirk Hospital NHS Trust and The Princess Alexandra Hospital NHS Trust (Essex) 29% Labour shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth said the figures showed the ""shocking scale of the crisis in the NHS"" and ministers should be ashamed that patients had been ""left languishing"" like this. Prime Minister Theresa May has apologised for the problems being seen. This week NHS bosses announced the cancellation of tens of thousands of non-urgent operations in an attempt to ease the pressure on hospitals. Mrs May said: ""I know it's difficult, I know it's frustrating, I know it's disappointing for people, and I apologise."" Saffron Cordery, of NHS Providers, which represents hospital managers, said the problems showed the ""strain"" the system was under. ""Despite planning more meticulously than ever before, the level of demand for services means severe pressures remain,"" she said.

Meanwhile, in Scotlandthere has been a 20% jump in A&E attendances compared with the previous year, prompting an increase in patients waiting more than four hours, and in Northern Ireland the Antrim Area Hospital has had to bring in St John Ambulance volunteers to help with a surge in demand.

"Actress and model Lily Cole has spoken about facing ""prejudice"" in a row over her involvement in events to mark the bicentenary of Emily Bronte's birth. Cole has been named ""creative partner"" for the celebrations by the Bronte Parsonage Museum in West Yorkshire. Bronte expert Nick Holland has quit the Bronte Society, saying the Wuthering Heights author would not have approved of a supermodel getting the role. But Cole said the writer would not have judged any work ""on name alone"". In her role, Cole is making a short film for the museum about Wuthering Heights anti-hero Heathcliff. It will also address gender politics and women's rights in the year that marks 100 years since women got the vote. The Bronte sisters - Emily, Charlotte and Anne - initially published their work under pseudonyms so they would be taken seriously by the 19th Century literary establishment. The Bronte sisters originally used the pseudonyms Currer, Ellis, and Acton Bell Cole said the criticism about her involvement made her wonder whether she should present her film under a pseudonym too, ""so that it will be judged on its own merits, rather than on my name, my gender, my image or my teenage decisions"". She said: ""I would not be so presumptuous as to guess Emily's reaction to my appointment as a creative partner at the museum, were she alive today. ""Yet I respect her intellect and integrity enough to believe that she would not judge any piece of work on name alone."" Cole, 30, made her name as a model in her teens, and has had acting roles in the 2007 St Trinian's film and Channel 5's Elizabeth I. She graduated from Cambridge University with a double first in History of Art and is, she says, ""an advocate for sociopolitical and environmental issues"" through her skill-sharing app Impossible. Emily Bronte bicentenary events unveiled Lily Cole - from model to activist St Trinian's: Where are they now? Nick Holland, who has published books on the literary sisters,wrote on his blog,external: ""The central question should be, what would Emily Bronte think if she found that the role of chief 'artist' and organiser in her celebratory year was a supermodel? ""We all know the answer to that, and anyone who doesn't isn't fit to make the decision or have any role in the governance of the Bronte Society."" The Society, which runs the museum in Haworth, should have appointed a writer instead, he argued. He concluded: ""It's best that I leave the society now, before they announce James Corden as the creative partner for 2019, a year in which Patrick Bronte is being remembered, and Rita Ora as organiser for Anne Bronte's celebrations in 2020."" The Bronte Society said Cole's ""innovative projects in the fields of literacy, nature, story-telling and the environment"" made her a ""perfect fit for Emily"". Public art installation in free speech row Apple: Chip flaw in all Macs and iPhones Mystery powder paralyses backpackers 2018 offers us both the 100th anniversary of women's suffrage in the UK, and the 200th anniversary of Emily Bronte's birth, so it feels poignant to begin the year on the topic of prejudice. Emily Bronte, whose extraordinary novel Wuthering Heights has stirred the world for over 150 years, published her work under an androgynous pseudonym: Ellis Bell. Writing in 1850, Charlotte Bronte explained why she and her sisters Emily and Anne all used pseudonyms: ""We did not like to declare ourselves women, because we had a vague impression that authoresses are liable to be looked on with prejudice."" When I was asked by the Bronte Parsonage Museum to work on a piece to commemorate Emily Bronte's birth, I immediately thought of Emily's pseudonym, and what that gesture represented. Why could a woman not publish under her own name? What was life like for women living in the UK in the 19th Century? What circumstances would also give rise to a child being found abandoned in a city in the 18th Century, as Heathcliff was? Now I find myself wondering, fleetingly, if I should present the short film I am working on for the Bronte Parsonage Museum under a pseudonym myself, so that it will be judged on its own merits, rather than on my name, my gender, my image or my teenage decisions. I would not be so presumptuous as to guess Emily's reaction to my appointment as a creative partner at the museum, were she alive today. Yet I respect her intellect and integrity enough to believe that she would not judge any piece of work on name alone. In the meantime I am excited to see how much Emily still means to so many people, and I welcome 2018 to celebrate her.

"This video can not be played Unilever is to end Colman's mustard production after 160 years in Norwich Mustard maker Colman's is to leave its base in Norwich where the condiment has been produced for 160 years. Colman's, which employs 113 people at its site in the city, will move its production to Burton-on-Trent and Germany. The GMB union described the closure as ""absolutely devastating news"". The union said 43 jobs would be transferred to the Burton site, with 20 moving to a new facility opening in Norwich for milling mustard seeds. Fears of a closure had been raised whenBritvic, which shares the site in Carrow with Colman's, announced in October it was leavingand transferring its production of Robinsons and Fruit Shoot elsewhere in the UK. Colman's said in December it had reviewed its operations in light of Britvic's closure proposal. The firm, which has been making mustard at the site since 1858, became part of Unilever's Van Den Bergh Foods in 1995. Unilever said in a statement it recognised it would be ""difficult news"" for staff and the people of Norwich but added it was ""committed to supporting"" its employees. The factory is due to close at the end of next year. Unilever said the vast majority of products currently made in Norwich would still be produced in the UK, with only the packing of dry sauce mixes switching to Germany. It said it would also be keeping the ""Colman's of Norwich"" part of its branding.

He added: ""We wanted to maintain the historic link between Colman's and Norwich and therefore we are also proposing that we invest in a new state-of-the-art-facility in the local area where we will mill and pack our mustard powder and also process our mint. ""That will ensure that we continue to source and grow our mint and mustard here locally, which we've done for generations.""

Chloe Smith, the Conservative MP for Norwich North, said Unilever's decision was ""bitterly disappointing"". A consortium of mustard and mint growers from Norfolk, Cambridgeshire and Lincolnshire has said it will enter into a new long-term partnership with Unilever. David Martin, chief executive of the Grower's Consortium, said: ""This partnership will allow us to jointly develop a new state-of-the-art facility near Norwich.

"At the busiest times, ambulances - like these at the Royal Albert Edward Infirmary in Wigan - are getting stuck in long queues More than one in eight patients rushed to hospital in an ambulance this winter has faced a delay of more than 30 minutes on arrival, BBC analysis shows. Patients are meant to be handed over to staff within 15 minutes, but more than 75,000 have waited at least twice as long as that in England. Some of the worst waits had lasted up to five hours, ambulance crews said. Doctors warned the delays put patients at risk, as the prime minister apologised for problems in the NHS. Leah Butler-Smith was with her mother, who she thought was having a stroke, when she was caught in a queue outside Broomfield Hospital in Essex this week. ""We weren't moving. We weren't going anywhere,"" she said. Leah Butler-Smith's mother was stuck in a queue outside an A&E unit Ambulances queuing this week outside Broomfield Hospital in Essex Her mother kept falling in and out of consciousness, while she and her sister tried to keep her spirits up. Ambulances continued arriving, making them scared they would be bumped for more urgent cases. ""It's just gobsmacking,"" Leah said. She said it was too soon to know what affect the delay had had on her mother's health. ""The staff are doing all they can. There just aren't the funds for the beds,"" she said. Dr Ellen Makings, medical director at Mid Essex Services NHS Trust, said she was ""extremely sorry"" for the waits experienced on that day. ""Our staff were working extremely hard to ensure that all patients were safe at all times. ""Whilst it was far from ideal for this patient to have an extended stay in the ambulance she was cared for throughout by experienced paramedics and was assessed by a qualified emergency department sister within 30 minutes of arrival, and then again by an emergency department consultant at one hour 50 minutes."" She added once Leah's mother had been assessed and had a scan it emerged she had not had a stroke. Instead she was diagnosed with a stroke mimic, where a patient presents with stroke-like symptoms but has not actually had one. Operation delays: 'Everything is up in the air' People on beds 'as far as you could see' Dr Taj Hassan, president of the Royal College of Emergency Medicine, said the problems being seen were ""not surprising"". ""A&E units are over-crowded, so staff just cannot take care of these patients and ambulance crews have to stay with them. ""It means they face longer delays for all the assessments they should get. It is a risk, but there is nothing we can do about it."" Figures from Public Health England show there was a sharp rise in hospital admissions in England for confirmed flu cases in the last week of December, and PHE bosses said this was contributing to pressure on the NHS. This video can not be played Theresa May: ""I apologise"" for NHS difficulties The analysis of handover delays by the BBC is based on official NHS figures for 20 November to 31 December. They happen when A&E staff are not available to take care of patients brought in. Some have to wait in the back of ambulances, although many end up in waiting areas and side rooms until nurses and doctors become available. The analysis shows: Across England 75,700 ambulances had to wait over 30 minutes - 13% of the total Of those, nearly 17,000 waited over an hour The East Midlands saw the highest proportion of delays, with 20% of crews waiting over 30 minutes, followed by the East of England, with 18% Most ambulances arriving at one hospital trust - Lancashire Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust - were delayed by over 30 minutes, with one in five delayed by over 60 Only six out of more than 130 hospital trusts have not had any delays of over 30 minutes Ged Blezard, director of operations of the North West Ambulance Service, said the delays were causing a ""number of problems"" and compromising the safety of patients. ""We are nursing patients in hospital corridors - and that is affecting our ability to respond to patients in the community. It is happening on a daily basis,"" he added. He said there were sometimes between 12 and 15 ambulances queuing outside A&E units, with some of the delays lasting four or five hours. Patients caught up in the problems said they feared for their health during the waits. Lancashire Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust 53% United Lincolnshire Hospitals NHS Trust 45% The Queen Elizabeth Hospital NHS Trust (Norfolk) 38% East Lancashire Hospitals NHS Trust 34% Southport and Ormskirk Hospital NHS Trust and The Princess Alexandra Hospital NHS Trust (Essex) 29% Labour shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth said the figures showed the ""shocking scale of the crisis in the NHS"" and ministers should be ashamed that patients had been ""left languishing"" like this. Prime Minister Theresa May has apologised for the problems being seen. This week NHS bosses announced the cancellation of tens of thousands of non-urgent operations in an attempt to ease the pressure on hospitals. Mrs May said: ""I know it's difficult, I know it's frustrating, I know it's disappointing for people, and I apologise."" Saffron Cordery, of NHS Providers, which represents hospital managers, said the problems showed the ""strain"" the system was under. ""Despite planning more meticulously than ever before, the level of demand for services means severe pressures remain,"" she said.

Problems have also been reported in other parts of the UK. The Welsh government said the health service was facing ""significant pressure"" andthe chief executive of the NHS in Wales apologised to patients whose operations had been postponed. Meanwhile, in Scotlandthere has been a 20% jump in A&E attendances compared with the previous year, prompting an increase in patients waiting more than four hours, and in Northern Ireland the Antrim Area Hospital has had to bring in St John Ambulance volunteers to help with a surge in demand. Correction 14 January 2018: This article has been amended after the Mid Essex Services NHS Trust provided a statement about the care given to Leah Butler-Smith's mother, pointing out when she was seen by an emergency department nurse and consultant.

"Lily Cole said she was ""excited and honoured"" to work on the project A literary expert has resigned from the Bronte Society over a ""rank farce"" decision to appoint a supermodel and actress as its patron for 2018. Lily Colewas chosen by the society as a creative partnerat the Bronte Parsonage Museum for the 200th anniversary of Emily Bronte's birth. Nick Holland, author of books on the Bronte sisters, said such an important role should have gone to a writer. The Bronte Society said it looked forward to working with Cole. More stories from across Yorkshire Mr Holland, 47, from Barnsley, who had been a member of the society for several years, said: ""I think it's a disgrace. ""I understand the society wants to target a younger audience but this is going about it the wrong way and risks diluting the work and legacy of Emily Bronte."" An oil painting of Wuthering Heights author Emily Bronte published in 1847 In hisblog post,externallast month, Mr Holland said: ""The central question should be, what would Emily Bronte think if she found that the role of chief 'artist' and organiser in her celebratory year was a supermodel? ""We all know the answer to that, and anyone who doesn't isn't fit to make the decision or have any role in the governance of the Bronte Society.""

Nick Holland became interested in works by the Brontes after reading Wuthering Heights at the age of 18 Mr Holland added: ""It's best that I leave the society now before they announce James Corden as the creative partner for 2019, a year in which Patrick Bronte is being remembered, and Rita Ora as organiser for Anne Bronte's celebrations in 2020."" The Bronte Society said: ""Lily's innovative projects in the fields of literacy, nature, story-telling and the environment are the perfect fit for Emily, and her originality and creativity will bring a fresh perspective to our 2018 celebrations.""
