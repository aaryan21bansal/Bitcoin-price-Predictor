"PM Stefan Lofven carries red roses - the Social Democrats emblem - after Friday's TV debate Sweden's Prime Minister Stefan Lofven has begun the final day of the general election campaign by warning about extremism and fascism. Neither his centre-left Social Democrats nor the main centre-right party is likely to win a majority. The anti-immigration Sweden Democrats (SD) is expected to win around 20% of the vote, becoming the second biggest party in parliament. Mr Lofven said an SD vote was ""dangerous"" and ""counterproductive"". He said it was ""like trying to quench fire with alcohol"", according to the Omni news site. Immigration has been a central issue of the election campaigns. The nationalist SD doubled its seats in the 2014 election and it is predicted to double them again on Sunday. On Saturday, SD leader Jimmie Akesson said Sweden had been ""an extreme country in many ways, not least when it comes to immigration"" and that his plan to take in fewer migrants would be regarded as ""normal politics in the rest of Europe"". The SD was linked for years to neo-Nazis and other far-right groups, only entering parliament in 2010. It has been working to rebrand itself, changing its logo from a flaming torch (similar to the one used by the UK far-right National Front) to a blue-and-yellow daisy, the colours of the Swedish flag. Jimmie Akesson of the Sweden Democrats after Friday's heated party-leader debate Sweden Democrats tap into immigration fears Have online bots affected the campaign?,external Traditionally appealing to working-class men, it wants to attract more women and more educated and higher-income voters. Mr Akesson, who became leader in 2005, says there is zero tolerance towards racism in the party and several members have been expelled. However, the party has still been embroiled in various racism scandals. One municipal candidate shared a song on Facebook with the lyrics ""Swedes are white and the country is ours"", according to a report in tabloid Aftonbladet. Last year, some of its ex-members went on to found the far-right Alternative for Sweden (AfS). Sweden's economy is booming but many voters are concerned that housing, healthcare and welfare services have come under pressure from a wave of immigration during the 2015 migrant crisis. That year Sweden took in a record 163,000 asylum seekers - the highest such intake in the EU, per head of population. Sweden's traditional parties have since hardened their tone to reflect concerns about integration. Many voters are also concerned about violence. The SD links a rise in shootings to increased immigration, although official figures show no correlation. Is Malmo the 'rape capital' of Europe? The SD also wants to leave the European Union and has proposed a ""Swexit"" referendum. However, the powerful centrist parties all oppose such a vote, so it is unlikely to go ahead. Aside from immigration, climate change is an issue many Swedes care about - particularly after a long, hot summer and severe forest fires. In pictures: Fighting the Swedish wildfires Sweden country profile During the heatwave, around 25,000 hectares of forest burned in wildfires and many farmers were forced to destroy livestock after their pasture land dried up. This video can not be played Swedish teen's sit-in climate protest Support for the Green party, which had been struggling after various internal scandals, has crept up across the country. The Left party is making gains too, from the environmentally concerned and from centre-left voters dissatisfied with the mainstream parties' approach to migration. Prime Minister Lofven currently heads a minority, centre-left coalition government made up of his Social Democrats and the Green Party. In recent years there has been a fall in support for the Social Democrats and the largest traditional opposition party, the centre-right Moderates. However, polls suggest that the Social Democrats are narrowly ahead of other parties and may be in a position to lead another minority government. Both the Social Democrats and the Moderates have said they will not enter a coalition with the SD, however well they perform.

"QI host Sandi Toksvig is paid 40% of the amount the panel show's former host Stephen Fry used to earn, she has told the Women's Equality Party conference. Her fellow WEP co-founder Catherine Mayertweeted,externalthat there was a ""huge gasp"" in the party conference room as Toksvig responded to a question on pay. Toksvig, 60, took over from Fry in October 2016, who had hosted since 2003. She has filmed three series. Producers Fremantle Media have made no comment on the difference. The company makes the show, which runs on the BBC, and is set to return on Monday. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Answering a question about pay at the party conference, she said she had never wanted the equal pay argument to focus on her, she had a ""nice living"" and did ""very well"". But she added: ""I have recently discovered I get 40% of what Stephen used to get. And I get the same pay as (permanent panellist) Alan Davies, who is not the host. ""I temper this with the fact that I love the show and I'm the first woman to host such a show."" Later, she added: ""I love QI and the brilliant team who produce it. John Lloyd and the (production) team champion women on the show."" The Women's Equality Party (WEP) which she established with Ms Mayer campaigns for women to have the same rights and opportunities as men. Toksvig said she made the comments at the party's conference in answer to a question she felt she had to respond to ""because the issues with equal pay and the gender pay gap cut right across the media and all industries and all areas of life"". ""Until now I had held back from talking about this because this is not about me. ""However, the lack of transparency around pay is a big part of the problem and I hope that being open, I can support women across the country whose work is undervalued."" Toksvig also co-presents the Great British Bake Off. The amount she is paid for either roles has not been released. The BBC press office said: ""QI is made by an independent production company who manage their own talent fees."" Stephen Fry has also yet to comment on his successor's statements.

"Schools should teach a wider range of religious and non-religious views, says the report Religious education in England's schools should be renamed Religion and Worldviews to reflect the diversity of modern Britain, say experts. The subject should include non-religious worldviews as well as major faiths, says the Commission on Religious Education final report. It follows research suggesting at least a quarter of schools break the law on teaching RE. Without an overhaul, the subject could wither, the authors warn. The independent Commission was set up two years ago by the Religious Education Council of England and Wales, amid growing concerns about the quality of RE lessons. These include: Fears that poor RE could leave pupils ignorant or bigoted Evidence that growing numbers of schools do not teach RE Ofsted's finding that RE is less than good in about half of schools The commission's report confirms that the quality of RE in schools is ""highly variable"". There is some excellent practice in some schools. it says, but in others the amount of time allocated to the subject is being squeezed, and the subject is suffering from an across-the-board decline in specialist teachers. ""RE needs rejuvenating if it is to continue to make its important contribution, indeed if it is not to wither on the vine,"" says Commission Chairman, The Very Rev Dr John Hall, Dean of Westminster and a former chief education officer for the Church of England, in his foreword. The new subject would allow pupils to study the different traditions of major religions such as Christianity, Buddhism, Hinduism, Islam, Judaism and Sikhism but alongside these they would also look at non-religious worldviews like humanism, secularism, atheism and agnosticism. ""Life in Britain, indeed life in our world, is very different from life in the 1970s when RE began to include other world religious and beliefs besides Christianity,"" says Dr Hall. He believes it has never been more important for people to understand the main traditions of faith and belief and the wide variety of worldviews, and to ""achieve fluency in relating to people with different traditions and outlooks from their own"". At present, he warns, ""the quality of RE in too many schools is inadequate in enabling pupils to engage deeply with the worldviews they will encounter"". To counter this the commission wants the government to change the law on RE to ensure that all pupils, no matter what type of school they attend - including faith schools and academies - have full access to the proposed Religion and Worldviews curriculum. Schools would have to publish a detailed statement on how they achieve this and Ofsted would have the power to ensure that minimum standards are met. There is a shortage of specialist RE teachers The Church of England's chief education officer, Nigel Genders, agreed that the report's call for a new vision for RE was vital and timely ""if we are to equip children for life in the modern world where religion and belief play such important roles"". However, a spokesman for the Catholic Education Service, while applauding the attempt at improving RE in all schools, said the report failed to produce a consensus on how to achieve this. ""This report is not so much an attempt to improve RE as to fundamentally change its character,"" said the spokesman, who warned the changes risked the subject losing ""all academic value and integrity"". And the Vice President of the Board of Deputies of British Jews, Edwin Shuker,  said the report was ""fundamentally undermined by the dilution of religious education through the inclusion of all worldviews in an already tight teaching timetable"". ""This might be seen as an attempt by those hostile to faith to push their agenda of undermining rigour in religious education at a time when faith literacy could not be more important."" But Andrew Copson, chief executive of Humanists UK, called the recommendations ""a once in a generation opportunity to save the teaching of religious and non-religious worldviews"". ""If the nettle is not grasped, decline will continue and the subject will sink into irrelevance at a time when the need for knowledge and understanding... is more acute than ever. "" Stephen Evans, chief executive of the National Secular Society called the proposals ""significant progress, although the deference to religious interests has limited the commission's ambitions, making its report an inevitable fudge."" Ben Wood, chairman of the National Association of Teachers of RE, said the plan to include non-religious worldviews reflected ""current practice in many schools where RE is taught well"" and looked forward to working with policymakers to take the subject forward. The Department for Education said it will look into the report's recommendations.

"The patient has been receiving treatment at the Royal Free Hospital Monkeypox has been diagnosed in the UK for the first time, a public health body warns. The rare viral infection does not spread easily between humans and most people recover within a few weeks. Public Health England (PHE) said the patient was a resident of Nigeria where the virus was probably contracted. The patient had been staying at a naval base in Cornwall but is now being treated at the infectious diseases unit at the Royal Free Hospital in London. Its experts are working closely with NHS colleagues ""as a precautionary measure"" and will be contacting people who might have been in close contact with the individual to provide information and health advice. This includes contacting a number of passengers who travelled in close proximity to the patient on the same flight to the UK. The patient travelled to London from Nigeria on 2 September and anyone who has not been contacted yet from that flight is advised no further action is required. Monkeypox is usually a mild self-limiting illness and most people recover within a few weeks, however severe illness can occur in some individuals It is a rare disease caused by monkeypox virus, and has been reported mainly in central and west African countries The infection can be spread when someone is in close contact with an infected person, however there is a very low risk of transmission to the general population Initial symptoms include fever, headache, muscle aches, backache, swollen lymph nodes, chills and exhaustion A rash can develop, often beginning on the face, then spreading to other parts of the body. The rash changes and goes through different stages before finally forming a scab, which later falls off Source:Public Health England,external Dr Michael Jacobs, clinical director of infection at the Royal Free Hospital, said monkeypox ""does not spread easily between people and the risk of transmission to the wider public is very low"". ""We are using strict isolation procedures in hospital to protect our staff and patients,"" he added. Dr Nick Phin, the deputy director of the National Infection Service at PHE, said: ""It is important to emphasise that monkeypox does not spread easily between people and the overall risk to the general public is very low. ""Public Health England is following up those who have had close contact with the patient to offer advice and to monitor them as necessary."" He said PHE and the NHS have ""well established and robust infection control procedures for dealing with cases of imported infectious disease and these will be strictly followed to minimise the risk of transmission"".

"This video can not be played The anniversary parade showed off North Korea's military strength North Korea did not display any intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) at a military parade to mark its 70th anniversary, reports say. It is also unclear whether leader Kim Jong-un made a speech at the event. The parade is being scrutinised for clues about North Korea's weapons arsenal and professed commitment to denuclearisation. Some analysts had predicted that Mr Kim would tone down the display after his summit with US President Donald Trump. A large display of ICBMs - which can reach the US mainland, potentially carrying a nuclear warhead - would have been seen as provocative. Kim Jong-un's faith in Trump 'unchanged' Korean reunions: Families divided by war meet in North Why North Korea is in no hurry to please the US N Korea 'making missiles' despite US thaw In June Mr Kim and Mr Trump signed a vague agreement to work towards denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula but it did not include a timeline, details or mechanisms to verify the process. Kim Jong-un (c) appeared alongside visiting Chinese politican Li Zhanshu High-level talks and visits have continued but the most recent scheduled trip byUS Secretary of State Mike Pompeo was called off last minuteand both sides have blamed each other for the stalling negotiations while insisting they're committed to the progress. The BBC's Seoul Correspondent Laura Bicker said any show of ICBMs could have put future discussions and any deal to declare an end to the Korean war at risk. Thousands of troops marched in the parade Participants waved flowers as they passed Mr Kim North Korea was also due to hold its first mass games in five years. The Arirang Mass Games are an elaborate propaganda spectacle with enormous co-ordinated displays. This year's games, which tell a symbolic story of North Korea's history, are titled The Glorious Country. Analysis of satellite images from the past two weeks,externalsuggest this year's games, which will continue throughout September, are going to be very big. Planes drew out the number 70 in the sky, to mark the country's 70th anniversary Past games have featured gigantic stadiums filled with performers, synchronised gymnasts and co-ordinated dance displays.

"Benson portrayed the title role in Shakespeare's Henry VI for a BBC TV adaptation Heartbeat actor Peter Benson, who played Bernie Scripps in the popular ITV series for 18 years, has died, his manager said. Benson died aged 75 on Thursday after a short illness. In the police drama set in the 1960s, he played a funeral director who got into disastrous money-making schemes. He appeared in all 18 series from 1992. Benson also played Henry VII in BBC comedy Blackadder, and appeared more recently in hospital drama, Casualty. As well as his TV work, he was also a skilled singer, dancer and theatre actor who portrayed the title role in Shakespeare's Henry VI in a BBC television adaption of the play in 1983. Former Heartbeat co-star Steven Blakeley, who played PC Geoff Younger in the show, was among those to pay tribute. There would ""never be another like you - talented, kind and gentle in equal measure"", said Blakeley. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Youths wearing gas masks threw stones at police in the city of Thessaloniki, where Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras later spoke about his economic plans. Many Greeks say only the northern Greek region of Macedonia should use the name and not the former Yugoslav state. Macedonians will vote on the name change at the end of the month. Thousands of demonstrators reportedly took part in the protests on the streets of Thessaloniki, many of them waving Greek flags. Images and footage broadcast on Greek television showed riot police pursuing protesters as they ran alongside barriers ahead of Mr Tsipras's address on Saturday. A number of individuals, who broke away from the main group, hurled stones at police officers Some have argued that by using the name Macedonia, the country is implying that it has a claim to the Greek region. Earlier in the Macedonian capital, Skopje, German Chancellor Angela Merkel told Macedonians that they had a historic opportunity with the forthcoming vote to let their nation integrate with Europe and eventually to join Nato and the European Union. Macedonia and Greece: Backlash over name deal Full story: What's the name row about? The makeover that's divided a nation In his keynote speech on Saturday, Mr Tsipras outlined plans for tax cuts, an increase to the country's minimum wage and promised to reinstate labour rights. ""We will not allow Greece to revert to the era of deficits and fiscal derailment,"" he said. In June, Greece reached a deal on the name of its northern neighbour, which called itself Macedonia at the break-up of the former Yugoslavia. After 27 years of talks - and many protests - the two settled on the formal name of Republic of North Macedonia. Greece had earlier objected to the name Macedonia, fearing territorial claims on its eponymous northern region, which includes the country's second city Thessaloniki. It had also vetoed the neighbour's bid to join Nato and the European Union. The new name now needs to be approved by the Macedonian people and the Greek parliament. Under the deal, the country known at the United Nations as Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (Fyrom) will be named the Republic of North Macedonia. Its language will be Macedonian and its people known as Macedonians (citizens of the Republic of North Macedonia). Significantly, they agreed that the new name would be used both internationally and bilaterally, so that even the 140 or more countries that recognise the name Macedonia will also have to adopt North Macedonia. In Macedonian, the name is Severna Makedonija. They also agreed that the English name could be used as well as the Slavic term.

Miller rose to fame after topping US charts with his debut album in 2011. He released his latest record, Swimming, earlier this year and was due to go on tour. The rapper went through a well-publicised break-up with singer and girlfriend Ariana Grande earlier this year. The pair, who met in 2012, collaborated on a number of songs and performed together at the One Love Manchester concert in 2017. Charges were filed against Miller last month after he was arrested in May for driving under the influence and hit and run. Grande spoke out publicly about ending their ""toxic relationship""after fans blamed her for his arrest. Grande suspended comments on her Instagram account on Friday shortly after Miller's death ""I am not a babysitter or a mother and no woman should feel that they need to be,"" she said in a typed message posted on social media. Grande said she had ""tried to support his sobriety"" for years, and was praying that he ""figures it all out"". Born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, Miller began to focus on his music while still at school and released his first mixtape under the name EZ Mac at just 15. Maturing in the public eye, he starred in a MTV reality series in 2013 which followed him and a group of friends after he moved to Los Angeles to pursue his career. He released a series of albums and EPs across the last decade, collaborating with high-profile artists like Pharrell Williams and Kendrick Lamar. In his final tweets posted on Thursday, the rapper promoted the North American tour he was set to embark on next month. He was ""a bright light in this world for his family, friends and fans."" his family said, in a statement confirming his death. Analysis by BBC Music Reporter Mark Savage A lot of rappers don't make beats. A lot of beat-makers can't rap. Mac Miller could do it all, lending an uncommon intimacy to his best songs. He started piano lessons at the age of six, later picking up drums, bass and keyboards. By the age of 15, he'd released his first mixtape, But My Mackin' Ain't Easy, but it was his fourth release, 2010's KIDS, a playful, freewheeling collection of party tunes, that won him a recording contract. Over the years, he shed his frivolous, frat-boy reputation, making increasingly mature, introspective records that dealt with his personal demons; as well as 2016's The Divine Feminine, a naive but affecting (and occasionally too-graphic) concept album about what he called ""the feminine energy of the planet,""  but which many took to be a tribute to his partner, Ariana Grande. The rapper had more than eight million followers on Twitter In music, and in his interviews, he was open about his addictions - which eventually prompted Grande to end their relationship, describing it as a ""toxic relationship"". But Miller refused to exploit their break-up on his latest album, Swimming. ""Everybody wants a headline / I don't got nothin' to say,"" he rapped on Programs, released in May, just weeks after their split was confirmed. Instead, the album documented his ongoing struggles with substance abuse. ""Got my head underwater, but I ain't in the shower, and I ain't getting baptised,"" he confessed on Jet Fuel. The halting vocals and fractured, subdued production made it clear he was suffering but there was always a sense of optimism - a promise that those demons could be beaten. Tragically, it appears he lost the battle. Follow us onFacebook,external, on Twitter@BBCNewsEnts,external, or on Instagram atbbcnewsents,external.

"Actress Brie Larson has said the industry must do more ""to make sure everyone's in the room"" Women of colour are being ""written off"" as film critics, a study into film reviewers' demographic profiles says. Not only are they under-represented, but they are also denied the chance to review major film releases, the report released on Friday has found. White male critics outnumber female critics from under-represented racial and ethnic backgrounds by 31 to 1. Dr Stacy L Smith of the USC Annenberg Inclusion Initiative said the findings made for ""depressing"" reading. Speaking at the Toronto Film Festival, Dr Smith saidthe data, drawn from reviews aggregator site Rotten Tomatoes,external, pointed to an ""invisibility"" and ""erasure"" of under-represented female critics. Analysis of more than 59,000 film reviews written by around 2,400 critics found stark disparities in gender and race, she told an audience on Friday. She said it had showed that male critics had written 78.7% of the reviews assessed, while women had written 21.3% of them. The disparity between white critics and critics from under-represented racial and ethnic backgrounds was even starker - an 83.2% to 16.8% split. Brie Larson calls for more diversity among film critics How Hollywood fails women on screen Director 'shocked' by lack of women in film Dr Smith went on to say that films with female leads from ethnic backgrounds were generally rated lower by white male reviewers, potentially affecting their box office performance. She called for target inclusion goals to be set and for major newspapers, trade publications and entertainment magazines to recruit more widely. The report, entitled Critic's Choice II, is the second in a series looking at representation in the film criticism sphere. Its findings are based on reviews of the 300 top-grossing films from 2015 to 2017 posted on the Rotten Tomatoes site.

"The family was not seriously hurt but was taken to hospital for checks A mother and child who accidentally fell on to a Tube track moments before a train arrived escaped unhurt by moving into a pit under the track. Police said the woman was pushing a buggy along a platform at Baker Street station in London on Friday night as she checked the arrivals board. Distracted, she veered too close to the edge and fell down. The father jumped down to help and the three of them moved into a pit beneath the track as a train passed over them. None of them was seriously hurt, but they were taken to hospital for checks, British Transport Police (BTP) said. The incident happened on the Jubilee Line, on the southbound strip of platform seven, TfL said. BTP said an investigation was ""continuing"" into the exact circumstances of what happened. Peter Holland said he saw people screaming and running in tears following the incident. ""We got to the platforms at Baker Street just as this happened, the train whistling, people screaming and running in tears"", he said. ""I can't tell you how relieved I am to hear this wasn't fatal. Thoughts out to the driver of the train. Unbelievable."" A woman who was at Baker Street described how the platform was quickly evacuated. ""I was on the platform for about two minutes and then an alarm went off which said 'this is an emergency. Everyone leave the station',"" she said. ""I left the station and within five minutes there were fire engines, police cars, St John's Ambulance, British Transport Police and undercover police cars. ""I saw a man leave the station with a child, then a woman came out and she was wearing white trainers which had black skid marks on, and then someone brought a buggy out of the station, but it didn't look damaged.""

Her fellow WEP co-founder Catherine Mayertweeted,externalthat there was a ""huge gasp"" in the party conference room as Toksvig responded to a question on pay. Toksvig, 60, took over from Fry in October 2016, who had hosted since 2003. She has filmed three series. Producers Fremantle Media have made no comment on the difference.

Answering a question about pay at the party conference, she said she had never wanted the equal pay argument to focus on her, she had a ""nice living"" and did ""very well"". But she added: ""I have recently discovered I get 40% of what Stephen used to get. And I get the same pay as (permanent panellist) Alan Davies, who is not the host. ""I temper this with the fact that I love the show and I'm the first woman to host such a show."" Later, she added: ""I love QI and the brilliant team who produce it. John Lloyd and the (production) team champion women on the show."" The Women's Equality Party (WEP) which she established with Ms Mayer campaigns for women to have the same rights and opportunities as men. Toksvig said she made the comments at the party's conference in answer to a question she felt she had to respond to ""because the issues with equal pay and the gender pay gap cut right across the media and all industries and all areas of life"". ""Until now I had held back from talking about this because this is not about me. ""However, the lack of transparency around pay is a big part of the problem and I hope that being open, I can support women across the country whose work is undervalued."" Toksvig also co-presents the Great British Bake Off. The amount she is paid for either roles has not been released.

"Outgoing Bookends owner Paul Morris and its new one Ceisjan Van Heerden As far as raffle prizes go, they do not come much bigger, or as surreal, as the one offered by Paul Morris. The 57-year-old book store owner gave customers the chance to win his shop Bookends in west Wales along with its contents if they spent more than Â£20. Mr Morris, who is taking early retirement, said he wanted to give it to someone who may not usually have the chance to run their own business. The winning ticket was picked by sci-fi fan and Dutchman Ceisjan Van Heerden. He will be giving up his job in customer service to relocate to Cardigan in Ceredigion, on the west Wales coast. ""I was so shocked when I heard I had won,"" said Mr Van Heerden. ""It's surreal. I had a coffee and a sit down to take it all in."" Bookends is based on High Street in Cardigan Father-of-two Mr Morris set up Bookends in 2014 after decades working in the publishing industry. ""I'd always thought Cardigan needed a book store and one night I was on eBay when I saw 18,000 books for sale - and it went from there."" Two lorry trips later - and six days of shelf stacking - the shop was up and running and has hosted in-store appearances by poets and authors. However, with Mr Morris' osteoarthritis worsening over the years he reluctantly decided to call it a day - but wanted to sell it with a difference. For three months, people who spent more than Â£20 were entered into a raffle. ""I didn't want to sell the shop and then see a chain take it over - I wanted it to stay a bookshop but give someone different a go,"" he said. ""I figured a raffle would be good, because no-one loses. Even if they did not get the shop, they still have some great books to read.""

"This video can not be played Chuka Umunna tells Labour's leader to ""call off the dogs"" Labour MP Chuka Umunna has accused leader Jeremy Corbyn of driving centre-left MPs like himself out of the party. The MP - a leading member of the cross-party People's Vote for a second EU referendum - urged Mr Corbyn to ""call off the dogs"". In a speech, the MP said so-called moderates face a ""clear and present danger"" of being run out of the party by hardline factions. A Labour Party source called the speech ""incoherent and inaccurate"". Why Corbyn allies want MP selection change Blair doubts Labour can be 'taken back' Some of Mr Corbyn's critics have faced battles with their local parties. Three of them lost no-confidence votes by local party members in their constituencies this week. Chris Leslie, MP for Nottingham East, accused the party leadership machine of orchestrating the move after losing a vote on Wednesday. Fellow MPs Joan Ryan, for Enfield North, and Luton South's Gavin Shuker also dismissed the votes, which carry no official force in the party. They said they would carry on as usual, with Ms Ryan blaming ""Trots, Stalinists, Communists and assorted hard-left"" for the 94-92 vote defeat. This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn emphasises his party's aspirations following criticism by former PM Tony Blair It comes as Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell prepares to begin a speaking tour of the UK in a bid to draw a line under bitter infighting in the party and push the agenda onto Conservative spending cuts, the Guardian reports. He is expected to launch the ""road to rebuilding the economy tour"" later in Broxtowe, the Nottinghamshire constituency of Conservative MP Anna Soubry, the paper says. Earlier this week, former Prime Minister Tony Blair said he was""not sure it is possible"" for Labour ""moderates"" to take the party back from Mr Corbyn and the left- and hinted at the creation of a new ""centre ground"" party. Meanwhile, Aberconwy Conservative MP Guto Bebb - a former minister -has joined the callsfor another referendum, saying the public should ""decide if they are happy"" with the prime minister's deal. Mr Umunna has written to members of his local Labour Party in Streatham, south London, to deny reports that he is involved in talks about a new party,the New Statesman reports,external. In a speech to the Blairite campaign group Progress, the former frontbencher said MPs were being targeted for standing up for zero tolerance of racism. He said: ""My message to our leadership: it is within your power to stop this, so call off the dogs and get on with what my constituency, one of the most diverse communities in the nation, demands we do - without equivocation, fight this Tory Brexit. ""That is where all our efforts should be."" Mr Umunna told the BAME Voices for Progress conference that the Brexit debate has normalised hatred and that black and minority ethnic voters have ""paid the price"". He warned the Labour leadership it would be a ""complete betrayal"" of the party's values to ""act as a bystander and wave through this disastrous Brexit"" and called for it to back a referendum on the final deal. A Labour Party source criticised Mr Umunna's speech. They told the BBC: ""This is incoherent and inaccurate, and does a disservice to his constituents who want Labour to oppose the Tories' brutal cuts to the services our communities rely on."" Joan Ryan, MP for Enfield North, lost a no-confidence vote in her constituency earlier this week Other Labour MPs who have lost local confidence votes includeFrank Field, who quit the parliamentary partylast week - citing the handling of the anti-Semitism row and bullying in local constituency parties - andKate Hoey.

"Actress Brie Larson has said the industry must do more ""to make sure everyone's in the room"" Women of colour are being ""written off"" as film critics, a study into film reviewers' demographic profiles says. Not only are they under-represented, but they are also denied the chance to review major film releases, the report released on Friday has found. White male critics outnumber female critics from under-represented racial and ethnic backgrounds by 31 to 1. Dr Stacy L Smith of the USC Annenberg Inclusion Initiative said the findings made for ""depressing"" reading. Speaking at the Toronto Film Festival, Dr Smith saidthe data, drawn from reviews aggregator site Rotten Tomatoes,external, pointed to an ""invisibility"" and ""erasure"" of under-represented female critics. Analysis of more than 59,000 film reviews written by around 2,400 critics found stark disparities in gender and race, she told an audience on Friday. She said it had showed that male critics had written 78.7% of the reviews assessed, while women had written 21.3% of them. The disparity between white critics and critics from under-represented racial and ethnic backgrounds was even starker - an 83.2% to 16.8% split. Brie Larson calls for more diversity among film critics How Hollywood fails women on screen Director 'shocked' by lack of women in film Dr Smith went on to say that films with female leads from ethnic backgrounds were generally rated lower by white male reviewers, potentially affecting their box office performance. She called for target inclusion goals to be set and for major newspapers, trade publications and entertainment magazines to recruit more widely. The report, entitled Critic's Choice II, is the second in a series looking at representation in the film criticism sphere. Its findings are based on reviews of the 300 top-grossing films from 2015 to 2017 posted on the Rotten Tomatoes site. Toronto Film Festival: Nine rising stars to watch Oscar-winning actress Brie Larson spoke out in June to salute Dr Smith and her team for their ""incredible"" work. ""We need to be conscious of our bias and do our part to make sure that everyone is in the room,"" she said at a Los Angeles awards ceremony.

"Hundreds were killed as security forces dispersed a sit-in at Rabaa al-Adawiya square in 2013 Egypt has delivered verdicts for more than 700 people over a pro-Muslim Brotherhood sit-in after President Mohammed Morsi was ousted in 2013. The court confirmed 75 people's death sentences and life imprisonment for 47 others, including Islamic leaders. Rights group Amnesty International has called the trial ""grossly unfair"" and a violation of Egypt's constitution. Violence erupted at the 2013 protest in Cairo's Rabaa al-Adawiya square, with hundreds killed by security forces. Earlier this year,Egypt's parliament gave military officers immunity for the deadly crackdownand any crimes committed between July 2013 and January 2016. Those who were sentenced in the mass trial were accused of security-related offences including incitement to violence, murder and organising illegal protests. Egypt timeline: Pro-Morsi unrest What's become of Egypt's Morsi? Egypt profile The 75 death sentences were handed down in Julyand Saturday's confirmation of them and the additional verdicts mark the end of the mass trial. Prominent members and politicians in the now-banned Muslim Brotherhood organisation were among those sentenced to life, including its Supreme Guide, Mohammed Badie. Also indicted was award-winning photo-journalist Mahmoud Abu Zeid, better known as Shawkan, who received a five-year prison sentence. Egyptian photojournalist Mahmoud Abu Zeid, seen in court Saturday, is expected to now walk free He was detained while taking pictures of the dispersal of the demonstration. He is expected to now walk free after having spent five years in jail pending trial. Hundreds of people were arrested when the Egyptian army and police dispersed the pro-Morsi protest, which took place a month after the democratically-elected former president was ousted by the then military chief and current president, Abdel Fatah al-Sisi. Rights groups have criticised the mass trial, andHuman Rights Watch has said the Egyptian security forces' killing of at least 817 people probably amounted to a crime against humanity. The government said many protesters were armed, and that eight police were killed - although it initially said more than 40 members of the security services had died. It has since declared the Muslim Brotherhood a ""terrorist organisation"".

"This video can not be played Miller (pictured) was due to go on tour next month. His friend, rapper Pittsburgh Slim, was among those paying tribute US rapper Mac Miller has been found dead at his California home, a Los Angeles coroner has confirmed. Media reports say the 26-year-old, who was open about his substance abuse, died from an apparent overdose. The rapper, whose real name was Malcolm James McCormick, rose to fame after topping US charts with his debut album in 2011. He released his latest record, Swimming, earlier this year and was due to go on tour. ""The music artist known as Mac Miller died today in his Studio City home,"" the LA County Department of Medical Examiner-Coroner said in a statement. ""In the late morning of September 7, Malcolm McCormick was found unresponsive.... authorities were called and Miller was pronounced dead at the scene at 11:51 (18:51 GMT). ""At this time, an autopsy is pending and a cause of death has not been determined."" Miller went through a well-publicised break-up with singer and girlfriend Ariana Grande earlier this year. The pair, who met in 2012, collaborated on a number of songs and performed together at the One Love Manchester concert in 2017. Charges were filed against the rapper last month after he was arrested in May for driving under the influence and hit and run. Grande spoke out publicly about ending their ""toxic relationship""after fans blamed her for his arrest. Grande suspended comments on her Instagram account on Friday shortly after Miller's death ""I am not a babysitter or a mother and no woman should feel that they need to be,"" she said in a typed message posted on social media. Grande said she had ""tried to support his sobriety"" for years, and was praying that he ""figures it all out"". Born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, Miller began to focus on his music while still at school and released his first mixtape under the name EZ Mac at just 15. Maturing in the public eye, he starred in a MTV reality series in 2013 which followed him and a group of friends after he moved to Los Angeles to pursue his career. He released a series of albums and EPs across the last decade, collaborating with high-profile artists like Kendrick Lamar and Pharrell Williams. In his final tweets posted on Thursday, the rapper promoted the North American tour he was set to embark on next month. He was ""a bright light in this world for his family, friends and fans."" his family said, in a statement confirming his death. Artists including Snoop Dog, Wiz Khalifa and Shawn Mendes paid tribute to Miller after news of his death broke on Friday. In a moving tweet, Chance the Rapper said he was ""completely broken"" after hearing the news and described Miller as ""one of the sweetest guys I ever knew"". Allow Twitter content?

Analysis by BBC Music Reporter Mark Savage A lot of rappers don't make beats. A lot of beat-makers can't rap. Mac Miller could do it all, lending an uncommon intimacy to his best songs. He started piano lessons at the age of six, later picking up drums, bass and keyboards. By the age of 15, he'd released his first mixtape, But My Mackin' Ain't Easy, but it was his fourth release, 2010's KIDS - a playful, freewheeling collection of party tunes that won him a recording contract. Over the years, he shed his frivolous, frat-boy reputation, making increasingly mature, introspective records that dealt with his personal demons; as well as 2016's The Divine Feminine, a naive but affecting (and occasionally too-graphic) concept album about what he called ""the feminine energy of the planet,""  but which many took to be a tribute to his partner, Ariana Grande. The rapper had more than eight million followers on Twitter In music, and in his interviews, he was open about his addictions - which eventually prompted Grande to end their relationship, describing it as a ""toxic relationship"". But Miller refused to exploit their break-up on his latest album, Swimming. ""Everybody wants a headline / I don't got nothin' to say,"" he rapped on Programs, released in May, just weeks after their split was confirmed. Instead, the album documented his ongoing struggles with substance abuse. ""Got my head underwater, but I ain't in the shower, and I ain't getting baptised,"" he confessed on Jet Fuel. The halting vocals and fractured, subdued production made it clear he was suffering but there was always a sense of optimism - a promise that those demons could be beaten. Tragically, it appears he lost the battle. Follow us onFacebook,external, on Twitter@BBCNewsEnts,external, or on Instagram atbbcnewsents,external.

Three boys from Runcorn, aged 15, 16, and 17, have been arrested on suspicion of murder, Cheshire Police said. Officers have appealed for information and said the attack was believed to be an ""isolated"" incident.

"Leah Cambridge had three heart attacks while under anaesthetic at a clinic in Turkey A mother of three died during ""Brazilian butt lift"" surgery in Turkey when a fat clot blocked one of her arteries, an inquest has found. Why is this procedure increasingly popular and is it more dangerous to have the operation abroad? Leah Cambridge, from Leeds, suffered a massive pulmonary embolism during the operation at a private hospital in Izmir in 2018,a coroner found. The 29-year-old beautician was undergoing a Brazilian Butt Lift (BBL) where fat from the stomach is injected into the buttocks. Ms Cambridge had opted for surgery abroad - which is often cheaper than in the UK - after growing paranoid about excess stomach fat after having children, her partner Mr Franks said. Celebrities such as reality TV star Kim Kardashian are seen as being central to a trend that celebrates women who have a slim waist and a round bottom Her neighbours have described her as ""absolutely stunning"", adding that they believed she had gone to have the treatment against her partner's wishes. And Ms Cambridge is not the first British woman whose quest for the perfect behind ended in tragedy abroad. Joy Williams underwentbuttock augmentation surgery in Bangkok, Thailand, in October 2014. Her wounds became infected, and the 24-year-old, from London, died under anaesthetic. Three years previously, 20-year-old Claudia Aderotimi, from Hackney, east London, died as a result of abotched ""buttock enhancement"" procedure at a US hotel. The BBL procedure is not considered to be any more dangerous than many other types of cosmetic surgery, according to consultant plastic surgeon Bryan Mayou. Scott Franks said he had been left a ""broken man"" after the death of his partner and warned others to think about the risks of cosmetic surgery ""The danger is the surgery being performed by unqualified surgeons outside a clinical setting without appropriate aftercare,"" says Mr Mayou, a member of the British Association of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons. ""If fat is injected deep into muscle tissue and lower down on the buttocks, there is a risk of incorrectly injecting fat into large veins. ""The fat, now an embolus, can pass around the bloodstream, into the lungs and cause death."" Claudia Aderotimi died after an injected substance spread to her organs Mr Franks, 31, told The Sun: ""Leah was under anaesthetic and complications happened due to fat getting deposited in her bloodstream and her oxygen levels fell. ""She was brought back to stable but had three heart attacks and there was nothing they could do."" Plastic surgeons from international societies have set up a taskforce to monitor and report on the BBL procedure, says Mr Mayou. The death rate following the procedure was found to be1 in 3,000,externaland all the fatal cases investigated featured fat emboli being found in the buttock muscle, he says. Keeping Up with the Kardashians star Kylie Jenner has denied having buttock implants The surgeon says he has noticed a rise in the number of bottom-boosting operations at his Cadogan Clinic in Chelsea, west London, in the past four years. ""It's a current fad,"" he explains. ""Years ago everyone wanted to be smaller and they would be saying 'can we have liposuction to make [my bottom] smaller?'"" And that is the technique that would be used if the ""bubble butt"" goes out of fashion and BBL patients want the procedure reversed, he says. Kylie Jenner and the celeb surgery effect Should Love Island surgery ads be banned? Social media linked to cosmetic boom So why the obsession with having a bigger behind? For Mr Mayou, it's down to popular culture celebrating curvier physiques. ""We live in an ethnically diverse world and there is an appreciation of different body shapes from our own, and then these techniques become available that make these shapes achievable."" Celebrities like Kim Kardashian, Kylie Jenner and Cardi B have huge followings on social media where they regularly post photographs flaunting their rounded posteriors. The rapper Cardi B has been open about having filler injected into her bottom Jenner posted a video,externalon her blog in which she attributed her curves to weight gain: ""[I haven't had] ass implants. You know, I used to be 120 [lbs]. I was really skinny. Now I'm pushing like 136. But it's alright, I like the chunkiness."" However, Cardi B has revealed that before she broke on to the music scene she had filler injected into her buttocks in a basement in New York - and the silicone leaked for five days afterwards. In an interview with GQ,she said she paid $800 (Â£564) for the procedure after seeing her stripper colleagues with bigger bottoms earning more than her. Chloe Simms, a star of reality soap The Only Way Is Essex, has been open about the bum-boosting cosmetic surgery she's had, having complained on the show that she had""the flattest bum in Essex"",external.

And as Mr Mayou points out, BBL surgery can be a particularly attractive idea for some women as it's seen as being able to solve two body hang-ups in one go. ""For a lot of people you are really getting two benefits from one operation - removing fat from somewhere they don't want it and putting it somewhere they do,"" he says. In terms of cost, cosmetic surgery is cheaper in countries like Turkey than in the UK, Mr Mayou says. The procedure is used to make buttocks bigger, more rounded or lifted Surgeons may insert silicone-filled implants and/or inject fat transferred from other parts of the body In the UK it tends to cost between Â£2,000 and Â£7,000, depending on the clinic and whether additional work is needed After surgery, patients are likely to have some pain, bruising and discomfort over the area of the implant for a few weeks and are advised not to sit on their buttocks directly for three weeks Complications can include wound infection, rupture of prosthetic implants and fat embolus, where fat can enter the bloodstream and block vessels He estimates a BBL procedure would cost about Â£8,000 in the UK. Some reports state Ms Cambridge paid as little as Â£3,000 for her surgery. ""But we have people travelling from abroad to our clinics in London because our surgeons are qualified, regulated - our clinics are safe - so it's a two-way thing,"" he says. ""I think people are being enticed by heavy marketing; it's all in a foreign language and they have no way of checking if the surgeons are safe,"" Mr Mayou adds. ""It's a commercial enterprise and they are not going to turn down people. They will do everyone whether they are suitable for the operation or not. ""By making the decision to undergo cut-price surgery, patients risk serious complications and even - as this tragic story illustrates - death.""

"A mother who was forced to stand while breastfeeding on a crowded train, has urged people to show ""common courtesy"". But often it's not selfishness that stops us from making a kind gesture, it's a fear of the consequences. We've all been on a crowded bus, a rush-hour train or Tube carriage with people packed like sardines - when someone gets on and looks around for a seat. Maybe you haven't noticed them  - headphones clamped to your ears, attention gripped by a podcast. Or perhaps your eyes are fixed to your phone, your head absorbed in a mind-numbing game. Maybe you haven't noticed. Or just maybe, you've pretended not to notice.  That, says mother Kate Hitchens, was the reasonshe was forced to stand on a busy train while breastfeeding her baby. There are plenty of other examples of people needing seats and passengers refusing to move. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Selfishness and inattention play a part, says Dr Oliver Scott Curry, an expert in human behaviour, based at the University of Oxford. But, in some cases so does buck-passing. ""Everyone can be waiting for someone else to do it, thinking 'why should it be me? I'm exhausted'. ""They're just passing the buck."" Almost everyone has heard of someone graciously offering a seat to a ""pregnant"" woman, only to be rebuked for their insensitivity. The woman in question had actually just enjoyed a big lunch and would be perfectly fine standing, thanks very much. ""There's a fear of getting it wrong, of seeming patronising or thinking someone is a charity case. It doesn't hurt for the person needing help to ask for it."" And yet, just when it seems like humanity is doomed by self-interest, Dr Curry has observed a encouraging flipside - ""competitive helping"". This, he says, is where passengers almost fall over themselves to give up their seat to prove they're the most chivalrous. Mary Killen says society is ""increasingly selfish"" Gogglebox star and social etiquette expert Mary Killen can remember a time when it was ""the custom that men always made their seat available to women and older people"". ""But now I think they've been frightened by feminists biting their heads off."" Ms Killen, who writes an advice column for The Spectator magazine, says denial among seated passengers is not a reasonable excuse. ""It's usually clear when someone needs a seat as they are either looking for [one] or trying to make eye contact. People should offer."" Campaigner urges commuters to offer their seats Are badges for hidden conditions working? What about the risk of social stigma at offering your hard-earned pew to someone who isn't in need. ""It's worth getting your head snapped off, because these little acts of recognition of other humans are of such value."" Of Kate Hitchens' experience, Ms Killen says simply that ""someone should have given this lady a seat. It's extraordinary no one did, unless they were all zombified by their mobiles"". ""I also think we're becoming increasingly selfish as a society."" Rebecca Willcox says some people look at her and decide she doesn't need a seat Rebecca Willcox, who has secondary breast cancer, has written about her experience of interacting with strangers who cannot see she's unwell. ""From your perspective, riding a few stops without a seat isn't a great inconvenience, but for me it can mean a period of constant bangs and painful jolts to my back,"" she wrote inan article for Breast Cancer Care,external. Speaking to BBC News, Mrs Willcox says she always asks for a seat as she doesn't expect people to look around and notice her badge announcing she needs to sit down. ""Only once has someone leapt up without me asking."" But when she has asked, ""every single time, someone has offered me a seat"" although she has detected ""grumbles."" Mrs Willcox says one woman didn't think there was anything wrong with her while a man seated on a busy platform gawped at her stomach, to see if she was pregnant, before giving up his privileged place. ""I've also had an entire carriage stand up, and it's almost embarrassing to have to choose who to turf out. ""Another time, someone at the opposite end stood up - other people had clearly looked at me and thought 'no'. I then had the awkward situation of having to shuffle past them. ""Looking at me, you wouldn't know there was anything wrong. But I'm on aggressive chemotherapy and need to sit down as I'm nauseous most of the time. ""It makes me a bit sad that people have looked at me and decided for themselves I don't need a seat. I almost want to tell them: 'You have no idea how difficult it is, living with cancer and chemotherapy side effects'."" Adam Partridge from etiquette experts Debrett's offers the following advice: ""If you see someone that looks as if they are uncomfortable and would appreciate a seat, then it is good manners to offer yours."" It is better to ask and be rejected than not ask at all, he advises, and that ""there's a responsibility on both sides to refrain from taking offence"". More than a million baby on board badges have been requested So what can transport companies do? Dr Curry says he wants others to follow the example of Transport for London, which initiated the ""baby on board"" badge scheme. It's also now launched a badge for those with other, less obvious, reasons they need to take the weight off their feet. The ""Please offer me a seat"" badge has been issued 81,000 times, with the scheme adopted by Greater Anglia Trains and the New York Transit Authority. And over the summer it also backedthe Look Up campaign started by Corry Shaw, who uses the Please Offer Me a Seat badge, but found often people just avoided eye contact, or didn't notice her at all. Ms Shaw, who has a spine disorder, said it ""makes her sad"" that some people are embarrassed or scared of causing offence. ""If you are unsure about offering in case you cause offence you don't need to verbally offer,"" she wrote, ""just stand and if the person needs the seat believe me they will jump right in it (or sort of wobble into it if it's me).""

"Nikolai Glushkov was found murdered in his London home in March of this year A Russian who was murdered in the UK last March believed two men from Moscow had tried to poison him five years earlier. Nikolai Glushkov was found apparently strangled in his home in south-west London a week after the Novichok poisoning of the Skripals in Salisbury. The Guardian has now revealed he was allegedly poisoned in 2013,externalafter he shared champagne with two Russians. The paper says the police are reinvestigating the incident. Mr Glushkov - a prominent Russian businessman and former deputy director of state airline Aeroflot - was jailed for five years in his home country in 1999 after being charged with money laundering and fraud. After being given a suspended sentence for another count of fraud in 2006, he was granted political asylum in the UK in 2010 and became a critic of Russian President Vladimir Putin. Counter-terror police investigate death Murder inquiry over Russian's London death Who was Nikolai Glushkov? Paramedic Keith Carr told the BBC that he treated Mr Glushkov in November 2013 for suspected poisoning after the businessman had shared drinks with two men from Moscow in Bristol's Grand Hotel. This video can not be played Paramedic Keith Carr says Nikolai Glushkov believed two men tried to poison him in 2013 Mr Carr, who was working for the South Western Ambulance Service, said he responded to a report that Mr Glushkov had collapsed on the floor of his room the morning after the drinks. He said he found Mr Glushkov with carpet burns. Two police officers were also present, he added. Mr Glushkov told him he believed he had been poisoned by the two Russians with champagne the night before. Mr Carr told the BBC: ""Apparently the champagne was bought in the hotel. They all drank the champagne but he left their company and went to the toilet, came back, drank some more and the next thing he remembers was waking up on the carpet the next morning."" Mr Carr said he was initially ""sceptical"" of the claims but when he tested Mr Glushkov with an electrocardiogram machine he had a fast heart rate and an unusual rhythm which he couldn't recognise. He said Mr Glushkov was then taken to the Bristol Royal Infirmary, where a consultant later told Mr Carr the case was being taken ""very seriously"". Mr Glushkov told Mr Carr that he believed he had been targeted because of his close friendship with fellow Russian businessman Boris Berezovsky, who came to the UK in 1999 after falling out with Mr Putin. Mr Berezovsky was found hanged in the bathroom of his Berkshire home in 2013, six months before the incident with Mr Glushkov. Mr Carr said looking back he ""believed totally"" Mr Glushkov's account. Avon and Somerset Police confirmed the incident was investigated at the time and no charges were brought. Counter-terrorism police led the murder inquiry after Mr Glushkov was found dead in south-west London in March this year. The Guardian reported that the officers are now reinvestigating the 2013 Bristol incident as part of their inquiry. A Scotland Yard spokesman said the Bristol incident was a matter for Avon and Somerset Police, and added: ""We are not prepared to discuss specific lines of inquiry in regards to our investigation."" The news comes days after Scotland Yard and the Crown Prosecution Service namedtwo Russian nationals as suspects in the attempted murder of former Russian spy Sergei Skripaland his daughter Yulia. Prime Minister Theresa May said the men, using the names Alexander Petrov and Ruslan Boshirov, are thought to be officers from Russia's military intelligence service. This video can not be played Police are appealing for information on Alexander Petrov (left) and Ruslan Boshirov Mr Skripal, 66, and his daughter Yulia, 33, were poisoned with the nerve agent Novichok in March. Det Sgt Nick Bailey also fell ill after responding to the incident in Salisbury. Police are linking the attack to a separate Novichok poisoning on 30 June, when Dawn Sturgess and Charlie Rowley became unwell at a house in Amesbury, about eight miles from Salisbury. Ms Sturgess died in hospital on 8 July. Mr Rowley was discharged from hospital on 20 July.

"People being harassed by cold calls about PPI compensation or personal injury claims could gain some respite under new rules being introduced by the government. The new measures mean companies will only be allowed to contact people who have opted-in to receive the calls. Claims management companies that break the rules can be fined up to Â£500,000. Minister for Digital Margot James said: ""Today we are one step closer to ending the menace of nuisance calls."" ""This is probably the single biggest move we've made against these companies,"" she added. ""Our new laws mean people will now have to give consent to receive calls and have the power to choose where they seek compensation for personal injury claims or mis-sold payment protection insurance."" Previously consumers had to ""opt-out"" of receiving the calls by registering with the free Telephone Preference Service or by withdrawing their consent while actually on the call. However, the new powers will force the company making the phone call to check to make sure they have the recipient's consent before calling. Anyone receiving an unwelcome and unexpected call from a claims company should take note of the number and inform the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO), which has the power to fine firms that breach the rules. Despite a series of measures designed to crackdown on nuisance calls, they keep on coming. The Financial Conduct Authority said that in the past 12 months, about 2.7 billion unsolicited calls, texts and emails were made offering to help people make a claim. That works out at 50 calls, texts or emails being made to every member of the adult population in the past year. James Dipple-Johnstone, deputy commissioner of operations at the ICO, said the move was a ""step in the right direction"" and would make it easier to carry out ""enforcement action"". He said his office received ""many thousands"" of complaints each year. Last year, it issued 26 fines to some of the worst-offending organisations, generating more than Â£3m, he said. Asked why so few fines were issued, he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that the ICO was also advising, guiding and serving enforcement notices to companies behind the scenes. The new measures will apply to phone calls only - not texts or emails. Ms James told the BBC: ""The people who bear the brunt of these calls are older people and vulnerable groups. ""While the calls may be a source of annoyance to many people, for older people they can be a deep source of worry and anxiety."" She said the government has given money to Trading Standards to help them install call-blocking devices in the phones of older people. ""But I would urge any family members or older people themselves if they are online to report any breaches to the Information Commissioner's Office."" she said. Victims of annoying cold calls from claims managers can report a breach of the new laws atthe ICO's website,external. Ask cold callers to remove your information from their records Find out caller's number from a landline by dialling 1471 after the call Check with your phone company if you can be made ex-directory Give away personal or financial information, even if callers claim to be from a company you know Lose your temper.

"'The podcast is useful for people going through other kinds of trauma,' Alison Carter said Following the death of BBC Radio 5 Live presenterRachael Blandat the age of 40, a swell of support and condolence messages have been posted on social media. Her podcast,You, Me and the Big C, which she co-presented with Deborah James and Lauren Mahon, was, and still is, hugely popular. The day before she died, her husband, Steve,tweeted,externalthat they had reached the top of the podcast chart. Alison Carter, a retail manager in London, was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2017 and has written a blog about her own cancer journey. She said she looked forward to every podcast and felt she could relate to so much of what Rachael had said. ""It felt like my generation was talking to me and that's been really powerful,"" she said. Alison Carter says cancer is one of the most challenging things people will face ""So much of the discussions about cancer is around old people. There are a lot of us in our 30s, 40s, 50s who have cancer. ""Rachael clearly had a positive attitude to life which enabled her to talk about the tough stuff too - the impact of 'chemo brain', on body image and on relationships."" Alison said she also took comfort from the frank discussions about the challenges of dealing with family and friends after diagnosis. ""They're not in a place to offer the support that they would like to give,"" she said. ""Cancer can be hugely isolating. Your body goes to a place you've not been through and your support network don't know what you're going through. The podcast was refreshing."" Although she finds it painful to think about it now, Alison found the podcast about death ""the most honest piece of broadcasting I've ever heard"". ""The more we talk about it, the less scary it is,"" she said. ""I get a great sense of comfort from the podcast. ""If you try and joke about cancer, those who haven't got it are shocked. But the podcast was funny, powerful and really helpful."" Roderick is looking forward to listening to the next podcast Roderick Bailey, from Hastings, who was diagnosed with prostate cancer in March 2017, said he had taken great strength from Rachael, Lauren and Deborah's openness but had been staggered at how upset he had been to hear of Rachael's death. ""It felt like somebody really close to me had died. How must her husband, Steve, be feeling?"" he said. He has found the podcast helpful as he prepares for surgery - a prostatectomy - on Monday. ""The tears and laughter have really resonated with me. Rachael's story of one disappointment after another is like mine,"" he said. ""I worked for Cancer Research UK for 23 years. I never thought I'd personally be facing cancer."" Roderick said the rest of his family could not listen to the podcast and felt he was ""too wrapped up in cancer"". ""Everyone is fed up of me talking about it but when it's happening to you, you can't turn yourself off,"" he said. ""I really admire their network of support and the honesty of their chats. I'm looking forward to listening to the next one, which could be from hospital."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"Nikolai Glushkov was found murdered in his London home in March of this year A Russian who was murdered in the UK last March believed two men from Moscow had tried to poison him five years earlier. Nikolai Glushkov was found apparently strangled in his home in south-west London a week after the Novichok poisoning of the Skripals in Salisbury. The Guardian has now revealed he was allegedly poisoned in 2013,externalafter he shared champagne with two Russians. The paper says the police are reinvestigating the incident. Mr Glushkov - a prominent Russian businessman and former deputy director of state airline Aeroflot - was jailed for five years in his home country in 1999 after being charged with money laundering and fraud. After being given a suspended sentence for another count of fraud in 2006, he was granted political asylum in the UK in 2010 and became a critic of Russian President Vladimir Putin. Counter-terror police investigate death Murder inquiry over Russian's London death Who was Nikolai Glushkov? Paramedic Keith Carr told the BBC that he treated Mr Glushkov in November 2013 for suspected poisoning after the businessman had shared drinks with two men from Moscow in Bristol's Grand Hotel. This video can not be played Paramedic Keith Carr says Nikolai Glushkov believed two men tried to poison him in 2013 Mr Carr, who was working for the South Western Ambulance Service, said he responded to a report that Mr Glushkov had collapsed on the floor of his room the morning after the drinks. He said he found Mr Glushkov with carpet burns. Two police officers were also present, he added. Mr Glushkov told him he believed he had been poisoned by the two Russians with champagne the night before. Mr Carr told the BBC: ""Apparently the champagne was bought in the hotel. They all drank the champagne but he left their company and went to the toilet, came back, drank some more and the next thing he remembers was waking up on the carpet the next morning."" Mr Carr said he was initially ""sceptical"" of the claims but when he tested Mr Glushkov with an electrocardiogram machine he had a fast heart rate and an unusual rhythm which he couldn't recognise. He said Mr Glushkov was then taken to the Bristol Royal Infirmary, where a consultant later told Mr Carr the case was being taken ""very seriously"". Mr Glushkov told Mr Carr that he believed he had been targeted because of his close friendship with fellow Russian businessman Boris Berezovsky, who came to the UK in 1999 after falling out with Mr Putin. Mr Berezovsky was found hanged in the bathroom of his Berkshire home in 2013, six months before the incident with Mr Glushkov. Mr Carr said looking back he ""believed totally"" Mr Glushkov's account. Avon and Somerset Police confirmed the incident was investigated at the time and no charges were brought. Counter-terrorism police led the murder inquiry after Mr Glushkov was found dead in south-west London in March this year. The Guardian reported that the officers are now reinvestigating the 2013 Bristol incident as part of their inquiry. A Scotland Yard spokesman said the Bristol incident was a matter for Avon and Somerset Police, and added: ""We are not prepared to discuss specific lines of inquiry in regards to our investigation."" The news comes days after Scotland Yard and the Crown Prosecution Service namedtwo Russian nationals as suspects in the attempted murder of former Russian spy Sergei Skripaland his daughter Yulia. Prime Minister Theresa May said the men, using the names Alexander Petrov and Ruslan Boshirov, are thought to be officers from Russia's military intelligence service. This video can not be played Police are appealing for information on Alexander Petrov (left) and Ruslan Boshirov Mr Skripal, 66, and his daughter Yulia, 33, were poisoned with the nerve agent Novichok in March.

Police are linking the attack to a separate Novichok poisoning on 30 June, when Dawn Sturgess and Charlie Rowley became unwell at a house in Amesbury, about eight miles from Salisbury.

"About 1,340 general crime incidents were linked to England's games There was a ""significant rise"" in domestic abuse reports during the World Cup, the lead officer for football policing in England and Wales has said. More than 60 incidents were reported after England's semi-final defeat by Croatia, compared to the highest figure of 24 during Euro 2016. It is not clear if this is due to a rise in the crime or better reporting. Deputy Chief Constable Mark Roberts said forces dealt with ""record numbers"" of crime related to the tournament. About 1,340 of the total 1,487 football-linked reported incidents (90%) were in relation to England's seven games between 14 June and 15 July, the National Police Chiefs' Council (NPCC) said. If you have been affected by domestic abuse,help and support is available here. England were beaten by Croatia in the semi-final Nearly 700 reports of trouble at licensed premises and 239 domestic abuse calls were also linked to the team's fixtures. In contrast, only three out of 6,873 travelling England fans were arrested in Russia ""despite pre-tournament concerns and some bad behaviour at earlier England games, most notably in Amsterdam"", said DCC Roberts. ""While the picture in Russia was positive, at home in England it was completely the opposite with record numbers of incidents for the police to deal with, even when the team was performing well. ""The bulk of these were alcohol-fuelled and depressingly we saw significant rises in incidents of domestic abuse."" 'Idiots' put dampener on celebrations Fans foot England celebration repair bill Horse punch fan given community order Deputy Chief Constable Louisa Rolfe, the NPCC's lead on domestic violence said: ""Football does not cause domestic abuse but these figures suggest an increase in incidents during key England fixtures. ""Whilst emotions may run high, there is no excuse to abuse your partner."" Katie Ghose, chief executive of the Women's Aid charity, said it was ""the behaviour and actions of abusers who exert power and control over their victims that cause domestic abuse"". She repeated her calls for ""the football community to stand united against domestic abuse and sexism"", adding that its Football United Against Domestic Violence campaign had worked with clubs, the FA and the Premier League to ""call out the sexist attitudes and behaviour that some fans still exhibit"".

An ambulance car was jumped on in London, a taxi suffered a similar fate in Nottingham and an Ikea branch was targeted.

"An area in the town centre has been cordoned off by police A woman has been arrested after a man was stabbed in a town centre. Police received reports of someone in Barnsley town centre with a knife at about 08:20 BST. The man suffered minor injuries and a woman, 28, was arrested on suspicion of attempted murder.

Police said the woman remained in custody and was ""currently being assessed from a mental health perspective"". Earlier South Yorkshire Police had been receiving support from counter-terrorism officers. Market trader Abdul Razzaq, 43, said he confronted a woman after she produced ""a huge kitchen knife"" and shouted ""kill"" repeatedly as she stabbed one man in the shoulder and then walked around the busy streets. He said she had taken the knife out of its wrapping and put the packaging in a bin near his stall. Mr Razzaq described how he then followed the woman around the town centre as shoppers moved out of her way. He said he convinced her to put down the knife before police officers made the arrest. ""People were scared. They were really scared,"" he added. Abdul Razzaq said he confronted a woman after she produced ""a huge kitchen knife"" Earlier, police said there would be a ""high visibility police presence"" in the town centre and asked people to remain vigilant. No other injuries have been reported.

"About 1,340 general crime incidents were linked to England's games There was a ""significant rise"" in domestic abuse reports during the World Cup, the lead officer for football policing in England and Wales has said. More than 60 incidents were reported after England's semi-final defeat by Croatia, compared to the highest figure of 24 during Euro 2016. It is not clear if this is due to a rise in the crime or better reporting. Deputy Chief Constable Mark Roberts said forces dealt with ""record numbers"" of crime related to the tournament. About 1,340 of the total 1,487 football-linked reported incidents (90%) were in relation to England's seven games between 14 June and 15 July, the National Police Chiefs' Council (NPCC) said. If you have been affected by domestic abuse,help and support is available here. England were beaten by Croatia in the semi-final Nearly 700 reports of trouble at licensed premises and 239 domestic abuse calls were also linked to the team's fixtures. In contrast, only three out of 6,873 travelling England fans were arrested in Russia ""despite pre-tournament concerns and some bad behaviour at earlier England games, most notably in Amsterdam"", said DCC Roberts. ""While the picture in Russia was positive, at home in England it was completely the opposite with record numbers of incidents for the police to deal with, even when the team was performing well. ""The bulk of these were alcohol-fuelled and depressingly we saw significant rises in incidents of domestic abuse."" 'Idiots' put dampener on celebrations Fans foot England celebration repair bill Horse punch fan given community order Deputy Chief Constable Louisa Rolfe, the NPCC's lead on domestic violence said: ""Football does not cause domestic abuse but these figures suggest an increase in incidents during key England fixtures. ""Whilst emotions may run high, there is no excuse to abuse your partner."" Katie Ghose, chief executive of the Women's Aid charity, said it was ""the behaviour and actions of abusers who exert power and control over their victims that cause domestic abuse"". She repeated her calls for ""the football community to stand united against domestic abuse and sexism"", adding that its Football United Against Domestic Violence campaign had worked with clubs, the FA and the Premier League to ""call out the sexist attitudes and behaviour that some fans still exhibit"". World Cup 2018 England v Croatia semi-final64 England v Sweden quarter-final62 England v Colombia42 England v Panama29 England v Tunisia24 Euro 2016 England v Russia24 England v Wales21 According to the NPCC, the highest level of trouble was seen after England's 2-0 quarter-final win over Sweden, when 391 incidents were reported. Some fans were labelled ""mindless idiots""after vehicles and property were damaged across the country. An ambulance car was jumped on in London, a taxi suffered a similar fate in Nottingham and an Ikea branch was targeted. Some police forces said they received a record number of 999 calls in a 24-hour period. West Midlands Police tweeted it had been due to ""a mix of the sun, World Cup and alcohol,external"".

"An area in the town centre has been cordoned off by police A woman has been arrested after a man was stabbed in a town centre. Police received reports of someone in Barnsley town centre with a knife at about 08:20 BST. The man suffered minor injuries and a woman, 28, was arrested on suspicion of attempted murder. South Yorkshire Police has since recovered a knife. The force said an investigation was under way to establish whether it was ""an isolated incident and whether the individual acted alone"".

He said she had taken the knife out of its wrapping and put the packaging in a bin near his stall. Mr Razzaq described how he then followed the woman around the town centre as shoppers moved out of her way. He said he convinced her to put down the knife before police officers made the arrest.

"Protesters in the city of Idlib called for international help to stop the expected offensive Russian war planes have launched fresh strikes on the Syrian province of Idlib, a monitor says, as talks in Tehran failed to stop an impending military offensive there. The raids targeted rebel-held positions in Idlib's south-west, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said. Syrian forces, backed by Russia and Iran, are poised to attack the last major rebel stronghold in Syria. Turkey and others have warned of a pending humanitarian disaster. Five reasons why the battle for Idlib matters How Idlib may be changing Trump's Syria strategy Why is there a war in Syria? In the province itself, thousands of people staged street protests after Friday prayers calling for international protection. In footage circulating on social media, one protester in the town of Al-Dana said they were demanding that the UN ""stop the killing of Syrians"". The observatory said Russian jets hit positions of the jihadist alliance Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) and the Ahrar al-Sham group on Friday. ""The aim was to destroy rebel fortifications,"" observatory head Rami Abdel Rahman said. HTS is designated by the UN as a terrorist group and has an estimated 10,000 fighters in Idlib. This video can not be played The war in Syria could be about to enter its final stage Earlier in the week, Russian jets were reported to have carried out about 30 strikes on rebel-held areas in western Idlib, the mountains of Latakia province, and the Sahl al-Ghab plain. Syrian army soldiers and allied militiamen are reportedly massing for what has been described as a phased offensive. HTS and rival rebel factions backed by neighbouring Turkey have said they will fight back. At a trilateral meeting between Russia, Iran and Turkey on Friday, Russian President Vladimir Putin rejected Turkey's calls for a truce in Idlib. Mr Putin said Russia would continue its fight against ""terrorists"" in Idlib province. Turkey - which has long backed some rebel groups - fears an all-out assault will trigger another major refugee crisis on its southern border. President Recep Tayyip Erdogan told his Russian and Iranian counterparts: ""We don't want Idlib to turn into a bloodbath."" At the summit in Tehran, Russia and Iran said the fight against militants had to continue ""Any attack on Idlib would result in a catastrophe. Any fight against terrorists requires methods based on time and patience."" However, Russia and Iran say jihadist groups in Idlib must be wiped out. Iran's President Hassan Rouhani argued that ""fighting terrorism in Idlib was an unavoidable part of the mission to restore peace and stability to Syria"". Meanwhile, Mr Putin said ""the legitimate Syrian government has a right and must eventually take control of its entire national territory"". The province is the last major stronghold of the rebel and jihadist groups which have been trying to overthrow Mr Assad for the past seven years. Idlib straddles major highways across Syria and if it is retaken by the government, would leave the rebels with just a few isolated pockets of territory across the country. Who's in control of Idlib? The province is not controlled by a single group, but rather by a number of rival factions, including a jihadist alliance linked to al-Qaeda, and a rival National Liberation Front which is backed by Turkey. Up to 30,000 rebel and jihadist fighters are believed to be in Idlib. But the vast majority of its residents are civilians. The UN says the region is home to some 2.9 million people, including a million children. More than half of the civilians have already been displaced at least once from elsewhere in Syria and have nowhere left to go. The UN fears a large-scale offensive in Idlib will lead to a humanitarian disaster. Without a political solution in Syria, ""we will see this war reach new levels of horrors"", the UN special envoy on Syria, Staffan de Mistura, said. Thousands of people displaced by the civil war are sheltering in camps in Idlib On Thursday, the new US envoy for Syria, Jim Jeffrey, said the anticipated conflict would be a ""reckless escalation"", and that ""there is lots of evidence that chemical weapons are being prepared."" He did not give details of the evidence he was referring to. The Syrian government has denied ever using chemical weapons. However, experts from the UN and the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) have said government forces were behindan attack involving the nerve agent Sarin on a rebel-held town in southern Idlib in April 2017that killed more than 80 people. The US state department warned on Monday that Washington would respond to any new chemical attacks by the Syrian government or its allies. What will Trump do next on Syria?

"Honeybourne 3, a Scottish scallop dredger, was involved in the clashes in the English Channel in August The UK and France have failed to agree a deal to end a dispute over scallop fishing in the English Channel. Crews clashed in the waters last month over laws that allow British boats to gather scallops year-round, but places restrictions on French vessels. The two sides had agreed on the principles of a deal earlier this week, but were unable to finalise it during negotiations on Friday. A government spokeswoman said discussions were continuing. Further talks have been proposed for Tuesday, but the meeting has not yet been confirmed. French and UK boats clash in 'scallop war' Scallop wars: Could Brexit calm troubled waters? Reality Check: What are the rules on scallops? Tensions rose over scallop fishing in the Baie de Seine in August when 35 French boats confronted five British craft off the coast of northern France, with reports of stones and smoke bombs being hurled at UK fishing crews. A French local government spokesperson, Ingrid Parrot, said: ""Things were thrown on both sides."" The row stems from laws that allow British boats to legally forage in the area all year round, but French law bans their crews from the area between 15 May and 1 October to conserve stocks. There is an industry-wide agreement that British vessels larger than 15m are not allowed in the area, but smaller boats could still forage. This video can not be played French and British fishing fleets have come to blows over when they can catch scallops As a result, French crews have accused the British of depleting shellfish stocks. At a meeting in London this week, it was agreed that smaller UK vessels would not fish in the area during the period that French laws prevented their counterparts from doing the same. But British crews said they would only agree to this if they would not lose out financially and were compensated. A meeting in Paris on Friday saw the deal fall through. Mike Park, chief executive of the Scottish White Fish Producers Association, told the BBC that both sides tried hard to bridge the gap at the meeting but there was a ""significant way to go"". He said: ""There is a feeling of disappointment because we agreed the main terms of the deal in London earlier in the week and we thought we were going to Paris just to shake hands and that would be it. ""But from the very start, it became obvious that the French understanding of it was very different from ours."" Mike Park from the Scottish White Fish Producers Association said it was ""disappointing"" that no deal had been agreed He said they were hoping to reconvene on Tuesday to ""find a solution"". ""I think there is now a will at government level to try to resolve the issue, so I think we can make it work,"" he added. ""But the next round will be the telling round because if that doesn't provide a solution then I think we will have difficulty."" A statement from the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said the talks were ""making progress"". The spokeswoman added:  ""Discussions are continuing and we are looking at next steps."" Deal close after Channel scallop row Reality Check: What are the rules on scallops?

"The RMT strikes over guards have been running for two years Workers on two rail networks have begun a 24-hour strike over the future of guards on trains. Members of the RMT transport union stopped work at midnight on Northern Rail and South Western Railway (SWR). Northern said it would run 30% of its services, with ""very few trains"" before 09:00 BST and after 18:00. South Western said it would operate half of its normal service. Both companies said some routes would have no trains or replacement buses. The dispute has affected commuters and rail firms nationwide The RMT (the National Union of Rail, Maritime and Transport Workers) is asking for a guarantee of guards on trains and a halt to the ""rolling out of driver-only operation"". SWR said it would roster guards on all services but trains could still operate in ""exceptional circumstances"" if no guard was available. Northern said it was prepared to ""guarantee jobs for conductors"". What does a train guard do? Rail workers vote to continue strikes Major events hit by rail staff walkout The Northern strike is the third in a series of walkouts planned for six consecutive Saturdays until 29 September. A further strike on SWR is planned on 15 September. RMT said it had secured ""guard guarantees"" in Wales and Scotland as well as on a number of English franchises. The strike is part of a nationwide two-year dispute about the increase ofdriver-only-operated trains Driver-only-operated trains are where the driver, rather than the conductor, opens and closes the doors A third of Britain's services already have this in place and it has been in operation for about 30 years The rail safety regulator says it is safe - a position that has beensupported by the government,external Rail unions disagree - they say the on-board conductor or guard has a much better view of the doors and can stop people getting trapped The London tube network is driver-only operated Rail workers vote to continue strikes Rail strike to affect Britney concert SWR rail workers hold three-day strike Major events hit by rail staff walkout What does a train guard do?

"The family was not seriously hurt but was taken to hospital for checks A mother and child who accidentally fell on to a Tube track moments before a train arrived escaped unhurt by moving into a pit under the track. Police said the woman was pushing a buggy along a platform at Baker Street station in London on Friday night as she checked the arrivals board. Distracted, she veered too close to the edge and fell down. The father jumped down to help and the three of them moved into a pit beneath the track as a train passed over them. None of them was seriously hurt, but they were taken to hospital for checks, British Transport Police (BTP) said. The incident happened on the Jubilee Line, on the southbound strip of platform seven, TfL said. BTP said an investigation was ""continuing"" into the exact circumstances of what happened. Peter Holland said he saw people screaming and running in tears following the incident. ""We got to the platforms at Baker Street just as this happened, the train whistling, people screaming and running in tears"", he said. ""I can't tell you how relieved I am to hear this wasn't fatal. Thoughts out to the driver of the train. Unbelievable."" A woman who was at Baker Street described how the platform was quickly evacuated. ""I was on the platform for about two minutes and then an alarm went off which said 'this is an emergency. Everyone leave the station',"" she said. ""I left the station and within five minutes there were fire engines, police cars, St John's Ambulance, British Transport Police and undercover police cars. ""I saw a man leave the station with a child, then a woman came out and she was wearing white trainers which had black skid marks on, and then someone brought a buggy out of the station, but it didn't look damaged.""

"Laura Beattie, who has cystic fibrosis, is waiting for a lung transplant The number of people waiting for a lung transplant has gone up by 46% over the past five years, according to official figures. NHS Blood and Transplant (NHSBT) said the challenge of matching lungs of the right size and a rising number of ageing donors are possible factors. It called on people to talk about organ donation, because lung transplants are the only hope for those on the list. The overall waiting list for organs has come down over the same period. There are now 354 people waiting for a new lung in the UK, compared to 242 in 2012-13 - Laura Beattie from Greater Manchester is one of them. Laura, 29, from Stretford, has cystic fibrosis and was added to the transplant waiting list just over a month ago. Her lung function has declined over the last couple of years, and is now at around 24%. ""I've known for more than 20 years that I would need a transplant one day but I was still terrified to be told I was going on the list because it made it real,"" said Laura. ""But I know it's the right thing to do. I get breathless even turning over in bed or getting dressed."" Laura now uses oxygen every day and also a wheelchair when she goes out for more than a few hours. She also requires non-invasive ventilation overnight. Laura co-founded a business with her sister Rachel Despite this, she has co-founded a fashion business with her sister. She said: ""I could be waiting a short time or a long time, I don't know. I just try and get on with my life. ""I really hope more people support and really consider donation because a transplant is my only option now and donation can save so many lives."" Lungs and hearts are both delicate organs, which makes successful donation and transplantation more problematic, particularly when donors are mostly aged over 50 and are more likely to have existing health problems. The waiting list for hearts is the only organ-specific waiting list that has also risen. In contrast, there are currently 6,013 people on the overall waiting list for an organ - a 17% decline over the same period, from 7,335. NHSBT said the causes of the rise in the lung transplant waiting list were being investigated and an increased number of referrals for a transplant was a potential factor. But family refusal remained the biggest barrier to all types of organ donation and transplantation, it said. John Forsythe, associate medical director for organ donation and transplantation at NHSBT, said 65 people died on the lung transplant waiting list last year. ""Many of those lives could have been saved or transformed had more families said yes to donation,"" he said. ""Sadly, many donation opportunities are lost every year because families don't know if their loved one wanted to be a donor or not. We urgently need people to tell their families they want to donate."" A new opt-out system for organ donation is planned in England by 2020, where adults will be presumed to be organ donors unless they specifically record their decision not to be. A similar system is in place in Wales. Scotland plans to introduce an opt-out system, and Northern Ireland has also expressed an interest.

"The government has been called on to spend an extra Â£43bn on urban transport Manchester suffers the worst congestion of anywhere in England outside London, according to new transport research. Meanwhile, drivers in Liverpool face the second worst traffic jams, the National Infrastructure Commission (NIC) said. The analysis compared the ease of driving from one part of a city to another at peak and off-peak times. The NIC called for more powers to be devolved to elected mayors to solve congestion. Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham supported the call, tweeting that he was asking the region's transport body to ""to do all it can to minimise road chaos and government to sort out trains"". ""But bottom line: GM needs new transport powers,"" he added. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

A combined area spanning Accrington and Rossendale in Lancashire was the highest-ranked non-""primary urban area"" on the list at 26. NIC chairman Sir John Armitt said the fact cities occupy the first 25 spots demonstrated the need for major new investment on urban transport networks. ""Our metro mayors and city leaders need to be in the driving seat to develop local solutions,"" he added. ""We've called for powers and increased funding to be devolved from Whitehall to local leaders.

UK must tackle 'astonishing' congestion Mayor unveils Â£240m 'Congestion Deal' UK's worst traffic jams revealed The NIC is an independent body established to advise the government on the UK's infrastructure needs. It produced the traffic study as part of its National Infrastructure Assessment, which calls for the government to allocate an extra Â£43bn of funding for improvements to urban transport until 2040. AA president Edmund King backed the NIC's call for improvements to public transport, adding ""traffic jams will remain a fixture of city life"" while drivers feel they have no alternative.

"Is there room on the Labour bus for all of its MPs? The Labour Party is changing - with an influx of new members demanding more of a say over policy and election candidates, and agitating to remove some MPs. What is going on? In a Rotherhithe theatre hall that looks like the perfect setting for Shakespeare, Labour members gather to discuss plans to make it easier for local parties to remove their MPs. It's a meeting that's part of a ""democracy roadshow"" organised by the Jeremy Corbyn-supporting MP Chris Williamson. But talk of this tour being about plots to oust disloyal MPs is much ado about nothing, according to the Derby North MP. ""It's not a hatefest, it's a lovefest,"" Chris Williamson tells the 60 or so people who've come to hear him. Corbyn critics lose no-confidence votes Blair doubts Labour can be 'taken back' Field decides against calling by-election Mr Williamson has been holding meetings like this one across the country all summer while the debate in Labour around the selection rules for Westminster MPs has been gaining traction. Thirteen Labour Party branches are now trying to get the issue of how MPs are selected on to the agenda at the Labour conference in Liverpool later this month. Chris Williamson: It's not a hatefest, it's a lovefest Some are calling for Labour MPs to be subject to mandatory open contests. The Jeremy Corbyn-supporting group Momentum also changed its official position earlier this week in favour of an open selection process. In the theatre hall at Rotherhithe's Sands Films Studio, almost every hand goes up when Mr Williamson asks people who support mandatory re-selection for MPs to raise their hands for a selfie. But then this is an audience made up of left-wingers - some Labour, some not - who have travelled here on a weekday evening to listen to him speak about the subject, so he's probably preaching to the converted. Pascale Mitchell: It's a mechanism to make MPs better Among them is Pascale Mitchell, a former Liberal Democrat who joined Labour in 2013. She helped to organise the event, and invited me along to watch. She says trying to change the rules on selection isn't about getting rid of MPs who do not agree with Jeremy Corbyn. ""It means that the MPs will actually work to be more useful for the local people and the communities, because they're under a bit more scrutiny. ""I don't think it's a mechanism to get rid of MPs, I think it's a mechanism to make MPs better."" Her local Labour MP disagrees. Neil Coyle was elected in Bermondsey and Old Southwark in 2015 -pushing out Lib Dem Simon Hughes, who had held the seat for 32 years. Mr Coyle meets me in a neighbourhood in Bermondsey where knife crime claimed the life of a young man this summer. Neil Coyle: They just want ""Corbyn clones"" He says what voters here ""want to see is a Labour party focused on the struggle they face, on getting crime addressed"". ""This is something the government's getting away with and that's something people should hear more from the Labour Party on,"" he says. ""Instead, we're spending hour after hour, day after day, week after week on internal issues that are irrelevant - by and large - not just to the majority of Labour members, but to the vast majority of voters."" Mr Coyle has been a vocal critic of Jeremy Corbyn's leadership of the Labour Party. He believes that is why his constituency is one of the stops on Chris Williamson's tour - which he says is all about targeting MPs who aren't cheerleaders for the Labour leader. ""This is only coming from those who think that they need more Corbyn clones in Parliament to do better,"" says Mr Coyle. ""Actually I disagree. If this system had been in place in the past who knows, Blair and New Labour could have used it to get rid of Jeremy Corbyn as an MP. ""It's a very dangerous precedent to suggest that any leader should be able to dictate who their MPs are."" The MP said there was ""already a process, the trigger ballot system, which is where members' branches and affiliates can trigger an open selection instead of the automatic retention of their sitting MP"". Under current Labour rules, sitting MPs who wish to stand for re-election are subject to a so-called ""trigger ballot"" process. If more than half of the branches and affiliates in the local constituency vote ""yes"" the MP is reselected. If they vote ""no"", then the process is put to an open selection in which other candidates can stand against the sitting MP. Jack Buck: Selection procedures create a negative atmosphere Chairing this democracy roadshow meeting in south London is Councillor Jack Buck. He joined Labour in 2014, is a member of Momentum and was elected to Southwark Council at the local elections in May this year. He tells me the current system is not fit for purpose. ""I think that the selection procedures at the moment create quite a negative atmosphere. ""The way in which the trigger ballot system works within the party that's been introduced creates this kind of environment of hostility, whereby anybody who wants to see thriving democratic process in the party has to vote against somebody instead of for something. ""I think what Labour party members want is politicians of all stripes putting positive visions forward that they can really get behind and create an atmosphere that's policy-driven."" Policy is another key issue on the agenda at this meeting. Chris Bright: Members don't have enough policy input Chris Bright, who's a member of Camberwell and Peckham CLP and the Southwark Momentum group, re-joined Labour in 2015 on the day Jeremy Corbyn became its leader, after having left the party in the 1980s. He tells me Labour needs to change to meet the needs of the more than half a million-strong membership who want more of a say in its policy direction. ""Members generally feel that they don't have enough input into policy-making. ""We've got a much bigger membership now than in the past and those people want to get engaged in decisions about the direction of the party, national policy, local policy and we feel that the Labour party should be responsive to that and give ordinary members more of an input."" Labour's Democracy Review has been looking at how the grassroots could have a greater say in party matters, and was discussed by the party's ruling body - the National Executive Committee - this week. But de-selection hasn't been included in the review. Speaking to me in Rotherhithe, Chris Williamson said that was why local Labour branches across the country are making their own submissions to get the subject on the agenda at conference. ""The mandatory re-selection is not actually part of the terms of reference of the democracy review. ""There are a few motions that have been forwarded by constituency parties. ""The one that I'm backing and I hope that will get support is the one that's been put forward by Labour International, which is calling for open selections so that sitting MPs are subject to an endorsement process between three years and four years into their term of office."" If the motion does make it onto the conference agenda in Liverpool and enough Labour members vote for it, it could end up becoming party policy.

"Tini Owens moved out of the family home in 2015 Tini Owens desperately wants to divorce her husband. She says she's been unhappy for many years and she feels locked in a loveless marriage. For her, after four decades together and with their children now grown up, it's time to formally end the relationship. But her husband, Hugh Owens, does not feel the same way. He says they still have a few years to enjoy together. He's fighting hard to stop her getting her way and has been successful so far. Their divorce battle goes to the highest court in the UK on Thursday. Five Supreme Court judges will decide whether to let Mrs Owens have her divorce - after lower courts decided she was not entitled to one. They will deliver their judgment later this year. For many family lawyers and judges, the case, although rare, is an example of why divorce laws in England and Wales are outdated and need to change. Even the UK's most senior judge, Baroness Hale - one of the Supreme Court judges overseeing the Owens case - has repeatedlycalled for the laws,externalto be overhauled, describing them as ""confusing"" and ""unjust"". Under current divorce law in England and Wales, a couple have to prove in court that their marriage has irretrievably broken down. At least one of five specific reasons must be shown: adultery unreasonable behaviour desertion after two years two years' separation (if both parties agree to the divorce) five years' separation (if one party does not agree to the divorce) Mrs Owens, who is in her 60s, cited 27 allegations about her husband's ""unreasonable behaviour"" - including that he was ""insensitive"" in his ""manner and tone"", she was ""constantly mistrusted"" and felt unloved. Hugh Owens, a retired businessman, opposes the divorce But a family law judge refused the divorce, saying her allegations were ""of the kind to be expected in marriage"". The Court of Appealagreed that ""in law""the marriage had not broken down. Mrs Owens filed for a divorce in 2015 after moving out of the family home in Broadway, Worcestershire. If her bid in the Supreme Court fails, she will have to wait until 2020 until she can divorce her husband. Her situation is seen as ""highly unusual"" because in most cases neither party contests the divorce and it is granted. It is therefore widely believed that the Owens's divorce would have been allowed by the court for the reasons Mrs Owens gave if Mr Owens, a retired businessman in his 70s, had not contested it. Even when both parties agree to get divorced, couples still have to cite one of the five reasons to prove to the court that their marriage is broken. The most common reasons used by couples are those that allow divorce proceedings to start straight away - adultery and unreasonable behaviour. Lawyers say people will often cite ""behaviour"" reasons in an amicable split as they do not want to wait for the two-year separation period to pass. And this is the one of the key issues - those calling for change insist the current system forces divorcing couples to assign blame in an already painful situation. Chris Sherwood, chief executive of counselling charity Relate, said ""blame needs to be taken out of the system"". ""It's not about making divorce any easier, it's about supporting people to get the outcome they want,"" he told BBC News. ""From our experience, when people are getting divorced it's something that's been long thought through."" He added: ""Having a system that has assigning blame at its heart can be very painful for the couple, but also the children of the relationship."" Reality Check: Are we living happily ever after? The 'diva of divorce' for the world's super rich 'Name the adulterer' says new divorce form Family lawyer Nigel Shepherd, former chair of Resolution - which has campaigned for 30 years for divorce laws to change - agrees. ""What strengthens marriage is people committing to it. But if it's over I don't think making people jump through hoops and making them blame each other helps to keep people together,"" he told BBC News. ""This is a matter of allowing people to come out of a marriage with more dignity, it's about making it more kinder, not easier."" He said people often do not want to wait for the two-year separation period due to financial reasons. ""You need a divorce in order for the court to make certain orders on finances - for example, an order for the sale of a house or an order for a pension share,"" he said. ""So a lot of people, when they decide they want to separate, in order to get on with things and to get those final things sorted out, you have to have the divorce... that's why most people can't afford to, or don't want to, wait for at least two years."" But some believe a ""no-fault"" divorce system would undermine the institution of marriage. Colin Hart, chairman of the Coalition for Marriage and director of the Christian Institute, says a ""pure no-fault"" system would lead to a ""race to the bottom"", with quicker divorces that would ""trivialise marriage"". ""Society has an interest in trying to keep marriages together and I think no-fault divorce is pushing that in the wrong direction,"" he said. But he says the current system is a ""mess"" and gives divorces too easily. He also believes judges and lawyers have undermined the system. ""You can go to some lawyers and they will frame up a divorce and they will say, 'this is how you make an allegation against your spouse',"" he said. ""The judiciary bears a lot of blame for giving divorces on a very trivial basis... the courts have done quite a lot to undermine the seriousness of the fault grounds,"" he added. He fears the Owens versus Owens case will further bolster the case for no-fault divorce. ""The judiciary love no-fault divorce,"" he said. ""The Supreme Court want to get no-fault divorce and I think they want to do that by creating a judgment that really undermines the current law and tries to say that the current situation is so bad that we need a complete no-fault system."" And he believes it is necessary for couples planning to break up to wait a lengthy period of time before their divorce is granted. He said this allows couples to change their minds and helps a person who does not agree to the divorce. ""If you don't want to get divorced, but you are being forced against your will to make all sorts of profound, life-changing arrangements, you should be given time to make those arrangements,"" he said. But Resolution, which represents about 6,500 family lawyers, says a six-month period is suitable for couples to decide. They suggest a system where one or both of the couple give ""a simple notification"" that the marriage has broken down and then six months later, if they still want the divorce, it would be granted. And, crucially, there would be no need to cite a reason. How long are you going to live?

"Kamikaze outsold its nearest competitor - Mama Mia! Here We Go Again - by three copies to one. Eminem's surprise album Kamikaze has made UK chart history. It's the rapper's ninth record in a row to go to number one, breaking the record for most consecutive chart-topping albums - a title previously held by Led Zeppelin and ABBA. Fans and artists tell Radio 1 Newsbeat the milestone confirms Eminem as the ""greatest of all time"". And while plenty agree, some say reaching the landmark means it's ""high-time for him to retire as an act"". Ray BLK thinks that unlike some rappers, Eminem isn't afraid to express himself Speaking to Newsbeat at theGRM Daily Rated Awards, Ray BLK described Eminem's career as ""iconic"". ""He's a rapper who really expresses himself - a lot of other rappers don't do that. Maybe they're afraid to. ""I loved his really comedic phase when he was doing really funny videos as well."" The comedy era of Eminem came early in the rapper's career. Tracks like My Name Is from 1999's The Slim Shady LP and 2002's Without Me were accompanied by videos which often saw him taking on light-hearted storylines. It was the era when Krept & Konan had his music ""on repeat"". Krept and Konan think he's the ""greatest of all time"" ""He is one of the best artists in the world, period. In his creativity, videos - everything. ""Eminem is the GOAT - that's the word that comes to mind straight away when you think about him."" His status hasn't come without controversy though - Eminem's lyrics have always split opinion. We don't have enough time to list the many, many subjects he's rapped questionably about over the years - but the list includes domestic abuse and school shootings. And he's been regularly criticised for the homophobic slurs that have featured in his songs - which evenappearon Kamikaze in a diss directed towards Tyler, The Creator. It's the sort of thing that can't be overlooked, according to leader singer of Imagine Dragons, Dan Reynolds. He tweeted: ""It's never ok to say a word that is filled with hate. I don't care what year you were born in or what meaning it has to you. ""If it contributes to hate and bigotry then it is hateful. period."" Allow Twitter content?

The use of homophobic lyrics is also criticised by Dan Stubbs, Commissioning Editor at NME.

""I think it's a blot on an album that didn't need it. On an album with lots of things to talk about, this one's taken attention because it's shocking."" For producer Steel Banglez, it's the team working around Eminem that have been the most inspiring. ""Mike Elizondo, who works with Dr. Dre, is a producer who I really idolise,"" he says. ""He's the guy behind Lose Yourself and he made a lot of the Marshall Mathers EP. ""I was in the studio with him at the start of this year - his production style is what's influenced me."" Big Narstie says Eminem is a ""lyrical genius"", but wonders whether other artists could potentially achieve similar success with access to the ""money machine that Eminem's got behind him"". ""If someone could throw 30 or 50 million behind my project... wow. ""I'd love to see what he's done being achieved by an independent label with a budget of like, Â£25,000."" Allow Twitter content?

Vikar clearly wasn't a fan of Need Me, which features the singer. And after being disappointed by Revival generally, he wasn't expecting much from Kamikaze. ""But when I heard it I thought, he must have realised the mistakes he was making before. ""He's changed his choppy flows and maybe not working with Rick Rubin helped.

Vikar says it would be a good time for the rapper to start working behind the scenes ""Eminem is a brand so however good or bad his albums are, they're always going to go to number one because he has such a fandom. ""When he released Revival I thought he should have stopped, but it wouldn't have been a very good album for him to retire with.

Also working as a make-up artist, she added she decided to take part in Miss England for ""a bit of fun"". ""If I want to cover myself up and dress modestly why should that be an issue? I am just like the other contestants. ""If I am sending out that message it will motivate other people to participate in a beauty contest."" On a fundraising page she set up for children's charity Beauty with a Purpose, Ms Iftekhar wrote: ""I participated in Miss 2018 in order to show that beauty doesn't have a definition. Everyone is beautiful in their own ways, regardless of their weight, race, colour or shape."" Allow Instagram content? This article contains content provided by Instagram.

Other Miss England 2018 contestants include Sophie Hall - who was left with permanent scars following anacid attack in East London- and mental health campaigner Sarah-Jane Hulyer. Winner Ms Cowie will now represent England at the Miss World competition in Sanya, China, in December. Miss World, which is broadcast to more then 120 countries and is in its 68th year, has regularly attracted criticism for being a ""degrading"" contest. Protests have taken place at the event in previous years, such as in 2011 when about100 demonstrators turned up to object to what they saw as a ""human cattle market"". In 1970, when the contest was held at London's Royal Albert Hall,feminist activists stormed the stage. But organisers saythe pageants ""empower"" women. In 2015,the swimwear round was cut from Miss Worldas organisers felt it was ""old-fashioned and unnecessary"", and said the focus of the competition had shifted focus from physical beauty.

"Leah Cambridge had three heart attacks while under anaesthetic at a clinic in Turkey A mother of three died during ""Brazilian butt lift"" surgery in Turkey when a fat clot blocked one of her arteries, an inquest has found. Why is this procedure increasingly popular and is it more dangerous to have the operation abroad? Leah Cambridge, from Leeds, suffered a massive pulmonary embolism during the operation at a private hospital in Izmir in 2018,a coroner found. The 29-year-old beautician was undergoing a Brazilian Butt Lift (BBL) where fat from the stomach is injected into the buttocks. Ms Cambridge had opted for surgery abroad - which is often cheaper than in the UK - after growing paranoid about excess stomach fat after having children, her partner Mr Franks said. Celebrities such as reality TV star Kim Kardashian are seen as being central to a trend that celebrates women who have a slim waist and a round bottom Her neighbours have described her as ""absolutely stunning"", adding that they believed she had gone to have the treatment against her partner's wishes. And Ms Cambridge is not the first British woman whose quest for the perfect behind ended in tragedy abroad. Joy Williams underwentbuttock augmentation surgery in Bangkok, Thailand, in October 2014. Her wounds became infected, and the 24-year-old, from London, died under anaesthetic. Three years previously, 20-year-old Claudia Aderotimi, from Hackney, east London, died as a result of abotched ""buttock enhancement"" procedure at a US hotel. The BBL procedure is not considered to be any more dangerous than many other types of cosmetic surgery, according to consultant plastic surgeon Bryan Mayou. Scott Franks said he had been left a ""broken man"" after the death of his partner and warned others to think about the risks of cosmetic surgery ""The danger is the surgery being performed by unqualified surgeons outside a clinical setting without appropriate aftercare,"" says Mr Mayou, a member of the British Association of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons. ""If fat is injected deep into muscle tissue and lower down on the buttocks, there is a risk of incorrectly injecting fat into large veins. ""The fat, now an embolus, can pass around the bloodstream, into the lungs and cause death."" Claudia Aderotimi died after an injected substance spread to her organs Mr Franks, 31, told The Sun: ""Leah was under anaesthetic and complications happened due to fat getting deposited in her bloodstream and her oxygen levels fell. ""She was brought back to stable but had three heart attacks and there was nothing they could do."" Plastic surgeons from international societies have set up a taskforce to monitor and report on the BBL procedure, says Mr Mayou. The death rate following the procedure was found to be1 in 3,000,externaland all the fatal cases investigated featured fat emboli being found in the buttock muscle, he says. Keeping Up with the Kardashians star Kylie Jenner has denied having buttock implants The surgeon says he has noticed a rise in the number of bottom-boosting operations at his Cadogan Clinic in Chelsea, west London, in the past four years. ""It's a current fad,"" he explains. ""Years ago everyone wanted to be smaller and they would be saying 'can we have liposuction to make [my bottom] smaller?'"" And that is the technique that would be used if the ""bubble butt"" goes out of fashion and BBL patients want the procedure reversed, he says. Kylie Jenner and the celeb surgery effect Should Love Island surgery ads be banned? Social media linked to cosmetic boom So why the obsession with having a bigger behind? For Mr Mayou, it's down to popular culture celebrating curvier physiques. ""We live in an ethnically diverse world and there is an appreciation of different body shapes from our own, and then these techniques become available that make these shapes achievable."" Celebrities like Kim Kardashian, Kylie Jenner and Cardi B have huge followings on social media where they regularly post photographs flaunting their rounded posteriors. The rapper Cardi B has been open about having filler injected into her bottom Jenner posted a video,externalon her blog in which she attributed her curves to weight gain: ""[I haven't had] ass implants. You know, I used to be 120 [lbs]. I was really skinny. Now I'm pushing like 136. But it's alright, I like the chunkiness."" However, Cardi B has revealed that before she broke on to the music scene she had filler injected into her buttocks in a basement in New York - and the silicone leaked for five days afterwards. In an interview with GQ,she said she paid $800 (Â£564) for the procedure after seeing her stripper colleagues with bigger bottoms earning more than her. Chloe Simms, a star of reality soap The Only Way Is Essex, has been open about the bum-boosting cosmetic surgery she's had, having complained on the show that she had""the flattest bum in Essex"",external.

And as Mr Mayou points out, BBL surgery can be a particularly attractive idea for some women as it's seen as being able to solve two body hang-ups in one go. ""For a lot of people you are really getting two benefits from one operation - removing fat from somewhere they don't want it and putting it somewhere they do,"" he says. In terms of cost, cosmetic surgery is cheaper in countries like Turkey than in the UK, Mr Mayou says. The procedure is used to make buttocks bigger, more rounded or lifted Surgeons may insert silicone-filled implants and/or inject fat transferred from other parts of the body In the UK it tends to cost between Â£2,000 and Â£7,000, depending on the clinic and whether additional work is needed After surgery, patients are likely to have some pain, bruising and discomfort over the area of the implant for a few weeks and are advised not to sit on their buttocks directly for three weeks Complications can include wound infection, rupture of prosthetic implants and fat embolus, where fat can enter the bloodstream and block vessels He estimates a BBL procedure would cost about Â£8,000 in the UK. Some reports state Ms Cambridge paid as little as Â£3,000 for her surgery. ""But we have people travelling from abroad to our clinics in London because our surgeons are qualified, regulated - our clinics are safe - so it's a two-way thing,"" he says. ""I think people are being enticed by heavy marketing; it's all in a foreign language and they have no way of checking if the surgeons are safe,"" Mr Mayou adds. ""It's a commercial enterprise and they are not going to turn down people. They will do everyone whether they are suitable for the operation or not. ""By making the decision to undergo cut-price surgery, patients risk serious complications and even - as this tragic story illustrates - death.""

"'The podcast is useful for people going through other kinds of trauma,' Alison Carter said Following the death of BBC Radio 5 Live presenterRachael Blandat the age of 40, a swell of support and condolence messages have been posted on social media. Her podcast,You, Me and the Big C, which she co-presented with Deborah James and Lauren Mahon, was, and still is, hugely popular. The day before she died, her husband, Steve,tweeted,externalthat they had reached the top of the podcast chart. Alison Carter, a retail manager in London, was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2017 and has written a blog about her own cancer journey. She said she looked forward to every podcast and felt she could relate to so much of what Rachael had said. ""It felt like my generation was talking to me and that's been really powerful,"" she said. Alison Carter says cancer is one of the most challenging things people will face ""So much of the discussions about cancer is around old people. There are a lot of us in our 30s, 40s, 50s who have cancer. ""Rachael clearly had a positive attitude to life which enabled her to talk about the tough stuff too - the impact of 'chemo brain', on body image and on relationships."" Alison said she also took comfort from the frank discussions about the challenges of dealing with family and friends after diagnosis. ""They're not in a place to offer the support that they would like to give,"" she said. ""Cancer can be hugely isolating. Your body goes to a place you've not been through and your support network don't know what you're going through. The podcast was refreshing."" Although she finds it painful to think about it now, Alison found the podcast about death ""the most honest piece of broadcasting I've ever heard"". ""The more we talk about it, the less scary it is,"" she said. ""I get a great sense of comfort from the podcast. ""If you try and joke about cancer, those who haven't got it are shocked. But the podcast was funny, powerful and really helpful."" Roderick is looking forward to listening to the next podcast Roderick Bailey, from Hastings, who was diagnosed with prostate cancer in March 2017, said he had taken great strength from Rachael, Lauren and Deborah's openness but had been staggered at how upset he had been to hear of Rachael's death. ""It felt like somebody really close to me had died. How must her husband, Steve, be feeling?"" he said. He has found the podcast helpful as he prepares for surgery - a prostatectomy - on Monday. ""The tears and laughter have really resonated with me. Rachael's story of one disappointment after another is like mine,"" he said. ""I worked for Cancer Research UK for 23 years. I never thought I'd personally be facing cancer."" Roderick said the rest of his family could not listen to the podcast and felt he was ""too wrapped up in cancer"". ""Everyone is fed up of me talking about it but when it's happening to you, you can't turn yourself off,"" he said. ""I really admire their network of support and the honesty of their chats. I'm looking forward to listening to the next one, which could be from hospital."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Sabrina Carparelli is equally shocked by Rachael's death but in good spirits about her own breast cancer diagnosis, from February 2018.

There are many podcasts out there and there's a reason theirs reached number one. ""Everybody has to face death. There's no shame in talking about it.
