"President Trump said ""incredible"" British PM Boris Johnson called him after getting out of hospital US House passed a $484bn (Â£390bn) stimulus package, with funds for small businesses and virus testing EU leaders agreed to inject billions of euros of emergency aid into Europe's struggling economies UK Health Secretary Matt Hancock said testing will be simpler and faster for essential workers US unemployment claims hit 26.4 million - more than 15% of the workforce WHO revealed 'deeply concerning' estimate that half of European Covid-19 deaths occurred in care homes Edited by Jude Sheerin Thanks for being with us during another busy day as the world continues to battle the coronavirus pandemic. Some of the main developments today:  Today's live page was written by our journalists in Australia, Singapore, India, the UK and US: Anna Jones, Yvette Tan, Andreas Illmer, Krutika Pathi, Frances Mao, Kelly-Leigh Cooper, Alexandra Fouche, Rebecca Morton, Dulcie Lee, Saj Chowdhury, Michael Emons,  Emlyn Begley, Marie Jackson, Rob Greenall, Lucy Webster, Paul Seddon, Yaroslav Lukov, Holly Hondereich, Ritu Prasad, Ian Youngs, Helier Cheung and Jude Sheerin. Anthony ZurcherBBC North America reporter The harsh political reality for the president is he faces a re-election contest in just over six months, and the longer the lockdown drags on, the less time the economy will have to recover before voters head to the ballot box. Current polling suggests he is trailing presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden nationally and in key battleground states, and while the race is likely to tighten and the president has abundant resources to run a robust campaign, Trump appears destined for an uphill fight. The president also faces a flip-side risk of being seen as supporting re-opening too quickly and shouldering the blame if there is a subsequent spike in cases. That could explain why, just days after calling for states to begin reopening process, he criticised the Republican governor of Georgia for lifting restrictions on places like hair salons, bars and tattoo parlours, where social distancing guidelines would be difficult to follow. It's a difficult line for any politician to walk, and in the days ahead the stakes will be at their highest. Here's Anthony's full piece:Coronavirus pandemic exposes rather than heals America's divisions Trump was also asked how the November presidential election could go ahead amid the coronavirus outbreak. ""I can't tell you what's going to happen in an election,"" Trump says. ""We have a sleepy guy in a basement of a house that the press is giving a free pass to, who doesn't want to do debates because of Covid,"" he says of former Vice-President Joe Biden, his likely Democratic challenger, whom he often calls ""Sleepy Joe"". ""I watched a couple of interviews, and I say 'Oh I look forward to this,'"" Trump says. ""But they're keeping him sheltered."" Biden cancelled all in-person campaign events beginning in mid-March as social-distancing measures were ordered throughout the US. He has continued to hold interviews and digital fundraisers from his home in Delaware, and launched a podcast last month. In an interview today, Biden said he was ""ready to debate"" Trump. ""Zoom or Skype or Slack or hangouts or in person, anytime, anywhere he wants."" The US president also claimed knowledge in the fields of medicine and economics during the news conference. ""I'm not a doctor but I'm a person who has a good you-know-what,"" he said at one point, apparently gesturing to his brain. At another point: ""I know a lot about economists and the answer is they have no idea. I think I have as good of an idea as anybody."" Captain Tom Moore, the 99-year-old British Army veteran who has raised Â£28.5m ($35m) for the NHS, could be number one in the UK music charts this weekend - but he's in a tight race with a Canadian pop star. A version of You'll Never Walk Alone featuring the voice of Captain Tom was thought to be on course to be number one, but earlier on Thursday, The Weeknd's Blinding Lights overtook him. However, in a late twist, The Weeknd has now thrown his weight behind Captain Tom. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The number one will be revealed just before 18:00 BST on Friday. The briefing is now over but to recap, Trump launched an extraordinary attack on his ally, Georgia Governor Brian Kemp, over his aggressive reopening plan for his state. ""I want the states to open, more than he does, much more than he does,"" Trump says of Kemp. ""But I didn't like to see spas [reopening] at this early stage, nor did the doctors."" Kemp said hair salons, gyms, bowling alleys and nail salons would be allowed to reopen on Friday, with restaurants following suit on Monday. ""I didn't like to see a lot of things happening, and I wasn't happy with it, and I wasn't happy with Brian Kemp,"" Trump says. ""I could have done something about it if I wanted to, but I'm saying, 'Let the governors do it.'"" The BBC's Jon Sopel asks Trump how British Prime Minister Boris Johnson was when he spoke to him this week. ""He called me a few days ago, I will tell you he sounded incredible. I was actually surprisedâ¦ he was ready to go, Iâm very surprised to tell you this, itâs like, the old Boris, tremendous energy, tremendous drive."" He adds: ""Because he called me almost pretty close to when he got out of the hospital, I think heâs doing great, he was so sharp and energetic, pretty incredible, heâs an incredible guy, heâs a friend of ours and a friend of mine, he loves our country, he loves his country a lotâ¦ and theyâre lucky to have him over there."" Trump is asked about the new guidance suggesting the virus is vulnerable to heat and humidity, particularly given that countries with hot weather, like Singapore, have also been hit by the outbreak. ""I hope people enjoy the sun,"" Trump says. ""And if it has an impact that's great.... maybe you can, maybe you can't. I'm not a doctor"" He then asks Dr Deborah Birx, a co-ordinator of the White House virus response whether heat can help kill the virus. ""Deborah have you ever heard of that? The heat, and the light relative to certain viruses, yes, but to this virus?"" ""Not as a treatment,"" Dr Birx says. ""I mean, certainly, fever, is a good thing. When you have a fever it helps your body respond."" But she does not believe it works as a treatment, she repeats. Katya AdlerEurope Editor Very
aware of the negative headlines of late, depicting EU leader v EU leader; the
rich and frugal North v the suffering, spendthrift South, there was a
determination at Thursdayâs EU summit to avoid the verbal fisticuffs. There was no
walkout by ""Angry Italy"". No fuming about Eurobonds by the Dutch. Instead EU
leaders signed off, as expected, on a pre-agreed â¬500bn ($540bn; Â£435bn) emergency
financial package and on guidelines for lifting Covid-19 restrictions. Heated
discussion about a recovery plan for European economies after the health
crisis was left for another day - the buck passed to the European Commission
which now has the unenviable task of conjuring up a proposal  acceptable
to divided EU opinion. Today at least, EU leaders were keen to present a united
front. Their underlying intended message: âYes, we argue but EU solidarity
exists. We muddle our way through in the end.â Trump is asked why he has stopped promoting hydroxychloroquine, a malaria and lupus medication, as a possible treatment for coronavirus. âI havenât at all... weâll see what happens,â he says. The president's public remarks hyping the drug have decreased substantially over the past week or so. He says today he hasnât seen a recent study that said coronavirus patients taking hydroxychloroquine had higher death rates. That research followed 368 patients at US Veterans Health Administration medical centres. The 97 patients who took hydroxychloroquine had a 27.8% death rate. The 158 patients who did not take the drug had an 11.4% death rate. The BBC's Jon Sopel asks a question about the new guidance suggesting the virus is vulnerable to heat and humidity. ""At the moment the advice is stay at home, by the summer could we be flipping that, and saying you'll be much better off being outside?"" Sopel asks. ""I would not go contrary to the guidance that has been issued right now,"" Bryan says. He adds: ""If I'm having an event with my family, I'm doing it in the driveway or the backyard, not inside the house."" ""In fact I'm thinking about moving outside to the rose garden,"" Trump jokes. William Bryan, the under secretary for science and technology at the US Department of Homeland Security, says the coronavirus may be killed faster under increased temperature, humidity and sunlight. ""We identified that heat and humidity is a weakness"" of the virus' ability to spread, Bryan says, showing data suggesting that the virus could survive for 90 seconds under direct sunlight, and for 90 minutes without any solar contact. The findings are an ""emerging"" result of their work, Bryan says. Helier CheungBBC News, Washington DC More than 26 million Americans have filed for unemployment in the past five weeks - over 15% of the US workforce. One American who has lost her job recently is Rachel Sterner, who worked as a stage manager for the Broadway production of Harry Potter and the Cursed Child. She says: ""I loved my job - it was my responsibility to maintain the artistic integrity of the show, and it's a challenging and beautiful show. ""Working in theatre means being laid off is not a foreign concept - but normally, if you lose a job, you can get on another project. This is different - there won't be work for a long time. ""Even if we do a show at half-capacity, who knows how long it'll be till tourists come back, and people have disposable income for the theatre?"" You can read more of the human stories behind the unemployment figureshere. Meanwhile, the US House of Representatives has voted 388-5 to pass a $484bn (Â£390bn) emergency aid bill meant to replenish depleted relief programs for small businesses. The bill, passed by the Senate earlier this week, will also provide funding for hospitals and coronavirus testing. It will not provide money to state governments. Lawmakers donned face masks and maintained social distancing as they assembled in the Capitol today. To vote, members were divided alphabetically into groups of roughly 60 people and were asked to stay in their offices until their group was called. Vice-President Mike Pence says that 4.93 million coronavirus tests have been completed across the US, adding that commercial labs surpassed 100,000 tests yesterday. Pence says that he is ""encouraged"" by states' ""phased approach"" to reopening their economies. ""We're slowing the spread, we're protecting the most vulnerable, we're saving lives and every single day we are one day closer to opening up America again,"" Pence says. Taking the stage after Donald Trump, Vice-President Mike Pence says the data continues to show ""promising signs of progress"" in the US fight against coronavirus. Major virus hotspots including the New York Metro Area, New Jersey, Connecticut, Detroit and New Orleans ""all appear to be past their peak"", Pence says. ""Our only conclusion is that we're getting there, America,"" he adds. ""If we continue these mitigation efforts in the days ahead... we do believe by early summer we could be in a much better place as a nation, with much of this coronavirus epidemic behind us."" He says 16 states have released formal reopening plans so far. An Ohio family has cancelled plans to livestream the funeral of
father-of-two John McDaniel, who died on 15 April after testing positive for
Covid-19, after a deluge of backlash against his social media posts criticising
stay-home orders. In
a statement, McDaniel's wife of more than 30 years, Lisa McDaniel, wrote that
the livestream would be cancelled as ""John's story, along with early
assumptions that he stated on Twitter and Facebook had turned into national
news"". ""This
news has opened flood gates for people to share their own misguided anger and
unfounded assumptions about a man they don't know."" McDaniel's
posts disparaged stay home mandates ordered by Ohio Governor Mike DeWine, and
called the virus response ""madness"". ""As
each day passes, we are all learning more about this 'invisible enemy,'""
Lisa wrote. ""We know if John was still here with us he would acknowledge
the national crisis we are in, abide by the stay-at-home-order, and encourage
family and friends to do the same."" In his obituary, McDaniel is described as an
""outdoorsman"", a loving father and husband, and an ""ornery
son-of-a-gun"". Donald Trump says ""we are very close to a vaccine"", after noting vaccine trials taking place in the US, Germany, the United Kingdom and China. ""We have a lot of great, brilliant minds working on this,"" he says. ""Unfortunately we're not very close to testing because when testing starts it takes a period of time, but we'll get it done."" Dr Anthony Fauci, the US government's top infectious diseases expert, has previously said that a vaccine will likely take 12-18 months to be approved for widespread use. Most health experts also agree that it would take at least 12-18 months before a vaccine is ready. The first human trial in Europe of a coronavirus vaccine has begun in the UK US President Donald Trump has taken the podium for his daily White House coronavirus briefing. He is joined by Vice-President Mike Pence and Deborah Birx, the White House coronavirus taskforce co-ordinator. Gilead Sciences is headquartered in the US state of California A closely-watched Gilead Sciences Inc experimental antiviral drug failed to help patients with severe Covid-19 in a clinical trial conducted in China, Reuters reports. But the US company said in a statement that the study's results were ""inconclusive"" because it was terminated early due to ""low enrolment"".   Allow Twitter content?

It comes days after another report detailed rapid recovery in fever and respiratory symptoms in some patients with Covid-19 who were treated with experimental drug remdesivir at the University of Chicago Medicine hospital. Interest in Gilead's remdesivir has been high as there are currently no approved treatments or preventive vaccines for Covid-19. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Not all families have laptops and broadband to help their children keep learning at home ""In our schools, 60% to 70% of children wouldn't have laptops,"" says Wayne Norrie, head of an academy trust with schools in disadvantaged areas. With schools closed and pupils studying online at home, he says, it is important to recognise the social gap in access to technology. ""Coronavirus has revealed the scale of the digital divide,"" he says. The Department for Education in England has promised laptops will be lent to some poorer teenagers. These will be available to disadvantaged Year 10 pupils without access to a computer, and those with social workers. The scheme, announced last Sunday, for un unspecified number of laptops, is expected to soon start taking bids from local authorities and academy trusts. Mr Norrie, chief executive of Greenwood Academies Trust, with 37 schools in the Midlands and east of England, says many families rely on a single mobile phone for an internet connection, which is ""not realistic"" for online learning and streaming video lessons. ""Many don't have broadband contracts,"" he says. Laptops promised for disadvantaged teenagers studying at home Not easy for families with pupils trying to learn at home A fifth of people do not use the internet For instance, he describes a family in Skegness who have a mobile phone shared between parents and three children. The schools have been providing laptops and some families have their own tablet computers - but there are still barriers in terms of parents' IT skills and children having space to study. The Department for Education is promising to lend laptops to some teenagers ""Digital poverty"" is a significant problem, says Matt Morden, co-head teacher of Surrey Square primary school, in south London. In his school, 24% of pupils are effectively offline, in terms of being able to study from home. Their families might have mobile phones with internet connections - but for those in low-paid, insecure jobs, data is expensive. ""If families are struggling, the priority is going to be food, not data,"" he says. As well as missing out on learning, those without online connections miss ""the sense of belonging"" from staying in touch with their friends and teachers, Mr Morden says. The lockdown and the closure of schools has ""brought the digital divide to the forefront"", he says. There are digital haves and have-nots in the coronavirus lockdown There has been anew virtual academy launchedand the BBC has provided educational resources - but those without internet access or usable computer devices are being left behind. Mr Morden's school has been lending laptops - but for families with several school-age children, one might not be enough.

Chris Tomlinson, who chairs the trust, says online lessons are ""no good if the children don't have the necessary hardware to access the internet"". The AET academy trust is providing 9,000 laptops for its 58 schools, one for all pupils on free school meals. The current lockdown has turned technology into an educational necessity rather than a luxury, said the trust's chief executive, Julian Drinkall Robert Halfon, chair of the education select committee, says too often there are assumptions about access to broadband and up-to-date computers.

"Chancellor Merkel has been widely praised for her handling of the crisis German Chancellor Angela Merkel has said her country must remain ""clever and cautious"" in handling the coronavirus crisis, as it is ""not the end phase but still just the beginning"". ""We'll have to live with this virus for a long time,"" Ms Merkel told parliament ahead of an EU summit, via videolink. She said Germany should be ready to ""make very different, meaning much higher contributions to the EU budget"". The video summit - the EU's fourth on coronavirus - is now under way. EU leaders are expected to sign off on a new â¬540bn (Â£470bn; $575bn) emergency fund to protect European workers, businesses and countries worst affected by the coronavirus outbreak. The details are yet to be worked out. The â¬540bn would be released through EU institutions that already exist, including the European Stability Mechanism (ESM), the main bailout fund set up in response to the 2008 financial crisis. EU summit chairman Charles Michel videoconferencing with leaders European Council President Charles Michel told leaders,externalthey should aim to start releasing the funds by 1 June. But a thornier issue is how much extra to commit to the EU budget to deal with this crisis, and how much the 27 member states will spend jointly. There are plans for a special recovery fund, like the post-1945 Marshall Plan. Italy and some other states want EU help in aid grants, not loans. The scale of the crisis is such, they argue, that at least â¬1.5 trillion will be needed. Mrs Merkel said extra EU budget funds should be provided ""in a spirit of solidarity"" and for a limited time. Germany has brought the infection rate down considerably Italy, at the epicentre of the pandemic in Europe, has been especially vocal in urging its EU partners to jointly guarantee debt. But Germany, the Netherlands and Austria oppose any mutualisation of debt, in the form of so-called ""coronabonds"". Under current EU rules countries cannot be made liable for each other's debts. The old rifts from the eurozone crisis of 2009 - a supposedly frugal northern Europe versus a spendthrift south - have re-emerged with this outbreak. The view from Rome is that a shared crisis needs a shared solution. Facing fierce opposition mainly from Germany and the Netherlands, Italy may no longer be wedded to its idea of ""coronabonds"" - debt mutualisation - but is still pushing for a financial package that does not penalise any single economy. That, after all, is the spirit of the common market that Italy helped create. Many Italians feel abandoned by an EU that has hoarded protective equipment and closed borders. Polls show anti-EU feeling is at its highest ever here. The leader of the hard-right Brothers of Italy party, Giorgia Meloni, told me the EU had shown its inadequacy and distance from the solidarity its members craved, peddling the idea of Italy as a beggar, wasting its money. ""The EU exists thanks to Italy,"" she said. ""But it's now a system that favours others."" Hers is the party steadily rising in the polls. Why fractious EU still believes together is better Face masks to be compulsory across Germany What can the UK learn from Germany on testing? French President Emmanuel Macron has sided with Italy and Spain in this crisis, warning that it threatens the very existence of the EU. Italy, Spain and France - in that order - have the highest European death tolls from Covid-19, each above 20,000. On Thursday German officials said coronavirus cases nationally had risen to 148,046, and the number of deaths linked to Covid-19 had risen by 215 to 5,094. Mrs Merkel said ""it's the biggest challenge since World War Two, for the life and health of our people"". A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? AVOIDING CONTACT:The rules on self-isolation and exercise HOPE AND LOSS:Your coronavirus stories VIDEO:The 20-second hand wash STRESS:How to look after your mental health She urged ""maximum discipline"", to avoid stop-start lockdowns. ""We must not waste what has been achieved already,"" she said, praising the efficiency of Germany's healthcare system and the armed forces' role. ""The question of how we can prevent the virus from overwhelming our health system and subsequently costing the lives of countless people, this question will for a long time be the central question for politics in Germany and Europe."" This video can not be played 'Make no mistake, we remain in very turbulent water' - WHO's Dr Hans Kluge The World Health Organization (WHO) says care home residents account for up to half of Covid-19 deaths in Europe, which is ""a deeply concerning picture"". Mrs Merkel said Europe must strengthen its capacity to produce specialised medical kit, instead of depending on global supplies, which are now very stretched. She also called the WHO an indispensable partner in the fight against the virus. President Donald Trump has suspended US funding of the body. ""I know how difficult the restrictions are, it's a challenge to democracy, it limits our democratic rights,"" she said, adding that democratic transparency, such as a free press, helped to make the situation tolerable. ""It's amazing how much understanding people have shown for each other,"" she said. MPs frequently applauded her.

Brian TaylorBBC Scotland Political Editor Perhaps it is the miasma of partisan politics. Perhaps it is scrutiny from the wicked media. Perhaps it is instinctive. Whatever the cause, political leaders generally like to exude certainty. They will say: ""I believe I have been completely clear about this"" Or: ""Let me assure the Houseâ¦â¦"" By contrast, many ministers of my acquaintance have been in an honourable lather of uncertainty much of the time. That is because the decisions confronting them are tough, really tough. But they pretend otherwise. They fear to let it seem that they are havering or dovering, to use two fine Scots words. Nicola Sturgeon has, to a large extent, abandoned the pretence. In all her remarkable pronouncements during this quite remarkable period, she has constantly stressed that she may have to change tack, that she is open to other ideas. That she is, in short, uncertain. Indeed, she used the word ""uncertainty"" repeatedly today as she set out her framework for a possible exit strategy.

Children in Need and Comic Relief have joined forces for the first time for a BBC fundraising telethon. BBC One's Big Night In, which begins at 19:00, will include the unveiling of a home-made video for a charity single featuring stars like Dua Lipa, Chris Martin and Rita Ora. Little Britain, Peter Kay, The Vicar of Dibley and Catherine Tate will all also return during the three-hour special. The show will aim to raise millions of pounds for vulnerable people around the UK who have been affected by the pandemic. The government has pledged to match all public donations, with a minimum of Â£20 million. Alex MurrayBBC News Analysis by BBC News suggests some 103 healthcare workers are now believed to have died from coronavirus. 53 were men, 49 women. Black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) people represent 65 of those deaths, where we have been able to establish ethnicity. 13 have been reported as Filipino. We've been unable to verify whether these people tested positive for the virus. Instead, our information comes from public reports where the family or workplace have said their death was related to Covid-19. Of the doctors who we believe were working in a hospital environment, all 16 were BAME and male, with a significant majority over 50. Medical staff account for 22 deaths; nursing and midwifery 34 deaths; allied occupations 47 deaths. It is unclear how many contracted the virus in the course of their work in the health sector. Separate analysis by Health Service Journal,externalsuggest that the rate of death is ""largely consistent with the number of healthcare workers in the population"". BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg asks Matt Hancock about the governmentâs transparency on what comes next â it comes after theScottish government today set out its lockdown exit strategy. Matt Hancock says he understands the ""thirst for knowledge"", but the five tests the UK government has set out are âcriticalâ. He says the ""message remains the same â that people need to stay at home to protect the NHS and save lives"". ""It is succeedingâ¦ but we are not through that yet and there is still a lot of work to be done."" Here our health correspondent looks at the UK governmentâs five tests. Drivetime with John BeattieBBC Radio Scotland Deputy First Minister John Swinney explains the decision on reopening schools will be based entirely on the public health advice. We must be satisfied transmission has been suppressed Mr Swinney says. ""We've got to be really careful about what we do to fuel the spread of the virus because we have more social interaction."" We may be able to open schools to a small amount of pupils, the education secretary says, suggesting this could be those due to sit their national qualifications in 2021 or those transitioning from primary to secondary school or those starting P1.

Education Secretary John Swinney took virtual questions from MSPs earlier today And Ms Sturgeon said Scotland was not yet able to begin to ease its lockdown. The first minister was speaking as the Scottish governmentpublished a new document,externaloutlining the basis of an exit strategy from the UK-wide lockdown that has been in place since 23 March.

Sir Harry Burns said social distancing will need to continue when lockdown restrictions begin to lift, which would not be possible at big events. However, he said he suspects a vaccine will be available sooner than 18 months. Sir Harry described that framework set out by Nicola Sturgeon today as ""very sensible"".

"Online retailer Amazon, long accused of killing off bricks-and-mortar book sales, has stunned the industry by donating Â£250,000 to a fund in aid of bookshops hit by coronavirus. The tech giant initially made the donation on a ""low-key"" basis, said the Book Trade Charity. But as speculation grew, the charity revealed that Amazon was the donor. Chief executive David Hicks said he realised some booksellers would find that difficult. He told the BBC that the Book Trade Charity existed to help the entire book industry, from publishers to bookshops. As part of its efforts, it is running a fund to help booksellers facing financial hardship after being forced to close by the pandemic. Mr Hicks said: ""Amazon came to us and said they would like to put some money into our fund, particularly to help at this time and that they would prefer it to be low-key."" As a result, the charity tried to avoid naming Amazon, although the firm had not insisted on anonymity, he said. However, that policy simply led to more questions, especially after trade publication, the Bookseller, ran a story saying a mystery donor had contributed Â£250,000 of the Â£380,000 raised so far. Mr Hicks said he had been ""very pleased"" to accept the donation in the interests of the charity. However, he added that he was ""conscious that that does give a little bit of difficulty to some booksellers"". ""A large part of the trade, particularly on the publishing side, works very closely with Amazon,"" he said. ""But the bookselling side does have rather a more strained relationship.""

"The DIY store has reopened some outlets amid UK lockdown measures DIY chain B&Q has confirmed it has now reopened 155 of its UK stores as lockdown measures remain in place. After a trial at 14 stores at the weekend, 61 outlets reopened on Wednesday and another 80 on Thursday. B&Q has introduced ""social distancing controls"", such as capping the number of customers in-store. On Thursday, other firms including Jaguar Land Rover, Aston Martin and Taylor Wimpey said they would return to work in May. B&Q had closed its shops since the end of March after the government introduced lockdown measures to try to contain the spread of Covid-19. However, hardware shops were included on the government's list of essential retailers that were allowed to trade under the restrictions and B&Q customers could continue to shop online. Businesses adapting to life under lockdown Social restrictions 'to remain for rest of year' The DIY chain said on Saturday that 14 of its stores would reopen,followed by a further 61 sites announced on Wednesday,external. In the newly re-opened stores, perspex screens will be fitted to checkouts and two-metre floor markers will indicate the distance shoppers should maintain from each other. The announcement also saw complaints that the retailer would be allowed to sell plants at its sites which have garden centres. The Horticultural Trades Association (HTA) recently told the BBCthat millions of plants and shrubs might have to be binned as, unlike hardware firms, garden centres were deemed non-essential. UK manufacturers and housebuilders announced plans on Thursday to kickstart production during the lockdown. Carmaker Jaguar Land Rover said it would resume production gradually at its factory at Solihull and at its engine manufacturing plant in Wolverhampton from 18 May. It will also reopen its facilities in Slovakia and Austria. The company said the restart of other factories, which include Castle Bromwich and Halewood, will be confirmed in due course. Luxury carmaker Aston Martin said it would reopen its St Athan plant on 5 May after it had temporarily suspended all manufacturing operations in the UK at the end of March. Housebuilder Taylor Wimpey also plans to restart work on most of its building sites across England and Wales in May. Its staff will follow new safety guidelines, while subcontractor work will resume the following week. Peter Redfern, Taylor Wimpey's chief executive said: ""In the period while our sites have been closed, trading has inevitably been impacted. However, we are still seeing continued demand for our homes and our sales teams have been selling homes remotely, and digitally, week to week."" He added that the firm's show homes and sales centres would remain closed, most likely until social distancing measures are relaxed. David O'Brien, an equity analyst at Goodbody, added that Taylor Wimpey is ""in a strong position to ramp up activity"". As Spanish authorities have relaxed some lockdown measures, he added, those operations could provide ""helpful lessons"" and highlight ""potential issues ahead of UK site openings which will also stand it in good stead"". Meanwhile, housebuilder Vistry - formerly Bovis Homes - announced construction would resume on most of its ""partnership sites"", which are typically affordable housing projects, from 27 April. The firm added that a ""significant"" number of private housing construction sites would also reopen. William Ryder, equities analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said that ""any return to activity will be welcome"". ""Demand for new houses definitely seems to been reduced by the current uncertainty, but it doesn't seem to be as bad as some had feared. However, it's possible that things will get worse from here if we enter a prolonged recession,"" he said. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself?

"The carrier had been due to sail from Portsmouth on Tuesday A planned sailing of the aircraft carrier HMS Queen Elizabeth has been postponed while crew members are tested for coronavirus. The carrier had been due to sail from Portsmouth on Tuesday for a period of sea training with 800 crew onboard. The navy had initially planned for it to sail without any of the crew being tested beforehand. However, in the last 24 hours it reversed the decision saying there was extra capacity in testing. On Wednesday, Defence Secretary Ben Wallace was asked by MPs about the plans to allow the carrier to go to sea given recent Covid-19 outbreaks on a number of US carriers and the French navy's Charles de Gaulle. Mr Wallace told MPs that he had given the captain of HMS Queen Elizabeth full authority to return to port if there was an outbreak and it was deemed necessary. The 65,000-tonne carrier HMS Queen Elizabeth is the largest warship ever to be built in Britain However, the navy has since announced there would be a ""short but manageable delay in sailing"" until at least Thursday. A navy spokesman said: ""In addition to an isolation period at sea, the Royal Navy is now making use of spare NHS testing capacity to test the crew of HMS Queen Elizabeth prior to sailing. ""This is the right and sensible thing to do to ensure the Navy can continue to deliver on operations now and in the future. ""She will be operating in waters close to the UK coast and the commanding officer has the discretion to cease the training, if deemed necessary.""

"The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge's son Prince Louis has been photographed making a colourful rainbow poster - a symbol of hope during the coronavirus lockdown - to mark his second birthday. His handprint artwork is one of several photographs released by the family to celebrate the occasion on Thursday. Similar pictures by children haveappeared in windows across the country. Prince Louis was photographed by his mother the Duchess of Cambridge in Norfolk earlier this month. In a series of images, Kate has captured her son - wearing a smart blue gingham-style shirt - grinning up at the camera while displaying his brightly painted palms and fingers. In one portrait, his coloured digits are raised to his cheeks with apparent excitement. In another photo, Louis has smeared colourful paint all over his face, with Kensington Palaceposting a light-hearted tweet,externalsaying ""Instagram Vs Reality"". The duchess - a keen amateur photographer and patron of the Royal Photographic Society - has regularly released pictures she has taken of her other children, Prince George and Princess Charlotte, to mark their birthdays. Louis' artwork is likely to be part of William and Kate's home-schooling lessons, with the duchess recently admitting she kept the make-shift classroomup and running during the Easter holidays. ""It's just having that bit of structure, actually. It's great, there are so many great tips online and fun activities that you can do with the children so it hasn't been all hardcore,"" she said. Kate also revealed her surprise at her children's awareness about the coronavirus outbreak and how she has tackled the subject with them in ""age appropriate"" ways. Prince Louis Arthur Charles of Cambridge, fifth in line to the throne, was born on St George's Day, 23 April 2018, at the private Lindo Wing of St Mary's Hospital in Paddington, London, weighing 8lb 7oz. He was christened at 11 weeks old, by Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby, in the Chapel Royal at St James's Palace in front of friends and family. Prince Louis has featured in a number of images released by the Cambridges and recently appeared in a video with his older brother and sister applauding the nation's health workers and carers. Prince Charles and his wife the Duchess of Cornwall wished their grandson a ""very happy birthday"" from their Clarence House twitter account. Allow Twitter content?

"EU leaders will meet by video for their summit on Thursday ""EU in disarray!"" scream headlines since the start of the Covid-19 pandemic. Brussels is depicted as ""weak""; EU member states as ""feuding"". You find endless analyses online focusing on the ""lack of solidarity"" shown by the rich EU North: Germany, the Netherlands, Austria, Finland - the ""frugals"" as they've been dubbed - towards the suffering South - i.e. Italy and Spain. In the UK, the EU's handling of coronavirus feeds into what's left of the Brexit debate. The UK has already left the EU, of course, but Remainer/Leaver resentments linger. And the question of how close the UK remains to Brussels in the future is not yet enshrined in law. Does EU behaviour during the pandemic mean we were right to leave or wrong? Twitter is not exactly short of thoughts on that subject. But are media depictions of the EU and its members so far during this crisis entirely accurate? ""Are they ever?"" huffed a key Brussels figure when I asked him. ""We've had ugly moments but by now the achievements are stacking up. The massive ECB (European Central Bank) stimulus package was just the beginning. Thursday is a big day."" EU leaders meet by video-conference for a summit on Thursday afternoon. They're expected to sign off on a new â¬540bn (Â£470bn; $575bn) emergency fund to protect European workers, businesses and countries worst affected by the coronavirus outbreak. The Italian prime minister needs to show he is being listened to in Brussels The fund was difficult to agree between member states but they got there in the end. After considerable push and pull, plus a dramatic intervention by French President Emmanuel Macron, who threatened the end of the EU if agreement wasn't found. ""So much for us failing to show solidarity with Italy,"" snorted a Dutch colleague to me. ""It's a generous package."" Are EU divisions banished after the coronavirus deal? Tailor-made lockdown easing for European countries What is the EU equipment row all about? Financial crisis 'on steroids' facing EU leaders Angela Merkel's preferred wording was that solidarity had been shown towards Italy and the South. It would continue to be shown in the future, she said. Brussels boasts that, in addition to the fund, EU members have been sharing protective medical equipment and specialist medical teams with one another. The German military has airlifted coronavirus patients from the heart of Italy's pandemic for treatment in Germany In some cases, they've also been treating each other's patients. According to German newspaper SÃ¼ddeutsche Zeitung, the cost of providing treatment to patients coming from abroad has cost the German taxpayer â¬20m so far. On Thursday, EU leaders are also expected to approve common measures for gradually lifting coronavirus restrictions. This does not mean coordinating an EU-wide End of Lockdown. Each country has its own health service, with different infection patterns, different lockdown measures in place. Would the spread of coronavirus have been more easily contained if all EU countries and their neighbours had taken early and uniform precautions? Indubitably, say medical experts. But that kind of agreed action hasn't been possible amongst the states of the United States of America. It was never going to happen between 27 independent EU countries, with their varying forms of government (federal, regional etc). Brussels admits every member state will now ""tailor-make"" their exit strategy from lockdown but it wants them to at least inform one other in advance, to avoid complications for people working across national borders. The Commission has also asked that no EU country lift its Covid-19 restrictions unless: The number of deaths/infections in that country has been reducing and stable for a sustained period of time The national health service could cope with a surge of new infections if necessary The EU country in question has enough testing capacity to identify and quarantine new infections plus people they have recently been in contact with, in order to keep those who have not yet had the virus safe. EU leaders are broadly in agreement with all of this, but smiles could turn to gritted teeth when they then turn their attention to the future. One of the summit priorities on Thursday is to discuss a Recovery Plan for Europe: aimed at getting European economies back on their feet after the health crisis is over. The kind of figure that's being discussed is around â¬1-1.5 trillion. This video can not be played Italyâs lockdown puts restaurants out of business The main recipients would be European countries with the weakest economies. France's President Macron wants the programme to be time-limited to about five years. He hopes it will be ""oven-ready"", signed off by parliaments across the EU, by the end of the year. But where the plan is still vague and contested is what form funds should take: loans or grants? Should the money be raised as part of the next EU budget (which needs to be decided by the December) or alongside? As always, national politics is key. The German chancellor will leave office in 2021 Apart from Germany's Angela Merkel - who will not want the EU to fall apart in her last term in office - the big players in this debate are all vying to be re-elected. They're keen to prove their credentials to a domestic audience. With an eye on Eurosceptic politicians at home, the Dutch prime minister wants to be seen to be protecting Dutch taxpayers' money on the European stage. Italy's prime minister also needs to show he's sticking up for his country in Brussels. Italy was one of the EU's most Eurosceptic nations even before the coronavirus crisis. And France? Emmanuel Macron is always looking over his shoulder at arch-Eurosceptic and political rival Marine Le Pen. He's trying to weave a delicate dance between giving the French the impression that he's leading the post-virus recovery charge in Europe, while trying to get extra cash for the countries of the Mediterranean (including France), yet trying hard not to alienate Berlin, which he hopes will foot the largest chunk of the bill. Quite the juggling act. The French (and Italian and Spanish) argument is now refocused, not on solidarity but self-interest. Their message to the frugal North: we all benefit from the single market. It's worth spending a bit more in the wake of the Covid-19 crisis to rebalance inequalities between members to make the market more competitive and lucrative in the long term. Otherwise you risk the market faltering altogether. President Macron wants the EU's Recovery Plan signed off this year and limited to five years This message dovetails with the ambitions of the still relatively new presidents of the European Commission and the European Council. They believe coronavirus has made the failings in the way China and the US function glaringly obvious. They hope that will make way for a reborn and rebooted EU to play a bigger role on the world stage - economically, in terms of a Green revolution, and digitally - after the crisis is over. This, anyway, is the cherished dream in Brussels right now. And as part of such a long wishlist, the details of the post-health crisis Recovery Fund are unlikely to be agreed anytime soon. Following their Thursday summit, EU leaders will ask the European Commission to come up with concrete proposals but insiders say the painful process of compromise over the fund and the new EU budget is only likely to happen when leaders sit together in person. And who knows when that will next be? In the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis, there were calls all over the EU to leave the bloc. This time it's different. Eurosceptic politicians haven't gone away. Plenty of voters are still critical of Brussels. But the call to leave the EU altogether has broadly fallen silent. EU relations are messy and further complicated by national politics but most EU leaders think the Covid-19 programmes they've got up and running together, are better than those they'd have achieved alone.

"Most ""wet markets"", such as this one selling prawns in Wuhan, do not sell wildlife The Australian government is calling for the G20 countries to take action on wildlife wet markets, calling them a ""biosecurity and human health risk"". Australia is not yet calling for a ban - but says its own advisers believe they may need to be ""phased out"". ""Wet markets"" are marketplaces that sell fresh food such as meat and fish. But some also sell wildlife - and it's thought the coronavirus may have emerged at a wet market in Wuhan that sold live, ""exotic"" animals. The Huanan market in Wuhan reportedly offered a range of animals including foxes, wolf cubs, civets, turtles, and snakes. The Australian government called foran investigation,externalinto wildlife wet markets after a meeting of G20 agriculture ministers. Speaking to the ABC on Thursday,agriculture minister David Littleproud said,externalhe was not targeting all food markets. ""A wet market, like the Sydney fish market, is perfectly safe,"" he said.

"B&Q in Cardiff reopened its doors to the public on Tuesday The government is facing pressure to give businesses ""hope"" after a warning that social distancing could last for the rest of the year. Senior Tory MP Sir Geoffrey Clifton-Brown said it must discuss a return to normality or risk businesses folding. The hospitality industry has warned that maintaining social distancing until next year would be catastrophic. Cabinet minister Brandon Lewis said there was a difficult balance to strike between health and economic concerns. Latest figures showed a further 616 patients with coronavirus have died in the UK, taking the total number of deaths in UK hospitals to 18,738. The Department of Health said that a further 4,583 people had tested positive for Covid-19 since Wednesday.

And Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon hasoutlined ideas for the initial easing of the lockdown. The businesses adapting to life under lockdown What are the social distancing rules? Tory backbenchers want lockdown eased soon Sir Geoffrey, treasurer of the influential 1922 Committee of backbench Conservatives, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that some companies are ""likely to cease trading"" unless they receive ""some form of indication"" of when they can resume business as usual. ""We have to, on behalf of the businesses of this country, begin to give them a little bit of hope as to when we might be able to get back to normality,"" he said. He stressed that the next steps must be carried out ""gradually"". In response, Northern Ireland Secretary Mr Lewis said certain businesses are ""starting to reopen more stores"" with social distancing measures in place. DIY retailer B&Qsaid it would reopen stores with precautions, while housebuilder Taylor Wimpey and carmaker Jaguar Land Rover said they would also restart operations. However, Mr Lewis said ""we don't want to get ahead of ourselves"" and the best way to protect the public and the NHS was to stay at home. ""One of the most damaging things for our economy would be if we came out of lockdown too early,"" he said, adding that this would risk a second peak. Ms Sturgeon told the Scottish government's daily news conference that it was not possible to return immediately to how life was before the virus and that Covid-19 would be a ""fact of life for some time to come"". She unveiled an initial set of proposals for the eventual easing of restrictions in the country, which suggested: some distancing measures will be in place until at least 2021 children must be educated and businesses must reopen - but continuing efforts will be needed to suppress the virus public gatherings will still be banned and pubs will stay closed for the foreseeable future people with symptoms will still have to stay at home and social distancing and hand hygiene will remain important The plan also suggested that testing, contact tracing and isolation of cases will be vital to keeping the virus under control and it might be necessary to re-impose a lockdown with little notice if there is a danger of another spike in infections.

"The DIY store has reopened some outlets amid UK lockdown measures DIY chain B&Q has confirmed it has now reopened 155 of its UK stores as lockdown measures remain in place. After a trial at 14 stores at the weekend, 61 outlets reopened on Wednesday and another 80 on Thursday. B&Q has introduced ""social distancing controls"", such as capping the number of customers in-store. On Thursday, other firms including Jaguar Land Rover, Aston Martin and Taylor Wimpey said they would return to work in May. B&Q had closed its shops since the end of March after the government introduced lockdown measures to try to contain the spread of Covid-19. However, hardware shops were included on the government's list of essential retailers that were allowed to trade under the restrictions and B&Q customers could continue to shop online. Businesses adapting to life under lockdown Social restrictions 'to remain for rest of year' The DIY chain said on Saturday that 14 of its stores would reopen,followed by a further 61 sites announced on Wednesday,external. In the newly re-opened stores, perspex screens will be fitted to checkouts and two-metre floor markers will indicate the distance shoppers should maintain from each other. The announcement also saw complaints that the retailer would be allowed to sell plants at its sites which have garden centres. The Horticultural Trades Association (HTA) recently told the BBCthat millions of plants and shrubs might have to be binned as, unlike hardware firms, garden centres were deemed non-essential. UK manufacturers and housebuilders announced plans on Thursday to kickstart production during the lockdown. Carmaker Jaguar Land Rover said it would resume production gradually at its factory at Solihull and at its engine manufacturing plant in Wolverhampton from 18 May. It will also reopen its facilities in Slovakia and Austria. The company said the restart of other factories, which include Castle Bromwich and Halewood, will be confirmed in due course. Luxury carmaker Aston Martin said it would reopen its St Athan plant on 5 May after it had temporarily suspended all manufacturing operations in the UK at the end of March. Housebuilder Taylor Wimpey also plans to restart work on most of its building sites across England and Wales in May. Its staff will follow new safety guidelines, while subcontractor work will resume the following week. Peter Redfern, Taylor Wimpey's chief executive said: ""In the period while our sites have been closed, trading has inevitably been impacted. However, we are still seeing continued demand for our homes and our sales teams have been selling homes remotely, and digitally, week to week."" He added that the firm's show homes and sales centres would remain closed, most likely until social distancing measures are relaxed. David O'Brien, an equity analyst at Goodbody, added that Taylor Wimpey is ""in a strong position to ramp up activity"". As Spanish authorities have relaxed some lockdown measures, he added, those operations could provide ""helpful lessons"" and highlight ""potential issues ahead of UK site openings which will also stand it in good stead"". Meanwhile, housebuilder Vistry - formerly Bovis Homes - announced construction would resume on most of its ""partnership sites"", which are typically affordable housing projects, from 27 April. The firm added that a ""significant"" number of private housing construction sites would also reopen. William Ryder, equities analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said that ""any return to activity will be welcome"". ""Demand for new houses definitely seems to been reduced by the current uncertainty, but it doesn't seem to be as bad as some had feared. However, it's possible that things will get worse from here if we enter a prolonged recession,"" he said. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself?

"Online retailer Amazon, long accused of killing off bricks-and-mortar book sales, has stunned the industry by donating Â£250,000 to a fund in aid of bookshops hit by coronavirus. The tech giant initially made the donation on a ""low-key"" basis, said the Book Trade Charity. But as speculation grew, the charity revealed that Amazon was the donor. Chief executive David Hicks said he realised some booksellers would find that difficult. He told the BBC that the Book Trade Charity existed to help the entire book industry, from publishers to bookshops. As part of its efforts, it is running a fund to help booksellers facing financial hardship after being forced to close by the pandemic. Mr Hicks said: ""Amazon came to us and said they would like to put some money into our fund, particularly to help at this time and that they would prefer it to be low-key."" As a result, the charity tried to avoid naming Amazon, although the firm had not insisted on anonymity, he said. However, that policy simply led to more questions, especially after trade publication, the Bookseller, ran a story saying a mystery donor had contributed Â£250,000 of the Â£380,000 raised so far. Mr Hicks said he had been ""very pleased"" to accept the donation in the interests of the charity. However, he added that he was ""conscious that that does give a little bit of difficulty to some booksellers"". ""A large part of the trade, particularly on the publishing side, works very closely with Amazon,"" he said. ""But the bookselling side does have rather a more strained relationship."" The news has already aroused some reactions in the book trade, including from the editor of the Bookseller, Philip Jones, who tweeted that it was ""extraordinary"". Allow Twitter content?

"The UK's budget deficit is set to see ""an absolutely colossal increase to a level not seen in peacetime"", the director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies has said. The economic impact of coronavirus was likely to push the deficit to as high as Â£260bn, Paul Johnson told the BBC. He was speaking after latest figures showed that the deficit hit Â£48.7bn in the 2019-20 financial year. But Mr Johnson said those figures were ""the numbers before the storm"". And, separately, one of the Bank of England's top policymakers has warned that the UK faces its worst economic shock in several hundred years. Jan Vlieghe, a member of the BoE's interest-rate setting committee, said that ""early indicators"" suggest the UK was ""experiencing an economic contraction that is faster and deeper than anything we have seen in the past century, or possibly several centuries"". He did, though, say there was ""in principle"" a good chance that the UK would return to its ""pre-virus trajectory once the pandemic is over"". The UK's deficit last year - the gap between the government's income and its expenditure - was Â£9.3bn higher than in the 2018-19 financial year and equivalent to 2.2% of GDP. The Office for National Statistics, which released those figures, said they did not capture the big spending announced by the government to cope with the virus. ""The coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic is expected to have a significant impact on the UK public sector finances,"" it added. ""These effects will arise from both the introduction of public health measures and from new government policies to support businesses and individuals."" The ONS said the full effects of coronavirus on the public finances would become clearer in the coming months. Mr Johnson told the BBC's Today programme that there was still ""a huge amount of uncertainty"" surrounding the economic impact of the virus. However, the government had announced tax cuts and spending increases worth Â£100bn, so the effect was ""likely to dwarf the record that we saw during the financial crisis"". Mr Johnson said the economy was unlikely to recover quickly afterwards and would remain ""smaller than it otherwise would have been"". He added that tax rises and a growing deficit were the likely outcome. ""I would be astonished if in a couple of years the economy was back where it would have been if it [the virus] had never happened,"" he said. Meanwhile, a closely watched survey of UK businesses has indicated that the economic impact has been even worse than feared. The IHS Markit/CIPS flash UK composite purchasing managers' index (PMI), which measures activity in the services and manufacturing sectors, fell to a new record low of 12.9 in April, down from 36 in March. Any reading below 50 indicates contraction. Economists polled by Reuters had expected a figure of 31.4. ""The dire survey readings will inevitably raise questions about the cost of the lockdown and how long current containment measures will last,"" said Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit, adding that the figures pointed to a quarter-on-quarter economic contraction of at least 7%. In another development, the Treasury has announced that it is speeding up its plans to raise money in order to cover the cost of its coronavirus measures. It will now be issuing Â£180bn worth of government bonds, known as gilts, in the May-to-July period, more than originally intended in those months. We already knew the government was likely to have to borrow huge sums of money to support the economy. But now it's not a ""scenario"" from the Office of Budget Responsibility, but concrete reality. This morning, the Debt Management Office, the arm of the Treasury that borrows on international money markets on behalf of the government, announced how much the government is actually planning to borrow. That's Â£45bn in April alone and a further Â£180bn from the start of May to the end of July - a total of Â£225bn in just four months. One reason is the huge cost of programmes such as furloughing, now expected to cost well north of Â£50bn. The other reason is that the government's revenues - the tax it collects through income tax, VAT and national insurance - are collapsing. If you shut down much of the economy, you also turn off the tap on much of the government's tax income. The OBR's scenario was that the government might need to borrow Â£382bn for the year - about seven times what was expected pre-Covid.  That depends, though, on the shutdown being lifted sooner rather than later. The Resolution Foundation estimates that if the shutdown continues for six months, borrowing will be even higher for the year - a truly mind-boggling Â£500bn. That's about a quarter of the size of the entire economy. ""The temporary and immediate nature of the unprecedented support announced for people and businesses means the government expects that a significantly higher proportion of total gilt sales in 2020-21 will take place in the first four months of the financial year, in order to meet the immediate financing needs resulting from Covid-19,"" the Treasury said. ""This higher volume of issuance is not expected to be required across the remainder of the financial year.""

The UK's deficit last year - the gap between the government's income and its expenditure - was Â£9.3bn higher than in the 2018-19 financial year and equivalent to 2.2% of GDP. The Office for National Statistics, which released those figures, said they did not capture the big spending announced by the government to cope with the virus. ""The coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic is expected to have a significant impact on the UK public sector finances,"" it added. ""These effects will arise from both the introduction of public health measures and from new government policies to support businesses and individuals."" The ONS said the full effects of coronavirus on the public finances would become clearer in the coming months. Mr Johnson told the BBC's Today programme that there was still ""a huge amount of uncertainty"" surrounding the economic impact of the virus. However, the government had announced tax cuts and spending increases worth Â£100bn, so the effect was ""likely to dwarf the record that we saw during the financial crisis"". Mr Johnson said the economy was unlikely to recover quickly afterwards and would remain ""smaller than it otherwise would have been"". He added that tax rises and a growing deficit were the likely outcome. ""I would be astonished if in a couple of years the economy was back where it would have been if it [the virus] had never happened,"" he said. Meanwhile, a closely watched survey of UK businesses has indicated that the economic impact has been even worse than feared. The IHS Markit/CIPS flash UK composite purchasing managers' index (PMI), which measures activity in the services and manufacturing sectors, fell to a new record low of 12.9 in April, down from 36 in March. Any reading below 50 indicates contraction. Economists polled by Reuters had expected a figure of 31.4. ""The dire survey readings will inevitably raise questions about the cost of the lockdown and how long current containment measures will last,"" said Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit, adding that the figures pointed to a quarter-on-quarter economic contraction of at least 7%. In another development, the Treasury has announced that it is speeding up its plans to raise money in order to cover the cost of its coronavirus measures. It will now be issuing Â£180bn worth of government bonds, known as gilts, in the May-to-July period, more than originally intended in those months. We already knew the government was likely to have to borrow huge sums of money to support the economy. But now it's not a ""scenario"" from the Office of Budget Responsibility, but concrete reality. This morning, the Debt Management Office, the arm of the Treasury that borrows on international money markets on behalf of the government, announced how much the government is actually planning to borrow. That's Â£45bn in April alone and a further Â£180bn from the start of May to the end of July - a total of Â£225bn in just four months. One reason is the huge cost of programmes such as furloughing, now expected to cost well north of Â£50bn. The other reason is that the government's revenues - the tax it collects through income tax, VAT and national insurance - are collapsing. If you shut down much of the economy, you also turn off the tap on much of the government's tax income. The OBR's scenario was that the government might need to borrow Â£382bn for the year - about seven times what was expected pre-Covid.  That depends, though, on the shutdown being lifted sooner rather than later. The Resolution Foundation estimates that if the shutdown continues for six months, borrowing will be even higher for the year - a truly mind-boggling Â£500bn. That's about a quarter of the size of the entire economy. ""The temporary and immediate nature of the unprecedented support announced for people and businesses means the government expects that a significantly higher proportion of total gilt sales in 2020-21 will take place in the first four months of the financial year, in order to meet the immediate financing needs resulting from Covid-19,"" the Treasury said. ""This higher volume of issuance is not expected to be required across the remainder of the financial year.""

"Chancellor Merkel has been widely praised for her handling of the crisis German Chancellor Angela Merkel has said her country must remain ""clever and cautious"" in handling the coronavirus crisis, as it is ""not the end phase but still just the beginning"". ""We'll have to live with this virus for a long time,"" Ms Merkel told parliament ahead of an EU summit, via videolink. She said Germany should be ready to ""make very different, meaning much higher contributions to the EU budget"". The video summit - the EU's fourth on coronavirus - is now under way. EU leaders are expected to sign off on a new â¬540bn (Â£470bn; $575bn) emergency fund to protect European workers, businesses and countries worst affected by the coronavirus outbreak. The details are yet to be worked out. The â¬540bn would be released through EU institutions that already exist, including the European Stability Mechanism (ESM), the main bailout fund set up in response to the 2008 financial crisis. EU summit chairman Charles Michel videoconferencing with leaders European Council President Charles Michel told leaders,externalthey should aim to start releasing the funds by 1 June. But a thornier issue is how much extra to commit to the EU budget to deal with this crisis, and how much the 27 member states will spend jointly. There are plans for a special recovery fund, like the post-1945 Marshall Plan. Italy and some other states want EU help in aid grants, not loans. The scale of the crisis is such, they argue, that at least â¬1.5 trillion will be needed. Mrs Merkel said extra EU budget funds should be provided ""in a spirit of solidarity"" and for a limited time. Germany has brought the infection rate down considerably Italy, at the epicentre of the pandemic in Europe, has been especially vocal in urging its EU partners to jointly guarantee debt. But Germany, the Netherlands and Austria oppose any mutualisation of debt, in the form of so-called ""coronabonds"". Under current EU rules countries cannot be made liable for each other's debts. The old rifts from the eurozone crisis of 2009 - a supposedly frugal northern Europe versus a spendthrift south - have re-emerged with this outbreak. The view from Rome is that a shared crisis needs a shared solution. Facing fierce opposition mainly from Germany and the Netherlands, Italy may no longer be wedded to its idea of ""coronabonds"" - debt mutualisation - but is still pushing for a financial package that does not penalise any single economy. That, after all, is the spirit of the common market that Italy helped create. Many Italians feel abandoned by an EU that has hoarded protective equipment and closed borders. Polls show anti-EU feeling is at its highest ever here. The leader of the hard-right Brothers of Italy party, Giorgia Meloni, told me the EU had shown its inadequacy and distance from the solidarity its members craved, peddling the idea of Italy as a beggar, wasting its money. ""The EU exists thanks to Italy,"" she said. ""But it's now a system that favours others."" Hers is the party steadily rising in the polls. Why fractious EU still believes together is better Face masks to be compulsory across Germany What can the UK learn from Germany on testing? French President Emmanuel Macron has sided with Italy and Spain in this crisis, warning that it threatens the very existence of the EU. Italy, Spain and France - in that order - have the highest European death tolls from Covid-19, each above 20,000. On Thursday German officials said coronavirus cases nationally had risen to 148,046, and the number of deaths linked to Covid-19 had risen by 215 to 5,094. Mrs Merkel said ""it's the biggest challenge since World War Two, for the life and health of our people"". A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? AVOIDING CONTACT:The rules on self-isolation and exercise HOPE AND LOSS:Your coronavirus stories VIDEO:The 20-second hand wash STRESS:How to look after your mental health She urged ""maximum discipline"", to avoid stop-start lockdowns. ""We must not waste what has been achieved already,"" she said, praising the efficiency of Germany's healthcare system and the armed forces' role. ""The question of how we can prevent the virus from overwhelming our health system and subsequently costing the lives of countless people, this question will for a long time be the central question for politics in Germany and Europe."" This video can not be played 'Make no mistake, we remain in very turbulent water' - WHO's Dr Hans Kluge The World Health Organization (WHO) says care home residents account for up to half of Covid-19 deaths in Europe, which is ""a deeply concerning picture"". Mrs Merkel said Europe must strengthen its capacity to produce specialised medical kit, instead of depending on global supplies, which are now very stretched. She also called the WHO an indispensable partner in the fight against the virus. President Donald Trump has suspended US funding of the body. ""I know how difficult the restrictions are, it's a challenge to democracy, it limits our democratic rights,"" she said, adding that democratic transparency, such as a free press, helped to make the situation tolerable. ""It's amazing how much understanding people have shown for each other,"" she said. MPs frequently applauded her.

"EU leaders will meet by video for their summit on Thursday ""EU in disarray!"" scream headlines since the start of the Covid-19 pandemic. Brussels is depicted as ""weak""; EU member states as ""feuding"". You find endless analyses online focusing on the ""lack of solidarity"" shown by the rich EU North: Germany, the Netherlands, Austria, Finland - the ""frugals"" as they've been dubbed - towards the suffering South - i.e. Italy and Spain. In the UK, the EU's handling of coronavirus feeds into what's left of the Brexit debate. The UK has already left the EU, of course, but Remainer/Leaver resentments linger. And the question of how close the UK remains to Brussels in the future is not yet enshrined in law. Does EU behaviour during the pandemic mean we were right to leave or wrong? Twitter is not exactly short of thoughts on that subject. But are media depictions of the EU and its members so far during this crisis entirely accurate? ""Are they ever?"" huffed a key Brussels figure when I asked him. ""We've had ugly moments but by now the achievements are stacking up. The massive ECB (European Central Bank) stimulus package was just the beginning. Thursday is a big day."" EU leaders meet by video-conference for a summit on Thursday afternoon. They're expected to sign off on a new â¬540bn (Â£470bn; $575bn) emergency fund to protect European workers, businesses and countries worst affected by the coronavirus outbreak. The Italian prime minister needs to show he is being listened to in Brussels The fund was difficult to agree between member states but they got there in the end. After considerable push and pull, plus a dramatic intervention by French President Emmanuel Macron, who threatened the end of the EU if agreement wasn't found. ""So much for us failing to show solidarity with Italy,"" snorted a Dutch colleague to me. ""It's a generous package."" Are EU divisions banished after the coronavirus deal? Tailor-made lockdown easing for European countries What is the EU equipment row all about? Financial crisis 'on steroids' facing EU leaders Angela Merkel's preferred wording was that solidarity had been shown towards Italy and the South. It would continue to be shown in the future, she said. Brussels boasts that, in addition to the fund, EU members have been sharing protective medical equipment and specialist medical teams with one another. The German military has airlifted coronavirus patients from the heart of Italy's pandemic for treatment in Germany In some cases, they've also been treating each other's patients. According to German newspaper SÃ¼ddeutsche Zeitung, the cost of providing treatment to patients coming from abroad has cost the German taxpayer â¬20m so far. On Thursday, EU leaders are also expected to approve common measures for gradually lifting coronavirus restrictions. This does not mean coordinating an EU-wide End of Lockdown. Each country has its own health service, with different infection patterns, different lockdown measures in place. Would the spread of coronavirus have been more easily contained if all EU countries and their neighbours had taken early and uniform precautions? Indubitably, say medical experts. But that kind of agreed action hasn't been possible amongst the states of the United States of America. It was never going to happen between 27 independent EU countries, with their varying forms of government (federal, regional etc). Brussels admits every member state will now ""tailor-make"" their exit strategy from lockdown but it wants them to at least inform one other in advance, to avoid complications for people working across national borders. The Commission has also asked that no EU country lift its Covid-19 restrictions unless: The number of deaths/infections in that country has been reducing and stable for a sustained period of time The national health service could cope with a surge of new infections if necessary The EU country in question has enough testing capacity to identify and quarantine new infections plus people they have recently been in contact with, in order to keep those who have not yet had the virus safe. EU leaders are broadly in agreement with all of this, but smiles could turn to gritted teeth when they then turn their attention to the future. One of the summit priorities on Thursday is to discuss a Recovery Plan for Europe: aimed at getting European economies back on their feet after the health crisis is over. The kind of figure that's being discussed is around â¬1-1.5 trillion. This video can not be played Italyâs lockdown puts restaurants out of business The main recipients would be European countries with the weakest economies. France's President Macron wants the programme to be time-limited to about five years. He hopes it will be ""oven-ready"", signed off by parliaments across the EU, by the end of the year. But where the plan is still vague and contested is what form funds should take: loans or grants? Should the money be raised as part of the next EU budget (which needs to be decided by the December) or alongside? As always, national politics is key. The German chancellor will leave office in 2021 Apart from Germany's Angela Merkel - who will not want the EU to fall apart in her last term in office - the big players in this debate are all vying to be re-elected. They're keen to prove their credentials to a domestic audience. With an eye on Eurosceptic politicians at home, the Dutch prime minister wants to be seen to be protecting Dutch taxpayers' money on the European stage. Italy's prime minister also needs to show he's sticking up for his country in Brussels. Italy was one of the EU's most Eurosceptic nations even before the coronavirus crisis. And France? Emmanuel Macron is always looking over his shoulder at arch-Eurosceptic and political rival Marine Le Pen. He's trying to weave a delicate dance between giving the French the impression that he's leading the post-virus recovery charge in Europe, while trying to get extra cash for the countries of the Mediterranean (including France), yet trying hard not to alienate Berlin, which he hopes will foot the largest chunk of the bill. Quite the juggling act. The French (and Italian and Spanish) argument is now refocused, not on solidarity but self-interest. Their message to the frugal North: we all benefit from the single market. It's worth spending a bit more in the wake of the Covid-19 crisis to rebalance inequalities between members to make the market more competitive and lucrative in the long term. Otherwise you risk the market faltering altogether. President Macron wants the EU's Recovery Plan signed off this year and limited to five years This message dovetails with the ambitions of the still relatively new presidents of the European Commission and the European Council. They believe coronavirus has made the failings in the way China and the US function glaringly obvious. They hope that will make way for a reborn and rebooted EU to play a bigger role on the world stage - economically, in terms of a Green revolution, and digitally - after the crisis is over. This, anyway, is the cherished dream in Brussels right now. And as part of such a long wishlist, the details of the post-health crisis Recovery Fund are unlikely to be agreed anytime soon. Following their Thursday summit, EU leaders will ask the European Commission to come up with concrete proposals but insiders say the painful process of compromise over the fund and the new EU budget is only likely to happen when leaders sit together in person. And who knows when that will next be? In the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis, there were calls all over the EU to leave the bloc. This time it's different. Eurosceptic politicians haven't gone away. Plenty of voters are still critical of Brussels. But the call to leave the EU altogether has broadly fallen silent. EU relations are messy and further complicated by national politics but most EU leaders think the Covid-19 programmes they've got up and running together, are better than those they'd have achieved alone.

"Most ""wet markets"", such as this one selling prawns in Wuhan, do not sell wildlife The Australian government is calling for the G20 countries to take action on wildlife wet markets, calling them a ""biosecurity and human health risk"". Australia is not yet calling for a ban - but says its own advisers believe they may need to be ""phased out"". ""Wet markets"" are marketplaces that sell fresh food such as meat and fish. But some also sell wildlife - and it's thought the coronavirus may have emerged at a wet market in Wuhan that sold live, ""exotic"" animals. The Huanan market in Wuhan reportedly offered a range of animals including foxes, wolf cubs, civets, turtles, and snakes. The Australian government called foran investigation,externalinto wildlife wet markets after a meeting of G20 agriculture ministers. Speaking to the ABC on Thursday,agriculture minister David Littleproud said,externalhe was not targeting all food markets. ""A wet market, like the Sydney fish market, is perfectly safe,"" he said.

"A police officer hands out unemployment benefit applications in a car park in Florida A further 4.4 million Americans sought unemployment benefits last week as the economic toll from the coronavirus pandemic continued to mount. The new applications brought the total number of jobless claims since mid-March to 26.4 million. That amounts to more than 15% of the US workforce. However, the most recent data marked the third week that the number of new claims has declined, raising hopes that the worst of the shock may be over. ""While this week's 4.4 million jobless claims are staggering, there are signs that the pace of layoffs has reached its peak,"" said Richard Flynn, UK managing director at financial service firm Charles Schwab. ""The key questions at this point are when can the economy reopen and what happens when it does?"" Economists have warned that the world is facing the sharpest slowdown since the Great Depression in the 1930s. In the US, the economy is expected to contract 5.9% this year, according to the International Monetary Fund. In just five weeks, the surge in unemployment claims has exceeded the number of jobs created in the near-decade of expansion that ended in February. A Pew Research Center survey estimates that 43% of households have been hit by a coronavirus-related job loss or pay cut, a share that rises to more than half among adults with lower-incomes. The US government has responded to the crisis with more than $2 trillion in relief, expanding eligibility for unemployment benefits and increased the payments, among other measures. A record 16 million Americans received the benefits in the week ended 11 April, the Labor Department said.But many people have had trouble getting through to state offices processing the applications. The stories behind America's unemployed 'What I fear the most is not being able to survive' ""The phones lines are often busy,"" said John Dignan, a 52-year-old real estate agent in Nevada. ""It's very frustrating because you have no control and no information. You already have so much anxiety about Covid-19, you know the economy's falling apart and I don't have much left in savings - maybe about a month left."" A $349bn relief programme for small businesses, part of the $2tn rescue legislation, ran out of funds within two weeks. While Congress is expected to approve an additional $310bn this week, the programme, which offers low-cost loans that do not need to be repaid if the recipient meets certain conditions, has been attacked for not reaching the smallest firms. ""We're just waiting,"" said New York restaurant-owner Larry Hyland, who applied the first day that banks started accepting applications on behalf of his Brooklyn-based beer garden, Greenwood Park. Reviews have found that roughly two-thirds of the money so far has gone to large publicly listed companies rather than mom-and-pop shops. Firms with pre-existing relationships with banks - typically larger businesses - were at an advantage. This video can not be played Coronavirus: Millions of Americans unemployed On Thursday, the administration responded to the criticism with new guidelines for the loan programme aimed at screening out big firms. But Mr Hyland said that even if he does get the money it may not help, since it is supposed to be spent primarily on wages within eight weeks - and he remains closed. ""The timeline is the biggest issue,"" he said. ""Not knowing when you can actually reopen and to what capacity you can reopen, how can we take on the burden of that loan?"" US President Donald Trump, who is up for re-election in November, has pushed to loosen restrictions on activity, despite fears that testing and other safety measures remain insufficient. Some states have already started to relax rules, while protests against lockdown orders have arisen elsewhere. Even if jobless claims continue to subside as reopening gets underway, analysts say the scars on America's consumer-driven economy will linger.

"Telecoms engineers have told Radio 1 Newsbeat they're being threatened and harassed by people who believe they're working on 5G, which has been wrongly linked to coronavirus. Claims about any link have been brandedcomplete rubbishby scientists. But the union and trade body representing thousands of workers across the UK say they've had around 120 cases of abuse reported to them. The reports have included threats of extreme violence. ""We've actually had cases where people have been threatened with being stabbed, threatened with physical violence and in some cases actually threatened with murder,"" says Andy Kerr, deputy general secretary of the Communication Workers Union (CWU). CWU represents nearly 40,000 telecoms engineers. Andy says most aren't even working on 5G - they're maintaining the network and playing ""a crucial role"". ""People are stuck at home - whether they want to watch their box set of Peaky Blinders or somebody's isolated and they want to keep in touch with family.

"The carrier had been due to sail from Portsmouth on Tuesday A planned sailing of the aircraft carrier HMS Queen Elizabeth has been postponed while crew members are tested for coronavirus. The carrier had been due to sail from Portsmouth on Tuesday for a period of sea training with 800 crew onboard. The navy had initially planned for it to sail without any of the crew being tested beforehand. However, in the last 24 hours it reversed the decision saying there was extra capacity in testing. On Wednesday, Defence Secretary Ben Wallace was asked by MPs about the plans to allow the carrier to go to sea given recent Covid-19 outbreaks on a number of US carriers and the French navy's Charles de Gaulle. Mr Wallace told MPs that he had given the captain of HMS Queen Elizabeth full authority to return to port if there was an outbreak and it was deemed necessary. The 65,000-tonne carrier HMS Queen Elizabeth is the largest warship ever to be built in Britain However, the navy has since announced there would be a ""short but manageable delay in sailing"" until at least Thursday. A navy spokesman said: ""In addition to an isolation period at sea, the Royal Navy is now making use of spare NHS testing capacity to test the crew of HMS Queen Elizabeth prior to sailing. ""This is the right and sensible thing to do to ensure the Navy can continue to deliver on operations now and in the future. ""She will be operating in waters close to the UK coast and the commanding officer has the discretion to cease the training, if deemed necessary.""

"A police officer hands out unemployment benefit applications in a car park in Florida A further 4.4 million Americans sought unemployment benefits last week as the economic toll from the coronavirus pandemic continued to mount. The new applications brought the total number of jobless claims since mid-March to 26.4 million. That amounts to more than 15% of the US workforce. However, the most recent data marked the third week that the number of new claims has declined, raising hopes that the worst of the shock may be over. ""While this week's 4.4 million jobless claims are staggering, there are signs that the pace of layoffs has reached its peak,"" said Richard Flynn, UK managing director at financial service firm Charles Schwab. ""The key questions at this point are when can the economy reopen and what happens when it does?"" Economists have warned that the world is facing the sharpest slowdown since the Great Depression in the 1930s. In the US, the economy is expected to contract 5.9% this year, according to the International Monetary Fund. In just five weeks, the surge in unemployment claims has exceeded the number of jobs created in the near-decade of expansion that ended in February. A Pew Research Center survey estimates that 43% of households have been hit by a coronavirus-related job loss or pay cut, a share that rises to more than half among adults with lower-incomes. The US government has responded to the crisis with more than $2 trillion in relief, expanding eligibility for unemployment benefits and increased the payments, among other measures. A record 16 million Americans received the benefits in the week ended 11 April, the Labor Department said.But many people have had trouble getting through to state offices processing the applications. The stories behind America's unemployed 'What I fear the most is not being able to survive' ""The phones lines are often busy,"" said John Dignan, a 52-year-old real estate agent in Nevada. ""It's very frustrating because you have no control and no information. You already have so much anxiety about Covid-19, you know the economy's falling apart and I don't have much left in savings - maybe about a month left."" A $349bn relief programme for small businesses, part of the $2tn rescue legislation, ran out of funds within two weeks. While Congress is expected to approve an additional $310bn this week, the programme, which offers low-cost loans that do not need to be repaid if the recipient meets certain conditions, has been attacked for not reaching the smallest firms. ""We're just waiting,"" said New York restaurant-owner Larry Hyland, who applied the first day that banks started accepting applications on behalf of his Brooklyn-based beer garden, Greenwood Park. Reviews have found that roughly two-thirds of the money so far has gone to large publicly listed companies rather than mom-and-pop shops. Firms with pre-existing relationships with banks - typically larger businesses - were at an advantage. This video can not be played Coronavirus: Millions of Americans unemployed On Thursday, the administration responded to the criticism with new guidelines for the loan programme aimed at screening out big firms. But Mr Hyland said that even if he does get the money it may not help, since it is supposed to be spent primarily on wages within eight weeks - and he remains closed. ""The timeline is the biggest issue,"" he said. ""Not knowing when you can actually reopen and to what capacity you can reopen, how can we take on the burden of that loan?"" US President Donald Trump, who is up for re-election in November, has pushed to loosen restrictions on activity, despite fears that testing and other safety measures remain insufficient. Some states have already started to relax rules, while protests against lockdown orders have arisen elsewhere. Even if jobless claims continue to subside as reopening gets underway, analysts say the scars on America's consumer-driven economy will linger. ""The damage"" said Paul Ashworth, chief US economist at Capital Economics, ""has already been done.""

Some of the main developments today:  Today's live page was written by our journalists in Australia, Singapore, India, the UK and US: Anna Jones, Yvette Tan, Andreas Illmer, Krutika Pathi, Frances Mao, Kelly-Leigh Cooper, Alexandra Fouche, Rebecca Morton, Dulcie Lee, Saj Chowdhury, Michael Emons,  Emlyn Begley, Marie Jackson, Rob Greenall, Lucy Webster, Paul Seddon, Yaroslav Lukov, Holly Hondereich, Ritu Prasad, Ian Youngs, Helier Cheung and Jude Sheerin. Anthony ZurcherBBC North America reporter The harsh political reality for the president is he faces a re-election contest in just over six months, and the longer the lockdown drags on, the less time the economy will have to recover before voters head to the ballot box. Current polling suggests he is trailing presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden nationally and in key battleground states, and while the race is likely to tighten and the president has abundant resources to run a robust campaign, Trump appears destined for an uphill fight. The president also faces a flip-side risk of being seen as supporting re-opening too quickly and shouldering the blame if there is a subsequent spike in cases. That could explain why, just days after calling for states to begin reopening process, he criticised the Republican governor of Georgia for lifting restrictions on places like hair salons, bars and tattoo parlours, where social distancing guidelines would be difficult to follow. It's a difficult line for any politician to walk, and in the days ahead the stakes will be at their highest. Here's Anthony's full piece:Coronavirus pandemic exposes rather than heals America's divisions Trump was also asked how the November presidential election could go ahead amid the coronavirus outbreak. ""I can't tell you what's going to happen in an election,"" Trump says. ""We have a sleepy guy in a basement of a house that the press is giving a free pass to, who doesn't want to do debates because of Covid,"" he says of former Vice-President Joe Biden, his likely Democratic challenger, whom he often calls ""Sleepy Joe"". ""I watched a couple of interviews, and I say 'Oh I look forward to this,'"" Trump says. ""But they're keeping him sheltered."" Biden cancelled all in-person campaign events beginning in mid-March as social-distancing measures were ordered throughout the US. He has continued to hold interviews and digital fundraisers from his home in Delaware, and launched a podcast last month. In an interview today, Biden said he was ""ready to debate"" Trump. ""Zoom or Skype or Slack or hangouts or in person, anytime, anywhere he wants."" The US president also claimed knowledge in the fields of medicine and economics during the news conference. ""I'm not a doctor but I'm a person who has a good you-know-what,"" he said at one point, apparently gesturing to his brain. At another point: ""I know a lot about economists and the answer is they have no idea. I think I have as good of an idea as anybody."" Captain Tom Moore, the 99-year-old British Army veteran who has raised Â£28.5m ($35m) for the NHS, could be number one in the UK music charts this weekend - but he's in a tight race with a Canadian pop star. A version of You'll Never Walk Alone featuring the voice of Captain Tom was thought to be on course to be number one, but earlier on Thursday, The Weeknd's Blinding Lights overtook him. However, in a late twist, The Weeknd has now thrown his weight behind Captain Tom. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The briefing is now over but to recap, Trump launched an extraordinary attack on his ally, Georgia Governor Brian Kemp, over his aggressive reopening plan for his state. ""I want the states to open, more than he does, much more than he does,"" Trump says of Kemp. ""But I didn't like to see spas [reopening] at this early stage, nor did the doctors."" Kemp said hair salons, gyms, bowling alleys and nail salons would be allowed to reopen on Friday, with restaurants following suit on Monday. ""I didn't like to see a lot of things happening, and I wasn't happy with it, and I wasn't happy with Brian Kemp,"" Trump says. ""I could have done something about it if I wanted to, but I'm saying, 'Let the governors do it.'"" The BBC's Jon Sopel asks Trump how British Prime Minister Boris Johnson was when he spoke to him this week. ""He called me a few days ago, I will tell you he sounded incredible. I was actually surprisedâ¦ he was ready to go, Iâm very surprised to tell you this, itâs like, the old Boris, tremendous energy, tremendous drive."" He adds: ""Because he called me almost pretty close to when he got out of the hospital, I think heâs doing great, he was so sharp and energetic, pretty incredible, heâs an incredible guy, heâs a friend of ours and a friend of mine, he loves our country, he loves his country a lotâ¦ and theyâre lucky to have him over there."" Trump is asked about the new guidance suggesting the virus is vulnerable to heat and humidity, particularly given that countries with hot weather, like Singapore, have also been hit by the outbreak. ""I hope people enjoy the sun,"" Trump says. ""And if it has an impact that's great.... maybe you can, maybe you can't. I'm not a doctor"" He then asks Dr Deborah Birx, a co-ordinator of the White House virus response whether heat can help kill the virus. ""Deborah have you ever heard of that? The heat, and the light relative to certain viruses, yes, but to this virus?"" ""Not as a treatment,"" Dr Birx says. ""I mean, certainly, fever, is a good thing. When you have a fever it helps your body respond."" But she does not believe it works as a treatment, she repeats. Katya AdlerEurope Editor Very
aware of the negative headlines of late, depicting EU leader v EU leader; the
rich and frugal North v the suffering, spendthrift South, there was a
determination at Thursdayâs EU summit to avoid the verbal fisticuffs. There was no
walkout by ""Angry Italy"". No fuming about Eurobonds by the Dutch. Instead EU
leaders signed off, as expected, on a pre-agreed â¬500bn ($540bn; Â£435bn) emergency
financial package and on guidelines for lifting Covid-19 restrictions. Heated
discussion about a recovery plan for European economies after the health
crisis was left for another day - the buck passed to the European Commission
which now has the unenviable task of conjuring up a proposal  acceptable
to divided EU opinion. Today at least, EU leaders were keen to present a united
front. Their underlying intended message: âYes, we argue but EU solidarity
exists. We muddle our way through in the end.â Trump is asked why he has stopped promoting hydroxychloroquine, a malaria and lupus medication, as a possible treatment for coronavirus. âI havenât at all... weâll see what happens,â he says. The president's public remarks hyping the drug have decreased substantially over the past week or so. He says today he hasnât seen a recent study that said coronavirus patients taking hydroxychloroquine had higher death rates. That research followed 368 patients at US Veterans Health Administration medical centres. The 97 patients who took hydroxychloroquine had a 27.8% death rate. The 158 patients who did not take the drug had an 11.4% death rate. The BBC's Jon Sopel asks a question about the new guidance suggesting the virus is vulnerable to heat and humidity. ""At the moment the advice is stay at home, by the summer could we be flipping that, and saying you'll be much better off being outside?"" Sopel asks.

Helier CheungBBC News, Washington DC More than 26 million Americans have filed for unemployment in the past five weeks - over 15% of the US workforce. One American who has lost her job recently is Rachel Sterner, who worked as a stage manager for the Broadway production of Harry Potter and the Cursed Child. She says: ""I loved my job - it was my responsibility to maintain the artistic integrity of the show, and it's a challenging and beautiful show. ""Working in theatre means being laid off is not a foreign concept - but normally, if you lose a job, you can get on another project. This is different - there won't be work for a long time. ""Even if we do a show at half-capacity, who knows how long it'll be till tourists come back, and people have disposable income for the theatre?""

Meanwhile, the US House of Representatives has voted 388-5 to pass a $484bn (Â£390bn) emergency aid bill meant to replenish depleted relief programs for small businesses. The bill, passed by the Senate earlier this week, will also provide funding for hospitals and coronavirus testing. It will not provide money to state governments. Lawmakers donned face masks and maintained social distancing as they assembled in the Capitol today. To vote, members were divided alphabetically into groups of roughly 60 people and were asked to stay in their offices until their group was called. Vice-President Mike Pence says that 4.93 million coronavirus tests have been completed across the US, adding that commercial labs surpassed 100,000 tests yesterday. Pence says that he is ""encouraged"" by states' ""phased approach"" to reopening their economies. ""We're slowing the spread, we're protecting the most vulnerable, we're saving lives and every single day we are one day closer to opening up America again,"" Pence says. Taking the stage after Donald Trump, Vice-President Mike Pence says the data continues to show ""promising signs of progress"" in the US fight against coronavirus. Major virus hotspots including the New York Metro Area, New Jersey, Connecticut, Detroit and New Orleans ""all appear to be past their peak"", Pence says. ""Our only conclusion is that we're getting there, America,"" he adds. ""If we continue these mitigation efforts in the days ahead... we do believe by early summer we could be in a much better place as a nation, with much of this coronavirus epidemic behind us.""

a statement, McDaniel's wife of more than 30 years, Lisa McDaniel, wrote that
the livestream would be cancelled as ""John's story, along with early
assumptions that he stated on Twitter and Facebook had turned into national
news"". ""This
news has opened flood gates for people to share their own misguided anger and
unfounded assumptions about a man they don't know."" McDaniel's
posts disparaged stay home mandates ordered by Ohio Governor Mike DeWine, and
called the virus response ""madness"". ""As

""We have a lot of great, brilliant minds working on this,"" he says. ""Unfortunately we're not very close to testing because when testing starts it takes a period of time, but we'll get it done."" Dr Anthony Fauci, the US government's top infectious diseases expert, has previously said that a vaccine will likely take 12-18 months to be approved for widespread use. Most health experts also agree that it would take at least 12-18 months before a vaccine is ready.

Some of the main developments today:  Today's live page was written by our journalists in Australia, Singapore, India, the UK and US: Anna Jones, Yvette Tan, Andreas Illmer, Krutika Pathi, Frances Mao, Kelly-Leigh Cooper, Alexandra Fouche, Rebecca Morton, Dulcie Lee, Saj Chowdhury, Michael Emons,  Emlyn Begley, Marie Jackson, Rob Greenall, Lucy Webster, Paul Seddon, Yaroslav Lukov, Holly Hondereich, Ritu Prasad, Ian Youngs, Helier Cheung and Jude Sheerin. Anthony ZurcherBBC North America reporter The harsh political reality for the president is he faces a re-election contest in just over six months, and the longer the lockdown drags on, the less time the economy will have to recover before voters head to the ballot box. Current polling suggests he is trailing presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden nationally and in key battleground states, and while the race is likely to tighten and the president has abundant resources to run a robust campaign, Trump appears destined for an uphill fight. The president also faces a flip-side risk of being seen as supporting re-opening too quickly and shouldering the blame if there is a subsequent spike in cases. That could explain why, just days after calling for states to begin reopening process, he criticised the Republican governor of Georgia for lifting restrictions on places like hair salons, bars and tattoo parlours, where social distancing guidelines would be difficult to follow. It's a difficult line for any politician to walk, and in the days ahead the stakes will be at their highest. Here's Anthony's full piece:Coronavirus pandemic exposes rather than heals America's divisions Trump was also asked how the November presidential election could go ahead amid the coronavirus outbreak. ""I can't tell you what's going to happen in an election,"" Trump says. ""We have a sleepy guy in a basement of a house that the press is giving a free pass to, who doesn't want to do debates because of Covid,"" he says of former Vice-President Joe Biden, his likely Democratic challenger, whom he often calls ""Sleepy Joe"". ""I watched a couple of interviews, and I say 'Oh I look forward to this,'"" Trump says. ""But they're keeping him sheltered."" Biden cancelled all in-person campaign events beginning in mid-March as social-distancing measures were ordered throughout the US. He has continued to hold interviews and digital fundraisers from his home in Delaware, and launched a podcast last month. In an interview today, Biden said he was ""ready to debate"" Trump. ""Zoom or Skype or Slack or hangouts or in person, anytime, anywhere he wants."" The US president also claimed knowledge in the fields of medicine and economics during the news conference. ""I'm not a doctor but I'm a person who has a good you-know-what,"" he said at one point, apparently gesturing to his brain. At another point: ""I know a lot about economists and the answer is they have no idea. I think I have as good of an idea as anybody."" Captain Tom Moore, the 99-year-old British Army veteran who has raised Â£28.5m ($35m) for the NHS, could be number one in the UK music charts this weekend - but he's in a tight race with a Canadian pop star.

The number one will be revealed just before 18:00 BST on Friday. The briefing is now over but to recap, Trump launched an extraordinary attack on his ally, Georgia Governor Brian Kemp, over his aggressive reopening plan for his state. ""I want the states to open, more than he does, much more than he does,"" Trump says of Kemp. ""But I didn't like to see spas [reopening] at this early stage, nor did the doctors."" Kemp said hair salons, gyms, bowling alleys and nail salons would be allowed to reopen on Friday, with restaurants following suit on Monday. ""I didn't like to see a lot of things happening, and I wasn't happy with it, and I wasn't happy with Brian Kemp,"" Trump says. ""I could have done something about it if I wanted to, but I'm saying, 'Let the governors do it.'"" The BBC's Jon Sopel asks Trump how British Prime Minister Boris Johnson was when he spoke to him this week. ""He called me a few days ago, I will tell you he sounded incredible. I was actually surprisedâ¦ he was ready to go, Iâm very surprised to tell you this, itâs like, the old Boris, tremendous energy, tremendous drive."" He adds: ""Because he called me almost pretty close to when he got out of the hospital, I think heâs doing great, he was so sharp and energetic, pretty incredible, heâs an incredible guy, heâs a friend of ours and a friend of mine, he loves our country, he loves his country a lotâ¦ and theyâre lucky to have him over there."" Trump is asked about the new guidance suggesting the virus is vulnerable to heat and humidity, particularly given that countries with hot weather, like Singapore, have also been hit by the outbreak. ""I hope people enjoy the sun,"" Trump says. ""And if it has an impact that's great.... maybe you can, maybe you can't. I'm not a doctor"" He then asks Dr Deborah Birx, a co-ordinator of the White House virus response whether heat can help kill the virus. ""Deborah have you ever heard of that? The heat, and the light relative to certain viruses, yes, but to this virus?"" ""Not as a treatment,"" Dr Birx says. ""I mean, certainly, fever, is a good thing. When you have a fever it helps your body respond."" But she does not believe it works as a treatment, she repeats. Katya AdlerEurope Editor Very
aware of the negative headlines of late, depicting EU leader v EU leader; the
rich and frugal North v the suffering, spendthrift South, there was a
determination at Thursdayâs EU summit to avoid the verbal fisticuffs. There was no
walkout by ""Angry Italy"". No fuming about Eurobonds by the Dutch. Instead EU
leaders signed off, as expected, on a pre-agreed â¬500bn ($540bn; Â£435bn) emergency
financial package and on guidelines for lifting Covid-19 restrictions. Heated
discussion about a recovery plan for European economies after the health
crisis was left for another day - the buck passed to the European Commission
which now has the unenviable task of conjuring up a proposal  acceptable
to divided EU opinion. Today at least, EU leaders were keen to present a united
front. Their underlying intended message: âYes, we argue but EU solidarity
exists. We muddle our way through in the end.â Trump is asked why he has stopped promoting hydroxychloroquine, a malaria and lupus medication, as a possible treatment for coronavirus. âI havenât at all... weâll see what happens,â he says. The president's public remarks hyping the drug have decreased substantially over the past week or so. He says today he hasnât seen a recent study that said coronavirus patients taking hydroxychloroquine had higher death rates. That research followed 368 patients at US Veterans Health Administration medical centres. The 97 patients who took hydroxychloroquine had a 27.8% death rate. The 158 patients who did not take the drug had an 11.4% death rate. The BBC's Jon Sopel asks a question about the new guidance suggesting the virus is vulnerable to heat and humidity. ""At the moment the advice is stay at home, by the summer could we be flipping that, and saying you'll be much better off being outside?"" Sopel asks. ""I would not go contrary to the guidance that has been issued right now,"" Bryan says.

"The UK's budget deficit is set to see ""an absolutely colossal increase to a level not seen in peacetime"", the director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies has said. The economic impact of coronavirus was likely to push the deficit to as high as Â£260bn, Paul Johnson told the BBC. He was speaking after latest figures showed that the deficit hit Â£48.7bn in the 2019-20 financial year. But Mr Johnson said those figures were ""the numbers before the storm"". And, separately, one of the Bank of England's top policymakers has warned that the UK faces its worst economic shock in several hundred years. Jan Vlieghe, a member of the BoE's interest-rate setting committee, said that ""early indicators"" suggest the UK was ""experiencing an economic contraction that is faster and deeper than anything we have seen in the past century, or possibly several centuries"". He did, though, say there was ""in principle"" a good chance that the UK would return to its ""pre-virus trajectory once the pandemic is over"". The UK's deficit last year - the gap between the government's income and its expenditure - was Â£9.3bn higher than in the 2018-19 financial year and equivalent to 2.2% of GDP. The Office for National Statistics, which released those figures, said they did not capture the big spending announced by the government to cope with the virus. ""The coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic is expected to have a significant impact on the UK public sector finances,"" it added. ""These effects will arise from both the introduction of public health measures and from new government policies to support businesses and individuals."" The ONS said the full effects of coronavirus on the public finances would become clearer in the coming months. Mr Johnson told the BBC's Today programme that there was still ""a huge amount of uncertainty"" surrounding the economic impact of the virus. However, the government had announced tax cuts and spending increases worth Â£100bn, so the effect was ""likely to dwarf the record that we saw during the financial crisis"". Mr Johnson said the economy was unlikely to recover quickly afterwards and would remain ""smaller than it otherwise would have been"". He added that tax rises and a growing deficit were the likely outcome. ""I would be astonished if in a couple of years the economy was back where it would have been if it [the virus] had never happened,"" he said. Meanwhile, a closely watched survey of UK businesses has indicated that the economic impact has been even worse than feared. The IHS Markit/CIPS flash UK composite purchasing managers' index (PMI), which measures activity in the services and manufacturing sectors, fell to a new record low of 12.9 in April, down from 36 in March. Any reading below 50 indicates contraction. Economists polled by Reuters had expected a figure of 31.4. ""The dire survey readings will inevitably raise questions about the cost of the lockdown and how long current containment measures will last,"" said Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit, adding that the figures pointed to a quarter-on-quarter economic contraction of at least 7%. In another development, the Treasury has announced that it is speeding up its plans to raise money in order to cover the cost of its coronavirus measures. It will now be issuing Â£180bn worth of government bonds, known as gilts, in the May-to-July period, more than originally intended in those months. We already knew the government was likely to have to borrow huge sums of money to support the economy. But now it's not a ""scenario"" from the Office of Budget Responsibility, but concrete reality. This morning, the Debt Management Office, the arm of the Treasury that borrows on international money markets on behalf of the government, announced how much the government is actually planning to borrow. That's Â£45bn in April alone and a further Â£180bn from the start of May to the end of July - a total of Â£225bn in just four months. One reason is the huge cost of programmes such as furloughing, now expected to cost well north of Â£50bn. The other reason is that the government's revenues - the tax it collects through income tax, VAT and national insurance - are collapsing. If you shut down much of the economy, you also turn off the tap on much of the government's tax income. The OBR's scenario was that the government might need to borrow Â£382bn for the year - about seven times what was expected pre-Covid.  That depends, though, on the shutdown being lifted sooner rather than later. The Resolution Foundation estimates that if the shutdown continues for six months, borrowing will be even higher for the year - a truly mind-boggling Â£500bn. That's about a quarter of the size of the entire economy. ""The temporary and immediate nature of the unprecedented support announced for people and businesses means the government expects that a significantly higher proportion of total gilt sales in 2020-21 will take place in the first four months of the financial year, in order to meet the immediate financing needs resulting from Covid-19,"" the Treasury said. ""This higher volume of issuance is not expected to be required across the remainder of the financial year.""

"Telecoms engineers have told Radio 1 Newsbeat they're being threatened and harassed by people who believe they're working on 5G, which has been wrongly linked to coronavirus. Claims about any link have been brandedcomplete rubbishby scientists. But the union and trade body representing thousands of workers across the UK say they've had around 120 cases of abuse reported to them. The reports have included threats of extreme violence. ""We've actually had cases where people have been threatened with being stabbed, threatened with physical violence and in some cases actually threatened with murder,"" says Andy Kerr, deputy general secretary of the Communication Workers Union (CWU). CWU represents nearly 40,000 telecoms engineers. Andy says most aren't even working on 5G - they're maintaining the network and playing ""a crucial role"". ""People are stuck at home - whether they want to watch their box set of Peaky Blinders or somebody's isolated and they want to keep in touch with family. ""The only way to do that is the telecom network. More importantly these are engineers maintaining the network so it's there for all the health and emergency services."" Damaged cabling and equipment following a fire at a phone mast in Huddersfield The National Crime Agency has confirmed there has been a series of recent arson attacks and cases of criminal damage to telecommunication masts. Newsbeat's spoken to three engineers who asked for only their first names to be used because they're scared for their safety. Mike's been an engineer for nine years. ""Incidents range from people shouting abuse, videoing, asking us why we're putting up death towers, why we're going to fry everyone. ""We've had objects thrown at engineers. Threats saying they'll come back with groups of lads and stab them. We've had people threaten to shoot us if we don't leave. He admits they have to be ""more vigilant"" whilst doing the job since the abuse and harassment of engineers started. ""There's a lot of uncertainty, We need to keep a bit more of a watchful eye on what's going on and who's about."" ""Everyone I've spoken to says they're having issues. ""Me and my team have had people shouting: 'You're killing everyone, stop putting in the 5G.' Mainly making us feel uncomfortable. Asking us how we are key workers and why we are doing what we're doing. ""There is that worry every day when you get in the van that something could happen  - but you just have to get on with it and keep everyone safe in the meantime."" West Midlands Police says the crimes are ""being taken extremely seriously due to the risk to the public that they pose"". Sam lives with his wife and two daughters and is currently installing temporary sites across the UK for the Nightingale hospitals. ""A member of the public decided to key my truck because he thought I was working on 5G. ""I've made small changes to the way I work. We remove our signage from our vehicles and we're in non-branded company uniform. ""I know of other engineers on sites that have been vandalised -  and they've set fire to masts and the cabins have been smashed up. ""My family is concerned. My wife's at home, she nags me day in day out when I leave the house, to keep in contact and make sure I'm ok. ""I love my job and we're helping to keep everyone including the emergency services connected at this crucial time, so I couldn't feel more valued as an engineer."" This video can not be played Coronavirus: Health claims debunked It's worth saying once again scientists insist there's no link between the high-speed network and Covid-19. Olga Robinson is the BBC's specialist in coronavirus and 5G conspiracy theories. ""Scientists say 5G and the coronavirus are completely different things - as different as chalk and cheese - so you can't get the virus by using 5G. ""They also say 5G can't impact your immune system and make you more susceptible because the radio waves being used aren't strong enough to damage your cells, body or immune system."" ""I think what makes these conspiracy theories more believable is that we still don't know a lot about the coronavirus,"" says Olga. She says the theories also rely on ""so-called experts and use scientific terms so it looks very sophisticated"". And Olga has a few easy tips on how to check what you're reading is true. ""First of all stop and think, don't immediately share,"" says Olga. ""Then check the source of that claim. Who is that person, who is that group that you've seen making the claim?"" In other words, don't believe that message in your WhatsApp group from a friend of a friend claiming to have been sent an email by someone who got an email from a doctor. ""Read the claims carefully and investigate every single one of them because there are so many half-truths doing the rounds on social media. ""And if you're still unsure after all your googling and checks, just don't share - it's a simple as that.""

"Laura Hurlocker, who runs a power generation company with her husband, has been turned down for a bank loan to keep the business going amid the virus. Her bank said the fact her firm had other debts meant that it was not suitable to receive further help. The firm is one of many struggling to get help amid the coronavirus crisis. Figures show banks have so far agreed less than half of applications made under the government's Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan Scheme. Bank lobby group UK Finance, which publishes the figures each week, said so far Â£2.8bn of loans had been agreed compared with the Â£1.1bn approved up to last week. In total, only 16,624 applications have been approved out of 36,000 as banks wade through a large backlog. UK Finance didn't reveal how many companies had been turned down for loans. ""Bank staff are working hard to help viable businesses access the support they need to get them through these challenging times. ""Over half the total number of loans provided through CBILS have been approved in the past eight days alone,"" UK Finance said. Ms Hurlocker's Luton-based firm Fourth Generation supplies power generation equipment to live events, powering concerts hosted by Coldplay, Beyonce and Robbie Williams. She applied for a CBIL loan with her bank Barclays, with whom she has been a customer for 16 years. But her bank turned her down, partly because the business had other loans. The business has some debts because she and her husband have invested Â£350,000 in equipment for the firm in the last three years. ""We feel we are being penalised,"" she told the BBC. ""To be told because you have an existing loan you are deemed by us to be unaffordable. It was a kick in the teeth."" Whilst she accepts that the events industry has been hit harder than other sectors since it relies on mass gatherings, she says she feels businesses should be measured on their health before the crisis hit. The firm owns 90% of its equipment outright, with only a small percentage outstanding on asset finance, she adds. ""We were quite happily trading along six weeks ago,"" she says. ""Were you viable at the point of the shutdown? If the answer is yes, you should get the loan."" While she praised her relationship manager with the bank for doing his best, ultimately without financial help, she says her firm could collapse. Barclays didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. Her next move is to apply to some of the specialist lenders who are becoming CBIL providers. ""We are hanging onto the hope that while the initial funding portals - the banks, which were not so willing to fund us -  we can only hope those secondary level funders will be able to,"" she says. ""Otherwise we will go under. We have no income coming in."" Behind the scenes, banks are keen to stress that they are dealing with an extraordinary number of applications, and that they must follow the rules set by the British Business Bank when it comes to these loans as well as their own lending criteria. Business lobby group the CBI welcomed the fact that the pace of loan approvals had improved, but it said many firms were still missing out. ""More loans must get out the door faster for the businesses facing distress, especially smaller businesses. ""Finding quicker and simpler routes for smaller firms to access cash and extending repayment schedules to encourage more businesses to take them up, are two ways that could make a difference,"" said chief economist Rain Newton-Smith. It was a criticism echoed by the Federation for Small Businesses. ""We now need to know how many micro businesses have been helped by the scheme to date.

"The lack of personal protective equipment (PPE) has become one of the defining stories of the UK's battle with coronavirus. Only this week the British Medical Association was saying doctors on the frontline were ""frightened"" and being left with difficult choices about whether to risk their lives by treating patients because of a lack of kit. The Association of Directors of Adult Social Services has described the approach to care homes as ""shambolic"" as staff have struggled to get hold of the aprons, gloves and goggles needed. What has gone wrong? Last week England's deputy chief medical officer, Dr Jenny Harries, was saying during the televised daily briefing that the UK was an international ""exemplar"" for pandemic preparedness. She faced howls of derision on social media, from MPs and commentators for her comments. But it was perfectly understandable why she made such a claim. The UK has long been seen as an international leader when it comes to pandemic planning and public health. It had a stockpile of kit housed at a giant temperature-controlled warehouse in the north-west of England. There were millions of pieces of equipment, which have proved invaluable in the first few months of the pandemic. And, despite the demands placed on it, the stockpile has still not been completely used up. Nonetheless, frontline staff have found themselves in a position where they have not always had the kit they need. It is worth saying, though, that the UK is not alone in this. Many countries have faced similar problems. In France, President Macron apologised live on TV for shortcomings, including in this area. The ability to judge the preparations is also hampered by the fact the government has refused to publish the full findings of its 2016 pandemic drill named Exercise Cygnus. The three-day event, designed to test the plans, led to a series of recommendations, including some on PPE. It is unclear what short-comings were found and to what extent they were acted on. One of the key areas where the UK has struggled is sourcing new supplies. The crucial piece of kit that there have been shortages of is gowns. These are the full-length fluid-repellent protective gear needed in intensive care, where patients are on ventilators. This is because the UK only has one manufacturer that can make them and because they use quite specialist material other companies have not simply been able to change what they are producing. And that has meant it has not been as simple as getting hold of extra pairs of goggles or visors, which have been, in some instances, supplied and made by schools and universities. It has meant we have been reliant on international supply, and of course there is a big global scramble for this kit. What is more, China is the biggest manufacturer and its factories have been disrupted by its own coronavirus outbreak. Last week the UK received a shipment that was meant to contain 200,000 gowns, but in the end only 20,000 arrived. Hospitals go through 150,000 a day, so it was of limited value. But even where there has been equipment available, the basic distribution networks have struggled. Since the pandemic started, around one billion pieces of kit have been sent out. That is a massive amount and has - at times - overwhelmed the system, especially since stocks constantly need replenishing, as much of the kit has to be discarded after use. Hospitals have two basic routes - the central NHS supply chain, and ordering it themselves. There are hospitals using both routes, which perhaps explains why some appear to be better stocked than others. It has been a similar story in the community. GPs, the police, councils, and - most critically - care services, also need protective kit. Care homes have their own ordering and supply systems, but these too have been overwhelmed, so local resilience forums, composed of emergency services and councils, have been put in charge of distributing equipment across the community in England and Wales. In Scotland and Northern Ireland, councils have taken the lead. To help, the government has enlisted the help of the army. General Sir Nick Carter, the chief of defence staff, the most senior military commander in the UK, has called it the most ""single greatest logistical challenge"" he has ever experienced - there are over 200 hospitals and 50,000 care homes and other community settings to get deliveries too. The issue for community services has been further complicated by a change in guidance before Easter, which meant the amount of protective kit recommended for use in the community increased, leading to some pretty serious shortages. There are signs this is easing now, although council leaders still complain of a lack of information and communication from the central government agencies. UK chief medical adviser Prof Chris Witty acknowledges it has been very tricky because there has not been a lot of ""excess"" in the system, which means any problems in distribution led to it getting ""close to the line"" in places. It will, he says, require careful management in the coming weeks. Assuming distribution networks settle down, the over-riding challenge remains ensuring that a steady supply of new kit can be guaranteed. Health Secretary Matt Hancock has said the drive to secure more kit is the biggest cross-government operation in terms of both scale and complexity he has ever seen, with officials working ""night and day"" to resolve the problem. He says talks are under way with a diverse range of suppliers to secure the necessary PPE. This includes British manufacturers as well as international suppliers.

AVOIDING CONTACT:How to self-isolate and exercise LOOK-UP TOOL:Check cases in your area MAPS AND CHARTS:Visual guide to the outbreak STRESS:How to look after your mental health There has already been one breakthrough. A major deal has been agreed with China to supply 25 million gowns - enough for six months. More agreements are likely to follow. But, understandably, such promises are being treated with caution. Niall Dickson, of the NHS Confederation, which represents health and care leaders, says front-line staff are still surviving ""hand-to-mouth"" and until a long-term supply can be guaranteed, the issue threatens to undermine the fight to tackle the coronavirus.

"Vitamin D supplements are recommended by public health officials during the lockdown There are mounting questions about whether vitamin D can help fight coronavirus. The Scientific Advisory Commission on Nutrition and the health watchdog theNational Institute of Health and Care Excellence (NICE) have done a rapid review of the evidence,external. With more people staying indoors during the pandemic, some may have been deprived of vitamin D. Normally, many of us get it by spending time outside. Our skin makes it when exposed to the sun. The NHS says,externalpeople should consider taking 10 micrograms of vitamin D a day if they are spending a lot of time indoors. Free winter Vitamin D for vulnerable in England Scottish,externalandWelsh,externalgovernments andNorthern Ireland's Public Health Agency,externalissued similar advice during lockdown. Before the pandemic, people in the UK were already advised to consider taking supplements from October to March. Public Health England recommends vitamin D throughout the year if: you are not often outdoors you live in a care home you usually wear clothes that cover up most of your skin when outside People with dark skin may also not be getting enough, even if they spend time outdoors, and should consider an all-year-round supplement. There is evidence that black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) peoplehave a higher risk of getting seriously ill with coronavirus. Vitamin D is important for healthy bones, teeth and muscles. A lack of it can lead to a bone deformity illness called rickets in children, and a similar bone weakness condition called osteomalacia in adults. There are also suggestions that vitamin D boosts the immune system and helps fight off infections. Some studies suggest adequate vitamin D levels help,externalwhen we have common colds and flu, for example. But evidence from research is inconsistent. TheScientific Advisory Committee on Nutrition (SACN),externalsays studies on using vitamin D for treating or preventing chest infections showed insufficient evidence to recommend it for this. A review of research by NICE,externalsuggests there is no evidence to support taking vitamin D supplements to specifically prevent or treat coronavirus. But experts think that it may have some broader health benefits during the pandemic to keep people as nutritionally fit as possible. Some researchers have suggested thatvitamin D deficiency might be linked with poorer outcomes,externalif someone catches coronavirus. But other underlying risk factors, such as heart disease, are common in these patients too, making ithard to draw conclusions,external. Prof Jon Rhodes, Emeritus Professor of Medicine at the University of Liverpool, says vitamin D has anti-inflammatory effects, and some research suggests it may dampen down the body's immune response to viruses. This could be relevant in very ill coronavirus patients, where severe lung damage can result from an inflammatory state in response to the virus, he says, although much more research is needed. No. Although vitamin D supplements are very safe, taking more than the recommended amount every day can be dangerous in the long run. If you choose to take vitamin D supplements: Children aged one to 10 should not have more than 50 micrograms a day Infants (under 12 months) should not have more than 25 micrograms a day Adults should not have more than 100 micrograms a day, with the recommended amount 10 micrograms a day A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? AVOIDING CONTACT:Should I self-isolate? STRESS:How to protect your mental health UK LOOK-UP TOOL:Check cases in your area VIDEO:The 20-second hand wash Higher doses may sometimes be recommended by a doctor for patients with proven vitamin D deficiency. Some people with certain medical conditions, such as kidney problems, cannot safely take vitamin D. Vitamin D supplements are widely available from supermarkets and chemists. They may be just vitamin D or part of a multivitamin tablet. The ingredient listed on the label of most Vitamin D supplements is D3, the one made by your skin. Vitamin D2 is produced by plants. Vitamin drops are available for babies. Some cereals are fortified with vitamin D Although eating a well-balanced diet can help ensure the normal functioning of the immune system, no individual nutrient, food or supplement is going to ""boost"" it beyond normal levels. It's difficult to get enough vitamin D from food alone. Eating a well-balanced diet is important for good health and is advisable even outside a pandemic. It can include vitamin D-rich foods like oily fish and eggs. Some breakfast cereals, margarines and yoghurts are fortified with vitamin D. Although you cannot overdose on vitamin D through exposure to sunlight, strong sun burns skin so you need to balance making vitamin D with being safe in the sun. Cover up or protect your skin with sunscreen to prevent burning and damage. The advice is: breastfed babies from birth to one year old should be given a daily supplement of 8.5 to 10 micrograms of vitamin D to make sure they get enough formula-fed babies should not be given a supplement until they are having less than 500ml (about a pint) of infant formula a day, because formula contains vitamin D children aged one to four should be given a daily supplement of 10 micrograms The dose for adults (10 micrograms a day) applies to pregnant and breastfeeding women.  A higher dose may be recommended for pregnant women with dark skin or with high-risk pregnancies.

"The UK will have to live with some disruptive social measures for at least the rest of the year, the government's chief medical adviser has said. Prof Chris Whitty said it was ""wholly unrealistic"" to expect life would suddenly return to normal soon. He said ""in the long run"" the ideal way out would be via a ""highly effective vaccine"" or drugs to treat the disease. But he warned that the chance of having those within the next calendar year was ""incredibly small"". ""This disease is not going to be eradicated, it is not going to disappear,"" he said, at the government's daily coronavirus briefing. ""So we have to accept that we are working with a disease that we are going to be with globally... for the foreseeable future."" The latest figures show a further 759 people have died with the virus in UK hospitals, bringing the total number of deaths to 18,100. Raab vows to hit 100k test target in eight days Prof Whitty said the public should not expect the number of coronavirus-related deaths to ""fall away"" suddenly after the peak. ""In the long run, the exit from this is going to be one of two things, ideally,"" he said. ""A vaccine, and there are a variety of ways they can be deployed... or highly effective drugs so that people stop dying of this disease even if they catch it, or which can prevent this disease in vulnerable people."" Prof Whitty warned there were multiple different ways in which the coronavirus epidemic would result in deaths or ill health. This video can not be played Prof Chris Whitty on easing restrictions: ""It's going to take a long time"" As well as those dying from Covid-19, he said others may die indirectly because the NHS has had to be ""reoriented towards Covid"",leading to fewer elective procedures and screening. Should we all be wearing masks now? When can I go out? How many cases are there in your area? He also said if the interventions in place ""extend deprivation among people"" that would increase the risk to their long-term health. ""So what we have to do is think very seriously about this: what is the best balance of measures that gives us the best public health outcome?"" He said there was a ""proper trade-off"" which ministers would have to consider. The government's chief medical adviser and other experts have often said the only secure long term route out of the coronavirus epidemic is the discovery of either a vaccine or effective drugs. So Prof Whitty's latest comments are not a total surprise, however they throw cold water on any idea that lockdown restrictions will be fully lifted in the summer or even the autumn. A vaccine and drugs are unlikely to materialise until next year and until then some form of social distancing will be required, according to Prof Whitty. But that certainly doesn't mean all the current restrictions remain in place until then. Schools, some businesses and public transport might well be reopened in the not too distant future. Pubs and restaurants, under this scenario, will probably be nearer the bottom of the list. Prof Whitty of course is an adviser and it's up to the politicians to decide. They will have to weigh up the impact on the economy and society but also, as they often say, be guided by the science. Also speaking at the briefing, Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said easing social distancing measures too soon would risk a second spike of coronavirus cases. He said this could trigger a second lockdown that would ""prolong the economic pain"" across the country. Mr Raab, who is deputising for Prime Minister Boris Johnson, acknowledged the mental, physical and economic strain social distancing measures were having on people throughout the UK, but said they ""must remain in place for the time being"". Gen Sir Nick Carter, the chief of the defence staff, also joined Wednesday's press conference and described the military response to coronavirus as the ""single greatest logistical feat"" of his 40 years of service. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? AVOIDING CONTACT:The rules on self-isolation and exercise WHAT WE DON'T KNOWHow to understand the death toll TESTING:Can I get tested for coronavirus? LOOK-UP TOOL:Check cases in your area Gen Carter said the military has worked in support of healthcare workers on the front line, and has been involved with planning and testing - along with helping the Foreign Office with repatriation efforts. He added that the military was also preparing mobile pop-up testing centres in a bid to roll-out more Covid-19 testing. Earlier, the government insisted it would meet its target of 100,000 tests a day by the end of April - an increase of 82,000 on Monday's levels. Sir Keir Starmer, who was making his debut in Prime Minister's Questions as Labour leader, said the UK had been ""very slow and way behind other European countries"" on testing. He asked how it was possible to go from 18,000 tests a day to 100,000 in just eight days. Mr Raab said the UK currently had testing capacity of 40,000 a day and, with new laboratories coming on stream, the government would reach its target.

"B&Q in Cardiff reopened its doors to the public on Tuesday The government is facing pressure to give businesses ""hope"" after a warning that social distancing could last for the rest of the year. Senior Tory MP Sir Geoffrey Clifton-Brown said it must discuss a return to normality or risk businesses folding. The hospitality industry has warned that maintaining social distancing until next year would be catastrophic. Cabinet minister Brandon Lewis said there was a difficult balance to strike between health and economic concerns. Latest figures showed a further 616 patients with coronavirus have died in the UK, taking the total number of deaths in UK hospitals to 18,738. The Department of Health said that a further 4,583 people had tested positive for Covid-19 since Wednesday. It comes as the government's chief medical adviser, Prof Chris Whitty, said the UK would have to live with some disruptive social measuresfor at least the rest of the year. And Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon hasoutlined ideas for the initial easing of the lockdown. The businesses adapting to life under lockdown What are the social distancing rules? Tory backbenchers want lockdown eased soon Sir Geoffrey, treasurer of the influential 1922 Committee of backbench Conservatives, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that some companies are ""likely to cease trading"" unless they receive ""some form of indication"" of when they can resume business as usual. ""We have to, on behalf of the businesses of this country, begin to give them a little bit of hope as to when we might be able to get back to normality,"" he said. He stressed that the next steps must be carried out ""gradually"". In response, Northern Ireland Secretary Mr Lewis said certain businesses are ""starting to reopen more stores"" with social distancing measures in place. DIY retailer B&Qsaid it would reopen stores with precautions, while housebuilder Taylor Wimpey and carmaker Jaguar Land Rover said they would also restart operations. However, Mr Lewis said ""we don't want to get ahead of ourselves"" and the best way to protect the public and the NHS was to stay at home. ""One of the most damaging things for our economy would be if we came out of lockdown too early,"" he said, adding that this would risk a second peak. Ms Sturgeon told the Scottish government's daily news conference that it was not possible to return immediately to how life was before the virus and that Covid-19 would be a ""fact of life for some time to come"". She unveiled an initial set of proposals for the eventual easing of restrictions in the country, which suggested: some distancing measures will be in place until at least 2021 children must be educated and businesses must reopen - but continuing efforts will be needed to suppress the virus public gatherings will still be banned and pubs will stay closed for the foreseeable future people with symptoms will still have to stay at home and social distancing and hand hygiene will remain important The plan also suggested that testing, contact tracing and isolation of cases will be vital to keeping the virus under control and it might be necessary to re-impose a lockdown with little notice if there is a danger of another spike in infections. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? AVOIDING CONTACT:The rules on self-isolation and exercise WHAT WE DON'T KNOWHow to understand the death toll TESTING:Can I get tested for coronavirus? LOOK-UP TOOL:Check cases in your area BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg said it was ""more likely than not"" that the UK government at Westminster would spell out ""possible flexing and bending"" of the restrictions around the time of its next review of the lockdown on 7 May. She said ideas were being considered that could allow for ""a semblance of normal life"" while maintaining social distancing. No firm decisions have been taken yet, she added, but considerations included staggering rush hours, employers introducing shift patterns, and different year groups attending school on different days. Meanwhile, leisure industry body Hospitality UK said reopening restaurants, bars and hotels without a plan ""would be catastrophic"", adding that many businesses in the sector would not be able to open with distancing measures in place.

"The UK will have to live with some disruptive social measures for at least the rest of the year, the government's chief medical adviser has said. Prof Chris Whitty said it was ""wholly unrealistic"" to expect life would suddenly return to normal soon. He said ""in the long run"" the ideal way out would be via a ""highly effective vaccine"" or drugs to treat the disease. But he warned that the chance of having those within the next calendar year was ""incredibly small"". ""This disease is not going to be eradicated, it is not going to disappear,"" he said, at the government's daily coronavirus briefing. ""So we have to accept that we are working with a disease that we are going to be with globally... for the foreseeable future."" The latest figures show a further 759 people have died with the virus in UK hospitals, bringing the total number of deaths to 18,100. Raab vows to hit 100k test target in eight days Prof Whitty said the public should not expect the number of coronavirus-related deaths to ""fall away"" suddenly after the peak. ""In the long run, the exit from this is going to be one of two things, ideally,"" he said. ""A vaccine, and there are a variety of ways they can be deployed... or highly effective drugs so that people stop dying of this disease even if they catch it, or which can prevent this disease in vulnerable people."" Prof Whitty warned there were multiple different ways in which the coronavirus epidemic would result in deaths or ill health. This video can not be played Prof Chris Whitty on easing restrictions: ""It's going to take a long time"" As well as those dying from Covid-19, he said others may die indirectly because the NHS has had to be ""reoriented towards Covid"",leading to fewer elective procedures and screening. Should we all be wearing masks now? When can I go out? How many cases are there in your area? He also said if the interventions in place ""extend deprivation among people"" that would increase the risk to their long-term health. ""So what we have to do is think very seriously about this: what is the best balance of measures that gives us the best public health outcome?"" He said there was a ""proper trade-off"" which ministers would have to consider. The government's chief medical adviser and other experts have often said the only secure long term route out of the coronavirus epidemic is the discovery of either a vaccine or effective drugs. So Prof Whitty's latest comments are not a total surprise, however they throw cold water on any idea that lockdown restrictions will be fully lifted in the summer or even the autumn. A vaccine and drugs are unlikely to materialise until next year and until then some form of social distancing will be required, according to Prof Whitty. But that certainly doesn't mean all the current restrictions remain in place until then. Schools, some businesses and public transport might well be reopened in the not too distant future. Pubs and restaurants, under this scenario, will probably be nearer the bottom of the list. Prof Whitty of course is an adviser and it's up to the politicians to decide. They will have to weigh up the impact on the economy and society but also, as they often say, be guided by the science. Also speaking at the briefing, Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said easing social distancing measures too soon would risk a second spike of coronavirus cases. He said this could trigger a second lockdown that would ""prolong the economic pain"" across the country. Mr Raab, who is deputising for Prime Minister Boris Johnson, acknowledged the mental, physical and economic strain social distancing measures were having on people throughout the UK, but said they ""must remain in place for the time being"". Gen Sir Nick Carter, the chief of the defence staff, also joined Wednesday's press conference and described the military response to coronavirus as the ""single greatest logistical feat"" of his 40 years of service. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? AVOIDING CONTACT:The rules on self-isolation and exercise WHAT WE DON'T KNOWHow to understand the death toll TESTING:Can I get tested for coronavirus? LOOK-UP TOOL:Check cases in your area Gen Carter said the military has worked in support of healthcare workers on the front line, and has been involved with planning and testing - along with helping the Foreign Office with repatriation efforts. He added that the military was also preparing mobile pop-up testing centres in a bid to roll-out more Covid-19 testing. Earlier, the government insisted it would meet its target of 100,000 tests a day by the end of April - an increase of 82,000 on Monday's levels. Sir Keir Starmer, who was making his debut in Prime Minister's Questions as Labour leader, said the UK had been ""very slow and way behind other European countries"" on testing. He asked how it was possible to go from 18,000 tests a day to 100,000 in just eight days. Mr Raab said the UK currently had testing capacity of 40,000 a day and, with new laboratories coming on stream, the government would reach its target.

"Most ""wet markets"", such as this one selling prawns in Wuhan, do not sell wildlife The Australian government is calling for the G20 countries to take action on wildlife wet markets, calling them a ""biosecurity and human health risk"". Australia is not yet calling for a ban - but says its own advisers believe they may need to be ""phased out"". ""Wet markets"" are marketplaces that sell fresh food such as meat and fish. But some also sell wildlife - and it's thought the coronavirus may have emerged at a wet market in Wuhan that sold live, ""exotic"" animals. The Huanan market in Wuhan reportedly offered a range of animals including foxes, wolf cubs, civets, turtles, and snakes. The Australian government called foran investigation,externalinto wildlife wet markets after a meeting of G20 agriculture ministers. Speaking to the ABC on Thursday,agriculture minister David Littleproud said,externalhe was not targeting all food markets. ""A wet market, like the Sydney fish market, is perfectly safe,"" he said. ""But when you add wildlife, live wildlife, exotic wildlife - that opens up human risk and biosecurity risk to the extent we have seen. ""And in fact, China themselves reported this to the World Organisation for Animal Health, that that was the cause of Covid-19."" Mr Littleproud said he wanted to ""get the science"" first, but said: ""Even our chief veterinary officer is telling us that he believes they [wildlife wet markets] may need to be phased out."" This video can not be played Donald Trump was recently asked if the virus emanated in a laboratory, rather than market The exact origin of the new coronavirus is not known, but the evidence suggests it came from an animal. According to theWorld Organisation for Animal Health,external, Covid-19 is a ""close relative"" of other viruses found in horseshoe bats. So the virus could have passed from bat to human, or via an ""intermediate host"" - one theory isbat, to pangolin, to human. The Sars coronavirus is thought to have emerged in bats beforepassing to civets and then humans,external. The Mers coronavirus passedfrom camels to humans,external, after probably emerging in bats. In January, China issued a temporary ban in the trade in wild animals, as it did during the Sars outbreak. A month later, the government ""thoroughly banned the illegal trading of wildlife,external"" and ""eliminated the consumption of wild animals to safeguard people's lives and health"". But since then, a number of reports have said wildlife is still being sold in markets in China and elsewhere. WHO developing guidance on wet markets How the pandemic is putting the spotlight on wildlife trade Pangolins carry strains related to new coronavirus More recently, the head of the World Health Organization said all governments must ""rigorously enforce bans on the sale and trade of wildlife for food"".

"The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge's son Prince Louis has been photographed making a colourful rainbow poster - a symbol of hope during the coronavirus lockdown - to mark his second birthday. His handprint artwork is one of several photographs released by the family to celebrate the occasion on Thursday. Similar pictures by children haveappeared in windows across the country. Prince Louis was photographed by his mother the Duchess of Cambridge in Norfolk earlier this month. In a series of images, Kate has captured her son - wearing a smart blue gingham-style shirt - grinning up at the camera while displaying his brightly painted palms and fingers. In one portrait, his coloured digits are raised to his cheeks with apparent excitement. In another photo, Louis has smeared colourful paint all over his face, with Kensington Palaceposting a light-hearted tweet,externalsaying ""Instagram Vs Reality"". The duchess - a keen amateur photographer and patron of the Royal Photographic Society - has regularly released pictures she has taken of her other children, Prince George and Princess Charlotte, to mark their birthdays. Louis' artwork is likely to be part of William and Kate's home-schooling lessons, with the duchess recently admitting she kept the make-shift classroomup and running during the Easter holidays. ""It's just having that bit of structure, actually. It's great, there are so many great tips online and fun activities that you can do with the children so it hasn't been all hardcore,"" she said. Kate also revealed her surprise at her children's awareness about the coronavirus outbreak and how she has tackled the subject with them in ""age appropriate"" ways. Prince Louis Arthur Charles of Cambridge, fifth in line to the throne, was born on St George's Day, 23 April 2018, at the private Lindo Wing of St Mary's Hospital in Paddington, London, weighing 8lb 7oz. He was christened at 11 weeks old, by Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby, in the Chapel Royal at St James's Palace in front of friends and family. Prince Louis has featured in a number of images released by the Cambridges and recently appeared in a video with his older brother and sister applauding the nation's health workers and carers. Prince Charles and his wife the Duchess of Cornwall wished their grandson a ""very happy birthday"" from their Clarence House twitter account. Allow Twitter content?

"Ryan Hoyle said he was ""shaking"" when he got an email informing him he had become a multi-millionaire A man who scooped a Â£58m lottery win celebrated by having a beer with his brothers - at a 2m (6ft 6in) distance. Ryan Hoyle, 38, said he was ""shaking"" when he got an email informing him he had become a multi-millionaire in Friday's EuroMillions draw. He drove to his parents' house, passing his phone through the window for them to ""double-check"" his numbers. After confirming the eight-figure bonanza, he enjoyed a drink in the sunshine with his siblings. Mr Hoyle, of Rochdale, Greater Manchester, said he first thought he had won Â£2.30 when he saw an email from the National Lottery on Saturday. When he read the message, he said it ""looked like a lot of numbers... I couldn't believe what my eyes were seeing"". He said he was ""shaking and really needed a second opinion so... drove round to mum and dad's house"".

Some of the main developments today:  Today's live page was written by our journalists in Australia, Singapore, India, the UK and US: Anna Jones, Yvette Tan, Andreas Illmer, Krutika Pathi, Frances Mao, Kelly-Leigh Cooper, Alexandra Fouche, Rebecca Morton, Dulcie Lee, Saj Chowdhury, Michael Emons,  Emlyn Begley, Marie Jackson, Rob Greenall, Lucy Webster, Paul Seddon, Yaroslav Lukov, Holly Hondereich, Ritu Prasad, Ian Youngs, Helier Cheung and Jude Sheerin. Anthony ZurcherBBC North America reporter The harsh political reality for the president is he faces a re-election contest in just over six months, and the longer the lockdown drags on, the less time the economy will have to recover before voters head to the ballot box. Current polling suggests he is trailing presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden nationally and in key battleground states, and while the race is likely to tighten and the president has abundant resources to run a robust campaign, Trump appears destined for an uphill fight. The president also faces a flip-side risk of being seen as supporting re-opening too quickly and shouldering the blame if there is a subsequent spike in cases. That could explain why, just days after calling for states to begin reopening process, he criticised the Republican governor of Georgia for lifting restrictions on places like hair salons, bars and tattoo parlours, where social distancing guidelines would be difficult to follow. It's a difficult line for any politician to walk, and in the days ahead the stakes will be at their highest. Here's Anthony's full piece:Coronavirus pandemic exposes rather than heals America's divisions Trump was also asked how the November presidential election could go ahead amid the coronavirus outbreak. ""I can't tell you what's going to happen in an election,"" Trump says. ""We have a sleepy guy in a basement of a house that the press is giving a free pass to, who doesn't want to do debates because of Covid,"" he says of former Vice-President Joe Biden, his likely Democratic challenger, whom he often calls ""Sleepy Joe"". ""I watched a couple of interviews, and I say 'Oh I look forward to this,'"" Trump says. ""But they're keeping him sheltered."" Biden cancelled all in-person campaign events beginning in mid-March as social-distancing measures were ordered throughout the US. He has continued to hold interviews and digital fundraisers from his home in Delaware, and launched a podcast last month. In an interview today, Biden said he was ""ready to debate"" Trump. ""Zoom or Skype or Slack or hangouts or in person, anytime, anywhere he wants."" The US president also claimed knowledge in the fields of medicine and economics during the news conference. ""I'm not a doctor but I'm a person who has a good you-know-what,"" he said at one point, apparently gesturing to his brain. At another point: ""I know a lot about economists and the answer is they have no idea. I think I have as good of an idea as anybody."" Captain Tom Moore, the 99-year-old British Army veteran who has raised Â£28.5m ($35m) for the NHS, could be number one in the UK music charts this weekend - but he's in a tight race with a Canadian pop star. A version of You'll Never Walk Alone featuring the voice of Captain Tom was thought to be on course to be number one, but earlier on Thursday, The Weeknd's Blinding Lights overtook him. However, in a late twist, The Weeknd has now thrown his weight behind Captain Tom. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The number one will be revealed just before 18:00 BST on Friday. The briefing is now over but to recap, Trump launched an extraordinary attack on his ally, Georgia Governor Brian Kemp, over his aggressive reopening plan for his state. ""I want the states to open, more than he does, much more than he does,"" Trump says of Kemp. ""But I didn't like to see spas [reopening] at this early stage, nor did the doctors."" Kemp said hair salons, gyms, bowling alleys and nail salons would be allowed to reopen on Friday, with restaurants following suit on Monday. ""I didn't like to see a lot of things happening, and I wasn't happy with it, and I wasn't happy with Brian Kemp,"" Trump says. ""I could have done something about it if I wanted to, but I'm saying, 'Let the governors do it.'"" The BBC's Jon Sopel asks Trump how British Prime Minister Boris Johnson was when he spoke to him this week. ""He called me a few days ago, I will tell you he sounded incredible. I was actually surprisedâ¦ he was ready to go, Iâm very surprised to tell you this, itâs like, the old Boris, tremendous energy, tremendous drive."" He adds: ""Because he called me almost pretty close to when he got out of the hospital, I think heâs doing great, he was so sharp and energetic, pretty incredible, heâs an incredible guy, heâs a friend of ours and a friend of mine, he loves our country, he loves his country a lotâ¦ and theyâre lucky to have him over there."" Trump is asked about the new guidance suggesting the virus is vulnerable to heat and humidity, particularly given that countries with hot weather, like Singapore, have also been hit by the outbreak. ""I hope people enjoy the sun,"" Trump says. ""And if it has an impact that's great.... maybe you can, maybe you can't. I'm not a doctor"" He then asks Dr Deborah Birx, a co-ordinator of the White House virus response whether heat can help kill the virus. ""Deborah have you ever heard of that? The heat, and the light relative to certain viruses, yes, but to this virus?"" ""Not as a treatment,"" Dr Birx says. ""I mean, certainly, fever, is a good thing. When you have a fever it helps your body respond."" But she does not believe it works as a treatment, she repeats. Katya AdlerEurope Editor Very
aware of the negative headlines of late, depicting EU leader v EU leader; the
rich and frugal North v the suffering, spendthrift South, there was a
determination at Thursdayâs EU summit to avoid the verbal fisticuffs. There was no
walkout by ""Angry Italy"". No fuming about Eurobonds by the Dutch. Instead EU
leaders signed off, as expected, on a pre-agreed â¬500bn ($540bn; Â£435bn) emergency
financial package and on guidelines for lifting Covid-19 restrictions. Heated
discussion about a recovery plan for European economies after the health
crisis was left for another day - the buck passed to the European Commission
which now has the unenviable task of conjuring up a proposal  acceptable
to divided EU opinion. Today at least, EU leaders were keen to present a united
front. Their underlying intended message: âYes, we argue but EU solidarity
exists. We muddle our way through in the end.â Trump is asked why he has stopped promoting hydroxychloroquine, a malaria and lupus medication, as a possible treatment for coronavirus. âI havenât at all... weâll see what happens,â he says. The president's public remarks hyping the drug have decreased substantially over the past week or so. He says today he hasnât seen a recent study that said coronavirus patients taking hydroxychloroquine had higher death rates. That research followed 368 patients at US Veterans Health Administration medical centres. The 97 patients who took hydroxychloroquine had a 27.8% death rate. The 158 patients who did not take the drug had an 11.4% death rate. The BBC's Jon Sopel asks a question about the new guidance suggesting the virus is vulnerable to heat and humidity. ""At the moment the advice is stay at home, by the summer could we be flipping that, and saying you'll be much better off being outside?"" Sopel asks. ""I would not go contrary to the guidance that has been issued right now,"" Bryan says. He adds: ""If I'm having an event with my family, I'm doing it in the driveway or the backyard, not inside the house."" ""In fact I'm thinking about moving outside to the rose garden,"" Trump jokes. William Bryan, the under secretary for science and technology at the US Department of Homeland Security, says the coronavirus may be killed faster under increased temperature, humidity and sunlight. ""We identified that heat and humidity is a weakness"" of the virus' ability to spread, Bryan says, showing data suggesting that the virus could survive for 90 seconds under direct sunlight, and for 90 minutes without any solar contact. The findings are an ""emerging"" result of their work, Bryan says. Helier CheungBBC News, Washington DC More than 26 million Americans have filed for unemployment in the past five weeks - over 15% of the US workforce. One American who has lost her job recently is Rachel Sterner, who worked as a stage manager for the Broadway production of Harry Potter and the Cursed Child. She says: ""I loved my job - it was my responsibility to maintain the artistic integrity of the show, and it's a challenging and beautiful show. ""Working in theatre means being laid off is not a foreign concept - but normally, if you lose a job, you can get on another project. This is different - there won't be work for a long time. ""Even if we do a show at half-capacity, who knows how long it'll be till tourists come back, and people have disposable income for the theatre?"" You can read more of the human stories behind the unemployment figureshere. Meanwhile, the US House of Representatives has voted 388-5 to pass a $484bn (Â£390bn) emergency aid bill meant to replenish depleted relief programs for small businesses. The bill, passed by the Senate earlier this week, will also provide funding for hospitals and coronavirus testing. It will not provide money to state governments. Lawmakers donned face masks and maintained social distancing as they assembled in the Capitol today. To vote, members were divided alphabetically into groups of roughly 60 people and were asked to stay in their offices until their group was called. Vice-President Mike Pence says that 4.93 million coronavirus tests have been completed across the US, adding that commercial labs surpassed 100,000 tests yesterday. Pence says that he is ""encouraged"" by states' ""phased approach"" to reopening their economies. ""We're slowing the spread, we're protecting the most vulnerable, we're saving lives and every single day we are one day closer to opening up America again,"" Pence says. Taking the stage after Donald Trump, Vice-President Mike Pence says the data continues to show ""promising signs of progress"" in the US fight against coronavirus. Major virus hotspots including the New York Metro Area, New Jersey, Connecticut, Detroit and New Orleans ""all appear to be past their peak"", Pence says. ""Our only conclusion is that we're getting there, America,"" he adds. ""If we continue these mitigation efforts in the days ahead... we do believe by early summer we could be in a much better place as a nation, with much of this coronavirus epidemic behind us."" He says 16 states have released formal reopening plans so far. An Ohio family has cancelled plans to livestream the funeral of
father-of-two John McDaniel, who died on 15 April after testing positive for
Covid-19, after a deluge of backlash against his social media posts criticising
stay-home orders. In
a statement, McDaniel's wife of more than 30 years, Lisa McDaniel, wrote that
the livestream would be cancelled as ""John's story, along with early
assumptions that he stated on Twitter and Facebook had turned into national
news"". ""This
news has opened flood gates for people to share their own misguided anger and
unfounded assumptions about a man they don't know."" McDaniel's
posts disparaged stay home mandates ordered by Ohio Governor Mike DeWine, and
called the virus response ""madness"". ""As
each day passes, we are all learning more about this 'invisible enemy,'""
Lisa wrote. ""We know if John was still here with us he would acknowledge
the national crisis we are in, abide by the stay-at-home-order, and encourage
family and friends to do the same."" In his obituary, McDaniel is described as an
""outdoorsman"", a loving father and husband, and an ""ornery
son-of-a-gun"". Donald Trump says ""we are very close to a vaccine"", after noting vaccine trials taking place in the US, Germany, the United Kingdom and China. ""We have a lot of great, brilliant minds working on this,"" he says. ""Unfortunately we're not very close to testing because when testing starts it takes a period of time, but we'll get it done."" Dr Anthony Fauci, the US government's top infectious diseases expert, has previously said that a vaccine will likely take 12-18 months to be approved for widespread use. Most health experts also agree that it would take at least 12-18 months before a vaccine is ready. The first human trial in Europe of a coronavirus vaccine has begun in the UK US President Donald Trump has taken the podium for his daily White House coronavirus briefing. He is joined by Vice-President Mike Pence and Deborah Birx, the White House coronavirus taskforce co-ordinator.

Brian TaylorBBC Scotland Political Editor Perhaps it is the miasma of partisan politics. Perhaps it is scrutiny from the wicked media. Perhaps it is instinctive. Whatever the cause, political leaders generally like to exude certainty. They will say: ""I believe I have been completely clear about this"" Or: ""Let me assure the Houseâ¦â¦"" By contrast, many ministers of my acquaintance have been in an honourable lather of uncertainty much of the time. That is because the decisions confronting them are tough, really tough. But they pretend otherwise. They fear to let it seem that they are havering or dovering, to use two fine Scots words. Nicola Sturgeon has, to a large extent, abandoned the pretence. In all her remarkable pronouncements during this quite remarkable period, she has constantly stressed that she may have to change tack, that she is open to other ideas. That she is, in short, uncertain. Indeed, she used the word ""uncertainty"" repeatedly today as she set out her framework for a possible exit strategy.

BBC One's Big Night In, which begins at 19:00, will include the unveiling of a home-made video for a charity single featuring stars like Dua Lipa, Chris Martin and Rita Ora. Little Britain, Peter Kay, The Vicar of Dibley and Catherine Tate will all also return during the three-hour special. The show will aim to raise millions of pounds for vulnerable people around the UK who have been affected by the pandemic. The government has pledged to match all public donations, with a minimum of Â£20 million. Alex MurrayBBC News Analysis by BBC News suggests some 103 healthcare workers are now believed to have died from coronavirus. 53 were men, 49 women. Black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) people represent 65 of those deaths, where we have been able to establish ethnicity. 13 have been reported as Filipino. We've been unable to verify whether these people tested positive for the virus. Instead, our information comes from public reports where the family or workplace have said their death was related to Covid-19. Of the doctors who we believe were working in a hospital environment, all 16 were BAME and male, with a significant majority over 50. Medical staff account for 22 deaths; nursing and midwifery 34 deaths; allied occupations 47 deaths. It is unclear how many contracted the virus in the course of their work in the health sector. Separate analysis by Health Service Journal,externalsuggest that the rate of death is ""largely consistent with the number of healthcare workers in the population"". BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg asks Matt Hancock about the governmentâs transparency on what comes next â it comes after theScottish government today set out its lockdown exit strategy. Matt Hancock says he understands the ""thirst for knowledge"", but the five tests the UK government has set out are âcriticalâ. He says the ""message remains the same â that people need to stay at home to protect the NHS and save lives"". ""It is succeedingâ¦ but we are not through that yet and there is still a lot of work to be done."" Here our health correspondent looks at the UK governmentâs five tests.

We must be satisfied transmission has been suppressed Mr Swinney says. ""We've got to be really careful about what we do to fuel the spread of the virus because we have more social interaction."" We may be able to open schools to a small amount of pupils, the education secretary says, suggesting this could be those due to sit their national qualifications in 2021 or those transitioning from primary to secondary school or those starting P1. He says it is ""inevitable"" schools will return in a segmented fashion, with it being unlikely schools will open all at once on one day. Allow Twitter content?

After falling seriously ill with coronavirus, she was admitted to hospital earlier this month. Read her storyof life - and near-death - on a high-risk Covid-19 ward. A body representing Indian-origin doctors in the UK has written to the NHS calling for all staff to urgently be risk-assessed for age, sex, ethnicity and health conditions. Ethnic minorities in the UK are disproportionately more likely to become critically ill with the coronavirus - 34% of ICU patients are Bame (Black, Asian and minority ethnic), despite making up only about 13% of the general population. A disproportionate number of NHS staff who've died of the virus have also been Bame. A government review is looking into the issue. ""There is palpable worry, upset and at times anger amongst them that the matter [of Bame mortality rates] is not being addressed with sufficient urgency,""the British Association of Physicians of Indian Origin (Bapio) said.,external The letter adds that many of the health conditions likely to make people more susceptible to Covid-19 - including hypertension, diabetes and vitamin D deficiency - are more common in Bame people in the UK than the rest of the population. It says if staff are deemed to be at significant risk they should be deployed in non-Covid working environments or asked to work remotely. It also asks that Bame staff be tested for vitamin D deficiency. Read more about how the coronavirus is affecting Bame communities in the UK. Chloroquine and derivatives have been used against malaria Fauci says he has no concerns that public health officials are being muzzled by the Trump administration, noting that he is still on the podium even after expressing dissenting views. He was responding to a question about hydroxychloroquine, a drug touted by the president as a possible coronavirus treatment. There has been a global surge in demand for drugs normally used against malaria to tackle the coronavirus, as governments urgently seek out treatments for the new disease. Chloroquine, and a related derivative, hydroxychloroquine, have gained attention - despite the World Health Organization (WHO) saying there is no definitive evidence they work. According to a study released on Tuesday, coronavirus patients taking hydroxychloroquine had higher death rates compared with those who did not take the drug. The research focused on 368 patients at US Veterans Health Administration medical centres. It found 97 patients who took hydroxychloroquine had a 27.8% mortality rate. The 158 patients who did not take the drug had an 11.4% death rate. The research, which was not peer reviewed or published in a medical journal, was funded by the National Institutes of Health and the University of Virginia. So what exactly is the evidence of the effectiveness of malaria drugs as a treatment for the coronavirus, and who is using them? Read the full story from our Reality Check team here. US Health Secretary Alex Azar US Health Secretary Alex Azar reportedly appointed a trusted aide who previously ran a dog-breeding business in Texas to lead the Department of Health and Human Servicesâ day-to-day response to coronavirus. The aide, Brian Harrison, 37, had no experience in public health or medicine, reports Reuters. Asked about this, Trump says: ""I don't know about that."" Before joining the Trump administration Harrison ran a company called Dallas Labradoodles for six years, according to financial disclosures unearthed by Reuters news agency. Five sources told Reuters that some officials in the White House derisively called him âthe dog breeder"". âEveryone had to report up through him,â said one official. Infectious disease chief Dr Fauci is asked about the recent news oftwo pet cats catching Covid-19. ""Certainly animals, pets can get infected,"" he says, noting big cats in zoos have become infected with the coronavirus. But he says there is no proof the virus can be transmitted from pets to humans. ""Biologically, anything is possible,"" Fauci says. ""But there's no evidence whatsoever that we have seen from an epidemiological standpoint that pets can be transmitters within a household."" Fauci also points out that finding an animal has the virus does not necessarily mean the animal is transmitting it. He says zoo animals that have caught Covid-19 likely contracted it from an asymptomatic keeper who was caring for them. Trump was asked about a senior government vaccine expert, Dr Rick Bright, who says he has been sidelined for refusing to toe the political line. The president says: ""I've never heard of him."" On the claim he was driven out, Trump adds: ""Maybe he was, maybe he wasn't."" Dr Brighttold the New York Times,externalhe was removed after conflicting with the Trump administration over unproven coronavirus treatments. The president has often touted chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine as possible treatments against Covid-19. So what does President Trump's immigration order do? For the next 60 days, it will bar anyone who is currently outside the United States and does not have a valid immigrant visa or travel document. It does not affect:  Carolyn Goodman, the independent mayor of Las Vegas, has said she proposed offering the city as a ""control group"" to test out dropping social distancing measures. âWell, how do you know unless you have a control group?â she said on CNN, adding that she had offered to let Las Vegas be a control group but was turned down by statisticians. Ms Goodman wants to see the city's casinos, hotels and businesses reopened. ""We have to open up,"" she said. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Infectious diseases chief Dr Anthony Fauci says he is ""convinced"" the US ""will have coronavirus in the fall"" because of how transmissible the disease is. But he says the nation will be ""much, much better prepared"" in the autumn ""compared to what happened to us this winter"". Fauci notes that the programme to deal with Covid-19 ""is not one that is going to be, âturn the lights on in America, weâre finished'."" ""We have to proceed in a very careful and measured way,"" he says, adding that the guidelines by the administration are just that. Fauci also says that if the US does not adopt such an approach, ""thereâs a likelihood that it will rebound and the one way not to reopen the economy is to have a rebound that we canât take care of"". ""If you leave the virus to its own devices it will take off,"" Fauci adds. Trump thanks Harvard University after it decided not to accept nearly $9m (Â£7.3m) in coronavirus relief aid. The president said on Tuesday he was unhappy that the prestigious US university had received stimulus money. ""I'm pleased to announce that Harvard has announced today that they will not accept the funds, nor will Stanford University or many of the others that were involved,"" he said. ""They're not accepting the money and that's great, so I want to thank Harvard, I want to thank Stanford and I want to thank the other companies,"" he added. President Trump tells reporters he's just signed an executive order that he said yesterday would temporarily suspend green cards. âIâve just signed it before coming into the room,â he says. ""This will ensure unemployed Americans of all backgrounds will be first in line for jobs as our economy reopens,"" Trump adds. ""As for amending it, extending it, that we can do at the appropriate time."" Here'sour story. The president also noted he disagreed ""strongly"" with Georgia Governor Brian Kemp, a fellow Republican, who has decided to reopen some non-essential businesses. ""I told the governor very simply I disagree,"" Trump says, noting ""safety has to predominate"" in reopening the states. ""I think spas and beauty salons and tattoo parlours and barber shops - in phase one [of reopening] is just too soon."" The president added: ""But at the same time I want him to do what he thinks is right.â Kemp, a Trump ally, on Monday announced Georgia would allow gyms, bowling alleys, nail salons and massage therapists to open on Friday. In-person church services can resume. Restaurants and cinemas can also open. His order also prohibited cities from imposing their own restrictions on businesses. ""It's been encouraging to watch states begin to open up, it's a beautiful thing to see,"" Trump says. ""I want to remind all Americans to adhere to our guidelines, very important,"" Trump adds. He goes on to say he wants the state governors ""to do what they think is best, but ideally they'll adhere"" to the administration's guidance. He reminds Americans to wash their hands, avoid close contact and wear a face covering in cases where social distancing is impractical. ""We don't want a rebound,"" Trump says. The president's reminder comes after weeks of anti-lockdown protests across the country. Protesters say the restrictions in states are an overreaction and have demanded governors reopen their economies. Democratic governors had requested the Trump administration remind Americans of the guidelines due to these demonstrations.  Trump asks Dr Deborah Birx, one of the taskforce experts, if there is a good chance that Covid-19 won't come back at all. Birx instead says it'll be easier to find it if it does. ""I think we are assured that the CDC is putting in place today what we are going to need in the fall so that we can stay in containment if, potentially, the virus comes back,"" she says. ""We're hoping that the flu infections also go down because people are much more aware of respiratory illnesses and how to protect themselves."" Trump says: ""And if it comes back, though, it won't be coming back in the form that it was. It will be coming back in smaller doses that we can contain. He says ""you could have some embers of corona"", but adds: ""We will not go through what we've been going through for the last two months."" ""It might not come back at all,"" he adds. Trump says recent comments from Centers for Disease Control (CDC) Director Dr Robert Redfield that a second Covid-19 wave could be even worse were ""inaccurate"". ""He was totally misquoted,"" Trump says. ""His whole purpose in making the statement was to get a flu shot."" Redfield joins Trump to clarify. He says he noted that next autumn ""could be more difficult, more complicated"" if influenza and Covid-19 were circulating at the same time. ""I think it's really important to emphasise what I didn't say,"" Redfield says. ""I didn't say this was going to be worse, I said it was going to be more difficult and potentially complicated. ""The issue that I was talking about being more difficult is we're going to have two viruses circulating at the same time."" Redfield says he was accurately quoted in the Washington Post, but takes issue with the headline, âCDC director warns second wave of coronavirus is likely to be even more devastatingâ. Here's what Redfield is quoted as saying by the Post: âThereâs a possibility that the assault of the virus on our nation next winter will actually be even more difficult than the one we just went through. ""Weâre going to have the flu epidemic and the coronavirus epidemic at the same time.â Trump tweeted about this earlier: Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"The lack of personal protective equipment (PPE) has become one of the defining stories of the UK's battle with coronavirus. Only this week the British Medical Association was saying doctors on the frontline were ""frightened"" and being left with difficult choices about whether to risk their lives by treating patients because of a lack of kit. The Association of Directors of Adult Social Services has described the approach to care homes as ""shambolic"" as staff have struggled to get hold of the aprons, gloves and goggles needed. What has gone wrong? Last week England's deputy chief medical officer, Dr Jenny Harries, was saying during the televised daily briefing that the UK was an international ""exemplar"" for pandemic preparedness. She faced howls of derision on social media, from MPs and commentators for her comments. But it was perfectly understandable why she made such a claim. The UK has long been seen as an international leader when it comes to pandemic planning and public health. It had a stockpile of kit housed at a giant temperature-controlled warehouse in the north-west of England. There were millions of pieces of equipment, which have proved invaluable in the first few months of the pandemic. And, despite the demands placed on it, the stockpile has still not been completely used up. Nonetheless, frontline staff have found themselves in a position where they have not always had the kit they need. It is worth saying, though, that the UK is not alone in this. Many countries have faced similar problems. In France, President Macron apologised live on TV for shortcomings, including in this area. The ability to judge the preparations is also hampered by the fact the government has refused to publish the full findings of its 2016 pandemic drill named Exercise Cygnus. The three-day event, designed to test the plans, led to a series of recommendations, including some on PPE. It is unclear what short-comings were found and to what extent they were acted on. One of the key areas where the UK has struggled is sourcing new supplies. The crucial piece of kit that there have been shortages of is gowns. These are the full-length fluid-repellent protective gear needed in intensive care, where patients are on ventilators. This is because the UK only has one manufacturer that can make them and because they use quite specialist material other companies have not simply been able to change what they are producing. And that has meant it has not been as simple as getting hold of extra pairs of goggles or visors, which have been, in some instances, supplied and made by schools and universities. It has meant we have been reliant on international supply, and of course there is a big global scramble for this kit. What is more, China is the biggest manufacturer and its factories have been disrupted by its own coronavirus outbreak. Last week the UK received a shipment that was meant to contain 200,000 gowns, but in the end only 20,000 arrived. Hospitals go through 150,000 a day, so it was of limited value. But even where there has been equipment available, the basic distribution networks have struggled. Since the pandemic started, around one billion pieces of kit have been sent out. That is a massive amount and has - at times - overwhelmed the system, especially since stocks constantly need replenishing, as much of the kit has to be discarded after use. Hospitals have two basic routes - the central NHS supply chain, and ordering it themselves. There are hospitals using both routes, which perhaps explains why some appear to be better stocked than others. It has been a similar story in the community. GPs, the police, councils, and - most critically - care services, also need protective kit. Care homes have their own ordering and supply systems, but these too have been overwhelmed, so local resilience forums, composed of emergency services and councils, have been put in charge of distributing equipment across the community in England and Wales. In Scotland and Northern Ireland, councils have taken the lead. To help, the government has enlisted the help of the army. General Sir Nick Carter, the chief of defence staff, the most senior military commander in the UK, has called it the most ""single greatest logistical challenge"" he has ever experienced - there are over 200 hospitals and 50,000 care homes and other community settings to get deliveries too. The issue for community services has been further complicated by a change in guidance before Easter, which meant the amount of protective kit recommended for use in the community increased, leading to some pretty serious shortages. There are signs this is easing now, although council leaders still complain of a lack of information and communication from the central government agencies. UK chief medical adviser Prof Chris Witty acknowledges it has been very tricky because there has not been a lot of ""excess"" in the system, which means any problems in distribution led to it getting ""close to the line"" in places. It will, he says, require careful management in the coming weeks. Assuming distribution networks settle down, the over-riding challenge remains ensuring that a steady supply of new kit can be guaranteed. Health Secretary Matt Hancock has said the drive to secure more kit is the biggest cross-government operation in terms of both scale and complexity he has ever seen, with officials working ""night and day"" to resolve the problem. He says talks are under way with a diverse range of suppliers to secure the necessary PPE. This includes British manufacturers as well as international suppliers. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? AVOIDING CONTACT:How to self-isolate and exercise LOOK-UP TOOL:Check cases in your area MAPS AND CHARTS:Visual guide to the outbreak STRESS:How to look after your mental health There has already been one breakthrough. A major deal has been agreed with China to supply 25 million gowns - enough for six months. More agreements are likely to follow. But, understandably, such promises are being treated with caution. Niall Dickson, of the NHS Confederation, which represents health and care leaders, says front-line staff are still surviving ""hand-to-mouth"" and until a long-term supply can be guaranteed, the issue threatens to undermine the fight to tackle the coronavirus.

After falling seriously ill with coronavirus, she was admitted to hospital earlier this month. Read her storyof life - and near-death - on a high-risk Covid-19 ward. A body representing Indian-origin doctors in the UK has written to the NHS calling for all staff to urgently be risk-assessed for age, sex, ethnicity and health conditions. Ethnic minorities in the UK are disproportionately more likely to become critically ill with the coronavirus - 34% of ICU patients are Bame (Black, Asian and minority ethnic), despite making up only about 13% of the general population. A disproportionate number of NHS staff who've died of the virus have also been Bame. A government review is looking into the issue. ""There is palpable worry, upset and at times anger amongst them that the matter [of Bame mortality rates] is not being addressed with sufficient urgency,""the British Association of Physicians of Indian Origin (Bapio) said.,external The letter adds that many of the health conditions likely to make people more susceptible to Covid-19 - including hypertension, diabetes and vitamin D deficiency - are more common in Bame people in the UK than the rest of the population. It says if staff are deemed to be at significant risk they should be deployed in non-Covid working environments or asked to work remotely. It also asks that Bame staff be tested for vitamin D deficiency. Read more about how the coronavirus is affecting Bame communities in the UK. Chloroquine and derivatives have been used against malaria Fauci says he has no concerns that public health officials are being muzzled by the Trump administration, noting that he is still on the podium even after expressing dissenting views. He was responding to a question about hydroxychloroquine, a drug touted by the president as a possible coronavirus treatment. There has been a global surge in demand for drugs normally used against malaria to tackle the coronavirus, as governments urgently seek out treatments for the new disease. Chloroquine, and a related derivative, hydroxychloroquine, have gained attention - despite the World Health Organization (WHO) saying there is no definitive evidence they work. According to a study released on Tuesday, coronavirus patients taking hydroxychloroquine had higher death rates compared with those who did not take the drug. The research focused on 368 patients at US Veterans Health Administration medical centres. It found 97 patients who took hydroxychloroquine had a 27.8% mortality rate. The 158 patients who did not take the drug had an 11.4% death rate. The research, which was not peer reviewed or published in a medical journal, was funded by the National Institutes of Health and the University of Virginia. So what exactly is the evidence of the effectiveness of malaria drugs as a treatment for the coronavirus, and who is using them? Read the full story from our Reality Check team here. US Health Secretary Alex Azar US Health Secretary Alex Azar reportedly appointed a trusted aide who previously ran a dog-breeding business in Texas to lead the Department of Health and Human Servicesâ day-to-day response to coronavirus. The aide, Brian Harrison, 37, had no experience in public health or medicine, reports Reuters. Asked about this, Trump says: ""I don't know about that."" Before joining the Trump administration Harrison ran a company called Dallas Labradoodles for six years, according to financial disclosures unearthed by Reuters news agency. Five sources told Reuters that some officials in the White House derisively called him âthe dog breeder"". âEveryone had to report up through him,â said one official. Infectious disease chief Dr Fauci is asked about the recent news oftwo pet cats catching Covid-19. ""Certainly animals, pets can get infected,"" he says, noting big cats in zoos have become infected with the coronavirus. But he says there is no proof the virus can be transmitted from pets to humans. ""Biologically, anything is possible,"" Fauci says. ""But there's no evidence whatsoever that we have seen from an epidemiological standpoint that pets can be transmitters within a household."" Fauci also points out that finding an animal has the virus does not necessarily mean the animal is transmitting it. He says zoo animals that have caught Covid-19 likely contracted it from an asymptomatic keeper who was caring for them. Trump was asked about a senior government vaccine expert, Dr Rick Bright, who says he has been sidelined for refusing to toe the political line. The president says: ""I've never heard of him."" On the claim he was driven out, Trump adds: ""Maybe he was, maybe he wasn't."" Dr Brighttold the New York Times,externalhe was removed after conflicting with the Trump administration over unproven coronavirus treatments. The president has often touted chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine as possible treatments against Covid-19. So what does President Trump's immigration order do? For the next 60 days, it will bar anyone who is currently outside the United States and does not have a valid immigrant visa or travel document. It does not affect:  Carolyn Goodman, the independent mayor of Las Vegas, has said she proposed offering the city as a ""control group"" to test out dropping social distancing measures. âWell, how do you know unless you have a control group?â she said on CNN, adding that she had offered to let Las Vegas be a control group but was turned down by statisticians. Ms Goodman wants to see the city's casinos, hotels and businesses reopened. ""We have to open up,"" she said. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Infectious diseases chief Dr Anthony Fauci says he is ""convinced"" the US ""will have coronavirus in the fall"" because of how transmissible the disease is. But he says the nation will be ""much, much better prepared"" in the autumn ""compared to what happened to us this winter"". Fauci notes that the programme to deal with Covid-19 ""is not one that is going to be, âturn the lights on in America, weâre finished'."" ""We have to proceed in a very careful and measured way,"" he says, adding that the guidelines by the administration are just that. Fauci also says that if the US does not adopt such an approach, ""thereâs a likelihood that it will rebound and the one way not to reopen the economy is to have a rebound that we canât take care of"". ""If you leave the virus to its own devices it will take off,"" Fauci adds. Trump thanks Harvard University after it decided not to accept nearly $9m (Â£7.3m) in coronavirus relief aid. The president said on Tuesday he was unhappy that the prestigious US university had received stimulus money. ""I'm pleased to announce that Harvard has announced today that they will not accept the funds, nor will Stanford University or many of the others that were involved,"" he said. ""They're not accepting the money and that's great, so I want to thank Harvard, I want to thank Stanford and I want to thank the other companies,"" he added. President Trump tells reporters he's just signed an executive order that he said yesterday would temporarily suspend green cards. âIâve just signed it before coming into the room,â he says. ""This will ensure unemployed Americans of all backgrounds will be first in line for jobs as our economy reopens,"" Trump adds. ""As for amending it, extending it, that we can do at the appropriate time."" Here'sour story. The president also noted he disagreed ""strongly"" with Georgia Governor Brian Kemp, a fellow Republican, who has decided to reopen some non-essential businesses. ""I told the governor very simply I disagree,"" Trump says, noting ""safety has to predominate"" in reopening the states. ""I think spas and beauty salons and tattoo parlours and barber shops - in phase one [of reopening] is just too soon."" The president added: ""But at the same time I want him to do what he thinks is right.â Kemp, a Trump ally, on Monday announced Georgia would allow gyms, bowling alleys, nail salons and massage therapists to open on Friday. In-person church services can resume. Restaurants and cinemas can also open. His order also prohibited cities from imposing their own restrictions on businesses. ""It's been encouraging to watch states begin to open up, it's a beautiful thing to see,"" Trump says. ""I want to remind all Americans to adhere to our guidelines, very important,"" Trump adds. He goes on to say he wants the state governors ""to do what they think is best, but ideally they'll adhere"" to the administration's guidance. He reminds Americans to wash their hands, avoid close contact and wear a face covering in cases where social distancing is impractical. ""We don't want a rebound,"" Trump says. The president's reminder comes after weeks of anti-lockdown protests across the country. Protesters say the restrictions in states are an overreaction and have demanded governors reopen their economies. Democratic governors had requested the Trump administration remind Americans of the guidelines due to these demonstrations.  Trump asks Dr Deborah Birx, one of the taskforce experts, if there is a good chance that Covid-19 won't come back at all. Birx instead says it'll be easier to find it if it does. ""I think we are assured that the CDC is putting in place today what we are going to need in the fall so that we can stay in containment if, potentially, the virus comes back,"" she says. ""We're hoping that the flu infections also go down because people are much more aware of respiratory illnesses and how to protect themselves."" Trump says: ""And if it comes back, though, it won't be coming back in the form that it was. It will be coming back in smaller doses that we can contain. He says ""you could have some embers of corona"", but adds: ""We will not go through what we've been going through for the last two months."" ""It might not come back at all,"" he adds. Trump says recent comments from Centers for Disease Control (CDC) Director Dr Robert Redfield that a second Covid-19 wave could be even worse were ""inaccurate"". ""He was totally misquoted,"" Trump says. ""His whole purpose in making the statement was to get a flu shot."" Redfield joins Trump to clarify. He says he noted that next autumn ""could be more difficult, more complicated"" if influenza and Covid-19 were circulating at the same time. ""I think it's really important to emphasise what I didn't say,"" Redfield says. ""I didn't say this was going to be worse, I said it was going to be more difficult and potentially complicated. ""The issue that I was talking about being more difficult is we're going to have two viruses circulating at the same time."" Redfield says he was accurately quoted in the Washington Post, but takes issue with the headline, âCDC director warns second wave of coronavirus is likely to be even more devastatingâ. Here's what Redfield is quoted as saying by the Post: âThereâs a possibility that the assault of the virus on our nation next winter will actually be even more difficult than the one we just went through. ""Weâre going to have the flu epidemic and the coronavirus epidemic at the same time.â Trump tweeted about this earlier: Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The president is joined by Robert Redfield, director of the Centers for Disease Control, Surgeon General Jerome Adams, Dr Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Dr Deborah Birx, Coronavirus Response Co-ordinator, and Vice-President Mike Pence, who leads the taskforce. As we wait for the delayed White House briefing, here's the latest from North America:  The US president and his Covid-19 task force are due to address the nation within the next few minutes. Mr Trump will probably be asked to comment on a senior government doctor who came forward today to claim he was sidelined for refusing to toe the political line. Dr Rick Bright says he had resisted efforts to promote hydroxychloroquine, a malaria medication touted by the president as a possible treatment for coronavirus. Â© 2025 BBC.
