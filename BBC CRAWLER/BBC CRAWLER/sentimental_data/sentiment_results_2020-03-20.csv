"Drinkers around England won't be able to prop up the bars at their regular haunts after Boris Johnson announced a nationwide lockdown. Despite the prime minster'splea for people not to enjoy ""one last pint""on Friday night, a few establishments reported an influx of customers before last orders. For others, a quiet week continued as it had started, and their final night of trading was marked by empty seats. Ryan North has ""a lot of beer to use up"" Ryan North, manager at city centre bar The Wardrobe, said staff had been ""in limbo"" since Monday. ""It's slowed right down since then when people came in for their last pint. ""Picture says it all really, no point in staying open, but we've got a lot of beer to use up."" Refurbishments and the ban have hit Daniel Force Daniel Force, barkeeper at the Brunswick Arms in Dawlish, said they had been closed for six weeks for a refurbishment. ""We tried to open up this week just to get some people through the door, and now we're being told we're closing tonight,"" he said. ""We even had a police officer come in to enforce the closure and make sure we close our doors at midnight."" ""It's going to be tough, but hopefully with everyone's help, we'll be able to knuckle through."" Birmingham ""Relief"" at certainty for The Loft The Loft, near the city's Hippodrome theatre, was empty on Friday evening. Owner Lawrence Barton said the chancellor's announcement had ""actually brought a sense of conclusion and relief"". ""I think the measures the Chancellor announced this evening are going to greatly help business and give us confidence we can support our workforce. ""We've been very concerned, the hospitality sector has been decimated, at least now it will give business owners the confidence to take the measure they need to secure as many jobs as possible.""

Tunbridge Wells A late storm before the calm in Kent Manager Anthony Price closed the doors of the Bedford pub in Tunbridge Wells at 20:00 GMT. Staff took over Â£500 in their last hour and were forced to turn away dozens of people shortly before closing, he said. The owners had considered closing earlier in the week, but had waited to receive the government order to close ""because we didn't know whether the insurance companies would cover us"". ""It was pay day for the staff today, so we wanted to make sure they got paid and made sure they were going to be alright for at least a month,"" he said. Mr Price expects the pub to be closed for 12 weeks, but said it was ""all up in the air"". Forcing pubs to close was the wrong decision, he said. ""I think the public are very resilient, especially the British, we are known for our stiff upper lip. I think, let the public decide what they want to do. ""If the older generation, the younger generation, they want to go to bars and restaurants, let them. At least give them the option. ""By me working, that's down to me, that's my risk. If the older generation want to come in for a beer, that's at their risk. ""I understand why they've done it and hopefully it brings a quicker resolution to the end of the virus, but I just think let people do what they want to do. It's locking people up for a minimum of 12 weeks, it is like prison. ""What you see on the news in other countries, you don't expect it to happen in England, you don't expect it to happen in Royal Tunbridge Wells."" Claire Brookes is using life savings while she waits for a lifeline Claire Brookes, landlady of the Walnut Tree Shades, is planning to use her life savings to pay her staff until government money comes through at the end of April. ""I signed a tenancy agreement for five years and have lots of plans but now I've been told I have to close my business. ""I want to believe what the government will do will be good but I will not get access to their money until the end of April. ""I'm looking at financial ruin because the only thing I can do to help my staff till the money comes through is to use my life savings."" James Winfield, of Frank's Bar in the city centre, said he was going to develop a takeaway business. Friday was his last night and he said he would be doing a lot of number-crunching over the weekend. ""I'm worried but full of hope so will be ordering food and drink for the new business while taking one day at a time,"" he said.

"Millions of workers are receiving a smaller pay packet as the economic realities of coronavirus bite. Struggling companies and self-employed workers have been offered financial help by the government, to help keep their businesses afloat and staff paid during the coronavirus outbreak. But, with millions on reduced wages, who is affected and what happens when workers fall ill? If you work in the private sector, and pay tax through the pay-as-you-earn (PAYE) system, your employer can put you on furlough - essentially, lay you off temporarily -by applying for a government grant,externalto pay 80% of your gross salary up to a limit of Â£2,500 per month. What does it mean if I've been furloughed by work? More than eight million workers have been furloughed since March, at a cost of billions of pounds to the government. Full and part-time employees are eligible, as are those on agency, flexible or zero-hour contracts. The typical full-time worker is paid Â£585 a week,external, about Â£2,340 a month, using a median average - the middle point of all workers. It has been hoped the grants, available through Revenue & Customs (HMRC) by the end of April, will stop big redundancy announcements. The money was backdated to March and the scheme will last until the end of October. New rules will apply over the summer that will see employers sharing some of the burden of these costs. Employers will be able to bring back furloughed employees part-time from July - although they will be expected to share the cost of paying people's salaries. An employer still pays their staff, and can decide whether to pay in full or only the 80% that has been covered. Ria Fortin only started her job as a coordinator with Morepour, a cellar and bar installation and maintenance company, four months ago. Now, she has been furloughed. ""There was an intake of breath when I was paid. It was not as much as I have been used to,"" says the 34-year-old, who has just bought a home with her self-employed partner. ""But it is a relief just to be paid. At least it is something. Other people are in a much worse situation."" Ria Fortin says she feels lucky to still have her job The company she works for is small, so she feels grateful to have been furloughed, rather than laid off, given that the hospitality industry may be one of the last to reopen. The couple have organised payment holidays on regular bills, but know these will eventually have to be paid, so Ria - a former NHS worker - says they are very conscious of budgeting. If you are self-employed and have had a loss of income,you can receive a taxable grantof 80% of your average monthly profits over the past three years - up to a cap of Â£2,500 per month. Initially, this has been available for three months in one lump-sum payment. A ""second and final"" payment, covering another three months and representing 70% of profits up to a cap of Â£2,190 a month will be available from August. You can access theCoronavirus Self-Employment Income Support Scheme (SEISS),externalas long as you traded in the past financial year, are still trading now and plan to continue doing so. Most of your income needs to come from self-employment and your average trading profit needs to have been less than Â£50,000 a year. If you became self-employed since April 2019, you will not receive any help under this scheme. This is because you haven't yet have filed a tax return, which is needed to help calculate financial support. HMRC will contact those who are eligible. You will have to try to claim benefits - such asuniversal credit,externaland/or contribution-basedemployment and support allowance (ESA),external. In his Budget, Chancellor Rishi Sunak said claimants could apply for ESA straight away, rather than waiting a week. He also temporarily removed the minimum income floor criteria for self-employed people - which looked at how much people could expect to earn in a month to calculate universal credit levels. Self-employed people not covered by the SEISS can now access universal credit in full, potentially allowing them to receivea payment equivalent to statutory sick pay (SSP). However, this does depend on your household's financial situation. If you are already in receipt of other benefits, these could stop when applying for universal credit, so it may be worth getting some advice. You can now apply on the phone or online, instead of having to attend a job centre. Benefit levels have also been increased temporarily. Rishi Sunak's 2020 budget speech in full,external What is universal credit? You should continue to work and have your wages paid as normal, even if you are home-working or have been told to work at another location temporarily. If you can work from home, you should do so. Working hours can still be clearly defined. Employers still have a duty of care and are responsible for any equipment they give you. The Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Servicehas set out guidance.,external If you are an employee, your employermust give you time off,externalin an emergency. But you might not get paid - it depends on the terms of your work contract. However, many bosses during this period are allowing parents to work flexibly, to try to manage both work and childcare. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? AVOIDING CONTACT:The rules on self-isolation and exercise HOPE AND LOSS:Your coronavirus stories LOOK-UP TOOL:Check cases in your area VIDEO:The 20-second hand wash If you are an employee, any sick pay you may receive will depend on where you work. Some workers' contracts offer full pay to those off ill - albeit for a limited time. If that time runs out, or if you don't get paid sick leave in the first place,you should receive SSP.,external The money - set at Â£95.85 a week - is paid by employers for up to 28 weeks. So if you are self-employed, you will not be eligible - but if you are a casual or agency worker, you will be. To receive SSP you need to be earning at least Â£120 a week.The ONS estimates,externalthere are 1,766,000 adult jobs in the UK that pay less than that amount - although some people will earn money from several jobs over the course of a week. SSP can now be claimed from a person's first day away from work, rather than the fourth day as before. Anyone claiming should be able to get a sick note from the NHS's 111 service rather than their GP. There have been concerns aboutwhether SSP is sufficient, especially for those who must self-isolate more than once following the introduction of the various test and trace systems.

"""It's like sleep mode"" was the way one Cabinet minister described the point of this significant intervention in the employment market. The idea here is to help employers put the workforce temporarily not needed in a sharp downturn into hibernation for when normality returns, not to fire them and do irreparable damage to the nation's productive capacity. This move is an incredible intervention for any British government, let alone a Conservative one, but proportionate to the size of the terrible but temporary economic impact that could follow the coronavirus shutdowns. Let's be clear, we are in a recession already, as is most of the coronavirus-afflicted developed world. The point of actions such as this is to prevent the permanent scars of depression. The seeds are there for a quick return to growth - all the same buildings and computer systems and networks and transport infrastructure are there, once this wretched pandemic passes, whether that is in six months or nine months or a year. In theory it should save hundreds of thousands of jobs. Perhaps many more. Coronavirus: Government to pay up to 80% of workers' wages Coronavirus: What are shops doing about stockpiling? Employers have to accept that the government is doing something they would have never imagined a UK government would do. At 80% of wages up to Â£2,500 a month it is a scheme more generous than some of the high welfare Scandinavian countries. It instantly transforms the social safety net of this nation. Weeks after Brexit, the UK does the most continental European-style economic intervention for decades. A massive support package that was the product of government negotiating in a small room with business groups and the unions. It shows that the Treasury does believe that the very sharp plunge in the size of the economy can be followed by a bounceback - but not if millions of people are scarred by unemployment. Economics shows that these can have long lasting impact. The chancellor was given the room for this partly by the Bank of England's biggest ever announcement of purchasing government debt. There are fiscal risks here if this pandemic lasts much longer than three months. But the risks of not acting were much greater. Indeed thousands of workers had already been fired. The Treasury scheme is designed to get those immediate economic victims of the crisis back in to their workforces. Business owners will then have to give them a leave of absence and receive taxpayer funding worth four-fifths of their salary. Such employees should be picking up the phone to their ex-bosses. There are gaps. The government is not saying there will be no pain. The self-employed still have it relatively tough, despite some changes to the benefit system. A delay to billions in VAT payments should also help things in the interim. But for those in jobs, or very recently fired, it requires employers to hold their nerve until the taxpayer payments begin at the end of next month. How do I get a food parcel?

"Digital marketing agency owner Cathy Wassell has been self-employed for 17 years Many self-employed people are struggling because work is being cancelled during the coronavirus outbreak, but are excluded fromfinancial measures announced by the UK government. ""It made me feel as if I wasn't of any importance,"" says Cathy Wassell, a freelance digital marketing agency owner based in Stratford-Upon-Avon who has run three businesses from home over the last 17 years. ""I watched the chancellor's speech but it was glaringly obvious that there was no help for self-employed people in those packages at all."" According to the Office for National Statistics, there are five million self-employed people in the UK, who make up 15% of the labour market. Many self-employed workers have told the BBC their income has dropped to zero, and they do not know how they will be able to pay their bills. ""We shortly will have no income and no way of protecting ourselves financially from the expenditures we still have to make,"" said Anneli Hukins, owner of Kent-based holistic health business Woodstock Holistics. ""I've been working as much as I can until I have to stop at the end of this week."" Ms Wassell, who runs the agency Socially Contented, said that one of her clients had lost three contracts worth about Â£300,000, and would be out of business by the end of March. Other clients were late to pay her, which meant she couldn't afford her own bills, including paying the freelancers she employs. Holistic health business owner Anneli Hukins will have to stop working to take care of her son, as schools are closing On Tuesday, UK Chancellor Rishi Sunak revealed a Â£350bn stimulus package to help firms to battle the impact of coronavirus, including Â£330bn of business loan guarantees. It also included aid to cover a business rates holiday and grants for retailers and pubs. However, many small businesses are run by the self-employed, working either remotely or from home, which means they cannot benefit from a business rates tax break because they don't have a premises. They are also not in favour of taking out loans to make ends meet. ""There's no way that I would take the loan,"" said Ms Hukins. ""If I'm going to be struggling to pay off my overdraft to continue to pay for my rent and bills, then there's no way I can keep up with the payments for the loan."" Coronavirus: A visual guide to the economic impact Welsh business fund to help self-employed 'There isn't time. Firms are closing now' Chancellor unveils Â£350bn lifeline for economy Calum Macnee is the owner of walking tour operator Stills & Hills in Edinburgh. His income is completely dependent on tourists, a source which has now ""disappeared"" for the foreseeable future. ""The only option on offer in the government package to replace that lost income, appears to be to borrow money and put myself in debt, which will then need paid off, if and when the work comes back,"" he said. ""I am reluctant to put myself at the mercy of the large financial institutions who seem to be the only ones guaranteed to benefit."" Self-employed walking tour operator Calum Macnee doesn't want to take on more debt Joanne Wilson is a self-employed nail technician in West Sussex and runs the business Miss Jo's Nail Co from her home. A millennial hoping to get onto the property ladder, Ms Wilson spent several years saving up for a house deposit. But due to the coronavirus outbreak, the 16 clients she typically serves a week dwindled to four, and from next week, she will have no work at all. ""It's looking like it's never going to happen for me to buy a house,"" she said. ""I have been in tears over the fact that I saved and saved and saved, and now I'm going to have to dive into my savings and live off it."" Joanne Wilson, owner of Miss Jo's Nail Co in West Sussex, despairs of ever being able to step onto the housing ladder The government has said it will make it ""quicker and easier"" for self-employed people affected by coronavirus to access benefits. The chancellor said that those on contributory employment and support allowance (ESA) will be able to claim from day one, instead of day eight. He is also temporarily removing the minimum income floor from universal credit. The minimum income floor would have taken into account how much someone would normally expect to earn in a month when calculating their entitlement to universal credit. The removal of the minimum income floor means more will be able to claim for time they spend off work due to sickness. But what happens if you're not sick? Ms Wilson is exasperated by the government policy: ""I'm not currently sick but I still can't work because of this situation. If you can't work, you can't work. What do you do?"" The Association of Independent Professionals and the Self-Employed (IPSE)has written to Prime Minister Boris Johnson,externaltogether with numerous other industry bodies, calling on the government to implement a temporary income protection fund specifically for the self-employed. According to the IPSE, prior to the coronavirus outbreak, self-employed people contributed Â£305bn to the British economy. The industry body says the coronavirus outbreak has caused ""an income crisis"" that cannot be fixed without help. Chancellor Rishi Sunak says those on contributory employment and support allowance (ESA) can claim from day one IPSE's policy director Andy Chamberlain told the BBC: ""Not only are self-employed people facing personal ruin, but their businesses are also likely to fail and this will have knock-on effects for the rest of the economy. ""We're very grateful for the measures the chancellor has already unveiled, however it is becoming increasingly clear that they will not go anywhere near far enough."" 'There isn't time.

"This video can not be played Nicola Sturgeon: ""Covid-19 is the biggest challenge of our lifetimes"" The Scottish people are facing the ""biggest challenge of our lifetimes"" in the fight against coronavirus, Nicola Sturgeon has warned. The first minister said there would be ""difficult days ahead"" as she confirmed compulsory closures of restaurants, cafes, pubs, gyms and cinemas. But she said the crisis would pass if people followed health advice and look out for each other. She spoke shortly afterBoris Johnson ramped up social distancing measures. He ordered pubs and restaurants to shut while the chancellor announced a raft ofnew financial measures to help businesses and employees. In her speech, Ms Sturgeon warned that the number of Covid-19 cases was ""set to rise sharply"". She urged people to follow social distancing advice to save lives and reduce pressure on the NHS. And she addressed grandparents and children directly in a moving message. ""To older people - we are asking you to stay away from your grandkids, from the people you love,"" she said. ""That's hard. ""But it is for your protection - so you can stay around to see them grow up. ""To children - I know this is a strange time. You're away from school, and won't be able to spend as much time with friends. ""The adults around you are probably feeling a bit anxious too. So help them. Follow their advice. Study and do your homework. But don't forget to have fun. And wash your hands."" The number of positive cases in Scotland has risen to 322, a rise of 56 from Thursday. The number of deaths remains at six. Ms Sturgeon added: ""This crisis is reminding us just how fragile our world is. But it is also reminding us what really matters - health, love, solidarity. ""With compassion and kindness - and with the dedication and expertise of our NHS - we can and we will get through this."" Ms Sturgeon earlier told a media briefing that she understood they were asking people to ""fundamentally change the way we live our lives"". She warned young people the advice to limit socialising ""is not optional"". And she was concerned that young people would be disappointed that they will not be able to meet friends over the weekend. ""But again I cannot be clearer,"" she said. ""Please do not think this advice just applies to other people and not to you."" The public have been asked to reduce social contact, work from home and stay away from crowded places. Those who are most vulnerable should stay at home as much as possible. The first minister said she understood people did not like to be told what to do by politicians. But she said: ""Believe me when I say this is vital. It is vital for your own protection, it is vital for the protection of your loved ones, particularly the older and more vulnerable people. ""It is vital for the protection of our NHS and its ability to care for those who will need it in the weeks to come.

The idea here is to help employers put the workforce temporarily not needed in a sharp downturn into hibernation for when normality returns, not to fire them and do irreparable damage to the nation's productive capacity. This move is an incredible intervention for any British government, let alone a Conservative one, but proportionate to the size of the terrible but temporary economic impact that could follow the coronavirus shutdowns. Let's be clear, we are in a recession already, as is most of the coronavirus-afflicted developed world. The point of actions such as this is to prevent the permanent scars of depression. The seeds are there for a quick return to growth - all the same buildings and computer systems and networks and transport infrastructure are there, once this wretched pandemic passes, whether that is in six months or nine months or a year. In theory it should save hundreds of thousands of jobs. Perhaps many more. Coronavirus: Government to pay up to 80% of workers' wages Coronavirus: What are shops doing about stockpiling? Employers have to accept that the government is doing something they would have never imagined a UK government would do. At 80% of wages up to Â£2,500 a month it is a scheme more generous than some of the high welfare Scandinavian countries. It instantly transforms the social safety net of this nation. Weeks after Brexit, the UK does the most continental European-style economic intervention for decades. A massive support package that was the product of government negotiating in a small room with business groups and the unions. It shows that the Treasury does believe that the very sharp plunge in the size of the economy can be followed by a bounceback - but not if millions of people are scarred by unemployment. Economics shows that these can have long lasting impact. The chancellor was given the room for this partly by the Bank of England's biggest ever announcement of purchasing government debt. There are fiscal risks here if this pandemic lasts much longer than three months. But the risks of not acting were much greater. Indeed thousands of workers had already been fired. The Treasury scheme is designed to get those immediate economic victims of the crisis back in to their workforces. Business owners will then have to give them a leave of absence and receive taxpayer funding worth four-fifths of their salary. Such employees should be picking up the phone to their ex-bosses. There are gaps. The government is not saying there will be no pain. The self-employed still have it relatively tough, despite some changes to the benefit system. A delay to billions in VAT payments should also help things in the interim. But for those in jobs, or very recently fired, it requires employers to hold their nerve until the taxpayer payments begin at the end of next month. How do I get a food parcel?

"Supermarkets have gone on a hiring spree as demand surges as a result of the coronavirus crisis. Tesco, Asda, Aldi, and Lidl said they would hire thousands of staff after hugely increased demand saw shoppers clearing shelves. That move came before the governmentsaid it would pay the wages of workers at firms affected by the pandemic. And Sainsbury's has asked shoppers to stay 1m away from shop staff if possible, to help keep them safe. Supermarkets have been overwhelmed by a wave of panic-buying as shoppers rush to stock up amid the coronavirus pandemic. Coronavirus: What are shops doing about stockpiling? Coronavirus: Online shopping website Ocado suspends service To combat the stockpiling, in recent days the major British supermarketsimposed limits on how much of each item shoppers can buy. Along with other measures to cope with the increased demand, some of the chains have embarked on big recruitment drives for a total of more than 30,000 jobs. People have been queuing outside supermarkets before they open their doors Tesco, the UK's biggest supermarket, wants to take on 20,000 temporary workers ""to help feed the nation"", it said. ""The Covid-19 pandemic has resulted in an unprecedented increase in demand for food and household products,"" the chain said. ""At Tesco, we're working around the clock to help ensure families have access to the shopping items they need. ""We launched our recruitment drive online on Wednesday and since then we have already been overwhelmed by support from the public and thank everyone who has applied to work with us in stores."" It added that ""over the coming days thousands of new colleagues will join us"". The chain also announced on Saturday it will give all its workers across stores, distribution centres and customer engagement centres a 10% bonus on their hourly rate until 1 May - backdated to 9 March. Frontline salaried managers will receive a 10% bonus on actual hours worked, it added. Asda said it wanted to recruit more than 5,000 temporary staff from among people whose jobs have been impacted by the virus. Aldi announced it was looking to fill 5,000 new temporary posts and take on 4,000 permanent new workers for jobs in all its stores and distribution centres. And Lidl said it would create about 2,500 temporary jobs across its 800 stores in the UK. The discounter said it was hiring to ""help with an extremely busy time for stores"". Lidl GB chief executive Christian Haertnagel said staff were doing an ""incredible job at keeping our shelves stocked, and serving communities during an extremely challenging period"". ""Temporarily expanding our teams is one way we can help support our colleagues and customers, whilst providing work to those that have had their employment affected by the current situation."" Earlier this week,Morrisons announced it was creating 3,500 new jobsto expand its home delivery service, about 2,500 pickers and drivers, plus 1,000 staff in its distribution centres. It said it would make more slots available and also set up a call centre for those without access to online shopping. Morrisons said the move would help ""at a time of national need"". Shoppers outside a Tesco in West London endeavour to follow social distancing measures As well as introducing social distancing measures, Sainsbury's CEO Mike Coupe said the store would prefer customers to pay with a card rather than cash. He also said Sainsbury's would be expanding its reserved 08:00-09:00 slot for elderly, disabled and vulnerable customers to NHS and social care workers. Consultant cardiologist Dr Lisa Anderson told BBC Radio 4's Today programme this would lead to cross-infection. She said: ""It's not just about the risk to ourselves and our family; we're travelling home on the Tube and on buses, we're cross-infecting everybody at the moment."" Former health secretary Jeremy Hunt told the programme he agreed the move by supermarkets could pose a risk. He said: ""We're going to have to learn as we go along about these unintended consequences."" On Friday, at his daily Downing Street briefing, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he would be chairing a meeting with supermarket bosses on Saturday to discuss the situation. In an environment that was already tough for the High Street due to higher costs and changes in shopping habits, the coronavirus crisis has added a huge burden for retailers as many people avoid their stores. Sir Philip Green's Arcadia retail group, which includes Topshop, Topman, Dorothy Perkins, and Miss Selfridge, said on Friday it was closing all its stores. The company said it would focus on its digital and social platforms. Staff were to remain employees and receive their full pay for March, but it was not clear what would happen with staffing beyond then. However, this news came before a massive UK intervention in which Chancellor Rishi Sunak will pay the wages of employees unable to work due to the coronavirus pandemic. The radical move is aimed at protecting people's jobs. A number of travel operators have outlined measures they have been forced to bring in, due to the outbreak: Holiday park operator Butlin's said it would have to lay off 10,000 seasonal workers if it did not get enough state aid to pay their wages. Owner Bourne Leisure, which owns 50 Butlin's, Haven and Warner parks has approached the government for help Hay's Travel, which took over Thomas Cook's shops, has cut 880 jobs out of a workforce of about 5,000 to reduce costs The Confederation of Passenger Transport, which represents bus companies including Arriva, FirstGroup, Go-Ahead, National Express, and Stagecoach, says ""tens of thousands"" of jobs could go within weeks However, all these warnings and job cuts were made before the latest government announcement - and it is now unclear whether those moves will still hold. As well as the wage payments, it is understood the government wage subsidy will apply to firms where bosses have already had to lay off workers due to the coronavirus, as long as they are brought back into the workforce and instead granted a leave of absence.

How to lift the mood during a period of anxiety? Some people in the UK have chosen to put up their Christmas lights.

Emma says: ""We don't have much control about what is going on outside of the house but we can control what is going on inside our house, so why not have some fun?"" Paul Burbidge-Grant, from Coventry, says he has received a great response to his Christmas lights display. The 38-year-old, who decorates the house each Christmas to raise money for charity, says: ""We looked out of the window the other day and saw how dark and gloomy the world was, so we wanted to light it up.""

As France spends its first Friday under a national lockdown, authorities have warned city dwellers to refrain from their traditional weekend escapes to the countryside. Such jaunts, national police head Jean-Paul Pecquet reminded citizens, were not among the exceptions to the travel restrictions. ""I urge people to be public spirited and responsible,""  he said. Police patrols are being stepped up at all Parisian railway stations from Friday to Sunday.  Those caught violating the lockdown will not be allowed to board trains and face fines of â¬135 (Â£122; $145). For the past week, all eyes have been on Alberta's top doctor, Dr Deena Hinshaw. The province's chief medical officer has been tasked with providing daily updates to the public on the spread of coronavirus, and the measures they should take to help flatten the curve. But people aren't just tuning in for her latest medical advice, they're also looking to her for her latest style. When she wore a dress decorated with the periodic table, the small boutique that made the frock was inundated with orders. Local media has praised her calm, but clear delivery of the grim 
statistics, and Albertans have taken to social media to praise her for 
providing a soothing scientific voice in the face of such uncertainty. She says this new-found status as fashion icon was never something she intended. âWhile Iâve never been known for my fashion sense â just ask my family â
 I believe anything that draws attention to COVID-19 is a positive,â Ms 
Hinshaw told the Globe and Mail in a statement. âI hope that everyone 
commenting on my clothing is also practising social distancing, 
regularly washing their hands and staying home if sick.â Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

This means they should stay at home unless they have an essential reason to go out. Non-essential businesses will be shut down, but people will still be allowed to go to grocery stores, pharmacies, gas stations and to take walks outside. Roads will remain open. âWe donât know yet all the steps weâre going to have to take to get this virus under control,""Governor J.B.

Tokyo 2020 is due to run in the Japanese capital from 24 July to 9 August Nic Coward, the chairman of UK Athletics, has suggested the Tokyo 2020 Olympics Games should be postponed because of the coronavirus crisis. Key qualifying events have been cancelled, while a number of athletes have criticised the organisers' stance to press ahead with plans to stage the Games.

Tom BatemanBBC News, Helsinki The UN's World Happiness Report says Finland is the happiest country on Earth for the third time running, which it links to its strong welfare state and high levels of public trust in government. Co-author and economics Professor Jeffrey Sachs believes that happiness will benefit Finland and the other Nordic countries in reacting to the crisis in the long term. ""As this crisis continues to unfold, we're going to need a lot of solidarity, a lot of redistribution of income, a lot of society pulling together, and places that can manage that are going to do better,"" he told the BBC. But thereâs still a lot of debate in Finland over whether or not the governmentâs response has been the right one, after it ran out of capacity to test for the virus. Finlandâs head of health security, Mika Salminen, responded by criticising the official WHO advice to governments, saying: ""We donât understand the WHOâs instructions for testing. We can't fully remove the disease from the world any more."" There are currenly 450 confirmed cases of coronavirus in Finland, with no deaths recorded so far. Katty KayWorld News America presenter In one short week, the US has gone from being the world's superpower to asking nurses to sew their own protective gowns and masks. In the early phases of this war, the country has failed miserably. Miserably. Doctors are terrified. They know hospitals are about to be hit by a tsunami of infected patients and they don't have enough equipment to treat them. They don't even have basic protective gear to keep their staff healthy. I lived here during 9/11. That was a huge shock to America's sense of security but the response was different. It was confident. Misguided, quite possibly, but confident. The country could respond with massive military force. Here a critical weakness at the heart of the American system has been exposed. Yet even now, there are glimmers of hope. Read more from Katty.

"Pupils whose exams were cancelled due to the coronavirus epidemic will be given grades estimated by their teachers, the government has said. The announcement comes as most UK schools closed their doors to a majority of pupils indefinitely in an effort to stem the spread of the virus. But many schools will re-open on Monday with a skeleton staff to accommodate the children of ""key workers"". There are concerns the hastily arranged system may struggle to cope. Teachers in England will look at coursework, mocks and other evidence from A-level and GCSE students and will award grades. And a process will be agreed with exam regulators and exam boards to see that pupils' ""hard work and dedication is rewarded and fairly recognised"". This video can not be played The government has closed all schools, but what does that mean for exams, and who can still go in? A similar process is likely to be followed in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. England's Education Secretary, Gavin Williamson, said cancelling exams was something no education secretary would ever want to do, but it was vital in these ""extraordinary times"". ""My priority now is to ensure no young person faces a barrier when it comes to moving onto the next stage of their lives - whether that's further or higher education, and apprenticeship of a job,"" he said. How long could schools be closed? When will the outbreak end? Pupils 'scared and anxious' The announcement came as hundreds of thousands of school pupils were saying sometimes tearful goodbyes to each other for possibly the last time. Pupils at the end of primary, GCSE and A-Level students do not know whether they will see their classmates again in school. Head teachers and local authority officials have been struggling to work out whose children they should be accommodating when schools partially re-open on Monday. Thegovernment has published a list of key workers,externalwhose children can still go to school if they cannot be looked after at home. These workers' jobs are considered ""critical"" for the response to the pandemic. The list has been separated into eight categories, including frontline health workers and social-care staff, nursery and teaching workers and those involved in food production and delivery. It also includes the police, those in key public services, transport workers and critical staff in financial services and utilities. Northern Ireland Education Minister Peter Weir has said all schools there should be prepared to cater for key workers' childrenafter they close on Monday. Anyone who thinks the emergency schools that are due to open on Monday will run like regular ones is wrong. They will instead comprise a patchwork of available teachers, support staff and pupils whose parents find themselves lucky enough to be on the key workers' list. They will not be following a specific curriculum, there will be no working towards exams and pupils are unlikely to be taught in their own year groups. How many pupils each school can accommodate will be a daily moving picture as staff fall ill. And head teachers will have to make some tough decisions about who can come into class - and sometimes their decisions will not be popular One spoke of arguing with a father who asked for a place because he worked in McDonald's; others in more obviously frontline jobs have also been disappointed. On the up side, the lucky ones may have a chance to learn in new and different ways, while their former classmates grapple with online learning from home. Nurseries, colleges and childminders are also closing their doors, though some are being asked to re-open to accommodate key workers' children. Vulnerable children, including those who have a social worker and those with special educational needs, will also be allowed to go to school. Dr Mary Bousted, joint-general secretary of the National Education Union, said: ""This is a very long list and could result in some schools having the majority of pupils attending."" She also called for education workers to be tested for Covid-19 to ensure safe working in schools. She added: ""There simply won't be enough education staff available for work on school sites if all members with symptoms are forced to self-isolate."" The government stressed that ""every child who can be safely cared for at home should be"" and asked workers to consult their employers to confirm whether ""their specific role is necessary"". The Department for Education said it would help local authorities identify those ""who most need support at this time"". The government has encouraged local authorities to keep residential special schools and specialist colleges open wherever possible. The full list includes: Frontline health workers, such asdoctorsandnurses Someteachersandsocial workers Those in key public services, including those essential to thejustice system, religious staff and public-service journalists Local and national government workersdeemed crucial to delivering essential public services Workers involved infood production, processing, distribution, sale and delivery Public-safety workers, includingpolice, armed forces personnel, firefighters and prison staff Essential air, water, road and railtransport workers Utilities, communication and financial services staff, includingpostal workersandwaste-disposal workers Locals find homes reduced to ash as fears grow of more fierce winds spreading LA fires Climate 'whiplash' linked to raging LA fires Watch: The moment five US presidents gather at Jimmy Carter's funeral The '9/11 mastermind' is set to plead guilty.

"The Dow Jones Industrial Average of 30 major American companies fell more than 4.5% on Friday, erasing all the gains it had made since Donald Trump became president in January 2017. The drop helped to finish the worst week on Wall Street since 2008, with all three indexes down at least 12%. The falls come as authorities tighten restrictions on activity in an effort to slow the spread of the coronavirus. New York state on Friday ordered non-essential businesses to close. Illinois also made a similar move, while California earlier mandated that its residents shelter in place. The Dow lost more than 900 points to close at 19,173, while the wider S&P 500 dropped 4.3% to 2,304 and the Nasdaq lost 3.8% to 6,879.5. They have now fallen more than 30% from their recent records. Mr Trump has taken credit as the share indexes climbed during his presidency - gaining nearly 50% as of last month. He has written about them on Twitter at least 131 times, according to a tally by the New York Times. At briefings this week, Mr Trump has said he is not worried about the economy in the long-run, arguing that business will bounce back after the pandemic eases and restrictions can be relaxed. For now, however, the upheavals are severe. Unemployment claims in the US surged 30% this week, as thousands of people lost their jobs, while in the restaurant industry alone as many as 7 million jobs could be cut in the next three months, according to estimates by the National Restaurant Association. Delta Air Lines on Friday said it would lose $10bn in its second quarter, while United Airlines warned that it would cut jobs starting in April if the government does not provide relief funding. Both firms saw share prices fall about 30% this week. Coca-Cola lost more than 8%, after warning the virus had upended its growth forecast, as sales to theatres, sporting venues and restaurants evaporate. Earlier, the FTSE 100 index of top UK firms ended up 0.76%, while Germany's Dax and France's CAC 40 gained more than 3%. The market moves came as the state of New York ordered staff at all ""non-essential"" businesses to remain at home as the number of coronavirus cases continues to rise. The move expands earlier restrictions and comes as California on the west coast said its nearly 40 million residents should ""shelter in place"". The US has confirmed more than 14,000 cases of the coronavirus, including more than 7,000 in New York. The surge has started to strain its health care system. ""This is the most drastic action we can take,"" New York Governor Andrew Cuomo said, New York said pharmacies, grocery stores, banks and shipping firms were among those exempt from the order, which goes into effect on Sunday. Many places have already been forced to shut, including schools, shopping centres, and theatres. Mr Cuomo also issued additional rules for the state's 19.5 million citizens, saying healthy people who are not at risk may go outside for exercise and to go grocery shopping, but should otherwise remain at home. Dr Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease, who has been a leader of the national response, said he supported the move. ""Please co-operate with your governor,"" he said at the White House's daily coronavirus briefing. The US also said it would bar non-essential travel between the US and Canada, from midnight. However, US President Donald Trump said he did not think shelter in place orders needed to be expanded nationally, noting that many states have far lower infection rates. ""They're watching it on television but they don't have the same problems,"" he said. Restrictions aimed at reducing the spread of the coronavirus have expanded rapidly this week and are already having a devastating economic effect, with the number of Americans seeking unemployment benefits surging more than 30% this week. Economists are predicting a sharp contraction in economic growth in coming months, and have warned that millions of jobs are at risk. Congress is working on a more than $1tn relief bill, that is expected to include direct payments of more than $1,000 for each American who earns less than a certain amount. It would also include millions for businesses affected by the pandemic, such as airlines and hotels.

"This video can not be played 60 days of coronavirus in the US - in 60 seconds A number of US states have ordered shutdowns with one in five Americans soon set to be under a ""stay at home"" order. Connecticut and New Jersey on Friday joined Illinois and California in ordering residents to stay at home in order to combat coronavirus. New York State ordered non-essential businesses to close. The virus has claimed nearly 230 lives in the US and infected more than 18,500 people. Globally more than 275,000 patients have tested positive for the respiratory illness and more than 11,000 have died. A ban on non-essential travel across the US-Canada border came into effect at midnight on Saturday. Speaking at the White House later in the day, President Donald Trump said governors, mayors and citizens were working with ""urgency and speed"" in what he described as a ""war against the virus"". Also at the news conference, Vice-President Mike Pence said he and his wife would be tested after one of his aides tested positive for the virus. ""Neither the president or I had direct contact"" with staffer, Mr Pence said, adding that the staffer was ""well"". On Friday Connecticut, Illinois and New York announced measures directing tens of millions of people to stay at home. The restrictions order most workplaces to close and require residents to remain inside except for trips to grocery stores, pharmacies and gas stations. In New York, Governor Andrew Cuomo restricted public gatherings and ordered all ""non-essential workers"" to stay at home. The measures come as confirmed coronavirus cases in New York reached 7,000 - the highest of any US state. ""These provisions will be enforced,"" Mr Cuomo told reporters. ""These are not helpful hints."" Late on Friday, President Trump declared a major disaster in New York State, a move that will release federal funding. What can West learn from Asia's coronavirus fight? Dow erases Trump presidency gains in virus sell-off New York and the neighbouring New Jersey, Connecticut and Pennsylvania also issued a joint order on Friday for the closure of all ""personal care"" businesses, such as hair and nail salons and piercing and tattoo parlours. All outdoor team sports such as basketball games are also banned under the measures, which take effect on Sunday night. On Thursday California Governor Gavin Newsom issued a similar order, telling all residents to stay at home. He estimated more than half of the 40 million people in his state would contract Covid-19 in just the next two months. Images from Los Angeles show some of the city's most famous landmarks completely deserted while the freeways are almost empty. Images from Los Angeles show some of the city's busiest spots left completely empty Illinois, whose biggest city is Chicago, has also ordered all residents indoors with exceptions to shop for food and medicine or take exercise. Nevada and Hawaii have also introduced tough new restrictions to reduce social contact. President Trump has so far ruled out any nationwide lockdown. He said on Friday: ""I don't think we'll ever find [a US shutdown] necessary"". He added that the US was ""winning"" the war against the virus. By Sophie Long, BBC News, Los Angeles These may be the most restrictive measures to be put in place in modern Californian history, but in Los Angeles life goes on and the streets are far from empty. In a city famous for its gridlocked rush-hour traffic, cars are moving more freely past the palm trees on Sunset Boulevard. In Hollywood cyclists still overtake joggers and families still go out for a stroll. But these could all be seen as essential excursions. People have been told that those who work in critical sectors should still go to work. Busses are still running and grocery stores, pharmacies and banks are all still open. But many people are staying at home and friends and neighbours are keeping their distance. Restaurants and bars closed their doors days ago, but now all gatherings outside the home have been banned and there is no indication when the restrictions will be lifted. Like a scene from a disaster movie, a road in Los Angeles is almost empty as the lockdown bites Venice Beach in Los Angeles on the first day of lockdown On Saturday, the US and Canada suspended all non-essential traffic across their shared border, which hundreds of thousands of people normally cross each day, for at least 30 days. The curbs took effect at midnight, the Canadian government said. President Donald Trump said on Friday: ""In normal times, these massive flows [of immigrants] place a vast burden on our healthcare system, but during a global pandemic, they threaten to create a perfect storm that would spread the infection to our border agents, migrants and to the public at large."" Acting Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf meanwhile said both sides wanted ""to make sure cargo continues, trade continues, healthcare workers continue to be able to traverse that border"". Similar restrictions have been put into place on the US's southern border with Mexico. Mexico's Foreign Secretary Marcelo Ebrard said that the measures would reduce the risk of the virus spreading further while not affecting economic activity between the two countries. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said US citizens should immediately return home unless they intend to remain abroad for some time.

On Friday, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said asylum seekers crossing into the country on foot from the US would be turned back as part of the border shutdown. Economic damage from the outbreak is also becoming clear  with more than 500,000 applications for unemployment benefits made this week compared to 27,000 in the same week last year. Air Canada has meanwhile announced plans to lay off 5,100 employees. The government has announced a C$82bn ($57bn, Â£49bn) financial package to boost the economy, more than a quarter of which will be used to directly support workers and businesses. In most provinces across the country, schools have been closed, as have public venues including bars, restaurants and cinemas. Restrictions on mass gatherings are in place. In the province of Ontario, public events of more than 50 people are banned. A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? YOUR THIRD HAND:How do you clean your smartphone?

A spokesperson for the Trump Organization would not confirm the mothballing of the resort, but told CNN: ""Various facilities are temporarily closed given local, state and federal mandates. ""We anxiously await the day when this pandemic is over and our world-class facilities can reopen."" Mr Trump's hotel in Las Vegas has already closed after coronavirus restrictions were introduced by the governor of Nevada. The president's hotels in New York and Washington DC remain open, though more than 200 staff have reportedly been laid off as their occupancy rate plunges amid the pandemic. The bar and restaurant of the Trump International Hotel in the nation's capital have shut in response to a virus-containment directive from the city authorities.

"Fraudsters are reported to be selling counterfeit masks and hand sanitiser Councils are warning people to beware of scammers pretending to be health officials or offering to pick up food and medicines. Fraudsters are also selling counterfeit face masks and hand sanitisers, says the LGA, which speaks for councils in England and Wales. Hand sanitiser containing an ingredient banned for human use six years ago has been seized in Birmingham. The LGA is advising people not to accept help from cold-callers. This means being suspicious of anyone who offers help, either online or in person, the Local Government Association warned, after councils in Rochdale and south London received reports of attempted scams. In Lewisham, south London, Neighbourhood Watch reported cold-callers knocking at the doors of elderly people, saying they were from the health authority and were carrying out tests. EASY STEPS:How to keep safe A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? CONTAINMENT:What it means to self-isolate HEALTH MYTHS:The fake advice you should ignore MAPS AND CHARTS:Visual guide to the outbreak VIDEO:The 20-second hand wash And in Rochdale, there were reports of strangers offering to run errands for elderly and vulnerable people amid fears they are trying to obtain Pin numbers and money by saying they will pick up shopping. Others are trying to get into victims' houses. People who are self-isolating are particularly at risk, says the LGA. With residents across the UK organising help for vulnerable people, the Association says they will have the most impact by focusing on neighbours they know, making donations to food banks, or obtaining guidance from councils. The advice to anyone without help to obtain food or medicines is to contact their local authority. ""By tricking elderly and vulnerable people in self-isolation to part with their cash, fraudsters are playing roulette with the lives of those most at risk,"" said Simon Blackburn, chairman of the LGA's communities board. ""Keeping the elderly and those with underlying health conditions safe is every council's top priority and councils will do everything in their power to prosecute fraudsters and seek the toughest penalties for criminals taking advantage in this despicable way,"" he added. Action Fraud, which receives reports of fraudulent activity, says victims of online scams have lost Â£960,000 in 105 coronavirus-linked cases since the beginning of February. This is likely to be the tip of the iceberg as many smaller cases are never reported. Often they paid for mail-order sanitisation products which were never sent. The National Fraud Intelligence Bureau says it has recorded 200 cases of fraudulent emails being sent, which include scammers who: pretend to be from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention or World Health Organization, asking recipients to click a link to report active infections in their area offer links to a fake daily newsletter for Covid-19 updates offer fake insurance schemes and trading advice pretend to be from the government, offering tax refunds Trading standards officers in Birmingham have seized bottles of hand sanitiser containing an ingredient banned for human use years ago which were on sale for Â£5 a bottle. They claimed to contain an ingredient called glutural, which was banned for human use by the EU in 2014. Some bottles had no labelling at all. Glutural can be used in cleaning products and has previously been used by the NHS to clean surgical tools and surfaces.

"The man is being held ""in a specially cleaned"" cell at police HQ in Douglas A homeless man arrested for allegedly failing to self-isolate after arriving on the Isle of Man amid the coronavirus pandemic will not face prosecution, police have said. The 26-year-old handed himself in at police headquarters in Douglas on Thursday evening. He had been unable to find a place to self-isolate after arriving that morning, a police spokesman said. Not prosecuting was ""in the best interests of everyone"", he added. Emergency legislation requiring new arrivals to quarantine themselves for 14 days means those who refuse could face a fine of up to Â£10,000 or three months in prison. Police said the man had been ""detained for his safety and the safety of the public"" and accommodation where he could self-isolate had now been found. He was not presenting any symptoms of the virus. The island's emergency legal powers came into effect at 23:59 GMT on Tuesday.

However, the show will ""honour the songs and artists"" that were due to take part of the contest  this May. ""With that in mind,"" organisers said, ""this year's songs will not be eligible to compete when the contest returns."" ""Participating broadcasters may decided which artist(s) to send in 2021, either this year's or a newly chosen one."" Georgia, the Netherlands, Spain and Azerbaijan have already confirmed their artists will return next year. There has been no indication on whether the UK's entrant, James Newman, will get a second chance. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

It's the first time that Eurovision has not taken place since it first aired in 1956. The 2020 contest would have seen performers from 41 countries gather with 16,000 fans at Rotterdam's Ahoy Arena to compete for the songwriting trophy. But after the Dutch government banned large public gatherings, the European Broadcasting Union called off the event to protect the ""health of artists, staff, fans and visitors"". Eurovision Song Contest cancelled over coronavirus How does the UK's Eurovision entry stack up? Five lessons from Eurovision 2019 The event's executive supervisor, Jon Ola Sand, added: ""We are very proud of the Eurovision Song Contest, that for 64 years has united people all around Europe. ""We regret this situation very much,"" he added, but promised the event would return ""stronger than ever"" next year, preferably in the Netherlands, which won the contest in 2019. James Newman was due to represent the UK at the contest Newman, said he was ""gutted not to be going to Rotterdam"" but recognised it was ""more important for everyone to remain safe during these unprecedented times"". Russia's Little Big, whose song Uno was considered a front-runner at the contest,shared a similar sentiment on Facebook,external, writing: ""We regret about it and we also assume that this is the only proper decision in such a situation."" The decision to stage an alternative event came just 48 hours after Eurovision was called off, and was prompted by the ""overwhelming"" response of fans. ""The EBU is very aware of how much the Eurovision Song Contest will be missed,"" organisers explained. ""The contest's values of universality and inclusivity, and our proud tradition of celebrating diversity through music, are needed more than ever right now."" They said they hoped the alternative programme would ""help unite ands entertain artists around Europe at this challenging time"".

"This video can not be played California governor: ""We need to make tough decisions"" California has issued a ""stay at home"" order to residents as it tries to stem the march of the coronavirus across the most populous US state. Governor Gavin Newsom told Californians they should only leave their homes when necessary during the pandemic. He earlier estimated more than half of the 40 million people in his state would contract Covid-19 in just the next two months. The virus has claimed 205 lives in the US and infected more than 14,000. Globally nearly 250,000 patients have tested positive for the respiratory illness and more than 10,000 have died. California's mandate is the most drastic step taken by a US state to combat Covid-19. Live updates as the US warns against international travel On Friday, New York State also escalated containment efforts, ordering all non-essential employees to work from home, barring evictions and issuing social distancing rules for citizens. Mr Newsom said on Thursday evening: ""This is a moment we need to make tough decisions. We need to recognise reality."" The governor did not offer an end date to the order in his address, though he noted this is ""not a permanent state, this is a moment in time"". ""We will look back at these decisions as pivotal."" California is among the first US states to bring in blanket restrictions. Earlier this week Nevada said non-essential businesses should close for 30 days. The governor's order will allow residents to leave their homes to buy groceries or medicine, or walk a dog or take exercise, but seeks to limit public interactions. It will force businesses deemed non-essential to close, while allowing others including grocery stores, pharmacies, banks and petrol stations to stay open. About half of the state's population is already subject to similar stringent measures, including the city of San Francisco. This video can not be played Students on spring break defy Covid-19 warnings The Democratic governor said parts of the state were seeing infection rates double every four days. Speaking at a press conference in Sacramento, Mr Newsom said the virus ""will impact about 56% of us - you do the math in the state of California, that's a particularly large number"". The governor did not clarify how his officials had calculated that figure, which would amount to nearly 22.5 million infected people. But his spokesman acknowledged the estimate did not take into account the mitigation measures being implemented state-wide. Police have said they will take a soft approach to enforcing the order.A number of local departments told US media,externalthey will not arrest individuals ignoring the policy - though violating it can lead to a citation - and hope issuing warnings will keep people at home. David Willis in Los Angeles reports This is the most drastic measure that any US state governor has taken to try to tame the virus - going further even  than New York, which has more coronavirus cases than California. Speaking from the state's emergency operations centre in Sacramento - a place that is normally used to coordinate the response to wildfires or earthquakes - Mr Newsom called on people here to only leave their homes if it was absolutely necessary - to get food, collect medicines, or care for a friend or relative. He said said that based on projections nearly 20,000 more hospital beds would be needed to deal with the effects of the outbreak than the state could currently provide. He is asking Congress for a billion dollars in federal funding to support California's response to the crisis, and calling for a navy hospital ship to be deployed to the Port of Los Angeles to help deal with the anticipated surge in patients. So far, California has recorded fewer than 1,000 cases of the virus and 19 deaths, according to the Los Angeles Times. On Wednesday Mr Newsom wrote to President Donald Trump appealing for urgent federal help. On Thursday Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin said the Senate needed to pass a $1 trillion economic rescue plan by Monday. The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act would include hundreds of billions of dollars worth of loans to big corporations and small businesses, large corporate tax cuts and $1,200 (Â£1,000) cheques for taxpayers. A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? YOUR THIRD HAND:How do you clean your smartphone? BORED KIDS:Should you let your children play with others? GETTING READY:How prepared is the US? DOING GOOD:Kind Canadians start 'caremongering' trend Along with New York and Washington, California is among the US states worst hit by the coronavirus pandemic. On Thursday alone, New York City's recorded caseload of Covid-19 more than doubled to 3,954 - greater than the confirmed number of coronavirus patients in the whole of the UK. New York Governor Andrew Cuomo has escalated containment efforts by mandating all non-essential workers to stay at home as cases continue to rise in the state. He has also ordered a moratorium on all residential and commercial evictions for the next 90 days. ""Sixteen days ago, we were at zero [cases]. Today we are at 2,900. Those numbers are why we're taking these actions."" Mr Cuomo has also issued additional rules for citizens. Vulnerable individuals should only go outside for solitary exercise, avoid public transport, and wear masks. Non-vulnerable groups are barred from non-essential gatherings outside of private homes, including group exercise, and must practice social distancing of at least six feet (2m). ""This is not life as usual,"" the governor said. ""Accept it and realise it and deal with it."" He noted the new rules, which go into effect Sunday, will be enforced through a civil fine and mandatory closure for any businesses not in compliance with this guidance. But Mr Cuomo said he would not call it a shelter-in-place order. The governor is also speaking with leaders of bordering states to take regional action. The governor noted the surge in New York coronavirus cases was due to increased testing capability and that the state was testing more people per capita than China or South Korea, with 10,000 tests processed last night. New York Mayor Bill de Blasio told CNN the most populous city in the US would run out of medical supplies within three weeks if the ""explosion"" of infections continued at such a rate. He implored the federal government to help New York obtain 15,000 ventilators, three million respirator masks, 50 million surgical masks and 45 million gowns, gloves and coveralls. The mayor said the virus had so far claimed the lives of 26 people in the city. A nearly empty baggage claim area at McCarran International Airport in Las Vegas, Nevada The US Department of State, meanwhile, on Thursday urged Americans to forgo all foreign travel. In an effort to contain the global coronavirus pandemic, the nation's foreign ministry issued a Level 4 travel advisory - its top-tier warning, usually reserved for nations at war - that said ""do not travel"". Only four days ago the department sent out a Level 3 notification recommending that Americans ""reconsider travel"". The latest warning said: ""If you choose to travel internationally, your travel plans may be severely disrupted, and you may be forced to remain outside of the United States for an indefinite timeframe."" US President Donald Trump said on Thursday his administration was working with the military to bring home hundreds of Americans who have been stranded overseas amid a global shutdown on international travel. President Trump is also expected to announce plans on Friday to temporarily close the country's southern border with Mexico, according to US media. The arrangement would be similar to the closure of the Canadian border, including exemptions for essential workers and trade. The White House has also cancelled this year's meeting of G7 leaders in the US. This video can not be played Covid symptoms: What are they and how long should I self-isolate for? The annual meeting of the world's seven most powerful economic countries was due to be held in June at the Camp David presidential retreat in the US state of Maryland. But the leaders of the US, Britain, Italy, Japan, Canada, France, Germany and the EU will instead speak via video conference. White House spokesman Judd Deere said the decision was taken ""in order for each country to focus all of its resources on responding to the health and economic challenges of Covid-19"". A series of other high-profile events, from sports tournaments to music festivals, have been cancelled around the world this month because of the coronavirus pandemic.

"The man is being held ""in a specially cleaned"" cell at police HQ in Douglas A homeless man arrested for allegedly failing to self-isolate after arriving on the Isle of Man amid the coronavirus pandemic will not face prosecution, police have said. The 26-year-old handed himself in at police headquarters in Douglas on Thursday evening. He had been unable to find a place to self-isolate after arriving that morning, a police spokesman said. Not prosecuting was ""in the best interests of everyone"", he added. Emergency legislation requiring new arrivals to quarantine themselves for 14 days means those who refuse could face a fine of up to Â£10,000 or three months in prison. Police said the man had been ""detained for his safety and the safety of the public"" and accommodation where he could self-isolate had now been found. He was not presenting any symptoms of the virus. The island's emergency legal powers came into effect at 23:59 GMT on Tuesday.

"Supermarkets have gone on a hiring spree as demand surges as a result of the coronavirus crisis. Tesco, Asda, Aldi, and Lidl said they would hire thousands of staff after hugely increased demand saw shoppers clearing shelves. That move came before the governmentsaid it would pay the wages of workers at firms affected by the pandemic. And Sainsbury's has asked shoppers to stay 1m away from shop staff if possible, to help keep them safe. Supermarkets have been overwhelmed by a wave of panic-buying as shoppers rush to stock up amid the coronavirus pandemic. Coronavirus: What are shops doing about stockpiling? Coronavirus: Online shopping website Ocado suspends service To combat the stockpiling, in recent days the major British supermarketsimposed limits on how much of each item shoppers can buy. Along with other measures to cope with the increased demand, some of the chains have embarked on big recruitment drives for a total of more than 30,000 jobs. People have been queuing outside supermarkets before they open their doors Tesco, the UK's biggest supermarket, wants to take on 20,000 temporary workers ""to help feed the nation"", it said. ""The Covid-19 pandemic has resulted in an unprecedented increase in demand for food and household products,"" the chain said. ""At Tesco, we're working around the clock to help ensure families have access to the shopping items they need. ""We launched our recruitment drive online on Wednesday and since then we have already been overwhelmed by support from the public and thank everyone who has applied to work with us in stores."" It added that ""over the coming days thousands of new colleagues will join us"". The chain also announced on Saturday it will give all its workers across stores, distribution centres and customer engagement centres a 10% bonus on their hourly rate until 1 May - backdated to 9 March. Frontline salaried managers will receive a 10% bonus on actual hours worked, it added. Asda said it wanted to recruit more than 5,000 temporary staff from among people whose jobs have been impacted by the virus. Aldi announced it was looking to fill 5,000 new temporary posts and take on 4,000 permanent new workers for jobs in all its stores and distribution centres. And Lidl said it would create about 2,500 temporary jobs across its 800 stores in the UK. The discounter said it was hiring to ""help with an extremely busy time for stores"". Lidl GB chief executive Christian Haertnagel said staff were doing an ""incredible job at keeping our shelves stocked, and serving communities during an extremely challenging period"". ""Temporarily expanding our teams is one way we can help support our colleagues and customers, whilst providing work to those that have had their employment affected by the current situation."" Earlier this week,Morrisons announced it was creating 3,500 new jobsto expand its home delivery service, about 2,500 pickers and drivers, plus 1,000 staff in its distribution centres. It said it would make more slots available and also set up a call centre for those without access to online shopping. Morrisons said the move would help ""at a time of national need"". Shoppers outside a Tesco in West London endeavour to follow social distancing measures As well as introducing social distancing measures, Sainsbury's CEO Mike Coupe said the store would prefer customers to pay with a card rather than cash. He also said Sainsbury's would be expanding its reserved 08:00-09:00 slot for elderly, disabled and vulnerable customers to NHS and social care workers. Consultant cardiologist Dr Lisa Anderson told BBC Radio 4's Today programme this would lead to cross-infection. She said: ""It's not just about the risk to ourselves and our family; we're travelling home on the Tube and on buses, we're cross-infecting everybody at the moment."" Former health secretary Jeremy Hunt told the programme he agreed the move by supermarkets could pose a risk. He said: ""We're going to have to learn as we go along about these unintended consequences."" On Friday, at his daily Downing Street briefing, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he would be chairing a meeting with supermarket bosses on Saturday to discuss the situation. In an environment that was already tough for the High Street due to higher costs and changes in shopping habits, the coronavirus crisis has added a huge burden for retailers as many people avoid their stores. Sir Philip Green's Arcadia retail group, which includes Topshop, Topman, Dorothy Perkins, and Miss Selfridge, said on Friday it was closing all its stores. The company said it would focus on its digital and social platforms. Staff were to remain employees and receive their full pay for March, but it was not clear what would happen with staffing beyond then. However, this news came before a massive UK intervention in which Chancellor Rishi Sunak will pay the wages of employees unable to work due to the coronavirus pandemic. The radical move is aimed at protecting people's jobs. A number of travel operators have outlined measures they have been forced to bring in, due to the outbreak: Holiday park operator Butlin's said it would have to lay off 10,000 seasonal workers if it did not get enough state aid to pay their wages. Owner Bourne Leisure, which owns 50 Butlin's, Haven and Warner parks has approached the government for help Hay's Travel, which took over Thomas Cook's shops, has cut 880 jobs out of a workforce of about 5,000 to reduce costs The Confederation of Passenger Transport, which represents bus companies including Arriva, FirstGroup, Go-Ahead, National Express, and Stagecoach, says ""tens of thousands"" of jobs could go within weeks However, all these warnings and job cuts were made before the latest government announcement - and it is now unclear whether those moves will still hold. As well as the wage payments, it is understood the government wage subsidy will apply to firms where bosses have already had to lay off workers due to the coronavirus, as long as they are brought back into the workforce and instead granted a leave of absence.

They have yet to confirm whether entrants will be compensated in future. As coronavirus continues to spread, the BBC has been receiving questions about how safe or unsafe certain modes of transport are. For example, it's a common belief that you are more likely to become ill on an aeroplane, because you're breathing ""stale"" air, but some scientists have actually said that the air on an aircraft may well be of better quality than on a train or a bus, because the air is being changed at a faster rate. So what are the risks?You can find more details here. And as a reminder, the government has advised against all non-essential travel. Here's some more on precisely what the chancellor said earlier today. Rishi Sunak outlined: ""We're setting up a new coronavirus job retention scheme. Every employer in the country will be eligible. ""Government grants will cover 80% of the salary of retained workers, up to a total of Â£2,500 per month, just above the median income. ""That means workers in any part of the UK can retain their job even if their employee can not afford to pay them, and be paid at least 80% of their salary. ""The scheme will cover the cost of wages backdated to 1 March and will be open initially for at least three months. I will extend the scheme for longer if necessary."" More details on the government's plans can be found here. We ""respect and agree with the government's decision"", says one pub in East London, as they close for the first time in 12 years.

"John McDonnell: Plans still represent significant wage cut Labour has urged ministers to go ""further and faster"" to help those affected by the coronavirus pandemic. Unions have welcomed the government's emergency financial support package for workers, announced earlier by the chancellor. And business group UK Hospitality said the move could potentially save up to a million jobs. But shadow chancellor John McDonnell said cash must be available now and not subject to ""weeks of delays"". Labour had been calling for the government to intervene to pay the wages of those unable to work due to school closures and other disruptions and those at most risk of redundancy - to a level of up to 90% of monthly earnings. Chancellor Rishi Sunak said the government would subsidise the monthly salaries of employees unable to work as part of an ""unprecedented"" package of measures to help protect people's jobs. UK to pay wages for workers facing job losses State should pay most at-risk workers - Labour Speaking at a press conference in Downing Street, in which he also announced increases to certain benefits, he said he understood the fear of not being able to pay bills and promised workers ""you will not face this alone"". Leading trade unions, who were consulted about the plans in advance, said they represented a huge step forward in stopping millions of low-paid workers falling into hardship. ""Securing jobs through government underwriting of wages is hugely welcome, and thatâs what we've been calling for action on,"" said the GMB's general secretary Tim Roache. âThis gives businesses and workers enhanced security and will help us recover in the long term."" He called on employers to pay the remaining 20% to ensure people were not left any worse off. The GMB union said the plan to pay 80% of wages for employees not working, up to Â£2,500 a month, was ""hugely welcome"". The government's announcement was welcomed by leading Labour figures, such as Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham and former leader Ed Miliband. London mayor Sadiq Khan has said he was ""concerned about the ability of the NHS to cope"" if the number of coronavirus cases increases as expected. Referring to the ""huge increase"" in the number of people in the capital city contracting the virus, he urged Londoners to ""please stay at home"" or risk their own health and the lives of the vulnerable.

"This video can not be played The chancellor says his 2020 Budget offers the âlargest sustained fiscal boost for nearly 30 yearsâ Chancellor Rishi Sunak has unveiled a Â£30bn package to boost the economy and get the country through the coronavirus outbreak. He is suspending business rates for many firms in England, extending sick pay and boosting NHS funding. In his first Budget speech, he warned of a ""significant"" but temporary disruption to the UK economy but vowed: ""We will get through this together."" The Bank of England hasannounced an emergency cut in interest rates. Mr Sunak, who was promoted to chancellor just four weeks ago after Sajid Javid quit the government, has had to hastily re-write the government's financial plans to deal with coronavirus. ""We are doing everything we can to keep this country and our people healthy and financially secure,"" he told MPs. Of the Â£30bn in extra spending, Â£12bn will be specifically targeted at coronavirus measures, including at least Â£5bn for the NHS in England and Â£7bn for business and workers across the UK. This is on top of other spending pledges that will amount to Â£18bn next year, and even more in following years. The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) said extra spending on government departments and investment represented the biggest Budget ""giveaway"" since 1992, and will add around Â£100bn to public borrowing by 2024. At-a-glance summary: Budget key points Kuenssberg: The chancellor's very large cheque book Richer or poorer? Ask the calculator McDonnell criticises Budget over social care Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said he welcomed many of the measures to ""head off the impact"" of coronavirus, whichhas now been labelled a pandemicby the World Health Organization. But he said the extra money for the NHS was ""too little, too late"" and the UK was going into the crisis with its public services ""on their knees"" after years of Conservative cuts. Measures to mitigate the effect of the coronavirus outbreak include: Statutorysick pay for ""all those who are advised to self-isolate""even if they have not displayed symptoms Business rates for shops, cinemas, restaurants and music venues in England with a rateable value below Â£51,000suspended for a year A Â£500m ""hardship fund"" to be given to local authorities in England to help vulnerable people in their areas A ""temporary coronavirus business interruption loan scheme"" for banks to offer loans of up to Â£1.2m to support small and medium-sized businesses The government will meet costs for businesses with fewer than 250 employees of providing statutory sick pay to those off work because of coronavirus Plans to make it quicker and easier to get benefits for those on zero hours contracts Benefit claimants who have been advised to stay at home will not have to physically attend job centres The number of coronavirus cases in the UKreached 460 on Wednesday, with an eighth person confirmed to have died after contracting the virus. The chancellor said that without accounting for the impact of coronavirus, the Office for Budget Responsibility has forecast growth of 1.1% in 2020, the slowest rate since 2009.

PUBLIC TRANSPORT:What's the risk? Despite speculation that he would ditch the framework on spending set by predecessor Mr Javid, Mr Sunak said his Budget is delivered ""not just within the fiscal rules of the manifesto but with room to spare"". The chancellor has scrapped a planned cut in corporation tax and scaled back a tax break for entrepreneurs, saving Â£6bn over the next five years. The spending in this Budget is being largely paid for with a big increase in government borrowing. The government expects to borrow almost Â£100bn more in this Parliament (before mid-2024) than was expected the last time we had any forecasts. And that figure does not include Â£12bn to be spent on getting the economy through the coronavirus outbreak. The Treasury documents say that money will be accounted for in the next Budget in the autumn. Islam: The chancellor's two Budgets Borrowing surge to fund 'significant' spending plans Budget gets mixed reaction on green issues Chancellor pledges big increase to research spend In other Budget measures, the chancellor announced that fuel duty would be frozen for another year. A planned increase in spirits duty will be cancelled andduties for cider and wine drinkers in England will be frozen as well, but a packet of 20 cigarettes will cost 27p more. The so-calledtampon tax will be abolished,and VAT on books, newspapers, magazines and academic journalswill be scrapped from 1 December. And the chancellorpledged to more than doublespending on UK government research and development by 2024. This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn: Talk of ""levelling up"" a ""cruel joke"" The chancellorannounced more than Â£600bn for road, rail, housing and broadband projectsover five years, aimed at delivering on the Conservatives' election promise to boost economic growth outside of London and the south-east of England. He announced plans for Treasury offices in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland and a ""new economic campus in the north, with over 750 staff from the Treasury"". He also promised an additional Â£640m for the Scottish government,Â£360m for the Welsh government,Â£210m for the Northern Ireland executiveand Â£240m for new city and growth deals. Call for clarity on coronavirus fund for Scotland Mr Sunak said he was providing Â£200m for local communities in England to build flood resilience and would double investment in flood defences. The chancellor will deliver another Budget in the Autumn, with measures aimed at preparing the UK economy for post-Brexit trading arrangements with the EU. Figures released by the Office for National Statistics found that the UK economy did not grow at all in January. What questions do you have about the budget?

"Millions of workers are receiving a smaller pay packet as the economic realities of coronavirus bite. Struggling companies and self-employed workers have been offered financial help by the government, to help keep their businesses afloat and staff paid during the coronavirus outbreak. But, with millions on reduced wages, who is affected and what happens when workers fall ill? If you work in the private sector, and pay tax through the pay-as-you-earn (PAYE) system, your employer can put you on furlough - essentially, lay you off temporarily -by applying for a government grant,externalto pay 80% of your gross salary up to a limit of Â£2,500 per month. What does it mean if I've been furloughed by work? More than eight million workers have been furloughed since March, at a cost of billions of pounds to the government. Full and part-time employees are eligible, as are those on agency, flexible or zero-hour contracts. The typical full-time worker is paid Â£585 a week,external, about Â£2,340 a month, using a median average - the middle point of all workers. It has been hoped the grants, available through Revenue & Customs (HMRC) by the end of April, will stop big redundancy announcements. The money was backdated to March and the scheme will last until the end of October. New rules will apply over the summer that will see employers sharing some of the burden of these costs. Employers will be able to bring back furloughed employees part-time from July - although they will be expected to share the cost of paying people's salaries. An employer still pays their staff, and can decide whether to pay in full or only the 80% that has been covered. Ria Fortin only started her job as a coordinator with Morepour, a cellar and bar installation and maintenance company, four months ago. Now, she has been furloughed. ""There was an intake of breath when I was paid. It was not as much as I have been used to,"" says the 34-year-old, who has just bought a home with her self-employed partner. ""But it is a relief just to be paid. At least it is something. Other people are in a much worse situation."" Ria Fortin says she feels lucky to still have her job The company she works for is small, so she feels grateful to have been furloughed, rather than laid off, given that the hospitality industry may be one of the last to reopen. The couple have organised payment holidays on regular bills, but know these will eventually have to be paid, so Ria - a former NHS worker - says they are very conscious of budgeting. If you are self-employed and have had a loss of income,you can receive a taxable grantof 80% of your average monthly profits over the past three years - up to a cap of Â£2,500 per month. Initially, this has been available for three months in one lump-sum payment. A ""second and final"" payment, covering another three months and representing 70% of profits up to a cap of Â£2,190 a month will be available from August. You can access theCoronavirus Self-Employment Income Support Scheme (SEISS),externalas long as you traded in the past financial year, are still trading now and plan to continue doing so. Most of your income needs to come from self-employment and your average trading profit needs to have been less than Â£50,000 a year. If you became self-employed since April 2019, you will not receive any help under this scheme. This is because you haven't yet have filed a tax return, which is needed to help calculate financial support. HMRC will contact those who are eligible. You will have to try to claim benefits - such asuniversal credit,externaland/or contribution-basedemployment and support allowance (ESA),external. In his Budget, Chancellor Rishi Sunak said claimants could apply for ESA straight away, rather than waiting a week. He also temporarily removed the minimum income floor criteria for self-employed people - which looked at how much people could expect to earn in a month to calculate universal credit levels. Self-employed people not covered by the SEISS can now access universal credit in full, potentially allowing them to receivea payment equivalent to statutory sick pay (SSP). However, this does depend on your household's financial situation. If you are already in receipt of other benefits, these could stop when applying for universal credit, so it may be worth getting some advice. You can now apply on the phone or online, instead of having to attend a job centre. Benefit levels have also been increased temporarily. Rishi Sunak's 2020 budget speech in full,external What is universal credit? You should continue to work and have your wages paid as normal, even if you are home-working or have been told to work at another location temporarily. If you can work from home, you should do so. Working hours can still be clearly defined. Employers still have a duty of care and are responsible for any equipment they give you. The Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Servicehas set out guidance.,external If you are an employee, your employermust give you time off,externalin an emergency. But you might not get paid - it depends on the terms of your work contract. However, many bosses during this period are allowing parents to work flexibly, to try to manage both work and childcare. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? AVOIDING CONTACT:The rules on self-isolation and exercise HOPE AND LOSS:Your coronavirus stories LOOK-UP TOOL:Check cases in your area VIDEO:The 20-second hand wash If you are an employee, any sick pay you may receive will depend on where you work. Some workers' contracts offer full pay to those off ill - albeit for a limited time. If that time runs out, or if you don't get paid sick leave in the first place,you should receive SSP.,external The money - set at Â£95.85 a week - is paid by employers for up to 28 weeks. So if you are self-employed, you will not be eligible - but if you are a casual or agency worker, you will be. To receive SSP you need to be earning at least Â£120 a week.The ONS estimates,externalthere are 1,766,000 adult jobs in the UK that pay less than that amount - although some people will earn money from several jobs over the course of a week. SSP can now be claimed from a person's first day away from work, rather than the fourth day as before. Anyone claiming should be able to get a sick note from the NHS's 111 service rather than their GP. There have been concerns aboutwhether SSP is sufficient, especially for those who must self-isolate more than once following the introduction of the various test and trace systems.

" What happens when everyday life suddenly changes? Additional reporting: Claudia La Via in Milan, and Sofia Bettiza “I don’t think it’s really hit me yet,” says Maria Vittoria Falchetti, who works for her family’s firm in the northern Italian town of Codogno, in the epicentre of the country’s brutal coronavirus epidemic. Her father Umberto, founder of a car components business, has become one of the casualties. The 86-year-old died in hospital from the virus, with the isolation rules not allowing his family to be with him. “I’m still in quarantine and working from home. But I dread the day when I go back to the office. “My office is next to his. He kept this little purse in his drawer and I used to hear every time he took out some coins. I knew he was going to get a coffee from the machine,” she says. “I will miss that noise.” The lack of noise can be deafening. Quiet streets, empty public transport, bars and restaurants that have closed, self-isolating families and locked-down cities have become part of the strange days of this Covid-19 pandemic. Private grief such as Maria Falchetti’s comes as public life seems to be falling apart. Maria Vittoria Falchetti If the world is holding its breath to see what happens next, Codogno, a small town in Lombardy, is a microcosm of how the virus can overrun a community - and how that community can fight back. One month ago, when coronavirus was first detected in the town, even the idea of locked-down towns guarded by police checkpoints would have seemed like something from a paranoid disaster movie. Two days after the outbreak was confirmed in Codogno, everyday, modern, globalised 21st-Century life in the town had come to a halt. From being a 1,000-year-old town with cafes and old churches, it became the place where “patient one” - the person at the start of a chain of contagion - was infected. People accustomed to going wherever they wanted found themselves ordered to stay behind a new frontier. They had become mask-wearing residents of a quarantined “red zone”, a firewall to stop the disease. One of the most surprising things was how quickly people adapted, says Roberto Cighetti, a science teacher in the town. “The priorities become clear - food, health, family. That’s it. You adapt in a moment,” he says. If Italy’s journey into Covid-19 is a few weeks in front of the UK’s, there are clues about the road ahead. Cighetti says panic buying was one of the first social symptoms of the epidemic. “It’s difficult to behave well under pressure,” he says. What stopped people hoarding food was when the supermarkets demonstrated there was no shortage - by constantly and visibly re-stocking shops. Once people were confident there were no problems with the food supply, the “panicking behaviour” stopped. Codogno, 11 March 2020 Codogno, 11 March 2020 The next social challenge was an eruption of fake news. WhatsApp groups were pinging with the spread of hoaxes, false cures and conspiracy theories. “There is an instinct to spread news without verifying it, so there were rumours that were totally fake,” says the science teacher. “They created anxiety and panic and lowered the level of trust.” Cighetti was so worried that misinformation was disrupting authentic public health advice that he took to social media with other scientists to try to counter the fake facts. Local people have suffered from an “epidemic of information”, he says, both useful and fake. That might be a by-product of another unwanted piece of history about this outbreak. As epidemiologist Professor David Heymann says, this is the first time that we’re within a pandemic that “we can follow in real-time”. There was also the social distancing to get used to - and that could have its own psychological isolation, says Cighetti. “The distance translates into an emotional distance.” The coronavirus has shown how vulnerable and fragile our interconnected world can suddenly become. But the same modern communications are keeping people together. There have been remarkable online eruptions of solidarity. Italy has had its own instant festivals of singing and music from balconies, with an opera singer delivering Puccini over the rooftops of Florence like some kind of epic soundtrack. Italians sing from their windows to boost morale Italians have also taken to raising an online glass to the friends they can’t see in person. The “aperitivo” after-work drink has switched to Instagram. In Paris, people stuck inside their homes are opening their windows for synchronised night-time rounds of applause for medical workers. This clapping and cheering, echoing around the empty streets, comes from thousands of people who are separated and together at the same time. In the UK, social media is being used to prepare for the storm ahead, sharing ideas to help the elderly or isolated. A Covid-19 Mutual Aid group is supporting hundreds of local efforts and neighbours have been signing up to WhatsApp groups to offer assistance. If the Italian experience is any guide, there will be mood changes in public responses to the coronavirus, with the seriousness not necessarily evident at first. At the start of Codogno’s strange new life of the lock down, Cighetti says it felt like a “boring holiday”. The schools had closed, the bars and restaurants had shut, streets were empty, no-one was able to travel. Codogno, 23 February 2020 Codogno, 23 February 2020 There were even positive sides. In the red zone, apart from those who were ill or self-isolating, people could move within the town and the enforced break meant “families spending more time together, walking, cycling, walking the dog, baking cakes,” says Cighetti. Pupils missed being at school and the science teacher says that when they had online lessons children actually seemed more engaged than usual, appreciating the return of normality. Roberto Cighetti But Covid-19 was stalking the town - and Cighetti says the rise in deaths and illnesses meant the atmosphere changed from complaining about disruptions to work and cancelled trips to something much darker. The isolation zones made grieving even more traumatic, with families unable to reach the funerals of even their closest relatives. A son couldn’t get to the funeral of a mother. By 13 March there had been 34 deaths in a town of only 16,000 people. There have been economic shockwaves too, rippling out from fears for restaurants in Codogno through to multi-nationals and tourist industries across northern Italy and beyond. According to the International Labour Organization the virus will destroy 25 million jobs worldwide. In the globalised supply chain, the disruption to local businesses can have international implications. The firm founded by Maria Vittoria Falchetti’s father produces electronics components for the car industry - and its shutdown threatened a domino effect, until an exception was made to allow production to resume. The Lombardy lockdown, seen as a draconian measure by international standards when it was introduced, appears to have succeeded in significantly reducing the number of new cases in Codogno. There is some light in sight. Local mayor Francesco Passerini said the town had given a “virtuous” example to the rest of the country. “It’s a war. But we have every possibility of winning. Unlike with our grandfathers who went physically into battle for our freedom, we are being required to show responsibility - responsibility and calm,” said the mayor. Radio Red Zone must be Europe’s only disease-fighting radio station. It is broadcasting from behind enemy lines in the battle against the virus, serving an audience in Codogno trapped inside the quarantine zone that gave the station its name. Its 83-year-old presenter, Pino Pagani, is there to reassure his neighbours and help them not to be panicked by the virus, even though he lost three of his friends in one week to the epidemic. “The worst thing is the fear. We are afraid of one another. The other day I met a person I knew who was crossing the street. I gave him a pat on the shoulder and he shied away frightened,” he says. Pino Pagani The Lombardy town of 16,000 people has found itself as the unexpected frontline of a pandemic. When they sent home their schoolchildren it was a local problem. A month later, half the world’s entire school population - about 850 million children - are out of school, according to Unesco, including now in the UK. The radio presenter says the station’s phone-ins and information lines are there to “keep people company” while ordinary life has been suspended. There are parents having to keep children occupied, people worried about their jobs and looking after their older relatives. “They ask for advice, they want to hear our voices. They think that if we are still going, everything will be fine. So they keep on calling us,” says Pagani. He gives the example of a listener concerned about having a high temperature, but who didn’t have a thermometer to check and didn’t want to go outside. “So we passed the call to the civil protection service and they immediately delivered a thermometer to her home. She was so relieved. “It’s also a way to solve very practical problems. We tell them which bakeries are open, what time the supermarkets close. People in need can rely on us to find help.” Among the biggest worries are about the elderly, in a country with one of Europe’s oldest populations. “My sons worry about me,” says Pagani, a widower. But he refuses to be anxious for himself. “My family don’t want me to leave the house. Whenever I go out, such as to present the show, my sons block the door and keep telling me, ‘Don’t do this, don’t do that’.” But he remains undeterred. “I’ve lived my life and endured a lot of hard times. I take care when I go outside, of course, but life must go on,” says the radio presenter. But these are strange times. One of those friends who died was a co-presenter on the radio show. “He was a close friend of mine, three months younger than me. We’ve known each other since kindergarten and we grew up together. The last time I spoke to him, he said he couldn’t come in because he wasn’t feeling well. “He said he had a temperature and he was worried about infecting us. I told him not to worry. He died last week and we couldn’t even go to the funeral because of the ban on public gatherings. “So we paid a tribute to him on the airwaves.”  They’re unlikely to want to put it on tourist posters, but Codogno has acquired the label the “Wuhan of Italy”, linking it to the Chinese city that saw the first cases of Covid-19 at the end of December 2019. Codogno is the first point in the detective story of how a virus from China reached Italy and began Europe’s most deadly outbreak. “You remember it clearly when you get shocking news,” says Cighetti. The science teacher was making an early morning wake-up cup of coffee when the news appeared on his mobile phone. The virus which had closed cities in China had appeared, as if from nowhere, on his doorstep. “It didn’t seem real,” he says. The attention of the world’s virus investigators swung to Codogno as a 38-year-old man had tested positive. The town was being described as the “ground zero” of the coronavirus. What made it even more alarming, says radio presenter Pagani, was that the first person to have coronavirus was “a real sporty type and healthy” and he had fallen seriously ill. The man, Mattia, is a manager for the Anglo-Dutch firm Unilever, a project leader for cleaning products. He had previously taken a course in hygiene at one of the firm’s UK bases. “Patient one”, as he became known, is a keen sportsman who belonged to a running club and socialised in the bars and restaurants. He worked for a global business with offices and production centres around the world. He is now recovering, but a chain of infections had followed him, among his family, friends, other people in the town and health workers and patients. While these circles widened, the urgent hunt was on to make a link with the outbreak in Wuhan. Italy had already stopped flights from China, but it hadn’t stopped the case in Codogno. An initial suspicion that Mattia had been infected from a friend who had been to China soon proved to be a false lead. His employers also told the BBC that he had not visited China. So how had Covid-19 reached Codogno? Professor Paul Kellam of Imperial College London is an expert on the genetics of viruses. His team delivered the genome analysis that helped to tackle a previous coronavirus outbreak, the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus, known as Mers. Each time a coronavirus moves from one person to the next, there is a slight genetic mutation, says Prof Kellam, allowing researchers to map its “family tree”. So when a version of the virus is analysed from any new location, it is possible to see how it compares with samples from the original outbreak in Wuhan, or its relationship to other offshoots of the virus in other countries. Researchers in Milan reportedthat the version of the coronavirus in Lombardy matched an outbreak in Germany, centred on a businessman from Munich who had met a woman from Shanghai carrying the virus. This would mean that while the Italian authorities were closing the air routes from China, the virus could have already arrived from Germany. There were questions about this interpretation - with the argument that even if the German and Italian versions of the virus were similar, they could both still independently have been the result of contacts with another separate source. Either way, there was another intriguing finding from the genetic analysis - that the virus had been circulating for several weeks before it was detected in Codogno. While “patient one” was being checked for any personal links to China, the coronavirus already had a head start and would have been moving quietly in the population. This is reflected in the observations of local people, including Pagani, who reported a number of unexplained and “quite weird” cases of a pneumonia-like illness before the first coronavirus was formally identified. Prof Kellam takes the origins of Covid-19 back a stage further. Such viruses originate from animals, with bats the most likely starting point. In the cases of other coronaviruses, such as Mers and Sars, the virus went from bats to other animals, before infecting humans. Even if there has been public shock at the impact of Covid-19, he says scientists have been “highly aware” of the potential for more viruses to cross over from animals. In the case of bats, it’s likely to be through droppings, saliva or urine. In March 2019, virus experts published what seemsremarkably prescient warning- that bat-borne coronaviruses “will re-emerge to cause the next disease outbreak. In this regard, China is a likely hotspot”. “The challenge is to predict when and where, so that we can try our best to prevent such outbreaks.” Perhaps more strikingly, the four scientists who wrote the paper were all based in the Institute of Virology in Wuhan. But there is another dimension to this. Coronaviruses, first identified in 1968, require the overlap of human life with animals - and this becomes ever more frequent as wildlife habitats are destroyed and wild animals are brought into closer contact with humans. This warning about the risk of infection from “human encroachment into natural spaces” isn’t a piece of environmental opportunism. It’s from the military technology agency of the US Department of Defense, which has been funding projects to tackle the threat of bat and other animal viruses. Months before the Wuhan outbreak, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) had highlighted the risk of a pandemic to the US population from infectious diseases from animals. It’s extraordinary to think that such a chain of events, with so much chaos and destruction, might have been caused by a single bat in China. While financial markets describe unpredictable disasters as “black swans”, the billions wiped off the value of shares could have started with a small bat.  “Right now, we feel like we are in the trenches - and we are all scared,” says Paolo Miranda, an intensive care nurse in the only hospital in Cremona. The hospital, about 28km (17 miles) from Codogno, is only treating patients with coronavirus and even then it can’t keep up with demand. A field hospital is being built outside, to add to the 600 patients already being looked after inside. “Everyone is calling us heroes, but I don’t feel like one,” says Miranda. Like many of his colleagues, he’s been working 12-hour shifts for the past month. “We are professionals, but we are getting exhausted.” Paolo Miranda Overwhelming demands are being placed on staff, as hospitals struggle with the scale of the pandemic. In the four weeks since the discovery of “patient one”, the number of cases in Italy has risen to over 41,000 cases and 3,405 deaths. As of 17 March, three quarters of all the coronavirus deaths in Europe were in Italy. In Lombardy alone, there were 319 deaths in a single day. The experience of these Italian hospitals has been an important factor in the UK toughening up its own measures against the virus, after a report this week from the MRC Centre for Global Infectious Disease Analysis. Inside a hospital in Italy For those working on the frontline it has become a terrible new reality. In the nine years he’s been a nurse, Paolo Miranda has seen many people die – he’s used to it. But what has struck him during this pandemic is seeing so many people die alone. “When patients die in intensive care they are normally surrounded by their family. There is dignity in their death. And we are there to support them, it’s part of what we do.” But with families and friends prohibited from coming to the hospital, to prevent the spread of the contagion, it means that these often elderly patients have no-one with them. Anna, a 24-year-old healthcare worker in another hospital in Lombardy, says the separation from loved ones at the end is the “hardest thing”, with no-one “holding their hand or whispering something to them”. Anna It’s difficult for the staff in Cremona’s hospital to keep going - and they struggle to switch off. “I’m shattered when I come back home at the end of my shift. But then I go to sleep, and I wake up several times during the night. Most of my colleagues do,” says Miranda. He decided to document the bleak situation inside the intensive care unit by taking photographs. “I never want to forget what’s happening. It will become history.” In his photos, he wants to show his colleagues’ strength – but also their fragility. “The other day, out of the blue one of my colleagues started shouting and jumping up and down in the corridor. She’d got tested for coronavirus, and had just found out she didn’t have it. She is normally very composed, but she was terrified and couldn’t contain her relief. She’s only human.” He says he is surviving on a mix of adrenaline and the support of his colleagues. “At times, some of us crumble, we feel despair, we cry because we feel helpless when our patients are not improving.” When that happens, other members of the team immediately step up to help. “Otherwise we’d lose our minds.” The situation is starting to take its toll on health workers across the country. “At some point we will have to choose who we can treat and who we cannot. This is the biggest concern,” says Martina, an intensive care nurse in a hospital in Massa Carrara in Tuscany. “The situation is disturbing, on a physical and psychological level.”  The experience of Codogno in the past month has been to try to contain the spread of the virus by containing its people. It’s been called the “Codogno method”. But in a democracy with individual freedoms, how far can you push people to comply? Even more stringent measures have been applied in China, but how would that work in a country such as the UK? “Top-down public health measures don’t work if they don’t get buy-in from communities,” says Melissa Leach, director of the Institute of Development Studies, at the University of Sussex, who worked on tackling the Ebola epidemic. You have to understand people’s “fears and anxieties”, she says, and at present the public mood is dominated by “uncertainty”. She says there needs to be a “humanised” approach which recognises there are “questions of ethics, rights and justice” rather than “riding roughshod over people’s feelings”. In Italy there have been strict instructions to limit movement, while the UK’s approach has been more about voluntary guidance. “It’s strikingly distinct from other governments,” says former home secretary Charles Clarke, who in office was involved in contingency planning for disasters such as pandemics and terror attacks. The key difference is the extent to which the UK government is steered by scientific advice, says Clarke, with the visual embodiment being that when the prime minister speaks he is flanked by his expert advisers. “Politicians’ words are never going to reassure people. They think politicians have other motives,” says Clarke. He backs the policy of sticking to the scientific evidence and says there will have been very detailed planning and rehearsal of each step taken, including the language of how it’s presented. For instance, a phrase like “self-isolating” suggests a positive choice by people and not something imposed on them by government. But for those in Lombardy whose families have already suffered, there are more immediate worries. Maria Vittoria Falchetti is getting her family’s company, MTA, back up and running again - while mourning the loss of her father. “Work is the only thing that keeps us alive at the moment, despite the fear and mourning,” she says, with production now resumed in Codogno and a factory in Shanghai. It’s another example of the connectivity that links even a small town with the global economy. She says her father would have been proud of how the workforce in Codogno has “pitched in” to help. Staff now stand apart from each other, they have their temperatures checked and are given gloves and the face masks that have become the hallmark of the pandemic. It’s been a continuous story of the grimly unexpected, including the death of her father. “He had a high fever and was having difficulty breathing. The ambulance took him to the hospital and we never saw him again. He died alone,” she says. “They didn’t allow us to visit him.” Falchetti says she feels “scared and dazed” by what’s happened. Even when “normality” comes back, she says, “nothing will be the same any more”.

"Friday has been the last school day for most children in England, Scotland and Wales until further notice, in response to the escalating coronavirus pandemic. Schools are closing to everyone except vulnerable children, and those with a parentidentified as a key worker.,external A-level and GCSE pupils will be graded via teacher assessments after exams, including Highers, were cancelled. There have been 167 deaths in England, six in Scotland, three in Wales and one in Northern Ireland. The latest 39 patients in England to die after being infected with Covid-19 were aged between 50 and 99 years old and had underlying health conditions, NHS England said on Friday. Meanwhile, more than 65,000 retired doctors and nurses in England and Wales have been askedto return to work in the NHS to help tackle the outbreak. How long could schools be closed? And the chancellor isset to announce a wage subsidy packageto try to protect millions of jobs. As of 09:00 on 19 March, 64,621 people had been tested in the UK, of which 3,269 were confirmed positive for the virus. LIVE:Global coronavirus deaths pass 10,000 A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? GETTING READY:How prepared is the UK? MAPS AND CHARTS:Visual guide to the outbreak PUBLIC TRANSPORT:What's the risk? Thegovernment has published a list of key workers,externalwhose children can still go to school if they cannot be looked after at home. These workers' jobs are considered ""critical"" for the response to the pandemic. The list has been separated into eight categories, including frontline health workers and social care staff, nursery and teaching staff and those involved in food production and delivery. It also includes the police, those in key public services, transport workers and critical staff in financial services and utilities. Anyone who thinks the emergency schools due to open on Monday will run like the regular ones is very wrong. They will instead be a patchwork of available teachers, support staff and pupils whose parents find themselves lucky enough to be on the key workers' list. They will not be following a specific curriculum, there will be no working towards exams and pupils are unlikely to be taught in their own year groups. How many pupils each school can accommodate will be a daily moving picture as staff continue to fall ill. And head teachers will have to make some tough decisions about who can come into class - and sometimes their decisions will not be popular. One spoke of arguing with a father who asked for a place because he worked in McDonald's, others in more obviously frontline jobs have also been disappointed. On the up side, the lucky ones may have a chance to learn in new and different ways, while their former classmates grapple with online learning from home. Northern Ireland Education Minister Peter Weir has said all schools should be prepared to cater for key workers' childrenwhen schools shut across the region on Monday. Nurseries, colleges and childminders will also close from Friday. Most local governments have indicated schools may not reopen properly until the end of the summer. A-level and GCSE exams are being cancelled, as well as Scottish Highers. The full list includes: Frontline health workers such asdoctorsandnurses Someteachersandsocial workers Workers in key public services including those essential to thejustice system, religious staff and public service journalists Local and national government workersdeemed crucial to delivering essential public services Workers involved infood productionprocessing, distribution, sale and delivery Public safety workers includingpolice, armed forces personnel, firefighters and prison staff Essential air, water, road and railtransport workers Utilities, communication and financial services staff, includingpostal workersandwaste disposal workers Dr Mary Bousted, joint general secretary of the National Education Union, said: ""This is a very long list and could result in some schools having the majority of pupils attending. ""Schools can only accommodate a limited number of children and the fewer children making the journey to school, and the fewer children in educational settings, the lower the risk that the virus can spread."" The government stressed that ""every child who can be safely cared for at home should be"" and asked workers to consult their employers to confirm whether ""their specific role is necessary"". Vulnerable children, who will also be exempt, include those who have a social worker and those with special educational needs. The Department for Education said it would help local authorities identify those ""who most need support at this time"". The government has encouraged local authorities to keep residential special schools and specialist colleges open wherever possible. When will the outbreak end? Pupils 'scared and anxious' School leaders said the list of key workers was ""perhaps more extensive than we might have expected"". ""We are going to have a real challenge matching resource with demand,"" said Andy Dickenson, headteacher at The Chantry School in Worcestershire. ""What we are going to be doing is providing childcare, not school,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. Meanwhile, the Department for Education aims for pupils in England to be awarded the calculated grades - which will consider their previous achievements such as mock exams and other school work- by the end of July. The new exams guidance will ask teachers to submit their views about the grades they believe their students would have earned had their exams gone ahead. But students will also have the option to sit an exam early in the next academic year - which starts in September - or they can appeal against their calculated grade if they feel it does not reflect their performance and choose to sit exams next summer. Education Secretary Gavin Williamson said on Friday these are ""extraordinary times"" and that exam boards would be working ""closely"" with teachers to implement the new system. ""We're all just wondering at the moment if it's worth revising for anything,"" Aurelia, a 17-year-old A level student told the BBC. ""Are we going to be sitting anything later in the year? Will we be given our predicted grades? Or will they be affected by our mock exams. ""I do have a lot of anxiety about it. ""I would feel a lot better about everything if we had some clarity as to how we will be graded, so I can start planning better for my future."" Meanwhile, Health Secretary Matt Hancock has said he hoped ""many, many thousands will respond"" to letters being sent to former doctors and nurses in England and Wales asking them to rejoin the NHS. In Scotland, anyone who left the medical profession during the past three years has also been asked to consider returning. Senior officials have said the ex-employees are needed to boost frontline services. This video can not be played Question Time: How can NHS, students and businesses be supported? Asked when the former medics would be able to start, Mr Hancock told BBC Breakfast those who left most recently could return ""straight away"", while others will be given refresher training ""over the next couple of weeks"".

"The Dow Jones Industrial Average of 30 major American companies fell more than 4.5% on Friday, erasing all the gains it had made since Donald Trump became president in January 2017. The drop helped to finish the worst week on Wall Street since 2008, with all three indexes down at least 12%. The falls come as authorities tighten restrictions on activity in an effort to slow the spread of the coronavirus. New York state on Friday ordered non-essential businesses to close. Illinois also made a similar move, while California earlier mandated that its residents shelter in place. The Dow lost more than 900 points to close at 19,173, while the wider S&P 500 dropped 4.3% to 2,304 and the Nasdaq lost 3.8% to 6,879.5. They have now fallen more than 30% from their recent records. Mr Trump has taken credit as the share indexes climbed during his presidency - gaining nearly 50% as of last month. He has written about them on Twitter at least 131 times, according to a tally by the New York Times. At briefings this week, Mr Trump has said he is not worried about the economy in the long-run, arguing that business will bounce back after the pandemic eases and restrictions can be relaxed. For now, however, the upheavals are severe. Unemployment claims in the US surged 30% this week, as thousands of people lost their jobs, while in the restaurant industry alone as many as 7 million jobs could be cut in the next three months, according to estimates by the National Restaurant Association. Delta Air Lines on Friday said it would lose $10bn in its second quarter, while United Airlines warned that it would cut jobs starting in April if the government does not provide relief funding. Both firms saw share prices fall about 30% this week. Coca-Cola lost more than 8%, after warning the virus had upended its growth forecast, as sales to theatres, sporting venues and restaurants evaporate. Earlier, the FTSE 100 index of top UK firms ended up 0.76%, while Germany's Dax and France's CAC 40 gained more than 3%. The market moves came as the state of New York ordered staff at all ""non-essential"" businesses to remain at home as the number of coronavirus cases continues to rise. The move expands earlier restrictions and comes as California on the west coast said its nearly 40 million residents should ""shelter in place"". The US has confirmed more than 14,000 cases of the coronavirus, including more than 7,000 in New York. The surge has started to strain its health care system. ""This is the most drastic action we can take,"" New York Governor Andrew Cuomo said, New York said pharmacies, grocery stores, banks and shipping firms were among those exempt from the order, which goes into effect on Sunday. Many places have already been forced to shut, including schools, shopping centres, and theatres. Mr Cuomo also issued additional rules for the state's 19.5 million citizens, saying healthy people who are not at risk may go outside for exercise and to go grocery shopping, but should otherwise remain at home. Dr Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease, who has been a leader of the national response, said he supported the move. ""Please co-operate with your governor,"" he said at the White House's daily coronavirus briefing. The US also said it would bar non-essential travel between the US and Canada, from midnight. However, US President Donald Trump said he did not think shelter in place orders needed to be expanded nationally, noting that many states have far lower infection rates. ""They're watching it on television but they don't have the same problems,"" he said. Restrictions aimed at reducing the spread of the coronavirus have expanded rapidly this week and are already having a devastating economic effect, with the number of Americans seeking unemployment benefits surging more than 30% this week. Economists are predicting a sharp contraction in economic growth in coming months, and have warned that millions of jobs are at risk. Congress is working on a more than $1tn relief bill, that is expected to include direct payments of more than $1,000 for each American who earns less than a certain amount. It would also include millions for businesses affected by the pandemic, such as airlines and hotels.

Acting Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf meanwhile said both sides wanted ""to make sure cargo continues, trade continues, healthcare workers continue to be able to traverse that border"". Similar restrictions have been put into place on the US's southern border with Mexico. Mexico's Foreign Secretary Marcelo Ebrard said that the measures would reduce the risk of the virus spreading further while not affecting economic activity between the two countries. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said US citizens should immediately return home unless they intend to remain abroad for some time.

On Friday, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said asylum seekers crossing into the country on foot from the US would be turned back as part of the border shutdown. Economic damage from the outbreak is also becoming clear  with more than 500,000 applications for unemployment benefits made this week compared to 27,000 in the same week last year. Air Canada has meanwhile announced plans to lay off 5,100 employees. The government has announced a C$82bn ($57bn, Â£49bn) financial package to boost the economy, more than a quarter of which will be used to directly support workers and businesses. In most provinces across the country, schools have been closed, as have public venues including bars, restaurants and cinemas. Restrictions on mass gatherings are in place. In the province of Ontario, public events of more than 50 people are banned. A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? YOUR THIRD HAND:How do you clean your smartphone?

" What happens when everyday life suddenly changes? Additional reporting: Claudia La Via in Milan, and Sofia Bettiza “I don’t think it’s really hit me yet,” says Maria Vittoria Falchetti, who works for her family’s firm in the northern Italian town of Codogno, in the epicentre of the country’s brutal coronavirus epidemic. Her father Umberto, founder of a car components business, has become one of the casualties. The 86-year-old died in hospital from the virus, with the isolation rules not allowing his family to be with him. “I’m still in quarantine and working from home. But I dread the day when I go back to the office. “My office is next to his. He kept this little purse in his drawer and I used to hear every time he took out some coins. I knew he was going to get a coffee from the machine,” she says. “I will miss that noise.” The lack of noise can be deafening. Quiet streets, empty public transport, bars and restaurants that have closed, self-isolating families and locked-down cities have become part of the strange days of this Covid-19 pandemic. Private grief such as Maria Falchetti’s comes as public life seems to be falling apart. Maria Vittoria Falchetti If the world is holding its breath to see what happens next, Codogno, a small town in Lombardy, is a microcosm of how the virus can overrun a community - and how that community can fight back. One month ago, when coronavirus was first detected in the town, even the idea of locked-down towns guarded by police checkpoints would have seemed like something from a paranoid disaster movie. Two days after the outbreak was confirmed in Codogno, everyday, modern, globalised 21st-Century life in the town had come to a halt. From being a 1,000-year-old town with cafes and old churches, it became the place where “patient one” - the person at the start of a chain of contagion - was infected. People accustomed to going wherever they wanted found themselves ordered to stay behind a new frontier. They had become mask-wearing residents of a quarantined “red zone”, a firewall to stop the disease. One of the most surprising things was how quickly people adapted, says Roberto Cighetti, a science teacher in the town. “The priorities become clear - food, health, family. That’s it. You adapt in a moment,” he says. If Italy’s journey into Covid-19 is a few weeks in front of the UK’s, there are clues about the road ahead. Cighetti says panic buying was one of the first social symptoms of the epidemic. “It’s difficult to behave well under pressure,” he says. What stopped people hoarding food was when the supermarkets demonstrated there was no shortage - by constantly and visibly re-stocking shops. Once people were confident there were no problems with the food supply, the “panicking behaviour” stopped. Codogno, 11 March 2020 Codogno, 11 March 2020 The next social challenge was an eruption of fake news. WhatsApp groups were pinging with the spread of hoaxes, false cures and conspiracy theories. “There is an instinct to spread news without verifying it, so there were rumours that were totally fake,” says the science teacher. “They created anxiety and panic and lowered the level of trust.” Cighetti was so worried that misinformation was disrupting authentic public health advice that he took to social media with other scientists to try to counter the fake facts. Local people have suffered from an “epidemic of information”, he says, both useful and fake. That might be a by-product of another unwanted piece of history about this outbreak. As epidemiologist Professor David Heymann says, this is the first time that we’re within a pandemic that “we can follow in real-time”. There was also the social distancing to get used to - and that could have its own psychological isolation, says Cighetti. “The distance translates into an emotional distance.” The coronavirus has shown how vulnerable and fragile our interconnected world can suddenly become. But the same modern communications are keeping people together. There have been remarkable online eruptions of solidarity. Italy has had its own instant festivals of singing and music from balconies, with an opera singer delivering Puccini over the rooftops of Florence like some kind of epic soundtrack. Italians sing from their windows to boost morale Italians have also taken to raising an online glass to the friends they can’t see in person. The “aperitivo” after-work drink has switched to Instagram. In Paris, people stuck inside their homes are opening their windows for synchronised night-time rounds of applause for medical workers. This clapping and cheering, echoing around the empty streets, comes from thousands of people who are separated and together at the same time. In the UK, social media is being used to prepare for the storm ahead, sharing ideas to help the elderly or isolated. A Covid-19 Mutual Aid group is supporting hundreds of local efforts and neighbours have been signing up to WhatsApp groups to offer assistance. If the Italian experience is any guide, there will be mood changes in public responses to the coronavirus, with the seriousness not necessarily evident at first. At the start of Codogno’s strange new life of the lock down, Cighetti says it felt like a “boring holiday”. The schools had closed, the bars and restaurants had shut, streets were empty, no-one was able to travel. Codogno, 23 February 2020 Codogno, 23 February 2020 There were even positive sides. In the red zone, apart from those who were ill or self-isolating, people could move within the town and the enforced break meant “families spending more time together, walking, cycling, walking the dog, baking cakes,” says Cighetti. Pupils missed being at school and the science teacher says that when they had online lessons children actually seemed more engaged than usual, appreciating the return of normality. Roberto Cighetti But Covid-19 was stalking the town - and Cighetti says the rise in deaths and illnesses meant the atmosphere changed from complaining about disruptions to work and cancelled trips to something much darker. The isolation zones made grieving even more traumatic, with families unable to reach the funerals of even their closest relatives. A son couldn’t get to the funeral of a mother. By 13 March there had been 34 deaths in a town of only 16,000 people. There have been economic shockwaves too, rippling out from fears for restaurants in Codogno through to multi-nationals and tourist industries across northern Italy and beyond. According to the International Labour Organization the virus will destroy 25 million jobs worldwide. In the globalised supply chain, the disruption to local businesses can have international implications. The firm founded by Maria Vittoria Falchetti’s father produces electronics components for the car industry - and its shutdown threatened a domino effect, until an exception was made to allow production to resume. The Lombardy lockdown, seen as a draconian measure by international standards when it was introduced, appears to have succeeded in significantly reducing the number of new cases in Codogno. There is some light in sight. Local mayor Francesco Passerini said the town had given a “virtuous” example to the rest of the country. “It’s a war. But we have every possibility of winning. Unlike with our grandfathers who went physically into battle for our freedom, we are being required to show responsibility - responsibility and calm,” said the mayor. Radio Red Zone must be Europe’s only disease-fighting radio station. It is broadcasting from behind enemy lines in the battle against the virus, serving an audience in Codogno trapped inside the quarantine zone that gave the station its name. Its 83-year-old presenter, Pino Pagani, is there to reassure his neighbours and help them not to be panicked by the virus, even though he lost three of his friends in one week to the epidemic. “The worst thing is the fear. We are afraid of one another. The other day I met a person I knew who was crossing the street. I gave him a pat on the shoulder and he shied away frightened,” he says. Pino Pagani The Lombardy town of 16,000 people has found itself as the unexpected frontline of a pandemic. When they sent home their schoolchildren it was a local problem. A month later, half the world’s entire school population - about 850 million children - are out of school, according to Unesco, including now in the UK. The radio presenter says the station’s phone-ins and information lines are there to “keep people company” while ordinary life has been suspended. There are parents having to keep children occupied, people worried about their jobs and looking after their older relatives. “They ask for advice, they want to hear our voices. They think that if we are still going, everything will be fine. So they keep on calling us,” says Pagani. He gives the example of a listener concerned about having a high temperature, but who didn’t have a thermometer to check and didn’t want to go outside. “So we passed the call to the civil protection service and they immediately delivered a thermometer to her home. She was so relieved. “It’s also a way to solve very practical problems. We tell them which bakeries are open, what time the supermarkets close. People in need can rely on us to find help.” Among the biggest worries are about the elderly, in a country with one of Europe’s oldest populations. “My sons worry about me,” says Pagani, a widower. But he refuses to be anxious for himself. “My family don’t want me to leave the house. Whenever I go out, such as to present the show, my sons block the door and keep telling me, ‘Don’t do this, don’t do that’.” But he remains undeterred. “I’ve lived my life and endured a lot of hard times. I take care when I go outside, of course, but life must go on,” says the radio presenter. But these are strange times. One of those friends who died was a co-presenter on the radio show. “He was a close friend of mine, three months younger than me. We’ve known each other since kindergarten and we grew up together. The last time I spoke to him, he said he couldn’t come in because he wasn’t feeling well. “He said he had a temperature and he was worried about infecting us. I told him not to worry. He died last week and we couldn’t even go to the funeral because of the ban on public gatherings. “So we paid a tribute to him on the airwaves.”  They’re unlikely to want to put it on tourist posters, but Codogno has acquired the label the “Wuhan of Italy”, linking it to the Chinese city that saw the first cases of Covid-19 at the end of December 2019. Codogno is the first point in the detective story of how a virus from China reached Italy and began Europe’s most deadly outbreak. “You remember it clearly when you get shocking news,” says Cighetti. The science teacher was making an early morning wake-up cup of coffee when the news appeared on his mobile phone. The virus which had closed cities in China had appeared, as if from nowhere, on his doorstep. “It didn’t seem real,” he says. The attention of the world’s virus investigators swung to Codogno as a 38-year-old man had tested positive. The town was being described as the “ground zero” of the coronavirus. What made it even more alarming, says radio presenter Pagani, was that the first person to have coronavirus was “a real sporty type and healthy” and he had fallen seriously ill. The man, Mattia, is a manager for the Anglo-Dutch firm Unilever, a project leader for cleaning products. He had previously taken a course in hygiene at one of the firm’s UK bases. “Patient one”, as he became known, is a keen sportsman who belonged to a running club and socialised in the bars and restaurants. He worked for a global business with offices and production centres around the world. He is now recovering, but a chain of infections had followed him, among his family, friends, other people in the town and health workers and patients. While these circles widened, the urgent hunt was on to make a link with the outbreak in Wuhan. Italy had already stopped flights from China, but it hadn’t stopped the case in Codogno. An initial suspicion that Mattia had been infected from a friend who had been to China soon proved to be a false lead. His employers also told the BBC that he had not visited China. So how had Covid-19 reached Codogno? Professor Paul Kellam of Imperial College London is an expert on the genetics of viruses. His team delivered the genome analysis that helped to tackle a previous coronavirus outbreak, the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus, known as Mers. Each time a coronavirus moves from one person to the next, there is a slight genetic mutation, says Prof Kellam, allowing researchers to map its “family tree”. So when a version of the virus is analysed from any new location, it is possible to see how it compares with samples from the original outbreak in Wuhan, or its relationship to other offshoots of the virus in other countries. Researchers in Milan reportedthat the version of the coronavirus in Lombardy matched an outbreak in Germany, centred on a businessman from Munich who had met a woman from Shanghai carrying the virus. This would mean that while the Italian authorities were closing the air routes from China, the virus could have already arrived from Germany. There were questions about this interpretation - with the argument that even if the German and Italian versions of the virus were similar, they could both still independently have been the result of contacts with another separate source. Either way, there was another intriguing finding from the genetic analysis - that the virus had been circulating for several weeks before it was detected in Codogno. While “patient one” was being checked for any personal links to China, the coronavirus already had a head start and would have been moving quietly in the population. This is reflected in the observations of local people, including Pagani, who reported a number of unexplained and “quite weird” cases of a pneumonia-like illness before the first coronavirus was formally identified. Prof Kellam takes the origins of Covid-19 back a stage further. Such viruses originate from animals, with bats the most likely starting point. In the cases of other coronaviruses, such as Mers and Sars, the virus went from bats to other animals, before infecting humans. Even if there has been public shock at the impact of Covid-19, he says scientists have been “highly aware” of the potential for more viruses to cross over from animals. In the case of bats, it’s likely to be through droppings, saliva or urine. In March 2019, virus experts published what seemsremarkably prescient warning- that bat-borne coronaviruses “will re-emerge to cause the next disease outbreak. In this regard, China is a likely hotspot”. “The challenge is to predict when and where, so that we can try our best to prevent such outbreaks.” Perhaps more strikingly, the four scientists who wrote the paper were all based in the Institute of Virology in Wuhan. But there is another dimension to this. Coronaviruses, first identified in 1968, require the overlap of human life with animals - and this becomes ever more frequent as wildlife habitats are destroyed and wild animals are brought into closer contact with humans. This warning about the risk of infection from “human encroachment into natural spaces” isn’t a piece of environmental opportunism. It’s from the military technology agency of the US Department of Defense, which has been funding projects to tackle the threat of bat and other animal viruses. Months before the Wuhan outbreak, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) had highlighted the risk of a pandemic to the US population from infectious diseases from animals. It’s extraordinary to think that such a chain of events, with so much chaos and destruction, might have been caused by a single bat in China. While financial markets describe unpredictable disasters as “black swans”, the billions wiped off the value of shares could have started with a small bat.  “Right now, we feel like we are in the trenches - and we are all scared,” says Paolo Miranda, an intensive care nurse in the only hospital in Cremona. The hospital, about 28km (17 miles) from Codogno, is only treating patients with coronavirus and even then it can’t keep up with demand. A field hospital is being built outside, to add to the 600 patients already being looked after inside. “Everyone is calling us heroes, but I don’t feel like one,” says Miranda. Like many of his colleagues, he’s been working 12-hour shifts for the past month. “We are professionals, but we are getting exhausted.” Paolo Miranda Overwhelming demands are being placed on staff, as hospitals struggle with the scale of the pandemic. In the four weeks since the discovery of “patient one”, the number of cases in Italy has risen to over 41,000 cases and 3,405 deaths. As of 17 March, three quarters of all the coronavirus deaths in Europe were in Italy. In Lombardy alone, there were 319 deaths in a single day. The experience of these Italian hospitals has been an important factor in the UK toughening up its own measures against the virus, after a report this week from the MRC Centre for Global Infectious Disease Analysis. Inside a hospital in Italy For those working on the frontline it has become a terrible new reality. In the nine years he’s been a nurse, Paolo Miranda has seen many people die – he’s used to it. But what has struck him during this pandemic is seeing so many people die alone. “When patients die in intensive care they are normally surrounded by their family. There is dignity in their death. And we are there to support them, it’s part of what we do.” But with families and friends prohibited from coming to the hospital, to prevent the spread of the contagion, it means that these often elderly patients have no-one with them. Anna, a 24-year-old healthcare worker in another hospital in Lombardy, says the separation from loved ones at the end is the “hardest thing”, with no-one “holding their hand or whispering something to them”. Anna It’s difficult for the staff in Cremona’s hospital to keep going - and they struggle to switch off. “I’m shattered when I come back home at the end of my shift. But then I go to sleep, and I wake up several times during the night. Most of my colleagues do,” says Miranda. He decided to document the bleak situation inside the intensive care unit by taking photographs. “I never want to forget what’s happening. It will become history.” In his photos, he wants to show his colleagues’ strength – but also their fragility. “The other day, out of the blue one of my colleagues started shouting and jumping up and down in the corridor. She’d got tested for coronavirus, and had just found out she didn’t have it. She is normally very composed, but she was terrified and couldn’t contain her relief. She’s only human.” He says he is surviving on a mix of adrenaline and the support of his colleagues. “At times, some of us crumble, we feel despair, we cry because we feel helpless when our patients are not improving.” When that happens, other members of the team immediately step up to help. “Otherwise we’d lose our minds.” The situation is starting to take its toll on health workers across the country. “At some point we will have to choose who we can treat and who we cannot. This is the biggest concern,” says Martina, an intensive care nurse in a hospital in Massa Carrara in Tuscany. “The situation is disturbing, on a physical and psychological level.”  The experience of Codogno in the past month has been to try to contain the spread of the virus by containing its people. It’s been called the “Codogno method”. But in a democracy with individual freedoms, how far can you push people to comply? Even more stringent measures have been applied in China, but how would that work in a country such as the UK? “Top-down public health measures don’t work if they don’t get buy-in from communities,” says Melissa Leach, director of the Institute of Development Studies, at the University of Sussex, who worked on tackling the Ebola epidemic. You have to understand people’s “fears and anxieties”, she says, and at present the public mood is dominated by “uncertainty”. She says there needs to be a “humanised” approach which recognises there are “questions of ethics, rights and justice” rather than “riding roughshod over people’s feelings”. In Italy there have been strict instructions to limit movement, while the UK’s approach has been more about voluntary guidance. “It’s strikingly distinct from other governments,” says former home secretary Charles Clarke, who in office was involved in contingency planning for disasters such as pandemics and terror attacks. The key difference is the extent to which the UK government is steered by scientific advice, says Clarke, with the visual embodiment being that when the prime minister speaks he is flanked by his expert advisers. “Politicians’ words are never going to reassure people. They think politicians have other motives,” says Clarke. He backs the policy of sticking to the scientific evidence and says there will have been very detailed planning and rehearsal of each step taken, including the language of how it’s presented. For instance, a phrase like “self-isolating” suggests a positive choice by people and not something imposed on them by government. But for those in Lombardy whose families have already suffered, there are more immediate worries. Maria Vittoria Falchetti is getting her family’s company, MTA, back up and running again - while mourning the loss of her father. “Work is the only thing that keeps us alive at the moment, despite the fear and mourning,” she says, with production now resumed in Codogno and a factory in Shanghai. It’s another example of the connectivity that links even a small town with the global economy. She says her father would have been proud of how the workforce in Codogno has “pitched in” to help. Staff now stand apart from each other, they have their temperatures checked and are given gloves and the face masks that have become the hallmark of the pandemic. It’s been a continuous story of the grimly unexpected, including the death of her father. “He had a high fever and was having difficulty breathing. The ambulance took him to the hospital and we never saw him again. He died alone,” she says. “They didn’t allow us to visit him.” Falchetti says she feels “scared and dazed” by what’s happened. Even when “normality” comes back, she says, “nothing will be the same any more”.

"The Dow Jones Industrial Average of 30 major American companies fell more than 4.5% on Friday, erasing all the gains it had made since Donald Trump became president in January 2017. The drop helped to finish the worst week on Wall Street since 2008, with all three indexes down at least 12%. The falls come as authorities tighten restrictions on activity in an effort to slow the spread of the coronavirus. New York state on Friday ordered non-essential businesses to close. Illinois also made a similar move, while California earlier mandated that its residents shelter in place. The Dow lost more than 900 points to close at 19,173, while the wider S&P 500 dropped 4.3% to 2,304 and the Nasdaq lost 3.8% to 6,879.5. They have now fallen more than 30% from their recent records. Mr Trump has taken credit as the share indexes climbed during his presidency - gaining nearly 50% as of last month. He has written about them on Twitter at least 131 times, according to a tally by the New York Times. At briefings this week, Mr Trump has said he is not worried about the economy in the long-run, arguing that business will bounce back after the pandemic eases and restrictions can be relaxed. For now, however, the upheavals are severe. Unemployment claims in the US surged 30% this week, as thousands of people lost their jobs, while in the restaurant industry alone as many as 7 million jobs could be cut in the next three months, according to estimates by the National Restaurant Association. Delta Air Lines on Friday said it would lose $10bn in its second quarter, while United Airlines warned that it would cut jobs starting in April if the government does not provide relief funding. Both firms saw share prices fall about 30% this week. Coca-Cola lost more than 8%, after warning the virus had upended its growth forecast, as sales to theatres, sporting venues and restaurants evaporate. Earlier, the FTSE 100 index of top UK firms ended up 0.76%, while Germany's Dax and France's CAC 40 gained more than 3%. The market moves came as the state of New York ordered staff at all ""non-essential"" businesses to remain at home as the number of coronavirus cases continues to rise. The move expands earlier restrictions and comes as California on the west coast said its nearly 40 million residents should ""shelter in place"". The US has confirmed more than 14,000 cases of the coronavirus, including more than 7,000 in New York. The surge has started to strain its health care system. ""This is the most drastic action we can take,"" New York Governor Andrew Cuomo said, New York said pharmacies, grocery stores, banks and shipping firms were among those exempt from the order, which goes into effect on Sunday. Many places have already been forced to shut, including schools, shopping centres, and theatres. Mr Cuomo also issued additional rules for the state's 19.5 million citizens, saying healthy people who are not at risk may go outside for exercise and to go grocery shopping, but should otherwise remain at home. Dr Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease, who has been a leader of the national response, said he supported the move. ""Please co-operate with your governor,"" he said at the White House's daily coronavirus briefing. The US also said it would bar non-essential travel between the US and Canada, from midnight. However, US President Donald Trump said he did not think shelter in place orders needed to be expanded nationally, noting that many states have far lower infection rates. ""They're watching it on television but they don't have the same problems,"" he said. Restrictions aimed at reducing the spread of the coronavirus have expanded rapidly this week and are already having a devastating economic effect, with the number of Americans seeking unemployment benefits surging more than 30% this week. Economists are predicting a sharp contraction in economic growth in coming months, and have warned that millions of jobs are at risk. Congress is working on a more than $1tn relief bill, that is expected to include direct payments of more than $1,000 for each American who earns less than a certain amount. It would also include millions for businesses affected by the pandemic, such as airlines and hotels.

"This video can not be played Boris Johnson: ""We are telling cafes, pubs, bars and restaurants to close tonight... and not to open tomorrow"" Cafes, pubs and restaurants must close from Friday night - except for take-away food - to tackle coronavirus, Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said. All the UK's nightclubs, theatres, cinemas, gyms and leisure centres have also been told to close ""as soon as they reasonably can"". Mr Johnson said the situation would be reviewed each month. Meanwhile, thegovernment said it will pay 80% of wages for employeeswho are not able to work, up to Â£2,500 a month. The announcement about closures follows similar measures taken in other countries - including in Ireland, wherepubs and bars were asked to close from last Sunday. There have been 167 deaths in England from the coronavirus outbreak, as well as six in Scotland, three in Wales and one in Northern Ireland. The Bricklayer's Arms pub in West Putney, London is pictured with a closed sign A deserted Spanish Tapas restaurant in Camberley, in Surrey Speaking at a daily Downing Street press briefing, Mr Johnson said the measures would be enforced ""strictly"" and that licensing arrangements would make doing so ""relatively simple"". He urged people not to go out on Friday night ahead of the closures, stressing: ""For now, at least physically, we need to keep people apart.""

He appealed to employers to stand by their workers during the coronavirus crisis, in the wake of many firms warning of collapse. England's deputy chief medical officer, Dr Jenny Harries, told reporters at the briefing that the government was not advising people against going outside. ""We are saying, if you are going to go outside, go in a way that reduces your social contact,"" she said. In a separate televised address, Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon also asked all restaurants, cafes, pubs and cinemas to close. First Minister of Northern Ireland Arlene Foster said the measures are ""for the community's protection"", while Wales' First Minister Mark Drakeford said the move was ""the right thing to do"". The latest announcement came afterMr Johnson said on Thursday that the UK could ""turn the tide""on the coronavirus outbreak within 12 weeks. Most UKschools closed their doors to a majority of pupils indefinitelyon Friday, in an effort to stem the spread of the virus.

This video can not be played The government has closed all schools, but what does that mean for exams, and who can still go in? Pupils whose exams were cancelled due to the coronavirus epidemic will be given grades estimated by their teachers, the government has said. The full list includes: Frontline health workers such asdoctorsandnurses Someteachersandsocial workers Workers in key public services including those essential to thejustice system, religious staff and public service journalists Local and national government workersdeemed crucial to delivering essential public services Workers involved infood productionprocessing, distribution, sale and delivery Public safety workers includingpolice, armed forces personnel, firefighters and prison staff Essential air, water, road and railtransport workers Utilities, communication and financial services staff, includingpostal workersandwaste disposal workers Mr Johnson reiterated on Friday that the government does not want to ""immobilise the Tube or our major transport networks"", which he said were ""too important for the delivery of crucial public services"". Mayor of London Sadiq Khan asked people in the capital not to use public transport ""unless genuinely essential"". ""If you ignore this advice people will die as a result,"" he said. The deputy mayor of London for transport tweeted a video of new announcements on the tube reinforcing the message. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The Duchess of Cambridge visited the London Ambulance Service 111 control room in Croydon with her husband, the Duke of Cambridge, on Friday In other key UK developments: Speaking alongside the PM on Friday, Dr Jenny Harries insisted the UK has a ""perfectly adequate"" supply of personal protective equipment (PPE) for frontline staff. She said in the last 36 hours, a completely separate ""oversight and supply chain"" had been set up to ensure hospitals and other care providers receive the gear they need The PM said he plans to chair another meeting with representatives of supermarkets on Saturday amid continuing concern over panic buying Social distancing would be needed for ""at least half of the year""to stop intensive care units being overwhelmed, according to the government's scientific advisers. The Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) recommended alternating between more and less strict measures for most of a year MPs from all the main parties are picking up their stethoscopesand returning to old jobs in health and social care in a bid to help services tackle the coronavirus crisis. It comes after news that around65,000 retired medics will be asked to return to the NHS to help fight the pandemic. Dame Vera Lynn used her 103rd birthday tocall on the British public to find ""moments of joy"" during these ""hard times"". Christmas decorations have been appearing across the country,as people stuck at home try to bring some much-needed joy amid the coronavirus pandemic Major supermarkets have announced plans to hire extra staff to cope with increased demand. Tesco is set to employ 20,000 new workers for at least the next 12 weeks; Aldi wants to recruit 9,000 (which will include 4,000 permanent roles); and Asda plans to hire more than 5,000 temporary employees laid off due to Covid-19. Morrisons said it will create 3,500 jobs to expand its home delivery service, while Lidl hopes to recruit 2,500 staff to start work immediately In a message to the nation on Thursday,the Queen urged people to come together for the common good.

Mass gatherings had already been banned a few days beforehand. But then videos of crowded pubs full of tourists ignoring the two-metres-apart social distancing advice and literally ""touching hands"" as they sang Neil Diamond's Sweet Caroline went viral. So the Irish government swiftly announced a compulsory closure until at least 29 March. The measure was widely welcomed by a relieved public that now knew where it stood on going out for a drink. Some politicians have said they are aware that not all pubs, particularly in more rural areas, are complying - but inspections by police officers have so far found no evidence of breaches. Several restaurants in Ireland, while staying closed, are now offering takeaway food - but strictly observing the recommended social distance advice as they do so. The Irish government's core Covid-19 message that to pull together as a country people will have to spend time apart is certainly currently working.

"This video can not be played Rishi Sunak: ""The government is going to step in and help to pay people's wages"" The government will pay the wages of employees unable to work due to the coronavirus pandemic, in a radical move aimed at protecting people's jobs. It will pay 80% of salary for staff who are kept on by their employer, covering wages of up to Â£2,500 a month. The ""unprecedented"" measures will stop workers being laid off due to the crisis, chancellor Rishi Sunak said. Firms have warned the virus could see them collapse, wiping out thousands of jobs, as life in the UK is put on hold. Mr Sunak saidclosing pubs and restaurantswould have a ""significant impact"" on businesses. It is understood that the wage subsidy will apply to firms where bosses have already had to lay off workers due to the coronavirus, as long as they are brought back into the workforce and instead granted a leave of absence. Coronavirus: Wages, sick pay and time off explained Labour urges 'faster' cash for workers Coronavirus recession not yet a depression The chancellor said the move would mean workers should be able to keep their jobs, even if their employer could not afford to pay them. He said they were ""unprecedented measures for unprecedented times."" ""I know that people are worried about losing their jobs, about not being able to pay the rent or mortgage, about not having enough set by for food and bills... to all those at home right now, anxious about the days ahead, I say this: you will not face this alone,"" Mr Sunak added The wages cover, which relates to gross pay, will be backdated to the start of March and last for three months, but Mr Sunak said he would extend the scheme for longer ""if necessary"". The scheme, which will be run by HMRC, is expected to make the first grants to businesses ""within weeks"", a Treasury spokeswoman said. Employers' body the CBI said Mr Sunak's announcement was ""a landmark package"". ""It marks the start of the UK's economic fightback - an unparalleled joint effort by enterprise and government to help our country emerge from this crisis with the minimum possible damage,"" said director general Carolyn Fairbairn. The Resolution Foundation think tank also said the package was ""hugely welcome"", reaching lower-paid workers that were most at risk of job losses. But other lobby groups warned of the potential risk to firms which had to wait for the money to arrive. Kate Nicholls, the chief executive of trade body UK Hospitality, said many businesses faced rent payments before the support was due. ""Banks and landlords need to do more to help us bridge the gap towards this generous government support. Damage is being done now, so we need help now."" The Federation of Small Businesses also warned the delay in wages help - potentially until the end of April - meant many small firms would still face ""an immediate, potentially terminal cash flow crunch"". The government has faced huge pressure to intervene to support workers to prevent mass unemployment as anti-virus measures have seen many firms' revenues evaporate almost overnight. The wage package is the latest in a series of government moves aimed at easing the burden on businesses and their employees. However, there was not the same wages guarantee for the self-employed. Instead, Mr Sunak increased benefits that many will have to fall back on. Other measures to support firms and workers included: VAT payments by companies deferred until the end of June Interest free cash grants to small businesses Self-assessment income tax payments for July 2020 deferred for six months Increase in standard Universal Credit of Â£20 a week, with the same rise for those still on the working tax credit scheme Nearly Â£1bn for those struggling to pay rent, through increases in housing benefit and Universal Credit Capital Economics said that it expected the unemployment rate to rise from just under 4% to about 6% due to the crisis. However, without this latest government intervention, that rate would have risen to the financial crisis level of 8%, it said. This move is an incredible intervention for any British government, let alone a Conservative one, but proportionate to the size of the terrible, but temporary, economic impact that could follow the coronavirus shutdowns. In theory, it should save hundreds of thousands of jobs. Perhaps more. Employers have to accept that the government is doing something they would have never imagined a UK government to do. At 80% cent of wages up to Â£2,500 a month it is a scheme more generous than some of the high welfare Scandinavian countries. It instantly transforms the social safety net of this nation. It shows that the Treasury does believe that the very sharp plunge in the size of the economy can be followed by a bounceback - but not if millions of people are scarred by unemployment. Economics shows that these can have long lasting impact. The chancellor was given the room for this partly by the Bank of England's biggest ever announcement of purchasing government debt. There are risks if this pandemic lasts much longer than three months. But the risks of not acting were much greater. Now it requires employers to hold their nerve until the payments begin at the end of next month. And for the banks to help that process.

"Chancellor Rishi Sunak is set to announce a wage subsidy package Chancellor Rishi Sunak is to announce an employment and wage subsidy package to try to protect millions of jobs. Talks went on into the night with business groups and union leaders, who urged the government to help pay wages amid the coronavirus pandemic. Many firms are warning of collapse, wiping out thousands of jobs, as life in the UK is largely put on hold. News of more help for companies pushed stock markets higher, with the FTSE 100 and FTSE 250 up 5% at one point. The pound rose 3.3% from a 35-year low to $1.18. The chancellor's wage package, due to be unveiled later on Friday, is the latest in a string of big fiscal attempts to ease the burden on businesses and their employees. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has urged struggling businesses to ""stick by their employees, because we're all going to need them"". Coronavirus: A visual guide to the economic impact 'There isn't time. Firms are closing now' Government must pay for workers' wages One proposal under discussion is for the UK to follow the lead of countries such as Denmark, where the government has promised to cover 75% of salaries at private companies for three months, if they promise not to let staff go. EASY STEPS:How to keep safe A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? GETTING READY:How prepared is the UK? PUBLIC TRANSPORT:What's the risk? Businesses will be ""watching carefully to see what government support comes in"" today, says Dame Carolyn Fairbairn, director general of the Confederation of British Industry. ""Many other countries have now done this - France, Germany, Spain, Italy have put employee wage support in place and if that comes through quickly I believe there are businesses who will take a different decision because they want to keep their people and they want their businesses to be viable for when we recover,"" she told the BBC. The announcement will come just days after the government unveileda range of financial measuresincluding Â£330bn in loans, Â£20bn in other aid, a business rates holiday, and grants for retailers and pubs. The Bank of England hascut interest ratestwice in a little over a week to try to provide support to the UK economy, while lenders will offer athree-month mortgage holidayto homeowners in financial difficulty due to the virus. On Thursday, the chancellor spoke to representatives of business groups and unions including the Federation of Small Businesses and the Trades Union Congress, where it was agreed more needed to be done to protect workers' jobs. ""As well as providing emergency support to business, it is essential that money goes into workers' pockets now. We must do whatever it takes to stop businesses going to the wall and workers being plunged into poverty,"" said Frances O'Grady, general secretary of the Trades Union Congress. Negotiations went on into the night between the chancellor, business groups and unions over a package of measures to support wages and pay, as many British companies see their cashflow dwindle because of the coronavirus and measures brought in to suppress it. All sides were speaking with one voice about an unprecedented scheme to help workers get through a temporary economic stoppage, although there is acknowledgement that it will not be able to make up all the gaps that emerge. Any such scheme will cost many billions of pounds. Ideas discussed include guaranteeing some proportion - over half - of workers' wages, at least for specific sectors initially. This follows the lead of countries like Denmark, which have guaranteed to support 75% of wages if firms do not make staff redundant. The support would be temporary, and could be linked to the 12 week period within which the PM mentioned the country could ""send the virus packing"". The technical difficulty is how to operate such a scheme. It could be through the tax system, or as a series of guarantees to businesses, or informally after a significant tax holiday. Former Business Secretary Greg Clark suggested in the Commons on Thursday it could work by using refunds on the Pay As You Earn tax scheme operated by all employers. Labour is floating proposals to subsidise 80-90% of workers' wages. A formal government announcement is expected this afternoon. Other countries around the world are taking measures to try to prop up their economies. IIn the US the Federal Reserve has slashed interest rates to nearly zero, andlaunched a $700bn stimulus programmein an attempt to shore up the economy.

" What happens when everyday life suddenly changes? Additional reporting: Claudia La Via in Milan, and Sofia Bettiza “I don’t think it’s really hit me yet,” says Maria Vittoria Falchetti, who works for her family’s firm in the northern Italian town of Codogno, in the epicentre of the country’s brutal coronavirus epidemic. Her father Umberto, founder of a car components business, has become one of the casualties. The 86-year-old died in hospital from the virus, with the isolation rules not allowing his family to be with him. “I’m still in quarantine and working from home. But I dread the day when I go back to the office. “My office is next to his. He kept this little purse in his drawer and I used to hear every time he took out some coins. I knew he was going to get a coffee from the machine,” she says. “I will miss that noise.” The lack of noise can be deafening. Quiet streets, empty public transport, bars and restaurants that have closed, self-isolating families and locked-down cities have become part of the strange days of this Covid-19 pandemic. Private grief such as Maria Falchetti’s comes as public life seems to be falling apart. Maria Vittoria Falchetti If the world is holding its breath to see what happens next, Codogno, a small town in Lombardy, is a microcosm of how the virus can overrun a community - and how that community can fight back. One month ago, when coronavirus was first detected in the town, even the idea of locked-down towns guarded by police checkpoints would have seemed like something from a paranoid disaster movie. Two days after the outbreak was confirmed in Codogno, everyday, modern, globalised 21st-Century life in the town had come to a halt. From being a 1,000-year-old town with cafes and old churches, it became the place where “patient one” - the person at the start of a chain of contagion - was infected. People accustomed to going wherever they wanted found themselves ordered to stay behind a new frontier. They had become mask-wearing residents of a quarantined “red zone”, a firewall to stop the disease. One of the most surprising things was how quickly people adapted, says Roberto Cighetti, a science teacher in the town. “The priorities become clear - food, health, family. That’s it. You adapt in a moment,” he says. If Italy’s journey into Covid-19 is a few weeks in front of the UK’s, there are clues about the road ahead. Cighetti says panic buying was one of the first social symptoms of the epidemic. “It’s difficult to behave well under pressure,” he says. What stopped people hoarding food was when the supermarkets demonstrated there was no shortage - by constantly and visibly re-stocking shops. Once people were confident there were no problems with the food supply, the “panicking behaviour” stopped. Codogno, 11 March 2020 Codogno, 11 March 2020 The next social challenge was an eruption of fake news. WhatsApp groups were pinging with the spread of hoaxes, false cures and conspiracy theories. “There is an instinct to spread news without verifying it, so there were rumours that were totally fake,” says the science teacher. “They created anxiety and panic and lowered the level of trust.” Cighetti was so worried that misinformation was disrupting authentic public health advice that he took to social media with other scientists to try to counter the fake facts. Local people have suffered from an “epidemic of information”, he says, both useful and fake. That might be a by-product of another unwanted piece of history about this outbreak. As epidemiologist Professor David Heymann says, this is the first time that we’re within a pandemic that “we can follow in real-time”. There was also the social distancing to get used to - and that could have its own psychological isolation, says Cighetti. “The distance translates into an emotional distance.” The coronavirus has shown how vulnerable and fragile our interconnected world can suddenly become. But the same modern communications are keeping people together. There have been remarkable online eruptions of solidarity. Italy has had its own instant festivals of singing and music from balconies, with an opera singer delivering Puccini over the rooftops of Florence like some kind of epic soundtrack. Italians sing from their windows to boost morale Italians have also taken to raising an online glass to the friends they can’t see in person. The “aperitivo” after-work drink has switched to Instagram. In Paris, people stuck inside their homes are opening their windows for synchronised night-time rounds of applause for medical workers. This clapping and cheering, echoing around the empty streets, comes from thousands of people who are separated and together at the same time. In the UK, social media is being used to prepare for the storm ahead, sharing ideas to help the elderly or isolated. A Covid-19 Mutual Aid group is supporting hundreds of local efforts and neighbours have been signing up to WhatsApp groups to offer assistance. If the Italian experience is any guide, there will be mood changes in public responses to the coronavirus, with the seriousness not necessarily evident at first. At the start of Codogno’s strange new life of the lock down, Cighetti says it felt like a “boring holiday”. The schools had closed, the bars and restaurants had shut, streets were empty, no-one was able to travel. Codogno, 23 February 2020 Codogno, 23 February 2020 There were even positive sides. In the red zone, apart from those who were ill or self-isolating, people could move within the town and the enforced break meant “families spending more time together, walking, cycling, walking the dog, baking cakes,” says Cighetti. Pupils missed being at school and the science teacher says that when they had online lessons children actually seemed more engaged than usual, appreciating the return of normality. Roberto Cighetti But Covid-19 was stalking the town - and Cighetti says the rise in deaths and illnesses meant the atmosphere changed from complaining about disruptions to work and cancelled trips to something much darker. The isolation zones made grieving even more traumatic, with families unable to reach the funerals of even their closest relatives. A son couldn’t get to the funeral of a mother. By 13 March there had been 34 deaths in a town of only 16,000 people. There have been economic shockwaves too, rippling out from fears for restaurants in Codogno through to multi-nationals and tourist industries across northern Italy and beyond. According to the International Labour Organization the virus will destroy 25 million jobs worldwide. In the globalised supply chain, the disruption to local businesses can have international implications. The firm founded by Maria Vittoria Falchetti’s father produces electronics components for the car industry - and its shutdown threatened a domino effect, until an exception was made to allow production to resume. The Lombardy lockdown, seen as a draconian measure by international standards when it was introduced, appears to have succeeded in significantly reducing the number of new cases in Codogno. There is some light in sight. Local mayor Francesco Passerini said the town had given a “virtuous” example to the rest of the country. “It’s a war. But we have every possibility of winning. Unlike with our grandfathers who went physically into battle for our freedom, we are being required to show responsibility - responsibility and calm,” said the mayor. Radio Red Zone must be Europe’s only disease-fighting radio station. It is broadcasting from behind enemy lines in the battle against the virus, serving an audience in Codogno trapped inside the quarantine zone that gave the station its name. Its 83-year-old presenter, Pino Pagani, is there to reassure his neighbours and help them not to be panicked by the virus, even though he lost three of his friends in one week to the epidemic. “The worst thing is the fear. We are afraid of one another. The other day I met a person I knew who was crossing the street. I gave him a pat on the shoulder and he shied away frightened,” he says. Pino Pagani The Lombardy town of 16,000 people has found itself as the unexpected frontline of a pandemic. When they sent home their schoolchildren it was a local problem. A month later, half the world’s entire school population - about 850 million children - are out of school, according to Unesco, including now in the UK. The radio presenter says the station’s phone-ins and information lines are there to “keep people company” while ordinary life has been suspended. There are parents having to keep children occupied, people worried about their jobs and looking after their older relatives. “They ask for advice, they want to hear our voices. They think that if we are still going, everything will be fine. So they keep on calling us,” says Pagani. He gives the example of a listener concerned about having a high temperature, but who didn’t have a thermometer to check and didn’t want to go outside. “So we passed the call to the civil protection service and they immediately delivered a thermometer to her home. She was so relieved. “It’s also a way to solve very practical problems. We tell them which bakeries are open, what time the supermarkets close. People in need can rely on us to find help.” Among the biggest worries are about the elderly, in a country with one of Europe’s oldest populations. “My sons worry about me,” says Pagani, a widower. But he refuses to be anxious for himself. “My family don’t want me to leave the house. Whenever I go out, such as to present the show, my sons block the door and keep telling me, ‘Don’t do this, don’t do that’.” But he remains undeterred. “I’ve lived my life and endured a lot of hard times. I take care when I go outside, of course, but life must go on,” says the radio presenter. But these are strange times. One of those friends who died was a co-presenter on the radio show. “He was a close friend of mine, three months younger than me. We’ve known each other since kindergarten and we grew up together. The last time I spoke to him, he said he couldn’t come in because he wasn’t feeling well. “He said he had a temperature and he was worried about infecting us. I told him not to worry. He died last week and we couldn’t even go to the funeral because of the ban on public gatherings. “So we paid a tribute to him on the airwaves.”  They’re unlikely to want to put it on tourist posters, but Codogno has acquired the label the “Wuhan of Italy”, linking it to the Chinese city that saw the first cases of Covid-19 at the end of December 2019. Codogno is the first point in the detective story of how a virus from China reached Italy and began Europe’s most deadly outbreak. “You remember it clearly when you get shocking news,” says Cighetti. The science teacher was making an early morning wake-up cup of coffee when the news appeared on his mobile phone. The virus which had closed cities in China had appeared, as if from nowhere, on his doorstep. “It didn’t seem real,” he says. The attention of the world’s virus investigators swung to Codogno as a 38-year-old man had tested positive. The town was being described as the “ground zero” of the coronavirus. What made it even more alarming, says radio presenter Pagani, was that the first person to have coronavirus was “a real sporty type and healthy” and he had fallen seriously ill. The man, Mattia, is a manager for the Anglo-Dutch firm Unilever, a project leader for cleaning products. He had previously taken a course in hygiene at one of the firm’s UK bases. “Patient one”, as he became known, is a keen sportsman who belonged to a running club and socialised in the bars and restaurants. He worked for a global business with offices and production centres around the world. He is now recovering, but a chain of infections had followed him, among his family, friends, other people in the town and health workers and patients. While these circles widened, the urgent hunt was on to make a link with the outbreak in Wuhan. Italy had already stopped flights from China, but it hadn’t stopped the case in Codogno. An initial suspicion that Mattia had been infected from a friend who had been to China soon proved to be a false lead. His employers also told the BBC that he had not visited China. So how had Covid-19 reached Codogno? Professor Paul Kellam of Imperial College London is an expert on the genetics of viruses. His team delivered the genome analysis that helped to tackle a previous coronavirus outbreak, the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus, known as Mers. Each time a coronavirus moves from one person to the next, there is a slight genetic mutation, says Prof Kellam, allowing researchers to map its “family tree”. So when a version of the virus is analysed from any new location, it is possible to see how it compares with samples from the original outbreak in Wuhan, or its relationship to other offshoots of the virus in other countries. Researchers in Milan reportedthat the version of the coronavirus in Lombardy matched an outbreak in Germany, centred on a businessman from Munich who had met a woman from Shanghai carrying the virus. This would mean that while the Italian authorities were closing the air routes from China, the virus could have already arrived from Germany. There were questions about this interpretation - with the argument that even if the German and Italian versions of the virus were similar, they could both still independently have been the result of contacts with another separate source. Either way, there was another intriguing finding from the genetic analysis - that the virus had been circulating for several weeks before it was detected in Codogno. While “patient one” was being checked for any personal links to China, the coronavirus already had a head start and would have been moving quietly in the population. This is reflected in the observations of local people, including Pagani, who reported a number of unexplained and “quite weird” cases of a pneumonia-like illness before the first coronavirus was formally identified. Prof Kellam takes the origins of Covid-19 back a stage further. Such viruses originate from animals, with bats the most likely starting point. In the cases of other coronaviruses, such as Mers and Sars, the virus went from bats to other animals, before infecting humans. Even if there has been public shock at the impact of Covid-19, he says scientists have been “highly aware” of the potential for more viruses to cross over from animals. In the case of bats, it’s likely to be through droppings, saliva or urine. In March 2019, virus experts published what seemsremarkably prescient warning- that bat-borne coronaviruses “will re-emerge to cause the next disease outbreak. In this regard, China is a likely hotspot”. “The challenge is to predict when and where, so that we can try our best to prevent such outbreaks.” Perhaps more strikingly, the four scientists who wrote the paper were all based in the Institute of Virology in Wuhan. But there is another dimension to this. Coronaviruses, first identified in 1968, require the overlap of human life with animals - and this becomes ever more frequent as wildlife habitats are destroyed and wild animals are brought into closer contact with humans. This warning about the risk of infection from “human encroachment into natural spaces” isn’t a piece of environmental opportunism. It’s from the military technology agency of the US Department of Defense, which has been funding projects to tackle the threat of bat and other animal viruses. Months before the Wuhan outbreak, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) had highlighted the risk of a pandemic to the US population from infectious diseases from animals. It’s extraordinary to think that such a chain of events, with so much chaos and destruction, might have been caused by a single bat in China. While financial markets describe unpredictable disasters as “black swans”, the billions wiped off the value of shares could have started with a small bat.  “Right now, we feel like we are in the trenches - and we are all scared,” says Paolo Miranda, an intensive care nurse in the only hospital in Cremona. The hospital, about 28km (17 miles) from Codogno, is only treating patients with coronavirus and even then it can’t keep up with demand. A field hospital is being built outside, to add to the 600 patients already being looked after inside. “Everyone is calling us heroes, but I don’t feel like one,” says Miranda. Like many of his colleagues, he’s been working 12-hour shifts for the past month. “We are professionals, but we are getting exhausted.” Paolo Miranda Overwhelming demands are being placed on staff, as hospitals struggle with the scale of the pandemic. In the four weeks since the discovery of “patient one”, the number of cases in Italy has risen to over 41,000 cases and 3,405 deaths. As of 17 March, three quarters of all the coronavirus deaths in Europe were in Italy. In Lombardy alone, there were 319 deaths in a single day. The experience of these Italian hospitals has been an important factor in the UK toughening up its own measures against the virus, after a report this week from the MRC Centre for Global Infectious Disease Analysis. Inside a hospital in Italy For those working on the frontline it has become a terrible new reality. In the nine years he’s been a nurse, Paolo Miranda has seen many people die – he’s used to it. But what has struck him during this pandemic is seeing so many people die alone. “When patients die in intensive care they are normally surrounded by their family. There is dignity in their death. And we are there to support them, it’s part of what we do.” But with families and friends prohibited from coming to the hospital, to prevent the spread of the contagion, it means that these often elderly patients have no-one with them. Anna, a 24-year-old healthcare worker in another hospital in Lombardy, says the separation from loved ones at the end is the “hardest thing”, with no-one “holding their hand or whispering something to them”. Anna It’s difficult for the staff in Cremona’s hospital to keep going - and they struggle to switch off. “I’m shattered when I come back home at the end of my shift. But then I go to sleep, and I wake up several times during the night. Most of my colleagues do,” says Miranda. He decided to document the bleak situation inside the intensive care unit by taking photographs. “I never want to forget what’s happening. It will become history.” In his photos, he wants to show his colleagues’ strength – but also their fragility. “The other day, out of the blue one of my colleagues started shouting and jumping up and down in the corridor. She’d got tested for coronavirus, and had just found out she didn’t have it. She is normally very composed, but she was terrified and couldn’t contain her relief. She’s only human.” He says he is surviving on a mix of adrenaline and the support of his colleagues. “At times, some of us crumble, we feel despair, we cry because we feel helpless when our patients are not improving.” When that happens, other members of the team immediately step up to help. “Otherwise we’d lose our minds.” The situation is starting to take its toll on health workers across the country. “At some point we will have to choose who we can treat and who we cannot. This is the biggest concern,” says Martina, an intensive care nurse in a hospital in Massa Carrara in Tuscany. “The situation is disturbing, on a physical and psychological level.”  The experience of Codogno in the past month has been to try to contain the spread of the virus by containing its people. It’s been called the “Codogno method”. But in a democracy with individual freedoms, how far can you push people to comply? Even more stringent measures have been applied in China, but how would that work in a country such as the UK? “Top-down public health measures don’t work if they don’t get buy-in from communities,” says Melissa Leach, director of the Institute of Development Studies, at the University of Sussex, who worked on tackling the Ebola epidemic. You have to understand people’s “fears and anxieties”, she says, and at present the public mood is dominated by “uncertainty”. She says there needs to be a “humanised” approach which recognises there are “questions of ethics, rights and justice” rather than “riding roughshod over people’s feelings”. In Italy there have been strict instructions to limit movement, while the UK’s approach has been more about voluntary guidance. “It’s strikingly distinct from other governments,” says former home secretary Charles Clarke, who in office was involved in contingency planning for disasters such as pandemics and terror attacks. The key difference is the extent to which the UK government is steered by scientific advice, says Clarke, with the visual embodiment being that when the prime minister speaks he is flanked by his expert advisers. “Politicians’ words are never going to reassure people. They think politicians have other motives,” says Clarke. He backs the policy of sticking to the scientific evidence and says there will have been very detailed planning and rehearsal of each step taken, including the language of how it’s presented. For instance, a phrase like “self-isolating” suggests a positive choice by people and not something imposed on them by government. But for those in Lombardy whose families have already suffered, there are more immediate worries. Maria Vittoria Falchetti is getting her family’s company, MTA, back up and running again - while mourning the loss of her father. “Work is the only thing that keeps us alive at the moment, despite the fear and mourning,” she says, with production now resumed in Codogno and a factory in Shanghai. It’s another example of the connectivity that links even a small town with the global economy. She says her father would have been proud of how the workforce in Codogno has “pitched in” to help. Staff now stand apart from each other, they have their temperatures checked and are given gloves and the face masks that have become the hallmark of the pandemic. It’s been a continuous story of the grimly unexpected, including the death of her father. “He had a high fever and was having difficulty breathing. The ambulance took him to the hospital and we never saw him again. He died alone,” she says. “They didn’t allow us to visit him.” Falchetti says she feels “scared and dazed” by what’s happened. Even when “normality” comes back, she says, “nothing will be the same any more”.

"This video can not be played Boris Johnson: ""We are telling cafes, pubs, bars and restaurants to close tonight... and not to open tomorrow"" Cafes, pubs and restaurants must close from Friday night - except for take-away food - to tackle coronavirus, Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said. All the UK's nightclubs, theatres, cinemas, gyms and leisure centres have also been told to close ""as soon as they reasonably can"". Mr Johnson said the situation would be reviewed each month. Meanwhile, thegovernment said it will pay 80% of wages for employeeswho are not able to work, up to Â£2,500 a month. The announcement about closures follows similar measures taken in other countries - including in Ireland, wherepubs and bars were asked to close from last Sunday. There have been 167 deaths in England from the coronavirus outbreak, as well as six in Scotland, three in Wales and one in Northern Ireland. The Bricklayer's Arms pub in West Putney, London is pictured with a closed sign A deserted Spanish Tapas restaurant in Camberley, in Surrey Speaking at a daily Downing Street press briefing, Mr Johnson said the measures would be enforced ""strictly"" and that licensing arrangements would make doing so ""relatively simple"". He urged people not to go out on Friday night ahead of the closures, stressing: ""For now, at least physically, we need to keep people apart."" The prime minister added: ""The more effectively we follow the advice we are given, the faster this country will stage both a medical and an economic recovery in full.""

Speaking at the same briefing, Chancellor Rishi Sunak saidthe new measures to help out-of-work employeeswere ""unprecedented"". He appealed to employers to stand by their workers during the coronavirus crisis, in the wake of many firms warning of collapse. England's deputy chief medical officer, Dr Jenny Harries, told reporters at the briefing that the government was not advising people against going outside. ""We are saying, if you are going to go outside, go in a way that reduces your social contact,"" she said. In a separate televised address, Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon also asked all restaurants, cafes, pubs and cinemas to close. First Minister of Northern Ireland Arlene Foster said the measures are ""for the community's protection"", while Wales' First Minister Mark Drakeford said the move was ""the right thing to do"". The latest announcement came afterMr Johnson said on Thursday that the UK could ""turn the tide""on the coronavirus outbreak within 12 weeks.

She said in the last 36 hours, a completely separate ""oversight and supply chain"" had been set up to ensure hospitals and other care providers receive the gear they need The PM said he plans to chair another meeting with representatives of supermarkets on Saturday amid continuing concern over panic buying Social distancing would be needed for ""at least half of the year""to stop intensive care units being overwhelmed, according to the government's scientific advisers.

Dame Vera Lynn used her 103rd birthday tocall on the British public to find ""moments of joy"" during these ""hard times"". Christmas decorations have been appearing across the country,as people stuck at home try to bring some much-needed joy amid the coronavirus pandemic Major supermarkets have announced plans to hire extra staff to cope with increased demand.

But then videos of crowded pubs full of tourists ignoring the two-metres-apart social distancing advice and literally ""touching hands"" as they sang Neil Diamond's Sweet Caroline went viral. So the Irish government swiftly announced a compulsory closure until at least 29 March. The measure was widely welcomed by a relieved public that now knew where it stood on going out for a drink. Some politicians have said they are aware that not all pubs, particularly in more rural areas, are complying - but inspections by police officers have so far found no evidence of breaches. Several restaurants in Ireland, while staying closed, are now offering takeaway food - but strictly observing the recommended social distance advice as they do so.

"Coronavirus is spreading in the UK and the government is seeking ways to minimise its spread. Without drastic measures - which could be in place for weeks, or even months - it is feared that more than 250,000 people could die. All members of the public should reduce the time they spend with others: Everyone should stop non-essential contact with others. This is particularly important for people over 70, those with underlying health conditions and pregnant women People should work from home if they can Cafes, pubs and restaurants are being closed from Friday night - except for take-away food - to tackle coronavirus People should stop all unnecessary travel Those most at risk - about 1.5 million who've had organ transplants, have severe respiratory conditions or some cancers - should not go out for 12 weeks, and will be given essential supplies if they don't have a support system of their own Everyone should continue to regularly wash their hands and avoid contacting the NHS unless it's essential. The strongest warnings are in place for those who are ill and the people close to them: Anyone with a fever or persistent cough should stay at home for seven days Anyone who lives with someone displaying coronavirus symptoms should also stay at home for 14 days.People who have to isolate themselvesshould ask others for help The government's thinking has changed quickly. It started off trying to contain coronavirus by isolating people who tested positive and asking anyone who had close contact with them to self-isolate too. Ministers then introduced policies to delay and reduce the peak, when the most cases are expected. The idea was that by pushing it back to the summer it would allow the NHS to cope. But modelling from Imperial College London prompted a change in approach. It warned the policy of a managed spread could lead to more than 250,000 deaths, with hospital intensive care units getting overwhelmed. Ministers are now seeking to suppress the spread completely. They hope this will keep deaths below 20,000. We are in uncharted territory - so it is impossible to tell. However, Prime Minister Boris Johnson has suggested that""we can turn the tide within the next 12 weeks"". But the problem with trying to suppress the virus is that as soon as you lift those measures the fear is it could quickly return. One option from experts advising the government is to go through a cycle of lifting and reapplying restrictions, using demand on intensive care as a guide. There will be close attention paid to China, which is now looking at how it lifts restrictions. It is not realistic to think that if you temporarily break the spread of coronavirus it will go away. Then you have to consider the social and economic factors at play. Businesses are going to struggle and people are going to lose their jobs. And how long are the public going to put up with being told they cannot go out, need to work from home and can no longer watch sport or go to festivals? It leaves the government with some very difficult decisions to take. EASY STEPS:What can I do? A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? MAPS AND CHARTS:Visual guide to the outbreak VIDEO:The 20-second hand wash The whole of the NHS has been put on an emergency footing. From mid-April all routine operations, such as knee and hip replacements, are being cancelled for three months. Hospitals have plans to keep coronavirus patients separate and supply staff with protective masks and suits. All hospital patients with flu-like symptoms are being tested. Patients with mild symptoms - a high temperature or new and persistent cough - are being asked to self-isolate at home. Community teams will keep an eye on them if need be. But people are being advised not to ring NHS 111 to report their symptoms unless they are worried. Currently there is no treatment or cure, so hospitals are trying to relieve the symptoms. Specialist ECMO breathing equipment is at five units for patients whose lungs fail. There are between 4,000 and 5,000 intensive care beds. But NHS officials said they can effectively increase that to between 11,000 and 12,000 by using ventilators reserved for planned surgery and those available in the private sector, Ministry of Defence, new ones being made and old stocks that are no longer used. Ministers are also working with private companies to ramp up production. A third of patients who need hospital care require intensive care support, evidence from China and Italy suggests. Doctors warn that some difficult decisions may need to be made about which patients get treatment. What questions do you have about the UK's coronavirus plans?

"Friday has been the last school day for most children in England, Scotland and Wales until further notice, in response to the escalating coronavirus pandemic. Schools are closing to everyone except vulnerable children, and those with a parentidentified as a key worker.,external A-level and GCSE pupils will be graded via teacher assessments after exams, including Highers, were cancelled. There have been 167 deaths in England, six in Scotland, three in Wales and one in Northern Ireland. The latest 39 patients in England to die after being infected with Covid-19 were aged between 50 and 99 years old and had underlying health conditions, NHS England said on Friday. Meanwhile, more than 65,000 retired doctors and nurses in England and Wales have been askedto return to work in the NHS to help tackle the outbreak. How long could schools be closed? And the chancellor isset to announce a wage subsidy packageto try to protect millions of jobs. As of 09:00 on 19 March, 64,621 people had been tested in the UK, of which 3,269 were confirmed positive for the virus. LIVE:Global coronavirus deaths pass 10,000 A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? GETTING READY:How prepared is the UK? MAPS AND CHARTS:Visual guide to the outbreak PUBLIC TRANSPORT:What's the risk? Thegovernment has published a list of key workers,externalwhose children can still go to school if they cannot be looked after at home. These workers' jobs are considered ""critical"" for the response to the pandemic. The list has been separated into eight categories, including frontline health workers and social care staff, nursery and teaching staff and those involved in food production and delivery. It also includes the police, those in key public services, transport workers and critical staff in financial services and utilities. Anyone who thinks the emergency schools due to open on Monday will run like the regular ones is very wrong. They will instead be a patchwork of available teachers, support staff and pupils whose parents find themselves lucky enough to be on the key workers' list. They will not be following a specific curriculum, there will be no working towards exams and pupils are unlikely to be taught in their own year groups. How many pupils each school can accommodate will be a daily moving picture as staff continue to fall ill. And head teachers will have to make some tough decisions about who can come into class - and sometimes their decisions will not be popular. One spoke of arguing with a father who asked for a place because he worked in McDonald's, others in more obviously frontline jobs have also been disappointed. On the up side, the lucky ones may have a chance to learn in new and different ways, while their former classmates grapple with online learning from home. Northern Ireland Education Minister Peter Weir has said all schools should be prepared to cater for key workers' childrenwhen schools shut across the region on Monday. Nurseries, colleges and childminders will also close from Friday. Most local governments have indicated schools may not reopen properly until the end of the summer. A-level and GCSE exams are being cancelled, as well as Scottish Highers. The full list includes: Frontline health workers such asdoctorsandnurses Someteachersandsocial workers Workers in key public services including those essential to thejustice system, religious staff and public service journalists Local and national government workersdeemed crucial to delivering essential public services Workers involved infood productionprocessing, distribution, sale and delivery Public safety workers includingpolice, armed forces personnel, firefighters and prison staff Essential air, water, road and railtransport workers Utilities, communication and financial services staff, includingpostal workersandwaste disposal workers Dr Mary Bousted, joint general secretary of the National Education Union, said: ""This is a very long list and could result in some schools having the majority of pupils attending. ""Schools can only accommodate a limited number of children and the fewer children making the journey to school, and the fewer children in educational settings, the lower the risk that the virus can spread."" The government stressed that ""every child who can be safely cared for at home should be"" and asked workers to consult their employers to confirm whether ""their specific role is necessary"". Vulnerable children, who will also be exempt, include those who have a social worker and those with special educational needs. The Department for Education said it would help local authorities identify those ""who most need support at this time"". The government has encouraged local authorities to keep residential special schools and specialist colleges open wherever possible. When will the outbreak end? Pupils 'scared and anxious' School leaders said the list of key workers was ""perhaps more extensive than we might have expected"". ""We are going to have a real challenge matching resource with demand,"" said Andy Dickenson, headteacher at The Chantry School in Worcestershire. ""What we are going to be doing is providing childcare, not school,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. Meanwhile, the Department for Education aims for pupils in England to be awarded the calculated grades - which will consider their previous achievements such as mock exams and other school work- by the end of July. The new exams guidance will ask teachers to submit their views about the grades they believe their students would have earned had their exams gone ahead. But students will also have the option to sit an exam early in the next academic year - which starts in September - or they can appeal against their calculated grade if they feel it does not reflect their performance and choose to sit exams next summer. Education Secretary Gavin Williamson said on Friday these are ""extraordinary times"" and that exam boards would be working ""closely"" with teachers to implement the new system. ""We're all just wondering at the moment if it's worth revising for anything,"" Aurelia, a 17-year-old A level student told the BBC. ""Are we going to be sitting anything later in the year? Will we be given our predicted grades? Or will they be affected by our mock exams. ""I do have a lot of anxiety about it. ""I would feel a lot better about everything if we had some clarity as to how we will be graded, so I can start planning better for my future."" Meanwhile, Health Secretary Matt Hancock has said he hoped ""many, many thousands will respond"" to letters being sent to former doctors and nurses in England and Wales asking them to rejoin the NHS. In Scotland, anyone who left the medical profession during the past three years has also been asked to consider returning. Senior officials have said the ex-employees are needed to boost frontline services. This video can not be played Question Time: How can NHS, students and businesses be supported? Asked when the former medics would be able to start, Mr Hancock told BBC Breakfast those who left most recently could return ""straight away"", while others will be given refresher training ""over the next couple of weeks"".

"This video can not be played California governor: ""We need to make tough decisions"" California has issued a ""stay at home"" order to residents as it tries to stem the march of the coronavirus across the most populous US state. Governor Gavin Newsom told Californians they should only leave their homes when necessary during the pandemic. He earlier estimated more than half of the 40 million people in his state would contract Covid-19 in just the next two months. The virus has claimed 205 lives in the US and infected more than 14,000. Globally nearly 250,000 patients have tested positive for the respiratory illness and more than 10,000 have died. California's mandate is the most drastic step taken by a US state to combat Covid-19. Live updates as the US warns against international travel On Friday, New York State also escalated containment efforts, ordering all non-essential employees to work from home, barring evictions and issuing social distancing rules for citizens. Mr Newsom said on Thursday evening: ""This is a moment we need to make tough decisions. We need to recognise reality."" The governor did not offer an end date to the order in his address, though he noted this is ""not a permanent state, this is a moment in time"". ""We will look back at these decisions as pivotal."" California is among the first US states to bring in blanket restrictions. Earlier this week Nevada said non-essential businesses should close for 30 days. The governor's order will allow residents to leave their homes to buy groceries or medicine, or walk a dog or take exercise, but seeks to limit public interactions. It will force businesses deemed non-essential to close, while allowing others including grocery stores, pharmacies, banks and petrol stations to stay open. About half of the state's population is already subject to similar stringent measures, including the city of San Francisco. This video can not be played Students on spring break defy Covid-19 warnings The Democratic governor said parts of the state were seeing infection rates double every four days. Speaking at a press conference in Sacramento, Mr Newsom said the virus ""will impact about 56% of us - you do the math in the state of California, that's a particularly large number"". The governor did not clarify how his officials had calculated that figure, which would amount to nearly 22.5 million infected people. But his spokesman acknowledged the estimate did not take into account the mitigation measures being implemented state-wide. Police have said they will take a soft approach to enforcing the order.A number of local departments told US media,externalthey will not arrest individuals ignoring the policy - though violating it can lead to a citation - and hope issuing warnings will keep people at home. David Willis in Los Angeles reports This is the most drastic measure that any US state governor has taken to try to tame the virus - going further even  than New York, which has more coronavirus cases than California. Speaking from the state's emergency operations centre in Sacramento - a place that is normally used to coordinate the response to wildfires or earthquakes - Mr Newsom called on people here to only leave their homes if it was absolutely necessary - to get food, collect medicines, or care for a friend or relative. He said said that based on projections nearly 20,000 more hospital beds would be needed to deal with the effects of the outbreak than the state could currently provide. He is asking Congress for a billion dollars in federal funding to support California's response to the crisis, and calling for a navy hospital ship to be deployed to the Port of Los Angeles to help deal with the anticipated surge in patients. So far, California has recorded fewer than 1,000 cases of the virus and 19 deaths, according to the Los Angeles Times. On Wednesday Mr Newsom wrote to President Donald Trump appealing for urgent federal help. On Thursday Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin said the Senate needed to pass a $1 trillion economic rescue plan by Monday. The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act would include hundreds of billions of dollars worth of loans to big corporations and small businesses, large corporate tax cuts and $1,200 (Â£1,000) cheques for taxpayers. A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? YOUR THIRD HAND:How do you clean your smartphone? BORED KIDS:Should you let your children play with others? GETTING READY:How prepared is the US? DOING GOOD:Kind Canadians start 'caremongering' trend Along with New York and Washington, California is among the US states worst hit by the coronavirus pandemic. On Thursday alone, New York City's recorded caseload of Covid-19 more than doubled to 3,954 - greater than the confirmed number of coronavirus patients in the whole of the UK. New York Governor Andrew Cuomo has escalated containment efforts by mandating all non-essential workers to stay at home as cases continue to rise in the state. He has also ordered a moratorium on all residential and commercial evictions for the next 90 days. ""Sixteen days ago, we were at zero [cases]. Today we are at 2,900. Those numbers are why we're taking these actions."" Mr Cuomo has also issued additional rules for citizens. Vulnerable individuals should only go outside for solitary exercise, avoid public transport, and wear masks. Non-vulnerable groups are barred from non-essential gatherings outside of private homes, including group exercise, and must practice social distancing of at least six feet (2m). ""This is not life as usual,"" the governor said. ""Accept it and realise it and deal with it."" He noted the new rules, which go into effect Sunday, will be enforced through a civil fine and mandatory closure for any businesses not in compliance with this guidance. But Mr Cuomo said he would not call it a shelter-in-place order. The governor is also speaking with leaders of bordering states to take regional action. The governor noted the surge in New York coronavirus cases was due to increased testing capability and that the state was testing more people per capita than China or South Korea, with 10,000 tests processed last night. New York Mayor Bill de Blasio told CNN the most populous city in the US would run out of medical supplies within three weeks if the ""explosion"" of infections continued at such a rate. He implored the federal government to help New York obtain 15,000 ventilators, three million respirator masks, 50 million surgical masks and 45 million gowns, gloves and coveralls. The mayor said the virus had so far claimed the lives of 26 people in the city. A nearly empty baggage claim area at McCarran International Airport in Las Vegas, Nevada The US Department of State, meanwhile, on Thursday urged Americans to forgo all foreign travel. In an effort to contain the global coronavirus pandemic, the nation's foreign ministry issued a Level 4 travel advisory - its top-tier warning, usually reserved for nations at war - that said ""do not travel"". Only four days ago the department sent out a Level 3 notification recommending that Americans ""reconsider travel"". The latest warning said: ""If you choose to travel internationally, your travel plans may be severely disrupted, and you may be forced to remain outside of the United States for an indefinite timeframe."" US President Donald Trump said on Thursday his administration was working with the military to bring home hundreds of Americans who have been stranded overseas amid a global shutdown on international travel. President Trump is also expected to announce plans on Friday to temporarily close the country's southern border with Mexico, according to US media. The arrangement would be similar to the closure of the Canadian border, including exemptions for essential workers and trade. The White House has also cancelled this year's meeting of G7 leaders in the US. This video can not be played Covid symptoms: What are they and how long should I self-isolate for? The annual meeting of the world's seven most powerful economic countries was due to be held in June at the Camp David presidential retreat in the US state of Maryland. But the leaders of the US, Britain, Italy, Japan, Canada, France, Germany and the EU will instead speak via video conference. White House spokesman Judd Deere said the decision was taken ""in order for each country to focus all of its resources on responding to the health and economic challenges of Covid-19"". A series of other high-profile events, from sports tournaments to music festivals, have been cancelled around the world this month because of the coronavirus pandemic.

"Supermarkets have gone on a hiring spree as demand surges as a result of the coronavirus crisis. Tesco, Asda, Aldi, and Lidl said they would hire thousands of staff after hugely increased demand saw shoppers clearing shelves. That move came before the governmentsaid it would pay the wages of workers at firms affected by the pandemic. And Sainsbury's has asked shoppers to stay 1m away from shop staff if possible, to help keep them safe. Supermarkets have been overwhelmed by a wave of panic-buying as shoppers rush to stock up amid the coronavirus pandemic. Coronavirus: What are shops doing about stockpiling? Coronavirus: Online shopping website Ocado suspends service To combat the stockpiling, in recent days the major British supermarketsimposed limits on how much of each item shoppers can buy. Along with other measures to cope with the increased demand, some of the chains have embarked on big recruitment drives for a total of more than 30,000 jobs. People have been queuing outside supermarkets before they open their doors Tesco, the UK's biggest supermarket, wants to take on 20,000 temporary workers ""to help feed the nation"", it said. ""The Covid-19 pandemic has resulted in an unprecedented increase in demand for food and household products,"" the chain said. ""At Tesco, we're working around the clock to help ensure families have access to the shopping items they need. ""We launched our recruitment drive online on Wednesday and since then we have already been overwhelmed by support from the public and thank everyone who has applied to work with us in stores."" It added that ""over the coming days thousands of new colleagues will join us"". The chain also announced on Saturday it will give all its workers across stores, distribution centres and customer engagement centres a 10% bonus on their hourly rate until 1 May - backdated to 9 March. Frontline salaried managers will receive a 10% bonus on actual hours worked, it added. Asda said it wanted to recruit more than 5,000 temporary staff from among people whose jobs have been impacted by the virus. Aldi announced it was looking to fill 5,000 new temporary posts and take on 4,000 permanent new workers for jobs in all its stores and distribution centres. And Lidl said it would create about 2,500 temporary jobs across its 800 stores in the UK. The discounter said it was hiring to ""help with an extremely busy time for stores"". Lidl GB chief executive Christian Haertnagel said staff were doing an ""incredible job at keeping our shelves stocked, and serving communities during an extremely challenging period"". ""Temporarily expanding our teams is one way we can help support our colleagues and customers, whilst providing work to those that have had their employment affected by the current situation."" Earlier this week,Morrisons announced it was creating 3,500 new jobsto expand its home delivery service, about 2,500 pickers and drivers, plus 1,000 staff in its distribution centres. It said it would make more slots available and also set up a call centre for those without access to online shopping. Morrisons said the move would help ""at a time of national need"". Shoppers outside a Tesco in West London endeavour to follow social distancing measures As well as introducing social distancing measures, Sainsbury's CEO Mike Coupe said the store would prefer customers to pay with a card rather than cash. He also said Sainsbury's would be expanding its reserved 08:00-09:00 slot for elderly, disabled and vulnerable customers to NHS and social care workers. Consultant cardiologist Dr Lisa Anderson told BBC Radio 4's Today programme this would lead to cross-infection. She said: ""It's not just about the risk to ourselves and our family; we're travelling home on the Tube and on buses, we're cross-infecting everybody at the moment."" Former health secretary Jeremy Hunt told the programme he agreed the move by supermarkets could pose a risk. He said: ""We're going to have to learn as we go along about these unintended consequences."" On Friday, at his daily Downing Street briefing, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he would be chairing a meeting with supermarket bosses on Saturday to discuss the situation. In an environment that was already tough for the High Street due to higher costs and changes in shopping habits, the coronavirus crisis has added a huge burden for retailers as many people avoid their stores. Sir Philip Green's Arcadia retail group, which includes Topshop, Topman, Dorothy Perkins, and Miss Selfridge, said on Friday it was closing all its stores. The company said it would focus on its digital and social platforms. Staff were to remain employees and receive their full pay for March, but it was not clear what would happen with staffing beyond then. However, this news came before a massive UK intervention in which Chancellor Rishi Sunak will pay the wages of employees unable to work due to the coronavirus pandemic. The radical move is aimed at protecting people's jobs. A number of travel operators have outlined measures they have been forced to bring in, due to the outbreak: Holiday park operator Butlin's said it would have to lay off 10,000 seasonal workers if it did not get enough state aid to pay their wages. Owner Bourne Leisure, which owns 50 Butlin's, Haven and Warner parks has approached the government for help Hay's Travel, which took over Thomas Cook's shops, has cut 880 jobs out of a workforce of about 5,000 to reduce costs The Confederation of Passenger Transport, which represents bus companies including Arriva, FirstGroup, Go-Ahead, National Express, and Stagecoach, says ""tens of thousands"" of jobs could go within weeks However, all these warnings and job cuts were made before the latest government announcement - and it is now unclear whether those moves will still hold. As well as the wage payments, it is understood the government wage subsidy will apply to firms where bosses have already had to lay off workers due to the coronavirus, as long as they are brought back into the workforce and instead granted a leave of absence.

"Marks & Spencer said it was preparing for the contingency that some of its stores may have to close temporarily. In a gloomy update on the coronavirus impact, the 136-year-old firm said clothes sales have suffered. But it added: ""M&S has served customers without cease through two world wars [and] terrorist bombings and we are determined to support customers now."" Also on Friday the Wetherspoon's boss said his pubs would stay open, despite government advice to avoid pubs. Tim Martin told the BBC there would be no pub closures despite the government's advice for people to avoid pubs. ""In the early part of the current week, following the Prime Minister's advice to avoid pubs, sales have declined at a significantly higher rate,"" he said. But a shutdown in the face of coronavirus would be ""over the top"", he said. He said a sensible balance was for pubs to open but to implement ""social distancing"" measures, like no drinking at the bar. His stance is contrary to many other retail chains which have started to reduce hours or shut shops. Marks & Spencer said it was planning for a ""prolonged downturn"" in demand for clothing and home goods, although it expected its food business to trade profitably throughout. It said it had benefited on a ""small scale"" as customers stocked up on food, but its ""heavy bias to chilled and fresh means we are not seeing the forward buying uplift experienced by the major grocers"". Nevertheless, it said it expects to benefit from the ""significant shift"" to eating at home.

"Supermarkets have gone on a hiring spree as demand surges as a result of the coronavirus crisis. Tesco, Asda, Aldi, and Lidl said they would hire thousands of staff after hugely increased demand saw shoppers clearing shelves. That move came before the governmentsaid it would pay the wages of workers at firms affected by the pandemic. And Sainsbury's has asked shoppers to stay 1m away from shop staff if possible, to help keep them safe. Supermarkets have been overwhelmed by a wave of panic-buying as shoppers rush to stock up amid the coronavirus pandemic. Coronavirus: What are shops doing about stockpiling? Coronavirus: Online shopping website Ocado suspends service To combat the stockpiling, in recent days the major British supermarketsimposed limits on how much of each item shoppers can buy. Along with other measures to cope with the increased demand, some of the chains have embarked on big recruitment drives for a total of more than 30,000 jobs. People have been queuing outside supermarkets before they open their doors Tesco, the UK's biggest supermarket, wants to take on 20,000 temporary workers ""to help feed the nation"", it said. ""The Covid-19 pandemic has resulted in an unprecedented increase in demand for food and household products,"" the chain said. ""At Tesco, we're working around the clock to help ensure families have access to the shopping items they need. ""We launched our recruitment drive online on Wednesday and since then we have already been overwhelmed by support from the public and thank everyone who has applied to work with us in stores."" It added that ""over the coming days thousands of new colleagues will join us"". The chain also announced on Saturday it will give all its workers across stores, distribution centres and customer engagement centres a 10% bonus on their hourly rate until 1 May - backdated to 9 March. Frontline salaried managers will receive a 10% bonus on actual hours worked, it added. Asda said it wanted to recruit more than 5,000 temporary staff from among people whose jobs have been impacted by the virus. Aldi announced it was looking to fill 5,000 new temporary posts and take on 4,000 permanent new workers for jobs in all its stores and distribution centres. And Lidl said it would create about 2,500 temporary jobs across its 800 stores in the UK. The discounter said it was hiring to ""help with an extremely busy time for stores"". Lidl GB chief executive Christian Haertnagel said staff were doing an ""incredible job at keeping our shelves stocked, and serving communities during an extremely challenging period"". ""Temporarily expanding our teams is one way we can help support our colleagues and customers, whilst providing work to those that have had their employment affected by the current situation."" Earlier this week,Morrisons announced it was creating 3,500 new jobsto expand its home delivery service, about 2,500 pickers and drivers, plus 1,000 staff in its distribution centres. It said it would make more slots available and also set up a call centre for those without access to online shopping. Morrisons said the move would help ""at a time of national need"". Shoppers outside a Tesco in West London endeavour to follow social distancing measures As well as introducing social distancing measures, Sainsbury's CEO Mike Coupe said the store would prefer customers to pay with a card rather than cash. He also said Sainsbury's would be expanding its reserved 08:00-09:00 slot for elderly, disabled and vulnerable customers to NHS and social care workers. Consultant cardiologist Dr Lisa Anderson told BBC Radio 4's Today programme this would lead to cross-infection. She said: ""It's not just about the risk to ourselves and our family; we're travelling home on the Tube and on buses, we're cross-infecting everybody at the moment."" Former health secretary Jeremy Hunt told the programme he agreed the move by supermarkets could pose a risk. He said: ""We're going to have to learn as we go along about these unintended consequences."" On Friday, at his daily Downing Street briefing, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he would be chairing a meeting with supermarket bosses on Saturday to discuss the situation. In an environment that was already tough for the High Street due to higher costs and changes in shopping habits, the coronavirus crisis has added a huge burden for retailers as many people avoid their stores. Sir Philip Green's Arcadia retail group, which includes Topshop, Topman, Dorothy Perkins, and Miss Selfridge, said on Friday it was closing all its stores. The company said it would focus on its digital and social platforms. Staff were to remain employees and receive their full pay for March, but it was not clear what would happen with staffing beyond then. However, this news came before a massive UK intervention in which Chancellor Rishi Sunak will pay the wages of employees unable to work due to the coronavirus pandemic. The radical move is aimed at protecting people's jobs. A number of travel operators have outlined measures they have been forced to bring in, due to the outbreak: Holiday park operator Butlin's said it would have to lay off 10,000 seasonal workers if it did not get enough state aid to pay their wages. Owner Bourne Leisure, which owns 50 Butlin's, Haven and Warner parks has approached the government for help Hay's Travel, which took over Thomas Cook's shops, has cut 880 jobs out of a workforce of about 5,000 to reduce costs The Confederation of Passenger Transport, which represents bus companies including Arriva, FirstGroup, Go-Ahead, National Express, and Stagecoach, says ""tens of thousands"" of jobs could go within weeks However, all these warnings and job cuts were made before the latest government announcement - and it is now unclear whether those moves will still hold. As well as the wage payments, it is understood the government wage subsidy will apply to firms where bosses have already had to lay off workers due to the coronavirus, as long as they are brought back into the workforce and instead granted a leave of absence.

"Marks & Spencer said it was preparing for the contingency that some of its stores may have to close temporarily.

But it added: ""M&S has served customers without cease through two world wars [and] terrorist bombings and we are determined to support customers now."" Also on Friday the Wetherspoon's boss said his pubs would stay open, despite government advice to avoid pubs.

"Chancellor Rishi Sunak is set to announce a wage subsidy package Chancellor Rishi Sunak is to announce an employment and wage subsidy package to try to protect millions of jobs. Talks went on into the night with business groups and union leaders, who urged the government to help pay wages amid the coronavirus pandemic. Many firms are warning of collapse, wiping out thousands of jobs, as life in the UK is largely put on hold. News of more help for companies pushed stock markets higher, with the FTSE 100 and FTSE 250 up 5% at one point. The pound rose 3.3% from a 35-year low to $1.18. The chancellor's wage package, due to be unveiled later on Friday, is the latest in a string of big fiscal attempts to ease the burden on businesses and their employees. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has urged struggling businesses to ""stick by their employees, because we're all going to need them"". Coronavirus: A visual guide to the economic impact 'There isn't time. Firms are closing now' Government must pay for workers' wages One proposal under discussion is for the UK to follow the lead of countries such as Denmark, where the government has promised to cover 75% of salaries at private companies for three months, if they promise not to let staff go. EASY STEPS:How to keep safe A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? GETTING READY:How prepared is the UK? PUBLIC TRANSPORT:What's the risk? Businesses will be ""watching carefully to see what government support comes in"" today, says Dame Carolyn Fairbairn, director general of the Confederation of British Industry. ""Many other countries have now done this - France, Germany, Spain, Italy have put employee wage support in place and if that comes through quickly I believe there are businesses who will take a different decision because they want to keep their people and they want their businesses to be viable for when we recover,"" she told the BBC. The announcement will come just days after the government unveileda range of financial measuresincluding Â£330bn in loans, Â£20bn in other aid, a business rates holiday, and grants for retailers and pubs. The Bank of England hascut interest ratestwice in a little over a week to try to provide support to the UK economy, while lenders will offer athree-month mortgage holidayto homeowners in financial difficulty due to the virus. On Thursday, the chancellor spoke to representatives of business groups and unions including the Federation of Small Businesses and the Trades Union Congress, where it was agreed more needed to be done to protect workers' jobs. ""As well as providing emergency support to business, it is essential that money goes into workers' pockets now. We must do whatever it takes to stop businesses going to the wall and workers being plunged into poverty,"" said Frances O'Grady, general secretary of the Trades Union Congress. Negotiations went on into the night between the chancellor, business groups and unions over a package of measures to support wages and pay, as many British companies see their cashflow dwindle because of the coronavirus and measures brought in to suppress it. All sides were speaking with one voice about an unprecedented scheme to help workers get through a temporary economic stoppage, although there is acknowledgement that it will not be able to make up all the gaps that emerge. Any such scheme will cost many billions of pounds. Ideas discussed include guaranteeing some proportion - over half - of workers' wages, at least for specific sectors initially. This follows the lead of countries like Denmark, which have guaranteed to support 75% of wages if firms do not make staff redundant. The support would be temporary, and could be linked to the 12 week period within which the PM mentioned the country could ""send the virus packing"". The technical difficulty is how to operate such a scheme. It could be through the tax system, or as a series of guarantees to businesses, or informally after a significant tax holiday. Former Business Secretary Greg Clark suggested in the Commons on Thursday it could work by using refunds on the Pay As You Earn tax scheme operated by all employers. Labour is floating proposals to subsidise 80-90% of workers' wages. A formal government announcement is expected this afternoon. Other countries around the world are taking measures to try to prop up their economies. IIn the US the Federal Reserve has slashed interest rates to nearly zero, andlaunched a $700bn stimulus programmein an attempt to shore up the economy. In a fresh set of measures announced on Friday, the Fed said it had taken stepsto support state and municipal money markets,external.

Train services to be cut due to coronavirus Updates on Friday 20 March Daniel Wainwright, Kate Darlington, Lauren Potts, David Schaffer and Tom Garry Explore the data on how the coronavirus pandemic unfolded in the UK. Covid vaccination campaigns are under way in the UK and across the world. At least 50,000 free weekly food parcels are to be sent out to clinically vulnerable people in England. The World Snooker Championship, due to start at the Crucible on 18 April, is postponed because of the coronavirus pandemic. Much like pubs, restaurants, theatres, gyms and leisure centres across the country, our live updates on this page are also coming to a close for the night. However, coverage of the coronavirus pandemic continues across the BBC and you can find all the latest information on the BBC news website and app. We'll be back at 8am on Monday - in the mean time, take care and have a safe weekend. Let's round-up some of today's top stories, in case you're just checking your phone for the first time this evening. Pubs, restaurants, cinemas and more have all been told to close tonight, by the prime minister, as the government further steps up itsmeasures to tackle the coronavirus. Schools across the nation have shut for the majority of pupils and, while it was an emotional day for many, some youngsterscelebrated with proms and discos.

Entry fees, which can cost more than Â£80, will not be ""immediately refunded"" with organisers saying they had already paid out ""unrecoverable"" costs. They have yet to confirm whether entrants will be compensated in future. As coronavirus continues to spread, the BBC has been receiving questions about how safe or unsafe certain modes of transport are. For example, it's a common belief that you are more likely to become ill on an aeroplane, because you're breathing ""stale"" air, but some scientists have actually said that the air on an aircraft may well be of better quality than on a train or a bus, because the air is being changed at a faster rate. So what are the risks?You can find more details here. And as a reminder, the government has advised against all non-essential travel. Here's some more on precisely what the chancellor said earlier today. Rishi Sunak outlined: ""We're setting up a new coronavirus job retention scheme. Every employer in the country will be eligible. ""Government grants will cover 80% of the salary of retained workers, up to a total of Â£2,500 per month, just above the median income. ""That means workers in any part of the UK can retain their job even if their employee can not afford to pay them, and be paid at least 80% of their salary. ""The scheme will cover the cost of wages backdated to 1 March and will be open initially for at least three months. I will extend the scheme for longer if necessary."" More details on the government's plans can be found here. We ""respect and agree with the government's decision"", says one pub in East London, as they close for the first time in 12 years.

Boris Johnson told all the UK's nightclubs, theatres, cinemas, gyms and leisure centres to close ""as soon as they reasonably can"". Speaking at his daily coronavirus news briefing the UK PM announced tougher measures to try to ensure social distancing. Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent Coronavirus is spreading in the UK and the government is seeking ways to minimise its spread. Without drastic measures, it is feared that more than 250,000 people could die. What steps should I take, how long might restrictions be in place for and how has the UK's strategy changed? These are all questions many of you are asking right now andwe have tried to provide some answers here. Cafes, pubs and restaurants must close from Friday night, except for take-away food, to tackle coronavirus, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said. Night clubs, theatres, cinemas, gyms and leisure centres have also been asked to close ""as soon as they reasonably can"". Mr Johnson said that, at present, ""we need to keep people apart"" - but that the situation will be reviewed each month. The firm says it lost Â£400,000 in a day as people cancelled holidays amid fears over coronavirus. Amy WoodfieldBBC News The UK National Space Centre has decided to donate food from its cafe to a local homeless charity, after closing on Wednesday to protect the public and staff. It's just another example of companies doing what they can to help people during the crisis, includingindie supermarkets doing what they canfor their communities andpubs handing out loo rolls. A brewery in Reading that has been financially hit by advice to avoid pubs has switched to home deliveries instead and has had its ""busiest ever day"". The independently-owned Loddon Brewery said it had not received a trade order since Tuesday, but after deciding to focus solely on home deliveries, the firm said work soared. ""We normally do takeaway beer, but that was only about 20% of our business. But we had to change that overnight,"" marketing manager Dan Hearn said. ""We pulled in everyone - our head brewer is answering the phones, our assistant brewer is out driving the van. It's an all-hands-on-pump situation, our sales manager is out delivering direct to the customer.""

"This video can not be played Question Time: How can NHS, students and businesses be supported? Letters are being sent to more than 65,000 retired doctors and nurses in England and Wales asking them to return to the NHS to help tackle the coronavirus outbreak. Senior officials say the ex-employees are needed to boost frontline services. It comes after the government pledged to ensure that all hospitals have enough protective gear and ventilators. It also publisheda list of key workers,externalwhose children will still be able to go to schoolafter they shut later. In Scotland, anyone who left the medical profession during the past three years has also been asked to consider returning to the NHS. Meanwhile, the chancelloris set to announce a wage subsidy package to protect jobs. Many firms are warning of collapse, wiping out thousands of jobs, as life in the UK is largely put on hold. One proposal under discussion is for the UK to follow the lead of countries such as Denmark, where the government has promised to cover 75% of salaries at private companies for three months, if they promise not to let staff go. In the UK, 144 people with the virus have died, and 3,269 people have tested positive for Covid-19. EASY STEPS:How to keep safe A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? GETTING READY:How prepared is the UK? PUBLIC TRANSPORT:What's the risk? Schools in the UK will close from Friday except for those looking after the children of key workers and vulnerable children. Among those workers listed in government guidance as critical to the virus response are health workers, teaching staff, police and people working in the production and delivery of vital goods such as food and medical equipment. Children with at least one parent working in the listed sectors can continue to attend school but the governmentis asking parents to keep their children at home wherever possible,external. The full list,externalincludes: Frontline health workers such asdoctorsandnurses Someteachersandsocial workers Workers in key public services including those essential to thejustice system, religious staff, and public service journalists Local and national government workersdeemed crucial to delivering essential public services Workers involved infood productionprocessing, distribution, sale and delivery Public safety workers includingpolice, armed forces personnel, firefighters, and prison staff Essential air, water, road and railtransport workers Utilities, communication and financial services staff, includingpostal workers, andwaste disposal workers It comes as England's top nurse and top doctor urged medics who have left the NHS in the last three years to re-register with the regulatory bodies to help in the battle against the ""greatest global health threat in history"". Final-year medical students and student nurses could also be given temporary work to boost the ranks. Those who return will be assessed to see how they can best help the NHS fight the pandemic. Ruth May, chief nursing officer for England, said: ""I am urging all recent former nurses to lend us your expertise and experience during this pandemic, because I have no doubt that you can help to save lives."" Professor Stephen Powis, national medical director for the NHS, said returners ""will make more of a difference than ever before - not just to patients, but to colleagues and the wider community"". The Nursing and Midwifery Council will write to 50,000 nurses whose registration has lapsed in the last three years; and the General Medical Council will contact another 15,500 doctors who have left since 2017. Earlier, Health Secretary Matt Hancock said he hoped ""many, many thousands will respond"" to the letters. Conservative MP Maria Caulfield, a former nurse, hassaid she will swap Westminster for the hospital ward,external- tweeting that it is ""important we all help where we can"". Others, such as retired NHS nurse Carolyn Shepherd from Bristol, have expressed concern. She said she had seen ""excellent staff on their knees due to the unrelenting excessive workload"" during her career. She told BBC News she would answer calls on the 111 helpline but added: ""I don't think they'll persuade me back to the front line"". ""I've got family commitments and grandchildren. My GP colleagues are incandescent at their lack of equipment. That doesn't inspire me either."" ""For 40 years I sacrificed a lot for the NHS but I am not prepared to go one step further and possibly sacrifice myself,"" she added. Carolyn Shepherd told BBC News she felt ""very out of date"" after leaving nursing in late 2017 and would feel ""unsafe"" treating patients now Asked when the those who would return could start, Mr Hancock told BBC Breakfast those who left most recently could return ""straight away"", while others will be given refresher training ""over the next couple of weeks"". He also pledged to get protective personal equipment (PPE) to frontline NHS staff and social care providers ""at pace"",following concern workers were being put at risk by shortages. Mr Hancock said 150 lorries had been dispatched overnight to get the equipment to about half the UK's hospitals, and pledged a lorry load would be sent to each before next week. He said more equipment had been sent to GPs and to pharmacists, and a roll out to care homes had also begun. This video can not be played What is social distancing? Speaking directly to NHS staff, he said: ""I totally understand that you need protective equipment... because you're literally on the frontline in what we've rightly called a war"". It comes after the government pledged to reach 25,000 tests a day in hospitals within four weeks, and said it had shipped 2.6 million masks and 10,000 bottles of hand sanitiser since Wednesday. When will the coronavirus outbreak end? How long could schools be closed? California issues 'stay at home' order amid virus Isle of Man confirms first coronavirus case Meanwhile, Mr Hancock said the government appeal for manufacturers to make ventilators had received ""thousands"" of responses,including from Formula One. Asked how many were needed, he said ""no number is too big"". He added that thespecifications for making them had now been published online,externaland urged firms to ""get on and start making them"". The government has bought a test that can detect whether someone has had coronavirus - and their immunity to it, he confirmed. He also repeated appeals for people to stop panic-buying after many supermarkets began limiting the number of items that can be bought and reserved certain opening hours for the elderly and vulnerable. This video can not be played Critical care nurse Dawn was driven to despair by the actions of panic-buyers It comes as an exhausted critical care nurse made an emotional appeal for people to leave some goods for others who need to stay healthy to carry to support the country. Responding to Dawn Bilbrough's video, Mr Hancock suggested supermarkets could consider dedicating a specific hour to key workers. Elsewhere, in a message to the nation on Thursdaythe Queen urged people to come together for the common good. The 93-year-old praised the work of scientists, medics and emergency staff, but added that everyone has a ""vitally important part to play"". The monarch's comments came shortly before the PM led the government's daily press conference, sayingthe UK can ""turn the tide"" on the coronavirus crisis within 12 weeks. But pressed on what he meant by the three-month timescale, he said he did not know how long it would go on for. Mr Johnson went on to rule out closing down public transport in London but pointed out people in some parts of the capital were not following government guidance on social distancing and would be ""enforced"" to do so if necessary.

"Friday has been the last school day for most children in England, Scotland and Wales until further notice, in response to the escalating coronavirus pandemic. Schools are closing to everyone except vulnerable children, and those with a parentidentified as a key worker.,external A-level and GCSE pupils will be graded via teacher assessments after exams, including Highers, were cancelled. There have been 167 deaths in England, six in Scotland, three in Wales and one in Northern Ireland. The latest 39 patients in England to die after being infected with Covid-19 were aged between 50 and 99 years old and had underlying health conditions, NHS England said on Friday. Meanwhile, more than 65,000 retired doctors and nurses in England and Wales have been askedto return to work in the NHS to help tackle the outbreak. How long could schools be closed? And the chancellor isset to announce a wage subsidy packageto try to protect millions of jobs. As of 09:00 on 19 March, 64,621 people had been tested in the UK, of which 3,269 were confirmed positive for the virus. LIVE:Global coronavirus deaths pass 10,000 A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? GETTING READY:How prepared is the UK? MAPS AND CHARTS:Visual guide to the outbreak PUBLIC TRANSPORT:What's the risk? Thegovernment has published a list of key workers,externalwhose children can still go to school if they cannot be looked after at home. These workers' jobs are considered ""critical"" for the response to the pandemic. The list has been separated into eight categories, including frontline health workers and social care staff, nursery and teaching staff and those involved in food production and delivery. It also includes the police, those in key public services, transport workers and critical staff in financial services and utilities. Anyone who thinks the emergency schools due to open on Monday will run like the regular ones is very wrong. They will instead be a patchwork of available teachers, support staff and pupils whose parents find themselves lucky enough to be on the key workers' list. They will not be following a specific curriculum, there will be no working towards exams and pupils are unlikely to be taught in their own year groups. How many pupils each school can accommodate will be a daily moving picture as staff continue to fall ill. And head teachers will have to make some tough decisions about who can come into class - and sometimes their decisions will not be popular. One spoke of arguing with a father who asked for a place because he worked in McDonald's, others in more obviously frontline jobs have also been disappointed. On the up side, the lucky ones may have a chance to learn in new and different ways, while their former classmates grapple with online learning from home. Northern Ireland Education Minister Peter Weir has said all schools should be prepared to cater for key workers' childrenwhen schools shut across the region on Monday. Nurseries, colleges and childminders will also close from Friday. Most local governments have indicated schools may not reopen properly until the end of the summer. A-level and GCSE exams are being cancelled, as well as Scottish Highers. The full list includes: Frontline health workers such asdoctorsandnurses Someteachersandsocial workers Workers in key public services including those essential to thejustice system, religious staff and public service journalists Local and national government workersdeemed crucial to delivering essential public services Workers involved infood productionprocessing, distribution, sale and delivery Public safety workers includingpolice, armed forces personnel, firefighters and prison staff Essential air, water, road and railtransport workers Utilities, communication and financial services staff, includingpostal workersandwaste disposal workers Dr Mary Bousted, joint general secretary of the National Education Union, said: ""This is a very long list and could result in some schools having the majority of pupils attending. ""Schools can only accommodate a limited number of children and the fewer children making the journey to school, and the fewer children in educational settings, the lower the risk that the virus can spread."" The government stressed that ""every child who can be safely cared for at home should be"" and asked workers to consult their employers to confirm whether ""their specific role is necessary"". Vulnerable children, who will also be exempt, include those who have a social worker and those with special educational needs. The Department for Education said it would help local authorities identify those ""who most need support at this time"". The government has encouraged local authorities to keep residential special schools and specialist colleges open wherever possible. When will the outbreak end? Pupils 'scared and anxious' School leaders said the list of key workers was ""perhaps more extensive than we might have expected"". ""We are going to have a real challenge matching resource with demand,"" said Andy Dickenson, headteacher at The Chantry School in Worcestershire. ""What we are going to be doing is providing childcare, not school,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. Meanwhile, the Department for Education aims for pupils in England to be awarded the calculated grades - which will consider their previous achievements such as mock exams and other school work- by the end of July. The new exams guidance will ask teachers to submit their views about the grades they believe their students would have earned had their exams gone ahead. But students will also have the option to sit an exam early in the next academic year - which starts in September - or they can appeal against their calculated grade if they feel it does not reflect their performance and choose to sit exams next summer. Education Secretary Gavin Williamson said on Friday these are ""extraordinary times"" and that exam boards would be working ""closely"" with teachers to implement the new system. ""We're all just wondering at the moment if it's worth revising for anything,"" Aurelia, a 17-year-old A level student told the BBC. ""Are we going to be sitting anything later in the year? Will we be given our predicted grades? Or will they be affected by our mock exams. ""I do have a lot of anxiety about it. ""I would feel a lot better about everything if we had some clarity as to how we will be graded, so I can start planning better for my future."" Meanwhile, Health Secretary Matt Hancock has said he hoped ""many, many thousands will respond"" to letters being sent to former doctors and nurses in England and Wales asking them to rejoin the NHS. In Scotland, anyone who left the medical profession during the past three years has also been asked to consider returning.

"Vampire bats are actually rather friendly - to each other at least Vampire bats establish friendships by sharing regurgitated blood with their neighbours in a ""kind of horrifying French kiss"", a new study says. Researchers observing the mammals said their sharing behaviours appeared to be an important aspect of their bonding. If bats go three days without eating, they can die of starvation, so sharing the blood can be a life-saving act. The study, published in the journal Current Biology, aimed to determine how the species developed relationships. It found that when the vampire bats became isolated in a roost, pairs unfamiliar with one another - but in close proximity - would begin grooming, then ""mouth-licking"" before swapping food. Secrets of how vampire bats became bloodthirsty Five things you might not know about bats ""We go from bats starting as strangers from different colonies to groupmates that act to save each other's life,"" said Prof Gerald Carter, author of the study and behavioural ecologist at Ohio State University. ""They have this 'boom and bust' foraging experience, so they either hit it big and get a large blood meal or they're starved for that night. ""Food sharing in vampire bats is like how a lot of birds regurgitate food for their offspring,external. But what's special with vampire bats is they do this for other adults,"" Prof Carter said. He added that the bats would groom even after their fur had been cleansed, suggesting that the behaviour was not just an issue of maintaining hygiene. Vampire bats are the only mammals to feed entirely on blood, which they get by biting larger animals such as cattle. The flying creatures can drink up to half their weight in blood a day, unlike their other bat relatives, which generally dine on fruit, nectar or insects. In November, a scientific study discovered that bats that form bonds while in captivity often continue their relationships when released back into the wild.

"Alice Cutter and Mark Jones were found guilty after a trial at Birmingham Crown Court A ""Miss Hitler"" contest entrant and her ex-partner have been convicted of being members of the banned far-right terrorist group National Action. Alice Cutter, 23, and Mark Jones, 25, were found guilty of being members of the neo-Nazi organisation after a retrial at Birmingham Crown Court. Garry Jack, 24, and 19-year-old Connor Scothern were also found guilty of being members of the group. All four will be sentenced at a later date. National Action, founded in 2013, was outlawed under anti-terror legislation three years later after it celebratedthe murder of Labour MP Jo Cox. Jones and Cutter were described as key members of National Action During their trial Cutter, from Sowerby Bridge, near Halifax, was described by prosecutors as a ""central spoke"" among the organisation's hardcore members, while Jones, also from Sowerby Bridge, was a ""leader and strategist"". Jurors heard how Cutter had entered the Miss Hitler beauty pageant under the name Miss Buchenwald - a reference to the Second World War death camp. They were also told how she had exchanged hundreds of messages, many racist and anti-Semitic, and was still meeting other members months after the ban. In an exchange with another National Action member a day after MP Mrs Cox was gunned down, Cutter wrote: ""Rot in hell, bitch."" She claimed not to have considered herself a member, even before the ban, despite attending meetings with group leaders and posing for a Nazi-style salute on the steps of Leeds Town Hall in 2016. Cutter also attended a demo in York in May 2016. Mr Jones had an ""original wedding edition"" of Mein Kampf Jones, a former member of the British National Party's youth wing, told jurors of his ""feelings of admiration"" for Hitler, while the court heard he had a special wedding edition of Mein Kampf. He also accepted that he posed for a photograph while holding a National Action flag and giving a Nazi-style salute in Buchenwald's execution chamber on a trip to Germany in 2016. Cutter and Jones embraced in the dock before being taken down to the cells. Garry Jack, Connor Scothern and Daniel Ward were also convicted or pleaded guilty to being National Action members Also convicted of the same offence were two other men; Garry Jack, 24, of Shard End, Birmingham, and 19-year-old Connor Scothern, from Nottingham. Self-confessed Nazi Jack was described as a foot soldier in the group, having joined six months before the ban. Scothern, who was a one-time practising Muslim, and an Antifa - anti-fascist activist - before eventually joining National Action, did not give evidence at trial. But in messages he sent following the ban in August 2017, he talked of setting up ""a clear and openly fascist youth movement"". A fifth man, Daniel Ward, 28 from Bartley Green, Birmingham, pleaded guilty to being a member of National Action last year and was jailed for three years. Det Ch Supt Kenny Bell, of the West Midlands Counter Terrorism Unit said: ""Being convicted of membership of this extreme right terrorist group is the same as belonging to other terrorist groups such as Al-Qaeda or Daesh. ""They share a real toxic extreme ideology which is a danger to the public, the same ideology that we have seen manifested in the tragic attack in New Zealand, the murder of Jo Cox MP and the attack at Finsbury Park mosque in 2017. ""This group was amassing weapons and recipes for bomb-making. They communicated through secret channels to recruit others to their cause. Left unchecked they presented a real threat to the public.""

" What happens when everyday life suddenly changes? Additional reporting: Claudia La Via in Milan, and Sofia Bettiza “I don’t think it’s really hit me yet,” says Maria Vittoria Falchetti, who works for her family’s firm in the northern Italian town of Codogno, in the epicentre of the country’s brutal coronavirus epidemic. Her father Umberto, founder of a car components business, has become one of the casualties. The 86-year-old died in hospital from the virus, with the isolation rules not allowing his family to be with him. “I’m still in quarantine and working from home. But I dread the day when I go back to the office. “My office is next to his. He kept this little purse in his drawer and I used to hear every time he took out some coins. I knew he was going to get a coffee from the machine,” she says. “I will miss that noise.” The lack of noise can be deafening. Quiet streets, empty public transport, bars and restaurants that have closed, self-isolating families and locked-down cities have become part of the strange days of this Covid-19 pandemic. Private grief such as Maria Falchetti’s comes as public life seems to be falling apart. Maria Vittoria Falchetti If the world is holding its breath to see what happens next, Codogno, a small town in Lombardy, is a microcosm of how the virus can overrun a community - and how that community can fight back. One month ago, when coronavirus was first detected in the town, even the idea of locked-down towns guarded by police checkpoints would have seemed like something from a paranoid disaster movie. Two days after the outbreak was confirmed in Codogno, everyday, modern, globalised 21st-Century life in the town had come to a halt. From being a 1,000-year-old town with cafes and old churches, it became the place where “patient one” - the person at the start of a chain of contagion - was infected. People accustomed to going wherever they wanted found themselves ordered to stay behind a new frontier. They had become mask-wearing residents of a quarantined “red zone”, a firewall to stop the disease. One of the most surprising things was how quickly people adapted, says Roberto Cighetti, a science teacher in the town. “The priorities become clear - food, health, family. That’s it. You adapt in a moment,” he says. If Italy’s journey into Covid-19 is a few weeks in front of the UK’s, there are clues about the road ahead. Cighetti says panic buying was one of the first social symptoms of the epidemic. “It’s difficult to behave well under pressure,” he says. What stopped people hoarding food was when the supermarkets demonstrated there was no shortage - by constantly and visibly re-stocking shops. Once people were confident there were no problems with the food supply, the “panicking behaviour” stopped. Codogno, 11 March 2020 Codogno, 11 March 2020 The next social challenge was an eruption of fake news. WhatsApp groups were pinging with the spread of hoaxes, false cures and conspiracy theories. “There is an instinct to spread news without verifying it, so there were rumours that were totally fake,” says the science teacher. “They created anxiety and panic and lowered the level of trust.” Cighetti was so worried that misinformation was disrupting authentic public health advice that he took to social media with other scientists to try to counter the fake facts. Local people have suffered from an “epidemic of information”, he says, both useful and fake. That might be a by-product of another unwanted piece of history about this outbreak. As epidemiologist Professor David Heymann says, this is the first time that we’re within a pandemic that “we can follow in real-time”. There was also the social distancing to get used to - and that could have its own psychological isolation, says Cighetti. “The distance translates into an emotional distance.” The coronavirus has shown how vulnerable and fragile our interconnected world can suddenly become. But the same modern communications are keeping people together. There have been remarkable online eruptions of solidarity. Italy has had its own instant festivals of singing and music from balconies, with an opera singer delivering Puccini over the rooftops of Florence like some kind of epic soundtrack. Italians sing from their windows to boost morale Italians have also taken to raising an online glass to the friends they can’t see in person. The “aperitivo” after-work drink has switched to Instagram. In Paris, people stuck inside their homes are opening their windows for synchronised night-time rounds of applause for medical workers. This clapping and cheering, echoing around the empty streets, comes from thousands of people who are separated and together at the same time. In the UK, social media is being used to prepare for the storm ahead, sharing ideas to help the elderly or isolated. A Covid-19 Mutual Aid group is supporting hundreds of local efforts and neighbours have been signing up to WhatsApp groups to offer assistance. If the Italian experience is any guide, there will be mood changes in public responses to the coronavirus, with the seriousness not necessarily evident at first. At the start of Codogno’s strange new life of the lock down, Cighetti says it felt like a “boring holiday”. The schools had closed, the bars and restaurants had shut, streets were empty, no-one was able to travel. Codogno, 23 February 2020 Codogno, 23 February 2020 There were even positive sides. In the red zone, apart from those who were ill or self-isolating, people could move within the town and the enforced break meant “families spending more time together, walking, cycling, walking the dog, baking cakes,” says Cighetti. Pupils missed being at school and the science teacher says that when they had online lessons children actually seemed more engaged than usual, appreciating the return of normality. Roberto Cighetti But Covid-19 was stalking the town - and Cighetti says the rise in deaths and illnesses meant the atmosphere changed from complaining about disruptions to work and cancelled trips to something much darker. The isolation zones made grieving even more traumatic, with families unable to reach the funerals of even their closest relatives. A son couldn’t get to the funeral of a mother. By 13 March there had been 34 deaths in a town of only 16,000 people. There have been economic shockwaves too, rippling out from fears for restaurants in Codogno through to multi-nationals and tourist industries across northern Italy and beyond. According to the International Labour Organization the virus will destroy 25 million jobs worldwide. In the globalised supply chain, the disruption to local businesses can have international implications. The firm founded by Maria Vittoria Falchetti’s father produces electronics components for the car industry - and its shutdown threatened a domino effect, until an exception was made to allow production to resume. The Lombardy lockdown, seen as a draconian measure by international standards when it was introduced, appears to have succeeded in significantly reducing the number of new cases in Codogno. There is some light in sight. Local mayor Francesco Passerini said the town had given a “virtuous” example to the rest of the country. “It’s a war. But we have every possibility of winning. Unlike with our grandfathers who went physically into battle for our freedom, we are being required to show responsibility - responsibility and calm,” said the mayor. Radio Red Zone must be Europe’s only disease-fighting radio station. It is broadcasting from behind enemy lines in the battle against the virus, serving an audience in Codogno trapped inside the quarantine zone that gave the station its name. Its 83-year-old presenter, Pino Pagani, is there to reassure his neighbours and help them not to be panicked by the virus, even though he lost three of his friends in one week to the epidemic. “The worst thing is the fear. We are afraid of one another. The other day I met a person I knew who was crossing the street. I gave him a pat on the shoulder and he shied away frightened,” he says. Pino Pagani The Lombardy town of 16,000 people has found itself as the unexpected frontline of a pandemic. When they sent home their schoolchildren it was a local problem. A month later, half the world’s entire school population - about 850 million children - are out of school, according to Unesco, including now in the UK. The radio presenter says the station’s phone-ins and information lines are there to “keep people company” while ordinary life has been suspended. There are parents having to keep children occupied, people worried about their jobs and looking after their older relatives. “They ask for advice, they want to hear our voices. They think that if we are still going, everything will be fine. So they keep on calling us,” says Pagani. He gives the example of a listener concerned about having a high temperature, but who didn’t have a thermometer to check and didn’t want to go outside. “So we passed the call to the civil protection service and they immediately delivered a thermometer to her home. She was so relieved. “It’s also a way to solve very practical problems. We tell them which bakeries are open, what time the supermarkets close. People in need can rely on us to find help.” Among the biggest worries are about the elderly, in a country with one of Europe’s oldest populations. “My sons worry about me,” says Pagani, a widower. But he refuses to be anxious for himself. “My family don’t want me to leave the house. Whenever I go out, such as to present the show, my sons block the door and keep telling me, ‘Don’t do this, don’t do that’.” But he remains undeterred. “I’ve lived my life and endured a lot of hard times. I take care when I go outside, of course, but life must go on,” says the radio presenter. But these are strange times. One of those friends who died was a co-presenter on the radio show. “He was a close friend of mine, three months younger than me. We’ve known each other since kindergarten and we grew up together. The last time I spoke to him, he said he couldn’t come in because he wasn’t feeling well. “He said he had a temperature and he was worried about infecting us. I told him not to worry. He died last week and we couldn’t even go to the funeral because of the ban on public gatherings. “So we paid a tribute to him on the airwaves.”  They’re unlikely to want to put it on tourist posters, but Codogno has acquired the label the “Wuhan of Italy”, linking it to the Chinese city that saw the first cases of Covid-19 at the end of December 2019. Codogno is the first point in the detective story of how a virus from China reached Italy and began Europe’s most deadly outbreak. “You remember it clearly when you get shocking news,” says Cighetti. The science teacher was making an early morning wake-up cup of coffee when the news appeared on his mobile phone. The virus which had closed cities in China had appeared, as if from nowhere, on his doorstep. “It didn’t seem real,” he says. The attention of the world’s virus investigators swung to Codogno as a 38-year-old man had tested positive. The town was being described as the “ground zero” of the coronavirus. What made it even more alarming, says radio presenter Pagani, was that the first person to have coronavirus was “a real sporty type and healthy” and he had fallen seriously ill. The man, Mattia, is a manager for the Anglo-Dutch firm Unilever, a project leader for cleaning products. He had previously taken a course in hygiene at one of the firm’s UK bases. “Patient one”, as he became known, is a keen sportsman who belonged to a running club and socialised in the bars and restaurants. He worked for a global business with offices and production centres around the world. He is now recovering, but a chain of infections had followed him, among his family, friends, other people in the town and health workers and patients. While these circles widened, the urgent hunt was on to make a link with the outbreak in Wuhan. Italy had already stopped flights from China, but it hadn’t stopped the case in Codogno. An initial suspicion that Mattia had been infected from a friend who had been to China soon proved to be a false lead. His employers also told the BBC that he had not visited China. So how had Covid-19 reached Codogno? Professor Paul Kellam of Imperial College London is an expert on the genetics of viruses. His team delivered the genome analysis that helped to tackle a previous coronavirus outbreak, the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus, known as Mers. Each time a coronavirus moves from one person to the next, there is a slight genetic mutation, says Prof Kellam, allowing researchers to map its “family tree”. So when a version of the virus is analysed from any new location, it is possible to see how it compares with samples from the original outbreak in Wuhan, or its relationship to other offshoots of the virus in other countries. Researchers in Milan reportedthat the version of the coronavirus in Lombardy matched an outbreak in Germany, centred on a businessman from Munich who had met a woman from Shanghai carrying the virus. This would mean that while the Italian authorities were closing the air routes from China, the virus could have already arrived from Germany. There were questions about this interpretation - with the argument that even if the German and Italian versions of the virus were similar, they could both still independently have been the result of contacts with another separate source. Either way, there was another intriguing finding from the genetic analysis - that the virus had been circulating for several weeks before it was detected in Codogno. While “patient one” was being checked for any personal links to China, the coronavirus already had a head start and would have been moving quietly in the population. This is reflected in the observations of local people, including Pagani, who reported a number of unexplained and “quite weird” cases of a pneumonia-like illness before the first coronavirus was formally identified. Prof Kellam takes the origins of Covid-19 back a stage further. Such viruses originate from animals, with bats the most likely starting point. In the cases of other coronaviruses, such as Mers and Sars, the virus went from bats to other animals, before infecting humans. Even if there has been public shock at the impact of Covid-19, he says scientists have been “highly aware” of the potential for more viruses to cross over from animals. In the case of bats, it’s likely to be through droppings, saliva or urine. In March 2019, virus experts published what seemsremarkably prescient warning- that bat-borne coronaviruses “will re-emerge to cause the next disease outbreak. In this regard, China is a likely hotspot”. “The challenge is to predict when and where, so that we can try our best to prevent such outbreaks.” Perhaps more strikingly, the four scientists who wrote the paper were all based in the Institute of Virology in Wuhan. But there is another dimension to this. Coronaviruses, first identified in 1968, require the overlap of human life with animals - and this becomes ever more frequent as wildlife habitats are destroyed and wild animals are brought into closer contact with humans. This warning about the risk of infection from “human encroachment into natural spaces” isn’t a piece of environmental opportunism. It’s from the military technology agency of the US Department of Defense, which has been funding projects to tackle the threat of bat and other animal viruses. Months before the Wuhan outbreak, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) had highlighted the risk of a pandemic to the US population from infectious diseases from animals. It’s extraordinary to think that such a chain of events, with so much chaos and destruction, might have been caused by a single bat in China. While financial markets describe unpredictable disasters as “black swans”, the billions wiped off the value of shares could have started with a small bat.  “Right now, we feel like we are in the trenches - and we are all scared,” says Paolo Miranda, an intensive care nurse in the only hospital in Cremona. The hospital, about 28km (17 miles) from Codogno, is only treating patients with coronavirus and even then it can’t keep up with demand. A field hospital is being built outside, to add to the 600 patients already being looked after inside. “Everyone is calling us heroes, but I don’t feel like one,” says Miranda. Like many of his colleagues, he’s been working 12-hour shifts for the past month. “We are professionals, but we are getting exhausted.” Paolo Miranda Overwhelming demands are being placed on staff, as hospitals struggle with the scale of the pandemic. In the four weeks since the discovery of “patient one”, the number of cases in Italy has risen to over 41,000 cases and 3,405 deaths. As of 17 March, three quarters of all the coronavirus deaths in Europe were in Italy. In Lombardy alone, there were 319 deaths in a single day. The experience of these Italian hospitals has been an important factor in the UK toughening up its own measures against the virus, after a report this week from the MRC Centre for Global Infectious Disease Analysis. Inside a hospital in Italy For those working on the frontline it has become a terrible new reality. In the nine years he’s been a nurse, Paolo Miranda has seen many people die – he’s used to it. But what has struck him during this pandemic is seeing so many people die alone. “When patients die in intensive care they are normally surrounded by their family. There is dignity in their death. And we are there to support them, it’s part of what we do.” But with families and friends prohibited from coming to the hospital, to prevent the spread of the contagion, it means that these often elderly patients have no-one with them. Anna, a 24-year-old healthcare worker in another hospital in Lombardy, says the separation from loved ones at the end is the “hardest thing”, with no-one “holding their hand or whispering something to them”. Anna It’s difficult for the staff in Cremona’s hospital to keep going - and they struggle to switch off. “I’m shattered when I come back home at the end of my shift. But then I go to sleep, and I wake up several times during the night. Most of my colleagues do,” says Miranda. He decided to document the bleak situation inside the intensive care unit by taking photographs. “I never want to forget what’s happening. It will become history.” In his photos, he wants to show his colleagues’ strength – but also their fragility. “The other day, out of the blue one of my colleagues started shouting and jumping up and down in the corridor. She’d got tested for coronavirus, and had just found out she didn’t have it. She is normally very composed, but she was terrified and couldn’t contain her relief. She’s only human.” He says he is surviving on a mix of adrenaline and the support of his colleagues. “At times, some of us crumble, we feel despair, we cry because we feel helpless when our patients are not improving.” When that happens, other members of the team immediately step up to help. “Otherwise we’d lose our minds.” The situation is starting to take its toll on health workers across the country. “At some point we will have to choose who we can treat and who we cannot. This is the biggest concern,” says Martina, an intensive care nurse in a hospital in Massa Carrara in Tuscany. “The situation is disturbing, on a physical and psychological level.”  The experience of Codogno in the past month has been to try to contain the spread of the virus by containing its people. It’s been called the “Codogno method”. But in a democracy with individual freedoms, how far can you push people to comply? Even more stringent measures have been applied in China, but how would that work in a country such as the UK? “Top-down public health measures don’t work if they don’t get buy-in from communities,” says Melissa Leach, director of the Institute of Development Studies, at the University of Sussex, who worked on tackling the Ebola epidemic. You have to understand people’s “fears and anxieties”, she says, and at present the public mood is dominated by “uncertainty”. She says there needs to be a “humanised” approach which recognises there are “questions of ethics, rights and justice” rather than “riding roughshod over people’s feelings”. In Italy there have been strict instructions to limit movement, while the UK’s approach has been more about voluntary guidance. “It’s strikingly distinct from other governments,” says former home secretary Charles Clarke, who in office was involved in contingency planning for disasters such as pandemics and terror attacks. The key difference is the extent to which the UK government is steered by scientific advice, says Clarke, with the visual embodiment being that when the prime minister speaks he is flanked by his expert advisers. “Politicians’ words are never going to reassure people. They think politicians have other motives,” says Clarke. He backs the policy of sticking to the scientific evidence and says there will have been very detailed planning and rehearsal of each step taken, including the language of how it’s presented. For instance, a phrase like “self-isolating” suggests a positive choice by people and not something imposed on them by government. But for those in Lombardy whose families have already suffered, there are more immediate worries. Maria Vittoria Falchetti is getting her family’s company, MTA, back up and running again - while mourning the loss of her father. “Work is the only thing that keeps us alive at the moment, despite the fear and mourning,” she says, with production now resumed in Codogno and a factory in Shanghai. It’s another example of the connectivity that links even a small town with the global economy. She says her father would have been proud of how the workforce in Codogno has “pitched in” to help. Staff now stand apart from each other, they have their temperatures checked and are given gloves and the face masks that have become the hallmark of the pandemic. It’s been a continuous story of the grimly unexpected, including the death of her father. “He had a high fever and was having difficulty breathing. The ambulance took him to the hospital and we never saw him again. He died alone,” she says. “They didn’t allow us to visit him.” Falchetti says she feels “scared and dazed” by what’s happened. Even when “normality” comes back, she says, “nothing will be the same any more”.

"The Bank of England has cut interest rates again in an emergency move as it tries to support the UK economy in the face of the coronavirus pandemic. It is the second cut in interest rates in just over a week, bringing them down to 0.1% from 0.25%. Interest rates are now at the lowest ever in the Bank's 325-year history. The Bank said it would also increase its holdings of UK government and corporate bonds by Â£200bn with an effort to lower the cost of borrowing. It's a dramatic move by Andrew Bailey, who only took over from Mark Carney as Bank of England governor on Monday. Last week, the Bank announced a 0.5% cut in rates to 0.25% and a package of measures to help businesses and individuals cope with the economic damage caused by the virus. The move coincided with additional measures announced by Chancellor Rishi Sunak in the Budget. Coronavirus: How the Bank rate cuts affect you Bank of England boss: Don't fire people UK interest rates cut in emergency move However, the Bank said the measures it had taken so far were not going to be enough, and believed ""a further package of measures was warranted"". ""The spread of Covid-19 and the measures being taken to contain the virus will result in an economic shock that could be sharp and large, but should be temporary,"" it added. The move comes as international investors are trying to secure more cash, in particular dollars. This means they're ditching assets such as UK government gilts, which are the ""IOU"" notes the government hands over to private investors willing to lend it money. As the gilts are sold, the price drops and the yield - the effective interest rate compared to the price - rises. What that means is the cost of borrowing to private investors as well as to the government rises - just when the Bank of England wants it to fall and the government is about to borrow huge sums. The Bank of England's plan to buy Â£200bn more bonds is aimed at fighting that effect. The fresh rate cut takes interest rates to the lowest they can feasibly go, said Jeremy Thomson-Cook, chief economist at payments company Equals Group. ""Lower rates and additional quantitative easing can keep markets satisfied and borrowing costs for both businesses and the government down but unless money is forced into the hands of small businesses soon, then it will be for nothing; they are the ones laying off staff due to a liquidity shock,"" he added. Karen Ward, chief European market strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management, said: The support to the economy and health system will require vastly higher government borrowing. The central bank showing willing to buy government debt will ensure the market can absorb this additional issuance without undue stress."" The Bank of England Governor has said today's second emergency rate cut in just over a week occurred after financial markets became ""borderline disorderly"", with fears about coronavirus leading to a rush into the US dollar away from sterling and lending to the UK government. ""We've seen very sharp moves in financial markets in the last few days, which is the pace of which frankly, was increasing very rapidly. And we were moving into conditions that were if not disorderly, frankly, bordering on disorderly let me put it that way,"" Andrew Bailey told journalists. The Bank of England Monetary Policy Committee had an emergency call this morning so that rate cuts and further ""quantitative easing"" could be agreed and announced, with the Bank needing to be ""on the offensive"" because: ""We can't wait for the hard economic data it will be too late by then"", he said. He said he had seen a range of private forecasts about the economic impact of the current crisis: ""We don't have a precise forecast - every picture we look at has a very sharp V in it"". The governor also partly blamed rumours that appeared to emerge from Westminster of a shutdown to London for adding to the volatility in markets that saw sterling fall 5% against the dollar. Such a shutdown would be likely to impact on the functioning of the City. He said: ""I do have to say that, you know, there were rumours going on the market this time yesterday that there was going to be a lockdown in London. And I'd observe that did cause market prices to start moving around at that point. But I think the government has been clear, and it's clear that that is not the intention at the moment."" The governor also said that he had already intervened to try to get loans to businesses to keep people in employment, and he said the Bank had its thinking cap on as regards further monetary boosts it can make. He reiterated his lack of enthusiasm for zero or negative interest rates because of their impact on the banking system's capacity to lend, and suggested that was the reason for limiting the cut to an unusual 0.15% (rather than the usual 0.25% or 0.5%) to a record low of 0.1%.

As France spends its first Friday under a national lockdown, authorities have warned city dwellers to refrain from their traditional weekend escapes to the countryside. Such jaunts, national police head Jean-Paul Pecquet reminded citizens, were not among the exceptions to the travel restrictions. ""I urge people to be public spirited and responsible,""  he said. Police patrols are being stepped up at all Parisian railway stations from Friday to Sunday.

The province's chief medical officer has been tasked with providing daily updates to the public on the spread of coronavirus, and the measures they should take to help flatten the curve. But people aren't just tuning in for her latest medical advice, they're also looking to her for her latest style. When she wore a dress decorated with the periodic table, the small boutique that made the frock was inundated with orders. Local media has praised her calm, but clear delivery of the grim 
statistics, and Albertans have taken to social media to praise her for 
providing a soothing scientific voice in the face of such uncertainty. She says this new-found status as fashion icon was never something she intended. âWhile Iâve never been known for my fashion sense â just ask my family â
 I believe anything that draws attention to COVID-19 is a positive,â Ms

This means they should stay at home unless they have an essential reason to go out. Non-essential businesses will be shut down, but people will still be allowed to go to grocery stores, pharmacies, gas stations and to take walks outside. Roads will remain open. âWe donât know yet all the steps weâre going to have to take to get this virus under control,""Governor J.B.

Tokyo 2020 is due to run in the Japanese capital from 24 July to 9 August Nic Coward, the chairman of UK Athletics, has suggested the Tokyo 2020 Olympics Games should be postponed because of the coronavirus crisis. Key qualifying events have been cancelled, while a number of athletes have criticised the organisers' stance to press ahead with plans to stage the Games.

Tom BatemanBBC News, Helsinki The UN's World Happiness Report says Finland is the happiest country on Earth for the third time running, which it links to its strong welfare state and high levels of public trust in government. Co-author and economics Professor Jeffrey Sachs believes that happiness will benefit Finland and the other Nordic countries in reacting to the crisis in the long term. ""As this crisis continues to unfold, we're going to need a lot of solidarity, a lot of redistribution of income, a lot of society pulling together, and places that can manage that are going to do better,"" he told the BBC. But thereâs still a lot of debate in Finland over whether or not the governmentâs response has been the right one, after it ran out of capacity to test for the virus. Finlandâs head of health security, Mika Salminen, responded by criticising the official WHO advice to governments, saying: ""We donât understand the WHOâs instructions for testing.

Katty KayWorld News America presenter In one short week, the US has gone from being the world's superpower to asking nurses to sew their own protective gowns and masks. In the early phases of this war, the country has failed miserably. Miserably. Doctors are terrified.

Duncan Laurence of the Netherlands won last year's Eurovision The Eurovision Song Contest was cancelled earlier this week because of the coronavirus outbreak - but organisers say an alternative event could be held. The European Broadcasting Union (EBU) says it is âexploring alternative programmingâ to honour the songs and artists chosen to represent the 41 competing nations. While this event would not be classed as a competition, the EBU believes it would ""help unite and entertain audiences around Europe during these challenging times"". It means this year's entries will not be eligible for the 2021 competition. Cases are increasing in countries in Africa which are stepping up their restrictions to people's movements: UK councils are warning people to beware of scammers pretending to be health officials or offering to pick up food and medicines during the coronavirus pandemic. Fraudsters are also selling counterfeit face masks and hand sanitisers, says the Local Government Association, which speaks for councils in England and Wales. The LGA is advising people not to accept help from cold-callers. Councils in Rochdale and south London received reports of attempted scams. ""By tricking elderly and vulnerable people in self-isolation to part with their cash, fraudsters are playing roulette with the lives of those most at risk,"" says Simon Blackburn, chairman of the LGA's communities board.

It earlier said deaths had risen sharply over the past 24 hours, bringing the total there to 4,032. The increase of 627 in a single day is the largest since the outbreak began. The total number of confirmed cases is now 47,021. Also in Italy: Shopworkersâ trade union Usdaw says it welcomes the announcement by Chancellor Rishi Sunak to cover 80% of the wages of those unable to work because of the pandemic. But the union warns many workers, particularly in the retail sector, will be put into ""real hardship"" because they work ""many more"" hours than they are contracted. It is calling for the calculation to be based on average income, rather than contractual pay, and wants employers to make up the 20% shortfall. ""We also urge employers to stand by their staff, keep them employed and ensure that they and their families are not plunged into poverty,"" Paddy Lillis, Usdaw general secretary, said.

"Afsar surrounded by her family on a recent outing It will be a Mother's Day like no other on Sunday, as scores of people self-isolate and are forced to rethink plans with loved ones. With the usual lunches and afternoon teas cancelled, what can people do instead to celebrate? â¨â¨Affi Parvizi-Wayne lives just three doors down from her 74-year-old mother, Afsar, in north London. Like millions of others, they won't be able to have the family lunch they planned for this weekend. For them, Mother's Day is usually a triple celebration because it coincides with Afsar's birthday and Persian New Year. ""To suddenly be told the only interaction is through the window is tough for my mum,"" says Affi, a social entrepreneur with two children. Instead, she says her family plan to congregate on the pavement outside Afsar's house and sing happy birthday. ""My nieces are going to release some balloons"". Afsar has four children and six grandchildren, and is usually the person who brings everyone together. This year, she is going to cook the family a traditional Persian dish of green herby rice and fish, and leave it on her doorstep to be collected. The two households will set up screens by their dining tables and have a virtual meal together. An added bonus is it also means family members in Iran can be present too. ""This Sunday will be about keeping the spirits up,"" Affi says. Elsewhere in London, it will be chicken legs from the freezer for Ros Ball and her family, who are self-isolating after one of them showed coronavirus symptoms. Ros's mum Penny, 73, is also staying indoors in Bedfordshire. But they plan to sit down to eat together over FaceTime. Ros's children aged, 9 and 12, will then play some online games and quizzes with their granny. Others are still planning to share a meal in a more conventional way. Becky Greenwell and her sister have moved back in with their parents, in Woking, to be with them during the coronavirus outbreak. They've had to cancel plans to celebrate Mother's Day with a Sunday roast in a pub. But it means they'll be able to sit round the dinner table together. ""We are planning on cooking my mum a three-course meal based on her favourite foods and printing out a special menu, like we used to when we were kids,"" she says. Becky, together with her sister Amanda and mother, Catherine, in Sri Lanka on Mother's Day last year Meanwhile, Savannah Dawsey-Hewitt, from Harpenden, in Hertfordshire, says she has baked her mum some ginger, turmeric and banana muffins, topped with brazil nuts. All the ingredients were chosen for their immune-boosting properties. According to current guidelines there is no evidence to suggest that Covid-19 is passed through packages or food, if cooking is what you plan to do. But the World Health Organisation (WHO) recommends following good hygiene practices when handling and preparing food, such as washing hands, cooking meat thoroughly and avoiding potential cross-contamination between cooked and uncooked foods.

Rob Bacon's mum Vicky, 75, will receive a bumper pack of her favourite magazines, sweet treats and crucially wine, for Mother's Day this year, to help see her through. Members of the newly-established family Whatsapp group - called The Bacons - also plan to set-up chairs a safe distance from Vicky and her husband Roy's front door, bringing their own food and drink. ""We will all wrap up warm and talk,"" says Rob, who works in public health for local government. Marie Phillips' mum, Janet, is a nurse. They can't be together either on Mother's Day so she has posted her a grow your own vegetable kit to her keen gardener mother. ""We've all got to find distractions and try to put our energy into something positive,"" says Marie. Planting seeds and waiting for vegetables to grow or flowers to bloom can be a hopeful reminder of better seasons to come. EASY STEPS:What can I do? A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? SYMPTOMS:Should I self-isolate? MAPS AND CHARTS:Visual guide to the outbreak ELDERY:How can we stay in virtual touch For some people, even delivering a card or present won't be an option. Consuelo Martin, in Birmingham, is in self-isolation and plans to send her mum a virtual card, together with a subscription to an online streaming service and Spotify. ""My mum is on her own and I'm worried she is going to get bored in self-isolation. I wanted to make sure she has music and films and television at her fingertips."" For others technology could be the solution. Speaking on BBC Radio 5 this week, Dr Sarah Jarvis said cancelling celebratory lunches and big gatherings would be the most loving and responsible thing for people with elderly mothers to do. Instead, she suggests investing in a mobile phone or tablet and setting up so elderly relatives with Skype or FaceTime. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

She suggests considering using video technology that is integrated on smartphones, tablets and laptops. She says those are often be the most straightforward and easy to use, and to remember that older people may also prefer to use equipment like a mouse rather than a touch screen.

"There's a huge amount of misleading information circulating online about coronavirus - from dodgy health tips to speculation about government plans. This is the story of how one post went viral. It's a list of tips and advice - some true, some benign, and some possibly harmful - which has been circulating on Facebook, WhatsApp, Twitter, and elsewhere. Dubbed the ""Uncle with master's degree"" post because of the alleged source of the information, it's hopped from the Facebook profile of an 84-year-old British man to the Instagram account of a Ghanaian TV presenter, through Facebook groups for Indian Catholics to coronavirus-specific forums, WhatsApp groups, and Twitter accounts. At first glance it seems legitimate because the information is attributed to a trusted source: a doctor, an institution, or that well-educated ""uncle"". The earliest version that we could find was posted by a Facebook user on 7 February. It was shared in a group called Happy People, with nearly 2,000 members. The post read: ""My classmate's uncle and nephew, graduated with a master's degree, and work in Shenzhen Hospital. He is being transferred to study Wuhan pneumonia virus. He just called me and told me to tell my friendsâ¦"" The tips that follow are misleading or wrong. One says that you don't have the virus ""if you have a runny nose"". According to fact checking organisationsFull Fact,externalandSnopes,external, citing health authorities including the US Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and The Lancet medical journal, a runny nose is uncommon - but it's not unheard of among coronavirus patients. The post also encourages people to ""drink more hot water"" and ""Try not to drink ice"". There's currently no medical evidence that either of those things will help prevent or cure coronavirus. ""That has no support,"" says Alex Kasprak of Snopes. ""It's wild to see that in there, it's a big red flag."" We attempted to contact the person who posted the information; she did not respond. Six coronavirus health myths fact-checked The list picked up momentum several days later when it was shared by a man named Glen in India. He put it in several different Facebook groups, including ones for Catholics. The new post built on the 7 February post with additional information. Although the new post stated ""My classmate's uncle and nephew, graduated with a master's degree ... just called me and told me to tell my friends..."", Glen didn't actually receive a phone call from an uncle. He says the post was just ""a forward that I got and forwarded it on"". The additional tips included some accurate advice - for instance, it tells people to wash their hands, a key preventative measure. But the new version also added some unsubstantiated and misleading information. For instance, it described in very specific detail how the disease progresses. But doctors say coronavirus symptoms and severity are highly variable, and there's no one exact progression pattern. For several weeks the post was confined to relatively minor outlets. But on 27 February, an 84-year-old former art gallery owner named Peter made it really go viral. Peter's post was similar to Glen's, but again included some new information - some of which was wrong or misleading. Peter's post spread rapidly, bringing it to the attention of fact checkers including Full Fact and Snopes. Both organisationswrote detailed,externalstoriesdebunking the claims,external, citing reliable medical sources including theWHO,external, the USCDC,external, theUK National Health Service,external(NHS) and others. For instance, one claim in the post stated that the virus ""hates the Sun"". While there is evidence that ultraviolet rays and heat can kill viruses on surfaces, the post claimed that sunlight could cure or prevent the disease in humans. Simply put, going for a walk in the sunshine will not stop coronavirus. Other claims in the post were factual. For instance, it repeated the advice about hand-washing. Peter, who lives in southern England, edited the misleading parts of his post after the fact checkers posted their stories. But by then, it had already been shared nearly 350,000 times. When contacted by the BBC, Peter would not say specifically where he got the information in the post, but said that he trusted his source at the time. ""I believed him actually to be a relation of this scientific guy, a medical guy who'd given all those facts and figures,"" he told us in a phone interview. Peter says he was trying to help people protect themselves. ""I try to be as factual as I can. And if I'm corrected, or if I discover myself that I've said something incorrectly, I apologise and I amend it,"" he says. Coronavirus and ibuprofen: Separating fact from fiction How a misleading coronavirus map went global Doctors fight against coronavirus misinformation Despite his fact-based edits, the claims in the original version of Peter's post soon spread, and mutated. Some versions started to absorb further misleading information. The source shifted as well. In some versions, which moved beyond Facebook to Whatsapp and Twitter, the ""uncle with a master's"" became ""a member of the Stanford hospital board"" and even ""a friend's sister's friend's brother who just happens to be on the Stanford Hospital board"". There was also information attributed to ""Japanese doctors"" and ""Taiwanese experts"" - among many other modifications. The posts mentioning Stanford - at least 100 have appeared on Facebook alone - spread so rapidly that the university issued a statement denying it had anything to do with them. Allow YouTube content?

The post then spread - helped by celebrities, including a Ghanaian TV presenter and an American actor, but also by scores of ordinary people. One American woman posted a version in a Facebook group called Coronavirus Updates - one of thousands of virus-focused groups that have blossomed on the social network. April's post was attributed to ""a friend's nephew in the military"". She explained when contacted via Facebook Messenger that she had seen the information when a friend shared it, but later realised that ""all [my friend] did was copy and paste it like I did. Looks like most of it is false."" ""I use Facebook all day long, everyday,"" April says. ""I have found lots of helpful information... I don't watch the news."" At the same time the post was translated into several languages including Arabic, Amharic, Vietnamese, French, Spanish and Italian. Just a few of the many versions of the post that appeared in different languages Again, some of the posts contained accurate or at the worst benignly misleading information - but other alleged ""facts"" had the potential to be harmful. One piece of advice suggests doing a coronavirus ""self-check"" every morning by holding your breath for more than 10 seconds. Butthere's no evidence,externalto indicate that your ability to do this means you are virus-free. The best of BBC reporting, education and training to help you understand the challenges posed by disinformation and fake news. ""Uncle with a master's"" is a specific type of viral post - the slang term for it is ""copypasta,external"".  This is material that someone copies and pastes instead of using ""share"", ""retweet"", other sharing tools provided within social networks. That makes each post look original: it looks like it was written by someone you know, possibly a friend or relative, thus increasing the chance that you might trust it. Because there are so many ""original"" posts, it also makes it difficult for social networks and people who study them to keep track of exactly how far such posts have spread. We know that Peter's single post was shared hundreds of thousands of times - but it's a colossal, perhaps impossible, task to calculate how many people have seen the various copied variations of ""uncle with a master's"" on Facebook, or any of the major social networks. Clearly though, millions have. This video can not be played A fact-checker's guide to stopping fake news Of the misleading posts that weren't edited to remove misinformation, a Facebook spokesperson told us: ""These posts violate our policies and have been removed."" ""We are working continuously to remove harmful misinformation about coronavirus,"" the spokesperson said. ""Facebook has also partnered with the NHS to connect people to the latest official NHS guidance around coronavirus - both directly in their News Feeds and when people search on the topic."" The company is also plugging the text from the posts into automated systems in order to detect similar content. The tech giants - Facebook, Microsoft, Google, Linkedin, Reddit, Twitter and YouTube -have pledged to work together to fight virus misinformation,external. Fact checkers say that we all have a part to play - by thinking before we share. ""Pause for a second. Have a little look. See if you can find out more information about it,"" says Claire Milne from Full Fact. ""Work out if it's correct or if you are sharing something with your friends and family that might be misleading and could harm them."" If the source seems vague or the post is a long list or thread packed with information, compare the claims to known, trusted sources. Six coronavirus health myths fact-checked Coronavirus and ibuprofen: Separating fact from fiction Doctors fight against coronavirus misinformation The people sharing the ""uncle with a masters"" post - which in its various versions is still spreading online - generally aren't being malicious: they usually believe that they're passing on facts. Or they may be unsure about the veracity of the information, but believe that they're helping anyway, ""just in case"" what's outlined is true. In general, they aren't foolish or stupid. It's easy to get duped if you're anxious. The ""uncle"" post is also a blend of truth and nonsense, which makes it more pernicious and easily spread. ""When things [that are false] are mixed with things that sound reasonable or true, it confuses people, and in some cases, it allows people to think that the rest of the advice is legitimate as well,"" says Mr Kasprak from Snopes. Does the source of the information seem vague or seem to be from a friend of a friend you can't trace?Get to the bottom of where the story came from - or don't share it. Just because you were sent it by somebody you trust, doesn't mean they received the information from someone they actually know. Does all of the information seem true?When there are long lists, it's easy to believe everything in them just because one kernel of advice is correct - that might be the case. Does the content make you emotional - happy, angry or scared?Misinformation goes viral because it plays on our emotions, so that's a sign that it might not be true. Again, dig a bit deeper.

"Children across the UK will be off school for an indefinite period of time because of coronavirus. Some are likely to be anxious, so how can parents help them cope? No school for the ""foreseeable"" future. Exams off. Clubs closed. Millions of children will be looking forward to a spring, and possibly a summer, free of responsibility and routine. But these are not normal times - they're likely to have to spend days and nights indoors with parents or guardians. They won't get much personal contact with friends and, for teenagers, the cancellation of exams will make a difficult time of year even more worrying. ""It's the perfect storm for parents and children,"" says Sam Cartwright-Hatton, professor of clinical child psychology at the University of Sussex. ""It's not just the fact that they're going to be cooped up together. Emotions are also going to be super-stressed because - on top of what young people are feeling - parents are worried about jobs, food supplies, paying the next mortgage bill."" As households begin this forced experiment in enclosed living, Prof Cartwright-Hatton advocates setting a clear routine, particularly for younger children - such as a couple of hours of school work in the morning or a specified time for craft work in the afternoon. She argues that pre-teenage children ""turn inwards quite quickly"" if they spend too much time alone. Parents should play with them and encourage those of an adventurous nature to regard the situation as an ""adventure"". This approach won't work for the more sensitive children who will need extra reassurance. Which children are still going to school? Coronavirus: Keep it simple, stick to facts How families can deal with self-isolating together How to exercise while staying at home Prof Cartwright-Hatton recommends keeping classmates and members of clubs like Brownies, football teams and music groups in touch via Skype, FaceTime, Zoom or other video-conferencing services. This would allow them to share details of their day and play games. ""I would worry about a child who had no-one to play with for six months. We're going to have to get creative in keeping children connected to their peer groups. Kerplunk won't work on Skype, but Cluedo or Monopoly might."" Going out won't be as easy as it usually is, which could add to a feeling of claustrophobia as spring and summer approach. Those with gardens are encouraged to use them for fresh air and exercise. ""A balance has to be struck between mental and physical health, depending on what the next piece of official information is,"" says Eva Lloyd OBE, professor of early childhood at the University of East London. ""If it's safe to go the park, people should do that too."" It's impossible to shield all but the youngest children from coronavirus talk, particularly with parents turning on TVs at 17:00 GMT for the latest government briefing. But Prof Cartwright-Hatton suggests not exposing under-10s to any news at all, except in tailored forms such as theBBC's Newsround,which consults experts on its likely psychological impact. Teenagers are better equipped to make their own judgements, but they should not be left in their rooms for hours on end searching the internet or using social media unsupervised, she warns. LIVE COVERAGE:Latest from the BBC EASY STEPS:How to keep safe A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? GETTING READY:How prepared is the UK? PUBLIC TRANSPORT:What's the risk? Another potential outcome of so much information coming children's way - along with a great deal of advice, such as standing two metres away from grandparents to avoid possible transmission - is ""guilt"", says Prof Lloyd. ""I worry that they'll wonder whether this is happening because of something they've done,"" she adds. ""It's a very strange situation for them. We've got to show them that none of this is their fault and that children throughout the world are going through the same experience."" Coronavirus news is grim for people of all ages, but parents can offer perspective. ""Downplay their fears but be realistic,"" says Prof Cartwright-Hilton. ""Don't promise things that you can't be sure aren't true. If there's misinformation about the number of deaths from coronavirus, you can counter that. ""But, whenever you've discussed coronavirus, move on afterwards, so children don't spend too much time thinking about it."" Students who were due to take their GCSEs, A-levels, Highers and other exams have had them cancelled. They don't know when or if they will go ahead at a future date. Teenagers who would otherwise be revising could now be at home wondering how they will get their qualifications. ""I'd listen and be very sympathetic,"" says Prof Cartwright-Hatton. ""Whatever emotions the situation is throwing up, tell them you understand how awful it must be at the moment and what a shame it is. ""But let them know you can't solve this for them. If they are really catastrophising about it - worrying that they won't go to university and won't get a job - correct that, because it's not the case."" The situation the UK finds itself in is new for parents and children. Prof Lloyd says families should hold a ""review"" at the end of every week to discuss how the arrangement is faring. ""It's going to be challenging,"" she says. ""If it's not working, people will need to change it. We should include the children in discussions. From the age of about two they will want to have an input."" Discussions between parents over their own coronavirus worries can wait until after children have gone to bed, Prof Lloyd adds. At the best of times, children are inclined to ask: ""Are we nearly there yet?"" or ""Is it nearly over?"" Explaining the word ""indefinite"" might prove problematic. ""For young children that's an emerging concept,"" says Prof Lloyd. ""You get them to imagine the summer holidays, that it would be long like them, but not so much fun."" It's a daunting prospect for parents, taking over what the state has offered for well over a century - daytime education and childcare. But might there be another way of looking at things to ensure the coming weeks and months are more bearable? ""We often talk about work-life balance and parents not being able to spend enough time with kids,"" says Prof Cartwright-Hatton. ""That's not going to be a problem for a lot of people for quite a while now. We've got to look for the silver lining in all this.""

"Everyone should avoid non-essential contact with others to prevent the spread of the coronavirus, the prime minister has said. As schools shut and some people work from home, many are feeling cut off from their everyday hobbies and social lives. But the internet offers a means to stay connected and to keep us all entertained and educated through the days of isolation. Here are just some of the ways people are already using technology to lift their spirits. Groups have also been finding innovative ways to socialise, hosting dinner parties and even Brownies meetings online. Gooseâs Quizzes has swapped the pub for the internet Goose's Quizzes usually runs 45 pub quizzes in Scotland, but has started doing live online sessions every night, with hundreds participating. ""It's been a pretty bad couple of weeks and pub quizzes bring the community together,"" says Andrew Wildgoose, founder of Goose's Quizzes. ""So we wanted to find a way for people to still enjoy them."" Even book clubs are operating digitally, with private WhatsApp groups forming to share reading lists and Rebel Book Club launching a 14-day free reading challenge for anyone who needs extra accountability. Reading doesn't need to be a solitary pursuit People have also been downloading the free Google Chrome extension Netflix Party, which allows users to watch Netflix together. It synchronises screens and creates a group chat to communicate. For those craving some culture, museums and galleries have been posting on social media under the hashtag #museumfromhome, showcasing their collections. Allow Twitter content?

One exhibition at God's House Tower in Southampton is having a ""virtual launch"" on Saturday, as the venue has shut due to coronavirus. Godâs House Tower art gallery ""We're really devastated that the venue has to close temporarily,"" says Daniel Crow, director of the gallery. ""Hopefully, this will allow people around the world, not just those local, to see it. ""It really does herald a new era in God's House Tower's fascinating 700-year-old history by presenting art exhibitions online."" Exercise classes have moved from gyms to online, creating videos or ""lives"" on Instagram and Facebook. Many fitness clubs, including Barry's, Crossfit and David Lloyd, are providing online workouts people can do at home. Amanda Dufour, a yoga instructor who is currently self-isolating, has filmed YouTube videos to follow and has been teaching classes via Zoom and Skype. ""The best thing about yoga is that you can do it anywhere, with no equipment,"" she says. ""It really gives you a chance to take a break from work, stay calm and process everything that's going on. Amanda Dufour is teaching yoga via video chat apps ""Stretching can make a big difference if you're hunched up on a laptop all day at home."" Free video appointments with vets are also being offered on the FirstVet app until the end of April. Users are paired with a qualified vet who can give advice and refer the patient to a physical service if necessary. Vets can help provide pet owners with advice online David Prien, the firm's co-founder, says there's been an 80% rise in people using the app over the past few weeks. ""Just because you're in isolation doesn't mean your pet stays healthy,"" he adds, noting that it also gives vets who are housebound something to keep them occupied. People are also signing up to dog-walking apps, such as Borrow My Doggy, to walk the pets of those who cannot because of new working arrangements or self-isolation. Allow Twitter content?

You can also sign up for a daily briefing on the pandemic here.It'll be emailed to you each morning. Canadaâs Foreign Minister FranÃ§ois-Philippe Champagne has been tested for Covid-19 after experiencing âflu-like symptomsâ after returning from abroad. He will self-isolate as he awaits results âvery shortlyâ. âI will continue to work around the clock to support Canadians,â Champagne said, urging citizens to practice self distancing and âtake all necessary precautions to protect each otherâ. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is also in self-isolation after his wife tested positive for the virus, though Trudeau himself has shown no symptoms. Froeign Minister FranÃ§ois-Philippe Champagne is awaiting coronavirus test results The Czech government has pledged $40 billion (Â£35 billion) to businesses so they can pay their workers' wages. Prime Minister Andrej Babis said the money would be made up of $4bn in aid, and the rest would be loan guarantees, so firms can weather the huge losses caused by the coronavirus pandemic. On Thursday the Czech Republic reported 134 new cases of the illness in 24 hours, bringing its total up to 694. All countries are under pressure to try to mitigate the impact of the crisis on their economies and citizens. The UK government is set to announce further measures on Friday. From one city to another and soldiers in medical masks have now sealed off Amman from the rest of Jordan as a lockdown comes into force. Army checkpoints have been established on main entrances to the capital, as a travel ban came into force that only allows entry to essential goods or people with authorised business. Army spokesman Brigadier General Mukhles al Mufleh told state media the measures were ""to prevent the spread of the virus"". Today the number of confirmed cases in Jordan rose by 13 people to 69.

and 25 million gloves are needed ""by early in April"", New York's mayor said, ""for us to ensure that our healthcare system, public and
private, can bear the brunt of the coronavirus crisis."" The cry for help comes
as New York City reports a total of 3,615 confirmed Covid-19 cases, and 22
deaths. ""This is going to
be one of the most difficult moments in New York City history,"" de Blasio
said. De Blasio
yesterday called upon the US military to intervene in the coronavirus
outbreak in his city ""I want their
medical teams, I want their logistical support... the only force in
America that can do that effectively and quickly,"" he said. Following that sad news on the death toll in Italy, Pope Francis has led a televised service from the Vatican this evening to pray for an end to the pandemic. Italy's bishops asked Catholics to say the rosary in their homes at 21:00 local time (20:00 GMT) and to put a lighted candle in their windows, as a sign of national unity. The request spread on social media after it was announced earlier this week, and many Catholics across the world joined in. In a broadcast message before the prayers, Pope Francis said: ""In this unprecedented situation, when everything seems to be vacillating, let us help each other remain steady in what really matters.""

The latest episode of the BBC's daily podcast covering the pandemic has just been released. It includes the latest from Italy, where today the death toll surpassed that in China. As the
virus continues its spread through all 50 states, plus Washington, DC, the
number of confirmed cases in the US has climbed to11,274. Across the country,157 people have died, with
concentrated clusters on the countryâs West Coast - namely Washington state and
California - and New York. The US
State Department hasissued
a Level 4 warning- the highest possible - advising US citizens to avoid all international travel
and, for those abroad, to âarrange for immediate return to the United States,
unless they are prepared to remain abroad for an indefinite periodâ. Amid
rising panic - and sustained criticism of the administration for its response
to the outbreak - President Donald Trump said on Thursdayhe would rush the
development of vaccines and treatmentsâas fast as it can possibly be doneâ for Covid-19. He announced earlier this
week that human testing on a vaccine trial had begun. US
lawmakers are moving to pass a $1 trillion - or larger - emergency aid package

cheques to American taxpayers,
and $2,400 to families. As businesses are forced to shutter, first-time claims
for unemployment insurance have surged, crashing government
unemployment websites. We've just been told that Taoiseach (Irish Prime Minister) Leo Varadkar and UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson have spoken by phone about the crisis. The former has welcomed the UK's decision to close schools. The Irish government said the move had brought a ""greater closeness"" between the positions in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland. The two men agreed on the need to ""keep in contact and align their actions"" in response to the coronavirus pandemic, ""in so far as possible"". BBC Question Time has come to an end, but it will continue in its new prime time slot next week. For more debate on the issues from tonight's show, listen into BBC Radio 5 Live now for Question Time Extra Time with Adrian Chiles. BBC Question Time The last question tonight is about how qualifications will be awarded to schoolchildren given exams have been cancelled. Union chief Frances O'Grady says a solution must be fair to pupils, noting teachers are ""desperate"" for clear guidance. She also calls on the government to make clear who will be defined as a ""key worker"" and able to carry on sending their children to school. Health Secretary Matt Hancock says guidance on qualifications will be made available ""as fast as we possibly can"". He says we'll have to wait for tomorrow for news on key workers - but NHS and social care workers, as well as those who make medical devices, will be on the list. BBC Question Time Frances O'Grady says it has been like ""survival of the fittest"" in supermarkets The topic of panic buying raises its ugly head on BBC's Question Time next. Union chief Frances O'Grady says: ""When I looked at some of those supermarket shelves, people sweeping up toilet roll and soap, it is almost like survival of the fittest. ""When we are scared, we often think of our families first, but as a community, we have to think about our neighbours, workmates, the elderly, and screw our heads on."" Health Secretary Matt Hancock praises supermarkets like Iceland who have introduced ""silver hours"" to ensure the elderly can come to shop and get supplies. But he says measures to stop mass buying ""have to be governed by supermarkets"" - not by orders through government. Instead he appeals to ""every single person who is fit and healthy"" to ""check the door on left, check the door on the right, the door over the road, and in a respectful, community way we will find help for lots of people"". He concludes: ""Everybody can play a part."" Read more on the steps shops are taking to combat stockpiling.And ourbusiness editor Simon Jack explainswhy supermarkets are drastically cutting their ranges amid the coronavirus crisis. What's happening in your part of the country?We've been tracking all the updatesto give you the clearest picture possible. Remember, though, that while a total of 3,269 cases of coronavirus have been confirmed in the UK, the actual number is estimated to be between 35,000 and 50,000. After UK Health Secretary Matt Hancock discussed efforts being made to get more essential kit to the NHS front line, we've learned that as many as 65,000 retired doctors and nurses could go back to work to help tackle the spread of coronavirus. The NHS has asked former employees who have left in the past three years to re-register with the regulatory bodies and ""boost the ranks"" of its staff. Those who return to work will be able to opt in to a register to fill a range of roles - clinical and non-clinical - based on their skills and how much time they have spent away from work. Ruth May, chief nursing officer for England, said: ""As the health service gears up to deal with the greatest global health threat in its history, my message to former colleagues is 'Your NHS Needs You'."" BBC Question Time Labour's Andy Burnham asks about help for low income workers As we said, Health Secretary Matt Hancock is being questioned about the help for businesses. He's pushed hard by Labour Mayor Andy Burnham ahead of an announcement by the chancellor tomorrow on more support. Mr Burnham says he has a lot of sympathy for the government, but they have ""taken a lot of measures that sounded good but they have not given all the answers"". The former minister accuses the government of ""doing the least for people who need help the most"" - such as those in insecure employment, the self-employed, and those already on benefits out of work. ""Those people can't follow government advice to self isolate, they have to go into work, they should have been first group to be helped,"" adds Mr Burnham. Mr Hancock says the government changed rules in the Budget just a week ago to help those people, and agrees the government must help businesses to keep people in work ""because it is the best way to be ready to bounce back"". He refuses to reveal what the Chancellor Rishi Sunak will announce tomorrow when it comes to the amount people are given on statutory sick pay - around Â£94 per week - but concludes: ""Mark my words, we will do everything we can to make sure people are supported through this."" Question Time has moved on to questions around pay for workers struggling amid the crisis - including the self-employed, those on zero-hours contracts or those forced to stay off to look after family.

BBC Question Time Back to Question Time and a viewer asks when frontline NHS staff will be tested after lots of complaints to the media by health workers. Dr Tom Solomon says it is critical to test NHS workers, but said Public Health England created a test ""as soon as they possibly could"". However, union chief Frances O'Grady says she is concerned by reports from staff not being able to get tested. ""Health staff and staff in social care are putting their health on the line for us, least they deserve is to get tests,"" she adds. The Mayor of Greater Manchester, Labour's Andy Burnham, says services in his area also don't feel testing is happening fast enough and wonders if ""the eye was taken off the ball"" by the government. But Health Secretary Matt Hancock says tests are increasing everyday. He says he has today spent some of his department's cash today on new tests that work more like pregnancy tests - mentioned by the PM earlier - which makes it quicker to get results. He adds: ""Testing is the way to get a grip on this curve and hopefully, in time, reduce some of the incredibly draconian measures."" He also says that by next week, every social care provider will have protective equipment. A quick round-up of some of the top coronavirus news stories for you as Question Time carries on:  And some other interesting or helpful pieces you might like: For the first time in the history of Question Time there is no studio audience because of the social distancing measures currently in place - but the people of Weston-super-Mare have recorded questions to be played in via video link.

"Budget airline EasyJet has asked pilots and cabin crew to agree to sweeping changes in their terms and conditions, as part of its response to coronavirus. Among the proposed changes are a freeze on planned pay rises and a requirement to take three months of unpaid leave. The airline would also no longer provide food for crew during their shifts, only water. Unions told members they had failed to reach agreement with the airline and were working on counter-proposals. However, there remains a willingness to make concessions in order to avoid redundancies. Further talks between EasyJet and unions representing pilots and cabin crew are expected today. Meanwhile, EasyJet's chief executive Johan Lundgren has defended the payment of Â£170m in dividends to shareholders, at a time when the company is seeking financial help from the government. EasyJet Chief Executive Johan Lundgren defended the dividend payments to shareholders (pictured in 2018) On Wednesday, EasyJet's recently-appointed chief operating officer Peter Bellew met delegates from the pilots' union Balpa and Unite, which represents cabin crew. Under discussion was a proposed ""coronavirus cooperation agreement"" setting out changes to employees' terms and conditions. It would be in force from 23 March 2020 until 15 November 2021. Both sides acknowledge that action is needed. Travel restrictions across Europe have forced it to cancel many of its flights and ground more than a third of its fleet. The airline needs to save cash, and the unions want to preserve jobs. However, sources say the proposals themselves provoked an angry response. The four-page document would allow the airline to cancel pay rises until 2021, make significant changes to working patterns, and allow it to defer pay rises for newly-promoted captains for six months. Pilots in particular seem aggrieved by the plan. According to messages seen by the BBC, negotiators agreed to reject it on the principle that there was ""no evidence that the current crisis warrants such an extensive change in terms and conditions for such a long period, particularly when so many of them are so critically linked to flight safety and fatigue"". Balpa has refused to comment, as the talks are ongoing. Unite, meanwhile, has taken a softer tone. The union denied reports it had told the airline that compulsory redundancies were preferable to the deal on the table. ""Unite is very much still in talks with EasyJet and it is totally untrue to suggest the union has rejected all the company's proposals"", it said in a statement. However, insiders told the BBC they shared concerns that the airline might be using the current crisis as an excuse to change working practices, and erode employees' pay and benefits in the long term. In a statement, the company said: ""EasyJet has met with its employee representatives in the UK to discuss how they can help the airline navigate through these unprecedented timesâ¦ ""Like all airlines we are taking every action to remove cost and non-critical expenditure from the business at every level to help mitigate the impact from the Covid-19 pandemic."" Airlines warn they may not survive without bailout Edinburgh Airport to cut 100 jobs over passenger number warnings Meanwhile, EasyJet's chief executive has told the BBC the company is asking for government loans to help it weather the crisis. He said the company was ""first and foremost"" trying to save cash. But he added: ""Since we don't know how long this thing will last we also think it's appropriate that we're also looking for financing being supported as well from the government."" Such support, he said, would take the form of ""loans on a commercial basis"". He defended a Â£170m dividend to shareholders, due to be made tomorrow, saying it had already been signed off - and the company was legally obliged to make the payment. EasyJet says Mr Lundgren, Mr Bellew and Chief Financial Officer Andrew Findlay have all elected to take a 20% cut in their monthly salary from April to June.
