"Justin Edinburgh, who has died aged 49, managed sides in three Wembley finals Leyton Orient manager Justin Edinburgh has died at the age of 49 - five days after suffering a cardiac arrest. Edinburgh, who guided Orient back into the English Football League in 2018-19, had beentaken to hospital on Monday. ""We are completely heartbroken by this tragedy,"" Orient chairman Nigel Travis told the club's website. Edinburgh, who won the FA Cup as a Spurs player, managed Northampton Town, Gillingham and Newport County before moving to Orient in November 2017. ""All our thoughts and love are with the Edinburgh family and we know from the messages that have flooded into the club over the last week that the wider football world will share our sentiments,"" added Travis. ""The success that Justin brought to Leyton Orient was incredible, but more importantly the impact he had on us all as a winner and a wonderful, inspirational human being will be his legacy and will stay with us forever. ""All our thoughts are with Justin's wife Kerri and their children Charlie and Cydnie."" After turning professional at Southend, Edinburgh - a left-back - spent a decade playing for Tottenham, making 258 appearances and winning the FA Cup in 1991 and League Cup in 1999 before moving to Portsmouth. He became player-manager of non-league Billericay Town in 2003 before spells at Fisher Athletic and Rushden and Diamonds. His managerial breakthrough came at Newport County, whom he led to promotion to League Two in 2013 having guided them to the FA Trophy final a year earlier. A 23-month spell at Gillingham from January 2015 followed, before nine months at Northampton in 2016-2017. He was appointed Orient boss in November of 2017, and led the club to 45 wins in his 82 games in charge. Edinburgh celebrated promotion with Orient less than two months ago Orient captainJobi McAnufftweeted a picture of himself and Edinburgh celebrating this season's National League title, saying: ""Totally and utterly devastated. You were so much more than a manager to me. ""Just doesn't feel real coming so soon after sharing some of my happiest moments with you. My thoughts, love and prayers go to the family at this truly terrible time. R.I.P Justin."" Orient strikerMacauley Bonnetweeted: ""There are no words to describe the loss of our gaffer, our leader & inspiration. He brought us all together - we're eternally grateful for everything you've done."" Fellow forwardJames Alabisaid he was ""absolutely broken"" while defenderJamie Turleysaid he was: ""Devastated and lost for words at the loss of this great man. It was an honour to play for him. Truly an amazing and inspirational person in all aspects."" DefenderMarvin Ekpitetatweeted he was ""lost for words"" while wingerJames Brophyposted: ""A wonderful man, who had a positive impact on everyone he met no matter how much time you'd spent with him! Never be forgotten! Thank you for everything."" Leyton Orient Fans' Trustsaid in a statement that in his 18 months at the club, ""Justin became an Orient legend"". They added: ""When Justin arrived, the team was still struggling but his shrewd and tenacious management helped turn our performances around and give us a team we could be proud of - one of the most likeable Orient teams we have known. ""He was clearly deeply liked and admired by his players, who owe him a great deal."" Former Orient chairmanBarry Hearntweeted: ""Words fall short of the sadness this news brings. A lovely man who achieved so much for Leyton Orient. He shall not be forgotten."" BBC London's Orient reporterDave Victor,who has reported on the club for several years, tweeted: ""It was an enormous pleasure and a privilege to have known and worked with him. ""Justin achieved so much with The O's and we knew it was just the beginning."" BBC Sport Wales reporter Michael Pearlman, who covered Newport County for the local newspaper when Justin was manager: It is no surprise to see such a rush from people within football paying tribute to Justin Edinburgh. While he spent virtually his entire playing career at the top level, Edinburgh had to do it the tough way in management, starting at the bottom. Because of his character and ability, Edinburgh thrived at Billericay, Fisher and Rushden before I encountered him when he arrived at Newport County. Just as he did with Orient - either side of spells at Gillingham and Northampton - he took a club on its knees and made it proud again, going from relegation worries to promotion in unthinkably quick time. Players adored him because he knew how they wanted to be treated, and we as journalists loved him because whatever the result, he was always happy to be available and accountable, happy to talk morning, noon or night. He even texted me on my wedding day. I saw him go above and beyond in giving his time to supporters and the community time and time again and will remember him very fondly for his sense of humour, passion for football and, mainly, his dedication to his family. His loss will be felt enormously. Edinburgh (centre holding FA Cup) played alongside Gary Lineker and Paul Gascoigne at Tottenham Edinburgh was in the Spurs side that beat Nottingham Forest in the 1991 FA Cup final. Gary Lineker,a team-mate that day and now BBC Match of the Day presenter, tweeted: ""Deeply saddened to hear that Justin Edinburgh has passed away. ""He was an excellent coach and a terrific full-back who was a delight to share a dressing room with and have as a team-mate."" Former Spurs captainLedley Kingposted: ""I can't believe this. Saw Justin last week and he was in great shape and full of life. He was genuinely one of the nicest guys you could meet. Thoughts and prayers to his family. RIP mate."" Paul Stewart,who scored Spurs' equaliser in the 1991 final said he was ""gutted"" whileSteve Sedgleytweeted: ""Devastated, A sad, sad, day, a truly great person."" Another former Tottenham teammate,David Ginola,tweeted: ""Justin Edinburgh....deeply shocked, deeply saddened... RIP my friend, I shall miss you."" Meanwhile, former Spurs player and managerGlenn Hoddletweeted he was ""devastated"" by ""the very sad and tragic news"". Edinburgh's former club tweeted their condolences Edinburgh's former clubs were also among those to express their grief. Southend,his first team as a player, sent their ""thoughts and heartfelt condolences"" to Edinburgh's family and friends and ""everyone at Leyton Orient"".

"This video can not be played Police moved in and made arrests as protesters gathered outside the court A Russian investigative journalist, Ivan Golunov, has been arrested in the capital Moscow and charged with trying to illegally sell drugs. He was placed under house arrest after a court hearing. Earlier, he was given a medical examination amid reports he had been injured during the arrest. The reporter for Latvia-based news site Meduza was detained on Thursday. His lawyer says drugs were planted on him, an accusation the Russian authorities deny. Meduza says Mr Golunov, 36, is being ""being persecuted because of his journalistic activity"". The court rejected a request by investigators to keep him in custody. He reporter had been on his way to meet another journalist on Thursday when he was stopped and searched by officers. They say they found the synthetic drug mephedrone in his rucksack, and that a later search of his flat turned up more drugs and some scales - indicating that he was involved in dealing. Investigative journalist Ivan Golunov was arrested on Thursday The journalist was officially charged on Saturday morning with attempting illegally to produce, sell or pass on drugs. Police released photos which they said showed drug paraphernalia in Mr Golunov's flat, but these were later withdrawn, BBC Russian journalist Olga Ivshina reports. Russia laws ban 'disrespect' of government and 'fake news' Russia to make its own show about Chernobyl The police, she adds, admitted that ""most of the published photos had not been taken at Mr Golunov's flat after all, but were related to another criminal investigation that might be linked to his detention"". Meduza said in a statement that Mr Golunov had received threats in recent months over a story he was working on. ""We are convinced that Ivan Golunov is innocent,"" the statement reads, according to Reuters news agency. ""Moreover, we have grounds to believe that Golunov is being persecuted because of his journalistic activity."" by Nataliya Zotova, BBC Russian reporter Ivan Golunov's friends and journalists have been waiting outside the court building since the morning, showing their support for a colleague they believe has been wrongly arrested. ""I don't believe we can change anything standing there. But what else can we do?"" Evgeny Buntman of Ekho Moskvy, one of few independent radio stations in Russia, wondered aloud. ""People come here not because they can be of help here, but because of a deep feeling of helplessness."" In the courtroom, Golunov cried when he saw his friends and colleagues. Everyone was expecting him to be jailed while he awaited trial. Instead, the judge decided on house arrest. The angry screams of the crowd outside instantly transformed into yelps of joy which carried through the open windows into the courtroom. Now, it was Golunov's friends to cry - out of relief. A medical examination at Moscow's Hospital Number 71 showed that he had an abrasion on his back and bruising around one eye but no serious injuries that required a stay in hospital, Dr Alexander Myasnikov told Russian media. None of his ribs were broken, he added, after earlier claims that he had suffered a fracture. Meduza says he was beaten up by officers both during his arrest and later at a police station. He was, the news site says, only able to contact a friend after 14 hours. In the first video of Mr Golunov since his arrest, posted by the Russian news site Breaking Mash, he lifts up his shirt to reveal marks on his back. Allow Twitter content?

Mr Golunov said he had been involved in ""scuffles"" with police, and showed bruises. His lawyer, Dmitry Julay, told reporters that the journalist had been denied food and sleep for more than 24 hours. The journalist has repeatedly exposed corruption among Moscow's high-profile businesspeople and its political elite, as well as fraudulent financial schemes in the city. Journalists in Russia have often been harassed or attacked in recent years for their work. Many opposition figures and human rights activists in Russia have been detained on apparently fabricated drugs charges, which are widely seen as an attempt to quash political dissent. Much of Russia's media is controlled by the state andRussia is ranked 83rd out of 100 countries for press freedom by Freedom House,external. Mr Golunov's mother Svetlana (centre) with Galina Timchenko ""We will find out by whose will Vanya [Ivan] is being pursued, and we will make this information public,"" Meduza's director Galina Timchenko and editor Ivan Kolpakov said. ""We will protect our journalist by all available means."" The journalist's arrest sparked protests in Moscow and St Petersburg, andmore than a dozen people - mostly fellow journalists - were reportedly detained,externaland later released. On Saturday, police detained several people trying to protest about the arrest outside Nikulinsky Court, with one placard condemning the case against the reporter as a ""fabrication"". Mr Golunov's mother, Svetlana Golunova, told Reuters the arrest was ""not even a farce, it is something unbelievable"", and she expected ""only victory"".

While Ben Stokes bowled excellently at the lower order for three wickets after dismissing Shakib... Bangladesh's best partnership was again between Mushfiqur Rahim and Shakib. Liam Plunkett dismissed Mushfiqur to break it... After a brilliant batting display, England were also excellent with the ball. Jofra Archer was intimidating up top. He bowled Souyma Sarkar with a stunning delivery - the first wicket of the innings... He then nipped in with two at the end to close out the match... England skipper Eoin Morgan:""We knew we had to improve with the bat, we were outstanding and Jason got a good score. He's very intimidating to play against so the impact that has on our team is very significant. The majority of people will open with spin but there are always things to throw against us. Hopefully we can counter all the plans thrown at us. The bowlers were all outstanding, they are wonderful to captain."" On Jos Buttler's injury:""No serious concern with Jos at the moment. He didn't keep wicket as a precaution after he felt his hip, but it will be monitored over the next 48 hours."" Bangladesh centurion Shakib Al Hasan:""Very happy with the way I played but we didn't start well with the ball and when they got the start they capitalised and we had to play the catch up game. Credit goes to the England batsmen. We need to pick ourselves up because there are plenty of games left.""

In the first four or five overs we had control but after England took over. We knew we had to get Roy out and then we could have got back into the match. Asked if he would change his decision to bowl first if given the chance:""I think so. The pitch had been one and a half days under cover so the straightforward decision should have been to field. Sometimes you need a bit of luck to get those early wickets. 320 or 330 could have been a different chase. On centurion Shakib Al Hasan:""From the first match he has been playing so well for us. His bowling also has been fantastic. He is performing so well at the moment. There is a long way to go, hopefully the other players will step up. The next two or three matches will be very important for us."" Michael VaughanEx-England captain on TMS Buttler is a terrific player to have, you can't set fields to him and these boundaries are just not big enough for him. The World Cup is back on track. Here's the final wicket for the match, taken by Jofra Archer. It was another vicious bouncer and sealed England's win. Liam Plunkett:""Another great partnership up top, it's always nice to get runs on the board. We took our time and got ourselves in and got a monster score. It's obviously nice to get in at number eight and strike a few balls. It's nice to keep to our standards with the ball, it was a bit swirly but I bowled my eight overs into the wind and it was a good performance.""

He and Eoin Morgan contributed in the middle order with good knocks which helped propel England to their highest total in a World Cup. Buttler scored 64 from 44 balls with trademark big shots... The only worry was the injury he seemed to pick up when hitting this six. He did not take to the field in the second innings. Michael VaughanEx-England captain on TMS If England can clear out the peripheral nonsense - against Pakistan they were agitated - it's about the mentality going forward. Was Jason Roy distracted by hitting six sixes in an over when he got out? He hit three in a row before skying one up for a simple catch... Man of the match Jason Roy:""It was great to right those wrongs from the last game. Jonny and myself didn't quite know what the pitch was going to behave like so we knew with our line-up batting the whole 50 we were going to get enough. We've put in a well rounded performance so I'm extremely happy with the boys."" Jason Roy and Jonny Bairstow had to battle early. They were very smart.

"MPs are to launch an inquiry into the UK's steel industry after the collapse of one of the sector's biggest firms. The move by the Business Committee follows theliquidation of British Steellast month and concerns about the impact of Brexit on the steel industry. The committee will look at the role of former owner Greybull Capital, and the government, in the company's collapse. MPs said they wanted to hold public evidence sessions with Greybull and the business secretary, among others. British Steel was placed into compulsory liquidation on 22 May, putting 5,000 jobs at risk and endangering 20,000 in the supply chain. It followed a breakdown in rescue talks between the government and private equity firm Greybull. The government is covering the firm's wage bill for now, but if a new buyer cannot be found it could be wound up and redundancies would follow. The Official Receiver has said it hasmade contact with more than 80 potential buyers. British Steel collapse threatens 5,000 jobs Why is steel in the news? British Steel failure: The role of Greybull Rachel Reeves, who chairs the Business Committee, said: ""It is vital that the government and Official Receiver do all they can to secure a viable future for British Steel. ""However, as a select committee we want to examine questions around the collapse of British Steel and the government's approach, as well as about Greybull Capital's stewardship and its commitments to investing in its future. ""More broadly, we want to examine the serious challenges facing the future of the steel sector in the UK."" Ms Reeves said the inquiry would examine the serious challenges being faced by the steel sector in the UK. She said long-term industry concerns on issues like energy costs and business rates had been ""largely unaddressed"" by the government. The inquiry will also explore whether additional responsibilities should be required of the owners of national strategic assets. Unite's assistant general secretary Steve Turner welcomed the inquiry, adding: ""We need to look seriously at how a strategically important national industry has ended up in such a perilous, uncertain place, and then we need government to take the steps necessary to bring security to the sector."" He added that it was right that Greybull's role in the collapse was thoroughly examined. Greybull bought the business for Â£1 from Tata during depths of the 2016 steel crisis in the hopes of turning the business around, going on to rebrand it as British Steel. It hadsought financial support from the governmentbefore it was placed in liquidation. The firm was hit by a slump in orders from European customers âdue to uncertainty over Brexit, as well as a weakening in the pound since the 2016 EU referendum.

"This video can not be played A look at the steps Mexico is taking to deal with migrants President Donald Trump has hailed a deal reached with Mexico to help stem the flow of migrants to the US after he threatened to impose trade tariffs. Under the deal, in which Mexico agreed to take ""unprecedented steps"", the duties that were due to come into effect on Monday have been suspended. ""Mexico will try very hard, and if they do that, this will be a very successful agreement,"" said Mr Trump. There were fears that the tariffs could hurt US businesses and consumers. Under Mr Trump's proposal, duties would have risen by 5% every month on goods including cars, beer, tequila, fruit and vegetables until they hit 25% in October. The deal was reached at the end of three days of negotiations which saw Washington demand a crackdown on Central American migrants. In a joint declaration released by the US state department, the two countries said Mexico would take ""unprecedented steps"" to curb irregular migration and human trafficking. But it seems the US did not get one of its reported key demands, which would have required Mexico to take in asylum seekers heading for the US and process their claims on its own soil. Under the deal, Mexico agreed to: Deploy its National Guard throughout the country from Monday, pledging up to 6,000 additional troops along Mexico's southern border with Guatemala Take ""decisive action"" to tackle human smuggling networks The US agreed to: Expand its programme of sending asylum seekers back to Mexico while they await reviews of their claims. In return, the US will ""work to accelerate"" the adjudication process Both countries pledged to ""strengthen bilateral co-operation"" over border security, including ""co-ordinated actions"" and information sharing. Is there a crisis on the US-Mexico border? Trump's border wall - in seven charts This video can not be played Five numbers that explain why the current US border situation is different The declaration added that discussions would continue, and final terms would be accepted and announced within 90 days. Should Mexico's actions ""not have the expected results"", the agreement warned that additional measures could be taken but did not specify what these would be. In one of a series of tweets about the deal, Mr Trump quoted National Border Patrol Council president Brandon Judd as saying:""That's going to be a huge deal,externalbecause Mexico will be using their strong Immigration Laws - A game changer. People no longer will be released into the U.S."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Mexican Foreign Secretary Marcelo Ebrard told journalists: ""I think it was a fair balance, because they have more drastic measures and proposals at the start, and we have reached some middle point."" Speaking at a separate news conference, US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said ""we couldn't be more pleased with the agreement"". Mr Trump caught members of his own party unaware when he announced the proposed tariffs last week. By Will Grant, BBC Mexico and Central America correspondent It's still unclear whether it was internal pressure within his party or the measures being offered by Mexico that dissuaded Mr Trump from implementing the plan, or perhaps simply an appreciation of its potential consequences. It became apparent during the talks just how intertwined the two neighbouring economies are, and many argued that a 5% tax on all Mexican goods would hurt US suppliers and customers too. Furthermore, damaging the already fragile Mexican economy could have pushed it into a full recession and created more migrants heading north in search of work. Still, some considered the bilateral meetings were useful, in part to recognise that both nations are facing a steep rise in undocumented immigration. The plan to deploy military personnel to Mexico's southern border may well have helped bring this dispute to an end. However, President Trump has now tied immigration to bilateral trade and could easily do so again in the future should the situation fail to improve. Mexico is currently one of the largest trading partners of the US, just behind China and Canada - two countries also locked in trade disputes with the US. President AndrÃ©s Manuel LÃ³pez Obrador ran for office vowing to stand up to the US and once said he would not allow Mexico to be Mr Trump's ""whipping boy"". But some Mexican politicians felt he had given too much, too quickly, and they demanded to see details of the deal. Ãngel Ãvila Romero, a senior member of the left-wing PRD party, said the agreement was ""not a negotiation, it was a surrender"". ""Mexico should not militarise its southern border. We are not the backyard of Donald Trump,"" he tweeted. This video can not be played Why are Africans in Mexico heading to US? Marko CortÃ©s, leader of the conservative National Action Party (PAN), said the sovereignty and dignity of Mexico had been damaged, newspaper El Universal reported. Who is President LÃ³pez Obrador? Mr LÃ³pez Obrador said on Twitter that a rally in the border city of Tijuana on Saturday to celebrate Mexican sovereignty would go ahead. On Wednesday, US Customs and Border Protection said migrant detentions had surged in May to the highest level in more than a decade - 132,887 arrests, a 33% increase from April. The detentions were the highest monthly total since Mr Trump took office. Official figures show illegal border crossings had been in decline since 2000. In 2000, 1.6 million people were apprehended trying to cross the border illegally - that number was just under 400,000 in 2018. In 2017, Mr Trump's first year in office, the figures were the lowest they had been since 1971. But the number of arrests has been rising again, especially in recent months. In February, Mr Trump declared an emergency on the US-Mexico border, saying it was necessary in order to tackle what he claimed was a crisis. Is there a crisis on the border?

"Ashleigh Barty sealed victory on her first match point after 70 minutes 2019 French Open Venue:Roland Garros, ParisDates:26 May-9 June Coverage:Live text and radio commentary on selected matches on the BBC Sport website and app. Australian Ashleigh Barty has beaten Czech teenager Marketa Vondrousova in the French Open final to win her first Grand Slam singles title and complete a fairytale return to the sport. The eighth seed won 6-1 6-3 against 19-year-old Vondrousova on the Paris clay. Barty, 23, quit tennis to play professional cricket in 2014, but returned to the sport 17 months later. Now she is the first Australian to win a singles titles at Roland Garros since Margaret Court in 1973. After thumping away an overhead on her first match point, Barty turned to her team and raised her hands in the air, placing them on her head in disbelief before dropping to her haunches on the red dirt. ""It is unbelievable, I'm a little speechless, I played almost the perfect match,"" Barty said. ""It has been a crazy two weeks. ""It is a special place here for Australian players and I'm incredibly proud of what I've been able to achieve."" Barty will climb to second in the world when the latest standings are released next week, making her the highest-ranked Australian woman since Evonne Goolagong Cawley in December 1976. Despite defeat, 38th-ranked Vondrousova will rise into the top 20 for the first time following a clay-court swing where no other female player has won more matches. Re-live Barty's victory over Vondrousova Live scores, schedule and results Alerts: Get tennis news sent to your phone Barty's first Grand Slam singles title comes almost three years to the day since she reappeared in the WTA rankings - at 623rd - after taking more than a year out to switch sports. The Queenslander retired in 2014 and played for the Brisbane Heat in the women's Big Bash after saying tennis was a ""lonely sport"". She decided to return in early 2016 and has since won four tour titles - including the Miami Open in March - as well as the US Open women's doubles title last year. Those achievements were important steps on a sharp climb leading to this stunning success in Paris. Barty had the greater experience of the two finalists and it showed in a confident performance which did not allow Vondrousova to play with the variety she had previously shown. Vondrousova, like she did against British number one Johanna Konta in the semi-finals, started nervously - but this time there was no chance of a recovery. Barty's aggressive approach paid off as she took three of nine break points to clinch the opening set in just 29 minutes, the first which Vondrousova had dropped in the tournament. Barty broke again in the first game of the second set, then staved off a break point to hold a lengthy service game and maintain her advantage. She continued to read her teenage opponent's game throughout the second set, her neat footwork - on what used to be considered her weakest surface - enabling her to answer any question offered by Vondrousova. That was illustrated in what proved to be the final game, Barty's relentless returning allowing her to hit four winners as she turned a 15-40 deficit into a match-winning break. Barty is the first Australian woman to win a Grand Slam singles title since Sam Stosur at the US Open in 2011 While a French Open final contested by Barty and Vondrousova might have seemed unlikely at the outset of the tournament, it was further proof there is no shortage of talented young women ready to win the biggest titles. Barty is the ninth different female champion in the last 10 Grand Slams. With a combined age of 42, they were the youngest pair of female Grand Slam finalists since the 2008 French Open when 20-year-old Ana Ivanovic beat 22-year-old Dinara Safina. And whoever triumphed in Paris meant five of the WTA Tour's seven biggest tournaments so far in 2019 have been won by players aged 23 or under. Going into the final, the average age of all tournament champions this year was 23.6 years - the youngest since the 2008 season. The triumph for Barty, who turned 23 in April, means that figure will stay about the same.

"Alec Clark became head of education in Powys after the more senior post of director was scrapped Powys's head of education has resigned from his post just nine months after being appointed following a cut in senior management roles at the council. Alec Clark took over running education after the post of director of education was scrapped, in favour of a new role of director overseeing both education and social services. The council cut eight of 24 leadership posts last year to save Â£1.3m. The previous director left the council after failing to get the top job. Ian Budd had been Dr Clark's boss when the two of them went for the new head of education role after the post of director was deleted. Dr Clark is to take a new job as director of an education trust in southern England. Council defends top management shake-up Crisis meeting over school's failings The leader of the Liberal Democrat and Green group, James Gibson-Watt, called for a crisis meeting of all group leaders with chief executive Caroline Turner to discuss the future of the schools' service. He said there were a number of schools falling into serious budget deficit positions, especially at secondary level, and a ""general deterioration"" in the financial position of schools across the county. ""The council needs to establish a cross-party approach to create a coherent strategic vision for the Powys education system that can command support across the council,"" he said. Dr Turner confirmed Dr Clark would be leaving at the end of August, adding: ""I will want to discuss future arrangements with the appointments panel as soon as possible.

"Servers for data storage (file photo) Giant technology companies might cause significant disruption to the world's financial system, the head of the International Monetary Fund has warned. Christine Lagarde said just a few firms with big data access and artificial intelligence could run the global payment and settlement arrangements. Her warning came as the G20 finance ministers met in Japan. The summit is also discussing the need to close tax loopholes for internet giants like Facebook and Google. One of the options being considered is to tax such companies where they make their profits - rather than where they base their headquarters. The rise of the global mega-firms - why the IMF is worried Will AI kill developing world growth? ""A significant disruption to the financial landscape is likely to come from the big tech firms,"" Ms Lagarde said in Japan's south-western city of Fukuoka. She said such firms ""will use their enormous customer bases and deep pockets to offer financial products based on big data and artificial intelligence"". Christine Lagarde has been the IMF managing director since 2011 ""This presents a unique systemic challenge to financial stability and efficiency,"" she added. She cited China as a most recent example. ""Over the last five years, technology growth in China has been extremely successful and allowed millions of new entrants to benefit from access to financial products and the creation of high-quality jobs,"" Ms Lagarde said. ""But it has also led to two firms controlling more than 90% of the mobile payments market."" The rise of the global mega-firms - why the IMF is worried Will AI kill developing world growth?

"This video can not be played A look at the steps Mexico is taking to deal with migrants Mexico has agreed to take ""unprecedented steps"" to help stem the flow of migrants to the US in order to avoid trade tariffs threatened by President Donald Trump. Mr Trump revealed that a deal had been reached to suspend the tariffs ""indefinitely"" in a series of tweets. He had threatened to implement import duties of 5%, rising every month, unless Mexico acted to curb migration. The tariffs were due to come into effect on Monday. Is there a crisis on the US-Mexico border? Trump's border wall - in seven charts The deal, also confirmed in a tweet by Mexico's Foreign Secretary Marcelo Ebrard, comes at the end of three days of negotiations, which saw Washington demand a crackdown on Central American migrants.

Mr Trump caught members of his own party unaware when he announced the proposed tariffs last week. He had declared an emergency on the US-Mexico border in February, saying it was necessary in order to tackle what he claimed was a crisis with thousands of undocumented migrants crossing the frontier. In a joint declaration released by the US state department, the two countries said Mexico would take ""unprecedented"" steps to curb irregular migration and human trafficking. But it seems the US did not get one of its reported key demands that would have required Mexico to take in asylum seekers heading for the US and process their claims on its own soil. Under the deal, Mexico agreed to: Deploy its National Guard throughout the country from Monday, pledging up to 6,000 additional troops along Mexico's southern border with Guatemala Take ""decisive action"" in tackling human smuggling networks The US also agreed to: Expand its programme of sending asylum seekers back to Mexico while they awaited reviews of their claims. In return, the US would ""work to accelerate"" the adjudication process Both countries pledged to ""strengthen bilateral co-operation"" over border security, including ""co-ordinated actions"" and information sharing. This video can not be played Five numbers that explain why the current US border crisis is different The declaration added that discussions would continue, and final terms be accepted and announced within 90 days. Should Mexico's actions ""not have the expected results"", the agreement warned that additional measures could be taken, but did not specify what these would be. Mr Ebrard told journalists: ""I think it was a fair balance, because they have more drastic measures and proposals at the start, and we have reached some middle point."" Thousands are fleeing poverty and violent crime in Central America, hoping for a new life in the US ""We couldn't be more pleased with the agreement,"" US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told reporters at a separate news conference. Mexico is currently one of the largest trading partners of the US, just behind China and Canada - two countries also locked in trade disputes with the US. By Will Grant, BBC Mexico and Central America correspondent It's still unclear whether it was internal pressure within his party or the measures being offered by Mexico that dissuaded Mr Trump from implementing the plan. Or perhaps simply an appreciation of its potential consequences. It became apparent during the talks just how intertwined the two neighbouring economies are, and many argued that a 5% tax on all Mexican goods would hurt US suppliers and customers too. Furthermore, damaging the already fragile Mexican economy could have pushed it into a full recession and created more migrants heading north in search of work. Still, some considered the bilateral meetings were useful, in part to recognise that both nations are facing a steep rise in undocumented immigration. The plan to deploy military personnel to Mexico's southern border may well have helped bring this dispute to an end. However, President Trump has now tied immigration to bilateral trade and could easily do so again in the future should the situation fail to improve. President AndrÃ©s Manuel LÃ³pez Obrador ran for office vowing to stand up to the US and once said he would not allow Mexico to be Mr Trump's ""whipping boy"". But some politicians felt he had given too much, too quickly, and they demanded to see details of the deal. Ãngel Ãvila Romero, a senior member of the left-wing PRD party, said the agreement was ""not a negotiation, it was a surrender"". This video can not be played Why are Africans in Mexico heading to US? ""Mexico should not militarise its southern border. We are not the backyard of Donald Trump,"" he tweeted. Marko CortÃ©s, leader of the conservative National Action Party (PAN), said the sovereignty and dignity of Mexico had been damaged, newspaper El Universal reported. Who is President LÃ³pez Obrador? At a rally on Saturday in the border city of Tijuana, Mr LÃ³pez Obrador hailed the new deal, but warned that it would not be enough for Mexico to tighten its borders alone. The leftist leader said the US also needed to invest in the economic development of Central America to help combat ""the lack of opportunity and poverty so that migration is optional"". On Wednesday, US Customs and Border Protection announced that migrant detentions had surged in May to the highest level in more than a decade. Border Patrol apprehended 132,887 migrants attempting to enter the US from Mexico in May - a 33% increase from the month before. The arrests were the highest monthly total since Mr Trump took office. ""We are in a full-blown emergency, and I cannot say this stronger, the system is broken,"" said acting CBP Commissioner John Sanders. Official figures show illegal border crossings have been in decline since 2000. In 2000, 1.6 million people were apprehended trying to cross the border illegally - that number was just under 400,000 in 2018. In 2017, Mr Trump's first year in office, the figures were the lowest they had been since 1971. In the past two years, however, the number of arrests has been rising again, especially in recent months. Is there a crisis on the border?

"Linda Fairstein observed the interrogation of the Central Park Five Linda Fairstein, a former US prosecutor turned crime novelist, has been dropped by her publisher amid renewed outcry over her role in the wrongful conviction of five teenagers for the brutal rape of a female jogger in 1989. The black and Hispanic teenagers, known as the Central Park Five, were exonerated in 2002. New Netflix mini-series When They See Us has returned attention to the case. It has inspired a #CancelLindaFairstein movement on social media. This video can not be played Central Park Five: 'They put bounty on our heads' Also on Friday, Yusef Salaam, one of the five wrongfully convicted men, accused President Donald Trump of putting ""a bounty on our heads"" by amplifying public outrage at the time. Mr Salaam was referring to the decision by the then real estate tycoon, to buy full-page ads in several US newspapers calling for the return of the death penalty in the state. ""They had published our names, our phone numbers, and our addresses in New York City's newspapers. Imagine the horror of that,"" a tearful Mr Salaam said at an American Civil Liberties Union event in Los Angeles. Trump and his Central Park Five defiance President Trump - who three years ago said he still believed the five men were guilty - has not commented on the latest developments. Dutton, a Penguin Random House imprint, said it had ended its relationship with the author amid the backlash. ""I can confirm that Linda Fairstein and Dutton have decided to terminate their relationship. We have no further comment,"" Dutton Publicity Director Amanda Walker told the BBC. Ms Fairstein, 72, has reportedly also resigned from at least two not-for-profit boards. The crime novelist, who has written 20 novels since the 1990s, has not commented on the issue. Ms Fairstein was the top Manhattan sexual crimes prosecutor when the five teenagers were charged with the attack. The victim, a white 28-year-old investment banker, was severely beaten, raped and left for dead in a bush. She had no memory of the attack. Raymond Santana, Kevin Richardson, Antron McCray, Yusef Salaam and Korey Wise - then aged between 14 and 16 - were arrested and interrogated for hours without access to lawyers or their parents. The incident in New York City's Central Park (pictured above) provoked racial tension and fears that black teenagers were going on crime rampages. They confessed to the crime but later recanted, saying their admissions were the result of police coercion. Ms Fairstein observed the teenagers' 1989 interrogation, which was conducted by another prosecutor and police. She has since maintained that they were not coerced and defended the authorities' conduct. The convictions were overturned in 2002 after a serial violent offender named Matias Reyes confessed to the attack and said he had acted alone. Reyes confessed from inside prison, after having ""found religion"". He is serving a life sentence for raping four women, killing one of them. ""I was a monster,"" he said in an interview with US network ABC. ""I did some real bad things to so many people and harmed them in so many ways."" The racially charged case shocked the city and provoked fears of gangs of black teenagers going on crime rampages.

"Servers for data storage (file photo) Giant technology companies might cause significant disruption to the world's financial system, the head of the International Monetary Fund has warned. Christine Lagarde said just a few firms with big data access and artificial intelligence could run the global payment and settlement arrangements. Her warning came as the G20 finance ministers met in Japan. The summit is also discussing the need to close tax loopholes for internet giants like Facebook and Google. One of the options being considered is to tax such companies where they make their profits - rather than where they base their headquarters. The rise of the global mega-firms - why the IMF is worried Will AI kill developing world growth? ""A significant disruption to the financial landscape is likely to come from the big tech firms,"" Ms Lagarde said in Japan's south-western city of Fukuoka. She said such firms ""will use their enormous customer bases and deep pockets to offer financial products based on big data and artificial intelligence"". Christine Lagarde has been the IMF managing director since 2011 ""This presents a unique systemic challenge to financial stability and efficiency,"" she added. She cited China as a most recent example. ""Over the last five years, technology growth in China has been extremely successful and allowed millions of new entrants to benefit from access to financial products and the creation of high-quality jobs,"" Ms Lagarde said. ""But it has also led to two firms controlling more than 90% of the mobile payments market."" The rise of the global mega-firms - why the IMF is worried Will AI kill developing world growth?

"Alec Clark became head of education in Powys after the more senior post of director was scrapped Powys's head of education has resigned from his post just nine months after being appointed following a cut in senior management roles at the council. Alec Clark took over running education after the post of director of education was scrapped, in favour of a new role of director overseeing both education and social services. The council cut eight of 24 leadership posts last year to save Â£1.3m. The previous director left the council after failing to get the top job. Ian Budd had been Dr Clark's boss when the two of them went for the new head of education role after the post of director was deleted. Dr Clark is to take a new job as director of an education trust in southern England. Council defends top management shake-up Crisis meeting over school's failings The leader of the Liberal Democrat and Green group, James Gibson-Watt, called for a crisis meeting of all group leaders with chief executive Caroline Turner to discuss the future of the schools' service. He said there were a number of schools falling into serious budget deficit positions, especially at secondary level, and a ""general deterioration"" in the financial position of schools across the county. ""The council needs to establish a cross-party approach to create a coherent strategic vision for the Powys education system that can command support across the council,"" he said. Dr Turner confirmed Dr Clark would be leaving at the end of August, adding: ""I will want to discuss future arrangements with the appointments panel as soon as possible.

They have thrashed Bangladesh by 106 runs to return to winning ways. Read ourmatch report for full details and highlightswhile if you want more cricket you can alsofollow New Zealand v Afghanistan. That one is getting a little tense. Scroll down for highlights and reaction from England's win! This video can not be played Cricket World Cup: Jason Roy roars England to victory Mark Wood also took two wickets and Adil Rashid one... While Ben Stokes bowled excellently at the lower order for three wickets after dismissing Shakib... Bangladesh's best partnership was again between Mushfiqur Rahim and Shakib. Liam Plunkett dismissed Mushfiqur to break it... After a brilliant batting display, England were also excellent with the ball. Jofra Archer was intimidating up top. He bowled Souyma Sarkar with a stunning delivery - the first wicket of the innings... He then nipped in with two at the end to close out the match... England skipper Eoin Morgan:""We knew we had to improve with the bat, we were outstanding and Jason got a good score. He's very intimidating to play against so the impact that has on our team is very significant. The majority of people will open with spin but there are always things to throw against us. Hopefully we can counter all the plans thrown at us. The bowlers were all outstanding, they are wonderful to captain."" On Jos Buttler's injury:""No serious concern with Jos at the moment. He didn't keep wicket as a precaution after he felt his hip, but it will be monitored over the next 48 hours."" Bangladesh centurion Shakib Al Hasan:""Very happy with the way I played but we didn't start well with the ball and when they got the start they capitalised and we had to play the catch up game. Credit goes to the England batsmen. We need to pick ourselves up because there are plenty of games left."" This video can not be played Shakib's cut past third man gets him four more runs Bangladesh captain Mashrafe Mortaza:""387 is too many to be asking from the batsmen. In the first four or five overs we had control but after England took over. We knew we had to get Roy out and then we could have got back into the match. Asked if he would change his decision to bowl first if given the chance:""I think so. The pitch had been one and a half days under cover so the straightforward decision should have been to field. Sometimes you need a bit of luck to get those early wickets. 320 or 330 could have been a different chase. On centurion Shakib Al Hasan:""From the first match he has been playing so well for us. His bowling also has been fantastic. He is performing so well at the moment. There is a long way to go, hopefully the other players will step up. The next two or three matches will be very important for us."" Michael VaughanEx-England captain on TMS Buttler is a terrific player to have, you can't set fields to him and these boundaries are just not big enough for him. The World Cup is back on track. Here's the final wicket for the match, taken by Jofra Archer. It was another vicious bouncer and sealed England's win. Liam Plunkett:""Another great partnership up top, it's always nice to get runs on the board. We took our time and got ourselves in and got a monster score. It's obviously nice to get in at number eight and strike a few balls. It's nice to keep to our standards with the ball, it was a bit swirly but I bowled my eight overs into the wind and it was a good performance."" We'll continue to bring you reaction from this game.Follow New Zealand v Afghanistan here. Eoin Morgan says there is no serious concern over Jos Buttler. Jos Buttler again entertained today. He and Eoin Morgan contributed in the middle order with good knocks which helped propel England to their highest total in a World Cup. Buttler scored 64 from 44 balls with trademark big shots... The only worry was the injury he seemed to pick up when hitting this six. He did not take to the field in the second innings. Michael VaughanEx-England captain on TMS If England can clear out the peripheral nonsense - against Pakistan they were agitated - it's about the mentality going forward. Was Jason Roy distracted by hitting six sixes in an over when he got out? He hit three in a row before skying one up for a simple catch... Man of the match Jason Roy:""It was great to right those wrongs from the last game. Jonny and myself didn't quite know what the pitch was going to behave like so we knew with our line-up batting the whole 50 we were going to get enough. We've put in a well rounded performance so I'm extremely happy with the boys."" Jason Roy and Jonny Bairstow had to battle early. They were very smart. After a cautious start they then put on another hundred partnership. Bairstow fell but Roy went on to smash 153 from 121 balls. Here are some of the highlights... Jonathan AgnewBBC cricket correspondent Well played to everyone down here for getting this ground fit - there was torrential rain down here last night, there were lakes in the car park.

Malcolm Mide-Madariola was standing up for a friend when he wasstabbed to death near Clapham South Tube stationin south-west London on 2 November. Olumide Wole-Madariola said he would be willing to meet the boy convicted of murdering his son if given the chance. Since Malcolm's death, his family has launched a charity for vulnerable youngsters.

""When they come out they're going to be in their adulthood so I would be wiling to speak with them and hope they use the best part of their years to be a better part of society,"" Mr Wole-Madariola said.

""When you have kids that are not engrossed in anything they tend to wander away,"" he said. ""Regardless of where they're coming from, if their parents are divorced, criminal, or been to jail, they should know that their own personal future matters."" Malcolm's father said his son ""shared with people that didn't have as much"", and his outlook has inspired the charity's mission. The foundation plans to rent space to put on lectures and vocational courses, before eventually finding a permanent home in Clapham.

"This video can not be played Police moved in and made arrests as protesters gathered outside the court A Russian investigative journalist, Ivan Golunov, has been arrested in the capital Moscow and charged with trying to illegally sell drugs. He was placed under house arrest after a court hearing. Earlier, he was given a medical examination amid reports he had been injured during the arrest. The reporter for Latvia-based news site Meduza was detained on Thursday. His lawyer says drugs were planted on him, an accusation the Russian authorities deny. Meduza says Mr Golunov, 36, is being ""being persecuted because of his journalistic activity"". The court rejected a request by investigators to keep him in custody. He reporter had been on his way to meet another journalist on Thursday when he was stopped and searched by officers. They say they found the synthetic drug mephedrone in his rucksack, and that a later search of his flat turned up more drugs and some scales - indicating that he was involved in dealing. Investigative journalist Ivan Golunov was arrested on Thursday The journalist was officially charged on Saturday morning with attempting illegally to produce, sell or pass on drugs. Police released photos which they said showed drug paraphernalia in Mr Golunov's flat, but these were later withdrawn, BBC Russian journalist Olga Ivshina reports. Russia laws ban 'disrespect' of government and 'fake news' Russia to make its own show about Chernobyl The police, she adds, admitted that ""most of the published photos had not been taken at Mr Golunov's flat after all, but were related to another criminal investigation that might be linked to his detention"". Meduza said in a statement that Mr Golunov had received threats in recent months over a story he was working on. ""We are convinced that Ivan Golunov is innocent,"" the statement reads, according to Reuters news agency. ""Moreover, we have grounds to believe that Golunov is being persecuted because of his journalistic activity."" by Nataliya Zotova, BBC Russian reporter Ivan Golunov's friends and journalists have been waiting outside the court building since the morning, showing their support for a colleague they believe has been wrongly arrested. ""I don't believe we can change anything standing there. But what else can we do?"" Evgeny Buntman of Ekho Moskvy, one of few independent radio stations in Russia, wondered aloud. ""People come here not because they can be of help here, but because of a deep feeling of helplessness."" In the courtroom, Golunov cried when he saw his friends and colleagues. Everyone was expecting him to be jailed while he awaited trial. Instead, the judge decided on house arrest. The angry screams of the crowd outside instantly transformed into yelps of joy which carried through the open windows into the courtroom. Now, it was Golunov's friends to cry - out of relief. A medical examination at Moscow's Hospital Number 71 showed that he had an abrasion on his back and bruising around one eye but no serious injuries that required a stay in hospital, Dr Alexander Myasnikov told Russian media. None of his ribs were broken, he added, after earlier claims that he had suffered a fracture. Meduza says he was beaten up by officers both during his arrest and later at a police station. He was, the news site says, only able to contact a friend after 14 hours. In the first video of Mr Golunov since his arrest, posted by the Russian news site Breaking Mash, he lifts up his shirt to reveal marks on his back. Allow Twitter content?

Mr Golunov said he had been involved in ""scuffles"" with police, and showed bruises. His lawyer, Dmitry Julay, told reporters that the journalist had been denied food and sleep for more than 24 hours. The journalist has repeatedly exposed corruption among Moscow's high-profile businesspeople and its political elite, as well as fraudulent financial schemes in the city. Journalists in Russia have often been harassed or attacked in recent years for their work. Many opposition figures and human rights activists in Russia have been detained on apparently fabricated drugs charges, which are widely seen as an attempt to quash political dissent. Much of Russia's media is controlled by the state andRussia is ranked 83rd out of 100 countries for press freedom by Freedom House,external. Mr Golunov's mother Svetlana (centre) with Galina Timchenko ""We will find out by whose will Vanya [Ivan] is being pursued, and we will make this information public,"" Meduza's director Galina Timchenko and editor Ivan Kolpakov said. ""We will protect our journalist by all available means."" The journalist's arrest sparked protests in Moscow and St Petersburg, andmore than a dozen people - mostly fellow journalists - were reportedly detained,externaland later released. On Saturday, police detained several people trying to protest about the arrest outside Nikulinsky Court, with one placard condemning the case against the reporter as a ""fabrication"". Mr Golunov's mother, Svetlana Golunova, told Reuters the arrest was ""not even a farce, it is something unbelievable"", and she expected ""only victory"".

"Linda Fairstein observed the interrogation of the Central Park Five Linda Fairstein, a former US prosecutor turned crime novelist, has been dropped by her publisher amid renewed outcry over her role in the wrongful conviction of five teenagers for the brutal rape of a female jogger in 1989. The black and Hispanic teenagers, known as the Central Park Five, were exonerated in 2002. New Netflix mini-series When They See Us has returned attention to the case. It has inspired a #CancelLindaFairstein movement on social media. This video can not be played Central Park Five: 'They put bounty on our heads' Also on Friday, Yusef Salaam, one of the five wrongfully convicted men, accused President Donald Trump of putting ""a bounty on our heads"" by amplifying public outrage at the time. Mr Salaam was referring to the decision by the then real estate tycoon, to buy full-page ads in several US newspapers calling for the return of the death penalty in the state. ""They had published our names, our phone numbers, and our addresses in New York City's newspapers. Imagine the horror of that,"" a tearful Mr Salaam said at an American Civil Liberties Union event in Los Angeles. Trump and his Central Park Five defiance President Trump - who three years ago said he still believed the five men were guilty - has not commented on the latest developments. Dutton, a Penguin Random House imprint, said it had ended its relationship with the author amid the backlash. ""I can confirm that Linda Fairstein and Dutton have decided to terminate their relationship. We have no further comment,"" Dutton Publicity Director Amanda Walker told the BBC. Ms Fairstein, 72, has reportedly also resigned from at least two not-for-profit boards. The crime novelist, who has written 20 novels since the 1990s, has not commented on the issue. Ms Fairstein was the top Manhattan sexual crimes prosecutor when the five teenagers were charged with the attack. The victim, a white 28-year-old investment banker, was severely beaten, raped and left for dead in a bush. She had no memory of the attack. Raymond Santana, Kevin Richardson, Antron McCray, Yusef Salaam and Korey Wise - then aged between 14 and 16 - were arrested and interrogated for hours without access to lawyers or their parents. The incident in New York City's Central Park (pictured above) provoked racial tension and fears that black teenagers were going on crime rampages. They confessed to the crime but later recanted, saying their admissions were the result of police coercion. Ms Fairstein observed the teenagers' 1989 interrogation, which was conducted by another prosecutor and police. She has since maintained that they were not coerced and defended the authorities' conduct. The convictions were overturned in 2002 after a serial violent offender named Matias Reyes confessed to the attack and said he had acted alone. Reyes confessed from inside prison, after having ""found religion"". He is serving a life sentence for raping four women, killing one of them. ""I was a monster,"" he said in an interview with US network ABC. ""I did some real bad things to so many people and harmed them in so many ways."" The racially charged case shocked the city and provoked fears of gangs of black teenagers going on crime rampages. A US judge in 2014 approved a $41m (Â£32m) settlementbetween the five and New York City.

"This video can not be played PC Dave Wardell: ""I wouldn't be here today if it wasn't for Finn"" A new law named after a police dog which recently appeared on Britain's Got Talent has come into effect. German shepherd Finn was stabbed and seriously hurt as he protected PC Dave Wardell from an attacker in 2016. Nicknamed ""Finn's Law"", the new legislation makes it harder for those who harm service animals to claim they were acting in self-defence. PC Wardell, who has led calls for the change in the law, said the pair's journey had been ""incredible"". Appearing on ITV's Britain's Got Talent, PC Wardell described Finn as a ""lovely, lovely lad"" The father-of-three and Finn reached the final of ITV's primetime variety show with a magic act that moved the judges to tears. ""This law is the only reason I put myself on stage in front of nine million people,"" said PC Wardell, who is still a serving officer. He began campaigning for the newAnimal Welfare (Service Animals) Act,externalafter Finn - now retired - saved his life when a knife-wielding robbery suspect attacked them in Stevenage in 2016. Finn was stabbed in the chest and headand was not expected to survive. PC Wardell was stabbed in the hand. Police dog Finn received the PDSA Gold Medal in March for police service A 16-year-old boy from Londonwas found guilty of causing PC Wardell actual bodily harm. Under the previous law, the attack on Finn could only be treated as criminal damage. PC Wardell said this has made it difficult for the judge to ""put a value on property"" when deciding on a sentence. ""Service animals until now have fallen through legal loopholes,"" he said. The new law was an attempt to ""take the model of Australia and Canada"" and ""right that wrong"", he said. PC Wardell said he would now push for increased sentences on all animal welfare cases, and a consultation is currently under way to amend the Animal Welfare Act in Scotland. German shepherd Finn was stabbed in the head and chest after pursuing a suspect in 2016 ""Finn is an incredible dog and an amazing character,"" he said. ""He could be in a primary school for book readings one minute - and breaking up a pub fight the next. ""I'm immensely proud of him.""

"Killing Eve season two picks up where season one ended, which is to sayâ¦ badly. After seven faultless episodes, the grand finale of the best TV series of 2018 was almost as underwhelming as Eve Polastri's marriage. All the delicious ingredients of the previous shows were still there (excellent acting, writing, soundtrack, and directing), but someone tweaked the recipe and served up a bit of dog's dinner with a distinctly hammy whiff. The smell lingers well into the opening episode of the new series, which is a little too knowing and, on occasion, close to becoming a pastiche of itself. Villanelle (Jodie Comer) is too predictable, Eve (Sandra Oh) is too wrung out, and Niko her husband, too needy. Thankfully, Fiona Shaw shows the way with understated class and intelligence, as Eve's boss Carolyn. Fiona Shaw as the ruthless spy chief, Carolyn Martens, who has a tricky relationship with Eve The action begins 30 seconds after the last season finished. M16 agent Eve is standing on the staircase of assassin Villanelle's Parisian apartment. She is holding the bloody knife with which she stabbed the ruthless Russian psycho-killer, who has played her party trick and disappeared into thin air. Sandra Oh says agent Eve Polastri goes to ""a psychologically dark place"" in the second series Filming the scene where assassin Villanelle (Jodie Comer) tries to hail a taxi, moments after being stabbed There's a lot of hyperventilating and many a furrowed brow. That's on screen, and maybe off it as well in the writers' room. The daunting task facing Emerald Fennell and her scriptwriting collaborators was how to pick up where Phoebe Waller-Bridge left off and somehow re-juice a dried up drama. The mutual obsession between Eve and Villanelle, which is the key dramatic device driving the story, had climaxed at the end of season one in a disappointingly limp stand-off followed by a dull heart-to-heart and a half-baked fight. It put the show into intensive care, which is where Villanelle soon fetches up while Eve heads back to London to try to fix her marriage and find a new job. Villanelle, still in her pyjamas, leaves hospital sooner than she should after being treated for her injuries The quality of the acting, our investment in the characters, and some quickly laid new plotlines are enough to entice you to watch the second 40-minute episode. At which point Killing Eve returns gloriously to form, with a funny, clever script that starts to rebuild the sexual tension between agent and assassin. The two remain infatuated with each other but now there is some added spice. Villanelle has competition for Eve's attentions and it ain't coming from Niko. That's the hook, not the mysterious baddies The Twelve, who any one of the protagonists could belong to for all we know - or care. Needless to say, Villanelle still murders people with the regularity and sensitivity of an automated phone call asking if you've been in a car crash, but the killings are a side show. Owen McDonnell is back as Eve's long-suffering husband, Niko Sean Delaney plays Kenny Stowton, who is a loyal part of Eve's team, and Carolyn's son The real drama is in the relationships between the players: Carolyn and her son Kenny (Sean Delaney). Eve and Niko. Villanelle and her handlers. And, of course, between Eve and Villanelle. Will they get it together? Will one kill the other? Can a cold-blooded murderer become a vulnerable, compassionate human being? In other words, the same issues that kept us on tenterhooks in season one. It fell short. Will season two be better and succeed in delivering its punchline? You can find out later on Saturday when the entire series drops on the BBC iPlayer. I've seen the first four and my hopes are high. Killing Eve is top quality television. And not just from a British standpoint, it ranks with the very best shows coming out of Hollywood. It's no surprise the head of Netflix has cited it as the one title he truly covets. That it is superbly made is a given in these golden days of box office box sets. But that's not what makes it stand out; it is not the reason that Killing Eve will sit alongside Friends and Breaking Bad as an all-time TV classic. It is the balance it strikes between bone-dry humour reminiscent of the best of early James Bond, and an exploration of identity, sexuality, and isolation in the second decade of the 21st Century. Fiona Shaw, Phoebe Waller-Bridge and Jodie Comer all won Baftas for Killing Eve For this, much of the credit must go to Luke Jennings, the Observer's dance critic. For Villanelle is his creation. He originally self-published the story as a series of online novellas before it was picked up by a canny TV producer. Once it had been commissioned for telly Jennings had his work cut out to do his day job while collaborating with Waller-Bridge on the television scripts, ""I felt like Stalin, planning murder all day and watching Swan Lake in the evening,"" he wrote in the Observer last year. His background in ballet provides an interesting insight into his creation. The juxtaposition between beauty and the beast is what makes Killing Eve so compelling. As does the not-always merry dance he takes us on. You could argue that Jennings has written the most brilliant, exquisitely choreographed, blood-soaked pas de deux.

At which point Killing Eve returns gloriously to form, with a funny, clever script that starts to rebuild the sexual tension between agent and assassin. The two remain infatuated with each other but now there is some added spice. Villanelle has competition for Eve's attentions and it ain't coming from Niko. That's the hook, not the mysterious baddies The Twelve, who any one of the protagonists could belong to for all we know - or care. Needless to say, Villanelle still murders people with the regularity and sensitivity of an automated phone call asking if you've been in a car crash, but the killings are a side show. Owen McDonnell is back as Eve's long-suffering husband, Niko Sean Delaney plays Kenny Stowton, who is a loyal part of Eve's team, and Carolyn's son The real drama is in the relationships between the players: Carolyn and her son Kenny (Sean Delaney). Eve and Niko. Villanelle and her handlers. And, of course, between Eve and Villanelle. Will they get it together? Will one kill the other? Can a cold-blooded murderer become a vulnerable, compassionate human being? In other words, the same issues that kept us on tenterhooks in season one. It fell short. Will season two be better and succeed in delivering its punchline? You can find out later on Saturday when the entire series drops on the BBC iPlayer. I've seen the first four and my hopes are high. Killing Eve is top quality television. And not just from a British standpoint, it ranks with the very best shows coming out of Hollywood. It's no surprise the head of Netflix has cited it as the one title he truly covets. That it is superbly made is a given in these golden days of box office box sets. But that's not what makes it stand out; it is not the reason that Killing Eve will sit alongside Friends and Breaking Bad as an all-time TV classic. It is the balance it strikes between bone-dry humour reminiscent of the best of early James Bond, and an exploration of identity, sexuality, and isolation in the second decade of the 21st Century. Fiona Shaw, Phoebe Waller-Bridge and Jodie Comer all won Baftas for Killing Eve For this, much of the credit must go to Luke Jennings, the Observer's dance critic. For Villanelle is his creation. He originally self-published the story as a series of online novellas before it was picked up by a canny TV producer. Once it had been commissioned for telly Jennings had his work cut out to do his day job while collaborating with Waller-Bridge on the television scripts, ""I felt like Stalin, planning murder all day and watching Swan Lake in the evening,"" he wrote in the Observer last year. His background in ballet provides an interesting insight into his creation. The juxtaposition between beauty and the beast is what makes Killing Eve so compelling. As does the not-always merry dance he takes us on. You could argue that Jennings has written the most brilliant, exquisitely choreographed, blood-soaked pas de deux.

"This video can not be played A look at the steps Mexico is taking to deal with migrants Mexico has agreed to take ""unprecedented steps"" to help stem the flow of migrants to the US in order to avoid trade tariffs threatened by President Donald Trump. Mr Trump revealed that a deal had been reached to suspend the tariffs ""indefinitely"" in a series of tweets. He had threatened to implement import duties of 5%, rising every month, unless Mexico acted to curb migration. The tariffs were due to come into effect on Monday. Is there a crisis on the US-Mexico border? Trump's border wall - in seven charts The deal, also confirmed in a tweet by Mexico's Foreign Secretary Marcelo Ebrard, comes at the end of three days of negotiations, which saw Washington demand a crackdown on Central American migrants.

Mr Trump caught members of his own party unaware when he announced the proposed tariffs last week. He had declared an emergency on the US-Mexico border in February, saying it was necessary in order to tackle what he claimed was a crisis with thousands of undocumented migrants crossing the frontier. In a joint declaration released by the US state department, the two countries said Mexico would take ""unprecedented"" steps to curb irregular migration and human trafficking. But it seems the US did not get one of its reported key demands that would have required Mexico to take in asylum seekers heading for the US and process their claims on its own soil. Under the deal, Mexico agreed to: Deploy its National Guard throughout the country from Monday, pledging up to 6,000 additional troops along Mexico's southern border with Guatemala Take ""decisive action"" in tackling human smuggling networks The US also agreed to: Expand its programme of sending asylum seekers back to Mexico while they awaited reviews of their claims. In return, the US would ""work to accelerate"" the adjudication process Both countries pledged to ""strengthen bilateral co-operation"" over border security, including ""co-ordinated actions"" and information sharing. This video can not be played Five numbers that explain why the current US border crisis is different The declaration added that discussions would continue, and final terms be accepted and announced within 90 days. Should Mexico's actions ""not have the expected results"", the agreement warned that additional measures could be taken, but did not specify what these would be. Mr Ebrard told journalists: ""I think it was a fair balance, because they have more drastic measures and proposals at the start, and we have reached some middle point."" Thousands are fleeing poverty and violent crime in Central America, hoping for a new life in the US ""We couldn't be more pleased with the agreement,"" US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told reporters at a separate news conference. Mexico is currently one of the largest trading partners of the US, just behind China and Canada - two countries also locked in trade disputes with the US. By Will Grant, BBC Mexico and Central America correspondent It's still unclear whether it was internal pressure within his party or the measures being offered by Mexico that dissuaded Mr Trump from implementing the plan. Or perhaps simply an appreciation of its potential consequences. It became apparent during the talks just how intertwined the two neighbouring economies are, and many argued that a 5% tax on all Mexican goods would hurt US suppliers and customers too. Furthermore, damaging the already fragile Mexican economy could have pushed it into a full recession and created more migrants heading north in search of work. Still, some considered the bilateral meetings were useful, in part to recognise that both nations are facing a steep rise in undocumented immigration. The plan to deploy military personnel to Mexico's southern border may well have helped bring this dispute to an end. However, President Trump has now tied immigration to bilateral trade and could easily do so again in the future should the situation fail to improve. President AndrÃ©s Manuel LÃ³pez Obrador ran for office vowing to stand up to the US and once said he would not allow Mexico to be Mr Trump's ""whipping boy"". But some politicians felt he had given too much, too quickly, and they demanded to see details of the deal. Ãngel Ãvila Romero, a senior member of the left-wing PRD party, said the agreement was ""not a negotiation, it was a surrender"". This video can not be played Why are Africans in Mexico heading to US? ""Mexico should not militarise its southern border. We are not the backyard of Donald Trump,"" he tweeted. Marko CortÃ©s, leader of the conservative National Action Party (PAN), said the sovereignty and dignity of Mexico had been damaged, newspaper El Universal reported. Who is President LÃ³pez Obrador? At a rally on Saturday in the border city of Tijuana, Mr LÃ³pez Obrador hailed the new deal, but warned that it would not be enough for Mexico to tighten its borders alone. The leftist leader said the US also needed to invest in the economic development of Central America to help combat ""the lack of opportunity and poverty so that migration is optional"". On Wednesday, US Customs and Border Protection announced that migrant detentions had surged in May to the highest level in more than a decade. Border Patrol apprehended 132,887 migrants attempting to enter the US from Mexico in May - a 33% increase from the month before. The arrests were the highest monthly total since Mr Trump took office. ""We are in a full-blown emergency, and I cannot say this stronger, the system is broken,"" said acting CBP Commissioner John Sanders. Official figures show illegal border crossings have been in decline since 2000. In 2000, 1.6 million people were apprehended trying to cross the border illegally - that number was just under 400,000 in 2018. In 2017, Mr Trump's first year in office, the figures were the lowest they had been since 1971. In the past two years, however, the number of arrests has been rising again, especially in recent months. Is there a crisis on the border?

He bowled Souyma Sarkar with a stunning delivery - the first wicket of the innings... He then nipped in with two at the end to close out the match... England skipper Eoin Morgan:""We knew we had to improve with the bat, we were outstanding and Jason got a good score. He's very intimidating to play against so the impact that has on our team is very significant. The majority of people will open with spin but there are always things to throw against us. Hopefully we can counter all the plans thrown at us. The bowlers were all outstanding, they are wonderful to captain."" On Jos Buttler's injury:""No serious concern with Jos at the moment. He didn't keep wicket as a precaution after he felt his hip, but it will be monitored over the next 48 hours."" Bangladesh centurion Shakib Al Hasan:""Very happy with the way I played but we didn't start well with the ball and when they got the start they capitalised and we had to play the catch up game.

Asked if he would change his decision to bowl first if given the chance:""I think so. The pitch had been one and a half days under cover so the straightforward decision should have been to field. Sometimes you need a bit of luck to get those early wickets. 320 or 330 could have been a different chase. On centurion Shakib Al Hasan:""From the first match he has been playing so well for us. His bowling also has been fantastic. He is performing so well at the moment. There is a long way to go, hopefully the other players will step up. The next two or three matches will be very important for us.""

Liam Plunkett:""Another great partnership up top, it's always nice to get runs on the board. We took our time and got ourselves in and got a monster score. It's obviously nice to get in at number eight and strike a few balls.

"Killing Eve season two picks up where season one ended, which is to sayâ¦ badly. After seven faultless episodes, the grand finale of the best TV series of 2018 was almost as underwhelming as Eve Polastri's marriage. All the delicious ingredients of the previous shows were still there (excellent acting, writing, soundtrack, and directing), but someone tweaked the recipe and served up a bit of dog's dinner with a distinctly hammy whiff. The smell lingers well into the opening episode of the new series, which is a little too knowing and, on occasion, close to becoming a pastiche of itself. Villanelle (Jodie Comer) is too predictable, Eve (Sandra Oh) is too wrung out, and Niko her husband, too needy. Thankfully, Fiona Shaw shows the way with understated class and intelligence, as Eve's boss Carolyn. Fiona Shaw as the ruthless spy chief, Carolyn Martens, who has a tricky relationship with Eve The action begins 30 seconds after the last season finished. M16 agent Eve is standing on the staircase of assassin Villanelle's Parisian apartment. She is holding the bloody knife with which she stabbed the ruthless Russian psycho-killer, who has played her party trick and disappeared into thin air. Sandra Oh says agent Eve Polastri goes to ""a psychologically dark place"" in the second series Filming the scene where assassin Villanelle (Jodie Comer) tries to hail a taxi, moments after being stabbed There's a lot of hyperventilating and many a furrowed brow. That's on screen, and maybe off it as well in the writers' room. The daunting task facing Emerald Fennell and her scriptwriting collaborators was how to pick up where Phoebe Waller-Bridge left off and somehow re-juice a dried up drama. The mutual obsession between Eve and Villanelle, which is the key dramatic device driving the story, had climaxed at the end of season one in a disappointingly limp stand-off followed by a dull heart-to-heart and a half-baked fight. It put the show into intensive care, which is where Villanelle soon fetches up while Eve heads back to London to try to fix her marriage and find a new job. Villanelle, still in her pyjamas, leaves hospital sooner than she should after being treated for her injuries The quality of the acting, our investment in the characters, and some quickly laid new plotlines are enough to entice you to watch the second 40-minute episode.

"Servers for data storage (file photo) Giant technology companies might cause significant disruption to the world's financial system, the head of the International Monetary Fund has warned. Christine Lagarde said just a few firms with big data access and artificial intelligence could run the global payment and settlement arrangements. Her warning came as the G20 finance ministers met in Japan. The summit is also discussing the need to close tax loopholes for internet giants like Facebook and Google. One of the options being considered is to tax such companies where they make their profits - rather than where they base their headquarters. The rise of the global mega-firms - why the IMF is worried Will AI kill developing world growth? ""A significant disruption to the financial landscape is likely to come from the big tech firms,"" Ms Lagarde said in Japan's south-western city of Fukuoka. She said such firms ""will use their enormous customer bases and deep pockets to offer financial products based on big data and artificial intelligence"". Christine Lagarde has been the IMF managing director since 2011 ""This presents a unique systemic challenge to financial stability and efficiency,"" she added. She cited China as a most recent example. ""Over the last five years, technology growth in China has been extremely successful and allowed millions of new entrants to benefit from access to financial products and the creation of high-quality jobs,"" Ms Lagarde said.
