"A witness near a petrol station tipped off police Police have shot dead the main suspect in last Thursday's Barcelona attack, Younes Abouyaaqoub. They believe he was the driver of a van which careered down the Las Ramblas avenue, killing 13 and injuring more than 100 others. He was killed some 25 miles (40km) west of Barcelona near a sewage treatment works following a tip off. Abouyaaqoub, wearing a fake explosive belt, is reported to have shouted  ""Allahu Akbar"" (""God is Greatest""). An extensive manhunt was already under way when police closed in on the Subirats area, close to Sant SadurnÃ­ d'Anoia. A petrol station employee spotted Abouyaaqoub and called the police who found him hiding in vineyards. After he was shot, bomb disposal officers used a robot to examine the fake explosive belt. This led to some delay before Moroccan-born Abouyaaqoub could be officially identified. Local residents described seeing some 20 police cars heading for the scene and helicopters circling. Police said the investigation was still international in scope. At an earlier news conference, police described Abouyaaqoub's escape from the scene of the Barcelona attack on foot to the outskirts of the city where he hijacked a car and stabbed its driver. CCTV footage in Spanish media appears to show him walking through a market district. The man murdered in the car was named as Pau PÃ©rez, 34, from Vilafranca - the 15th victim of the Barcelona bloodshed and a later attack in the resort of Cambrils. A woman died in Cambrils when a car was driven into pedestrians and five suspected jihadists were killed at the scene by police early on Friday. Spain attacks: What we know so far Who are the Barcelona suspects? In pictures: Barcelona van attack Swimmer sacrifices race for terror victims Police have also confirmed that an imam, suspected of radicalising the young men who carried out the attacks, died in what is believed to have been an accidental explosion on Wednesday at a house in Alcanar, south of Barcelona, that was being used as a bomb factory. The remains of one other person found at the house are still being examined. The terror cell behind the attacks was 12 strong. Police say eight suspects are now dead and four are in custody. The group had apparently been planning three co-ordinated attacks using home-made bombs, but were thwarted by the Alcanar blast. Police found about 120 gas canisters at the Alcanar site. Who were the victims? Barcelona attack: What the trees say Family members of the dead suspects said they believed Imam Es Satty had radicalised several young people in their home town of Ripoll, north of Barcelona. Spanish media outlets say he had spent some time in prison, and had met prisoners involved or linked with the 2004 Madrid train bombings in which 191 people died. He had also stayed in Belgium for some three months last year, where he had been searching for work, including in Vilvoorde, a small town of 42,000 people from which more than 20 jihadists departed for Syria in 2014. An official who works on de-radicalisation in Belgium has told the BBC that Es Satty tried to secure a post at a mosque near Brussels but the elders decided he should not be allowed to preach due to his ""radicalised and polarising"" approach. The mosque asked police to perform a background security check but this did not throw up any specific areas of concern.

"Ford is the latest car company to launch an incentive for UK consumers to trade in cars over seven years old, by offering Â£2,000 off some new models. Unlike schemes by BMW and Mercedes, which are only for diesels, Ford will also accept petrol cars. Ford said all of the part-exchanged vehicles will be scrapped, having an immediate effect on air quality. Campaigners said it was a step in the right direction but the government had to do more. Speaking on the BBC's Today programme, Andy Barratt, chairman and managing director of Ford of Britain, said its scrappage scheme ""is part of a journey"" to improve air quality. ""We have some pretty large incentives here, up to Â£7,000 if you have a commercial transit vehicle,"" he said. ""We're the only scheme open to commercials. It is part of a journey. ""Air quality is a much bigger debate and getting older vehicles off the road is part of that. ""New technology, such as plug-in hybrids etc, are all part of that longer journey we need to work together."" He denied it was simply a ploy to sell more cars. Consumers will be given Â£2,000 off new Ford models ranging in price from about Â£12,000 to more than Â£20,000. Ford said that by combining the scrappage incentive with other standard offers, customers could receive up to Â£4,000 off a car or Â£7,000 off the cost of a van. Under Ford's scheme old cars, from any manufacturer, can be exchanged until the end of December. New diesel and petrol vehicles to be banned from 2040 Q&A: How will the petrol and diesel car ban work? Mayor of London launches Â£42m fund to retire 'dirty' cabs The cars that can be traded in include any built to emissions standards that applied before 2010. Vauxhall ran a similar scrappage scheme earlier this year, as well as in 2015 and 2016. James Baggott, editor-in-chief of Car Dealer magazine, speaking on ""Wake Up to Money"" on BBC Radio 5 Live, said the scheme was good for Ford, for consumers and the environment because it meant the worst polluting cars were being removed from roads. ""It means people can swap one of these old, dirty diesels, which is going to be worth less than the Â£2,000 that they (Ford) are giving them in part exchange for it. ""They can buy a new Fiesta for I think around Â£10,700. That's actually a good deal,"" he added. Mr Baggott said new diesel engines were ""extremely clean"" compared with their older counterparts, so even just upgrading a diesel vehicle would help towards better air quality. But he said this was a transitional phase: ""We need to look to the future, to electric cars, hybrid cars, fuel cell cars. They are what we need to be looking towards. ""I would like to see schemes like this incentivising customers to buy cleaner electric vehicles."" Peter Campbell, motor industry correspondent for the Financial Times, said greener options were still limited. ""Almost no-one on the market right now has an affordable electric car that can drive a decent range using its batteries before needing recharging. ""These cars are coming and will come in the next five years and all the carmakers have to meet these emission targets that are coming into force in 2021. ""What many people will do is use this to buy smaller cars, and to be fair to Ford, the new cars they're selling - the new diesels, the new petrol - are orders of magnitude cleaner than the ones bought in 2009."" The government's clean air strategy announced in July did not include a scrappage scheme, although it proposed a consultation on it later in the year. Instead, it said new diesel and petrol cars would be banned from 2040. It made the announcement after losing a case against environmental law campaigners Client Earth over breaches in EU emissions standards. Client Earth lawyer Anna Heslop welcomed Ford's scheme but said it could not make up for lack of action by the government. ""It seems the motor industry is finally waking up to the damage dirty diesels are doing to our lungs as well as their own reputation. ""What we need is a thought-through, coherent strategy from government to help people to move to cleaner and more sustainable technology. ""At the moment, there are pockets of small, short-term actions here and there, but nothing like the joined-up thinking we need to solve this problem,"" she added. Steve Gooding, director of the RAC Foundation, agreed there needed to be an overall strategy. ""The problem with a scrappage scheme aimed at air quality, is that it really needs to be targeted at the vehicles that are driving around the most, in areas where air quality is a problem,"" he said. ""Things like buses and trucks are particularly important and so are commercial vehicles too."" No-one could accuse the car industry of rushing to solve air pollution. Manufacturers have long been accused of dragging their heels over plans to tighten the legal emissions test. And for years, they happily sold cars that they knew were far more polluting on real roads than in the official lab test. But companies are now taking the initiative with old car scrappage schemes. Ford is the latest to offer a plan, and their version insists that the older, polluting car is destroyed rather than resold. But the offer is only open until the end of December. And let's be frank, it is also an attempt to boost sales which have been flagging across the industry for the past four months. It's hard to see it making a big dent in the dirty air problem. Ford, BMW, Vauxhall and Mercedes sell around one million cars in the UK. The scrappage schemes will help support sales at a time when demand for new cars is beginning to show signs of a sustained drop for the first time in around six years. In July,new car registrationsfell for the fourth consecutive month in a row, hit by a number of factors including uncertainty over Brexit, and lack of clarity over future government plans around new levies on diesel models. The UK's last government-backed scrappage scheme came in the wake of the financial crisis and ran for nearly a year from mid-2009, helping to support the car sector which had been hit by nose-diving sales.

"Kim Wall (pictured) was researching a feature about submarines before she disappeared A woman's headless torso has been found by police searching for a Swedish journalist who went missing during a trip with a submarine inventor. Kim Wall was last seen alive on Danish entrepreneur Peter Madsen's submarine on 10 August. He initially said he had dropped her off safely near Copenhagen, but has since said she died in an accident and that he had ""buried"" her at sea. The body has been sent for forensic analysis, but is yet to be identified. Ms Wall, 30, was reported missing by her boyfriend after she failed to return from what should have been a short trip to research a feature about the inventor and his submarine. The submarine sank hours after the search for the journalist began, and Mr Madsen was charged with negligent manslaughter. Kim Wall: What we know and what we don't Who is DIY submariner Peter Madsen? Danish police believe the 40-tonne vessel was deliberately sunk by Mr Madsen, who was rescued before being arrested. The inventor, 46, told police that he had left Ms Wall's body somewhere in Koge Bay, south of Copenhagen. The torso was found on the shore by a passing cyclist. Copenhagen police spokesman Jens Moller said: ""It is clear that the police, like the media and everybody else, are speculating whether this female body is Kim Wall, but it is way too soon to tell."" The police say they cannot release any more information at this time. Ms Wall boarded Peter Madsen's submarine Nautilus on 10 August Peter Madsen's lawyer, Betina Hald Engmark, said her client has not admitted any wrongdoing. She said he had given evidence to the police during preliminary questioning and ""information from this"" had now emerged. ""My client has not confessed to anything, my client still pleads not guilty to the charges against him,"" she said. The UC3 Nautilus submarine was at one stage the world's largest privately built submarine The court case is being heard behind closed doors, but part of his explanation of what happened was released after a request from the defence and prosecution. In a statement, Copenhagen police also said that maritime authorities had determined the route the submarine travelled in Koge Bay and the Oresund strait before sinking.

She added: ""Thank you for all the support. This is setting me on the way now. The excitement's really beginning. It doesn't feel like it's really happening until people know.""

His appearance follows that of former Royal Marine and fellow amputee Cassidy Little, who took part in a ""people's"" edition of Strictly in 2015 as well as that year's Christmas show. ""The opportunity to be the first contestant with a disability to take part in Strictly's main show was too good to turn down,"" he said. ""I've got no previous dance history outside of the occasional 'worm' at a mate's party and I know this will be a challenge and a new experience.

"Crown Prince Frederik met his wife Mary at a pub in Sydney during the 2000 Olympics A Danish prince was temporarily denied entry to a bar in the Australian city of Brisbane because he did not have proper identification, local media say. Crown Prince Frederik, 49, and his entourage were reportedly only able to get into the bar with the help of diplomatic protection police officers. They are said to have told staff proof of ID in this case was not necessary. Queensland and other states in Australia have strict rules about entering premises which sell alcohol. In most cases, late-night drinkers in Queensland must have their passports or driving licences to prove their identities when entering establishments that stay open after midnight. The state government,externalsays the laws introduced in July are in place ""to minimise the risk of alcohol-related harm"". Prince Frederik and his aides were in Brisbane for a yachting regatta, local media reported. They were only allowed into the bar after civil servants gave permission for the ID requirements to be waived. Bar co-owner Phil Hogan told the Brisbane Courier Mail that the new rules were ""a nightmare"", and that foreign dignitaries should be exempted. ""This is just the tip of the iceberg with the prince. It's happening all the time with normal people,"" he said. The paper described the latest incident as a ""cringe inducing blunder"" resulting from ""the draconian lockout laws, which are regularly catching out backpackers, foreign tourists and business travellers"". About 12 French winemakers without proper ID were turned away in July from The Gresham, one of Brisbane's best-known bars, the paper reported.

"Johnson & Johnson said the safety of talc was supported by decades of scientific evidence Johnson & Johnson has been ordered to pay $417m (Â£323.4m)  to a woman who says she developed ovarian cancer after using products such as baby powder. The California jury's decision marks the largest award yet in a string of lawsuits that claim the firm did not adequately warn about cancer risks from talc-based products. A spokeswoman for Johnson & Johnson defended the products' safety. The firm plans to appeal, as it has in previous cases. ""We will appeal today's verdict because we are guided by the science,"" Carol Goodrich, spokesperson for Johnson & Johnson Consumer Inc, said in a statement. The evidence around any link between talc use and cancer is inconclusive. Blood tests spot ovarian cancer early Johnson & Johnson, headquartered in New Jersey, faces thousands of claims from women who say they developed cancer due to using the firm's products to address concerns about vaginal odour and moisture. Johnson & Johnson has lost four of five previous cases tried before juries in Missouri, which have led to more than $300m in penalties. The California lawsuit was brought by Eva Echeverria, a 63-year-old woman who said she started using baby powder when she was 11 years old. She was diagnosed with ovarian cancer 10 years ago; the diagnosis is terminal, according to lawyers working on the case. The lawsuit alleged that the company was aware of cancer risk associated with talcum powder, but concealed that information from the public. The verdict included $70m in compensatory damages and $347m in punitive damages. Analysis:James Gallagher, health editor, BBC news website Is talc safe? There have been concerns for years that using talcum powder, particularly on the genitals, may increase the risk of ovarian cancer. But the evidence is not conclusive. The International Agency for Research on Cancer classifies talc used on the genitals as ""possibly carcinogenic,external"" because of the mixed evidence. Why is there any debate? The mineral talc in its natural form does contain asbestos and does cause cancer, however, asbestos-free talc has been used in baby powder and other cosmetics since the 1970s. But the studies on asbestos-free talc give contradictory results. It has been linked to a cancer risk insome studies,external, but there are concerns that the research may be biased as they often rely on people remembering how much talc they used years ago. Other studies have argued there isno link at all,externalandthere is no link,externalbetween talc in contraceptives such as diaphragms and condoms (which would be close to the ovaries) and cancer. Also there does not seem to be a ""dose-response"" for talc, unlike with known carcinogens like tobacco where the more you smoke, the greater the risk of lung cancer. The charityOvacome,externalsays there is no definitive evidence and that the worst-case scenario is that using talc increases the risk of cancer by a third. But it adds: ""Ovarian cancer is a rare disease, and increasing a small risk by a third still gives a small risk. So even if talc does increase the risk slightly, very few women who use talc will ever get ovarian cancer.""

"This video can not be played Watch: The US witnesses the 'diamond ring' effect A total solar eclipse has wowed the US. A huge shadow cast by the Moon as it passed in front of the Sun swept across the nation, from Oregon in the west to South Carolina in the east. Millions of people moved to get into the path of darkness, putting on their protective glasses to gaze at the sky in wonder. It was the firsttotal solar eclipse,externalvisible from America's lower 48 states in 38 years, and the first since 1918 to track from coast to coast. As it happened: American eclipse The view from above the Pacific Ocean When is the next eclipse in my country? Why are eclipses so rare? Meet the man addicted to eclipses Those who went to Carbondale were not disappointed US President Donald Trump and First Lady Melania Trump saw a partial eclipse in Washington DC The spectacle got under way in earnest in Oregon at 10:16 local time (17:16 GMT; 18:16 BST). Skywatchers gathered at coastal beaches and towns witnessed the Sun's disc being completely obscured by the Moon for two minutes. But just before and just after ""totality"", they also got to see some of the classic features of a full solar eclipse. These included ""Baily's beads"" which arise as the last shafts of sunlight drive through valleys on the Moon; and the ""Diamond Ring"", which is the single brilliant point of light that signals the beginning and end of totality. From Oregon, the eclipse shadow raced on through Idaho, Montana, Wyoming, Nebraska, Kansas, Iowa, Missouri, Illinois, Kentucky, Tennessee, Georgia, North Carolina, and South Carolina. It was a journey that took roughly 90 minutes. Using a ""pinhole camera"" was the safest way to view the Sun and Moon action Space station astronaut Paolo Nespoli pictured the Moon's shadow from orbit Small towns along the path were inundated with visitors. So were the National Parks. In Carbondale, Illinois, city authorities billed their locality as the ""Eclipse Crossroads of America"" because it would enjoy totality both on Monday and when the next US eclipse occurs in 2024. As anticipated, Carbondale proved to be a huge magnet to skywatchers who made good use of the more than 60,000 extra car parking spaces organised for the day. The area also had the privilege of enjoying the longest period of darkness anywhere in the country at just over two minutes and 40 seconds. The Atlantic coastal city of Charleston was the place tasked with saying goodbye to the eclipse. Beachgoers experienced the full shadow at 14:48 local time (18:48 GMT; 19:48 BST). Although, the US had exclusive rights on totality, a partial eclipse was visible across all of North America, reaching beyond the Canadian Arctic; as well as across the north of South America down to Bolivia. In Washington DC, President Donald Trump, First Lady Melania Trump and their son, Barron, made sure they had protective glasses as they looked skyward. The Moon's shadow (dark spot) leaves the US - as pictured by Europe's Meteosat Parts of western Europe were also set to see the Moon take a chunk out of the Sun at the end of the day just before the star dipped below the horizon. It was just a small bite, but in parts of France and the Canary Islands where clouds were limited - it was no less of a spectacle. For those outside the path of the Moon's shadow or smothered by poor weather, there was always the internet. The US space agency (Nasa) streamed pictures from many vantage points including from a series of helium-filled balloons. Some of the most spectacular shots of the day came from orbit. Italian astronaut Paolo Nespoli looked down on the moving shadow from the International Space Station. And from their ""stationary"" positions some 36,000km above the planet, meteorological satellites also returned some stunning imagery.

"Katherine Guest, with Zachary, did not think there would be a problem getting on a bus A mum has said she was stopped from getting on a bus because she was breastfeeding her baby. Katherine Guest, who was on her way to a medical check-up in Bridgnorth, Shropshire, said the driver told her he feared her son could choke. The Arriva driver told her it was because of potential health and safety risks associated with breastfeeding, she said. Arriva Midlands said it was looking into the matter. Latest reaction, plus more Shropshire stories Ms Guest, 22, said she had been on her way to a routine check-up last Tuesday with 10-week old Zachary when she was refused entry to the bus.

"The four suspects in court were (L-R) Mohammed Aallaa, Mohamed Houli Chemlal, Salah al-Karib and Driss Oukabir The small Catalan town of Ripoll north of Barcelona is reeling with the news that eight of the 12 jihadist suspects killed or arrested were local residents. Best known for its Romanesque monastery, Ripoll, with about 11,000 inhabitants, is the last place you would expect a jihadist cell to operate. Four suspects have appeared in court in Madrid in connection with the attacks in Barcelona and Cambrils that killed 15 people. Police now believe the young men were brought together and radicalised in Ripoll by a local imam with suspected terrorist links. The suspects were brothers and friends of mostly Moroccan origin. Some were not out of their teens. Catalan police chief Josep LluÃ­s Trapero said the cell was believed to be 12 strong, planning the attacks for more than six months. The van-ramming plot, which killed 13 people and injured more than 100 on Las Ramblas in Barcelona, was carried out after bomb equipment accidentally blew up. That blast wrecked a house in Alcanar, 300km (186 miles) south of Ripoll. Four were arrested in connection with the attacks: Driss Oukabir, 28, Mohamed Houli Chemlal and Salah al-Karib, 34, and Mohammed Aallaa, 27. Houli Chemlal confessed that a bigger attack had been planned, judicial sources said after a hearing on Tuesday. He implied that the gas that blew up in Alcanar was to have been used. He was quoted as saying Barcelona's iconic Sagrada Familia church was among the cell's targets. Driss Oukabir denied any involvement with the cell. He said he had hired two vans to help his friends move furniture. His passport was found in the Las Ramblas van, but he said his brother Moussa - killed by police with four other suspects - had stolen his documents. Both Oukabir and Houli Chemlal have been charged and remanded in custody. Al-Karib is being held for a further 72 hours while investigations continue. Hours after the Barcelona attack, police shot and killed five on Thursday night in Cambrils: Moussa Oukabir, 17, Said Aallaa, 18, Houssaine Abouyaaqoub, 19,  Omar Hychami, 21 and Mohamed Hychami, 24. The suspects' Audi A3 car had earlier killed a woman in a second vehicle attack. Mohammed Aallaa - one of the four who appeared in court on Tuesday - is said to be the owner of the Audi A3. Three Aallaa brothers are in the group of suspects. Said was shot by police, and Youssef Aallaa is believed to have died in the Alcanar explosion. Mohammed Aallaa was released on conditional bail by the judge. It was confirmed on Monday that the remains of Abdelbaki Es Satty - a local Ripoll imam - were also found at the Alcanar explosion site. This video can not be played Inside the pretty town hiding terror suspects Younes Abouyaaqoub was the only suspect who remained on the run after escaping but wasshot dead by police on Monday. Barcelona and Cambrils attacks: What we know so far Spain attack: What do we know about the victims? The 22-year-old suspected van driver behind the assault on people in Las Ramblas was seen on CCTV around the area for up to 90 minutes after the attack. He then hijacked a car and killed the driver - who police have confirmed as the 15th victim. Spanish police circulated images of Abouyaaqoub during a five-day manhunt He was eventually killed after a five-day manhunt, wearing a fake explosive belt in rural Subirats, 40km from Barcelona. In a new twist, it has emerged that Younes Abouyaaqoub and another suspect went on a short trip to Paris in the Audi, the weekend before the attacks. French BFMTV news reports that the Spanish-registered Audi was caught on a speed camera in the Essonne region, on the edge of Paris. They stayed overnight at a hotel on the outskirts, then went shopping in Paris, before driving back to Spain, French investigators say. They are sure that the pair did not also visit Belgium, which is where the bloody November 2015 jihadist attack on Paris was planned. Like most of the suspects in the Barcelona attack, suspected mastermind Abdelbaki Es Satty, 45, had Moroccan roots. The imam moved to the town after being released from a Spanish prison in 2014, where he had spent four years for drug-trafficking offences. Abdelbaki (top right) was last seen in his rented two-bedroom apartment on Tuesday Spanish media report that he struck up a friendship with Rachid Aglif in prison, a Moroccan serving 18 years for his role in the Madrid train bombings which killed 191 people and injured hundreds in 2004. The mayor of Belgium's Vilvoorde region confirmed Satty had lived in the nearby Brussels suburb of Machelen, in the months leading up to the March 2016 suicide bombings that killed 32 people in the Belgian capital. A Belgian official told the BBC that the imam had preached at a mosque in 2015 for about five months before local elders became concerned at the ""radicalised and polarising"" nature of his religious teaching. He is then thought to have travelled to Ripoll. Satty died in an explosion at a house in Alcanar, where 120 gas canisters were found A spokesman for the local Muslim community of Ripoll told El PaÃ­s newspaper: ""It is getting harder to find an imam, so it was a big surprise when he turned up."" He said Satty lived in a two-bedroom apartment by the monastery and described him as a ""loner"" and ""unobtrusive."" Another acquaintance, quoted by AFP news agency, said Satty ""spoke little, spent time with his computer in his room, and had an old mobile phone with no internet, and few books"". The imam apparently left the mosque in June for an extended trip to Morocco, but a housemate told the BBC he had seen him last Tuesday. His home was searched by police on Saturday, and it is now widely suspected he was the cell's ringleader, and that they implemented the contingency plan that killed 15 people after his accidental death. Relatives of the suspects hold a sign saying ""We are Barcelona. We are Muslims, not terrorists"" In Ripoll, acquaintances of Younes Abouyaaqoub - the driver of the deadly Barcelona van - described him as studious and polite, showing no signs of radicalisation. One called him ""an excellent guy"". Abouyaaqoub was a qualified electrical engineer, working for a local firm. Spain's El Pais daily says Abouyaaqoub was aged four when his family moved to Ripoll from Morocco. Houssaine, one of his four siblings, was among those killed by police in Cambrils. Younes had a passion for cars - acquaintances said he had owned a Seat Ibiza, a BMW and later a Citroen C5. Reports say he and at least two others in the cell - Moussa Oukabir and Said Aallaa - played in a local football team, EFS Ripoll. In late June, after the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, some of the group reportedly began wearing Islamic clothes for the first time.

"Australians watch the government's long-awaited apology to the Stolen Generations in 2008 It's one of the most sensitive topics of modern Australia: the country's past treatment of its indigenous peoples. And its capacity to divide non-indigenous Australians has again been thrust into the spotlight, this time because of a primary school play. It has also raised debate about what is appropriate for children to be taught at school. Students at the government-run Forestville Public School in Sydney's north last week performed a history presentation titled Australia - You're Standing In It (named after a 1980s TV comedy show). While the play, presented by junior students, covered various Australian history topics, a segment performed for parents by Year 5 and 6 students about one of the nation's darkest chapters - the Stolen Generations - has sparked controversy. Tens of thousands of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children were forcibly taken from their parents by government authorities between 1883 and 1969 and placed into boys' and girls' homes, foster families or Christian missions. On turning 18 they were cast out, often scarred for life, support groups say. The policy's most widely cited motivations include that it was a protective move based on a belief the indigenous population would die out, that children were being neglected, or that it was a way of introducing religion to Aboriginal people. Some indigenous groups, however, say the main motivation was to put a swift end to Aboriginal culture. In 2008, newly elected Prime Minister Kevin Rudd issued a famous, long-awaitedapology in parliament,externalto the Stolen Generations, saying he hoped Australia could turn a new page by ""righting the wrongs of the past and so moving forward with confidence to the future"". But nine years on, the issue is still a thorny one. One parent who saw the play at Forestville was Robbie Slater. A former Australia and English Premier League footballer whose five-year-old son attends the school, Mr Slater came out in the media to say he was ""disgusted"" by the segment. ""It was bloody disgraceful,"" Mr Slater, now a TV football commentator, told local newspaperThe Manly Daily,external, adding he had walked out ""at certain stages"" during the play. ""I don't think using five, six or seven-year-old kids is appropriate to push your own political agenda,"" he added. Footballer-turned-commentator Robbie Slater, right, criticised the play However, the children presenting the Stolen Generations segment were from the nine-12 age bracket. Also, students from kindergarten to Year 4 did not watch that part of the play. Initial reports also said the play featured children dressed as nuns who were mentally and physically abusing students playing Stolen Generations children. The issue drew more visceral reaction through Sydney right-wing radio talkback host Ray Hadley, who demanded an inquiry from the New South Wales state government, and called the teachers organising the play ""imbeciles"". In his column in Sydney'sDaily Telegraph,external, Mr Hadley railed against the ""socialist engineers masquerading as teachers who organised the left-leaning display"", saying children ""go to school for an education, not to be indoctrinated by rabid left-wingers"". Why doesn't Australia have an indigenous treaty? Mr Slater and Mr Hadley also highlighted the fact children in the play held up a placard reading ""Sorry"" as an example of a political agenda being forced onto them. The play came in a tense week for race relations in Australia, with a local council in Melbournedrawing flakfrom Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, among many others, for announcing it would abandon its traditional Australia Day celebrations on 26 January. This was done out of respect for indigenous people, many of whom refer to the anniversary of the landing of the First Fleet in 1788 not as ""Australia Day"" but ""Invasion Day"". After the initial media flurry about the Forestville play, however, many parents from the school came out in support of the performance, saying schools should not shy away from the more troubling aspects of Australian history. Nina Mapson Bone, who has a son in Year 3 at the school, said ""discomfort should not be a reason not to teach our children about the facts of important events in Australia's history"". ""The overwhelming majority of parents who saw the play did not think it was inappropriate,"" she told the BBC. ""I haven't come across any other parents who agreed with that one angry parent. ""The play was factual, not political."" Jeanie Bartley, who was removed from her parents as a child, at a National Sorry Day event in 2009 Ms Mapson Bone said what her son had learned from the play was the ""compassion and understanding"" that are essential in helping fix some of the issues relating to Aboriginal reconciliation in Australia. She also said two of the most pointed allegations about the play were ill-based. ""The kids holding up the 'Sorry' sign were re-enacting scenes from when Kevin Rudd made his apology. It wasn't an agenda of the school,"" she said. ""And there were no nuns abusing children. They were teaching them. Later, the play did show kids being taken away from their parents, but there was no violence about it. It was mimed, and in a calm and peaceful way."" Ms Mapson Bone said parents had shown their backing for the school by taking morning tea to the teachers on Thursday, and signing a ""huge"" card of support. A school community Facebook page has also received more than 200 expressions of support. ""So grateful that the teachersâ¦ are teaching our children the true facts of our rich history,"" one student's grandmother wrote. ""Our Aboriginal people are grieving so much. Please acknowledge this fact. The childrenâ¦ will understand thanks to Forestville School's honesty!"" Parent Sinead Kennedy-Guy wrote: ""It was just a play done with sensitivity and finesse. And it was based on the truth. For those that are sensitive to the truth, I say suck it up and move on."" In response to calls for an inquiry into the play, a spokesman for New South Wales Education Minister Rob Stokes told the BBC the department was ""looking into the matter"", and would make no further comment.

"The public inquiry into the Grenfell fire disaster is beginning its formal work. But there have already been weeks of passionate debate about what it should cover and who should run it. Why does such passion surround what looks, on the surface, like a dry official procedure? That is partly because of dispute and uncertainty about what a public inquiry does. Firstly, it is not a court of law and it is meant to be independent. However the government decides whether to hold an inquiry in the first place, appoints its head, and has to agree what it is going to cover. Inquiries can then make recommendations about how things should change but governments do not have to accept them. The Shipman inquiry produced far-reaching recommendations And the history of public inquiries tells us something more. They are about people, not just procedure, so they reveal all kinds of conflicts in our fast-changing society over things like government secrecy, deference, and the power of professions. Dame Janet Smith - a High Court judge - chaired the inquiry into the GP and serial killer Harold Shipman. She told me what happened just after she was appointed and was told her terms of reference. That is the procedure - which has just been agreed for the Grenfell inquiry - which sets out what an inquiry is going to cover. The government wanted her to focus on organisational failures that had allowed Shipman to act undetected. But his trial had only covered a fraction of his crimes. Dame Janet sensed that the families of Shipman's victims wanted most to find out what had happened to their dead relatives. Chris Bowlby presented Archive on 4:Inquiries - Facing Our Failureson BBC Radio 4 on Saturday 19 August at 20:00 BST. Or you canlisten onlinevia the BBC Radio 4 website ""They were very anxious that I should investigate who Shipman had actually killed,"" she said. ""The government did not want me to do that. They only wanted me to look at the systems that had failed."" So after the Lord Chancellor had dictated the terms of reference to her, she decided she needed to re-jig it a bit. ""I put in a section that was capable of being extendedâ¦ but didn't explicitly say so,"" Dame Janet said. She later told the Lord Chancellor that she wanted to investigate all the deaths. ""I said my terms of reference do seem to make that a possibility,"" she told me. Dame Janet Smith wanted to cover more in the inquiry ""They were so anxious to get an inquiry underway I think they would have agreed to more or less anything."" There were highly emotional moments in the Shipman inquiry as tragic individual stories were told. ""There were occasions when I had to put my head down because I was having difficulty controlling my face,"" Dame Janet admitted. ""But the formality of the occasion helps you and them get over it."" She knew her approach was going to double the cost and the length of time for the inquiry, ""but it was the right thing to do"". So how effective was her inquiry overall? Dame Janet made several clear recommendations for change in public policy covering areas such as death certificates and drugs monitoring. But then politics came back into play and the government had to decide how far it would respond. Ministers came and went, and three different departments were involved. ""It was hopeless, like herding cats,"" Dame Janet recalled. Limited implementation of her recommendations after so much work was ""a great disappointment"". Victims and their families have played a growing role in public inquiries. Some see inquiries becoming more like the truth and reconciliation commission seen in South Africa after apartheid, allowing voices to be heard, and stories to be told in an official setting. Sir Paul Jenkins, who was the Treasury Solicitor, the government's top legal official, between 2006 and 2014, said he had experienced in inquiries a sense of ""a healing process, giving the victims giving the survivors a voice so they can be heard, listened to, understood"". Politicians, he believes, can see value in this as a safety valve when feelings are running high. By contrast, when an inquiry is seen to have ignored those most affected, it can fuel a politically powerful sense of injustice. The Saville inquiry into Bloody Sunday - the killing in 1972 of 13 civilians by the army in Londonderry - was the second inquiry into that event. The first, by the Lord Chief Justice, Lord Widgery, soon after the event, was widely seen as a whitewash. Saville, said Sir Paul, ""had to deal with the legacy of the bad inquiry so if he had been anything other than obsessed with the detailâ¦ it wouldn't have been of any value at all."" ""It was bound to take a very long time,"" he added. Sir Martin Moore-Bick has already faced calls for his resignation from the Grenfell inquiry ""The good legacy,"" he explained, ""is it led to David Cameron standing up and saying sorry - when something has gone wrong and the state is at fault that is how inquiries should end up."" ""The bad thing is - [now] in ministers' minds all inquiries take 12 years and cost Â£200m."" Worries about cost and length are part of a growing frustration within government about public inquiries. Politicians take the initiative in setting them up, and decide how far to implement their recommendations. But the independent way in which they are conducted makes politicians nervous. A new law on inquiries in 2005 gave governments more powers to restrict what inquiries can do. Dame Janet Smith said that when she pointed out to civil servants that the law's provisions allowed a government department to interfere in an inquiry, they replied: ""Oh we don't think we'll ever need to use them."" ""They wanted to get a little bit more control,"" she argues. ""But they shouldn't have control - the inquiry should be wholly independent of government."" The Grenfell inquiry is likely to be prolonged, emotional and constantly in dispute. It will be a major challenge for it to match, in its investigation and reporting, the depth of anger about what happened in that terrible fire. And it will be the next chapter in the turbulent history of how Britain has inquired into many of its worst moments, exposing a society and its underlying tensions as it works out why things sometimes go so wrong.

" A thick layer of acrid, blue smoke hovers just above the waterfront slums that skirt Lagos lagoon, filtering out sunrise and sunset. This man-made mist that clings to the rusted shack rooftops comes from the countless fish-smoking cabins that drive the slum economy. There’s an uninterrupted view of the city’s dramatic sprawl of poverty from the road bridges that carry daily commuters between the islands and the mainland. Fishing and sand-dredging boats drift to work, heading deep into the lagoon. Many of the slums’ wooden huts are on stilts, others are just basic shacks shoddily built on the unstable ground of trodden-down rubbish dumps. Nobody knows exactly how many people live in Lagos, but they all agree on one thing – Nigeria's biggest city is growing at a terrifying rate. The UN says 14 million. The Lagos State government thinks it’s nearer 21 million, as rural Nigerians are drawn by the hope of a better life to one of Africa’s few mega-cities. By 2050 Nigeria will have twice the population it has today, more than half will live in cities, and about 60% of them will be under 25. In an overcrowded neighbourhood on mainland Lagos, Muktar Abdulhamid, 36, is pressing shirts with a heavy, old-fashioned iron filled with charcoals. Abdulhamid is from a rural village in the northern state of Kano, and he’s left his wife and one-year-old child at home and come here to try to make money. Muktar Abdulhamid: Just one of many rural Nigerians drawn to Lagos “This isn’t what I intended to be doing. I want to do business – to buy and sell,” he says. “It’s not easy to leave your wife, your child, it’s lonely, but I have no choice – it’s for the future of the family.” There are few good jobs and housing is in high demand, but at least there are opportunities. Every week tens of thousands of people arrive in Lagos, heading to neighbourhoods where friends and relatives have come before – many end up in the slums. But Lagos State is planning tower blocks and transformation, reclaiming land from the sea for ambitious new developments. In a rush to transform the city, the waterfront slums are being cleared, court rulings are being ignored, and luxury apartment blocks are springing up. Can Lagos persuade wealthy investors to buy into a futuristic vision, while helping pull the poorest people out of poverty? In about 30 years Nigeria will overtake the US to become the world’s third most populated country behind China and India. It vies with South Africa for the status of the continent’s biggest economy, but it’s now in recession - beset by a drop in oil prices, and having to fund the fight against both Boko Haram Islamists and separatists targeting oil pipelines in the Niger Delta. Like everywhere else in Africa trying to break out of poverty, Nigeria hopes fast population growth will bring it a “demographic dividend” – a young workforce that can drive economic growth. If they can all be put to work. Already there’s migration north to Libya and on to Europe, and the young who are left idle and without much hope are easily radicalised by Boko Haram. It’s going to take great management, smart politics and increasing security and stability to turn rapid population growth into a positive and avoid the potential for disaster. Source: Google/ Landsat / Copernicus “Africa’s Model Megacity” flashes up in the glitzy video of beautiful sunsets and impressive artists' impressions of the big Lagos city development plan. Soaring luxury skyscrapers sit alongside a port, enterprise parks and a new city-wide transport system of train lines, ferries and bus lanes. But in the waterfront slums circling the lagoon, this vision is a threat to livelihoods, not a hope for the future. Elebiomayo Folashade was a relatively well-off woman living in a sand-slum – but now she’s angry. Pulling up her elegant blue dress, she leans down to inspect the damage done to one of her boats by security forces, and begins to cry. “They destroyed my boats and my husband’s boats and now I cannot pay the school fees, so the children have been withdrawn from school,” she says. “I am old – what am I going to do now?” Many boats with huge holes in their hulls have been hauled up and abandoned on a beach that just a year ago was busy with work. Ebute Ilaje is a place that has lived off sand-dredging for decades. Wooden boats with food-sack sails would bring sand from deep in the lagoon to sell as building material, employing thousands of people. But then the government “taskforce” came – smashing holes in their boats and threatening to burn down the slum if they continued to work. Now Folashade’s livelihood has gone – as has that of many in a community that depended on the sand-dredgers to keep the economy afloat. Many believe what’s labelled a security crackdown against crime is an excuse to drive them out. “The state government is interested in the land in all these waterfront communities... so the rich can benefit from it,” says former dredger Oladipupo Aireomiye. His fears stem from the recent clearance of Otodo Gbame slum, which went ahead despite a court order halting its destruction. Otodo Gbame, after the bulldozers went in The bulldozers came in with the taskforce, smashing tin shacks, burning anything wooden to the ground. “The police seized our documents and fired tear gas… some people fled, others were shot,” says Maxwell Hunga, who lived in Otodo Gbame. The moment you demolish a slum, naturally two or three more slums will spring up because people need somewhere to sleep “The most challenging thing we are facing is the threat of eviction that is hanging around the community’s neck,” says Samuel Akinrolabu from the Nigerian Slum and Informal Settlement Federation. “Over 40 communities are under the threat of eviction and 300,000 people would be rendered homeless eventually if this action is carried out,” he says. “But forced eviction will not make slums disappear. Rather the moment you demolish a slum, naturally two or three more slums will spring up because people need somewhere to sleep."" Klote Kakini, fisherman They have the same fears in Ago Egun, the next slum along, where the men catch fish and the women smoke them on circular wire grills. Their shacks are built on a floating rubbish dump - trodden down and compacted over the years, its paths wobble disconcertingly underfoot. Klote Kakini is an old fisherman whose father lived here before him. He is worried his family will be evicted while he’s in the boat. “When we leave to catch fish, we are afraid something will happen to our wives and children at home,” he says. “Maybe the government will send agents to demolish everything or scatter our families.” But Steve Ayorinde, the Lagos State and governor’s spokesman, says these fears are unfounded: “This is a government with a human face, this is a government that won’t just descend on helpless citizens and just bulldoze them away.” He denies they have been heavy-handed by driving people from land they have lived on for many years. “I’m not aware that there has been any community that has been living within the waterfront for generations. It’s always a convenient lie for people to tell just to demonise the government,” he says. “All over the world there will always be the need for regeneration of certain areas. It’s happened in New York, in London... and Lagos is not an exception.” He gives two examples where people were resettled and compensation was paid. “Of course at some point there will be mild resistance, but this government believes in dialogue – in engaging with people so they can see the bigger picture of what the benefits would be.” But Samuel Akinrolabu describes a different reality: “The basic reason is land-grabbing, to be honest. Lagos government has seen that the waterfront communities are prime land where they can build the five-star hotels... and people can wake up and see the ocean view.” He believes the answer to redevelopment is to leave people where they are, improve their lives in situ and create new space to house them. ""We are in an urban age and people are going to keep coming, so we are just going to have to find more creative ways to accommodate more people,” says Taibat Lawanson, associate professor of urban and regional planning at the University of Lagos. And they do keep coming - from other towns and cities, and from remote rural communities. Lagos has become Nigeria’s centre of gravity. Lagos is crowded, chaotic, and crumbling. In the slums of the old city the spirits of the dead appear to have returned to cleanse it of evil and pray for its peace and prosperity. The tall men, wrapped in white, jump and crouch, sweeping their long sticks at the crowd. Their heads are veiled and topped with brightly coloured hats, as they spin through the streets towards the palace of their “Oba” – the king of Lagos. The Eyo Festival (pronounced Ay-oh) usually marks the death of the city’s most important or influential people, but this ceremony – the first in seven years – is celebrating the 50th anniversary of Lagos State. The original spot where 15th Century Yoruba fishermen settled on Lagos Island is now an edgy, poor, densely packed neighbourhood. Degraded buildings lean into each other, appearing to sag under the weight of people packing the balconies to watch the procession. The roads are potholed, there are few schools or clinics, let alone parks or playing fields – it desperately needs a new lease of life. Lateef Shelobo, Lagos State Urban Renewal Agency “Lagos has no choice but to go up,” says Lateef Sholebo, head of Lagos State Urban Renewal Agency. “How are we going to accommodate all the population? There is no way we can continue to sprawl.”After 25 years as a city planner in Los Angeles, he has now returned home to put into practice the lessons of urban renewal he has learned. Emerging from the rusty tin rooftops and towering above the Eyo parade route is a multi-storey apartment block – a gleaming, modern show home rising from the slum. “This project is very important because it shows the people in the community how a slum area can be transformed from what it used to be to a more modern, more sustainable environment,” he says, enthusiastically. Eleven families lived on the land – they were persuaded to combine their plots and stay elsewhere while the 48-flat tower block was built. Now they have 11 modern apartments to move into – and 37 extra new homes for their neighbours. “The air-space is useless – nobody is using it. Now we are able to go vertical we can reduce the overcrowding,” says Sholebo. “If we are able to convince all the rest of the families to participate in this kind of programme I think it’s better for them, it’s better for the government – and it’s better for everybody.” But it took years to build and was hugely expensive - too expensive for the government to roll out across Lagos. The city needs to be rebuilt without moving whole communities out. That’s where Sholebo’s American experience could make the difference – using imaginative tax tricks to generate finance for the infrastructure to bring in private developers. “We have to come up with different ways, or creative ways to provide such affordable housing,” says Sholebo. But those with the money to invest are looking for better returns elsewhere. Landmark Towers From the 11th-storey penthouse of the luxury Landmark Towers there’s an amazing view of the ocean and the sprawling waterfront developments. “We are trying to create West Africa’s first one-stop shop, live, work and play destination,” explains property developer Paul Onwuanibe. The Landmark Group chief executive lives in the penthouse suite, and from the large, open terrace points out what will go where on the five-hectare, $100m development. There’s already a Hard Rock Cafe, a fine dining restaurant, and an events centre which seats 4,000 people – hugely popular for expensive weddings. Land has been cleared for a Marriott hotel, a small shopping mall, an IMAX cinema, two office blocks and two apartment buildings. Here, people can avoid the Lagos chaos of overcrowding and terrible traffic congestion – the selling point is that if you can afford to live here, you never need to leave. Onwuanibe’s five hectares are dwarfed by the massive Eko Atlantic project next door. The Eko Atlantic development Earthmovers are landscaping this vast spur of land reclaimed from the sea, roads are being built and the first few tower blocks are beginning to take shape. It’s a stark contrast from life in the slums – a symbol of the vast inequality in Lagos. “There will always remain the super-rich and there will always remain the people just simply below the poverty line, but the hope is that over the next few years you will see that gap bridged as more people get more jobs,” says Onwuanibe. “I believe in trickle-down economics – so that wealth you create actually goes through the system, so the very people that feel that they’re displaced end up getting helped.” Rural Yanoko is a long way from the sprawl and chaos of Lagos. Most women in this village have about seven children. That’s typical for the surrounding region - the countryside overlapping northern Nigeria and southern Niger. It's the area with the highest birth rate in the world. And this birth rate is helping put Nigeria well on its way to becoming the world’s third-largest country by 2050. More than half of women are married before they are 15 and having many children is considered a sign of good fortune – and they are a good source of farm labour. There’s a huge push to reduce the fertility rate, but the population here is expected to triple in the next 30 years. There’s little for people to do, and lack of opportunity drives them to the city. Muktar Abdulhamid has optimism written across his chest. The 36-year-old wears a bright Superman T-shirt while very precisely ironing shirts in the overcrowded Lagos mainland neighbourhood of Agege. It wasn’t what he intended to do when came here from Yanoko, but well-paying work is rare and it helps him get by while waiting for that big business opportunity to come along. “When I arrived I thought it would be easy, but then I realised how much harder it was to get work, but you can’t just sit here without a job,” says Muktar. “I want to buy and sell, to have a shop in Kano and make enough money to go back to school to get a Western education.” Many people in this particular Lagos neighbourhood are from northern Nigeria and speak the same language, and so it feels a little more like home. But he misses the wife and young son he left behind nine months ago when he came to make it in the big city. Back home in Yanoko it’s the rainy season - and bright green fields jump out from the stark background of burnt orange mud buildings. There are only six cars, electricity is something they had for about a week before the new power lines fell dormant, and since the only bridge collapsed four years ago, it’s been even harder to reach the nearest health centre 27km away. Seven thousand people live here - a two-hour ride on a rocky road from Kano, which is the biggest city in northern Nigeria. Muktar Abdulhamid’s family are sitting together to talk about the man who left it all to make his fortune in the city. “We don’t have money to eat, so we had to send the boy to go look for money,” says his sister Ramatu Abdulkarim. “He is getting a little bit every day, just enough to survive, thank God. Sometimes he sends us 40, 50, or 60,000 Naira,” Muktar’s sister says. That’s between $110 and $165 (£85-£125), equivalent to two months’ worth of the annual income the family makes from farming maize, rice, soya or chillies. “We use the money for the farm and for buying food and clothing for the children – he also sent money for [his wife] Ramatu. “She’s not comfortable that he’s not close to her. And he’s not happy that he’s far from her.” Ramatu Muktar, 22, nods in agreement as one-year-old Abdulhamid plays on the floor – the whole family are praying Muktar will do well and take them both to Lagos to be with him. She’s shy and says little, but Muktar’s good friend and cousin Saidu Yahaya says it’s all about having money – to improve life and plan for the unexpected. “They are making money there, but you know how things are, it’s meagre money. You have to manage the little you have for survival,” says Saidu. About 150 young men from Yanoko are also trying to get work in Lagos – and the road to town is only going to get busier. “Lagos has always had that mixed blessing of having to deal with an influx of people. Unfortunately for us in the last two or three years it has been a deluge,” says the Lagos State and Governor’s spokesman Steve Ayorinde. He says 27 or 28 of the 36 states in Nigeria are struggling to pay local government salaries and it’s harder for people to migrate abroad. “We want other people to be here – to bring ideas, to bring values, to bring innovation, but we’re just unable to deal with it endlessly,” he says. “The prosperity of Lagos, in a way, is also tied to how open it is... so visitors will always have a great role to play in Lagos if they play by the rules.” More than half the population in Lagos is already under 25, and if there was work for them to do, and the birth rate was to slow down, the economy would get a welcome boost. This is where the “demographic dividend” comes in - an opportunity to take advantage of a big and active workforce. But if enough jobs aren’t created, the country suffers from the other side of that coin. Too many unemployed young people provides a fertile recruiting ground for Islamists like Boko Haram or a market for the people-smugglers peddling dreams of wealth and a better life in Europe. So if Africa's biggest challenge is everyone's problem, what's the solution? The newly-trained staff in the glossy new Lagos factory are carefully packing phones into boxes. As production lines go it's small, but for “the first indigenous mobile, tablet, phone and computer assembly plant in Nigeria”, at least it's a start. The company, Afrione, wants to tap into the big market for devices that a fast-growing young population provides, by producing cheap phones and tablets with the tagline “Made in Nigeria”. At the moment at least 90% of the components are imported, but company director Lekan Akinjide wants to steadily decrease that by 4 or 5% a year. “What we are actually doing fundamentally is starting the process - no-one else has really tried, no one else has really invested in a factory and the training of a skilled workforce,” he says. “We've looked at China, we've looked at India, we've also looked at what people have done here and tried not to make the mistakes they have made.” China had a fast growing population. It had deep and pervasive poverty, it was a rural economy and it turned itself around in a generation, mainly through manufacturing. But the window of time to take advantage of the “demographic dividend” is short – lots of jobs are needed now – and it’s perhaps worth looking a little closer to home. There are some places in Africa where a new industrial revolution is seen as the key to putting the idle youth to work and cashing in on a growing population. Ethiopia’s economy is dwarfed by that of Nigeria, but it’s the continent’s fastest growing and is betting it all on massive infrastructure investment and an industrial revolution to transform a nation of farmers into makers. There are beautiful new six-lane highways, an electric railway line to the ocean, and vast estates of social housing are being built with government-run mortgage schemes to get the poor on the housing ladder. And Nigeria knows massive investment in infrastructure is the answer to a growing economy and to get a congested city moving. The population is even outgrowing the supply of electricity. Generators which fill the gaps are a constant background soundtrack to the city. Taibat Lawanson, planning expert Stage one of Nigeria’s first electric railway line - through Lagos - is almost finished, but it can’t start moving a quarter of a million people a day from the suburbs to the city until its own power station is up and running. “There’s a lot of new infrastructure being built, but it’s skewed and the effects are not felt by the common man,” says planning expert Taibat Lawanson. “There’s a gap between the rich and the poor.” She believes by just improving transport links between residential suburbs and downtown, the government is missing the point – new satellite cities have to be planned and built so people can work near their homes and avoid commuting. “The government has got to understand that people are going to keep coming. “The current thinking is that they need to reverse urbanisation and get people to go back to the villages and stay away, but that’s not going to work.” The luxury waterfront developer Paul Onwuanibe says inequality is everywhere, but he believes it's “a little more acute, or visible” in Lagos. “That’s just part and parcel of mega-cities, but one of the things the government would have to think of is some kind of social platform... some sort of welfare platform that catches people below a certain safety net. “As this country and this city develops, you will see the gap bridged to some extent. “There will be a lot of people that will always remain under the poverty line just because of the sheer numbers,” he says, but believes the trickle-down from a growing economy and better private sector will see more people better off. So what does Steve Ayorinde, the Lagos Governor and State spokesman, think the city will look like in 50 years? “The pride of the black race,” he answers quickly. “Where technology will drive practically everything.” He talks about making Lagos a “smart city” - but millions of people living in slums just want better education and health, somewhere to live and somewhere to work. “Just build modern houses for us - we are happy with where we are living,” says Moses Sangoloke, a long-time resident of the threatened Ago Egun fishing slum, who chairs the community development association. The government knows it needs to build. The people will keep coming. Lagos will keep growing. Built with Shorthand",Positive,1.0
"The productivity boost expected from electric dynamos was slow to materialise For investors in Boo.com, WebVan and eToys,the bursting of the dotcom bubble,externalcame as a bit of a shock. Companies like this raised vast sums on the promise that the worldwide web would change everything. Then, in the spring of 2000, stock markets collapsed. Some economists had long been sceptical about the promise of computers. In 1987, we didn't have the web, but spreadsheets and databases were appearing in every workplace - and having, it seemed, no impact whatsoever. Boo.com famously collapsed in May 2000 after failing to raise additional finance The leading thinker on economic growth,Robert Solow, famously quipped,external: ""You can see the computer age everywhere but in the productivity statistics."" It's not easy to track the overall economic impact of innovation but the best measure we have is something called ""total factor productivity"". When it's growing, that means the economy is somehow squeezing more output out of inputs, such as machinery, human labour and education. In the 1980s, when Robert Solow was writing, it was growing at the slowest rate for decades - slower even than during the Great Depression. Technology seemed to be booming but productivity was almost stagnant. Economists called it the ""productivity paradox"". For a hint about what was going on, rewind 100 years. Another remarkable new technology was proving disappointing: electricity. Some corporations were investing in electric dynamos and motors and installing them in the workplace. Yet the expected surge in productivity did not come. 50 Things That Made the Modern Economyhighlights the inventions, ideas and innovations which have helped create the economic world in which we live. It is broadcast on the BBC World Service. You can findmore information about the programme's sourcesandlisten onlineorsubscribe to the programme podcast. The potential for electricity seemed clear. Thomas Edison and Joseph Swan independently invented usable light bulbs in the late 1870s. In 1881, Edison built electricity generating stations at Pearl Street in Manhattan and Holborn in London. Edison's Pearl Street Station was the first commercial central power plant in the world Within a year, he was selling electricity as a commodity. A year later, the first electric motors were driving manufacturing machinery. Yet by 1900, less than 5% of mechanical drive power in American factories was coming from electric motors. The age of steam lingered. A steam-powered factory must have been awe-inspiring. The mechanical power came from a single massive steam engine, which turned a central steel drive shaft that ran along the length of the factory. Sometimes it would run outside and into a second building. This steam-powered cotton factory, pictured in 1830, relied on an intricate set of belts and gears Subsidiary shafts, connected via belts and gears, drove hammers, punches, presses and looms. The belts could even transfer power vertically through a hole in the ceiling to a second or even third floor. Expensive ""belt towers"" enclosed them to prevent fires from spreading through the gaps. Everything was continually lubricated by thousands of drip oilers. Steam engines rarely stopped. If a single machine in the factory needed to run, the coal fires needed to be fed. The cogs whirred, the shafts span and the belts churned up the grease and the dust, and there was always the risk that a worker might snag a sleeve or bootlace and be dragged into the relentless, all-embracing machine. Some factory owners did replace steam engines with electric motors, drawing clean and modern power from a nearby generating station. But given the huge investment this involved, they were often disappointed with the savings. Until about 1910, plenty of entrepreneurs looked at the new electrical drive system and opted for good old-fashioned steam. Why? Because to take advantage of electricity, factory owners had to think in a very different way. They could, of course, use an electric motor in the same way as they used steam engines. It would slot right into their old systems. But electric motors could do much more. Electricity allowed power to be delivered exactly where and when it was needed. Small steam engines were hopelessly inefficient but small electric motors worked just fine. So a factory could contain several smaller motors, each driving a small drive shaft. Electricity meant you could organise factories - and workers - along the logic of a production line As the technology developed, every workbench could have its own machine tool with its own little electric motor. Power wasn't transmitted through a single, massive spinning drive shaft but through wires. A factory powered by steam needed to be sturdy enough to carry huge steel drive shafts. One powered by electricity could be light and airy. Steam-powered factories had to be arranged on the logic of the driveshaft. Electricity meant you could organise factories on the logic of a production line. Old factories were dark and dense, packed around the shafts. New factories could spread out, with wings and windows allowing natural light and air. In the old factories, the steam engine set the pace. In the new factories, workers could do so. This 1909 jewellery worker benefitted from electric light and tools Factories could be cleaner and safer - and more efficient, because machines needed to run only when they were being used. But you couldn't get these results simply by ripping out the steam engine and replacing it with an electric motor. You needed to change everything: the architecture and the production process. And because workers had more autonomy and flexibility, you even had to change the way they were recruited, trained and paid. Factory owners hesitated, for understandable reasons. Of course they didn't want to scrap their existing capital. But maybe, too, they simply struggled to think through the implications of a world where everything needed to adapt to the new technology. In the end, change happened. It was unavoidable. Mains electricity became cheaper and more reliable. American workers become more expensive thanks to a series of new laws that limited immigration from a war-torn Europe. Average wages soared and hiring staff became more about quality and less about quantity. Trained workers could use the autonomy that electricity gave them. And as more factory owners figured out how to make the most of electric motors, new ideas about manufacturing spread. Come the 1920s, productivity in American manufacturing soared in a way never seen before or since. Henry Ford famously automated large parts of the car production process You would think that kind of leap forward must be explained by a new technology. But no. The economic historian Paul David gives much of the credit to the fact that manufacturers had finally figured out how to use technology that was nearly 50 years old. Which puts Robert Solow's quip in a new light. How Diesel's engine changed the world Battery bonanza: From frogs' legs to mobiles and electric cars Rise of the robots: What advances mean for workers How the lift transformed the shape of our cities By 2000 - about 50 years after the first computer program - productivity was picking up a bit. Two economists,Eric Brynjolfsson and Lorin Hitt, published research,externalshowing that many companies had invested in computers for little or no reward while others had reaped big benefits. What explained the difference was whether the companies had been willing to reorganise to take advantage of what computers had to offer. That often meant decentralising, outsourcing, streamlining supply chains and offering more choice to customers. You couldn't just take your old systems and add better computers. You needed to do things differently. Online retail giant Amazon continues to exploit new technology, using robots in its warehouses and drones for deliveries The web is younger still. It was barely a decade old when the dotcom bubble burst. When the electric dynamo was as old as the web is now, factory owners were still attached to steam. The really big changes were only just appearing on the horizon. The thing about a revolutionary technology is that it changes everything - that's why we call it revolutionary. And changing everything takes time and imagination and courage - and sometimes just a lot of hard work.

"Suranne Jones returns to her role as Dr Gemma Foster after two years A lot has changed for Suranne Jones since we last saw her in Bafta-winning TV series Doctor Foster, in which she plays a GP who suspects her husband is cheating on her. Two years down the line, Jones has now become a mother - and says this has given her a new awareness of what mum-of-one Gemma Foster went through. ""Being a wife and a mother made me realise the gravitas of that unit falling apart, because I'd go home at night and I'd have a baby to put to bed,"" she says. ""So I think it definitely made me realise when two people get together and have a child out of love and then they split... what it is to parent a child and be in each other's lives when you are damaged and hurt without damaging and hurting a child."" Jones brought her son to set - he doesn't appear in the show, but ""looked much better than I did"" on camera, she jokes. She's now looking forward to some down time with him. ""The work/life balance for anyone is hard, so I try to keep work separate,"" she explains. ""I feel very, very grateful because I did a lot of work and now I'm taking a lot of time off. So I'm there until Christmas now, just down the play park in my Converse."" The second series of the BBC One drama takes up the action as Gemma's estranged husband Simon (Bertie Carvel) and his new family return to the fictional town of Parminster, where she lives and works. They are dealing with the bitter repercussions of divorce - with their son, Tom, caught in the middle. One promotional image shows Gemma Foster with a wound where her wedding ring should be Jones admits it can be ""uncomfortable"" viewing at times but says the show has a ""weird, sexy edge to it"". ""We all know what it feels like to be in a room with an ex-partner,"" she goes on. ""Everybody has had a relationship, everyone has had exes, everybody has been in difficult circumstances. I'm sure myself and Bertie have had those thoughts and feelings; otherwise we wouldn't be able to draw on them. ""But at the same time, with the style of writing and the style of the programme, you're able to go further. ""It has a fantastical edge as well as being deep-rooted in naturalism. It also has an exaggerated way of showing how far you could go if you really wanted to."" It's safe to say it wasn't an amicable break-up for Gemma and Simon Foster Carvel, who played Miss Trunchbull in West End musical Matilda, says he found Mike Bartlett's writing ""exciting"" and that the Doctor Foster plot was a ""real page-turner"". ""He gives us incredibly three-dimensional characters"", says the actor, adding that it was ""really fun"" to play a character who makes the audience change their opinion about him as the drama progresses. ""Often you find yourself looking at something from a really different point of view,"" he says. ""That's what's exciting about this series as a whole."" Jones says the original plan was to give Gemma a new look. After conducting a screen test, though, it was agreed that it just didn't work. ""She's moved on, but actually she's comfortable with her bob and her work and she's put up her walls,"" says the former Coronation Street actress. ""It was the right decision to move her on but leave her embalmed in a way. ""And what I got, as well as being exciting and dark and sexy and thrilling and all those things, I looked at them both and thought, 'You're both really hurt' and I hadn't seen that before."" The Doctor Foster team were going to give Gemma a new look but instead left her ""embalmed"" Bartlett - the man behind award-winning play King Charles III, recently filmed by the BBC - says he originally intended Doctor Foster to have a single series. ""But when we were shooting it, I started to realise there could more - there could be another story or a further story to tell,"" he explains. The first series' final scene saw Gemma and her son together, seeing her former husband with his pregnant new partner. ""It looks like a happy ending, but there are lots of threads untied"", Bartlett goes on. ""There's more to tell, so when we had the opportunity, I thought we should.""

"This video can not be played Eclipse-chasing couple ready for backyard blackout On 21 August, more than seven million people across the US are expected to witness the first total solar eclipse to cross the North American continent from ocean to ocean since 1918. Due in part to some cosmic geometry, the Moon will momentarily obscure the Sun and cast a lunar shadow across the Earth's surface, blanketing parts of the US in darkness, causing temperatures to drop and illuminating stars and planets in the middle of the day. The last time the US experienced a solar eclipse was 1979, but it has been 99 years since the celestial event crossed the entire continent. The 2017 eclipse will also mark the first solar eclipse exclusive to the US since before the nation's founding in 1776,experts say.,external The Moon travels between the Earth and Sun about once a month. However, due to its tilted orbit - compared to the Earth's orbit around the Sun - the Moon is usually too high or too low in the sky to directly block the Sun's light. But once about every 18 months during the new Moon phase, it lines up directly between the Earth and Sun, creating the conditions for a solar eclipse. The celestial phenomenon, or coincidence, occurs when the Sun, Moon and Earth all align at just the right point in the Moon's orbit, giving the Moon the appearance of being the same size as the much larger Sun. The Sun is actually 400 times wider than the Moon and also 400 times farther away. As the Sun's powerful rays disappear, its outermost atmosphere, known as the corona, becomes visible to the naked eye and creates a ring of fire around the Moon's disc. The darkest part of the moon's shadow - theumbra- causes a total solar eclipse. The lighter part - thepenumbra- is where only a portion of the sun's light is obscured, causing a partial eclipse. Why do we associate eclipses with the end of the world? The Sun's rays are so powerful you can feel their warmth from 150 million km away, which is why staring into the Sun too long could cause serious eye damage. It allows ultraviolet (UV) light to flood the retina and burn the light-sensitive cells, and since there are no pain receptors in the retina to trigger what is happening, it could cause permanent blurry vision and blindness. APennsylvania school district,externalhas gone as far as scrapping recess during the solar eclipse over concerns that students could suffering eye damage from looking at the sun. This video can not be played How to tell if your solar eclipse glasses are safe Scientists have cautioned that anyone watching the eclipse should wear protective eyewear. Take measures to make sure you are not causing long-term damage by purchasing a pair of special eclipse glasses, which block out more than 99.9% of the Sun's light, or a pair of binoculars fitted with a specialised solar filter. You can also construct a pinhole viewer, which projects the light onto a piece a paper, by using a cardboard box, a sheet of white paper, aluminium foil, a craft knife, scissors, a drawing pin, duct tape and glue. But glasses can - and should - come off during totality, when the Sun is completely blocked. Onlookers can spot the corona, the crown around the Sun as it radiates from the Moon's black disc, and Regulus, a nearby bright star. If conditions are perfect look for Jupiter, Mars, Venus and Mercury, which could be visible, as well as surrounding sunset colours. Read more about safe ways to watch the eclipse An estimated 12 million people live in the eclipse's path totality, a 70-mile (112 km) swath of land between Oregon and South Carolina during which the sun's disc is completely masked by the Moon and the day slips into night. Another 18 million people are within a short drive of catching the view while an additional 500 million people will be able to glimpse a partial eclipse from other areas in the US, Canada, Mexico, parts of South America and north-western Europe. The total eclipse is scheduled to begin at 10:16 local time (17:16 GMT) in Government Point, Oregon, travelling across Idaho, Wyoming, Nebraska, North Carolina, Georgia and South Carolina, where it will end at 14:48 local time (18:48 GMT). But the celestial show really begins earlier than that - viewers in Oregon will start to enjoy the partial eclipse at 09:05 local time (16:05 GMT).    Reset Calculator Read more fromNasa The amount of time each place in the eclipse's path of totality will be shrouded in complete darkness depends on the speed of the shadow at that time. For those watching on the edge of the path, the duration of totality will be shorter. For example, those standing on the very edge of the path may only experience seconds of darkness.

Startled by the dramatic shift in light and temperature, some animals have reportedlychanged their behaviourto reflect the twilight hours during a solar eclipse. Owls may start to call, crickets could start chirping and birds may go to roost. But much of what is recorded about animal behaviour is anecdotal evidence, making it unclear exactly how certain animals may react. A study published in theJournal of Fish Biology in 1998,externalfound that daytime fish in reefs near the Galapagos swam to shelter during totality while nocturnal fish were more likely to emerge.

"New cladding tests have shown not only that there are widespread problems with materials used in buildings, but also within institutions that we charge with keeping us safe. The government has announced a review of building regulations. To be successful, it will need to take on a sector that struggles with respecting its own rules. The last significant results of a set of large-scale fire tests were released today. They imply that 228 buildings have cladding that may require replacement or modification. You would be forgiven for having lost the thread of how we got here. But the rough story so far goes like this: after Grenfell, the government effectively commissioned an audit of buildings across England to establish what type of aluminium cladding was used on which buildings. They also audited the types of insulation that lay underneath them. They found three broad types of aluminium cladding in use based on how well they could resist fire: First, so-called ""PE"" cladding. This is the type used at Grenfell: its name comes from the fact that it has a polyethylene (plastic) core. This is the least fire-resistant type of panelling. Second, so-called ""FR"" (fire resistant) cladding, which is a bit better in a fire. Third, so-called ""A2"" cladding, which has a mineral core of limited combustibility. Armed with that information, the government commissioned six large-scale tests which sought to establish which types of insulation could safely be used with each of these cladding types. These fire tests are rather large enterprises: they mock up large-scale models of different wall systems using different combinations of insulation and cladding. They then light a fire under them to watch what happens. Fire test rig used at the BRE, with reporter for scale. The empty cavity at the bottom is where the fire is placed. The government commissioned two tests for each aluminium cladding type: one with a traditional mineral wool insulation, which is basically fire-proof. And one with a combustible insulation - a so-called ""PIR"" foam, which is the type of insulation used at Grenfell. Such tests are really supposed to happenbeforedesigns using combustible materials are installed on buildings (we have written rather a lot aboutwhy this process did not happen previously- but we will return to some of those issues). The results came in as follows:""FR"" cladding passed when paired with non-combustible insulation,external. Plastic combustible insulation passed when it had the protection ofthe most fire-proof aluminium panels,external. But otherwise,all,externalthe,externaltests,externalfailed. One of the original six tests is still outstanding, but it is almost certain to pass. However, the government has commissioned a seventh test. The rationale for it is that not all plastic foams are alike. The original tests used so-called PIR foam insulation. But there is another popular type of combustible plastic foam, known as ""phenolic"" foam, which is held to have quite different fire performance. The test rig at the BRE before the alumnium cladding was installed for the first test using PIR insulation and PE cladding. This shows the interior design of the cladding. The silver foil covers the insulation. The vertical yellow stripes are firebreaks intended to stop the fire moving horizontally. The black stripes are firebreaks designed to stop vertical fire spread It was conceivable that a phenolic could pass the test with FR-grade cladding, even if PIR did not. So that was the seventh test - the test for which we got the results today. The phenolic did, indeed, perform a little better than the PIR - but it still failed. The phenolic was deemed to have failed the test after 28 minutes. The equivalent PIR test lasted just 25 minutes. Kingspan,  a manufacturer of phenolic insulation, said that they intended to commission ""further tests of phenolic insulation in combination with a range of FR and non-combustible"" alumnium panels in order to improve the evidence base available. They expected that phenolics would pass the test when mounted under non-combustible panels, just as PIR foams had. Altogether, that test means the government knows of 228 buildings with cladding that is of a configuration which failed the test. The lesson appears to be: if you must use combustible insulation, box it in with panels of limited combustibility. And if you really want to use FR cladding, you need to pair it with fireproof insulation. But there is a bigger result to these tests. The tests reveal the failure of some of the institutions we have charged with making sure that building standards are maintained. A principle of our building regulations is that if you wish to use combustible materials on the exterior of tall buildings, the design of cladding system you are using should be subject to a fire test. Sector bodies did not uphold that principle. Soon after the Grenfell fire, Newsnight revealed how one of the entities that signs off buildings, supplying so-called ""Approved Inspectors"" to developers, had issued worrisome advice. Not just any body, either. The National House Building Council (NHBC), the very first entity outside local government to be given the authority to do building sign-off back in the 1980s. They announced last September that they would sign offa variety of combustible insulation boards combined with claddingwith a combustible core - and they stated that you did not need to do a test nor commission a study to use such combinations. NHBC themselves stated that ""this is on the basis of... having reviewed a significant quantity of data"". Some of these combinations have now been explicitly shown to be unsafe. Newsnight's reporting led them to withdraw their advice at the time, back in June, but their judgments about building safety must be called into question. On what basis did they introduce this sweeping guidance? Friends and relatives of victims of the Grenfell Tower fire joined local residents for a silent march to mark the second month since the disaster Exova Warringtonfire, one of the few longstanding fire engineering companies, also has questions to answer. They wrote reports which implied thatphenolic insulation could be used safely with FR-grade aluminium panels. They stated that you could use combustible insulation and combustible cladding. And this was not on the basis of conducting actual fire tests on the designs in question. Instead, Exova argued that the aluminium panels would behave, in a fire, in a similar way to ceramic tiles.  Thus, fire tests using ceramics could be used as a substitute for systems using aluminium cladding. When we first published this story, sector experts were shocked by Exova's judgment - which we now know to be flawed. We have asked both Exova Warringtonfire and the NHBC for comment on the evening of this publication - although the late hour of publication has made it difficult for them to respond. NHBC tonight simply stated that they will only sign off buildings using a reading of the rules that take ""the results of these tests into account"". Exova said their studies ""are based on the data available at the time and issued on the understanding that they are subject to review if further data becomes available"". The principles in our building regulations could be better drafted. But the bigger problem appears to be that institutions we expected to care about fire safety did not uphold the standards we demanded of them.

"The revelation was made on Fake or Fortune? presented by Philip Mould and Fiona Bruce An art dealer and TV presenter has spoken of his ""utter and raw delight"" on discovering a painting once deemed a fake was, in fact, worth Â£2m. Philip Mould was always convinced the painting was an original by British artist John Constable, but unable to produce proof, he sold it for Â£35,000. Now, 17 years later, he has been vindicated. Research by the BBC's Fake or Fortune? programme found it is an early version of Constable's famous Hay Wain. The presenter - more used to telling other people they had missed out on fortunes - had his own dealings put under the spotlight in Sunday's episode of the art detective show. Mr Mould told Radio 5 live he believed he had got hold of an original, when he paid Â£10,000 for the picture as a young dealer. ""I tried to prove it - but couldn't,"" he said of the depiction of Willy Lott's Cottage on the River Stour. So he sold it on, only to buy it back a few years later and try again to prove its authenticity. But still unable to, he sold it to British businessman Henry Reid in 2000. He paid Â£35,000, having ""believed [Mould's] conviction"" he would one day be able to prove its true worth. ""I promised the person I sold it to that one day I would return and try and prove it and wonderfully, we were able to do it,"" Mr Mould said. ""We have proved that a painting that I bought for a few thousand pounds originally, hoping it was a work by one of the greatest landscape painters who ever lived, is now finally proved to be so. I am so thrilled."" Earlier this year, 1821 painting The Hay Wain was voted one of the nation'sfavourite art works. John Constable's 1821 painting The Hay Wain The trail led Fake or Fortune? co-presenter Fiona Bruce to experts in Los Angeles. Mr Mould said the programme team examined the layers of paint and the work's provenance. ""Art history has moved on so magnificently - and technology - in the last 17 years. We can do things and find things out that were not possible when I was a youngster,"" he said. ""We were able to trace it back through various owners... right back pretty well to the brush of Constable himself. We found it in a sale sold by his son after his death which was a real slam dunker."" Presented with all the evidence, two specialists finally gave it ""the thumbs up"". Despite missing out on a multimillion-pound windfall, the dealer is not bitter. ""I'm enormously happy for him,"" he conceded. ""It's also wonderful for Constable himself.

When that request was refused, he staged his own poignant tribute.

"The victim was attacked at a bus stop in Cadogan Road, close to Cromer seafront A man has been arrested over the rape of a woman in Cromer, with police saying they are looking at links with disorder in the town on Saturday night. The teenage victim was attacked at a bus stop in Cadogan Road, near the seafront, late on Friday. On Saturday night, venues in the seaside town closed their doors due to thefts and anti-social behaviour. Norfolk Police said a man in his 30s had been detained in Essex on suspicion of rape. The force said new evidence meant it was exploring the possibility of links between the attack and disorder in Cromer over the weekend. Police previously said they were not linking the rape and the later trouble in the town. Cromer Pier's Theatre Bar was one of the venues to shut its doors On Saturday night, a BBC reporter was told by a taxi driver that ""travellers are rampaging the town"", and staff at The Wellington pub said they closed after a group of 30 travellers became ""rowdy"". The disorder, described by police as ""low level"", was linked by residents on social media to travellers who had arrived in the town on Friday. Cromer's Chamber of Trade and Business said companies lost ""thousands of pounds of trade"" Norfolk Police Deputy Chief Constable Nick Dean said earlier on Monday that officers were treating the weekend's disorder ""seriously"". He did not comment on who he thought was to blame for the disturbances and thefts, but said it would be ""totally disproportionate"" to blame the whole travelling community. North Norfolk District Council leader Tom FitzPatrick said the council served a notice on Saturday for the travellers to leave. 18 August: Police were called to five thefts, three from shops and two from local pubs where drinks were taken and not paid for. At about 23:30 BST, police were called to Cromer Social Club following reports a large group were there and refused to leave when asked. The group left when asked by police. 19 August: Police received reports of shoplifting and ""low-level"" anti-social behaviour in the Cromer area. At about 17:00, officers were called to a pub after a large group of people refused to leave. Officers arrived and the group left. Officers were called at about 19:15 after reports people had taken drinks from a restaurant on Prince of Wales Road without paying. Police attended and drinks were either paid for or returned. Shortly after 20:50 police were called to a private bar at a caravan park following reports a large group had entered and refused to leave when asked by the manager. Officers spoke to the group who then left. The local MP Norman Lamb says he was disturbed by the description of the disorder as ""low level"" by police and questioned the failure to arrest anyone. ""I want to meet with the chief constable to hear his account, to see why they described it as they did and also the way they responded,"" he said. Stallholders in Cromer told BBC Look East they felt intimidated as the travellers moved round the town looking for food and drink. Ice cream seller Lee Sales said: ""There may not be fights or anything like that but when it's intimidation creating fear - that's bad."" Laurie Scott said an employee from another cafe was shaking like a leaf when confronting hungry travellers Laurie Scott of Breakers CafÃ© said an employee from another cafe was confronted on the doorstep by a crowd who wanted to get in and get food. They were using foul language when entry was refused and the manager believed they had been drinking. ""He's a big, burly fellow like me and he faced them down but told me he was shaking like a leaf at the time. ""There's a lot of anger across the town that this was allowed to happen."" Ayrun Nessa suffered a bruise on her arm preventing a crowd of women getting into her restaurant Ayrun Nessa, wife of the owner of the Masala Twist restaurant, said bottles were flying around and she was left with a painful bruise on her arm trying to prevent the crowd getting in. She said she had been confronted at the door by six women shouting abuse. ""Cromer is normally a quiet and calm place with lovely people, but this was something else,"" she said.

"Johnson & Johnson said the safety of talc was supported by decades of scientific evidence Johnson & Johnson has been ordered to pay $417m (Â£323.4m)  to a woman who says she developed ovarian cancer after using products such as baby powder. The California jury's decision marks the largest award yet in a string of lawsuits that claim the firm did not adequately warn about cancer risks from talc-based products. A spokeswoman for Johnson & Johnson defended the products' safety. The firm plans to appeal, as it has in previous cases. ""We will appeal today's verdict because we are guided by the science,"" Carol Goodrich, spokesperson for Johnson & Johnson Consumer Inc, said in a statement. The evidence around any link between talc use and cancer is inconclusive. Blood tests spot ovarian cancer early Johnson & Johnson, headquartered in New Jersey, faces thousands of claims from women who say they developed cancer due to using the firm's products to address concerns about vaginal odour and moisture. Johnson & Johnson has lost four of five previous cases tried before juries in Missouri, which have led to more than $300m in penalties. The California lawsuit was brought by Eva Echeverria, a 63-year-old woman who said she started using baby powder when she was 11 years old. She was diagnosed with ovarian cancer 10 years ago; the diagnosis is terminal, according to lawyers working on the case. The lawsuit alleged that the company was aware of cancer risk associated with talcum powder, but concealed that information from the public. The verdict included $70m in compensatory damages and $347m in punitive damages. Analysis:James Gallagher, health editor, BBC news website Is talc safe? There have been concerns for years that using talcum powder, particularly on the genitals, may increase the risk of ovarian cancer. But the evidence is not conclusive. The International Agency for Research on Cancer classifies talc used on the genitals as ""possibly carcinogenic,external"" because of the mixed evidence. Why is there any debate? The mineral talc in its natural form does contain asbestos and does cause cancer, however, asbestos-free talc has been used in baby powder and other cosmetics since the 1970s. But the studies on asbestos-free talc give contradictory results. It has been linked to a cancer risk insome studies,external, but there are concerns that the research may be biased as they often rely on people remembering how much talc they used years ago. Other studies have argued there isno link at all,externalandthere is no link,externalbetween talc in contraceptives such as diaphragms and condoms (which would be close to the ovaries) and cancer. Also there does not seem to be a ""dose-response"" for talc, unlike with known carcinogens like tobacco where the more you smoke, the greater the risk of lung cancer. The charityOvacome,externalsays there is no definitive evidence and that the worst-case scenario is that using talc increases the risk of cancer by a third. But it adds: ""Ovarian cancer is a rare disease, and increasing a small risk by a third still gives a small risk. So even if talc does increase the risk slightly, very few women who use talc will ever get ovarian cancer.""

"Stephen Spence had to have his heart restarted 50 times A man who suffered 51 cardiac arrests in 10 days has made a ""remarkable recovery"", his cardiologist has said. Stephen Spence, 52, was taken to hospital after suffering the first cardiac arrest in his sleep. Mr Spence, from Burnley, said staff told him he was like ""a training aid"" as he needed so many shocks. He has since returned to work. Doctors say it is ""extremely rare"" for someone to suffer so many cardiac arrests over that timescale. Mr Spence's wife Kate said she first realised there were problems when she thought his snoring had woken her up, only to find he did not respond when she nudged and then shook him. ""I later discovered what I thought was snoring was actually him trying to breathe as he was having his cardiac arrest at the time,"" she added. Mr Spence's eldest son Josh, 22, was given instructions over the telephone by a 999 operator to carry out CPR on his dad while waiting for the ambulance to arrive. Stephen Spence had been ""healthy and well"" with ""no signs of heart problems"" before the cardiac arrests, his wife said Father-of-two Mr Spence needed shocks to restart his heart 50 times over the 10 days at Royal Blackburn Teaching Hospital after the first cardiac arrest on 9 December. Every time he was taken off life support he had another cardiac arrest. He gradually stabilised and had an operation to fit a mini defibrillator on his heart at Manchester's Wythenshawe Hospital to help him lead a normal life. Mrs Spence said her husband had been ""healthy and well"" with ""no signs of heart problems"". But during those 10 days he suffered ""all sorts of other complications because of the cardiac arrests"", including hypoxic brain injury caused by the lack of oxygen to the brain. A cardiac arrest is when a person's heart stops pumping blood around their body and they stop breathing normally. It is not the same as a heart attack, which is a sudden interruption to the blood supply to part of the heart muscle. Many cardiac arrests in adults happen because the person is having a heart attack. But there are many other causes, including extreme blood or fluid loss, extreme body temperature (too high or too low), a lack of oxygen, or most commonly an abnormal heart rhythm called ventricular fibrillation. Source:British Heart Foundation,external Dr Ravi Singh, from Royal Blackburn Hospital, said the ""sheer number of cardiac arrests over such a prolonged period of time is extremely rare"". Cardiac consultant Dr Singh said: ""I think it is remarkable that Stephen has made such a great recovery."" Mr Spence, who has just returned to work as an operations manager with a security company, said his memories of the time in critical care were hazy. He added: ""It is as if it all happened to someone else."" He now encourages people to seek medical advice for anything unusual, saying two weeks before his first cardiac arrest he thought he was suffering indigestion. Mr Spence added: ""I thought it was just heartburn or indigestion. Maybe if I'd gone to the doctors at that stage, things might not have got as serious as they did."" A spokesman for the British Heart Foundation said what happened to Mr Spence was ""very unusual but not completely unheard of"".

"This video can not be played The timing of this incident is awkward for the United States The US Navy has ordered a worldwide ""operational pause"" of its fleet after a destroyer collided with a tanker near Singapore, leaving 10 sailors missing. Five other sailors were injured in the crash involving the guided missile destroyer USS John S McCain. Officials are also conducting a ""comprehensive review"" of the Pacific fleet following Monday's incident. It was the fourth crash involving a US Navy ship in a year, and the second in the past two months. Navy Adm John Richardson, the chief of naval operations,said in a statement,external: ""This trend demands more forceful action. ""As such, I have directed an operational pause be taken in all of our fleets around the world."" The pause, which will be staggered across the fleets, will last one to two days and could begin within a week, he later told reporters. The operational pause and review of the Pacific fleet - which the USS John S McCain belongs to - are in addition to a separate ongoing investigation into the latest incident. The USS John S McCain was sailing east of Singapore when the collision with the Liberian-flagged vessel occurred. It was reported before dawn at 05:24 local time on Monday (21:24 GMT on Sunday) and took place east of the Strait of Singapore, as the American vessel went for a routine port stop in Singapore. The destroyer sustained damage to her port side, which is the left-hand side of the vessel facing forward. Crew berthing, machinery and communications rooms were flooded, the Navy said The tanker it collided with, Alnic MC, sustained damage to a tank near the front of the ship 7m (23ft) above the waterline, but none of its crew was injured and there were no oil spills. At 182m (600ft), the tanker is slightly longer than the 154m-long US destroyer. US military helicopters as well as the Singaporean and Malaysian navies and coast guards are conducting search and rescue operations. A Singapore Air Force helicopter transports wounded to hospital Malaysian Navy chief Admiral Kamarulzaman said a message had been sent to fishing vessels along the Johor and Pahang coasts to keep a look out. A Malaysian Navy spokesman later told a news conference: ""The waves are between 0.5m and 1.5m, so the sea is quite rough and can be very challenging if you don't have a life jacket."" TheUS Navy said,externalfour of the injured sailors had non-life threatening injuries and were medically evacuated to a Singapore hospital. The fifth person did not require further medical attention. The US Navy 7th Fleetlater issued a statement,externalsaying the USS John S McCain had arrived at Singapore's Changi naval base. A picture of the Alnic MC tweeted by Malaysia's navy chief The Alnic MC made its way to the Raffles Reserved Anchorage in Singapore. One crew member of the oil tanker told Reuters over the phone that the vessel sustained some damage to a valve. The ship was carrying nearly 12,000 tonnes of oil from Taiwan to Singapore, the news agency reported. The Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore said: ""There is no report of oil pollution and traffic in the Singapore Strait is unaffected."" Two serious collisions with merchant vessels; some 17 crew members dead or missing; and two guided missile destroyers of the US Seventh Fleet out of action for months - good reason then for a thorough review. But are these unconnected episodes or part of a broader systemic failure? This is what the new review will have to find out. Analysts and former officers note the high tempo of operations. The US Navy - despite its size -  is just not large enough, they say, to do everything that is asked of it. Training inevitably suffers. And the dramatic growth in merchant shipping - the real measure of our globalised world - means the sea-lanes are now more crowded than ever. For years the US Navy has had no obvious peer competitor. And some fear that it may be losing its edge. US Senator John McCain tweeted that he and his wife were praying for the sailors. The vessel was named after his father and grandfather, both admirals in the Navy. ""I agree with Admiral Richardson that more forceful action is urgently needed to identify and correct the causes of the recent ship collisions,"" he added. Allow Twitter content?

This is the fourth time in a year that a US navy vessel has been involved in an accident. Just two months ago, seven US sailors were killed when the USS Fitzgerald collided with a container ship in Japanese waters near the port city of Yokosuka. In pictures: USS Fitzgerald crash Those who died were found in flooded berths on board the ship after the collision caused a gash under the warship's waterline.

"This video can not be played Watch: The US witnesses the 'diamond ring' effect A total solar eclipse has wowed the US. A huge shadow cast by the Moon as it passed in front of the Sun swept across the nation, from Oregon in the west to South Carolina in the east. Millions of people moved to get into the path of darkness, putting on their protective glasses to gaze at the sky in wonder. It was the firsttotal solar eclipse,externalvisible from America's lower 48 states in 38 years, and the first since 1918 to track from coast to coast. As it happened: American eclipse The view from above the Pacific Ocean When is the next eclipse in my country? Why are eclipses so rare? Meet the man addicted to eclipses Those who went to Carbondale were not disappointed US President Donald Trump and First Lady Melania Trump saw a partial eclipse in Washington DC The spectacle got under way in earnest in Oregon at 10:16 local time (17:16 GMT; 18:16 BST). Skywatchers gathered at coastal beaches and towns witnessed the Sun's disc being completely obscured by the Moon for two minutes. But just before and just after ""totality"", they also got to see some of the classic features of a full solar eclipse. These included ""Baily's beads"" which arise as the last shafts of sunlight drive through valleys on the Moon; and the ""Diamond Ring"", which is the single brilliant point of light that signals the beginning and end of totality. From Oregon, the eclipse shadow raced on through Idaho, Montana, Wyoming, Nebraska, Kansas, Iowa, Missouri, Illinois, Kentucky, Tennessee, Georgia, North Carolina, and South Carolina. It was a journey that took roughly 90 minutes. Using a ""pinhole camera"" was the safest way to view the Sun and Moon action Space station astronaut Paolo Nespoli pictured the Moon's shadow from orbit Small towns along the path were inundated with visitors. So were the National Parks. In Carbondale, Illinois, city authorities billed their locality as the ""Eclipse Crossroads of America"" because it would enjoy totality both on Monday and when the next US eclipse occurs in 2024. As anticipated, Carbondale proved to be a huge magnet to skywatchers who made good use of the more than 60,000 extra car parking spaces organised for the day. The area also had the privilege of enjoying the longest period of darkness anywhere in the country at just over two minutes and 40 seconds. The Atlantic coastal city of Charleston was the place tasked with saying goodbye to the eclipse. Beachgoers experienced the full shadow at 14:48 local time (18:48 GMT; 19:48 BST). Although, the US had exclusive rights on totality, a partial eclipse was visible across all of North America, reaching beyond the Canadian Arctic; as well as across the north of South America down to Bolivia. In Washington DC, President Donald Trump, First Lady Melania Trump and their son, Barron, made sure they had protective glasses as they looked skyward. The Moon's shadow (dark spot) leaves the US - as pictured by Europe's Meteosat Parts of western Europe were also set to see the Moon take a chunk out of the Sun at the end of the day just before the star dipped below the horizon. It was just a small bite, but in parts of France and the Canary Islands where clouds were limited - it was no less of a spectacle. For those outside the path of the Moon's shadow or smothered by poor weather, there was always the internet. The US space agency (Nasa) streamed pictures from many vantage points including from a series of helium-filled balloons. Some of the most spectacular shots of the day came from orbit. Italian astronaut Paolo Nespoli looked down on the moving shadow from the International Space Station. And from their ""stationary"" positions some 36,000km above the planet, meteorological satellites also returned some stunning imagery. The next total solar eclipse on Earth is on2 July, 2019,external, over the South Pacific, Chile, Argentina.

"Grimsby Town supporters claimed the searches were ""a gross invasion of privacy"" Female football fans were asked to show their bras to stewards during security searches, a supporters' group has said. Grimsby Town fan group the Mariners Trust made the allegation in a letter to Stevenage FC after the two sides met on Saturday. It said some fans wearing underwired bras were also asked by stewards at the Lamex Stadium if they could feel them. Stevenage FC said its risk assessment found ""high-risk groups attending and potential for anti-social behaviour"". More on this and other Grimsby stories The stewarding plan for the match was ""not typical"" of those at Stevenage, it said. The club said after liaising with Grimsby Town's safety officer and the police it was thought prohibited items were likely to be brought into the ground and could be passed on to those ""deemed less likely to be searched, such as women and younger supporters"". No incidents were recorded on the day of ""inappropriate behaviour"" towards female supporters or young spectators, it said. However the club would study CCTV footage and investigate to see infringements of procedures had not taken place, it added. The checks, carried out by female stewards, but which the supporters' trust said were ""in full view of male stewards, fans and police"", have been described as ""a gross invasion of privacy"". Theletter from the supporters' group,externalalleges stewards asked some female fans ""if they could feel their bras"" if they told them their bras were underwired. The group says children as young as five were subjected to full body searches and supporters had items that were not listed as being banned confiscated, such as ""contact lens solution, cough sweets and medication"". The letter also said a female steward was posted inside a male toilet, adding: ""The steward was asked to leave by Grimsby Town supporters, but she refused despite the fact several male stewards and police officers were stood outside."" Paul Savage, board member of the Mariners Trust, told the BBC he had been among 800 supporters queuing to enter the ground. He said the woman who were asked by stewards to show their bras ranged in age between ""mid-30s to 70-year-olds"".  He added the women declined the request. ""They were all shocked and because of the nature of the request, they were stunned and until they got into the ground, they didn't know what to do and say, ""he said. ""It was only later on when we got word about what had happened that we tried to take it further."" Stevenage 3-1 Grimsby Town The Mariners Trust described the treatment of supporters as ""amongst the worst our fans have experienced in decades of travelling across the world to watch football."" The letter concludes by calling on Stevenage FC to address the ""serious failings"" as a ""matter of urgency... to ensure no other visiting team's supporters are treated as animals in the way your club did on Saturday The English Football League said it ""had been made aware of the contents"" of the supporters' letter and a statement by Stevenage FC. ""The EFL's security advisor is looking further into the matters raised and will be seeking the observations of both clubs."" The league would not make any further comment until all the facts had been ""fully considered"", it said. Hertfordshire Police said it had not been contacted by supporters, but any complaints would be would ""fully investigated"". The force said its officers were at the ground ""due to intelligence regarding a previous game between Chesterfield and Grimsby Town, where there was public disorder and members of the public were injured"". It added none of its officers were involved in any of the searches ""which were carried out by stewards"".

"RocÃ­o CortÃ©s NÃºÃ±ez, a mother of three, died at a Seville hospital soon after giving birth to her third child A Spanish woman has died after being crushed in a freak accident involving a hospital lift, local media report. RocÃ­o CortÃ©s NÃºÃ±ez, 25, had just given birth by Caesarian section in Seville's Our Lady of Valme hospital when the incident occurred on Sunday. Her hospital trolley was being wheeled out of the lift when it began to rise with its doors open, leaving part of her body hanging outside. Firefighters were called to rescue her but she could not be saved. Some reports say her head was severed. Ms NÃºÃ±ez had two other children, aged four and five, and her newborn daughter - who was with her at the time - was not harmed. Her brother-in-law David Gaspar said that the family wanted to know why safety systems appeared to have failed. He added the accident was hard to believe. Ms NÃºÃ±ez's husband, JosÃ© Gaspar, said he was devastated by what had happened. ""This can't be so. Today it was RocÃ­o but tomorrow it could be someone else,"" he told ABC Sevilla. Regional health minister Marina Alvarez has opened an investigation but told reporters that the lift had passed safety tests earlier this month. She called it a ""rapid, unusual and tragic"" accident. A porter was reportedly moving Ms NÃºÃ±ez to a maternity ward when the doors on the lift they were in opened and closed a few times. But as he attempted to wheel her out of the lift to try another one, it began to rise, trapping her.

"A witness near a petrol station tipped off police Police have shot dead the main suspect in last Thursday's Barcelona attack, Younes Abouyaaqoub. They believe he was the driver of a van which careered down the Las Ramblas avenue, killing 13 and injuring more than 100 others. He was killed some 25 miles (40km) west of Barcelona near a sewage treatment works following a tip off. Abouyaaqoub, wearing a fake explosive belt, is reported to have shouted  ""Allahu Akbar"" (""God is Greatest""). An extensive manhunt was already under way when police closed in on the Subirats area, close to Sant SadurnÃ­ d'Anoia. A petrol station employee spotted Abouyaaqoub and called the police who found him hiding in vineyards. After he was shot, bomb disposal officers used a robot to examine the fake explosive belt. This led to some delay before Moroccan-born Abouyaaqoub could be officially identified. Local residents described seeing some 20 police cars heading for the scene and helicopters circling. Police said the investigation was still international in scope. At an earlier news conference, police described Abouyaaqoub's escape from the scene of the Barcelona attack on foot to the outskirts of the city where he hijacked a car and stabbed its driver. CCTV footage in Spanish media appears to show him walking through a market district. The man murdered in the car was named as Pau PÃ©rez, 34, from Vilafranca - the 15th victim of the Barcelona bloodshed and a later attack in the resort of Cambrils. A woman died in Cambrils when a car was driven into pedestrians and five suspected jihadists were killed at the scene by police early on Friday. Spain attacks: What we know so far Who are the Barcelona suspects? In pictures: Barcelona van attack Swimmer sacrifices race for terror victims Police have also confirmed that an imam, suspected of radicalising the young men who carried out the attacks, died in what is believed to have been an accidental explosion on Wednesday at a house in Alcanar, south of Barcelona, that was being used as a bomb factory. The remains of one other person found at the house are still being examined. The terror cell behind the attacks was 12 strong. Police say eight suspects are now dead and four are in custody. The group had apparently been planning three co-ordinated attacks using home-made bombs, but were thwarted by the Alcanar blast. Police found about 120 gas canisters at the Alcanar site. Who were the victims? Barcelona attack: What the trees say Family members of the dead suspects said they believed Imam Es Satty had radicalised several young people in their home town of Ripoll, north of Barcelona. Spanish media outlets say he had spent some time in prison, and had met prisoners involved or linked with the 2004 Madrid train bombings in which 191 people died. He had also stayed in Belgium for some three months last year, where he had been searching for work, including in Vilvoorde, a small town of 42,000 people from which more than 20 jihadists departed for Syria in 2014. An official who works on de-radicalisation in Belgium has told the BBC that Es Satty tried to secure a post at a mosque near Brussels but the elders decided he should not be allowed to preach due to his ""radicalised and polarising"" approach. The mosque asked police to perform a background security check but this did not throw up any specific areas of concern.

"Brighton fans say they were abused throughout much of the game on Saturday Supporters of both clubs have condemned homophobic abuse after anti-gay chanting was heard during Leicester's match against Brighton. Two Foxes fans were arrested during their team's2-0 home win over the Seagullson Saturday. Brighton Supporters Club's vice chair said such chanting was ""disgusting"" and the club should be fined and anyone responsible banned from the stadium. The chairman of Foxes Pride said abuse was ""offensive"" and ""unacceptable"". Live updates from the East Midlands Brighton are new to the Premier League but say they are experiencing the same problems with homophobia Brighton is a city well known forhaving a substantial lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) community. Liz Costa from Brighton & Hove Albion Supporters Club said about 50 Leicester fans took part in the ""disgusting"" chanting throughout most of the match at the King Power Stadium. She said: ""The club needs fining, this has nothing to do with football. ""[The chanting] lets the whole club down and damages their reputation. I feel I never want to visit [the stadium] again. ""Those responsible need to be identified and banned."" Shinji Okazaki made it two goals in two games She added that Leicester's stewards were ""very good"" and reacted quickly. Graeme Smith from Foxes Pride said: ""There are some forums where people are saying you need to get over it, you need to get a life, it's only a bit of banter, but its not, it's offensive and it's unacceptable."" Leicester fan Chris Whiting, who is gay, said the ""shocking"" chanting by his fellow supporters made him feel unsafe. Kick It Out said there could be sanctions against clubs if homophobic chanting carries on Both the Football Association and the Premier League have been approached for comment. Paul Mortimer from anti-discrimination group Kick It Out said: ""It's about education more than anything, making people aware of the impact that this has on their own fans. ""Within football clubs there are LGBT communities and imagine what they will be feeling when a section of fans are saying this horrible language in their presence."" Leicester City said it was ""disappointed"" about what happened but satisfied stewards reacted ""swiftly and appropriately"" and those responsible were ejected and reported to police. A 44-year-old man has been charged with indecent chanting under Section 3 of theFootball Offences Act,externaland is due to appear at Leicester Magistrates' Court on Thursday. A second man aged 21 who was arrested on suspicion of making obscene gestures was given a caution.

"Ricafort Gamboa had been driving friends home following a caravan holiday A driver has been jailed for causing a crash which killed his friend as he tried to reach 100mph to film footage for Snapchat. Ricafort Gamboa, 25, from Bolton, raced along country roads near Aberystwyth, while friends inside his car filmed him on their mobile phones. But his Citroen C3 smashed into a wall, killing Ernest Pideli, 18  and injuring two others, Swansea Crown Court heard. Gamboa admitted causing death and serious injury by dangerous driving. He was jailed for four years after telling police: ""I take full responsibility for what happened. My stupid decision to drive so fast was the cause of the collision. ""I deserve to be punished. I am deeply sorry for what happened."" Paul Hobson, prosecuting, told the court the group had been returning to Manchester after a holiday at a caravan site in Fishguard, Pembrokeshire. Gamboa's friends could be heard on mobile phones recovered from the crashed car encouraging him to drive faster and he began taking corners on the wrong side of the road. Gamboa, a Filipino with British status, was recorded saying, ""I am going fast. I will go faster."" But as he raced downhill into a series of corners, the car fishtailed, mounted a bank and then swerved across the road and into a cottage on the side of the A487 at Chancery, a few miles south of Aberystwyth. A 16in (41cm) thick stone wall was demolished by the car, which had been doing more than 90mph. Mr Pideli, who had been a talented footballer and had been hoping to return to his native Philippines, died four days later from head and neck injuries. Gamboa's barrister, Charles Row, said he was so remorseful, he was being genuine when he said he wished he had died and not his friend. The cottage which the car crashed into Judge Keith Thomas told Gamboa, who wept as he was being sentenced, that he had used the road as a racetrack. ""You drove at breakneck speed saying you were trying to reach 100mph,"" he said. ""And you ignored signs telling you to slow down and that there were bends ahead. ""Your friend was only 18 and had his whole life in front of him. You have caused incalculable loss to his family."" Gamboa, a Domino's Pizza restaurant shift manager, was also banned from driving for five years.

"A witness near a petrol station tipped off police Police have shot dead the main suspect in last Thursday's Barcelona attack, Younes Abouyaaqoub. They believe he was the driver of a van which careered down the Las Ramblas avenue, killing 13 and injuring more than 100 others. He was killed some 25 miles (40km) west of Barcelona near a sewage treatment works following a tip off. Abouyaaqoub, wearing a fake explosive belt, is reported to have shouted  ""Allahu Akbar"" (""God is Greatest""). An extensive manhunt was already under way when police closed in on the Subirats area, close to Sant SadurnÃ­ d'Anoia. A petrol station employee spotted Abouyaaqoub and called the police who found him hiding in vineyards. After he was shot, bomb disposal officers used a robot to examine the fake explosive belt. This led to some delay before Moroccan-born Abouyaaqoub could be officially identified. Local residents described seeing some 20 police cars heading for the scene and helicopters circling. Police said the investigation was still international in scope. At an earlier news conference, police described Abouyaaqoub's escape from the scene of the Barcelona attack on foot to the outskirts of the city where he hijacked a car and stabbed its driver. CCTV footage in Spanish media appears to show him walking through a market district. The man murdered in the car was named as Pau PÃ©rez, 34, from Vilafranca - the 15th victim of the Barcelona bloodshed and a later attack in the resort of Cambrils. A woman died in Cambrils when a car was driven into pedestrians and five suspected jihadists were killed at the scene by police early on Friday. Spain attacks: What we know so far Who are the Barcelona suspects? In pictures: Barcelona van attack Swimmer sacrifices race for terror victims Police have also confirmed that an imam, suspected of radicalising the young men who carried out the attacks, died in what is believed to have been an accidental explosion on Wednesday at a house in Alcanar, south of Barcelona, that was being used as a bomb factory. The remains of one other person found at the house are still being examined. The terror cell behind the attacks was 12 strong. Police say eight suspects are now dead and four are in custody. The group had apparently been planning three co-ordinated attacks using home-made bombs, but were thwarted by the Alcanar blast. Police found about 120 gas canisters at the Alcanar site. Who were the victims? Barcelona attack: What the trees say Family members of the dead suspects said they believed Imam Es Satty had radicalised several young people in their home town of Ripoll, north of Barcelona. Spanish media outlets say he had spent some time in prison, and had met prisoners involved or linked with the 2004 Madrid train bombings in which 191 people died. He had also stayed in Belgium for some three months last year, where he had been searching for work, including in Vilvoorde, a small town of 42,000 people from which more than 20 jihadists departed for Syria in 2014. An official who works on de-radicalisation in Belgium has told the BBC that Es Satty tried to secure a post at a mosque near Brussels but the elders decided he should not be allowed to preach due to his ""radicalised and polarising"" approach. The mosque asked police to perform a background security check but this did not throw up any specific areas of concern.

"Michael Ashworth was arrested as he tried to board a Eurotunnel shuttle to the UK A man who absconded from prison 22 years ago is back behind bars after being arrested in France. Michael John Ashworth, 57, was held in Coquelles on Sunday while trying to board a Eurotunnel shuttle to the UK. He absconded from HMP Sudbury in Derbyshire in 1995 during a five-year sentence for drugs offences and had been living in Holland. Medway magistrates said Ashworth, who was arrested by Kent Police officers, must serve the rest of his sentence. He had been accused of escaping from lawful custody, but the case was withdrawn by magistrates who heard he was on temporary licence and should not have been charged with the offence. Police had said he absconded in 1995 from HMP Sudbury and failed to return having been released on temporary licence. Ashworth said he had told police he wanted to hand himself in.

"This video can not be played Watch: The US witnesses the 'diamond ring' effect A total solar eclipse has wowed the US. A huge shadow cast by the Moon as it passed in front of the Sun swept across the nation, from Oregon in the west to South Carolina in the east. Millions of people moved to get into the path of darkness, putting on their protective glasses to gaze at the sky in wonder. It was the firsttotal solar eclipse,externalvisible from America's lower 48 states in 38 years, and the first since 1918 to track from coast to coast. As it happened: American eclipse The view from above the Pacific Ocean When is the next eclipse in my country? Why are eclipses so rare? Meet the man addicted to eclipses Those who went to Carbondale were not disappointed US President Donald Trump and First Lady Melania Trump saw a partial eclipse in Washington DC The spectacle got under way in earnest in Oregon at 10:16 local time (17:16 GMT; 18:16 BST). Skywatchers gathered at coastal beaches and towns witnessed the Sun's disc being completely obscured by the Moon for two minutes. But just before and just after ""totality"", they also got to see some of the classic features of a full solar eclipse. These included ""Baily's beads"" which arise as the last shafts of sunlight drive through valleys on the Moon; and the ""Diamond Ring"", which is the single brilliant point of light that signals the beginning and end of totality. From Oregon, the eclipse shadow raced on through Idaho, Montana, Wyoming, Nebraska, Kansas, Iowa, Missouri, Illinois, Kentucky, Tennessee, Georgia, North Carolina, and South Carolina. It was a journey that took roughly 90 minutes. Using a ""pinhole camera"" was the safest way to view the Sun and Moon action Space station astronaut Paolo Nespoli pictured the Moon's shadow from orbit Small towns along the path were inundated with visitors. So were the National Parks. In Carbondale, Illinois, city authorities billed their locality as the ""Eclipse Crossroads of America"" because it would enjoy totality both on Monday and when the next US eclipse occurs in 2024. As anticipated, Carbondale proved to be a huge magnet to skywatchers who made good use of the more than 60,000 extra car parking spaces organised for the day. The area also had the privilege of enjoying the longest period of darkness anywhere in the country at just over two minutes and 40 seconds. The Atlantic coastal city of Charleston was the place tasked with saying goodbye to the eclipse. Beachgoers experienced the full shadow at 14:48 local time (18:48 GMT; 19:48 BST). Although, the US had exclusive rights on totality, a partial eclipse was visible across all of North America, reaching beyond the Canadian Arctic; as well as across the north of South America down to Bolivia. In Washington DC, President Donald Trump, First Lady Melania Trump and their son, Barron, made sure they had protective glasses as they looked skyward. The Moon's shadow (dark spot) leaves the US - as pictured by Europe's Meteosat Parts of western Europe were also set to see the Moon take a chunk out of the Sun at the end of the day just before the star dipped below the horizon. It was just a small bite, but in parts of France and the Canary Islands where clouds were limited - it was no less of a spectacle. For those outside the path of the Moon's shadow or smothered by poor weather, there was always the internet. The US space agency (Nasa) streamed pictures from many vantage points including from a series of helium-filled balloons. Some of the most spectacular shots of the day came from orbit. Italian astronaut Paolo Nespoli looked down on the moving shadow from the International Space Station. And from their ""stationary"" positions some 36,000km above the planet, meteorological satellites also returned some stunning imagery. The next total solar eclipse on Earth is on2 July, 2019,external, over the South Pacific, Chile, Argentina.

"The chief suspect in last Thursday's Barcelona attack made his escape on foot to the outskirts of the city where he hijacked a car, Spanish police say. At a news briefing, they confirmed that Younes Abouyaaqoub, 22, was suspected of driving the van which ploughed into dozens of people, killing 13. CCTV footage in Spanish media appears to show him walking through a market district shortly after the attack. A manhunt has been extended across Europe and police say he may be armed. Some 90 minutes after mowing down dozens of people on the central Las Ramblas avenue, Abouyaaqoub fled to the city's university district, police say. Abouyaaqoub is alleged to have hijacked the car before driving it through a police checkpoint and later abandoning the vehicle. Police say he may have crossed into France. The male driver of the car, Pau PÃ©rez, 34, from Vila Franca, was found stabbed to death in the back seat, becoming the 15th victim of the Barcelona bloodshed and a later attack in the resort of Cambrils. A woman died in Cambrils when a car was driven into pedestrians, and five suspected jihadists were killed at the scene by police. At a news conference on Monday, officials also revealed there were ""strong indications"" that an imam suspected of radicalising the young men who carried out the attacks had died in an explosion at a house in Alcanar, south of Barcelona, that was being used as a bomb factory. Images published by El Pais show Abouyaaqoub walking through La Boqueria market, wearing sunglasses, as he passes other people heading away from Las Ramblas. Police also released more images of Abouyaaqoub, and appealed for help in finding him.

"This video can not be played The former England rugby player tells 5 live that having Lyme Disease was ""seriously debilitating"" When former England rugby player Matt Dawson was bitten by a tick in a London park early last year, it caused a bacterial infection to spread through his body. ""I had two days where I felt awful. Very feverish, on the sofa, crashed out,"" he said. Eventually he went to hospital where he was diagnosed with Lyme disease: ""It was a really scary time for me and my family. Such a tiny creature caused me to end up needing heart surgery."" Lyme disease is a bacterial infection, passed on to humans by infected ticks. While it is difficult to estimate the total number of UK cases, they are understood to have increased more than fourfold in the past 10 years. The peak season is April to October, though they are active all year round. A distinctive rash called erythema migrans often develops after the tick bite In around two-thirds of cases, a distinctive rash called erythema migrans will develop in the days to weeks that follow the tick bite It is often shaped like a bullseye, but not in all cases, and some individuals will have several rather than one Flu-like symptoms are another strong indicator of Lyme disease Facial palsy is common in children Others may experience tingling or numbness in parts of the body and, rarely, severe headaches If you get these symptoms and have also been bitten by a tick - or been out in a tick hotspot - then it is worth talking to your doctor If left untreated, early localised Lyme can attack the nervous system and cause debilitating neurological problems However, if you receive prompt antibiotic treatment, it can successfully treat the disease and prevent further illness Source: BBC Trust me I'm a Doctor A World Cup winner in 2003, Dawson played 77 times for England and made seven appearances for the British and Irish Lions. Matt said he was floored by his diagnosis: ""I'd heard of Lyme disease before. It was something I'd always associated with places abroad, on the continent, in America, wherever there were deer. ""There's no way that I would've walked through a wood or a forest with my kids and gone back home and thought, 'right, I'll just check for some ticks just to make sure everything is fine'. I just wouldn't have thought of that."" Ticks can be found in areas with deep or overgrown vegetation. They're common in woodland and heath areas, but can also be found in gardens or parks. People who hike and camp in such places are at risk of getting bitten. Ticks don't jump or fly, but climb on to your clothes or skin if you brush against something they're on. They then bite into the skin and start to feed on your blood. It's thought only a small proportion of ticks carry the bacteria that cause Lyme disease, so being bitten doesn't mean you'll definitely be infected. Pets can also bring ticks home in their fur. Source:NHS Choices,external Matt Dawson has now joined forces withThe Big Tick Project,,externalwhich looks to raise awareness about the dangers of ticks and tick-borne disease in the UK. Tied to researchers at University of Bristol, the project has conductedthe largest ever study of ticks in dogs.They studied 14,000 dogs from 1,400 vets across the UK and found almost one-third were carrying a tick. TV presenter and naturalist Chris Packham is working with the project to raise awareness among pet owners and vets: ""It is really important that pet owners understand how they can treat their pets for ticks and reduce the risk of the further spread of these horrible, debilitating and potentially dangerous diseases to the UK,"" he said. After multiple heart operations and 18 months of treatment, Matt no longer has the disease. But it still affects his life:  ""I'm still on medication and its going to take a lot of time for the heart to fully recover. ""This is not something that should be looked at like, 'oh it's only a tick, a tick is a bit like a flea, its fine!',"" he said. ""These ticks carry some really quite potent, serious bacteria and they can cause you a lot of problems. Raising awareness of them is imperative.""

"This video can not be played The timing of this incident is awkward for the United States Ten US Navy sailors are missing and five have been injured after a US destroyer and an oil tanker collided near Singapore, the Navy says. The guided missile destroyer USS John S McCain was sailing east of Singapore and preparing to stop in the port when the collision with the Liberian-flagged vessel occurred. A wide-ranging search and rescue operation is under way. It is the second collision involving a US Navy ship in recent months. It was reported before dawn at 05:24 local time on Monday (21:24 GMT on Sunday) and took place east of the Strait of Singapore, as the USS John S McCain prepared to perform a routine port stop in Singapore. Singapore and US authorities said the destroyer sustained damage to her port side, which is the left-hand side of the vessel facing forward. Crew berthing, machinery and communications rooms were flooded, the Navy said The tanker it collided with, Alnic MC, sustained damage to a tank near the front of the ship 7m (23ft) above the waterline, but none of its crew were injured and there were no oil spills. At 182m (600ft), the tanker is slightly longer than the 154m-long US destroyer. US military helicopters as well as the Singaporean and Malaysian navies and coast guards are currently conducting search and rescue operations. A Singapore Air Force helicopter transports wounded to hospital Malaysian Navy chief Admiral Kamarulzaman said a message had been sent to fishing vessels along the Johor and Pahang coasts to keep a look out for missing sailors. A Malaysian Navy spokesman later told a news conference: ""The waves are between 0.5m and 1.5m, so the sea is quite rough and can be very challenging if you don't have a life jacket."" TheUS Navy said,externalfour of the injured sailors had non-life threatening injuries and were medically evacuated to a Singapore hospital. The fifth person did not require further medical attention. The US Navy 7th Fleetlater issued a statement,externalsaying the USS John S McCain had now arrived at Singapore's Changi naval base. It said: ""Significant damage to the hull resulted in flooding to nearby compartments, including crew berthing, machinery, and communications rooms. Damage control efforts by the crew halted further flooding."" A picture of the Alnic MC tweeted by Malaysia's navy chief The Alnic MC is making its way to the Raffles Reserved Anchorage in Singapore. One crew member of the oil tanker told Reuters over the phone that the vessel sustained some damage to a valve. The ship was carrying nearly 12,000 tonnes of oil from Taiwan to Singapore, the news agency reported. The Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore said: ""There is no report of oil pollution and traffic in the Singapore Strait is unaffected."" Karishma Vaswani, BBC News, Singapore The timing of this is awkward for the United States. It's the first day ofannual drillsbetween the US and South Korean armies, a show of might in the face of North Korean belligerence. The USS John McCain is part of the US Navy's 7th Fleet, its largest fleet, but this accident will add to questions about the operations of the navy in the region more widely. This is the same naval group that saw a similar accident only in June, when seven US sailors lost their lives. Just last week several officers were disciplined in relation to that incident. This is also thought to be the fourth such collision involving US warships in the past year alone. Add to this the confusion earlier this year over the whereabouts of another US warship in the Pacific - the USS Carl Vinson - which President Trump said was sailing for North Korea, but was actually headed in the opposite direction for training exercises with the Australian navy. Shortly after news of the collision came out, the US chief of naval operations, John Richardson, tweeted that the first priority was to determine the safety of the ship and the crew. US senator John McCain tweeted that he and his wife were praying for the sailors. The vessel was named after his father and grandfather, both admirals in the Navy. Allow Twitter content?

"Kim Wall boarded Peter Madsen's submarine Nautilus on 10 August, and then disappeared A Danish inventor charged over the death of Swedish journalist Kim Wall has said she died in an accident on his submarine and he ""buried"" her at sea, Copenhagen police say. The court case is being heard behind closed doors but Peter Madsen's explanation of what happened was released after a request from the defence and prosecution. Ms Wall was last seen on Mr Madsen's submarine on the night of 10 August. The search for her body continues. In a statement, Copenhagen police also said that maritime authorities had determined the route the submarine travelled in Koge Bay and the Oresund strait before sinking. Mr Madsen, 46, claims that he left her body somewhere in Koge Bay, south of Copenhagen, the police said. A search effort involving divers, helicopters and ships has been under way along the identified route since Friday. The Danish inventor has been charged with negligent manslaughter. The police say they cannot release any more information at this time. Kim Wall: What we know and what we don't Who is DIY submariner Peter Madsen? Peter Madsen's lawyer, Betina Hald Engmark, said her client had not admitted any wrongdoing. She said he had given evidence to the police during preliminary questioning and ""information from this"" had now emerged. ""My client has not confessed to anything, my client still pleads not guilty to the charges against him,"" she said. Police believe Mr Madsen deliberately sank the submarine Ms Wall, a 30-year-old journalist who wrote for several international publications, was first reported missing by her boyfriend after she failed to return from what should have been a short trip on the UC3 Nautilus submarine. She had been researching a feature about Mr Madsen and his 40-tonne submarine, which at one stage was the largest privately-made vessel of its kind. Police believe the submarine was deliberately sunk by Mr Madsen, who was rescued before being arrested. Mr Madsen initially said he dropped Ms Wall off after dark on 10 August, close to where they had met earlier. But police later said he had given them a new account of events, which was not made public at the time.

"Grimsby Town supporters claimed the searches were ""a gross invasion of privacy"" Female football fans were asked to show their bras to stewards during security searches, a supporters' group has said. Grimsby Town fan group the Mariners Trust made the allegation in a letter to Stevenage FC after the two sides met on Saturday. It said some fans wearing underwired bras were also asked by stewards at the Lamex Stadium if they could feel them. Stevenage FC said its risk assessment found ""high-risk groups attending and potential for anti-social behaviour"". More on this and other Grimsby stories The stewarding plan for the match was ""not typical"" of those at Stevenage, it said. The club said after liaising with Grimsby Town's safety officer and the police it was thought prohibited items were likely to be brought into the ground and could be passed on to those ""deemed less likely to be searched, such as women and younger supporters"". No incidents were recorded on the day of ""inappropriate behaviour"" towards female supporters or young spectators, it said. However the club would study CCTV footage and investigate to see infringements of procedures had not taken place, it added. The checks, carried out by female stewards, but which the supporters' trust said were ""in full view of male stewards, fans and police"", have been described as ""a gross invasion of privacy"". Theletter from the supporters' group,externalalleges stewards asked some female fans ""if they could feel their bras"" if they told them their bras were underwired. The group says children as young as five were subjected to full body searches and supporters had items that were not listed as being banned confiscated, such as ""contact lens solution, cough sweets and medication"". The letter also said a female steward was posted inside a male toilet, adding: ""The steward was asked to leave by Grimsby Town supporters, but she refused despite the fact several male stewards and police officers were stood outside."" Paul Savage, board member of the Mariners Trust, told the BBC he had been among 800 supporters queuing to enter the ground. He said the woman who were asked by stewards to show their bras ranged in age between ""mid-30s to 70-year-olds"".  He added the women declined the request. ""They were all shocked and because of the nature of the request, they were stunned and until they got into the ground, they didn't know what to do and say, ""he said. ""It was only later on when we got word about what had happened that we tried to take it further."" Stevenage 3-1 Grimsby Town The Mariners Trust described the treatment of supporters as ""amongst the worst our fans have experienced in decades of travelling across the world to watch football."" The letter concludes by calling on Stevenage FC to address the ""serious failings"" as a ""matter of urgency... to ensure no other visiting team's supporters are treated as animals in the way your club did on Saturday The English Football League said it ""had been made aware of the contents"" of the supporters' letter and a statement by Stevenage FC. ""The EFL's security advisor is looking further into the matters raised and will be seeking the observations of both clubs."" The league would not make any further comment until all the facts had been ""fully considered"", it said. Hertfordshire Police said it had not been contacted by supporters, but any complaints would be would ""fully investigated"". The force said its officers were at the ground ""due to intelligence regarding a previous game between Chesterfield and Grimsby Town, where there was public disorder and members of the public were injured"". It added none of its officers were involved in any of the searches ""which were carried out by stewards"".

"The chief suspect in last Thursday's Barcelona attack made his escape on foot to the outskirts of the city where he hijacked a car, Spanish police say. At a news briefing, they confirmed that Younes Abouyaaqoub, 22, was suspected of driving the van which ploughed into dozens of people, killing 13. CCTV footage in Spanish media appears to show him walking through a market district shortly after the attack. A manhunt has been extended across Europe and police say he may be armed. Some 90 minutes after mowing down dozens of people on the central Las Ramblas avenue, Abouyaaqoub fled to the city's university district, police say. Abouyaaqoub is alleged to have hijacked the car before driving it through a police checkpoint and later abandoning the vehicle. Police say he may have crossed into France. The male driver of the car, Pau PÃ©rez, 34, from Vila Franca, was found stabbed to death in the back seat, becoming the 15th victim of the Barcelona bloodshed and a later attack in the resort of Cambrils. A woman died in Cambrils when a car was driven into pedestrians, and five suspected jihadists were killed at the scene by police. At a news conference on Monday, officials also revealed there were ""strong indications"" that an imam suspected of radicalising the young men who carried out the attacks had died in an explosion at a house in Alcanar, south of Barcelona, that was being used as a bomb factory. Images published by El Pais show Abouyaaqoub walking through La Boqueria market, wearing sunglasses, as he passes other people heading away from Las Ramblas. Police also released more images of Abouyaaqoub, and appealed for help in finding him. Spain attacks: What we know so far In pictures: Barcelona van attack Swimmer sacrifices race for terror victims Catalan officials said on Monday that all 15 victims had now been identified and their families notified. Tributes to the victims, including Italians, are in evidence along Las Ramblas Police believe that Abouyaaqoub is the only one of the 12 suspects at large. In addition to the five killed in Cambrils, four others are under arrest. Two sets of human remains are yet to be identified from the house that blew up in Alcanar last Wednesday night. Who were the victims? Barcelona attack: What the trees say Family members of the dead suspects said they believed Imam Es Satty had radicalised several young people in their home town of Ripoll, north of Barcelona. Spanish media outlets say Es Satty had spent some time in prison, and had met prisoners involved or linked with the 2004 Madrid train bombings in which 191 people died. He had also stayed in Belgium for some three months last year, where he had been searching for work, including in Vilvoorde, a small town of just 42,000 from which more than 20 jihadists departed for Syria in 2014. An official who works on de-radicalisation in Belgium has told the BBC that Es Satty tried to secure a post at a mosque near Brussels but the elders decided he should not be allowed to preach due to his ""radicalised and polarising"" approach. The mosque asked police to perform a background security check but this did not throw up any specific areas of concern. This video can not be played Inside the pretty town hiding terror suspects El Mundo said,externalthat one of those killed in Cambrils, Said Aallaa, had left a note in his room apologising for the harm he was about to cause. The group had apparently been planning three co-ordinated attacks using home-made bombs. Police found about 120 gas canisters at the Alcanar site. Spain attacks: 'It was very frightening' Spain's long anti-terror experience French media also report that the vehicle used in the Cambrils attack had been caught on speed cameras in France's Essonne region the previous week. But a direct link between the group of attackers in Spain and the car's appearance in France has not yet been established. So-called Islamic State (IS) said it had carried out the Las Ramblas and Cambrils attacks, though it is not clear whether any of the attackers were directly connected to the group or simply inspired by it.

The driver has been arrested. His vehicle had struck another bus shelter in a different district of the city earlier in the morning, seriously injuring one person. French prosecutors say the case is not being treated as a terrorist incident. French media reports say the driver is known to police and may have mental health issues. The unconfirmed reports say he has a criminal record but is not known to the intelligence services. The first bus stop was hit at about 09:15 (07:15 GMT) at Croix Rouge in the 13th district, where one person was seriously hurt. The second bus stop was struck at about 10:00 at Valentine in the 11th district. French media say the woman who died was in her 40s.

"The UK government has set out proposals to ensure trade in goods and services can continue on the day the UK leaves the EU in March 2019. A position paper,externalcalls for goods already on the market to be allowed to remain on sale in the UK and EU without additional restrictions. It also calls for consumer protections to remain in place. The Brexit department aims to keep pressure on the EU ahead of the third round of talks in Brussels next week. A second paper,externalcalling for a reciprocal agreement to ensure continued confidentiality for official documents shared by Britain with its EU partners while it was a member state has also been published on Monday. A guide to the Brexit negotiations UK proposes 'untested' customs model with EU Further papers are due in the coming days, including one on the crucial issue of the European Court of Justice - a sticking point in talks. Brussels is refusing to discuss future arrangements, such as trade, until citizens' rights, the UK's ""divorce bill"" and the Northern Ireland border have been settled. EU leaders reiterated their stance last week as the UK published proposals about new customs arrangements. Mr Davis said the latest batch of publications would ""drive the talks forward"" and ""show beyond doubt"" that enough progress had been made to move to the next stage of talks. David Davis said: ""These papers will help give businesses and consumers certainty and confidence in the UK's status as an economic powerhouse after we have left the EU. ""They also show that as we enter the third round of negotiations, it is clear that our separation from the EU and future relationship are inextricably linked. ""We have already begun to set out what we would like to see from a future relationship on issues such as customs and are ready to begin a formal dialogue on this and other issues."" David Davis is eager to start trade talks But European Commission spokesman Alexander Winterstein said the UK's position papers would not alter the framework for talks drawn up by chief negotiator Michel Barnier and approved by the other 27 EU member states. ""There is a very clear structure in place, set by the EU27, about how these talks should be sequenced and that is exactly what we think should be happening now,"" Mr Winterstein told a Brussels press conference. ""So the fact that these papers are coming out is, as such, welcome because we see this as a positive step towards now really starting the process of negotiations. ""But as Michel Barnier has said time and again, we have to have sufficient progress first on the three areas of citizens' rights, financial settlement and Ireland, and only then can we move forwards to discussing the future relationship."" He added: ""Hopefully we can make fast progress on the three areas I have mentioned because once we have reached sufficient progress there, we can move on to the second stage."" A Downing Street spokesman said: ""Both sides need to adopt a flexible approach. We are working at pace. We are confident we will make sufficient progress. ""David Davis has said we want to move to the next stage in October."" Monday's publications urge the EU to widen its ""narrow"" definition of the availability of goods on the market to also include services, arguing this is the only way to protect consumers and businesses trading before Brexit. The goods and services paper calls for: Guarantees that goods on sale before exit day, in March 2019, can continue to be sold in the UK and EU, without any additional requirements or restrictions Products that have been authorised for sale in the EU, such as approval for a certain model of a car, should remain valid in both markets after exit UK consumer protection watchdogs should continue to have access to information about unsafe products, such as medicines and food, and ""mechanisms to take action with respect to non-compliant goods"" Business group the CBI described Mr Davis's position on trade as a ""significant improvement"" on EU proposals which would create a ""severe cliff-edge"" for goods currently on the market. But CBI campaigns director John Foster said: ""The only way to provide companies with the reassurance they need is through the urgent agreement of interim arrangements. ""This would ensure that goods and services can still flow freely, giving companies the certainty they need to invest. ""The simplest way to achieve that is for the UK to stay in the single market and a customs union until a comprehensive new deal is in force."" The most contentious of the week's publications is expected to be about ""enforcement and dispute resolution"", as it tackles the question of the UK's future relationship with the European Court of Justice. Theresa May has promised the UK will leave the jurisdiction of the EU court, with the government saying Parliament will ""take back control"" of its laws. But the EU has insisted the ECJ must have a role in enforcing citizens' rights, and how to enforce any future trade deal has yet to be agreed. Other papers expected this week will look at how to maintain the exchange of data with other European countries and future ""co-operation"" between the different legal systems.

"Two hundred years ago, it was still possible for one person to be a leader in several different fields of inquiry. Today that is no longer the case. So is there a role in today's world for the polymath - someone who knows a lot about a lot of things? ""The winner of the 1964 Nobel Prize winner in chemistry, which British X-Ray crystallographer was instrumental inâ¦"" ""Man produces evil as a bee produces honey.  These are the words of which Nobel laureate, born in Cornwall in 1911, his novels include Pincher Martin, the Inheritors and Rites ofâ¦"" Obviously you don't need to hear the rest of these questions to know the answers.  At least, not if you're Eric Monkman or Bobby Seagull. Seagull's fist-pumping and natty dressing, and Monkman's furrowed brow, flashing teeth, contorted facial expressions and vocal delivery - like a fog horn with a hangover - made these two young men the stars of the lastUniversity Challengecompetition. ""Wolfson, Monkman"" and ""Emmanuel, Seagull"" became familiar phrases, Monkmania became a hashtag. They squared off as opposing captains in the semi-finals (though in the final itself, the team from Balliol College, Oxford triumphed). At Cambridge, Monkman and Seagull forged a most unlikely friendship. The Canadian, Eric Monkman, is the middle-class son of two doctors. Bobby Seagull's family originate in Kerala, India, and he was raised in a working-class part of east London, before gaining a scholarship to Britain's most elite private school, Eton. ""If I got married tomorrow, I'd ask Eric to be my best man,"" says Seagull. Listen to Monkman and Seagull's Polymathic Adventure on BBC Radio 4 at 20:30 on Monday 21 August Catch up later on the BBC iPlayer They're still recognised in the street. ""People often ask me, do you intimidate people with your knowledge,"" says Monkman. ""But the opposite is the case.  I have wide knowledge but no deep expertise.  I am intimidated by experts.""  Seagull, like Monkman, feels an intense pressure to specialise.  They regard themselves as Jacks-of-all-Trades, without being master of one. ""When I was young what I really wanted to do was know a lot about a lot,"" says Monkman. ""Now I feel that if I want to make a novel contribution to society I need to know a great deal about one tiny thing."" The belief that researchers need to specialise goes back at least two centuries. From the beginning of the 19th Century, research has primarily been the preserve of universities. Ever since, says Stefan Collini, Professor of Intellectual History and English Literature at Cambridge University, researchers have labels attached to them. ""They're professor of this or that, and you get a much more self-conscious sense of the institutional divides between domains of knowledge."" Before then, there were some polymaths who made original contributions in multiple areas. The word polymath stems from the Greek,polus, meaning ""much"" or ""many"" andmathe, meaning ""learning"". The first use of the word has been traced to the 17th Century.  From the Renaissance, people such as  Leonardo da Vinci - painter, sculptor, architect, physicist, anatomist, philosopher, geologist and biologist - gave rise to a synonym of polymath, the ""Renaissance man"". Leonardo da Vinci designed an aeroplane and a helicopter-like ""helical air screw"" One polymath/Renaissance Man was Thomas Young (1773-1829), the subject of a biography by Andrew Robinson entitled The Last Man Who Knew Everything. Young was a physician and physicist, whose achievements were breathtaking. He established the wave theory of light, undertook pioneering work in optics and studied 400 languages, helped decode the hieroglyphs on the Rosetta Stone - and much, much more.  And to confound any notion that he was a sort of 19th Century uber-geek, he was also an accomplished dancer and gymnast. These days, any ambition to contribute to many disciplines is probably unrealistic. It takes years of immersion just to reach the boundary of our current knowledge in any one area. Today's polymaths might share the same personal qualities as Thomas Young - an abundance of grey matter, of course, combined with relentless curiosity and a tendency to workaholicism (Young barely slept) - but they are repositories of scholarship rather than contributors to it. Eric's choice: Stephen Leacock(1869-1944): Anglo-Canadian political scientist and economist famous in Canada today for his collections of humorous essays and stories. The subjects of his comedy include academia, mathematics, life in rural Canada and the ""leisure classes"" described by his mentor Thorstein Veblen. When browsing a bookshelf in Canada, I always hope to find an early Stephen Leacock collection. Joseph Needham(1900-1995): British biochemist, sinologist and historian. As a biochemist, Needham studied chemical embryology. As a sinologist, he was one of the first Westerners to realise the depth of Chinese accomplishments in science. This led him to pose the ""Needham Question"", asking why modern science arose in Europe but not in China. I find this an intriguing mystery. Bobby's choice: Hildegard of Bingen(1098-1179): This German Benedictine abbess was a theologian, writer, poet, composer, artist, linguist, medical researcher and botanist. She is regarded as the founder of scientific natural history in Germany and is one of the first historically identifiable composers in Western music. I was taught about her during my years at St Bonaventure's Catholic secondary school. Rabindranath Tagore(1861-1941): The Calcutta-born ""Bard of Bengal"" was the first non-European to win the Nobel Prize for Literature (1913). India chose one of his musical compositions for its national anthem, while Bangladesh chose one of his poems. He was also a painter, and founded the renowned Visva-Bharati University. My father, who studied Bengali literature at university, introduced me to Tagore at a young age. So is there still a useful role for today's clever-clog - besides ringer in the pub quiz team? Stefan Collini says that in many Western societies ""there is a populist hostility to expertise in public life"".  It may be that polymaths, with their broader gaze, have an important role in communicating specialist fields. What's more, with ever narrowing specialism there is a need for generalists to synthesise information, to make connections between the discipline silos. A contemporary polymath, the American academic Jared Diamond, drew on his interest in geography, evolution, anthropology, history and botany, to develop a theory explaining how it was that Eurasian and North African civilisations came to conquer others. It was turned into a best-selling book, Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies. Jared Diamond: One of Stephen Fry's favourite polymaths Diamond is one of Stephen Fry's favourite polymaths. Fry - actor, comedian, writer and general egghead - is himself on the polymathic spectrum. He says he shares a personality trait with other polymaths - inquisitiveness. ""If you know a lot, it's because you're curious,"" he says. ""You have this impulse to know and, therefore, things stick to you. You put on, as it were, epistemological weight. I have always been fantastically greedy to know things."" Monkman and Seagull love knowing a lot of stuff. You might find them reading about the French Revolution one day, and about genetics or astronomy the next. Despite their anxiety about spreading themselves too thin, they share Fry's appetite to know. It's an overwhelming craving, likely to frustrate any countervailing drive to master one topic. By the way. The answer to those two questions. Dorothy Hodgkin was the crystallographer, and William Golding the novelist. But you knew that anyway.

"Experts have warned that ""lethal autonomous"" technology could be hacked More than 100 leading robotics experts are urging the United Nations to take action in order to prevent the development of ""killer robots"". In a letter to the organisation, artificial intelligence (AI) leaders, including billionaire Elon Musk, warn of ""a third revolution in warfare"". Theletter,externalsays ""lethal autonomous"" technology is a ""Pandora's box"", adding that time is of the essence. The 116 experts are calling for a ban on the use of AI in managing weaponry. ""Once developed, they will permit armed conflict to be fought at a scale greater than ever, and at timescales faster than humans can comprehend,"" the letter says. ""These can be weapons of terror, weapons that despots and terrorists use against innocent populations, and weapons hacked to behave in undesirable ways,"" it adds. There is an urgent tone to the message from the technology leaders, who warn that ""we do not have long to act"". ""Once this Pandora's box is opened, it will be hard to close."" Warning against AI arms race Soldiers that never sleep AI fighter pilot wins in combat Experts are calling for what they describe as ""morally wrong"" technology to be added to the list of weapons banned under the UN Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons (CCW). Along with Tesla co-founder and chief executive Mr Musk, the technology leaders include Mustafa Suleyman, Google's DeepMind co-founder. A UN group focusing on autonomous weaponry was scheduled to meet on Monday but the meeting has been postponed until November, according to the group's website. A potential ban on the development of ""killer robot"" technology has previously been discussed by UN committees. In 2015, more than 1,000 tech experts, scientists and researcherswrote a letterwarning about the dangers of autonomous weaponry. Among the signatories of the 2015 letter were scientist Stephen Hawking, Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak and Mr Musk. A killer robot is a fully autonomous weapon that can select and engage targets without human intervention. They do not currently exist but advances in technology are bringing them closer to reality. Those in favour of killer robots believe the current laws of war may be sufficient to address any problems that might emerge if they are ever deployed, arguing that a moratorium, not an outright ban, should be called if this is not the case. However, those who oppose their use believe they are a threat to humanity and any autonomous ""kill functions"" should be banned.

"A fire-damaged tumble dryer More people will die from fires started by faulty white goods if ministers do not act to implement recommendations, the London Fire Brigade, the city's mayor, and safety groups have warned. In a letter to Theresa May,external, they say some fridges and freezers are being sold with a flammable plastic backing. People continue to use products that are subject to recalls, it adds. The warning comes a year after a tower block fire in west London, started by a faulty tumble dryer. The letter refers tothe fire from August 2016 in Shepherds Court, which began in a Indesit dryer. Despite taking 120 firefighters to bring the blaze under control, no one was injured in the fire. But the incident prompted a series of safety recommendations, which, the letter says one year on, have not been acted on. The government is due to respond later this year. Are our home appliances safe? The letter says: ""A year on, people across the UK are still using white goods that pose a serious fire risk and are subject to recall or corrective action. ""Worse still, some fridges and freezers are still being produced with a flammable plastic backing, which offers very little protection against the insulation foam inside catching alight if a fire starts."" At least 120 firefighters tackled the blaze in Shepherd's Court, west London Chantal Froelich lives in Shepherds Court and was made homeless by the fire for more than three months. "" I can't believe it's a year on and these machines still haven't been recalled,"" she told the Victoria Derbyshire programme. ""People are dying in these fires and we were just really lucky it wasn't one of us."" There have been 2,170 fires in London involving white goods since 2010, the fire brigade said. It wants the government to put a single register of product recalls, including all international recalls, on its website. It also wants risk assessments to be published when a fault is identified and for the ""sleeping risk"" to be included in these assessments. The letter was signed by the London Fire Brigade Commissioner Dany Cotton, London Mayor Sadiq Khan, the Fire Brigades Union, the National Fire Chiefs Council and the charity Electrical Safety First. The Grenfell Tower fire started in a faulty fridge-freezer The letter says other fire recommendations have not yet been implemented. In 2014, a coroner suggested a series of safety recommendations to improve product recalls, following theinquest of Santosh Benjamin-Muthiah, a father who died saving his wife and children from a fire caused by a fridge-freezer. The fire service said it was ""extremely concerned"" that ""no substantial changes"" have been made in the product recall system since then. Mr Khan said the government's delay in implementing the LFB's recommendations was ""inexcusable"". ""The terrible tragedy at Grenfell Tower in June is a stark reminder of just how devastating a fire caused by faulty white goods can be,"" he said. The Grenfell Tower fire, which killed 80 people, started in a Hotpoint fridge-freezer. The product hasnot been recalled,external. Consumer Minister Margot James said the government already has a ""robust system"" to inform people  of faulty goods. She said: ""Our one-stop shopProduct Recall website,externalmakes it clear to the public which white goods are safe to use at home and we are considering the framework for a national body to support consumers on product safety.""

French prosecutors say the case is not being treated as a terrorist incident. French media reports say the driver is known to police and may have mental health issues. The unconfirmed reports say he has a criminal record but is not known to the intelligence services.

"The chief suspect in last Thursday's Barcelona attack made his escape on foot to the outskirts of the city where he hijacked a car, Spanish police say. At a news briefing, they confirmed that Younes Abouyaaqoub, 22, was suspected of driving the van which ploughed into dozens of people, killing 13. CCTV footage in Spanish media appears to show him walking through a market district shortly after the attack. A manhunt has been extended across Europe and police say he may be armed. Some 90 minutes after mowing down dozens of people on the central Las Ramblas avenue, Abouyaaqoub fled to the city's university district, police say. Abouyaaqoub is alleged to have hijacked the car before driving it through a police checkpoint and later abandoning the vehicle. Police say he may have crossed into France. The male driver of the car, Pau PÃ©rez, 34, from Vila Franca, was found stabbed to death in the back seat, becoming the 15th victim of the Barcelona bloodshed and a later attack in the resort of Cambrils. A woman died in Cambrils when a car was driven into pedestrians, and five suspected jihadists were killed at the scene by police. At a news conference on Monday, officials also revealed there were ""strong indications"" that an imam suspected of radicalising the young men who carried out the attacks had died in an explosion at a house in Alcanar, south of Barcelona, that was being used as a bomb factory. Images published by El Pais show Abouyaaqoub walking through La Boqueria market, wearing sunglasses, as he passes other people heading away from Las Ramblas. Police also released more images of Abouyaaqoub, and appealed for help in finding him. Spain attacks: What we know so far In pictures: Barcelona van attack Swimmer sacrifices race for terror victims Catalan officials said on Monday that all 15 victims had now been identified and their families notified. Tributes to the victims, including Italians, are in evidence along Las Ramblas Police believe that Abouyaaqoub is the only one of the 12 suspects at large. In addition to the five killed in Cambrils, four others are under arrest. Two sets of human remains are yet to be identified from the house that blew up in Alcanar last Wednesday night. Who were the victims? Barcelona attack: What the trees say Family members of the dead suspects said they believed Imam Es Satty had radicalised several young people in their home town of Ripoll, north of Barcelona. Spanish media outlets say Es Satty had spent some time in prison, and had met prisoners involved or linked with the 2004 Madrid train bombings in which 191 people died. He had also stayed in Belgium for some three months last year, where he had been searching for work, including in Vilvoorde, a small town of just 42,000 from which more than 20 jihadists departed for Syria in 2014. An official who works on de-radicalisation in Belgium has told the BBC that Es Satty tried to secure a post at a mosque near Brussels but the elders decided he should not be allowed to preach due to his ""radicalised and polarising"" approach. The mosque asked police to perform a background security check but this did not throw up any specific areas of concern. This video can not be played Inside the pretty town hiding terror suspects El Mundo said,externalthat one of those killed in Cambrils, Said Aallaa, had left a note in his room apologising for the harm he was about to cause. The group had apparently been planning three co-ordinated attacks using home-made bombs. Police found about 120 gas canisters at the Alcanar site. Spain attacks: 'It was very frightening' Spain's long anti-terror experience French media also report that the vehicle used in the Cambrils attack had been caught on speed cameras in France's Essonne region the previous week. But a direct link between the group of attackers in Spain and the car's appearance in France has not yet been established. So-called Islamic State (IS) said it had carried out the Las Ramblas and Cambrils attacks, though it is not clear whether any of the attackers were directly connected to the group or simply inspired by it.

"Up to 1.8 million Scottish votes were ""wasted"" in June's general election because they had no impact on the result, a study claims. The Electoral Reform Society found 66.4% of votes did not go towards electing an MP under Westminster's first-past-the-post (FPTP) system. It said there had been a ""sea of wasted votes and a surge in tactical voting"". It added it was time for a proportional system for Westminster elections, similar to the one used at Holyrood. Under the FPTP system, Labour won 27% of the votes cast in Scotland but got just 12% of the seats, while the SNP won 37% of the votes cast but returned almost 60% of the seats, according to the ERS research. In its report, the society argued Scotland was ""shifting back to multi-party politics"". It pointed out that 21 of the 59 Scottish seats changed party in this year's general election - more in relative terms than any other region or nation in the UK. But it warned Scotland was at risk of witnessing a ""lottery election"", with slim victories meaning many seats hinged on just a handful of votes. It called for Westminster to adopt a more proportional voting system, such as Scotland's Single Transferable Vote (STV) used in local elections. Source: Electoral Reform Society report Electoral Reform Society Scotland director Willie Sullivan, said: ""Electors should be able to vote for parties they agree with on the broad sweep of policy, instead of feeling the need to vote tactically based on one significant issue such as independence or Brexit because they fear 'winner takes all' dominance. ""A proportional system would allow for this, create a much broader discussion of politics ensure all votes are of equal value with citizens feeling empowered to take part."" Mr Sullivan also argued there were relatively few ""stable waymarks"" in the current political landscape. He said: ""Shock changes can take place very quickly and are exaggerated by the electoral system. ""Victories are precarious, and the possibility of another election in the medium term could mean all-change again soon. ""Large swings, often local in effect, show that no party can expect very long in the sun. ""Banff and Buchan where a majority of over 14,000 for the SNP turned into a majority for the Conservative party of 3,600 highlights this."" He added: ""Scotland returned four of the UK's top 10 smallest majorities. Those MPs' bottoms rest on very wobbly seats.""

"The chief suspect in last Thursday's Barcelona attack made his escape on foot to the outskirts of the city where he hijacked a car, Spanish police say. At a news briefing, they confirmed that Younes Abouyaaqoub, 22, was suspected of driving the van which ploughed into dozens of people, killing 13. CCTV footage in Spanish media appears to show him walking through a market district shortly after the attack. A manhunt has been extended across Europe and police say he may be armed. Some 90 minutes after mowing down dozens of people on the central Las Ramblas avenue, Abouyaaqoub fled to the city's university district, police say. Abouyaaqoub is alleged to have hijacked the car before driving it through a police checkpoint and later abandoning the vehicle. Police say he may have crossed into France. The male driver of the car, Pau PÃ©rez, 34, from Vila Franca, was found stabbed to death in the back seat, becoming the 15th victim of the Barcelona bloodshed and a later attack in the resort of Cambrils. A woman died in Cambrils when a car was driven into pedestrians, and five suspected jihadists were killed at the scene by police. At a news conference on Monday, officials also revealed there were ""strong indications"" that an imam suspected of radicalising the young men who carried out the attacks had died in an explosion at a house in Alcanar, south of Barcelona, that was being used as a bomb factory. Images published by El Pais show Abouyaaqoub walking through La Boqueria market, wearing sunglasses, as he passes other people heading away from Las Ramblas. Police also released more images of Abouyaaqoub, and appealed for help in finding him. Spain attacks: What we know so far In pictures: Barcelona van attack Swimmer sacrifices race for terror victims Catalan officials said on Monday that all 15 victims had now been identified and their families notified. Tributes to the victims, including Italians, are in evidence along Las Ramblas Police believe that Abouyaaqoub is the only one of the 12 suspects at large. In addition to the five killed in Cambrils, four others are under arrest. Two sets of human remains are yet to be identified from the house that blew up in Alcanar last Wednesday night. Who were the victims? Barcelona attack: What the trees say Family members of the dead suspects said they believed Imam Es Satty had radicalised several young people in their home town of Ripoll, north of Barcelona. Spanish media outlets say Es Satty had spent some time in prison, and had met prisoners involved or linked with the 2004 Madrid train bombings in which 191 people died. He had also stayed in Belgium for some three months last year, where he had been searching for work, including in Vilvoorde, a small town of just 42,000 from which more than 20 jihadists departed for Syria in 2014. An official who works on de-radicalisation in Belgium has told the BBC that Es Satty tried to secure a post at a mosque near Brussels but the elders decided he should not be allowed to preach due to his ""radicalised and polarising"" approach. The mosque asked police to perform a background security check but this did not throw up any specific areas of concern. This video can not be played Inside the pretty town hiding terror suspects El Mundo said,externalthat one of those killed in Cambrils, Said Aallaa, had left a note in his room apologising for the harm he was about to cause. The group had apparently been planning three co-ordinated attacks using home-made bombs. Police found about 120 gas canisters at the Alcanar site. Spain attacks: 'It was very frightening' Spain's long anti-terror experience French media also report that the vehicle used in the Cambrils attack had been caught on speed cameras in France's Essonne region the previous week. But a direct link between the group of attackers in Spain and the car's appearance in France has not yet been established. So-called Islamic State (IS) said it had carried out the Las Ramblas and Cambrils attacks, though it is not clear whether any of the attackers were directly connected to the group or simply inspired by it.

The collision, which was reported at 05:24 local time on Monday (21:24 GMT on Sunday), happened as the USS John McCain prepared to perform a routine port stop in Singapore. Initial reports indicated that the ship had ""sustained damage"" to its port side, but the US Navy said it was now sailing under its own power and heading to Singapore's port. US military helicopters as well as Singapore's navy and coast guard are conducting search and rescue efforts. Malaysia has also joined in the rescue effort.

"This video can not be played Troops in the South Korean city of Goyang take part in a drill to free hostages The US and South Korea are conducting annual military drills which consistently infuriate Pyongyang, despite appeals to halt the exercise. Last week North Korea appeared to back down from a threat to send missiles towards the US Pacific island of Guam, but said it would watch US actions. It has already condemned these drills as pouring ""gasoline on fire"". Washington describes the drills as defensive in nature, but the North sees them as preparation for invasion. China and Russia had in July proposed a halt on military exercises in exchange for a freeze on missile tests. But Joseph Dunford, chairman of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff, said last week that the military exercises were ""not currently on the table as part of the negotiation at any level"" and the Ulchi-Freedom Guardian (UFG) exercises were going ahead as planned. About 17,500 US troops and 50,000 South Korean troops are involved in the exercises, which will last for about 10 days. After North Korea's threats against Guam and an almost unprecedented war of words over Pyongyang's repeated missile tests, analysts have warned that the joint drills may be seen as a provocation at a particularly sensitive time. On Sunday an editorial in North Korea's official government newspaper, the Rodong Sinmun, said the exercises would worsen the state of the peninsula and warned of an ""uncontrollable phase of a nuclear war"". What does Kim Jong-un really want? What could North Korea do? The crisis in 300 words South Korea's President Moon Jae-in responded on Monday that Pyongyang should not use the exercises ""as a pretext for aggravating the situation"", reported Yonhap news agency. The drills have also been met with some opposition in South Korea, where protests were held on Monday. This video can not be played Observers have been watching the north and south watch each other for more than 60 years. The US and South Korea hold two sets of war games every year, involving a massive number of troops and military hardware. Foal Eagle/Key Resolve is usually held in spring, while Ulchi-Freedom Guardian (UFG) is in autumn. Both involve land, sea and air military drills and computer simulations. Held in South Korea, they have also involved practice drills for terror and chemical attacks in recent years. Foal Eagle, held earlier this year, saw US and South Korean troops practice a beach landing They can also sometimes involve troops from other allies - last year's UFG saw the participation of nine other countries. Both events routinely anger North Korea, which insists that the exercises are rehearsals for an invasion. The country's media rhetoric over the drills has steadily intensified over the past three years and these exercises are being portrayed as a particularly strong provocation, BBC Monitoring reports. In 2014 North Korean media warned of an arms race but used comparatively restrained language, saying Pyongyang's ""self-defensive measures"" - its nuclear and missile testing - would become ""annual and regular"" as long as the exercises continued. The next year, state-run Rodong Sinmun newspaper warned that the drills represented ""deliberate defiance against our active efforts to ease tension"". And in 2016, state-run paper Minju Joson warned that North Korea would ""constantly strengthen our self-defensive nuclear deterrent"" in response. Within weeks, Pyongyang tested a nuclear warhead. Last year's UFG saw an anti-terror drill in Seoul simulating a subway chemical attack This year, Sunday's Rodong Sinmun said the situation on the Korean peninsula was a ""touch-and-go crisis that has never been experienced before"". Earlier this year during Foal Eagle/Key Resolve, it warned it would ""mercilessly foil the nuclear war racket of the aggressors with its treasured nuclear sword of justice"". But while it has frequently threatened serious retaliation, North Korea usually ends up conducting shows of force, such as firing missiles or moving troops. Last week, in what was seen as a de-escalation, leader Kim Jong-un said he would watch ""a little more"" before launching missiles in the direction of Guam. Medical evacuations are also practiced during the exercises Depending on the political climate, the drills have at times exacerbated tensions between the two sides. The UFG drill in 2015 took place amid high tensions, which resulted in North and South Korea exchanging artillery fire across the border. Military officials took the unusual step of halting the UFG whileemergency talks were heldbetween the North and South. The drill resumed several days later. The US and South Korea say that the exercises are purely for defence purposes, and based out of a mutual defence agreement they signed in 1953. They also say the exercises are necessary to strengthen their readiness in case of an external attack. Watching the North watching the South.

"Queen Elizabeth Hospital Birmingham is among the NHS hospitals calling for business rates relief as it faces a rise of more than Â£2m NHS trusts are calling for equal treatment on business rates after research revealed private hospitals get discounts worth Â£52m over five years. A study suggests more than one in four private hospitals are charities, giving them an 80% rebate in business rates. But NHS trusts all have to pay in full, and will face a Â£300m increase in rates over the next five years. University Hospitals Birmingham Trust, the worst hit, is appealing against a rate rise of more than Â£2m this year. A spokesman for the trust, which operates the Queen Elizabeth Hospital, said: ""The trust believes there is an anomaly in how NHS trusts are treated for business rates when compared to other organisations such as universities, charitable care facilities and private hospitals. ""NHS Trusts receive no additional funding to offset business rates costs. ""We are therefore, alongside other NHS trusts, part of a long-running challenge to seek a similar level of charitable relief on business rates, similar to non-profit organisations."" Research using Freedom of Information Act requests by CVS, a property valuation company, suggests that about 27% of private hospitals receive business rates relief. Local authorities reported that 123 out of 457 private hospitals were charities, allowing them the 80% rates reduction. No information was provided for a further 169 private hospitals in England and Wales. CVS calculates that the 626 private hospitals would have been expected to pay a total of Â£241.4m between them. But accounting for the institutions that are known to receive the discount for charities, the company expects them to save Â£51.9m. Nuffield Health, whose income makes it Britain's third largest charity, is expected to pay just Â£3.2m over the next five years, saving Â£12.7m because of its charitable status, according to the CVS analysis. Mark Rigby, chief executive of CVS, said: ""It is iniquitous that NHS hospitals pay normal business rates but 26.9% of private hospitals, using charitable status, receive an 80% discount."" While the government has announced plans to reform business rates, Mr Rigby said ""this must include all reliefs and the current inequalities that exist within the system"". Dozens of NHS hospitals wrote to local authorities last year to try to claim the reduced business rates, but the Local Government Association rejected the claim, as they are not charities in law. The revaluation of business rates, which came into effect in April, has increased NHS hospitals' tax bill by 19% to Â£366m a year.

"This video can not be played The timing of this incident is awkward for the United States Ten US Navy sailors are missing and five have been injured after a US destroyer and an oil tanker collided near Singapore, the Navy says. The guided missile destroyer USS John S McCain was sailing east of Singapore and preparing to stop in the port when the collision with the Liberian-flagged vessel occurred. A wide-ranging search and rescue operation is under way. It is the second collision involving a US Navy ship in recent months. It was reported before dawn at 05:24 local time on Monday (21:24 GMT on Sunday) and took place east of the Strait of Singapore, as the USS John S McCain prepared to perform a routine port stop in Singapore. Singapore and US authorities said the destroyer sustained damage to her port side, which is the left-hand side of the vessel facing forward. Crew berthing, machinery and communications rooms were flooded, the Navy said The tanker it collided with, Alnic MC, sustained damage to a tank near the front of the ship 7m (23ft) above the waterline, but none of its crew were injured and there were no oil spills. At 182m (600ft), the tanker is slightly longer than the 154m-long US destroyer. US military helicopters as well as the Singaporean and Malaysian navies and coast guards are currently conducting search and rescue operations. A Singapore Air Force helicopter transports wounded to hospital Malaysian Navy chief Admiral Kamarulzaman said a message had been sent to fishing vessels along the Johor and Pahang coasts to keep a look out for missing sailors. A Malaysian Navy spokesman later told a news conference: ""The waves are between 0.5m and 1.5m, so the sea is quite rough and can be very challenging if you don't have a life jacket."" TheUS Navy said,externalfour of the injured sailors had non-life threatening injuries and were medically evacuated to a Singapore hospital. The fifth person did not require further medical attention. The US Navy 7th Fleetlater issued a statement,externalsaying the USS John S McCain had now arrived at Singapore's Changi naval base. It said: ""Significant damage to the hull resulted in flooding to nearby compartments, including crew berthing, machinery, and communications rooms. Damage control efforts by the crew halted further flooding."" A picture of the Alnic MC tweeted by Malaysia's navy chief The Alnic MC is making its way to the Raffles Reserved Anchorage in Singapore. One crew member of the oil tanker told Reuters over the phone that the vessel sustained some damage to a valve. The ship was carrying nearly 12,000 tonnes of oil from Taiwan to Singapore, the news agency reported. The Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore said: ""There is no report of oil pollution and traffic in the Singapore Strait is unaffected."" Karishma Vaswani, BBC News, Singapore The timing of this is awkward for the United States. It's the first day ofannual drillsbetween the US and South Korean armies, a show of might in the face of North Korean belligerence. The USS John McCain is part of the US Navy's 7th Fleet, its largest fleet, but this accident will add to questions about the operations of the navy in the region more widely. This is the same naval group that saw a similar accident only in June, when seven US sailors lost their lives. Just last week several officers were disciplined in relation to that incident. This is also thought to be the fourth such collision involving US warships in the past year alone. Add to this the confusion earlier this year over the whereabouts of another US warship in the Pacific - the USS Carl Vinson - which President Trump said was sailing for North Korea, but was actually headed in the opposite direction for training exercises with the Australian navy. Shortly after news of the collision came out, the US chief of naval operations, John Richardson, tweeted that the first priority was to determine the safety of the ship and the crew. US senator John McCain tweeted that he and his wife were praying for the sailors. The vessel was named after his father and grandfather, both admirals in the Navy. Allow Twitter content?

"This video can not be played The clock won't chime again until 2021, except on special occasions Big Ben has fallen silent for major repair work expected to last until 2021. The midday bongs were the last regular chimes from the famous bell until the repairs to its tower are complete. It will still be used for special occasions, including New Year's Eve and Remembrance Sunday. There were cheers and applause from a crowd of tourists and onlookers on the green opposite as the final chime rang out. The decision to switch it off to protect workers' hearing has sparked a debate about the length of time it will be silent, with MPs not being told it would be four years, the longest period in its history. Prime Minister Theresa May has said ""it can't be right"" that the famous bongs will not be heard again until 2021 and has asked for the proposals to be reviewed. The House of Commons has said it will look againat the length of time Big Ben will be silenced after ""concerns"" were raised. How do you take a good photo of Big Ben? Radio Four's nationwide hunt for stand-in bongs The 13.7-tonne Great Bell has sounded on the hour for 157 years and last fell silent in 2007. The Great Clock it forms part of is to be dismantled and repaired. Almost as one, the crowd that had gathered in Parliament Square and on the pavement outside the Palace of Westminster pointed their mobile phones up towards the famous clock. The passing traffic paused, and as the last of Big Ben's bongs sounded - at least until November - cheers broke out. Most of the people who had taken up Parliament's suggestion to witness the last bells spoke of their sadness at the switch-off, and plenty, like Brian Mignot from Tasmania, questioned the four-year timescale. Some, like engineer Neil Tomlinson from Derbyshire, took a pragmatic approach. ""It's got to be repaired, so they're repairing it,"" he said, bemused at the fuss the plans have caused. Others just said they wanted to be there. ""It's a momentous occasion"", said one of the onlookers, Annette Nicholson, from South East London. ""I thought the crowd would be even bigger."" Mark Tan, who had just arrived in the UK on holiday from Singapore, said: ""It's a historic moment but it's good so that it will continue for another 100 years"". Inside the Parliamentary estate, there was more clapping and cheering as noon was struck. Labour MP Stephen Pound - who had hoped to be joined by ""like-minded traditionalists"" to witness the last bongs, said it was a ""desperately sad"" moment and that the  decision showed a ""real poverty of imagination"". Conservative Peter Bone said MPs had not been told the length of the switch off, adding that the timescale ""doesn't make any sense"". ""Maybe Big Ben will be silenced for a little while, but perhaps just until the end of this year, and then back bonging away from the New Year,"" he said. But the SNP's Pete Wishart told them to ""get a grip"" over their ""bizarre obsession"" with the issue. ""The fact that even the prime minister is wasting time on this non-issue shows just how out of touch the Westminster bubble is, when MPs should be working for their constituents on the issues that really matter,"" he added. Liberal Democrat MP Tom Brake, a member of the House of Commons Commission, said one concession to critics could be allowing Big Ben to chime on special occasions. This video can not be played Big Ben: The story behind the Westminster Chimes But he said it was ""too early to say"" whether it would be used on the day the UK leaves the EU in March 2019, as demanded by some Eurosceptic Conservative MPs. He added: ""I understand why people would get excited about Big Ben and the Elizabeth Tower and the clock because they are so symbolic and people come from all over the world to have their photographs taken in front of it, and that's why we need to ensure that these works happen to ensure that this symbol of our Parliament, our nation, is available for people to relish for years to come."" Straight after Big Ben had finished at midday, nearby Westminster Abbey rang its chimes ""to say farewell"". During the repair work, the roof of the Elizabeth Tower will be stripped off and restored, the bell frame repaired, leaks into the clock room stemmed and a lift installed. A brick enclosure in the tower will also be replaced with glass to allow Big Ben to be viewed by people walking up the staircase. The ""drab"" colour scheme on the Great Clock will also be changed to give it a more ""vibrant"" look, officials have said. The Ayrton Light, which shines when the Commons and Lords are sitting, will be ""off for some time"" but the timescale will not be finalised until later this year.

"This video can not be played The concert by Aryana Sayeed was a rare event in Kabul Hundreds of young men and women attended a concert by Afghan pop star Aryana Sayeed in the capital Kabul despite opposition from conservatives, and threats of an attack. The concert was held amid tight security at the heavily protected Intercontinental Hotel. It was a rare music concert in the city. Kabul has witnessed a series of suicide attacks and explosions in the past few months. Saturday evening's concert was originally scheduled to be held in Ghazi stadium to mark the country's Independence Day. More than 3,000 tickets were sold at premium rates. But the authorities said they could not guarantee security at that venue. Ms Sayeed did not give up. She went ahead with her performance, but at a different venue. Her fans were delighted. ""Despite the threats, I didn't think such a big number of girls would attend here. Fortunately, the number of women is bigger than men,"" said Bahar Sohaili, who attended the concert.. ""I asked some of the girls: 'Why you are here?' They told me they were here to defy those who were against the concert."" Ms Sayeed, described by her fans as Afghanistan's Kim Kardashian, is known for her long hair and figure-hugging outfits, which are seen as taboo by many in Afghanistan. Her music mixes traditional and folk songs rendered as pop. She sings both in Dari and Pashto, Afghanistan's two main languages. Ms Sayeed describes music and celebration as a basic human need A day before the concert, I interviewed Ms Sayeed. She said she was determined to go ahead with the concert, despite the threats. ""I am taking this as a very good excuse to be able to give a bit of happiness to my fellow Afghans, who are in dire need of it at the moment,"" she said. She has received a number of death threats from those who say her outfits and public shows are an affront to Afghan culture. ""There are certain people in Afghanistan who have been against music, against celebration, against even New Year, Eid and everything. I feel like today we need to stand together and fight against it,"" said Ms Sayeed. ""At the end of the day, we are also human beings and these are basic human needs - music, celebration, Independence Day, New Year."" Ms Sayeed said she would donate the proceeds from the concert to the families of those killed by Islamist militants in an attack on the village of Mirza Olong in northern Sar-e-Pul province.
