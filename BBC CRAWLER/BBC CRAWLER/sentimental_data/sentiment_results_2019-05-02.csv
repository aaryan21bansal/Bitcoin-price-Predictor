"Further evidence that taking anti-HIV drugs stops gay men passing on the virus to sexual partners has been called a ""powerful message"" which should be more widely known. A study of nearly 1,000 gay male couples in The Lancet,externalfound no cases of HIV transmission over eight years. This was due to treatment reducing the virus to very low levels in the body. ""Undetectable equals untransmittable"" should be basic HIV knowledge for everyone, experts said. The European study followed 972 gay male couples - where one was living with HIV and taking antiretroviral therapy (ART) and the other was HIV negative - over eight years, from 2010-2017. There were no cases of HIV being passed within the couples over that time. And the researchers say that around 472 cases of HIV are likely to have been prevented. In total, the couples reported having anal sex without condoms a total of 76,088 times. Although 15 men did become infected with HIV during the study, genetic testing showed that none of the viruses came from their main partner. ""Our findings provide conclusive evidence that the risk of HIV transmission through anal sex when HIV viral load is suppressed is effectively zero,"" the researchers said. Treatment for HIV should start as soon as possible after diagnosis Prof Alison Rodger, study author and professor of infectious diseases at University College London, said anal sex was known to have the highest risk of transmission, but gay men should be reassured. ""This powerful message can help end the HIV pandemic by preventing HIV transmission, and tackling the stigma and discrimination that many people with HIV face."" She called for all people living with HIV to have access to testing and effective treatment. Matt Stokes, 26, was diagnosed with HIV in 2016 and started drug therapy four weeks later. Tests showed the virus was undetectable in his body within three months. ""It's a huge relief and gives me self confidence to know I can't pass on the virus,"" he says. ""Among the gay community and my friends there has been a real change in recent years - you can put 'undetectable' on Grindr, for example."" But there's a long way to go before everyone knows what it means, he adds. ""Some people don't want to believe it. They have an irrational fear it might not be true."" He says charities campaigning on the issue are giving the message ""a huge boost"" and changing views on sex. Deborah Gold, chief executive of NAT (National AIDS Trust) said more should be done to get the message out to healthcare workers and the general public. ""There needs to be a much better understanding of how HIV is and isn't transmitted, and the fact that treatment stops transmission, in the NHS and beyond. We think this is vital to addressing stigma."" Previous research has shown zero risk for heterosexual couples of passing on the virus, when one person is taking HIV treatment, prompting UNAIDS to launch itsundetectable = untransmittable,externalcampaign. Taking HIV drug PrEP 'doesn't mean you're promiscuous' Game-changer: 'I didn't know HIV drug existed' Dr Ford Hickson, from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said the study confirmed that if people suppress their HIV with antiretroviral therapy, they ""cannot pass their virus to other people during sex, whatever kind of sex they have"". Anti-HIV drugs, or antiretroviral therapy, suppresses the virus to undetectable levels In the study, the men with HIV had been taking antiretroviral therapy for an average of four years before it began, making the virus undetectable - defined as fewer than 200 copies per ml of blood. Most people reach this level after taking daily HIV treatment for six months. It is a combination of drugs, to be taken daily, to stop HIV replicating in the body. It can't cure HIV, but it can reduce the amount of virus to undetectable levels in the blood. Most people with HIV take a combination pill once a day but others can take up to four pills a day depending on their specific health needs. Everyone is recommended to start treatment straight away after being diagnosed. Dr Michael Brady, medical director at Terrence Higgins Trust, said: ""The study has given us the confidence to say, without doubt, that people living with HIV who are on effective treatment cannot pass the virus on to their sexual partners. ""This has incredible impact on the lives of people living with HIV and is a powerful message to address HIV-related stigma."" In the UK, 98% of people diagnosed with HIV are receiving treatment - and 97% of those have an undetectable level of the virus - meaning they are unable to pass on the infection. But figures from Public Health England estimate than only 92% of the 101,600 of people living with HIV have been diagnosed.

"Henry Vincent and another man broke into Richard Osborn-Brooks's home in Hither Green A 79-year-old man who killed an armed burglar with a kitchen knife acted lawfully, an inquest has decided. Richard Osborn-Brooks stabbed Henry Vincent with a knife in Hither Green, south-east London, in April last year. Mr Osborn-Brooks told Southwark Coroner's Court the 37-year-old had threatened him with a screwdriver, then ""rushed forward"" and ""ran into the knife I was holding"". Coroner Andrew Harris recorded a verdict of lawfully killing. Speaking by videolink, Mr Osborn-Brooks told the inquest he still believed the intruder was ""intending to do me harm"" during the break-in on 4 April 2018. He said two men had knocked on his door, grabbed him and pushed him inside. Both then demanded money as one then shoved him toward the kitchen and the other ran upstairs. He told the hearing that when he grabbed the knife, Mr Vincent's accomplice fled out of the front door but the intruder came down the stairs holding the screwdriver and saying ""get out of my way or I'll stick you with this"". Mr Osborn-Brooks said he had then warned Mr Vincent that his weapon was ""bigger than yours"". ""I thought he would look at my knife... and he would take the opportunity to run out the front door which was open. ""He definitely didn't try to get out of the front door, he came towards me,"" Mr Osborn-Brooks said. Mr Osborn-Brooks said Mr Vincent threatened him with a screwdriver during the raid Mr Vincent's cause of death was given as an incised wound to the chest. His sister had told the hearing her brother was ""not a violent person"". ""He was a father, he was a son, he was a brother. No one deserves to die,"" Rosie Vincent said. In a statement, the pathologist who carried out the post-mortem examination said a toxicology report indicated ""a recent use of both cocaine and heroin"". He said Mr Vincent ""may have been experiencing the effects"" at the time of the raid. Senior coroner Andrew Harris said: ""The interaction that led to the stabbing was the simultaneous approach of the deceased with a small screwdriver and the forward movement of the householder with a kitchen knife, leading to moderate force being applied by the knife to Mr Vincent's chest, and its penetration. ""The householder was terrified and asserted he acted in self-defence after an assault by the other intruder. He was close to, but not obstructing, the exit by the intruder.""

"This video can not be played Bank of England governor, Mark Carney Interest rate increases could be ""more frequent"" than expected if the economy performs as the Bank of England is expecting, governor Mark Carney says. The markets are forecasting just one interest rate increase by 2021. But if there is a resolution to the Brexit impasse, and inflation and growth continue to pick-up, then more increases are likely, Mr Carney said. As expected, the Bank kept interest rates on hold at 0.75% at its latest policy meeting. Interest rates have been at that level since last August, when the Bank raised them by a quarter of a percentage point. The Bank is expecting growth and inflation to pick up over the next two years. Slight fall in UK unemployment Wanted: New Bank of England boss In a news conference, Mr Carney said: ""If something broadly like this forecast comes to pass... it will require interest rate increases over that period and it will require more, and more frequent interest rate increases, than the market currently expects."" The Bank's forecasts are based on a ""smooth adjustment"" to any new trading relationship with the European Union. In its Quarterly Inflation Report,,externalthe Bank of England raised its UK growth forecast for this year, in part because the outlook for the global economy is a bit brighter. The Bank now sees growth of 1.5% this year, up from February's forecast of 1.2%. Economic growth has been subdued since the UK voted in June 2016 to leave the EU. In particular, business investment has been falling. The Bank says stockpiling has been giving the economy a short-term boost, but for this year, the strengthening of the global economy will have a more important effect. In the minutes from its latest policy meeting,external, the Bank said ""global growth had shown signs of stabilisation, and had been a little better than expected"". It also forecasts the unemployment rate will continue falling in the coming years to 3.5% by 2022, which would be the lowest rate since 1973. The Bank is reluctant to move interest rates until there is further clarity, not least about the path of Brexit. For as it highlights (again), the movement in rates then could be ""in either direction"", depending on the outcome, the impact on the economy and whether it decides to support growth or inflation. If all goes smoothly, then the Bank is likely to turn its firepower on inflation and proceed with raising rates ""at a gradual pace and to a limited extent"" - especially if there's a bounce in investment and hiring. At the moment, the MPC reckons ""the cost of waiting for further information is relatively low"". But that, given the degree of inflationary pressure it's forecasting, is quite a gamble. If the Bank has missed the boat, then rates might have to ultimately rise faster and by more than originally envisaged to curb inflation. That would be an unenviable parting gift from Mr Carney to his successor. Read Dharshini's analysis in full. Moves in interest rates are important to the 3.5 million people with variable or tracker mortgages. Even a small quarter-point rise can add hundreds of pounds to their annual mortgage costs. Mortgage market experts say that for those who can afford to buy a home, now is a good time to borrow. ""Right now, you've got lenders that want your business and rates are exceptionally low,"" said David Hollingworth, from L&C Mortgages. Some lenders are offering five-year fixed deals at below 2%, he said. Even borrowers with a small deposit can find competitive rates of interest, he added. The Bank expects a fall in UK house prices this year, with property values predicted to drop by 1.25%. It says some households are likely to have delayed moving house because of Brexit uncertainty. It also says that affordability is also slowing the market, particularly in areas where prices are high, such as London and the South East. Last month,the government launched the recruitment process for a new governor for the Bank of England. Mark Carney will step down on 31 January 2020 after more than six years in the post. Interviews will be held over the summer and the appointment will be made by the government in the autumn. The government is under pressure to consider female candidates, as men hold the Bank's key positions. At the moment, the Monetary Policy Committee, which sets interest rates, only has one female among its nine members. When asked about the lack of diversity at the Bank, Mr Carney said ""big progress"" had been made with women now making up 31% of senior management.

"Milo Yiannopoulous, Alex Jones and Louis Farrakhan have all been banned Facebook is banning several prominent figures it regards as ""dangerous individuals"". The social network accused Alex Jones, host of right-wing conspiracy website InfoWars, its UK editor Paul Joseph Watson and ex-Breitbart News editor Milo Yiannopoulos of hate speech. Louis Farrakhan, the Nation of Islam leader who has expressed anti-Semitic views, will also be excluded. Facebook has already banned anti-Islamic UK groups like Britain First. The latest ban also applies on Instagram, which Facebook owns. ""Weâve always banned individuals or organisations that promote or engage in violence and hate, regardless of ideology,â the company said in a statement. ""The process for evaluating potential violators is extensive and it is what led us to our decision to remove these accounts today."" The banned group also includes Paul Nehlen, a white supremacist, and Laura Loomer, an anti-Islamic activist with a large social media presence. In November, Ms Loomer handcuffed herself to a Twitter building in New York in protest at being banned from that platform. Laura Loomer is among those banned from the platform White supremacist Paul Nehlen, right, has twice run in Republican primaries However, Facebook has been criticised for giving forewarning of the bans, giving those affected a chance to redirect their followers to other services. For a brief time on Thursday, Alex Jones was broadcasting, on Facebook, about his impending ban. âIâm about to be banned,"" wrote Mr Yiannopoulos to his followers on Instagram. ""Please sign up for my mailing list before this account disappears."" A spokesperson at Facebook said the ban will apply to all types of representation of the individuals on both Facebook and Instagram. The firm said it would remove pages, groups and accounts set up to represent them, and would not allow the promotion of events when it knows the banned individual is participating. In an email, Facebook explained its rationale for banning the users: It said Alex Jones had hosted on his programme Gavin McInnes, leader of the Proud Boys, whose members are known for racist, anti-Muslim and misogynistic rhetoric. Mr McInnes has been designated a ""hate figure"" by Facebook Facebook said this year Milo Yiannopoulos had publicly praised both Mr McInnes and English Defence League founder Tommy Robinson, both banned from the network Laura Loomer also appeared with Mr McInnes, and Facebook said she also praised another banned figure, Faith Goldy, a Canadian Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan was banned for making several anti-Semitic remarks earlier this year _______ Follow Dave Lee on Twitter@DaveLeeBBC,external Do you have more information about this or any other technology story?

"This video can not be played The drone had to be custom-built A donor kidney has been delivered to surgeons at a US hospital via drone, in the first flight of its kind. Many see huge potential for unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) delivering medical products, with some drones already doing so in Africa. The US flight required a specially-designed drone which was able to maintain and monitor the organ. It is hoped that it can pave the way for longer flights and address safety issue with current transport methods. The recipient, a 44-year-old from Baltimore, had waited eight years for the transplant. She said of the unusual delivery method: ""This whole thing is amazing. Years ago, this was not something that you would think about."" According to the United Network for Organ Sharing, which manages organ transplants in the US, in 2018 there were nearly 114,000 people on waiting lists, with 1.5% of organs not making it to the destination and nearly 4% being delayed by two hours or more. The drone took off at night ""Delivering an organ from a donor to a patient is a sacred duty with many moving parts. It is critical that we find ways of doing this better,"" said Joseph Scalea, assistant professor of surgery at University of Maryland School of Medicine (UMSOM), and one of the surgeons who performed the transplant. ""As a result of the outstanding collaboration among surgeons, engineers, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), organ procurement specialists, pilots, nurses, and, ultimately, the patient, we were able to make a pioneering breakthrough in transplantation."" The three-mile journey required a lot of new technology, including a custom-made drone capable of carrying the additional weight of an organ, which also needed on-board cameras and organ tracking, and communications and safety systems for a flight over an urban, densely-populated area. It also had a parachute recovery system in case the aircraft failed. The drone's mission was a success and the patient has now left hospital ""There's a tremendous amount of pressure knowing there's a person waiting for that organ, but it's also a special privilege to be a part of this critical mission,"" said Matthew Scassero, part of the engineering team based at the University of Maryland. Charlie Alexander, chief executive of The Living Legacy Foundation of Maryland, a charity working to increase organ donation, said: ""If we can prove that this works, then we can look at much greater distances of unmanned organ transport. ""This would minimise the need for multiple pilots and flight time and address safety issues we have in our field.""

"The armed forces did not appear to heed Mr GuaidÃ³'s call to defect Venezuelan President NicolÃ¡s Maduro has appeared flanked by soldiers at an army base in Caracas, in a show of defiance towards his opponents. Mr Maduro called on the armed forces to defeat ""any coup plotter"", following two days of clashes between opposition and pro-government forces. Opposition leader Juan GuaidÃ³ tried on Wednesday to spark a military rebellion and force Mr Maduro from office. Mr GuaidÃ³ has urged public employees to strike to undermine the government. But Mr Maduro praised the army's loyalty. ""No-one dare touch our sacred ground or bring war to Venezuela"", he said. This video can not be played Tear gas and water cannon hit Venezuela protesters on Wednesday Four people died in the clashes, including two teenagers. In January, Mr GuaidÃ³ declared himself Venezuela's interim leader and he has the support of more than 50 countries including the US, UK and most Latin America nations. Frustrated protesters await next opportunity Venezuela crisis in 300 words As the head of the opposition-controlled National Assembly, he invoked the constitution to assume an interim presidency, arguing that Mr Maduro's re-election last year was illegitimate. But Mr Maduro - who is backed by Russia, China and the leaders of Venezuela's military - has refused to cede power. Who is Juan GuaidÃ³? Profile: NicolÃ¡s Maduro The president dismissed a claim by US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo that he had been ready to flee the country, and accused the US of directing an attempted coup. On Wednesday, both pro- and anti-government supporters held demonstrations in Caracas that were initially peaceful. There were reports of gunfire in the city, and a local NGO, the Venezuelan Observatory of Social Conflict, said Jurubith Rausseo, 27, had been shot dead during a rally in the opposition stronghold of Altamira. At least 46 people were injured in clashes between opposition supporters and the security forces.

Is there a new cult of personality in Venezuela? How much aid is getting into Venezuela? Who is buying Venezuela's oil? He urged Venezuelans to join them on the streets, and appeared alongside another opposition leader, Leopoldo LÃ³pez, who had been under house arrest after being found guilty of inciting violence during protests in 2014. Spain's government later said that Mr LÃ³pez and his family had sought safety in their embassy, but said the opposition figure had not claimed political asylum. A court issued an arrest warrant for Mr LÃ³pez for violating the house arrest order,according to a statement on the Supreme Court's website.,externalThe order stated that Mr LÃ³pez should continue to serve the rest of his 13-year sentence in prison. Spain said it had no intention of handing over Mr LÃ³pez to the Venezuelan authorities. In a series of tweets (in Spanish), Mr GuaidÃ³ said the final phase of ""Operation Liberty"" had begun and it was the turn of public workers to join in. He urged protesters to stay on the streets until Mr Maduro's government was finally forced to resign. Mr GuaidÃ³ has been courting the public sector for weeks - but winning their support will be difficult, says BBC's Americas editor Candace Piette. For years, state employees have been told that if they did not turn up at government rallies, they would lose their jobs. Mr Maduro also addressed his supporters in the capital Tensions are rising between the US and Russia over the crisis. US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the US may take military action to resolve the crisis, and accused Russia and Cuba of destabilising the country through their support for Mr Maduro. The US also reiterated its support for Mr GuaidÃ³. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov told Mr Pompeo that America's influence over Venezuela was destructive and a violation of international law.

"The UK Treasury has reprieved 1p and 2p coins, saying they will continue to be used ""for years to come"". The copper coins were theoretically under threat when Chancellor Philip Hammond consulted on the current mix of coins and banknotes in circulation. The chancellor has now said he wants people to ""have a choice"" over how they spend their money. He has also set up a group to oversee the cash system, ensuring everyone can get hold of their money in cash. The Treasury has estimated that 2.2 million people in the UK are reliant on cash, particularly the elderly, vulnerable, and those living in rural areas. Anindependent review of cashpublished in March suggested that banknotes and coins were a necessity for eight million people. Cash use has been falling dramatically in recent years. In 2017, debit card use - driven by contactless payments - overtook the number of payments made in cash in the UK for the first time. However, there were still nearly 241 million 1p coins minted that year and nearly 17 million 2p coins produced. Surveys have suggested six in 10 of UK 1p and 2p coins are only used once before being put in a jar or discarded, while one in 12 is thrown into a bin. The rising cost of living has also eaten away at their value. In effect, the 1p coin is now worth less than the halfpenny when it was abolished in 1984. In his Spring Statement in 2018, the chancellor's call for views on the mix of notes and coins appeared topave the way for the end of 1p and 2p coins, as well as the future of Â£50 notes, once described as the ""currency of corrupt elites, of crime of all sorts and of tax evasion"". Aswift reverse by the Prime Minister's official spokesmandeclared there were no plans to scrap the copper coins. A later announcement of a plastic redesign for the Â£50 note alsoconfirmed the survivalof the Bank of England's highest value note. However, the consultation continued, with the government's final view unknown until now. Many countries - including Canada, the home of the current Bank of England governor Mark Carney - have ditched a denomination coin. Australia, Brazil, and Sweden are among many others to do so. However, the chancellor was accused of being a ""penny pincher"" by opposition parties when the consultation on the UK's mix of coins was launched, prompting 10 Downing Street's intervention. Mr Hammond said that the decision to leave the current mix of notes and coins unchanged was a matter of public freedom. ""It is clear that many people still rely on cash and I want the public to have a choice over how they spend the money,"" he said. Your eight uses for 1p and 2p coins Scrapping 1p and 2p copper coins 'won't increase prices' Who do you trust after cash? The decision was welcomed by the trade body for small businesses, which has consistently called for the status quo. ""Keeping 1p and 2p coins in circulation is the right call,"" said Mike Cherry, national chairman of the Federation for Small Businesses. ""The freedom to use pennies is still important to a lot of small firms. For many, being able to charge prices that end in 99p rather than a round pound figure can be enough to tip intrigue into a sale, particularly where lower-value items are concerned."" The future of pennies clouded the bigger picture of the future of cash in general, according to former financial ombudsman Natalie Ceeney, the author of theAccess to Cash Review,external. ""The issue is not 1p and 2p coins,"" she said. ""The issue is whether cash is going to stay viable."" She said that by chipping away at the mix of coins, the government would have been giving the impression that it did not care about cash. Instead she said that the announcement of a government-led group to support access and help safeguard cash for those who needed it was ""a clear statement of intent"", and ""a good start"" in ensuring the UK did not sleepwalk into a cashless society. She said her focus was on the 20% of people who would be left behind without cash, and she still wanted a clear commitment from regulators that they had the same focus. The Emerging Payments Association, which represents financial technology companies (Fintechs), argued that more needed to be done to ensure the nation's most vulnerable were given the education and guidance to allow them to have the chance to use mainstream digital services, rather than having to rely on cash.

"The future of 1p and 2p coins may be in doubt - but it seems their use goes way beyond simply paying for things. Treasury officialsare seeking views on the future mix of UK notes and coinsas we increasingly move towards digital and mobile payments. It conjures up the image of people throwing their smartphones, rather than coppers, into a fountain for good luck - although Downing Street has backed away from a plan to scrap copper coins. According to BBC News readers, viewers and listeners there are many other uses for these coins, from home improvements to baking. Here is a selection. Many flower sellers and lovers swear by the use of pennies in a vase to keep them from drooping. Reader Chris Stone says: ""The question the government should really be asking is if they end copper coins, what will we put in our vases with tulips? Is this part of their strategy to restrict growth?"" They say the copper is important, and it is unlikely they would want to dunk a fiver in the vase - even though the new polymer banknotes are waterproof. From pretty penny to penny-wise, there are dozens of phrases in the English language in which pennies play a part. A number of people have said this is part of British culture. If they are replaced by digital payments, will the language become less elegant? ""A crypto-currency for your thoughts"" just isn't poetic. Various uses have been found for pennies among DIY enthusiasts. Some have used thousands of pennies as flooring or to tile walls, although it takes quite a bit of patience and glue to achieve the desired effect. Others have found more practical uses. On Twitter, DogKick says they are ""great as a standby screwdriver for slot-headed screws"". Teachers swear by coins when it comes to helping youngsters learn to count and add up. It is best to start with ones and twos, and considerably more challenging if they could only use fives and tens. BBC News website readers have also expressed their worries over the future of games using pennies. Paul Watts says: ""I save 2p coins during the year and my family use them to play the card game Newmarket at Christmas. ""There is a lot of joy in everyone's faces when the kitty builds up. But when it is won it, only amounts to around Â£2.40, but then it hasn't cost anyone a lot of money if they lose! ""Imagine no 2p coins and having to play with 5p coins. That would then be potentially an expensive card game at Christmas -unless you won."" Others have spoken of switching coins to play the game variously known as penny up, or penny up the wall, or penny pitching - where players try to rebound their coins onto the coins of their opponents. The leisure theme continues with an appeal from one reader over the future of a traditional game in the UK's amusement arcades. ""Snooker Bob"", from Aylesbury, writes: ""We love the 2p coin and save them up every year for our trip to the seaside. These would not be the same without a visit to the arcades with their 'penny falls'. ""A couple of pounds of these coins can give pleasure to adults and children alike. What is the alternative? Five pence pieces are too small and 10 pence coins too expensive. Please do not take this pleasure away and also jeopardise the jobs of those who work in them."" John White, chief executive of the amusement industry trade body Bacta, agrees, saying that other coins would not work in these machines. ""Generations of British families know and love them. This will destroy the product and a number of seaside arcades in the UK,"" he says. There is another geographical concern, expressed by Linda Wooldridge on Twitter. ""Cities can work with contactless cards, rural and village shops not so - they work on real money,"" she says. The phrase ""unexpected item in the bagging area"" remains one of the most annoying in the English language. So, to get their revenge, or simply for good money management, many shoppers use their stock of pennies to pay at a supermarket self-service checkout machine. Mariama on Twitter says: ""I only ever use the self-service checkout."" Others worry about the effect on prices. BBC News website reader Denise Ellis says: ""I would be sorry to see the 1p and 2p go - it would be yet another sign of inflation if all prices were rounded up to the nearest 5p or 10p. Having said that though, the pricing of lots of things at Â£x.99 is annoying."" David Barber, from St Neots, Cambridgeshire. says: ""We must not get rid of 1p and 2p coins. It would be another kick in teeth for those in our country who have very little income, be it pension or benefits. Price increases would need to be a minimum of 5p if there are no lower denomination coins."" But Gillian Crawley, from Kingswood in Surrey, says: ""Of course 1p and 2p coins should be discontinued - they are now pointless, weigh down purses and pockets, and their loss might discourage the ridiculous habit of pricing most things at, for example, Â£2.99 rather than Â£3. That fools no one and has been going on for far too long."" Mike Cherry, the national chairman of the Federation of Small Businesses, says: ""It is important for a proper impact assessment to be carried out before any actions which might restrict the availability of 1p and 2p coins. ""While growing numbers of transactions are paid for electronically, cash is still an essential part of the mix for many small businesses. A retailer wanting to charge 99p should still be able to hand a penny change to a customer who pays with a Â£1 coin."" Sarah Fox, on Twitter, says pennies are ""good for blind baking"". BBC Good Food explains that this is the process of pre-cooking a pastry base - a sure-fire way to avoid the dreaded soggy bottom. Apparently, the unbaked pie crust is lined with scrunched-up parchment, which can then be weighed down with pennies. Many readers were concerned with the potential loss for charities, as many pop coins in a jar and donate when the jar is full. Thomas says: ""How many other people also deposit this 'shrapnel' into charity tins and if we withdrew the coins, how much would income would they lose?"" Andy, from Marlow, says: ""I put all my 1p and 2p pieces in charity jars. It isn't much, but everyone doing it would surely make a difference."" Charities do face the cost of processing coins, so would no doubt prefer donations by direct debit or in bigger denominations. The question is, whether this would make up for the money lost if there were no coppers to donate? Is this the end for 1p and 2p coins? Should we get rid of the penny?

"Trans woman Stephanie Hayden claimed a Catholic journalist harassed her in a series of tweets A judge has told a transgender lawyer and a Catholic journalist involved in an  ""out of control"" Twitter row not to mention each other online. Trans woman Stephanie Hayden has been granted an injunction against Caroline Farrow after a ""barrage"" of tweets. At a High Court hearing in London, Mr Justice Bryan also asked Ms Hayden to not mention Mrs Farrow, and she agreed. The judge said tweets sent by mother-of-five Mrs Farrow, whose husband is a priest, had ""crossed the line"". An interim injunction bans Mrs Farrow from mentioning Ms Hayden, in particular from ""misgendering"" her, by referring to her as male when she is legally female. The judge said: ""The tweetingâ¦ has got out of control.  Each have said things in those tweets which, in the cold light of day in this court, I would anticipate they would rather wish they had not done."" Representing herself, Ms Hayden told the judge the debate with Mrs Farrow had been going on since January. She claimed Mrs Farrow harassed her in a series of tweets, suggesting she was violent, misgendering her and posting a photograph of her. Mrs Farrow denied this and her lawyers argued she had been subjected to ""a positive avalanche of abuse over a number of months"" from Ms Hayden. The two have previously been involved in Twitter rows over similar issues, the court heard. Mrs Farrow was investigated by policeafter the founder of transgender support charity Mermaids, Susie Green, accused the commentator of misgendering her daughter on Twitter. Ms Green later withdrew the complaint and Surrey Police announced in March they would take no further action.

He was always up for a laugh and we just hit it off immediately and stayed friends for over 40 years."" This video can not be played Mark Hamill: Peter Mayhew was 'as kind and gentle as a Wookiee' Star Wars creator George Lucas had wanted a tall actor to play Chewbacca and initially considered 6ft 6in (1.98m) David Prowse for the role.

""He fought his way back from being wheelchair-bound to stand tall and portray Chewbacca once more in Star Wars: The Force Awakens,"" his family said. Mayhew also consulted on The Last Jedi, released in 2017, in an attempt to pass on the secrets of the role to his successor, Finland's Joonas Suotamo.

He was a good friend, and I'm saddened by his passing."" Lucasfilm president Kathleen Kennedy added: ""Peter's iconic portrayal of the loyal, lovable Chewbacca has been absolutely integral to the character's success, and to the Star Wars saga itself. ""When I first met Peter during The Force Awakens, I was immediately impressed by his kind and gentle nature. ""Peter was brilliantly able to express his personality through his skilful use of gesture, posture, and eyes. We all love Chewie, and have Peter to thank for that enduring memory.""

"Nancy Pelosi says Attorney general William Barr ""lied to Congress"" US Speaker Nancy Pelosi has accused the Attorney General William Barr of lying to Congress. Her comments came a day after Mr Barr's testimony to a Senate panel about Special Counsel Robert Mueller's report on Russia's alleged meddling in 2016. Mr Barr faced sharp questioning about his decision to clear President Donald Trump of obstruction of justice. The top US law official refused to testify to Democratic-led House Judiciary Committee on Thursday. The stand-off raises the prospect that Mr Barr - America's top legal official - could be held in contempt of Congress. Five looming fights between Congress and Trump Trump 'tried to get Mueller fired' Eight new things in the Mueller report ""He lied to Congress. And if anybody else did that it would be considered a crime,"" Ms Pelosi said on Thursday. ""Nobody is above the law,"" she added. Ms Pelosi's accusation stems from Mr Barr saying he was not aware of any complaints Mr Mueller had about the attorney general's four-page summary of his report. Mr Mueller wrote a letterto Mr Barr saying the summary lacked ""context"". ""It wasn't about technicalities,"" Ms Pelosi told reporters. ""The attorney general of the United States of America was not telling the truth to the Congress of the United States. That's a crime."" Allow Twitter content?

But a spokeswoman for the department of justice hit back at Ms Pelosi after her comments. ""The baseless attack on the attorney general is reckless, irresponsible and false,"" spokeswoman Kerri Kupec said. Republicans also condemned the remarks. Senator Lindsey Graham told reporters it was an ""offensive statement"" and said Ms Pelosi should apologise. ""I think it says more about her than it does about Bill Barr,"" he added. In a press conference on Thursday morning, Nancy Pelosi directly accused William Barr of committing a crime. What are Democrats going to do about it? Ms Pelosi only made vague references to a ""process"", but they have several options if they want to punish the attorney general. They could make a criminal referral for lying to Congress, which would be forwarded to a US attorney in Mr Barr's justice department. They could hold Mr Barr in contempt of Congress, which would have to be enforced by US attorneys in the Trump administration. The House of Representatives could also vote to formally censure the attorney general, putting a black mark on his record but not much more. Finally, they could try to impeach the attorney general and have him removed from office. The process would be similar to that for removing a US president - a majority vote in the House of Representatives followed by a trial in the US Senate requiring a two-thirds vote to ""convict"". Only one cabinet official has ever been impeached - Ulysses S Grant's Secretary of War William Belknap in 1876 - and he was ultimately acquitted of corruption charges by the Senate. William Barr appeared before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Wednesdayand defended his handling of the Special Counsel's 448-page investigation. This video can not be played Why did the chicken go to Congress? It came after Mr Mueller's letter was released, revealing he had twice requested that Mr Barr give more information about the report's conclusions. But Mr Barr said the special counsel was not concerned with the accuracy of the summary and only with how it was being reported by media. ""My understanding was his concern was not the accuracy of the statement of the findings in my letter, but that he wanted more out there to provide additional context to explain his reasoning and why he didn't reach a decision on obstruction,"" he said. Mr Barr also declared he was ""absolutely"" confident in his own judgment that Mr Trump did not unlawfully attempt to impede the investigation. But Democratic Senator Mazie Hirono told the attorney general at Wednesday's hearing that he had betrayed a ""sacred trust"". This video can not be played Why no charge of obstruction of justice? A law professor breaks down the legal questions ""America deserves better. You should resign."" And a tweet showing Democratic Senator Kamala Harris questioning Mr Barr at Wednesday's hearing has now been viewed more than four million times. Allow Twitter content?

Republicans however defended Mr Barr, saying the issue of whether or not President Trump obstructed justice or colluded with the Russians had been settled. ""As far as I'm concerned, this is over,"" Senator John Kennedy tweeted. ""It's time to move on."" The attorney general was scheduled to appear before House Judiciary Committee on Thursday for further questioning about the Mueller probe, but failed to appear. There has been a growing call for Mr Barr to resign, including from numerous candidates for the Democratic Party's presidential nomination in the 2020 election. Ms Harris and her colleagues Senators Elizabeth Warren and Kirsten Gillibrand all called for him to step down on Twitter, as did former Texas congressman Beto O'Rourke. Democratic Committee chair Jerrold Nadler has threatened to hold Mr Barr in contempt of Congress after he missed a deadline to release the full Mueller report. ""We will make one more good-faith attempt to negotiate and to get the access to the report that we need, and then if we don't get that, we will proceed to hold the attorney general in contempt,"" he told reporters. In a more light-hearted display, Democratic congressman Steve Cohen brought a bucket of fried chicken and a chicken statue to the House Judiciary Committee hearing on Thursday, and left them in Mr Barr's vacant seat.

After posting the video Ella, who has Down's syndrome, was ridiculed online, and Mr Markham was also subjected to abuse for posting the video.

"Climate change campaigners have staged protests in Edinburgh The Scottish government will legislate to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to net-zero by 2045 after receiving fresh advice from an expert panel. The Committee on Climate Change,external(CCC) urged that Scotland set the targetfive years ahead of the UK as a whole. The panel says Scotland has more potential sites for carbon capture and a greater landmass for tree planting. It came after a report to the UN last year urged the world to go ""further and faster"" in tackling climate change. And on SundayFirst Minister Nicola Sturgeon declared a ""climate emergency""in her speech to the SNP party conference. Net-zero is the point where the same volume of greenhouse gases is being emitted as is being absorbed through offsetting techniques like forestry. What is climate emergency? What is climate change? Where we are in seven charts and what you can do to help Despite being low-tech, trees are still the most powerful tool in removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere through photosynthesis which turns the gas into oxygen. Scotland has potential sites for carbon capture Committee chairman Lord Deben said: ""Scotland has been a leader within the UK with many of its policies to tackle climate change. ""By setting a strong net-zero target for 2045 it can continue that leadership on the world stage. ""It will be tough, but it can be done and Scotland's strong track record positions it well to succeed."" The terms carbon neutral and net-zero are often used interchangeably but there are differences. Carbon dioxide (CO2) is the most abundant greenhouse gas but there are others which the Scottish government counts and they are not all carbon-based. Therefore, some climate change campaigners prefer the term net-zero as it includes not just CO2 and methane but also nitrous oxide, which is emitted during agricultural and industrial activities as well as from fossil fuels. Simply being carbon neutral would not stop global warming because these other gases are also harmful to the atmosphere. Perhaps an even better term would be ""climate neutral"". Scotland's current target, set in the Climate Change Act, is to reduce emissions by 80% by 2050 compared with benchmark levels from 1990. A new bill currently going through the Scottish Parliament aims to increase that target to 90%. It will now be amended so MSPs can vote on the new target of net-zero by 2045. Trees are a powerful tool to remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere Ministers have said they would aim for net-zero when there is a ""credible pathway to achieve it"". Scotland's environment secretary Roseanna Cunningham said: ""There is a global climate emergency and people across Scotland have been calling, rightly, for more ambition to tackle it and safeguard our planet for future generations. ""Having received independent, expert advice that even higher targets are now possible, and given the urgency required on this issue, I have acted immediately to set a target for net-zero greenhouse gas emissions for 2045 which will see Scotland become carbon neutral by 2040."" She called on the UK government to follow Scotland's lead and warned that everyone needs to take action, including businesses, schools and communities. Nicola Sturgeon was questioned about plans to cut aviation tax During First Minister's Questions, Nicola Sturgeon was challenged on proposals for a devolved air departure tax - which would be 50% lower than the current air passenger duty. Last month theScottish government said legal issues surrounding the plans would not be resolved until after April 2020. Alison Johnstone of the Scottish Greens called on Ms Sturgeon to abandon the ""unfair and environmentally damaging"" proposals. She said the money should instead be invested in active travel and public transport. Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard also urged Ms Sturgeon to drop her commitment to the plans ""once and for all"". The first minister stressed that the cut in aviation tax was not going ahead this year. She said the government would have to review every policy in order to meet the new climate change targets. ""Setting targets is one thing, having the policy programme in place to meet them is what matters,"" she added. The CCC advice recommends a net-zero target of 2050 for the UK as a whole, with Wales urged to reduce emissions by 95% in the same time-frame. To achieve it, the report says a fifth of agricultural land needs to shift to alternative uses that support emissions reductions such as forestry or biomass production. It adds that carbon capture and storage would be crucial. Climate change food calculator: What's your diet's carbon footprint? Ten simple ways to act on climate change How can I help? As well as the 2045 aim, the committee advises interim targets of a 70% reduction in emissions by 2030 and a 90% drop by 2040. In the most recent audit, for 2016, Scottish emissions were 49% below 1990 levels. The CCC calculates that the new target can be achieved at an annual cost of around 1-2% of GDP. A drop in the cost of technologies like offshore wind and batteries for electric vehicles means that is a similar price tag as the one previously attached to the 80% target. Thousands of Scottish school pupils took part in climate protests last month The UK government's energy minister Greg Clark said the CCC report ""recognises the work we've done to lay the foundations to build a net-zero economy"". He added: ""Few subjects unite people across generations and borders like climate change and I share the passion of those wanting to halt its catastrophic effects. ""One of our proudest achievements as a country is our position as a world-leader in tackling this global challenge - being the first country to raise the issue on the international stage, introduce long-term legally-binding climate reduction targets and cutting emissions further than all other G20 countries.""

The industry body Oil & Gas UK said it was committed to working with both governments on a practical response to the report. Chief executive Deirdre Michie said the reductions must be achieved ""without sacrificing security and affordability of energy supply for consumers"" and in ways which ""do not disadvantage UK industries against their international competitors"". Mike Robinson from Stop Climate Chaos Scotland said the CCC report was ""hugely welcome advice"". The cost of the technology for electric vehicles is falling ""The growing climate movement, from NGOs, youth strikes to Extinction Rebellion, is sending a strong message to our political leaders that rhetoric just isn't good enough,"" he added. ""It's now up to MSPs to show they are listening to public concern and reflect the ambition of this exciting report in the Climate Change Bill currently going through parliament."" The CCC calls for the new targets to be achieved purely through domestic efforts. Some countries, like Norway and Sweden, fund international offsetting schemes which count towards their measurements. It also says the target can only be achieved if policy delivery is ramped up significantly,including an earlier deadline than 2040- as the UK government has proposed - for the phase-out of fossil fuel cars. Creating new forests through afforestation also needs to increase to 20,000 hectares a year across the UK, increasing to 27,000 by 2027.

"Pupils were shocked to find a high proportion of mathematical-type questions within the biology exams Scotland's exams agency has defended this year's biology exams after pupils claimed they were too difficult. A petition criticising the papers and calling for a lower pass mark has reached almost 5,000 signatures. The Scottish Qualifications Authority (SQA) said the National 5 and Higher exams, which pupils sat on Tuesday, were ""valid tests of the subject"". However, some pupils took to social media to complain they were ""more like a maths test"". A petition calling on the SQA to ""change the grade boundaries of the 2019 Higher Biology and Higher Human papers"", complained that they ""were nothing like ANY past paper and 90% of papers were made up of maths."" One pupil wrote: ""Sorry SQA but what was that paper about? It's Nat 5 Biology not Nat 5 Maths, that's Friday, give me a break."" Another said: ""SQA really got me learning an entire course of human biology only to make 90% of the paper maths?"" The petition also featured the complaint: ""The Nat 5 Biology paper was solid. Can't believe I said water was an enzyme."" One of the biology questions from Tuesday's papers Ellie McBride, 17, sat her Nat 5 Biology exam on Tuesday. She wants to be a midwife and needs a good pass in biology to be able to do it at Higher next year. She said she was shocked at the content of the paper. She told the BBC news website: ""All the units, the past papers and areas the teachers recommended I study, seemed to be a waste of time. ""After the exam, our teachers said they were shocked. In past papers, there were one or two problem-solving questions, but the majority of this exam was working out problems and calculations. ""I'm worried now."" The SQA defended the papers, with a spokesman insisting they were set in accordance with course specifications. He said: ""The 2019 Higher Biology and Human Biology question papers, and the National 5 Biology question paper, were all valid tests of the subject, using content from across the course, giving candidates a fair opportunity to display and apply their knowledge and understanding of the course. ""The papers are designed to sample across the full breadth of the course, and ensure candidates have the opportunity to demonstrate their knowledge, skills and understanding."" He added: ""External experts review papers to ensure the standards are consistent with previous papers and course expectations. ""More than 21,000 candidates sat National 5 Biology, while over 14,000 sat Higher Human Biology, and Higher Biology combined, and while we are aware of some discussion on social media, we would suggest this is of a relatively low volume."" Glasgow biology tutor Jane Stratton said it was possible the problem may lie in the way pupils were prepared for the exam. She said: ""One problem is that science teachers are thin on the ground. And a lot of pupils are not being taught the skills. ""The main gripe is that the exam contained a lot of problem solving. They needed scientific inquiry to work out the answers. ""I think the pupils may have been short-changed, but I am not sure if that is by the exam or by the teaching they have received."" Students said the biology paper felt ""like a maths exam"" The latest controversy follows a number of ""social media outcries"" in recent years when some candidates have alleged exams were too difficult. In 2015, there were questions over the Higher Maths paper. Later it emerged that the pass mark had to be reduced to just 34%, which demonstrated thatthe paper had proved to be much harder than planned. Crocodile maths question 'was challenging' 'Too hard' Higher Maths exam pass mark dropped to 34% The SQA has quality control procedures to try and ensure exam papers are consistent from year-to-year. Exam papers are expected to contain a full range of questions covering different aspects of the syllabus of each course. They are also expected to contain a range of questions of varying degrees of difficulty - some that are relatively straightforward to allow a candidate who has done the work to pass, some are harder for those who might get a B and some are harder still for those who might get an A. Grade boundaries and the pass mark for each subject are set after the papers are marked. It is normal for the percentage pass mark to lie anywhere between the mid 40s and mid 50s. However, a pass mark significantly lower than 45% would imply that there was either a problem with the exam paper itself or that the paper had not met the expectation of teachers and candidates. If the ""issue"" with a paper was merely that a question was not similar to one that had appeared in previous years, there would be concern that the reaction implied candidates were being ""taught to the test"" rather than taught the full syllabus of the subject and encouraged to use their skills and knowledge to tackle a problem. When the pass mark and grade boundaries are published later this year it will be possible to assess whether there actually was a problem with the paper.

"This video can not be played The tables turned on the online trolls Tottenham striker Harry Kane has invited a fan subjected to online abuse to be a mascot at the club's last Premier League match of the season. Neil Markham posted a video of his daughter Ella dancing at the club's new stadium after Spurs lost to West Ham. As a result Ella and her father received a slew of online abuse from fans upset about the result. But that was followed by messages of support that Mr Markham said left him ""overwhelmed"". On Saturday Mr Markham, from Banbury, Oxfordshire, posted a video of Ella dancing at the stadium on Twitter with the caption ""the result is never the most important thing"". After posting the video Ella, who has Down's syndrome, was ridiculed online, and Mr Markham was also subjected to abuse for posting the video. He said: ""Ella was being called all sorts of names, [people were] laughing at her in terms of the way she was dancing and the way she looked. ""I was getting abuse in terms of having a child with Down's syndrome."" But Mr Markham said the response from people in support of Ella ""has been absolutely phenomenal"". Most importantly for Ella, her favourite player Harry Kane sent his own video of support to the family. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"The government does not think it necessary to refer the National Security Council leak to the police, the PM's de facto deputy says. Responding to calls from MPs for a police inquiry, David Lidington said the PM considered the matter ""closed"". He said Gavin Williamson - sacked on Wednesday as defence secretary - had not been accused of a criminal offence, but had lost the PM's confidence. Mr Williamson strenuously denies being the source of the leak. He was sacked following an inquiry into the leak, which led to reports in the Daily Telegraph on plans to allow Chinese company Huawei to help build the UK's 5G network. Profile: Gavin Williamson How leaks and sources are used in politics Other times Gavin Williamson made the headlines Opposition MPs have said there should be an investigation into whether the Official Secrets Act had been breached. But Mr Lidington told the Commons: ""The prime minister has said she now considers that this matter has been closed and the cabinet secretary does not consider it necessary to refer it to the police. ""But we would of course co-operate fully should the police themselves consider that an investigation were necessary."" Although it's usually up to the police to decide whether to launch criminal investigations, alleged leaks of government information are dealt with differently. After 2008, when Scotland Yard became embroiled in a huge row over an inquiry into Home Office leaks, which resulted in the arrest of MP Damian Green, strict procedures were put in place. The guidelines suggest leaks should be investigated within Whitehall first and referred to police only if there's evidence of a serious crime or an offence under the Official Secrets Act. The threshold for police involvement is ""high"" and the ""proportionality"", ""likely outcomes"" and other ways of ""resolving"" the issue must be considered. Even if the Metropolitan Police, the lead force on leaks inquiries, was to become involved, it would first have to assess the allegations and liaise with legal experts before deciding whether and how to investigate. Given other demands facing the force, and its troubled history of examining alleged wrongdoing by ministers and MPs, a politically charged leaks investigation is the last thing it needs. Mr Lidington said the prime minister was ""the ultimate judge of the standards of behaviour expected of a minister"". He said ministers should ""shut up"" after National Security Council and cabinet meetings, appearing to echo Mr Williamson's wordswhen he told Russia to ""go away and shut up""soon into his job as defence secretary. Mr Lidington said Mr Williamson had ""not been accused of any criminal offence"" but had ""lost the confidence of the prime minister"", who by sacking him ""acted within the ministerial code"". This video can not be played Lidington: Ministers should 'shut up' outside cabinet Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt, speaking during a visit to Ethiopia, said it was a ""very, very important principle of our system"" that police, rather than politicians, decide whether to investigate further. But Labour deputy leader Tom Watson, who called for a police investigation, said: ""In response to receiving the most brutal sacking I can think of, (Mr Williamson) has protested his innocence. ""Therefore this matter cannot be, as the prime minister says, closed."" Conservative MP Sir Desmond Swayne argued the process had not been fair, saying: ""Natural justice requires that the evidence is produced so that [Mr Williamson's] reputation can be salvaged or utterly destroyed, doesn't it?"" Before Mr Lidington made his statement to the Commons, his parliamentary private secretary was photographed holding a document - seemingly intended to be hidden from view - stating that the prime minister's decision ""does not affect"" Mr Williamson'smembership of the Privy Council. The body, whose members are referred to as ""right honourable"", is made up of about 600 people, including past and present cabinet ministers. Meanwhile, Metropolitan Police Commissioner Cressida Dick said the force would ""look at any complaint"" made regarding the leak, but it had received no referral from the Cabinet Office. She said there was a ""formal process"" for dealing with alleged breaches of Official Secrets Act and police needed a referral. Disclosure of official information relating to security and intelligence by a ""Crown servant"" - including government ministers - can be illegal. For it to be an offence the disclosure has to be damaging and done without lawful authority (ie not as part of the person's official duties). Being found guilty of this carries a sentence ranging from a fine to two years in prison. If the police were to launch an investigation, the Attorney General Geoffrey Cox would decide whether there was to be a prosecution. Read more: What is the Official Secrets Act? An inquiry into the leak began after the Daily Telegraph reported on the council's confidential discussions - including warnings from several cabinet members about possible risks to national security over a deal with Huawei. At a meeting with Mr Williamson on Wednesday evening, Theresa May told him she had information that suggested he was responsible for the unauthorised disclosure. In aletter confirming his dismissal,she said: ""No other credible version of events to explain this leak has been identified."" This video can not be played On Tuesday, before he was sacked by Theresa May, Gavin Williamson said in a BBC interview that he had never leaked anything from the NSC In response, Mr Williamson - defence secretary since 2017 - wrote he was ""confident"" that a ""thorough and formal inquiry"" would have ""vindicated"" his position. ""I appreciate you offering me the option to resign, but to resign would have been to accept that I, my civil servants, my military advisers or my staff were responsible: this was not the case,"" he said. BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg said sources close to the former defence secretary had told her Mr Williamson talked to Daily Telegraph's deputy political editor, Steven Swinford, but ""that absolutely does not prove"" he leaked the story to him. Brexitcast becomes leakcast: My way or the Huawei Penny Mordaunt: UK's first female defence secretary Huawei: The story of a controversial company The National Security Council is made up of senior cabinet ministers and its weekly meetings are chaired by the prime minister, with other ministers, officials and senior figures from the armed forces and intelligence agencies invited when needed. It is a forum where secret intelligence can be shared by GCHQ, MI6 and MI5 with ministers, all of whom have signed the Official Secrets Act. There has been no formal confirmation of Huawei's role in the 5G network and No 10 said a final decision would be made at the end of spring. The US has been campaigning hard among allies to exclude the Chinese telecoms giant Huawei from delivering 5G, because of its security concerns. Huawei has denied there is any risk of spying or sabotage, or that it is controlled by the Chinese government.

"Gavin Williamson has been sacked as defence secretary for allegedly disclosing plans to allow Chinese telecoms giant Huawei to help build the UK's 5G mobile internet network. Mr Williamson has strenuously denied he leaked the information from the National Security Council. Following the dismissal, some MPs have questioned whether the Official Secrets Act has been breached and now want a police investigation. So how does the law work and what are the penalties? The law was first created in 1911 and updated in 1989. A person can be guilty of an offence if they make a ""damaging disclosure of any information or document,external"" relating to security or intelligence of which they are in possession. The law is strictest for those working for the security and intelligence services, past and present. Any unauthorised disclosure - under any circumstances - is a criminal offence. But the rules are different for Crown servants (for example, civil servants, government ministers, the armed forces or police). In these cases, a person is only guilty of an offence if the leaked information falls into one of the following categories and is deemed ""damaging"". Security and intelligence Defence International relations Information which might lead to a crime Foreign confidences Investigations under the Communications Act 1985 and Security Service Act 1989 A person does not have to officially ""sign"" the Official Secrets Act to be bound by it. The 1989 Act states that a person can simply be ""notified"" that it applies to them. For example, it might be stated in a government employee's contract that the Act applies to them when they start work. Theresa May said the leak was ""a very serious matter"" in her letter to Mr Williamson Following Mr Williamson's sacking, the Liberal Democrat deputy leader, Jo Swinson, wrote to the Metropolitan Police Commissioner, Cressida Dick, calling for a criminal investigation. Ms Dick says the Met will ""look at any complaint"", but adds the force has not received any referral from the Cabinet Office. The force says it needs a referral and to see material before it can decide whether to carry out an investigation. Whether or not a disclosure is deemed ""damaging"" is a decision for the attorney general. Any prosecution, under the 1989 Act, has to be done with their consent. If the police do decide to investigate, they would aim to determine the nature of the leaked information and who did it. But No 10 appears to want to draw a line under it. A spokesman said it ""considers the matter closed"". Williamson denies security council leak Profile Gavin Williamson May's letter in full sacking Williamson Prosecutions under the Official Secrets Act are very rare - about one a year - according to the House of the Commons Library. But over the years, there have been some high-profile cases. In 1983, civil servant Sarah Tisdall gave documents to The Guardian which gave the arrival date of missiles to an RAF base. She was given a six-month sentence. In 2002, MI5 agent David Shaylerwas jailed for six months for giving information to the Mail on Sunday.,external In 2007, Scotland Yardcivilian police worker Thomas Lund-Lack gave information to a Sunday Times journalist,externalon planned al-Qaeda attacks in Great Britain and the West. His disclosure resulted in an eight-month sentence. The maximum penalty for an unauthorised disclosure under the Act is two years' imprisonment or an unlimited fine, or both.

"Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson has been sacked by the prime minister after information from a National Security Council meeting was leaked to a newspaper. Here is Theresa May's full letter dismissing him. ""Dear Gavin, Thank you for your time this evening. We discussed the investigation into the unauthorised disclosure of information from the National Security Council meeting on 23 April. This is an extremely serious matter, and a deeply disappointing one. It is vital for the operation of good government and for the UK's national interest in some of the most sensitive and important areas that the members of the NSC - from our Armed Forces, our Security and Intelligence Agencies, and the most senior level of government - are able to have frank and detailed discussions in full confidence that the advice and analysis provided is not discussed or divulged beyond that trusted environment. That is why I commissioned the cabinet secretary to establish an investigation into the unprecedented leak from the NSC meeting last week, and why I expected everyone connected to it - ministers and officials alike - to comply with it fully. You undertook to do so. I am therefore concerned by the manner in which you have engaged with this investigation. It has been conducted fairly, with the full co-operation of other NSC attendees. They have all answered questions, engaged properly, provided as much information as possible to assist with the investigation, and encouraged their staff to do the same. Your conduct has not been of the same standard as others. In our meeting this evening, I put to you the latest information from the investigation, which provides compelling evidence suggesting your responsibility for the unauthorised disclosure. No other credible version of events to explain this leak has been identified. It is vital that I have full confidence in the members of my cabinet and of the National Security Council. The gravity of this issue alone, and its ramifications for the operation of the NSC and the UK's national interest, warrants the serious steps we have taken, and an equally serious response. It is therefore with great sadness that I have concluded that I can no longer have full confidence in you as secretary of state for defence and a minister in my cabinet and asked you to leave Her Majesty's government. As you do so, I would like to thank you for the wider contribution you have made to it over the last three years, and for your unquestionable personal commitment to the men and women of our Armed Forces."" ""Dear Prime Minister, It has been a great privilege to serve as Defence Secretary and Chief Whip in your government. Every day I have seen the extraordinary work of the men and women of our armed forces, who go to incredible lengths to defend our country. I am sorry that you feel recent leaks from the National Security Council originated in my department. I emphatically believe this was not the case. I strenuously deny that I was in any way involved in this leak and I am confident that a thorough and formal inquiry would have vindicated my position. I have always trusted my civil servants, military advisers and staff. I believe the assurances they have given me. I appreciate you offering me the option to resign, but to resign would have been to accept that I, my civil servants, my military advisers or my staff were responsible: this was not the case. Restoring public confidence in the NSC is an ambition we both share. With that in mind I hope that your decision achieves this aim rather than being seen as a temporary distraction. As I said there has been no greater privilege than working with our armed forces and I will continue to stand up for our service personnel and the superb work they do.""

"The polls have just closed. A phrase we're perhaps quite accustomed to these days. All day, voters in many parts of England and in Northern Ireland have been casting their ballots, expressing their views on the politicians who had put themselves up for scrutiny, stepping forward for the chance to be part of important decisions about our communities - on housing, the transport we use, the care provided to the youngest and oldest in our society. Each and every area will have its own many stories, each of us our own motivations for which box, or none, we tick. What happens in towns, villages and cities, and the decisions made by town halls and councillors has a huge bearing, of course, on these results. These elections are not taking place everywhere, so the results can't and won't give us a complete geographical picture. Turnout tends to be low in council elections, so in that sense too, the results are not representative of the whole voting public in the same way as a general election, where many millions more of us take part. Not all of the parties are even standing. Neither of the two new arrivals, Change UK and the Brexit Party, are taking part. Latest updates What's at stake and how to tell how the parties are doing Live results And quite fittingly in a country like ours, there are plenty of quirks. In one Surrey borough for example, the residents' association party has held control for years and years and anyone else can pretty much forget their chances of getting a look in. In Cheshire West and Chester, the kind of area where general elections are traditionally won and lost, the lines of the map have been redrawn this time round, so it's still a fight between Labour and the Tories, but in a different way. Whatever happens in the next 24 hours as the results emerge, bear in mind that the results of these local elections are not a beautifully clear, let alone reliable, crystal ball that will reveal the future. But these contests are an enormous set of elections, much bigger than the normal set of local ballots, and an important chance to test how the craziness of our national politics right now is going down with the public. Polling matters of course, and goodness knows, there is plenty of that about. Recent surveys are certainly not pretty reading for the government, nor do they suggest their main opponents, Labour, streaking ahead. They are a useful but only hypothetical guide to the currents of the public's thinking. Real votes in real elections are what count, and tonight's a real chance to get a flavour of what the Great British voting public really thinks. We'll be on air as the results come in overnight, on BBC One and BBC News, with loads of coverage online too.

"Windsor and Maidenhead are selecting their councillors, and Finn the cocker spaniel ""wanted to show his snout at the polling station"" It is that time of year when our canine friends take centre stage. As voters in England and Northern Ireland go to the polls our dogs often join us for the walk and, sometimes, a photo opportunity. Elections are being held for 248 English councils, six mayors and all 11 councils in Northern Ireland. There are no local elections in Scotland and Wales. How the BBC reports polling day Voting in local elections in England and NI Since the polls opened at 07:00 BST many a dog has been snapped outside a polling station and, as has been popular on polling days over recent years, shared across social media.

"Voters have delivered a stinging rebuke to the two main parties at Westminster in the local elections in England, with ballots still being counted in Northern Ireland.

By-elections can take place in some council wards even if that council is not scheduled for elections this year. Check your council website for details. Click or tap here if you cannot see the map.,external With all the results declared in England the Conservatives have lost over 1,300 councillors while Labour has also seen dozens of losses. The Lib Dems and Greens have both made significant gains, with the Lib Dems gaining more than 700 councillors and the Greens nearly 200. Independent candidates have also made unusually large gains, as shown by the rise of ""Others"" in the above chart. Professor Sir John Curtice has calculated how Thursday's vote would translate across Britain. This projection of the national vote share puts Labour and the Conservatives both on 28%. The Lib Dems were the big winners in terms of councils, taking over 10, seven of which were at the expense of the Conservatives. Their most impressive victory was inChelmsfordwhere they flipped a majority of 23. The Conservatives saw big losses in the south west, particularly the new councils ofBournemouth, Christchurch & PooleandSomerset West & Taunton. Labour suffered its biggest loss inAshfield, where it lost 20 councillors and the control of the council passed to Independents. Labour won seats in many parts of the country, and the party's largest gain was 16 councillors in the former UKIP stronghold ofThanet. The Conservatives' largest gain was inNorth East Derbyshire. Support for the major parties fell more heavily in their heartlands, according toProf Curtice, with Tories losing most seats in the south of England and Labour in the north. The Green Party were one of the beneficiaries of the main parties' misfortune, gaining nearly 200 new councillors across the country and only failing to defend seats in two areas. Meanwhile, UKIP lost councillors in many areas. The biggest loss came in their old heartland ofThanet, where former-leader Nigel Farage campaigned unsuccessfully to become an MP in 2015.

"This video can not be played Theresa May on local election results: ""Simple message... just get on and deliver Brexit"" The Conservatives have lost 1,334 councillors, with Theresa May saying voters wanted the main parties to ""get on"" with Brexit. Labour also lost 82 seats in the English local elections, in which it had been expected to make gains. But the strongly pro-EU Lib Dems gained 703 seats, with leader Sir Vince Cable calling every vote received ""a vote for stopping Brexit"". The Greens and independents also made gains, as UKIP lost seats. LIVE: Local election results and reaction Watson: Why is Labour losing seats? Election results in maps May predicts 'bright future' after Brexit Local elections: The main parties punished All 248 English councils holding elections have now announced their full results. While the scale of the Conservative election losses is larger than expected, Labour had predicted it would gain seats, having suffered losses the last time these council seats were contested, in 2015. The Green Party has added 194 councillors, while the number of independent councillors has risen by 612. UKIP, which enjoyed large gains in 2015, lost 145 seats. Results fromNorthern Ireland's 11 councils are also being announced. No local elections are taking place in Scotland and Wales. After nine years in government it's not surprising that the Conservatives have lost a significant chunk of seats. But the sheer number that have disappeared and the loss of control of authorities will hurt - especially with so many activists identifying Theresa May's handling of Brexit as a root of the problem, not just a general malaise. The perceived personal nature of the failure is more of an indignity than an encounter with a heckler in tweeds. And for Jeremy Corbyn, it is surprising and disappointing that Labour has simply failed to make any significant capital from such a divided and chaotic government. However ardently his devotees swear loyalty, the party has fallen back - on this set of results at least - seeming further, rather than closer, from winning power in a general election he so often claims to crave. Read more from Laura here. MPs have yet to agree on a deal for leaving the European Union, and, as a result,the deadline of Brexit has been pushed back from 29 March to 31 October. While local elections give voters the chance to choose the decision-makers who affect their communities, the national issue has loomed large on the doorstep. Mrs May, appearing at the Welsh Conservative conference, said voters had sent the ""simple message"" that her party and Labour had to ""get on"" with delivering Brexit. ""These were always going to be difficult elections for us,"" the prime minister added, ""and there were some challenging results for us last night, but it was a bad night for Labour, too."" A heckler shouted at the prime minister: ""Why don't you resign?"" He was then ushered out of the conference hall in Llangollen, North Wales, as the audience chanted: ""Out, out, out."" This video can not be played Vince Cable: Lib Dems are ""success story of the night"" BBC political correspondent Iain Watson said that while the Conservatives had lost ""more than 10 times as many councillors"", it was ""remarkable"" that Labour, ""around the mid-term of a not-very-popular government - has not made net gains"". Speaking in Greater Manchester, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said he ""wanted to do better"" and conceded voters who disagreed with its backing for Brexit had deserted the party. But Lib Dem leader Sir Vince, attending a rally in Chelmsford, Essex, where his party took control of the council, said it had been a ""brilliant"" result and that ""every vote for the Liberal Democrats was a vote for stopping Brexit"". This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn reacts to local election results after Labour suffers losses The BBC projects that, if the local election results it analysed were replicated across Britain, both the Conservatives and Labour would get 28% of the total vote. The data, based on 650 wards in which detailed voting figures were collected, suggests the Lib Dems would get 19% and other parties and independents 25%. Conservatives: 93 (-44) Labour: 60 (-6) Lib Dem: 18 (+10) Independent: 2 (+2) Residents' associations: 2 (+1) No overall control: 73 (+37) Polling expert Prof Sir John Curtice said the days of the Conservatives and Labour dominating the electoral landscape, as happened in the 2017 election when they won 80% of the vote between them, ""may be over"". He said it was only the second time in history that the two main parties' projected national share of the vote had fallen below 30%. The only other occasion was in 2013, when UKIP performed strongly in local elections. Prof Curtice also said the Conservatives and Labour had both lost ground since last year's local elections when both were estimated to be on 35%. While the Lib Dem figure was the highest since 2010, when they agreed to join the coalition government with the Conservatives, he said it was still well below the 24% the party regularly achieved in the 1990s and 2000s. Green Party co-leader Sian Berry told the BBC the Greens were not simply benefiting from a protest vote over Brexit - their gains reflected ""huge new concerns"" about climate change as well as the strength of their local campaigning on a range of issues. For UKIP, Lawrence Webb, a former London mayoral candidate who is standing in this month's European elections, said the party's ""fortunes were on the up"", despite the fall in its number of councillors. MP weeps as Tories lose comfortable majority Independents celebrate council gains Actor Sir Tony Robinson quits Labour This is the biggest set of local elections in England's four-year electoral cycle, with more than 8,400 seats being contested. A further 462 seats are up for grabs in Northern Ireland. Six mayoral elections have also taken place, with Labour's Jamie Driscoll winning the contest to become the first ever North of Tyne mayor. Labour candidates also won in Leicester and Mansfield but the party out lost to independents in Middlesbrough and Copeland.

Here's a recap of what's happened: You can read a full breakdown of all the results here.  The Daily Express says voters vented their anger at the local elections, sending a clear message to politicians to deliver Brexit. The Guardian says Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn are seeking a cross-party solution to the Brexit deadlock after voters punished both major parties in local elections. The Times claims Theresa May will be told by senior Tories that she must set her departure date next week after the party's drubbing in the local elections. The Daily Telegraph says the Conservatives suffered their worst local election result since ""Tony Blair's humiliation of John Major a quarter of a century ago"". The Daily Mail and the Independent have similar headlines but have interpreted the local election results in very different ways. The Daily Mail says Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn suffered humiliation amid protests over failing to deliver Brexit. The Independent, however, says voters turned to parties backing another referendum on Brexit. The iweekend carries a warning from Home Secretary Sajid Javid, who says that voters will punish his ""divided party"" for breaking trust. The Andrew Marr Show Andrew Marr's guests this weekend to look at the local election results will include shadow chancellor John McDonnell, Scottish Tory leader Ruth Davidson, Green Party co-leader Sian Berry and Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price. Reviewing the Sunday papers will be Amanda Platell and Steve Richards on the Marr Show from 10:00 BST on Sunday. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

With the results for Waverley and Mansfield now in, every council in England has declared. The Conervatives have suffered huge defeats, losing more than 1,300 councillors and 44 councils. And Labour, who had been expected to make gains, instead lost 81 councillors and six councils. Theresa May has said the results show the public want both parties to ""get on"" with Brexit. But the strongly pro-EU Lib Dems gained 700 seats, with leader Sir Vince Cable calling every vote received ""a vote for stopping Brexit"". The Green Party - who are also pro-EU - have picked up an additional 194 seats in comparison to 2015. You can read a full breakdown of all the results here. Antrim and Newtownabbey Borough Council DUP MP Gavin Robinson says it is a ""good news story"" for his party that Allison Bennington has been elected as a councillor. She is the first openly gay candidate to stand for the party. Mr Robinson said: ""If you believe in our party's principles, if you stand for our values, if you are prepared to go forward and seek selection and you are selected and elected by the people - then get on and do the job."" He added: ""We're not a theocracy, we're a political party."" Unsurprisingly, the Guardian focuses on the Conservatives' huge losses, which it says are the party's worst for almost a quarter of a century.

"This video can not be played A guide to voting in the local elections The polls have closed in the elections for 462 new members of Northern Ireland's 11 district councils. Earlier the Electoral Office described voting as ""steady"". A total of 819 candidates were standing. Polling stations opened at 07:00 BST and closed at 22:00 BST in the proportional representation election. Turnout reports from polling stations at 17:00 BST ranged from a low of 15% in east Belfast to as high as 36% in one venue in the north of the city. The final turnout in the last council elections five years ago was just over 51%. Full lists of the candidates standing in each council areacan be found on the Electoral Office's website,external. A total of 1,305,553 people were eligible to vote. How the BBC reports polling day The single transferable vote (STV) system is used in council elections, in which voters rank candidates by numerical preference. Voters marked their ballot with 1, 2, 3 and so on and could indicate as many or as few preferences as they wanted. Voters will decide who takes the 462 seats that are available across 11 councils Candidates are then elected according to the share of the vote they receive. By Mark Devenport, BBC News NI Political Editor In advance of this election there had been some concern expressed that the turnout might be down, perhaps due to public disenchantment with politics, perhaps because for the first time in more than two decades these council elections were not happening in tandem with another contest. In the event the good weather seems to have brought the voters out in force, with reports of people having to queue to get into some polling stations. So it may be we will match the turnout in the last council election five years ago, which was 51%. Counting begins in the morning, and results will start to be declared during the afternoon. But the full makeup of our new councils won't be clear until Saturday.

"Trans woman Stephanie Hayden claimed a Catholic journalist harassed her in a series of tweets A judge has told a transgender lawyer and a Catholic journalist involved in an  ""out of control"" Twitter row not to mention each other online. Trans woman Stephanie Hayden has been granted an injunction against Caroline Farrow after a ""barrage"" of tweets. At a High Court hearing in London, Mr Justice Bryan also asked Ms Hayden to not mention Mrs Farrow, and she agreed. The judge said tweets sent by mother-of-five Mrs Farrow, whose husband is a priest, had ""crossed the line"". An interim injunction bans Mrs Farrow from mentioning Ms Hayden, in particular from ""misgendering"" her, by referring to her as male when she is legally female. The judge said: ""The tweetingâ¦ has got out of control.  Each have said things in those tweets which, in the cold light of day in this court, I would anticipate they would rather wish they had not done."" Representing herself, Ms Hayden told the judge the debate with Mrs Farrow had been going on since January. She claimed Mrs Farrow harassed her in a series of tweets, suggesting she was violent, misgendering her and posting a photograph of her. Mrs Farrow denied this and her lawyers argued she had been subjected to ""a positive avalanche of abuse over a number of months"" from Ms Hayden. The two have previously been involved in Twitter rows over similar issues, the court heard. Mrs Farrow was investigated by policeafter the founder of transgender support charity Mermaids, Susie Green, accused the commentator of misgendering her daughter on Twitter. Ms Green later withdrew the complaint and Surrey Police announced in March they would take no further action.

"This video can not be played The drone had to be custom-built A donor kidney has been delivered to surgeons at a US hospital via drone, in the first flight of its kind. Many see huge potential for unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) delivering medical products, with some drones already doing so in Africa. The US flight required a specially-designed drone which was able to maintain and monitor the organ. It is hoped that it can pave the way for longer flights and address safety issue with current transport methods. The recipient, a 44-year-old from Baltimore, had waited eight years for the transplant. She said of the unusual delivery method: ""This whole thing is amazing. Years ago, this was not something that you would think about."" According to the United Network for Organ Sharing, which manages organ transplants in the US, in 2018 there were nearly 114,000 people on waiting lists, with 1.5% of organs not making it to the destination and nearly 4% being delayed by two hours or more. The drone took off at night ""Delivering an organ from a donor to a patient is a sacred duty with many moving parts. It is critical that we find ways of doing this better,"" said Joseph Scalea, assistant professor of surgery at University of Maryland School of Medicine (UMSOM), and one of the surgeons who performed the transplant. ""As a result of the outstanding collaboration among surgeons, engineers, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), organ procurement specialists, pilots, nurses, and, ultimately, the patient, we were able to make a pioneering breakthrough in transplantation."" The three-mile journey required a lot of new technology, including a custom-made drone capable of carrying the additional weight of an organ, which also needed on-board cameras and organ tracking, and communications and safety systems for a flight over an urban, densely-populated area. It also had a parachute recovery system in case the aircraft failed. The drone's mission was a success and the patient has now left hospital ""There's a tremendous amount of pressure knowing there's a person waiting for that organ, but it's also a special privilege to be a part of this critical mission,"" said Matthew Scassero, part of the engineering team based at the University of Maryland. Charlie Alexander, chief executive of The Living Legacy Foundation of Maryland, a charity working to increase organ donation, said: ""If we can prove that this works, then we can look at much greater distances of unmanned organ transport. ""This would minimise the need for multiple pilots and flight time and address safety issues we have in our field.""

"The government does not think it necessary to refer the National Security Council leak to the police, the PM's de facto deputy says. Responding to calls from MPs for a police inquiry, David Lidington said the PM considered the matter ""closed"". He said Gavin Williamson - sacked on Wednesday as defence secretary - had not been accused of a criminal offence, but had lost the PM's confidence. Mr Williamson strenuously denies being the source of the leak. He was sacked following an inquiry into the leak, which led to reports in the Daily Telegraph on plans to allow Chinese company Huawei to help build the UK's 5G network. Profile: Gavin Williamson How leaks and sources are used in politics Other times Gavin Williamson made the headlines Opposition MPs have said there should be an investigation into whether the Official Secrets Act had been breached. But Mr Lidington told the Commons: ""The prime minister has said she now considers that this matter has been closed and the cabinet secretary does not consider it necessary to refer it to the police. ""But we would of course co-operate fully should the police themselves consider that an investigation were necessary."" Although it's usually up to the police to decide whether to launch criminal investigations, alleged leaks of government information are dealt with differently. After 2008, when Scotland Yard became embroiled in a huge row over an inquiry into Home Office leaks, which resulted in the arrest of MP Damian Green, strict procedures were put in place. The guidelines suggest leaks should be investigated within Whitehall first and referred to police only if there's evidence of a serious crime or an offence under the Official Secrets Act. The threshold for police involvement is ""high"" and the ""proportionality"", ""likely outcomes"" and other ways of ""resolving"" the issue must be considered. Even if the Metropolitan Police, the lead force on leaks inquiries, was to become involved, it would first have to assess the allegations and liaise with legal experts before deciding whether and how to investigate. Given other demands facing the force, and its troubled history of examining alleged wrongdoing by ministers and MPs, a politically charged leaks investigation is the last thing it needs. Mr Lidington said the prime minister was ""the ultimate judge of the standards of behaviour expected of a minister"". He said ministers should ""shut up"" after National Security Council and cabinet meetings, appearing to echo Mr Williamson's wordswhen he told Russia to ""go away and shut up""soon into his job as defence secretary. Mr Lidington said Mr Williamson had ""not been accused of any criminal offence"" but had ""lost the confidence of the prime minister"", who by sacking him ""acted within the ministerial code"". This video can not be played Lidington: Ministers should 'shut up' outside cabinet Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt, speaking during a visit to Ethiopia, said it was a ""very, very important principle of our system"" that police, rather than politicians, decide whether to investigate further. But Labour deputy leader Tom Watson, who called for a police investigation, said: ""In response to receiving the most brutal sacking I can think of, (Mr Williamson) has protested his innocence. ""Therefore this matter cannot be, as the prime minister says, closed."" Conservative MP Sir Desmond Swayne argued the process had not been fair, saying: ""Natural justice requires that the evidence is produced so that [Mr Williamson's] reputation can be salvaged or utterly destroyed, doesn't it?"" Before Mr Lidington made his statement to the Commons, his parliamentary private secretary was photographed holding a document - seemingly intended to be hidden from view - stating that the prime minister's decision ""does not affect"" Mr Williamson'smembership of the Privy Council. The body, whose members are referred to as ""right honourable"", is made up of about 600 people, including past and present cabinet ministers. Meanwhile, Metropolitan Police Commissioner Cressida Dick said the force would ""look at any complaint"" made regarding the leak, but it had received no referral from the Cabinet Office. She said there was a ""formal process"" for dealing with alleged breaches of Official Secrets Act and police needed a referral. Disclosure of official information relating to security and intelligence by a ""Crown servant"" - including government ministers - can be illegal. For it to be an offence the disclosure has to be damaging and done without lawful authority (ie not as part of the person's official duties). Being found guilty of this carries a sentence ranging from a fine to two years in prison. If the police were to launch an investigation, the Attorney General Geoffrey Cox would decide whether there was to be a prosecution. Read more: What is the Official Secrets Act? An inquiry into the leak began after the Daily Telegraph reported on the council's confidential discussions - including warnings from several cabinet members about possible risks to national security over a deal with Huawei. At a meeting with Mr Williamson on Wednesday evening, Theresa May told him she had information that suggested he was responsible for the unauthorised disclosure. In aletter confirming his dismissal,she said: ""No other credible version of events to explain this leak has been identified."" This video can not be played On Tuesday, before he was sacked by Theresa May, Gavin Williamson said in a BBC interview that he had never leaked anything from the NSC In response, Mr Williamson - defence secretary since 2017 - wrote he was ""confident"" that a ""thorough and formal inquiry"" would have ""vindicated"" his position. ""I appreciate you offering me the option to resign, but to resign would have been to accept that I, my civil servants, my military advisers or my staff were responsible: this was not the case,"" he said. BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg said sources close to the former defence secretary had told her Mr Williamson talked to Daily Telegraph's deputy political editor, Steven Swinford, but ""that absolutely does not prove"" he leaked the story to him.

"Elections are held for 248 English councils, six mayors and all 11 councils in Northern Ireland Conservatives and Labour both see vote shares fall compared with 2015 The Tories lose 44 councils and 1,334 seats Theresa May says results message is: ""Just get on and deliver Brexit."" Labour loses six councils and 82 seats Lib Dems take control of 10 councils and won 703 seats Greens and independents also make significant gains Anger over Brexit appears to be influencing voters, say experts Arryn Moy and Hamish Mackay That's the end of our live coverage of the local election for now. Here's a recap of what's happened: You can read a full breakdown of all the results here.  The Daily Express says voters vented their anger at the local elections, sending a clear message to politicians to deliver Brexit. The Guardian says Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn are seeking a cross-party solution to the Brexit deadlock after voters punished both major parties in local elections. The Times claims Theresa May will be told by senior Tories that she must set her departure date next week after the party's drubbing in the local elections. The Daily Telegraph says the Conservatives suffered their worst local election result since ""Tony Blair's humiliation of John Major a quarter of a century ago"". The Daily Mail and the Independent have similar headlines but have interpreted the local election results in very different ways. The Daily Mail says Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn suffered humiliation amid protests over failing to deliver Brexit. The Independent, however, says voters turned to parties backing another referendum on Brexit. The iweekend carries a warning from Home Secretary Sajid Javid, who says that voters will punish his ""divided party"" for breaking trust. The Andrew Marr Show Andrew Marr's guests this weekend to look at the local election results will include shadow chancellor John McDonnell, Scottish Tory leader Ruth Davidson, Green Party co-leader Sian Berry and Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price. Reviewing the Sunday papers will be Amanda Platell and Steve Richards on the Marr Show from 10:00 BST on Sunday. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

With the results for Waverley and Mansfield now in, every council in England has declared. The Conervatives have suffered huge defeats, losing more than 1,300 councillors and 44 councils. And Labour, who had been expected to make gains, instead lost 81 councillors and six councils. Theresa May has said the results show the public want both parties to ""get on"" with Brexit. But the strongly pro-EU Lib Dems gained 700 seats, with leader Sir Vince Cable calling every vote received ""a vote for stopping Brexit"". The Green Party - who are also pro-EU - have picked up an additional 194 seats in comparison to 2015. You can read a full breakdown of all the results here. Antrim and Newtownabbey Borough Council DUP MP Gavin Robinson says it is a ""good news story"" for his party that Allison Bennington has been elected as a councillor. She is the first openly gay candidate to stand for the party. Mr Robinson said: ""If you believe in our party's principles, if you stand for our values, if you are prepared to go forward and seek selection and you are selected and elected by the people - then get on and do the job."" He added: ""We're not a theocracy, we're a political party."" Unsurprisingly, the Guardian focuses on the Conservatives' huge losses, which it says are the party's worst for almost a quarter of a century. It's worth noting that since that tweet was sent, their losses have reached 1,327 seats . Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"This video can not be played Beyond Meat boss Ethan Brown is not worried about the competition Shares of vegan burger maker Beyond Meat soared on their Wall Street debut as investors bet on the growing popularity of plant-based foods. The stock closed up 163% on the first day of trading, valuing the California company at close to $3.8bn. Beyond Meat's shares were priced at $25 each at the start of trading, but touched $72 during the trading day before closing at $65.75. The company has aggressive plans to expand sales outside the US. Money raised from the listing will give Beyond Meat the firepower to compete with other rivals in the increasingly crowded fake meat market, which includes Silicon Valley start-up Impossible Foods. Speaking at the stock market launch on the Nasdaq exchange, Beyond Meat founder and chief executive Ethan Brown called plant-based meat an ""enormous opportunity for economic growth in rural America and throughout the world"". He said: ""We understand the composition of meat, we understand the architecture and year after year we collapse the gaps between our product and animal protein."" Beyond Meat counts actor Leonardo DiCaprio and Microsoft founder Bill Gates among its investors. Tyson Foods, the biggest US meat processor, owned a 6.5% stake in Beyond Meat, but last week said it sold its holding, as it looks to develop its own line of alternative protein products. Burger King and Impossible Foods last month started selling their vegan burger Impossible Whopper in 59 stores in and around St. Louis, Missouri, with nationwide sales expected by the end of the year. Beyond Meat creates substitutes for meat by using ingredients that mimic the composition of animal-based meat, like proteins from peas, fava beans and soy. About 70% of the company's revenues are generated by its flagship Beyond Burger patties, and it also sells imitation sausages and vegan ground beef. Beyond Meat, which has yet to make a profit, has started selling products in the UK as more supermarkets fill their shelves with meat alternatives. Beyond Burger was originally due to be introduced in the UK at 350 Tesco stores last August, but that was delayed by three months because of supply issues. Waitrose started a dedicated vegan section in more than 130 shops last year and Iceland reported sales of its plant-based foods rising by 10% in a year. Research conducted by the Vegan Society in 2016 estimated there were around 540,000 vegans across the UK, compared with around 150,000 in 2006. In 2018, some $50m of Beyond Meat's revenues came from retail sales, including at Amazon's Whole Foods Market and Kroger Co supermarkets, while some $37m was generated at restaurants. According to regulatory documents ahead of the stock market debut, Beyond Meat's net loss narrowed marginally to $29.9m in the year ended 31 December, from $30.4m a year earlier. Net revenue more than doubled to $87.9m in the same period. Is plant burger firm really worth $1.5bn?

"Grassfires spread quickly, especially during the dry summer months Arsonists were responsible for a 75% spike in grassfires in the past year, new figures have shown. A total of 2,850 fires were started from April 2018 to March 2019, compared with 1,627 in the 12 months previously. Fire chiefs said these figures were ""very disappointing"", and attributed it tolast year's hot and dry summer. Wales' fire services have developed an educational programme in a bid to tackle the problem, resulting in 60,000 speeches to schoolchildren. Kelvin Griffiths, 65, a farmer from Carmel, Gwynedd, lost grazing land in a grassfire on Cilgwyn Mountain last year, which shares common land on Ywch Gwyrfai. ""There was a huge fire stretching for a mile long. I have cattle and sheep that graze there,"" he said. ""There are houses on the common nearby who were really worried."" Why are there wildfires in February? Animals caught in wildfires Lisa Jones - who lives nearby - took this picture of the fire in Carmel Operation Dawns Glaw,externalwas set up in 2016 to tackle deliberate grassfires, involving all three of Wales' fire services. The UK heatwave of 2018 - one of the driest and warmest summers in Wales since 1995 - also meant more fires. The operation's chairman Mydrian Harries said: ""Sadly in the last year we've seen that increase and predominantly attributed it to the hot weather in June, July and August. ""When the weather starts drying, any fire that commences does spread rapidly. ""Add to that some warm currents and prevailing winds and we do find the fire spreads rapidly. Unfortunately there's a sector out there who do see this as opportunities to burn."" Mr Harries said about 50% of all last year's grassfires were recorded as deliberate. ""While these statistics are very disappointing, they should not take away from the overall success of Operation Dawns Glaw,"" he said. Fire officers are also looking to tackle fly-tipping and countryside rubbish fires, which can spread to grassland, starting huge fires. Natural Resources Wales says land can take ""decades"" to recover from severe grassfires Land owners and farmers are allowed to do controlled burns on their land between October and March, but only if they have created a specific plan for starting and containing the fire. Anyone carrying out one of these burns outside of these months or without a plan is committing arson. However, Mr Griffiths believes thesestrict regulations,externalmean farmers' land becomes overgrown, making it more at risk of spreading grassfires. ""Now there are so many restrictions on burning, if you want to burn, you have to inform the police, create fire barriers and have an army of people,"" he said. ""It's not feasible. It overgrows and then it becomes a threat and cattle and sheep can't access the grazing. ""Once you ignite it just goes 'whoosh' and if there's a strong wind behind, it takes no time at all."" Mid and West Wales Fire and Rescue Service said it was not its legislation to police. A spokesman said: ""What we're doing with the Welsh government and partners in Dawns Glaw is to tell people to burn within the prescribed periods."" The Welsh Government said it was ""irresponsible"" to set a fire in open land ""without proper controls and safeguards, or outside the permitted season"". ""Such fires can very easily spread out of control, for example if the wind strengthens or changes direction, and can take days or even weeks to extinguish, especially if they spread into peat,"" a spokesman said. ""This in turn ties up fire crews who might well be needed to attend other incidents. The regulations are designed to greatly reduce these risks.""

"Julian Assange pumped his fist at photographers as he arrived at Southwark Crown Court on Wednesday Wikileaks co-founder Julian Assange has said he does not consent to being extradited to the US over charges related to leaking government secrets. His extradition hearing came a day after he wassentenced to 50 weeks in jailfor breaching the Bail Act following his arrest last month. The 47-year-old appeared by video link at Westminster Magistrates' Court. The court heard that the ""extradition process will take many months"". The case was adjourned until 30 May. Assange told the court: ""I do not wish to surrender myself for extradition for doing journalism that has won many awards and protected many people."" Outside the court dozens of his supporters, many holding posters and banners demanding his freedom, blocked the road in protest. Assange took refuge in Ecuador's London embassy in 2012 to avoid extradition to Sweden over sexual assault allegations, which he has denied.

"Adam Price said Wales ""doesn't matter one bit"" in Westminster's corridors of power European elections are a chance to draw a line under ""grief"" over the current ""lack of leadership in politics"", Plaid Cymru's leader has said. Launching the party's campaign, Adam Price urged anyone in Wales wanting another EU poll to back Plaid Cymru. He said the party was targeting Welsh Labour voters who felt let down on Brexit. Plaid was the only Welsh party ""with a chance of winning seats"" unequivocally  backing a further referendum, he said. Plaid says Wales should hold an independence referendum if Brexit occurs without a further EU referendum. Last Friday's announcementby Mr Price on an independence vote went further than hisparty conference speechin March. Farage launches Brexit Party campaign EU elections: Labour calls for Brexit poll List of candidates for Wales At the Plaid Cymru campaign launch for the European election in Cardiff on Thursday, Mr Price said thousand of Labour supporters across Wales were living in a ""state of permanent despair"". European elections, on 23 May, offered a chance to draw a line ""under your grief"" over the ""lack of leadership in politics in general at the moment"", he said. ""These elections are a bridge across which thousands of people can venture to make the change that Wales needs,"" he said. ""If we want a European future for Wales we have to vote for Plaid Cymru - the only party that unequivocally in that future."" A vote for Plaid Cymru was ""our chance"" to ""make Wales matter in Europe and the world"" he said. ""We know that Wales matters. Wales matters to millions of our people, in their daily lives. But in the corridors of power in Westminster it doesn't matter one bit. ""This election is not just about putting Wales - our lives, our problems and our dreams - at the heart of Europe, but bringing in Wales from the margins, out from the cold."" Lead Plaid candidate Jill Evans said Wales needs a voice in Europe ""more than ever"" Plaid has previously said that a cross-party deal between anti-Brexit parties ""could have been an opportunity to offer the voters the clearest possible choice at the ballot box"" andblamed the Greensin Wales for the two parties failing to work together in the European election. The Green Party has saidno approach,externalhad been made to it by other parties. In the last European Parliament election in 2014, the four Welsh seats were split between Plaid, Labour, UKIP and the Conservatives. Mr Price said: ""We are the only party in Wales with a chance of winning seats in the European Parliament that is unequivocally supporting a People's Vote. ""For that reason we are appealing for support across the parties. We are saying to progressive people across the political spectrum - join us. ""Our appeal is especially to [Welsh] Labour supporters who, for years, have been in a state of permanent disappointment with the leadership of their party."" Plaid Cymru's lead candidate, Jill Evans, first elected an MEP in 1999, said she was ""proud and thankful"" to be standing for a fifth time.

"Pentagon officials commemorate Sexual Assault Awareness and Prevention Month in March 2015 The US military has reported a major spike in sexual assaults despite years of efforts to address the problem. Figures show 20,500 instances of unwanted sexual contact occurred in 2018, up from 14,900 in 2016 which is the last time a survey was conducted. Alcohol was involved in one third of cases, and female recruits ages 17 to 24 are at the highest risk of attack. On Thursday, Acting Defence Secretary Patrick Shanahan directed the military to ""criminalise"" sexual harassment. Sexual harassment can fall within other legal violations of military behaviour, but is not yet a ""stand-alone"" criminal offence. The directive from Mr Shanahan was among a series of other recommendations, released in a memo on Thursday. ""Sexual assault is illegal and immoral, is inconsistent with the military's mission and will not be tolerated,"" he wrote. In the US, sexual harassment is illegal, considered a form of sexual discrimination under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, which also covers discrimination based on race, skin colour, religion and national origin. The report released on Thursday surveyed the Army, Navy, Air Force and Marines, and estimated a total of 20,500 cases in 2018. The total figure is based reports of attacks as well as an extrapolation of survey data which wasgathered through a poll,externalof over 100,000 troops. Researchers say the survey has a 95% level of confidence. Incidents of unwanted sexual contact - which ranges from groping to rape - rose by around 38% between 2016 and 2018. Only one out of three cases were reported to authorities, the report found. In 2006, only one in 14 victims reported sexual assault crimes, the Pentagon said. In a statement issued on Thursday, the Marines acknowledged they had ""historically viewed an increase in reporting as an indicator Marines feel more empowered to report more confident in the care victims receive"". ""However, with the number of estimated assaults rising, especially among our young Marines, the Marine Corps must evolve its prevention methods and continue to foster a climate and culture of dignity, respect and trust,"" the statement said. In more than 85% of cases, victims knew their attacker. The majority of cases involved young women whose attacker was often a superior officer. The report should be ""a trip wire"", said Nate Galbreath, Deputy Director of the Department' of Defense's Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Office. ""This is what tells us that there's something going on that we need to hone in on,"" he told ABC News. ""We've got a higher prevalence for women 17 to 24. We're going to be focusing very, very tightly on that."" US senator: Air Force officer raped me US marines in nude photo sharing scandal Gruelling test for female US marines Congresswoman Jackie Speier, who chairs the House Armed Services Committee's personnel panel, told the USA Today newspaper that the military ""must accept that current programmes are simply not working"". ""Congress must lead the way in forcing the department to take more aggressive approaches to fighting this scourge,"" she said, calling for intervention from US lawmakers. On Thursday, Mr Shanahan revealed some of the recommendations made by the Sexual Assault Accountability and Investigation Task Force, which was created last month after the urging of Senator Martha McSally. This video can not be played Senator Martha McSally: ""I was ashamed and confused"" Senator McSally, who was the first female US fighter pilot to fly in combat, revealed in March that she had been raped by a superior officer while serving in the Air Force. In response to the report, Mr Shanahan directed the US Department of Defence ""criminalise"" sexual harassment ""to combat this scourge"". He detailed prevention, accountability and support efforts in order to ""eliminate"" sexual assault, including new methods of identifying repeat offenders. ""We must, and will, do better,"" he wrote in the memo. It is unclear if he would need congressional approval to make changes to the Uniform Code of Military Justice - the US military's legal code, to make the offence a ""stand-alone crime"". In his memo, Mr Shanahan also announced plans to train commanders in a new programme to uncover serial sex offenders. ""To put it bluntly, we are not performing to the standards and expectations we have for ourselves or for each other,"" Mr Shanahan said. ""This is unacceptable. We cannot shrink from facing the challenge head on."" In a series of tweets, Gen Robert B. Neller, the highest ranking officer in the US Marine Corps, joined in condemning the behaviour captured by the study. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

According to the report, compared with the Navy, Army, Air force and Coast guard, the Marines had the highest rates of sexual assault throughout the US Armed Forces - sitting at 11%. ""Marines know that sexual assault is a crime,"" Gen Neller wrote. ""We are better than this."" Democratic Senator and 2020 presidential contender Kirsten Gillibrand also responded on Twitter, calling on Congress to take action where the defence department has ""repeatedly failed"". Sen Gillibrand has been an outspoken advocate of victims of sexual assault and has pressed for legislation to make it easier to prosecute sexual violence in the military. In her tweets, she cited a 2013 statement from the chairmen of the Joint Chiefs of Staff - the highest US military post - that called sexual assault in the military a ""crisis"".

"Nancy Pelosi says Attorney general William Barr ""lied to Congress"" US Speaker Nancy Pelosi has accused the Attorney General William Barr of lying to Congress. Her comments came a day after Mr Barr's testimony to a Senate panel about Special Counsel Robert Mueller's report on Russia's alleged meddling in 2016. Mr Barr faced sharp questioning about his decision to clear President Donald Trump of obstruction of justice. The top US law official refused to testify to Democratic-led House Judiciary Committee on Thursday. The stand-off raises the prospect that Mr Barr - America's top legal official - could be held in contempt of Congress. Five looming fights between Congress and Trump Trump 'tried to get Mueller fired' Eight new things in the Mueller report ""He lied to Congress. And if anybody else did that it would be considered a crime,"" Ms Pelosi said on Thursday. ""Nobody is above the law,"" she added. Ms Pelosi's accusation stems from Mr Barr saying he was not aware of any complaints Mr Mueller had about the attorney general's four-page summary of his report. Mr Mueller wrote a letterto Mr Barr saying the summary lacked ""context"". ""It wasn't about technicalities,"" Ms Pelosi told reporters. ""The attorney general of the United States of America was not telling the truth to the Congress of the United States. That's a crime."" Allow Twitter content?

""The baseless attack on the attorney general is reckless, irresponsible and false,"" spokeswoman Kerri Kupec said. Republicans also condemned the remarks. Senator Lindsey Graham told reporters it was an ""offensive statement"" and said Ms Pelosi should apologise. ""I think it says more about her than it does about Bill Barr,"" he added. In a press conference on Thursday morning, Nancy Pelosi directly accused William Barr of committing a crime. What are Democrats going to do about it? Ms Pelosi only made vague references to a ""process"", but they have several options if they want to punish the attorney general. They could make a criminal referral for lying to Congress, which would be forwarded to a US attorney in Mr Barr's justice department. They could hold Mr Barr in contempt of Congress, which would have to be enforced by US attorneys in the Trump administration. The House of Representatives could also vote to formally censure the attorney general, putting a black mark on his record but not much more. Finally, they could try to impeach the attorney general and have him removed from office. The process would be similar to that for removing a US president - a majority vote in the House of Representatives followed by a trial in the US Senate requiring a two-thirds vote to ""convict"". Only one cabinet official has ever been impeached - Ulysses S Grant's Secretary of War William Belknap in 1876 - and he was ultimately acquitted of corruption charges by the Senate. William Barr appeared before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Wednesdayand defended his handling of the Special Counsel's 448-page investigation. This video can not be played Why did the chicken go to Congress? It came after Mr Mueller's letter was released, revealing he had twice requested that Mr Barr give more information about the report's conclusions. But Mr Barr said the special counsel was not concerned with the accuracy of the summary and only with how it was being reported by media. ""My understanding was his concern was not the accuracy of the statement of the findings in my letter, but that he wanted more out there to provide additional context to explain his reasoning and why he didn't reach a decision on obstruction,"" he said. Mr Barr also declared he was ""absolutely"" confident in his own judgment that Mr Trump did not unlawfully attempt to impede the investigation. But Democratic Senator Mazie Hirono told the attorney general at Wednesday's hearing that he had betrayed a ""sacred trust"". This video can not be played Why no charge of obstruction of justice? A law professor breaks down the legal questions ""America deserves better. You should resign."" And a tweet showing Democratic Senator Kamala Harris questioning Mr Barr at Wednesday's hearing has now been viewed more than four million times. Allow Twitter content?

Republicans however defended Mr Barr, saying the issue of whether or not President Trump obstructed justice or colluded with the Russians had been settled. ""As far as I'm concerned, this is over,"" Senator John Kennedy tweeted. ""It's time to move on."" The attorney general was scheduled to appear before House Judiciary Committee on Thursday for further questioning about the Mueller probe, but failed to appear. There has been a growing call for Mr Barr to resign, including from numerous candidates for the Democratic Party's presidential nomination in the 2020 election. Ms Harris and her colleagues Senators Elizabeth Warren and Kirsten Gillibrand all called for him to step down on Twitter, as did former Texas congressman Beto O'Rourke. Democratic Committee chair Jerrold Nadler has threatened to hold Mr Barr in contempt of Congress after he missed a deadline to release the full Mueller report. ""We will make one more good-faith attempt to negotiate and to get the access to the report that we need, and then if we don't get that, we will proceed to hold the attorney general in contempt,"" he told reporters. In a more light-hearted display, Democratic congressman Steve Cohen brought a bucket of fried chicken and a chicken statue to the House Judiciary Committee hearing on Thursday, and left them in Mr Barr's vacant seat.

"This video can not be played Bombardier to sell NI operations The aerospace firm, Bombardier, is putting its Northern Ireland operation up for sale as part of a reorganisation of the business. The Canadian aircraft manufacturer employs about 3,600 people across several locations in Northern Ireland. The company said it would be working closely with employees and unions, through any future transition period. Unions said it caused ""uncertainty"" for workers at Northern Ireland's biggest manufacturing employer. How important is Bombardier to NI? 'Bombshell' as Bombardier cuts 490 NI jobs Unions consult over Bombardier action It is selling off its aerospace operations in Belfast, Newtownabbey, Newtownards and Dunmurry. The company's Moroccan operation is also being sold off. In a statement, Bombardier said it was consolidating all aerospace assets into a ""single, streamlined and fully integrated business"". ""As a result, Bombardier will pursue the divestiture of its Belfast and Morocco aerostructures businesses."",external The statement added: ""Our sites in Belfast and Morocco have seen a significant increase in work from other global customers in recent years. This video can not be played The history of Bombardier in Northern Ireland ""We are recognised as a global leader in aerostructures, with unique end-to-end capabilities - through design and development, testing and manufacture, to after-market support."" It said Bombardier was committed to finding the right buyer. It added: ""We understand that this announcement may cause concern among our employees, but we will be working closely with them and our unions as matters progress, and through any future transition period to a new owner. ""There are no new workforce announcements as a result of this decision."" Last November, Bombardier said it was to cut a further 490 jobs from its Northern Ireland operations. Business Secretary Greg Clark spoke to representatives of the company before the announcement was made. ""The Belfast plant is one of our most important aerospace facilities in the country and a vital asset in the UK's leading aerospace sector,"" he said in a statement. ""The government will work with potential buyers to take this successful and ambitious business forward."" Speaking on BBC News NI's Talkback programme, Gavin Robinson, MP for East Belfast, said that, in recent years, Bombardier workers have not been able to ""get a break"". He said that ""government has a role to ensure that all avenues are explored"" in relation to the sale. Analysis: John Campbell, BBC News NI economics and business editor It is not yet clear who could buy the Belfast operation but it may be attractive to global engineering firms who are 'Tier 1' aerospace suppliers. Industry watchers point to firms like Spirit Aerosystems or GKN. The Belfast plants don't just make parts for Bombardier, they also supply external customers such as Airbus. Bombardier Belfast director, Michael Ryan, previously said the Belfast factory would be capable of functioning as an outside supplier to Bombardier's business-jets division. Susan Fitzgerald, the regional co-ordinating officer with Unite trade union, said that the Bombardier workforce have been ""bracing for a shock announcement every morning"". ""The sale causes significant uncertainty for workers and members,"" she said. Stephen Kelly of Manufacturing NI warned that, between workers and Bombardier suppliers, the sale will have a direct impact on 12,000 jobs in the Northern Ireland economy. ""It's deeply worrying for the suppliers... and it is deeply worrying for the workers,"" said Mr Kelly. Bombardier, which is based in Montreal, has more than 68,000 employees in 28 countries. Last month, it slashed its full-year revenue forecast from $18bn (Â£13.7bn) to $17bn (Â£13bn) due to timing of aircraft deliveries, production challenges in its train-making division and unfavourable currency conversions. The rail unit is meant to generate $10bn (Â£7.6bn)  but Bombardier has cut its full-year revenue forecast for the division by almost 8% to $8.75bn (Â£6.7bn). Bombardier's president and chief executive Alain Bellemare said that the company expected to meet its aircraft delivery and financial performance targets for the year in its aerospace businesses.

"Pentagon officials commemorate Sexual Assault Awareness and Prevention Month in March 2015 The US military has reported a major spike in sexual assaults despite years of efforts to address the problem. Figures show 20,500 instances of unwanted sexual contact occurred in 2018, up from 14,900 in 2016 which is the last time a survey was conducted. Alcohol was involved in one third of cases, and female recruits ages 17 to 24 are at the highest risk of attack. On Thursday, Acting Defence Secretary Patrick Shanahan directed the military to ""criminalise"" sexual harassment. Sexual harassment can fall within other legal violations of military behaviour, but is not yet a ""stand-alone"" criminal offence. The directive from Mr Shanahan was among a series of other recommendations, released in a memo on Thursday. ""Sexual assault is illegal and immoral, is inconsistent with the military's mission and will not be tolerated,"" he wrote. In the US, sexual harassment is illegal, considered a form of sexual discrimination under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, which also covers discrimination based on race, skin colour, religion and national origin. The report released on Thursday surveyed the Army, Navy, Air Force and Marines, and estimated a total of 20,500 cases in 2018. The total figure is based reports of attacks as well as an extrapolation of survey data which wasgathered through a poll,externalof over 100,000 troops. Researchers say the survey has a 95% level of confidence. Incidents of unwanted sexual contact - which ranges from groping to rape - rose by around 38% between 2016 and 2018. Only one out of three cases were reported to authorities, the report found. In 2006, only one in 14 victims reported sexual assault crimes, the Pentagon said. In a statement issued on Thursday, the Marines acknowledged they had ""historically viewed an increase in reporting as an indicator Marines feel more empowered to report more confident in the care victims receive"". ""However, with the number of estimated assaults rising, especially among our young Marines, the Marine Corps must evolve its prevention methods and continue to foster a climate and culture of dignity, respect and trust,"" the statement said. In more than 85% of cases, victims knew their attacker. The majority of cases involved young women whose attacker was often a superior officer. The report should be ""a trip wire"", said Nate Galbreath, Deputy Director of the Department' of Defense's Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Office. ""This is what tells us that there's something going on that we need to hone in on,"" he told ABC News. ""We've got a higher prevalence for women 17 to 24. We're going to be focusing very, very tightly on that."" US senator: Air Force officer raped me US marines in nude photo sharing scandal Gruelling test for female US marines Congresswoman Jackie Speier, who chairs the House Armed Services Committee's personnel panel, told the USA Today newspaper that the military ""must accept that current programmes are simply not working"". ""Congress must lead the way in forcing the department to take more aggressive approaches to fighting this scourge,"" she said, calling for intervention from US lawmakers. On Thursday, Mr Shanahan revealed some of the recommendations made by the Sexual Assault Accountability and Investigation Task Force, which was created last month after the urging of Senator Martha McSally. This video can not be played Senator Martha McSally: ""I was ashamed and confused"" Senator McSally, who was the first female US fighter pilot to fly in combat, revealed in March that she had been raped by a superior officer while serving in the Air Force. In response to the report, Mr Shanahan directed the US Department of Defence ""criminalise"" sexual harassment ""to combat this scourge"". He detailed prevention, accountability and support efforts in order to ""eliminate"" sexual assault, including new methods of identifying repeat offenders. ""We must, and will, do better,"" he wrote in the memo. It is unclear if he would need congressional approval to make changes to the Uniform Code of Military Justice - the US military's legal code, to make the offence a ""stand-alone crime"". In his memo, Mr Shanahan also announced plans to train commanders in a new programme to uncover serial sex offenders. ""To put it bluntly, we are not performing to the standards and expectations we have for ourselves or for each other,"" Mr Shanahan said. ""This is unacceptable. We cannot shrink from facing the challenge head on."" In a series of tweets, Gen Robert B. Neller, the highest ranking officer in the US Marine Corps, joined in condemning the behaviour captured by the study. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

According to the report, compared with the Navy, Army, Air force and Coast guard, the Marines had the highest rates of sexual assault throughout the US Armed Forces - sitting at 11%. ""Marines know that sexual assault is a crime,"" Gen Neller wrote. ""We are better than this."" Democratic Senator and 2020 presidential contender Kirsten Gillibrand also responded on Twitter, calling on Congress to take action where the defence department has ""repeatedly failed"". Sen Gillibrand has been an outspoken advocate of victims of sexual assault and has pressed for legislation to make it easier to prosecute sexual violence in the military. In her tweets, she cited a 2013 statement from the chairmen of the Joint Chiefs of Staff - the highest US military post - that called sexual assault in the military a ""crisis"".

"This video can not be played Pacer Liz Ayres says slower runners were called ""fat"" and ""slow"" by contractors. One of the official pacers at the London Marathon has said she and fellow runners were treated ""horrifically"" during the race. Liz Ayres was asked to run the course in 7.5 hours to aid participants. She said runners were called ""fat"" and ""slow"" by contractors and volunteer marshals - and one woman received chemical burns from the clean-up operation that began around them. Marathon organisers said they were ""very sorry to hear"" of her experience. Like many other marathons, London asks volunteers to run at specific paces during the race as a timing aid for those participating. This was the first year the London Marathon had recruited people to run at paces slower than six hours. Ms Ayres said the clean-up operation had begun before all runners had passed Ms Ayres told theBBC's Victoria Derbyshire programmethat organisers had intended to make the run ""more inclusive"", with about 200 runners finishing the course at the same time or later than her. But, she said, despite running at the requested speed, the clean-up operation had begun around her and other runners and they had been ""told to hurry up"". She added that abuse had also been directed towards them by official marathon representatives, such as cleaning contractors and marshals. This included comments such as: ""If you weren't so fat, you could run,"" and: ""This is a race, not a walk."" Liz Ayres says some runners wanted ""to go home and quit"" Ms Ayres said she would ""rather the race was cancelled than people being spoken to like that"". ""I had runners that were crying - ones saying they were going to go home and quit,"" she said. Those affected had been running for charities. Some had been slower due to injuries, or not having been able to train due to family circumstances, Ms Ayres added. Ms Ayres said similar issues had also been reported by other pacers ahead of her. ""The 6.5-hour pacer said she experienced this, too,"" she said. ""If you look at the timings of people who finished, that means about 1,000 people were affected. ""That's almost one in every 40 runners."" Ms Ayres said runners on Tower Bridge had also had to ""dodge round sewage collection lorries"" and run through chemical spray used to clean the streets. One woman, Sarah Benjafield-Clarke, told the Victoria Derbyshire programme that her GP had confirmed that a blister she had developed from running during the race had developed into a chemical burn. Ms Ayres also said that as early as the three-mile mark, water stations had been packed away and she had called the London Marathon team only to be told she was lying and that the water stations were still open. Ms Ayres said water stations along the course had been packed away by the time she had reached them James Miller, 35, had been running for a dementia charity. He finished in just over eight hours and told the BBC it was ""really demotivating to see the course being dismantled around us"". ""The worst part was the clocks and timing mats being taking away, so when I passed the 30 and 35km points my time wasn't recorded and I wasn't able to keep track of the progress I was making towards the finish line. ""I even had to ask for directions at a couple of points as the route wasn't obvious. ""It was like you were forgotten about."" London Marathon event director Hugh Brasher said: ""We work hard to provide the best possible experience for every runner in the London Marathon and we were very sorry to hear about the experience of Elizabeth and a small number of other runners on Sunday. ""A senior member of our team called Elizabeth yesterday to find out more and we are now looking into this in detail as part of a full investigation. ""We'll be talking to the people involved to find out what happened and we'll also be contacting the runners who were in the group being paced by Elizabeth.""

"Adam Price said Wales ""doesn't matter one bit"" in Westminster's corridors of power European elections are a chance to draw a line under ""grief"" over the current ""lack of leadership in politics"", Plaid Cymru's leader has said. Launching the party's campaign, Adam Price urged anyone in Wales wanting another EU poll to back Plaid Cymru. He said the party was targeting Welsh Labour voters who felt let down on Brexit. Plaid was the only Welsh party ""with a chance of winning seats"" unequivocally  backing a further referendum, he said. Plaid says Wales should hold an independence referendum if Brexit occurs without a further EU referendum. Last Friday's announcementby Mr Price on an independence vote went further than hisparty conference speechin March. Farage launches Brexit Party campaign EU elections: Labour calls for Brexit poll List of candidates for Wales At the Plaid Cymru campaign launch for the European election in Cardiff on Thursday, Mr Price said thousand of Labour supporters across Wales were living in a ""state of permanent despair"". European elections, on 23 May, offered a chance to draw a line ""under your grief"" over the ""lack of leadership in politics in general at the moment"", he said. ""These elections are a bridge across which thousands of people can venture to make the change that Wales needs,"" he said. ""If we want a European future for Wales we have to vote for Plaid Cymru - the only party that unequivocally in that future."" A vote for Plaid Cymru was ""our chance"" to ""make Wales matter in Europe and the world"" he said. ""We know that Wales matters. Wales matters to millions of our people, in their daily lives. But in the corridors of power in Westminster it doesn't matter one bit. ""This election is not just about putting Wales - our lives, our problems and our dreams - at the heart of Europe, but bringing in Wales from the margins, out from the cold."" Lead Plaid candidate Jill Evans said Wales needs a voice in Europe ""more than ever"" Plaid has previously said that a cross-party deal between anti-Brexit parties ""could have been an opportunity to offer the voters the clearest possible choice at the ballot box"" andblamed the Greensin Wales for the two parties failing to work together in the European election. The Green Party has saidno approach,externalhad been made to it by other parties. In the last European Parliament election in 2014, the four Welsh seats were split between Plaid, Labour, UKIP and the Conservatives. Mr Price said: ""We are the only party in Wales with a chance of winning seats in the European Parliament that is unequivocally supporting a People's Vote. ""For that reason we are appealing for support across the parties. We are saying to progressive people across the political spectrum - join us. ""Our appeal is especially to [Welsh] Labour supporters who, for years, have been in a state of permanent disappointment with the leadership of their party."" Plaid Cymru's lead candidate, Jill Evans, first elected an MEP in 1999, said she was ""proud and thankful"" to be standing for a fifth time. ""Because now, more than ever, Wales needs a voice in Europe and because there is so much potential to build a better future for our nation in Europe."" ""We are the only realistic choice for voters who are looking for a different and a constructive way forward,"" she added. There are eight parties fighting for four Welsh seats in the planned European elections on 23 May.

""I had runners that were crying - ones saying they were going to go home and quit,"" she said. Those affected had been running for charities. Some had been slower due to injuries, or not having been able to train due to family circumstances, Ms Ayres added. Ms Ayres said similar issues had also been reported by other pacers ahead of her. ""The 6.5-hour pacer said she experienced this, too,"" she said. ""If you look at the timings of people who finished, that means about 1,000 people were affected. ""That's almost one in every 40 runners."" Ms Ayres said runners on Tower Bridge had also had to ""dodge round sewage collection lorries"" and run through chemical spray used to clean the streets. One woman, Sarah Benjafield-Clarke, told the Victoria Derbyshire programme that her GP had confirmed that a blister she had developed from running during the race had developed into a chemical burn. Ms Ayres also said that as early as the three-mile mark, water stations had been packed away and she had called the London Marathon team only to be told she was lying and that the water stations were still open. Ms Ayres said water stations along the course had been packed away by the time she had reached them James Miller, 35, had been running for a dementia charity. He finished in just over eight hours and told the BBC it was ""really demotivating to see the course being dismantled around us"". ""The worst part was the clocks and timing mats being taking away, so when I passed the 30 and 35km points my time wasn't recorded and I wasn't able to keep track of the progress I was making towards the finish line. ""I even had to ask for directions at a couple of points as the route wasn't obvious. ""It was like you were forgotten about."" London Marathon event director Hugh Brasher said: ""We work hard to provide the best possible experience for every runner in the London Marathon and we were very sorry to hear about the experience of Elizabeth and a small number of other runners on Sunday. ""A senior member of our team called Elizabeth yesterday to find out more and we are now looking into this in detail as part of a full investigation. ""We'll be talking to the people involved to find out what happened and we'll also be contacting the runners who were in the group being paced by Elizabeth.""

"This video can not be played Bombardier to sell NI operations The aerospace firm, Bombardier, is putting its Northern Ireland operation up for sale as part of a reorganisation of the business. The Canadian aircraft manufacturer employs about 3,600 people across several locations in Northern Ireland. The company said it would be working closely with employees and unions, through any future transition period. Unions said it caused ""uncertainty"" for workers at Northern Ireland's biggest manufacturing employer. How important is Bombardier to NI? 'Bombshell' as Bombardier cuts 490 NI jobs Unions consult over Bombardier action It is selling off its aerospace operations in Belfast, Newtownabbey, Newtownards and Dunmurry. The company's Moroccan operation is also being sold off. In a statement, Bombardier said it was consolidating all aerospace assets into a ""single, streamlined and fully integrated business"". ""As a result, Bombardier will pursue the divestiture of its Belfast and Morocco aerostructures businesses."",external The statement added: ""Our sites in Belfast and Morocco have seen a significant increase in work from other global customers in recent years. This video can not be played The history of Bombardier in Northern Ireland ""We are recognised as a global leader in aerostructures, with unique end-to-end capabilities - through design and development, testing and manufacture, to after-market support."" It said Bombardier was committed to finding the right buyer. It added: ""We understand that this announcement may cause concern among our employees, but we will be working closely with them and our unions as matters progress, and through any future transition period to a new owner. ""There are no new workforce announcements as a result of this decision."" Last November, Bombardier said it was to cut a further 490 jobs from its Northern Ireland operations. Business Secretary Greg Clark spoke to representatives of the company before the announcement was made. ""The Belfast plant is one of our most important aerospace facilities in the country and a vital asset in the UK's leading aerospace sector,"" he said in a statement. ""The government will work with potential buyers to take this successful and ambitious business forward."" Speaking on BBC News NI's Talkback programme, Gavin Robinson, MP for East Belfast, said that, in recent years, Bombardier workers have not been able to ""get a break"". He said that ""government has a role to ensure that all avenues are explored"" in relation to the sale. Analysis: John Campbell, BBC News NI economics and business editor It is not yet clear who could buy the Belfast operation but it may be attractive to global engineering firms who are 'Tier 1' aerospace suppliers. Industry watchers point to firms like Spirit Aerosystems or GKN. The Belfast plants don't just make parts for Bombardier, they also supply external customers such as Airbus. Bombardier Belfast director, Michael Ryan, previously said the Belfast factory would be capable of functioning as an outside supplier to Bombardier's business-jets division. Susan Fitzgerald, the regional co-ordinating officer with Unite trade union, said that the Bombardier workforce have been ""bracing for a shock announcement every morning"". ""The sale causes significant uncertainty for workers and members,"" she said. Stephen Kelly of Manufacturing NI warned that, between workers and Bombardier suppliers, the sale will have a direct impact on 12,000 jobs in the Northern Ireland economy. ""It's deeply worrying for the suppliers... and it is deeply worrying for the workers,"" said Mr Kelly. Bombardier, which is based in Montreal, has more than 68,000 employees in 28 countries. Last month, it slashed its full-year revenue forecast from $18bn (Â£13.7bn) to $17bn (Â£13bn) due to timing of aircraft deliveries, production challenges in its train-making division and unfavourable currency conversions. The rail unit is meant to generate $10bn (Â£7.6bn)  but Bombardier has cut its full-year revenue forecast for the division by almost 8% to $8.75bn (Â£6.7bn). Bombardier's president and chief executive Alain Bellemare said that the company expected to meet its aircraft delivery and financial performance targets for the year in its aerospace businesses.

"Ella Kissi-Debrah lived 25m from the South Circular Road in south London A fresh inquest will be held into the death of a nine-year-old girl whose fatal asthma attack may have been linked to air pollution near her home. Ella Kissi-Debrah, who lived near the South Circular Road in Lewisham, south east London, died in 2013 after having seizures for three years. The High Court granted a new inquest after Ella's mother said more evidence had come to light. Rosamund Kissi-Debrah said she was ""delighted"" by the ruling. In a statement, she said she was looking forward to ""finally getting the truth"". ""The past six years of not knowing why my beautiful, bright and bubbly daughter died has been difficult for me and my family, but I hope the new inquest will answer whether air pollution took her away from us,"" she said. ""If it is proved that pollution killed Ella then the government will be forced to sit up and take notice that this hidden but deadly killer is cutting short our children's lives."" Ella had 27 visits to hospital for her asthma attacks Ella was first taken to hospital in 2010 after a coughing fit and subsequently admitted to hospital 27 times. Tracking the toxic air that's killing millions Air pollution: what are the effects on humans? Dad's mission to cut toxic air at school An inquest in 2014, which focused on Ella's medical care, concluded her death was caused by acute respiratory failure and severe asthma. But a 2018 report said it was likely unlawful levels of pollution, which were detected at a monitoring station one mile from Ella's home, contributed to her fatal asthma attack. Rosamund Kissi-Debrah says air pollution is cutting children's lives short Ruling with two other judges that the 2014 conclusions should be quashed, Judge Mark Lucraft QC said: ""In our judgment, the discovery of new evidence makes it necessary in the interests of justice that a fresh inquest be held."" This video can not be played How bad is air pollution? He said Ella's family's lawyers had argued the new evidence demonstrated there was an ""arguable failure"" by the state to comply with its duties under the European Convention on Human Rights, which protects the right to life.

"This video can not be played The king is seen pouring sacred water on the head of Queen Suthida The king of Thailand has married the deputy head of his personal security detail, and given her the title of queen, a royal statement has said. The surprise announcement about his long-time consort comes before his elaborate coronation ceremonies begin on Saturday. King Maha Vajiralongkorn, 66, became the constitutional monarch after the death of his much-loved father in 2016. He has been married and divorced three times before and has seven children. A royal statement said,external: King Vajiralongkorn ""has decided to promote General Suthida Vajiralongkorn Na Ayudhya, his royal consort, to become Queen Suthida and she will hold royal title and status as part of the royal family"".

"This video can not be played Tear gas and water cannon hit Venezuela protesters on Wednesday A woman was shot dead and dozens injured in the Venezuelan capital Caracas on Wednesday, in clashes between opposition supporters and pro-government forces. The military fired tear gas and water cannon amid rival demonstrations. Opposition leader Juan GuaidÃ³ called for those responsible for the death of a 27-year-old woman to be found. He also urged public employees to go on strike on Thursday, to try to force President NicolÃ¡s Maduro to stand down. In January, Mr GuaidÃ³ declared himself Venezuela's interim leader, and he has been recognised by more than 50 countries including the US, UK and most Latin America nations. As the head of the opposition-controlled National Assembly, he invoked the constitution to assume an interim presidency, arguing that Mr Maduro's re-election last year was illegitimate. But Mr Maduro - who is backed by Russia, China and the leaders of Venezuela's military - has refused to cede power. Venezuela crisis in 300 words Who is Juan GuaidÃ³? Profile: NicolÃ¡s Maduro The president dismissed suggestions he had been ready to flee the country and accused the US of directing an attempted coup. Those involved would be punished, he said. On Wednesday, both pro- and anti-government supporters held demonstrations in Caracas that were initially peaceful. There were reports of gunfire in the city, and a local NGO, the Venezuelan Observatory of Social Conflict, said Jurubith Rausseo, 27, had been shot dead during a rally in the opposition stronghold of Altamira. At least 46 people were injured in clashes between opposition supporters and the security forces. This video can not be played Military vehicles were filmed driving into demonstrators on Tuesday On Tuesday,Mr GuaidÃ³ posted a video showing him with a number of men in military uniform. He said he had the support of ""brave soldiers"" in Caracas. Is there a new cult of personality in Venezuela? How much aid is getting into Venezuela? Who is buying Venezuela's oil? He urged Venezuelans to join them in the streets, and appeared alongside another opposition leader, Leopoldo LÃ³pez, who had been under house arrest after being found guilty of inciting violence during protests in 2014. Spain's government later said that Mr LÃ³pez and his family had sought safety in their embassy, but said the opposition figure has not claimed political asylum. Supporters on both sides gathered around the city throughout Tuesday, and there were clashes between Mr GuaidÃ³'s supporters and armed military vehicles. In a series of tweets (in Spanish), Mr GuaidÃ³ said the final phase of ""Operation Liberty"" had begun and it was the turn of public workers to join in. He urged protesters to stay on the streets until Mr Maduro's government would be finally forced to resign. Mr GuaidÃ³ has been courting the public sector for weeks - but winning their support will be difficult, the BBC's Americas editor Candace Piette says. For years, state employees have been told that if they did not turn up at government rallies, they would lose their jobs. So if the opposition leader does win them over, it will be a huge victory against President Maduro, our editor says. Mr Maduro also addressed his supporters in the capital Tensions are rising between the US and Russia over the crisis. US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the US may take military action to resolve the crisis, and accused Russia and Cuba of destabilising the country through their support for Mr Maduro. The US also reiterated its support for Mr GuaidÃ³. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov told Mr Pompeo that America's influence over Venezuela was destructive and a violation of international law. UN Secretary General AntÃ³nio Guterres has appealed for both sides in Venezuela to avoid violence, whilethe EU has called for ""utmost restraint to avoid the loss of lives and an escalation in tensions"",external. This video can not be played Why Venezuela matters to the US... and vice versa Governments who still back Mr Maduro - including Bolivia and Cuba - condemned Mr GuaidÃ³'s efforts as an attempted coup. The Mexican government expressed ""concern about a possible increase in violence"" while Colombian President Ivan Duque urged the Venezuelan military to stand ""on the right side of history"" against Mr Maduro.

The County Antrim pair, who still live independently at their Randalstown bungalow, are thought to be Northern Ireland's oldest married couple. Married on 23 September 1942 in the middle of World War Two, this year marks their 77th wedding anniversary.

A keen baker, Mrs Graham still does all the cooking and cleaning for the couple, but takes a break every Friday to get her hair done. Mrs Graham says she and her husband always make up after a row She has spent just one night in hospital for a minor ailment in her 10 decades.

"Henry Vincent and another man broke into Richard Osborn-Brooks's home in Hither Green A 79-year-old man who killed an armed burglar with a kitchen knife acted lawfully, an inquest has decided. Richard Osborn-Brooks stabbed Henry Vincent with a knife in Hither Green, south-east London, in April last year. Mr Osborn-Brooks told Southwark Coroner's Court the 37-year-old had threatened him with a screwdriver, then ""rushed forward"" and ""ran into the knife I was holding"". Coroner Andrew Harris recorded a verdict of lawfully killing. Speaking by videolink, Mr Osborn-Brooks told the inquest he still believed the intruder was ""intending to do me harm"" during the break-in on 4 April 2018. He said two men had knocked on his door, grabbed him and pushed him inside. Both then demanded money as one then shoved him toward the kitchen and the other ran upstairs. He told the hearing that when he grabbed the knife, Mr Vincent's accomplice fled out of the front door but the intruder came down the stairs holding the screwdriver and saying ""get out of my way or I'll stick you with this"". Mr Osborn-Brooks said he had then warned Mr Vincent that his weapon was ""bigger than yours"". ""I thought he would look at my knife... and he would take the opportunity to run out the front door which was open. ""He definitely didn't try to get out of the front door, he came towards me,"" Mr Osborn-Brooks said. Mr Osborn-Brooks said Mr Vincent threatened him with a screwdriver during the raid Mr Vincent's cause of death was given as an incised wound to the chest. His sister had told the hearing her brother was ""not a violent person"". ""He was a father, he was a son, he was a brother. No one deserves to die,"" Rosie Vincent said. In a statement, the pathologist who carried out the post-mortem examination said a toxicology report indicated ""a recent use of both cocaine and heroin"". He said Mr Vincent ""may have been experiencing the effects"" at the time of the raid. Senior coroner Andrew Harris said: ""The interaction that led to the stabbing was the simultaneous approach of the deceased with a small screwdriver and the forward movement of the householder with a kitchen knife, leading to moderate force being applied by the knife to Mr Vincent's chest, and its penetration. ""The householder was terrified and asserted he acted in self-defence after an assault by the other intruder. He was close to, but not obstructing, the exit by the intruder.""

Rosamund Kissi-Debrah says air pollution is cutting children's lives short Ruling with two other judges that the 2014 conclusions should be quashed, Judge Mark Lucraft QC said: ""In our judgment, the discovery of new evidence makes it necessary in the interests of justice that a fresh inquest be held."" This video can not be played How bad is air pollution? He said Ella's family's lawyers had argued the new evidence demonstrated there was an ""arguable failure"" by the state to comply with its duties under the European Convention on Human Rights, which protects the right to life. Ella may become the first person in the UK for whom air pollution is listed as the cause of death.

"This video can not be played Bombardier to sell NI operations The aerospace firm, Bombardier, is putting its Northern Ireland operation up for sale as part of a reorganisation of the business. The Canadian aircraft manufacturer employs about 3,600 people across several locations in Northern Ireland. The company said it would be working closely with employees and unions, through any future transition period. Unions said it caused ""uncertainty"" for workers at Northern Ireland's biggest manufacturing employer. How important is Bombardier to NI? 'Bombshell' as Bombardier cuts 490 NI jobs Unions consult over Bombardier action It is selling off its aerospace operations in Belfast, Newtownabbey, Newtownards and Dunmurry. The company's Moroccan operation is also being sold off. In a statement, Bombardier said it was consolidating all aerospace assets into a ""single, streamlined and fully integrated business"". ""As a result, Bombardier will pursue the divestiture of its Belfast and Morocco aerostructures businesses."",external The statement added: ""Our sites in Belfast and Morocco have seen a significant increase in work from other global customers in recent years. This video can not be played The history of Bombardier in Northern Ireland ""We are recognised as a global leader in aerostructures, with unique end-to-end capabilities - through design and development, testing and manufacture, to after-market support."" It said Bombardier was committed to finding the right buyer. It added: ""We understand that this announcement may cause concern among our employees, but we will be working closely with them and our unions as matters progress, and through any future transition period to a new owner. ""There are no new workforce announcements as a result of this decision."" Last November, Bombardier said it was to cut a further 490 jobs from its Northern Ireland operations. Business Secretary Greg Clark spoke to representatives of the company before the announcement was made. ""The Belfast plant is one of our most important aerospace facilities in the country and a vital asset in the UK's leading aerospace sector,"" he said in a statement. ""The government will work with potential buyers to take this successful and ambitious business forward."" Speaking on BBC News NI's Talkback programme, Gavin Robinson, MP for East Belfast, said that, in recent years, Bombardier workers have not been able to ""get a break"". He said that ""government has a role to ensure that all avenues are explored"" in relation to the sale. Analysis: John Campbell, BBC News NI economics and business editor It is not yet clear who could buy the Belfast operation but it may be attractive to global engineering firms who are 'Tier 1' aerospace suppliers. Industry watchers point to firms like Spirit Aerosystems or GKN. The Belfast plants don't just make parts for Bombardier, they also supply external customers such as Airbus. Bombardier Belfast director, Michael Ryan, previously said the Belfast factory would be capable of functioning as an outside supplier to Bombardier's business-jets division. Susan Fitzgerald, the regional co-ordinating officer with Unite trade union, said that the Bombardier workforce have been ""bracing for a shock announcement every morning"". ""The sale causes significant uncertainty for workers and members,"" she said. Stephen Kelly of Manufacturing NI warned that, between workers and Bombardier suppliers, the sale will have a direct impact on 12,000 jobs in the Northern Ireland economy. ""It's deeply worrying for the suppliers... and it is deeply worrying for the workers,"" said Mr Kelly. Bombardier, which is based in Montreal, has more than 68,000 employees in 28 countries. Last month, it slashed its full-year revenue forecast from $18bn (Â£13.7bn) to $17bn (Â£13bn) due to timing of aircraft deliveries, production challenges in its train-making division and unfavourable currency conversions. The rail unit is meant to generate $10bn (Â£7.6bn)  but Bombardier has cut its full-year revenue forecast for the division by almost 8% to $8.75bn (Â£6.7bn). Bombardier's president and chief executive Alain Bellemare said that the company expected to meet its aircraft delivery and financial performance targets for the year in its aerospace businesses.

"The ship is reportedly the Freewinds, shown here docked in Aruba in 2014 A US cruise ship has been placed in quarantine by the Caribbean island of St Lucia after a case of measles was reported on board, the island's chief medical officer said. Dr Merlene Fredericks James said there was a confirmed case of measles on board and ""thought it prudent that we quarantine the ship"". No-one aboard was allowed to leave. The ship is reportedly the Freewinds, which is said to be owned and operated by the Church of Scientology. Dr Fredericks James said in a video statement posted on YouTube on Tuesday that the ministry learned of the confirmed measles case from ""two reputable sources"". Allow YouTube content?

She cited the fact that measles was a highly infectious disease as a factor in the decision. ""One infected person can easily infect others through coughing, sneezing, droplets being on various surfaces, etc. So because of the risk of potential infection - not just from the confirmed measles case, but from other persons who may be on the boat at the time - we thought it prudent to make a decision not to allow anyone to disembark."" She also citedthe current situation in the US, where cases of the disease are at a 25-year high, as another factor. St Lucia country profile NBC News, citing a St Lucia Coast Guard, reported that the boat is the Freewinds, a 440ft (134m) vessel owned and operated by the Church of Scientology, thought to have some 300 passengers on board. ""The ship's doctor has the confirmed case in isolation on the ship,"" Dr Fredericks James was quoted as saying by NBC. ""The individual is in stable condition."" The St Lucian authorities do not have the authority to keep the ship from leaving, and it is currently due to leave the island at 23:59 (03:59 GMT) on Thursday, NBC reports officials as saying. The ship-tracking website MarineTraffic.com shows a ship called SMV Freewinds docked in Castries,external, the country's capital. The Church of Scientology has so far not publicly commented on the case. Earlier this week, US health officials reported that more than 700 people had been infected by measles this year, marking a 25-year high for cases of the infectious disease in the country. This video can not be played BBC health correspondent Smitha Mundasad explains the US measles outbreak Cases had been recorded in 22 states and were mostly affecting unvaccinated children, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said on Monday. Officials said the increase in cases is the largest since 1994, including 78 reported in the past week. Some parents are said to have chosen to leave their children unvaccinated due to the unscientific claim that vaccines cause illnesses such as autism, or on religious grounds. Most cases occurred in 13 outbreak zones, including in New York City's orthodox Jewish communities.

"This video can not be played Tear gas and water cannon hit Venezuela protesters on Wednesday A woman was shot dead and dozens injured in the Venezuelan capital Caracas on Wednesday, in clashes between opposition supporters and pro-government forces. The military fired tear gas and water cannon amid rival demonstrations. Opposition leader Juan GuaidÃ³ called for those responsible for the death of a 27-year-old woman to be found. He also urged public employees to go on strike on Thursday, to try to force President NicolÃ¡s Maduro to stand down. In January, Mr GuaidÃ³ declared himself Venezuela's interim leader, and he has been recognised by more than 50 countries including the US, UK and most Latin America nations. As the head of the opposition-controlled National Assembly, he invoked the constitution to assume an interim presidency, arguing that Mr Maduro's re-election last year was illegitimate. But Mr Maduro - who is backed by Russia, China and the leaders of Venezuela's military - has refused to cede power. Venezuela crisis in 300 words Who is Juan GuaidÃ³? Profile: NicolÃ¡s Maduro The president dismissed suggestions he had been ready to flee the country and accused the US of directing an attempted coup. Those involved would be punished, he said. On Wednesday, both pro- and anti-government supporters held demonstrations in Caracas that were initially peaceful. There were reports of gunfire in the city, and a local NGO, the Venezuelan Observatory of Social Conflict, said Jurubith Rausseo, 27, had been shot dead during a rally in the opposition stronghold of Altamira. At least 46 people were injured in clashes between opposition supporters and the security forces. This video can not be played Military vehicles were filmed driving into demonstrators on Tuesday On Tuesday,Mr GuaidÃ³ posted a video showing him with a number of men in military uniform. He said he had the support of ""brave soldiers"" in Caracas. Is there a new cult of personality in Venezuela? How much aid is getting into Venezuela? Who is buying Venezuela's oil? He urged Venezuelans to join them in the streets, and appeared alongside another opposition leader, Leopoldo LÃ³pez, who had been under house arrest after being found guilty of inciting violence during protests in 2014. Spain's government later said that Mr LÃ³pez and his family had sought safety in their embassy, but said the opposition figure has not claimed political asylum. Supporters on both sides gathered around the city throughout Tuesday, and there were clashes between Mr GuaidÃ³'s supporters and armed military vehicles. In a series of tweets (in Spanish), Mr GuaidÃ³ said the final phase of ""Operation Liberty"" had begun and it was the turn of public workers to join in. He urged protesters to stay on the streets until Mr Maduro's government would be finally forced to resign. Mr GuaidÃ³ has been courting the public sector for weeks - but winning their support will be difficult, the BBC's Americas editor Candace Piette says. For years, state employees have been told that if they did not turn up at government rallies, they would lose their jobs. So if the opposition leader does win them over, it will be a huge victory against President Maduro, our editor says. Mr Maduro also addressed his supporters in the capital Tensions are rising between the US and Russia over the crisis. US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the US may take military action to resolve the crisis, and accused Russia and Cuba of destabilising the country through their support for Mr Maduro. The US also reiterated its support for Mr GuaidÃ³. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov told Mr Pompeo that America's influence over Venezuela was destructive and a violation of international law. UN Secretary General AntÃ³nio Guterres has appealed for both sides in Venezuela to avoid violence, whilethe EU has called for ""utmost restraint to avoid the loss of lives and an escalation in tensions"",external. This video can not be played Why Venezuela matters to the US... and vice versa Governments who still back Mr Maduro - including Bolivia and Cuba - condemned Mr GuaidÃ³'s efforts as an attempted coup. The Mexican government expressed ""concern about a possible increase in violence"" while Colombian President Ivan Duque urged the Venezuelan military to stand ""on the right side of history"" against Mr Maduro.

"This video can not be played The pair of 100-year-olds are still in love after 76 years Nellie Graham is celebrating her 100th birthday and she is in good company. Her husband, Joe, marked the same milestone last August. The County Antrim pair, who still live independently at their Randalstown bungalow, are thought to be Northern Ireland's oldest married couple. Married on 23 September 1942 in the middle of World War Two, this year marks their 77th wedding anniversary.

A keen baker, Mrs Graham still does all the cooking and cleaning for the couple, but takes a break every Friday to get her hair done. Mrs Graham says she and her husband always make up after a row She has spent just one night in hospital for a minor ailment in her 10 decades. Mr Graham is in poorer health, so his wife cares for him every day, and gets up at 07:00 every day to make him porridge for breakfast. Does she have any tips for a long and happy marriage?

On how she feels to be one of very few married couples to have reached 100, Mrs Graham says: ""Well anyone we would talk to have never known a couple, they've known one, but not a couple, so this will go down in the records.

India's National Disaster Management Authority has warned people along the east coast, especially fishermen, not to go out to sea becausethe conditions are ""phenomenal"",external. The agency said the ""total destruction of thatched houses"" was possible, as well as ""extensive damage"" to other structures. Cyclone Fani made landfall in Puri district and will continue moving to West Bengal and Tamilnadu ""I can confirm two deaths for now,"" Orissa special relief commissioner Bishnupada Sethi told AFP news agency. ""[A] man in one of the shelters died because of a heart attack. Another person went out in the storm despite our warnings and died because a tree fell on him,"" he said. The cyclone is expected to move towards Chittagong in Bangladesh in a weaker form on Saturday. It coincides with high tides in the country, which may exacerbate potential flooding issues there. The port city of Cox's Bazar, where hundreds of thousands of Rohingya refugees live in camps with minimal shelter, is also on alert. But the cyclone is currently not expected to hit the camps unless it changes path, which is not thought likely. In Februarythe International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) began distributing tarpaulins,externalahead of the region's ""cyclone season"" - but warned that if a deadly storm rolls in, shelters made of battered bamboo and shredded plastic would offer little protection. The navy, the coast guard and the National Disaster Response Force have all been prepared for deployment. Two ships with divers and doctors have been stationed at the southern port cities of Vishakapatnam and Chennai (formerly Madras), an official told local media. Train services have been cancelled In 2017, Cyclone Ockhi killed more than 200 people and displaced hundreds. In October last year, officials in Orissa evacuated hundreds of thousands of people when another cyclone struck. But India has improved its protections and responses to these disasters in recent years. The state's most deadly cyclone on record took place in 1999, killing almost 10,000 people. India's electoral commission has relaxed its rules about what the government can do during election periods so that the authorities can carry out relief work. The country is in the middle of a multi-phased election which started last month. Under normal circumstances the incumbent government has certain powers suspended, so that it can't announce new schemes or take new decisions during the voting period. Although the election will continue until the end of May, Orissa has already voted. Cyclone Fani lashes India's eastern coast.

"Gavin Williamson has strenuously denied he leaked information from the National Security Council as calls are being made for a police inquiry. He was sacked as defence secretary for allegedly disclosing plans to allow Chinese telecoms giant Huawei to help build the UK's 5G network. Opposition MPs said there should be an investigation into whether the Official Secrets Act had been breached. David Lidington, the PM's de facto deputy, said the matter was closed. Responding to questions from MPs in the Commons, he said it was not considered necessary to refer it to the police, but ministers would ""co-operate fully should the police themselves consider an investigation necessary"". Mr Lidington told MPs that Mr Williamson had not been accused of any criminal offence, but had lost the confidence of the prime minister. Mr Williamson isquoted in several of Thursday's newspapersas saying he was the victim of a ""vendetta"" and a ""kangaroo court"". He told Sky News thathe ""swore on his children's lives"",externalthat he was not responsible for the leak. Reaction to Williamson's sacking Exchange of letters between May and Williamson Profile: Gavin Williamson Kuenssberg: Now Williamson told to 'go away and shut up' He also cited poor relations with Sir Mark Sedwill, the Cabinet Secretary and National Security Adviser, who carried out the leak investigation,telling the Times,externalhe would have had been ""absolutely exonerated"" had police probed what went on after the NSC meeting. The inquiry into the leak began after the Daily Telegraph reported on the council's confidential discussions - including warnings from several cabinet members about possible risks to national security over a deal with Huawei. At a meeting with Mr Williamson on Wednesday evening, Theresa May told him she had information that suggested that he was responsible for the unauthorised disclosure. In aletter confirming his dismissal,she said: ""No other credible version of events to explain this leak has been identified."" In response, Mr Williamson - defence secretary since 2017 - wrote he was ""confident"" that a ""thorough and formal inquiry"" would have ""vindicated"" his position. ""I appreciate you offering me the option to resign, but to resign would have been to accept that I, my civil servants, my military advisers or my staff were responsible: this was not the case,"" he said. BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg said sources close to the former defence secretary had told her Mr Williamson did talk to the Daily Telegraph's deputy political editor, Steven Swinford, but ""that absolutely does not prove"" he leaked the story to him. Brexitcast becomes leakcast: My way or the Huawei Penny Mordaunt: UK's first female defence secretary Huawei: The story of a controversial company Labour deputy leader Tom Watson told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that Mr Williamson has ""a right to clear his name"" and the best way to do that is through a criminal inquiry. He said: ""This is about the law applying equally to everyone. We have had very high profile civil servants going to jail for breaching the Official Secrets Act."" Disclosure of official information relating to security and intelligence by a ""Crown servant"" - including government ministers - can be illegal. For it to be an offence the disclosure has to be damaging and done without lawful authority (ie not as part of the person's official duties). Being found guilty of this carries a sentence ranging from a fine to two years in prison. If the police were to launch an investigation, the Attorney General Geoffrey Cox would decide whether there was to be a prosecution. Former national security adviser Lord Ricketts, a crossbench peer, told the BBC's Newsnight programme that on the face of it, the leak was a breach of the act and police ought to be considering an inquiry. The Liberal Democrats said its deputy leader Jo Swinson has written to the Metropolitan Police Commissioner calling for a criminal investigation ""to ascertain whether the actions of Mr Williamson constitute a breach"". Scotland Yard said in a statement that it was a matter for the National Security Council and the Cabinet Office, and it was not carrying out an investigation. ""Clearly, if at any stage we receive any information that would suggest criminal offences have been committed, then we will look into that,"" it added. Downing Street has made a very serious accusation and is sure enough to carry out this sacking. For the prime minister's allies, it will show that she is, despite the political turmoil, still strong enough to move some of her ministers around - to hire and fire. Mr Williamson is strenuously still denying that the leak was anything to do with him at all. There is nothing fond, or anything conciliatory, in either the letter from the prime minister to him, or his reply back to her. Read more from Laura But former head of the civil service Gus O'Donnell told Today that the cabinet secretary had advised the prime minister that the leak was a breach of the ministerial code and not a breach of the Official Secrets Act, saying: ""That is why it is a matter for the prime minister."" Former Army chief Lord Dannatt told Today that the sacking was a ""personal tragedy"" for Mr Williamson, but also ""very upsetting"" for defence. He said Mr Williamson had worked ""very hard"" for defence in trying to get more resources. This video can not be played On Tuesday, before he was sacked by Theresa May, Gavin Williamson said in a BBC interview that he had never leaked anything from the NSC The National Security Council is made up of senior cabinet ministers and its weekly meetings are chaired by the prime minister, with other ministers, officials and senior figures from the armed forces and intelligence agencies invited when needed. It is a forum where secret intelligence can be shared by GCHQ, MI6 and MI5 with ministers, all of whom have signed the Official Secrets Act. There has been no formal confirmation of Huawei's role in the 5G network and No 10 said a final decision would be made at the end of spring. The US has been campaigning hard among allies to exclude the Chinese telecoms giant Huawei from delivering 5G, because of its security concerns. Huawei has denied there is any risk of spying or sabotage, or that it is controlled by the Chinese government. Penny Mordaunt is taking over as defence secretary Penny Mordaunt has taken over as defence secretary - the first woman in the role - and prisons minister Rory Stewart is replacing her as international development secretary. By BBC security correspondent Gordon Corera Sources maintain damage has been done by the leak. It was not of the most sensitive possible information. That would be details of intelligence sources and methods. A leak in Washington a few years ago pointed to the fact that there was an agent inside a group planning attacks on the West from Yemen. That put the agent's life at risk and compromised a valuable stream of intelligence. The Huawei leak related to a policy decision. But the damage lies in relations with allies. The US has been campaigning hard for Huawei to be excluded from new 5G networks. The leak may not have fully captured the restrictions to be placed on the company even though its role was approved. And because the decision was leaked within hours of the meeting ending, there was no chance to explain the decision to Washington. The day the leak appeared, a senior official from America's National Security Agency spy agency spoke to me to reiterate Washington's concerns and days later a State Department official told me that the US would have to re-evaluate information sharing with allies that used Huawei. That official also came to London to continue the push. And so the frustration from UK officials is that their ability to explain the policy to the public and to allies was compromised by the speed and substance of what was revealed.

"This video can not be played Bank of England governor, Mark Carney Interest rate increases could be ""more frequent"" than expected if the economy performs as the Bank of England is expecting, governor Mark Carney says. The markets are forecasting just one interest rate increase by 2021. But if there is a resolution to the Brexit impasse, and inflation and growth continue to pick-up, then more increases are likely, Mr Carney said. As expected, the Bank kept interest rates on hold at 0.75% at its latest policy meeting. Interest rates have been at that level since last August, when the Bank raised them by a quarter of a percentage point. The Bank is expecting growth and inflation to pick up over the next two years. Slight fall in UK unemployment Wanted: New Bank of England boss In a news conference, Mr Carney said: ""If something broadly like this forecast comes to pass... it will require interest rate increases over that period and it will require more, and more frequent interest rate increases, than the market currently expects."" The Bank's forecasts are based on a ""smooth adjustment"" to any new trading relationship with the European Union. In its Quarterly Inflation Report,,externalthe Bank of England raised its UK growth forecast for this year, in part because the outlook for the global economy is a bit brighter. The Bank now sees growth of 1.5% this year, up from February's forecast of 1.2%. Economic growth has been subdued since the UK voted in June 2016 to leave the EU. In particular, business investment has been falling. The Bank says stockpiling has been giving the economy a short-term boost, but for this year, the strengthening of the global economy will have a more important effect. In the minutes from its latest policy meeting,external, the Bank said ""global growth had shown signs of stabilisation, and had been a little better than expected"". It also forecasts the unemployment rate will continue falling in the coming years to 3.5% by 2022, which would be the lowest rate since 1973. The Bank is reluctant to move interest rates until there is further clarity, not least about the path of Brexit. For as it highlights (again), the movement in rates then could be ""in either direction"", depending on the outcome, the impact on the economy and whether it decides to support growth or inflation. If all goes smoothly, then the Bank is likely to turn its firepower on inflation and proceed with raising rates ""at a gradual pace and to a limited extent"" - especially if there's a bounce in investment and hiring. At the moment, the MPC reckons ""the cost of waiting for further information is relatively low"". But that, given the degree of inflationary pressure it's forecasting, is quite a gamble. If the Bank has missed the boat, then rates might have to ultimately rise faster and by more than originally envisaged to curb inflation. That would be an unenviable parting gift from Mr Carney to his successor. Read Dharshini's analysis in full. Moves in interest rates are important to the 3.5 million people with variable or tracker mortgages. Even a small quarter-point rise can add hundreds of pounds to their annual mortgage costs. Mortgage market experts say that for those who can afford to buy a home, now is a good time to borrow. ""Right now, you've got lenders that want your business and rates are exceptionally low,"" said David Hollingworth, from L&C Mortgages. Some lenders are offering five-year fixed deals at below 2%, he said. Even borrowers with a small deposit can find competitive rates of interest, he added. The Bank expects a fall in UK house prices this year, with property values predicted to drop by 1.25%. It says some households are likely to have delayed moving house because of Brexit uncertainty. It also says that affordability is also slowing the market, particularly in areas where prices are high, such as London and the South East. Last month,the government launched the recruitment process for a new governor for the Bank of England. Mark Carney will step down on 31 January 2020 after more than six years in the post. Interviews will be held over the summer and the appointment will be made by the government in the autumn. The government is under pressure to consider female candidates, as men hold the Bank's key positions. At the moment, the Monetary Policy Committee, which sets interest rates, only has one female among its nine members. When asked about the lack of diversity at the Bank, Mr Carney said ""big progress"" had been made with women now making up 31% of senior management.

The Duke and Duchess of Sussex sent their best wishes to their niece. The couple, awaiting the birth of their own child, replied to a Kensington Palace Instagram post: ""Happy Birthday Charlotte! Lots of love, H and M."" In one of the new images, Charlotte can be seen in a blue flower-print summer dress as she sits on grass at the palace.

"The boy was found injured in the Somerford Grove area of Hackney A teenage boy has been stabbed to death in an attack in Hackney, east London. The 15-year-old victim was found injured in Somerford Grove at about 21:00 BST on Wednesday and died shortly after, police said. A shopkeeper said a boy ran into his store pleading for help, saying he had been stabbed in the back. A second boy, aged 16, found nearby Shacklewell Road, was also stabbed but did not sustain life-threatening injuries. A man from Elif Food Centre, who did not want to be named, told BBC London he tried to help one of the victims. He said: ""One boy came running into the shop last night saying 'I have been stabbed in the back. Help me. Help me.' ""We called an ambulance and now police have seized our CCTV."" Two friends of the victim spoke of their shock after visiting the crime scene. One said: ""It came as a surprise to us because he was a good guy. ""We did music together. He didn't only produce afrobeats, he made drill music as well. He also sold some beats to some big artists. ""I never thought that any of my friends would be murdered. I'm shocked."" The other friend added: ""I saw him the day before yesterday. He was a good friend, a nice lad. ""I'm so done. It doesn't feel safe any more."" The 15-year-old boy is one of the youngest victims to be stabbed to death in London so far this year Police said a Section 60 stop-and-search order had been put in place for the whole of Hackney.

"The boy was found injured in the Somerford Grove area of Hackney A teenage boy has been stabbed to death in an attack in Hackney, east London. The 15-year-old victim was found injured in Somerford Grove at about 21:00 BST on Wednesday and died shortly after, police said. A shopkeeper said a boy ran into his store pleading for help, saying he had been stabbed in the back. A second boy, aged 16, found nearby Shacklewell Road, was also stabbed but did not sustain life-threatening injuries. A man from Elif Food Centre, who did not want to be named, told BBC London he tried to help one of the victims. He said: ""One boy came running into the shop last night saying 'I have been stabbed in the back. Help me. Help me.' ""We called an ambulance and now police have seized our CCTV."" Two friends of the victim spoke of their shock after visiting the crime scene. One said: ""It came as a surprise to us because he was a good guy. ""We did music together. He didn't only produce afrobeats, he made drill music as well. He also sold some beats to some big artists. ""I never thought that any of my friends would be murdered. I'm shocked."" The other friend added: ""I saw him the day before yesterday. He was a good friend, a nice lad. ""I'm so done. It doesn't feel safe any more."" The 15-year-old boy is one of the youngest victims to be stabbed to death in London so far this year Police said a Section 60 stop-and-search order had been put in place for the whole of Hackney. No arrests have been made in connection with the killing.

The Canadian aircraft manufacturer employs about 3,600 people across several locations in Northern Ireland.

'Bombshell' as Bombardier cuts 490 NI jobs Unions consult over Bombardier action It is selling off its aerospace operations in Belfast, Newtownabbey, Newtownards and Dunmurry.

It said Bombardier was committed to finding the right buyer. It added: ""We understand that this announcement may cause concern among our employees, but we will be working closely with them and our unions as matters progress, and through any future transition period to a new owner. ""There are no new workforce announcements as a result of this decision."" Last November, Bombardier said it was to cut a further 490 jobs from its Northern Ireland operations. Business Secretary Greg Clark spoke to representatives of the company before the announcement was made. ""The Belfast plant is one of our most important aerospace facilities in the country and a vital asset in the UK's leading aerospace sector,"" he said in a statement. ""The government will work with potential buyers to take this successful and ambitious business forward."" Speaking on BBC News NI's Talkback programme, Gavin Robinson, MP for East Belfast, said that, in recent years, Bombardier workers have not been able to ""get a break"". He said that ""government has a role to ensure that all avenues are explored"" in relation to the sale. Analysis: John Campbell, BBC News NI economics and business editor It is not yet clear who could buy the Belfast operation but it may be attractive to global engineering firms who are 'Tier 1' aerospace suppliers. Industry watchers point to firms like Spirit Aerosystems or GKN. The Belfast plants don't just make parts for Bombardier, they also supply external customers such as Airbus. Bombardier Belfast director, Michael Ryan, previously said the Belfast factory would be capable of functioning as an outside supplier to Bombardier's business-jets division. Susan Fitzgerald, the regional co-ordinating officer with Unite trade union, said that the Bombardier workforce have been ""bracing for a shock announcement every morning"". ""The sale causes significant uncertainty for workers and members,"" she said. Stephen Kelly of Manufacturing NI warned that, between workers and Bombardier suppliers, the sale will have a direct impact on 12,000 jobs in the Northern Ireland economy. ""It's deeply worrying for the suppliers... and it is deeply worrying for the workers,"" said Mr Kelly. Bombardier, which is based in Montreal, has more than 68,000 employees in 28 countries. Last month, it slashed its full-year revenue forecast from $18bn (Â£13.7bn) to $17bn (Â£13bn) due to timing of aircraft deliveries, production challenges in its train-making division and unfavourable currency conversions. The rail unit is meant to generate $10bn (Â£7.6bn)  but Bombardier has cut its full-year revenue forecast for the division by almost 8% to $8.75bn (Â£6.7bn). Bombardier's president and chief executive Alain Bellemare said that the company expected to meet its aircraft delivery and financial performance targets for the year in its aerospace businesses.

"Elections are held for 248 English councils, six mayors and all 11 councils in Northern Ireland Conservatives and Labour both see vote shares fall compared with 2015 The Tories lose 44 councils and 1,334 seats Theresa May says results message is: ""Just get on and deliver Brexit."" Labour loses six councils and 82 seats Lib Dems take control of 10 councils and won 703 seats Greens and independents also make significant gains Anger over Brexit appears to be influencing voters, say experts Arryn Moy and Hamish Mackay That's the end of our live coverage of the local election for now. Here's a recap of what's happened: You can read a full breakdown of all the results here.  The Daily Express says voters vented their anger at the local elections, sending a clear message to politicians to deliver Brexit. The Guardian says Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn are seeking a cross-party solution to the Brexit deadlock after voters punished both major parties in local elections. The Times claims Theresa May will be told by senior Tories that she must set her departure date next week after the party's drubbing in the local elections. The Daily Telegraph says the Conservatives suffered their worst local election result since ""Tony Blair's humiliation of John Major a quarter of a century ago"". The Daily Mail and the Independent have similar headlines but have interpreted the local election results in very different ways. The Daily Mail says Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn suffered humiliation amid protests over failing to deliver Brexit. The Independent, however, says voters turned to parties backing another referendum on Brexit. The iweekend carries a warning from Home Secretary Sajid Javid, who says that voters will punish his ""divided party"" for breaking trust. The Andrew Marr Show Andrew Marr's guests this weekend to look at the local election results will include shadow chancellor John McDonnell, Scottish Tory leader Ruth Davidson, Green Party co-leader Sian Berry and Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price. Reviewing the Sunday papers will be Amanda Platell and Steve Richards on the Marr Show from 10:00 BST on Sunday. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

With the results for Waverley and Mansfield now in, every council in England has declared. The Conervatives have suffered huge defeats, losing more than 1,300 councillors and 44 councils. And Labour, who had been expected to make gains, instead lost 81 councillors and six councils. Theresa May has said the results show the public want both parties to ""get on"" with Brexit. But the strongly pro-EU Lib Dems gained 700 seats, with leader Sir Vince Cable calling every vote received ""a vote for stopping Brexit"". The Green Party - who are also pro-EU - have picked up an additional 194 seats in comparison to 2015. You can read a full breakdown of all the results here. Antrim and Newtownabbey Borough Council DUP MP Gavin Robinson says it is a ""good news story"" for his party that Allison Bennington has been elected as a councillor. She is the first openly gay candidate to stand for the party. Mr Robinson said: ""If you believe in our party's principles, if you stand for our values, if you are prepared to go forward and seek selection and you are selected and elected by the people - then get on and do the job."" He added: ""We're not a theocracy, we're a political party."" Unsurprisingly, the Guardian focuses on the Conservatives' huge losses, which it says are the party's worst for almost a quarter of a century. It's worth noting that since that tweet was sent, their losses have reached 1,327 seats . Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"Nicola Sturgeon is pressed on currency plans and cuts to Air Departure Tax during FMQs MSPs pass the Health and Care Staffing Bill Louise Wilson and Craig Hutchison That's all from Holyrood Live on Thursday 2 May 2019. Nicola Sturgeon has signalled she could ditch plans to cut air departure tax. The Scottish government has promised to legislate to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to net-zero by 2045. Nicola Sturgeon was challenged on proposals for a devolved air departure tax - which would be 50% lower than the current air passenger duty. Alison Johnstone and Richard Leonard both called on the first minister to scrap the plans. Ms Sturgeon said the government would have to review every policy in order to meet the new climate change targets. ""Setting targets is one thing, having the policy programme in place to meet them is what matters,"" she added. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

MSPs vote unanimously to pass theHealth and Care (Staffing) (Scotland) Bill,external. Lib Dem MSP Alex Cole-Hamilton Lib Dem MSP Alex Cole-Hamilton praises the health secretary for achieving consensus over this bill by working with other parties between Stages 2 and 3. This bill recognises the multi-disciplinary focus needed following the integration of health and social care, he says. The Lib Dem suggests giving senior staff the time and place to get a real strategic overview of wards is one of the most important changes enacted through this bill. Health and care staff do so much for us and it is about time we start doing something for them, he concludes. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The Health and Care (Staffing) (Scotland) Bill seeks to place an existing workforce planning tool onto a statutory footing. It will also see staff planning methods be used on social care settings, such as care homes. Health boards are responsible for assessing the needs of their own populations using a set of 12 tools, which have existed since 2004. These are focused on nursing and midwifery. Should the legislation pass, the tools will become mandatory for health boards and social care providers to use - though it is not yet clear what would happen if they did not meet their duties. Read more about the bill in the SPICe briefing.,external Scottish Green Party parliamentary co-leader Alison Johnstone Scottish Green Party parliamentary co-leader Alison Johnstone says the her party supports the aims of the Health and Social Care (Staffing) (Scotland) Bill. Ms Johnstone highlights the importance of safe staffing levels on patients' health outcomes. She says the protections introduced in this bill are vital to provide high quality and safe patient care. The Green MSP praise Jeane Freeman for working hard to achieve consensus. This bill alone won't help create more health care professionals, she adds, but it is a start. Labour MSP Monica Lennon Labour MSP Monica Lennon welcomes the bill and indeed all attempts to ensure safe staffing. But she warns the bill is not a panacea, adding the healthcare sector is experiencing a staffing and funding crisis. Ms Lennon highlights the passage of amendments to the bill to connect it to workforce planning and improve the wellbeing of NHS staff. Scottish Labour welcome this legislation as a step towards fixing the healthcare crisis which sees staff overworked and under pressure, the Labour health spokesperson concludes. MSPs unanimouslybacked the general principle of the Health and Care (Staffing) (Scotland) Bill on 6 December 2018. The proposed legislation seeks to place an existing workforce planning tool onto a statutory footing. It will also see staff planning methods be used on social care settings, such as care homes. Health boards are responsible for assessing the needs of their own populations using a set of 12 tools, which have existed since 2004. These are focused on nursing and midwifery. Should the legislation pass, the tools will become mandatory for health boards and social care providers to use - though it is not yet clear what would happen if they did not meet their duties. Tory MSP Miles Briggs Miles Briggs says the Scottish Conservatives believe the NHS's most important asset is its people. Mr Briggs insists it is essential that the voices of health professionals has been heard throughout the progress of this bill. The Tory MSP says tools will be developed with the care sector in the future. He concludes saying his party recognise the workforce faces a number of key challenges unless staff shortages are addressed. Safe staffing levels will remain a dream not a reality until that is achieved, he argues. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Health Secretary Jeane Freeman Health Secretary Jeane Freeman explains the bill will put a system-wide approach to assessing workload in the health service into statute. The development of the tools has been evidence-based and professionally led by nurses and midwives, she states. This legislation will extend these core principles across health and social care the health secretary adds. Ms Freeman says the voice of the professional will be heard and will influence staffing decisions, while promoting engagement and transparency. There is a great deal more work to come to ensure the tool keeps on top of advances in care, she says. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The cancer strategy was launched in 2016 and the majority of its actions are on track Staff shortages could derail the Scottish government's Â£100m cancer strategy, a report warned in January. The blueprint for improving care for the 32,000 Scots diagnosed with cancer every year has made significant progress in areas such as prevention and improving survival. But there is a lack of clinicians in key areas such as radiology. This is slowing down the goal of getting more cancers diagnosed and treated quicker. Labour MSP Monica Lennon says her eight amendments in this group seek to add to provisions already in the bill to add the fair work. She says they seek to go some way to defining what fair work and wellbeing requires. It is not acceptable that staff have to pay out of their own pocket for items such as uniform, she argues. Ms Lennon offers to not move her amendments if the cabinet secretary commits to bringing guidance alongside the bill to this effect. Lib Dem MSP Alex Cole-Hamilton says there is a crisis in social care in Edinburgh and more must be done to recognise fair work in the sector to make it more attractive. Jeane Freeman welcomes the intention behind the amendments, insisting the government has done what is can within the powers of the parliament to ensure staff receive a fair level of pay. But for as long as employment law remains reserves, we are restricted in the next steps we can take and Ms Lennon's amendments are outwith the powers of the parliament she warns. If these amendments were passed the entire piece of legislation make be referred to the courts, the health secretary adds. Ms Lennon agrees to withdraw the amendments. Douglas FraserScotland business & economy editor The NHS turned 70 last year, well past the age of having its own bus pass. While most others can retire at that age, the National Health Service is still working. Indeed, it's having to work flat out, and it's feeling the strain. Some of that strain comes from more demands being placed on it. Expectations of what it can achieve are completely different to 1948. And it has to put up with patients, many of whom do a poor job at looking after themselves. A lot of the strain comes from budgets that keep rising but struggle to keep up with numbers of patients and expectations of what can be done.

"There is no clear understanding of what is needed to deliver welfare payments to Scotland's expected 1.4 million claimants, Audit Scotland has said. The warning from the spending watchdog comes as the Scottish government prepares to take over control of 11 benefits from the UK government. So far almost Â£90m has been spent on delivering the new benefits system. However, Audit Scotland said it was still unclear what the overall cost would be. In its report,external, the spending watchdog said that while the delivery of the first two benefits to be taken on by Social Security Scotland had gone well, the real challenge lay ahead. The new benefits - the carer's allowance supplement and best start grants - began being given to claimants in 2018. Figures from Audit Scotland show that Â£33m was paid to 77,000 people receiving the carer's allowance supplement, while Â£2.7m was paid to 7,000 people receiving best start grants. The Scottish government has also spent Â£87m implementing the new system. However, in the report Scotland's auditor general Caroline Gardner warned that while the Scottish government had done a ""good job"" delivering the first two benefits, its second phase of delivery included the most complex and highest risk benefits She also highlighted the difficulties that Social Security Scotland, which is headquartered in Dundee, had encountered employing adequately skilled staff, both in project management and in IT. Social Security Secretary Shirley-Anne Somerville said seven benefits would be implemented by the end of 2019 Ms Gardner said the vacancy rate was 30%, prompting a reliance on agency staff and contractors and pushing up costs. She said: ""The government has done well to date but has had to work flat out to reach this point, leaving little time to draw breath and plan for the challenges ahead. ""The social security team is doing the right things to address that issue, but it hasn't yet got a clear understanding of what's needed to deliver the more complex benefits to come, or how much it will cost."" She told BBC Radio'sGood Morning Scotlandprogramme: ""To put it in context, the benefits that have been delivered so far are about 2% of the total Â£3.5bn that will be involved when it's fully rolled out. ""The government deliberately focused on the benefits that were easier to implement first of all - the one-off payments, the relatively small caseloads and where people's eligibility is easy to assess, new parents for example. ""The disability benefits are very different. More people are involved, assessing eligibility is much more complex and there are regular payments that people will rely on for their living costs, so scaling that up really is a very significant move from the success that has been achieved so far."" Ministers have previously denied theirtimetable for implementing the new benefits' rollout was unrealistic. Social Security Secretary Shirley-Anne Somerville said that the government was already taking action to respond to the Audit Scotland report. She said that they aimed to have delivered three of the 11 devolved benefits by the end of 2019, as well as four new ones to the Scots in most need. She toldGood Morning Scotland: ""I very much welcome the report from Audit Scotland. It has recognised that we've done very well to deliver at that very high pace and with significant challenges. ""The evidence from last year shows that we have been able to establish a new public service for Scotland, we are delivering benefits - there's over Â£197m delivered by Social Security Scotland already directly to low income families and to carers. Ms Somerville said that she recognised there were challenges ahead for the service but that plans to meet them were already well underway. She also said that progress was being made on the department's vacancy rate, which had dropped from 30% to 15% in mid April. On the overall costs of the service, Ms Somerville said: ""The financial memorandum from the social security bill, that was only passed last year, show that the implementation costs were around Â£308m. ""The steady-state running costs for the agency were estimated to be between Â£144m-Â£156m and that replicates and shadows very well what happens within the current system."" The Scottish Conservative spokeswoman for social security, Michelle Ballantyne, said the SNP had spent years complaining about the UK government's approach to benefits but was now finding out how difficult it was to create a fair and sustainable welfare system. She added: ""This report shows that 98% of the annual expenditure on devolved benefits have yet to be delivered. ""They have spent a fortune just to get to this point, and the costs appear to be rising still."" Mark Griffin, Scottish Labour's social security spokesman, said: ""This damning report means that vulnerable people in Scotland will continue to suffer at the hands of the Tories while they wait for a devolved system that was meant to bring dignity and respect. ""The SNP have already chosen to leave Scotland's social security powers at the whims of a Tory government, with some disabled people having to wait up to 2024 for their payments to transfer.""

"Craig Orr is the only male nurse on his ward Craig Orr used to be a police officer but after retiring early he retrained as a nurse. His new career means the 46-year-old, who works at the Royal Victoria Hospital in Kirkcaldy, is ""surrounded by women"". Craig toldBBC Scotland's The Nine: ""There are approximately just over 50 members of staff and I'm the only male nurse here."" It is a similar story at hospitals across Scotland. Last year the number of male nurses fell to a seven-year low, accounting for about 10% of the 65,000 nursing staff across the country. Craig's ex-police officer colleagues can't believe his new career Studies have suggested that men view nursing as a worthwhile career with good progression opportunities. But they perceive a strong societal link between nursing and femininity which deters them from taking it up. An NHS study last year said there was still a ""stigma"" attached to men in nursing and there were not enough role models to challenge this. It also said that focus groups suggested men take longer to mature than women and do not realise that nursing is a suitable career for them at a young age. Craig Orr says that when he bumps into ex-colleagues from the police, they ask what he is doing now. ""I say 'I'm a nurse',"" Craig says. ""They say 'Oh really, I didn't expect that'."" Lee Ormiston is one of five men on his university nursing course Lee Ormiston is a student nurse. He is one of just five men in his year at Dundee University's School of Nursing in Fife. ""I think it is seen as a primarily feminine occupation,"" he says. ""Every TV programme or film you see, it is always a female nurse and you are not so 'macho' being in a nursing profession."" Lee says nursing is not considered 'macho' Over the past decade the number of male nursing students across the country has remained stagnant at about 10%. Recent figures from the Universities and Colleges Admissions Service (UCAS) show male applicants for nursing courses in Scotland were up this year to 410 but they are still down from 460 in 2010. Lee says: ""Because there are not a lot of males already in the profession, that is causing the ones that want to do it not to come into it, because they feel it is not for them."" Dundee University School of Nursing lecturer Richard Craven has been doing research into why men are not applying to do nursing. University lecturer Richard Craven asked football fans about their attitudes to males in nursing Last weekend he went to Raith Rovers against Brechin City to talk to male football fans about nursing. Some said the career was considered feminine and they would not go into it but others agreed there should be more men involved. Mr Craven said: ""From a person-centred care point of view, it gives people choice. ""I'm thinking particularly of experiences I have had in care of older adults, for example, where men of older generations, perhaps affected by things like dementia, might identify more strongly with younger men than they would with a woman carer."" Glasgow Caledonian University is also campaigning to address the gender imbalance in nursing. The message could not be simpler - men are nurses too. Student nurse Lee Ormiston says: ""You can be a man, you can be empathetic, get a career in nursing, help people. Definitely.""

"As a relatively new defence secretary, Gavin Williamson once said that Russia should ""go away and shut up"". Well, the prime minister has told him to go away because in her view, he did not shut up. In a leak investigation, that has broken the precedent of most leak investigations that end up with precisely no result at all, a rapid hunt of just a few days has resulted in the sacking of one of the most senior ministers in government, and one of the few ministers frankly, that the prime minister could more or less rely on. Mr Williamson was for a while chief whip too, the keeper of the government's secrets. And, crucially, one of the few ministers who had good relations with the DUP. Indeed, brokering a deal on Theresa May's behalf in the wreckage of the 2017 general election. But there was also a lot of resentment and frustration in government circles at how he sometimes behaved, suspicion often that he was too quick to seek his own political advantage, too interested in his own future, too entertained by the dark arts of Westminster. That meant that as soon as the Huawei story broke, fingers were being privately pointed to him as the source of the leak. ""Operation get Gav"", as one of his allies described it. Gavin Williamson sacked over Huawei leak Ministers were quick to write to Number 10 demanding a full inquiry, some of them privately fuming that ""it must have been Williamson"". Number 10 now says there was ""compelling evidence"" to prove that it was him. Officials carrying out the inquiry did look at his phone. He did, by his own admission, have a conversation on the particular day with the journalist who broke the story. Downing Street has made a very serious accusation and is sure enough to carry out this sacking. For the prime minister's allies, it will show that she is, despite the political turmoil, still strong enough to move some of her ministers around - to hire and fire. Mr Williamson is strenuously still denying that the leak was anything to do with him at all. There is nothing fond, or anything conciliatory, in either the letter from the prime minister to him, or his reply back to her. Exchange of letters between May and Williamson Profile: Gavin Williamson And having had a fractious relationship with the National Security Adviser and Cabinet Secretary, Sir Mark Sedwill, some of Mr Williamson's friends believe that those looking into the affair were simply too quick to conclude the former defence secretary was responsible, treating him differently in this short investigation, compared to others who were on the list. One senior Conservative also points out a rich irony here, saying: ""A government that governs by open leaking then sacks someone for not being open about their leaking. We have surely moved from the incompetent to the theatre of the absurd!"" These are strange times indeed.

"Ella Kissi-Debrah lived 25m from the South Circular Road in south London A fresh inquest will be held into the death of a nine-year-old girl whose fatal asthma attack may have been linked to air pollution near her home. Ella Kissi-Debrah, who lived near the South Circular Road in Lewisham, south east London, died in 2013 after having seizures for three years. The High Court granted a new inquest after Ella's mother said more evidence had come to light. Rosamund Kissi-Debrah said she was ""delighted"" by the ruling. In a statement, she said she was looking forward to ""finally getting the truth"". ""The past six years of not knowing why my beautiful, bright and bubbly daughter died has been difficult for me and my family, but I hope the new inquest will answer whether air pollution took her away from us,"" she said. ""If it is proved that pollution killed Ella then the government will be forced to sit up and take notice that this hidden but deadly killer is cutting short our children's lives."" Ella had 27 visits to hospital for her asthma attacks Ella was first taken to hospital in 2010 after a coughing fit and subsequently admitted to hospital 27 times. Tracking the toxic air that's killing millions Air pollution: what are the effects on humans? Dad's mission to cut toxic air at school An inquest in 2014, which focused on Ella's medical care, concluded her death was caused by acute respiratory failure and severe asthma. But a 2018 report said it was likely unlawful levels of pollution, which were detected at a monitoring station one mile from Ella's home, contributed to her fatal asthma attack. Rosamund Kissi-Debrah says air pollution is cutting children's lives short Ruling with two other judges that the 2014 conclusions should be quashed, Judge Mark Lucraft QC said: ""In our judgment, the discovery of new evidence makes it necessary in the interests of justice that a fresh inquest be held."" This video can not be played How bad is air pollution? He said Ella's family's lawyers had argued the new evidence demonstrated there was an ""arguable failure"" by the state to comply with its duties under the European Convention on Human Rights, which protects the right to life. Ella may become the first person in the UK for whom air pollution is listed as the cause of death.

"The boy was found injured in the Somerford Grove area of Hackney A teenage boy has been stabbed to death in an attack in Hackney, east London. The 15-year-old victim was found injured in Somerford Grove at about 21:00 BST on Wednesday and died shortly after, police said. A shopkeeper said a boy ran into his store pleading for help, saying he had been stabbed in the back. A second boy, aged 16, found nearby Shacklewell Road, was also stabbed but did not sustain life-threatening injuries. A man from Elif Food Centre, who did not want to be named, told BBC London he tried to help one of the victims. He said: ""One boy came running into the shop last night saying 'I have been stabbed in the back. Help me. Help me.' ""We called an ambulance and now police have seized our CCTV."" Two friends of the victim spoke of their shock after visiting the crime scene. One said: ""It came as a surprise to us because he was a good guy. ""We did music together. He didn't only produce afrobeats, he made drill music as well. He also sold some beats to some big artists. ""I never thought that any of my friends would be murdered. I'm shocked."" The other friend added: ""I saw him the day before yesterday. He was a good friend, a nice lad. ""I'm so done. It doesn't feel safe any more."" The 15-year-old boy is one of the youngest victims to be stabbed to death in London so far this year Police said a Section 60 stop-and-search order had been put in place for the whole of Hackney. No arrests have been made in connection with the killing. Met Commissioner Cressida Dick described it as a ""terrible, terrible thing"" as the force revealed statistics showing a drop in homicides compared to the previous financial year. Data compares 2017-18 and 2018-19 financial years 311Fewer knife crime victims under the age of 25 32Fewer homicide victims Speaking about the latest stabbing in Hackney, Ms Dick said the two boys were with a group of other boys and a girl, adding there was ""some sort of confrontation with another group"". Leigh Milner, BBC News Another boy, aged 16, was found stabbed near the crime scene Just off a busy main road there is a huge cordon surrounding the Somerford Grove estate. Elif Food Centre, a 24-hour off-licence, is also taped off as police officers stand guard. Right in the middle of the cordon a big blue tent can be seen - the spot where the victim died. Residents have been telling me they are shocked and scared as only six days ago another person was stabbed to death in Hackney. Hours later, officers were called to another, unrelated, stabbing near Camden Town Tube station. A man suffered ""life-threatening"" injuries in the attack on Camden Road shortly after midnight. So far this year, more than 40 murder investigations have been launched in the capital by the Metropolitan Police and British Transport Police. Twenty-nine of those cases are stabbing investigations. London mayor Sadiq Khan said he was ""deeply saddened"" by the latest killing. ""This horrific violence has absolutely no place on our streets,"" he said.

"Ella Kissi-Debrah lived 25m from the South Circular Road in south London A fresh inquest will be held into the death of a nine-year-old girl whose fatal asthma attack may have been linked to air pollution near her home. Ella Kissi-Debrah, who lived near the South Circular Road in Lewisham, south east London, died in 2013 after having seizures for three years. The High Court granted a new inquest after Ella's mother said more evidence had come to light. Rosamund Kissi-Debrah said she was ""delighted"" by the ruling. In a statement, she said she was looking forward to ""finally getting the truth"". ""The past six years of not knowing why my beautiful, bright and bubbly daughter died has been difficult for me and my family, but I hope the new inquest will answer whether air pollution took her away from us,"" she said. ""If it is proved that pollution killed Ella then the government will be forced to sit up and take notice that this hidden but deadly killer is cutting short our children's lives."" Ella had 27 visits to hospital for her asthma attacks Ella was first taken to hospital in 2010 after a coughing fit and subsequently admitted to hospital 27 times. Tracking the toxic air that's killing millions Air pollution: what are the effects on humans? Dad's mission to cut toxic air at school An inquest in 2014, which focused on Ella's medical care, concluded her death was caused by acute respiratory failure and severe asthma. But a 2018 report said it was likely unlawful levels of pollution, which were detected at a monitoring station one mile from Ella's home, contributed to her fatal asthma attack. Rosamund Kissi-Debrah says air pollution is cutting children's lives short Ruling with two other judges that the 2014 conclusions should be quashed, Judge Mark Lucraft QC said: ""In our judgment, the discovery of new evidence makes it necessary in the interests of justice that a fresh inquest be held."" This video can not be played How bad is air pollution? He said Ella's family's lawyers had argued the new evidence demonstrated there was an ""arguable failure"" by the state to comply with its duties under the European Convention on Human Rights, which protects the right to life. Ella may become the first person in the UK for whom air pollution is listed as the cause of death.

"The ship is reportedly the Freewinds, shown here docked in Aruba in 2014 A US cruise ship has been placed in quarantine by the Caribbean island of St Lucia after a case of measles was reported on board, the island's chief medical officer said. Dr Merlene Fredericks James said there was a confirmed case of measles on board and ""thought it prudent that we quarantine the ship"". No-one aboard was allowed to leave. The ship is reportedly the Freewinds, which is said to be owned and operated by the Church of Scientology. Dr Fredericks James said in a video statement posted on YouTube on Tuesday that the ministry learned of the confirmed measles case from ""two reputable sources"". Allow YouTube content?

She cited the fact that measles was a highly infectious disease as a factor in the decision. ""One infected person can easily infect others through coughing, sneezing, droplets being on various surfaces, etc. So because of the risk of potential infection - not just from the confirmed measles case, but from other persons who may be on the boat at the time - we thought it prudent to make a decision not to allow anyone to disembark."" She also citedthe current situation in the US, where cases of the disease are at a 25-year high, as another factor. St Lucia country profile NBC News, citing a St Lucia Coast Guard, reported that the boat is the Freewinds, a 440ft (134m) vessel owned and operated by the Church of Scientology, thought to have some 300 passengers on board. ""The ship's doctor has the confirmed case in isolation on the ship,"" Dr Fredericks James was quoted as saying by NBC. ""The individual is in stable condition."" The St Lucian authorities do not have the authority to keep the ship from leaving, and it is currently due to leave the island at 23:59 (03:59 GMT) on Thursday, NBC reports officials as saying. The ship-tracking website MarineTraffic.com shows a ship called SMV Freewinds docked in Castries,external, the country's capital. The Church of Scientology has so far not publicly commented on the case. Earlier this week, US health officials reported that more than 700 people had been infected by measles this year, marking a 25-year high for cases of the infectious disease in the country. This video can not be played BBC health correspondent Smitha Mundasad explains the US measles outbreak Cases had been recorded in 22 states and were mostly affecting unvaccinated children, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said on Monday. Officials said the increase in cases is the largest since 1994, including 78 reported in the past week. Some parents are said to have chosen to leave their children unvaccinated due to the unscientific claim that vaccines cause illnesses such as autism, or on religious grounds. Most cases occurred in 13 outbreak zones, including in New York City's orthodox Jewish communities.

"Sociology student Amna Atteeq says positive role models are crucial Universities must ""accelerate efforts"" to close a gap in degree attainment between white and black, Asian and minority ethnic students, a study says. Universities UK and the National Union of Students highlight a 13% gap between the chances of white and BAME students getting a first or upper second degree. UUK and the NUS say campuses need a culture change to feel more inclusive. ""To make sure our gap closes, there need to be initiatives,"" says Aston University student Amna Atteeq. ""And we are more than happy to get involved,"" says Amna, who contributed to the UUK and NUS research. ""But we need to know where we need to start and what we need to look for. We want university support looking at the curriculum, at other staff members at the university or at having other talks from people who have succeeded in careers and bringing them back to inspire our students."" Ethnicity pay gap for academics revealed 'I'm mixed-race, is Cambridge right for me?' Should race count in university admissions? Joel Simpson, from the University of the Arts in London, who also contributed to the research, added: ""I think it's definitely key that the staff interrogate the data behind attainment gaps. ""But they need to understand the nuances, the factors that lead to those attainment gaps. That can only really be gained by immersing themselves within the student body, getting a clear understanding of students' day-to-day lives and how students move through the college. ""Sometimes it can be the smallest things that affect a student's mindset."" Joel Simpson says subtle issues are important For Amna, who is coming towards the end of her term as Student Union president at Aston, giving BAME students good role models is crucial to raising aspirations. ""I think there's this unconscious bias with students that, if they don't see their role models in certain careers at university or in certain careers, in companies, they automatically take them out of line of their future career. ""And for us to tackle that, it's really important to have certain role models at university, or bring people on board through talks, to show our students that they have made it in certain companies or career paths."" The report acknowledges that many universities have worked to reduce the attainment gap, but says that with 81% of white students getting a first or 2:1 in 2017-18 compared with 68% of BAME students, more must be done. It highlights five ways that universities can improve outcomes: provide strong leadership - university leaders should demonstrate a commitment to removing the BAME attainment gap and lead by example have conversations about race and changing cultures develop racially diverse and inclusive environments, ensuring that BAME students have a good sense of belonging gather and analyse data on the attainment gap understand what works - universities can share evidence of what works and what does not UUK is asking vice-chancellors to sign up to an online pledge to work with students. Meanwhile, the Office for Students (OfS) has set a target for the higher education sector to eliminate the unexplained gap in degree outcomes by 2024-25. Baroness Amos, director of SOAS, who co-led the report, said: ""Our universities are racially and culturally diverse, compared to many other sectors, but we are failing a generation of students if we don't act now to reduce the BAME attainment gap. ""It is important that universities act and are transparent in their approach so black, Asian and minority ethnic students are given the best chance of success."" Amatey Doku, NUS vice-president for higher education, said that universities had presided over significant gaps in attainment between BAME students and white students ""for far too long"". ""From decolonising the curriculum to more culturally competent support services, many students and students' unions have been fighting and campaigning for action in this area for years. ""This report highlights good practice and clear practical steps for universities to take to begin to respond to many of the concerns raised."" Chris Millward, director for fair access and participation at the OfS, said the report was ""welcome and timely"". ""The OfS has set a target for the higher education sector to eliminate the unexplained gap in degree outcomes between white and black students by 2024-25. ""In order to do this, universities must take urgent action to understand what is causing these differences, and reduce the gaps so that all students - whatever their background - are given every opportunity to reap the rewards that higher education can bring.""

"Voters are continuing to head to the polls for council and mayoral elections across England and Northern Ireland. Elections are being held for 248 English councils, six mayors and all 11 councils in Northern Ireland. Polling stations for the votes - spanning metropolitan and district councils and unitary authorities - are open until 22:00 BST. No local elections are taking place in Scotland and Wales. Live coverage as voters go to the polls How the BBC reports polling day What can you not do in a polling station? Which elections are taking place in May? This is the biggest set of local elections in England's four-year electoral cycle, with more than 8,400 seats being contested. A further 462 seats are up for grabs in Northern Ireland.   By-elections can take place in some council wards even if that council is not scheduled for elections this year. Check your council website for details. Voters in 10 local authorities in England need to either show ID or produce their polling card before they can vote as part of a trial scheme. Those in Braintree, Broxtowe, Craven, Derby, North Kesteven, Woking and Pendle have to show ID before they can vote. Voters in Mid Sussex, North West Leicestershire, and Watford local authorities are required to show their polling card. Everyone else in England can vote as usual, with no need to bring along a polling card or any proof of ID. But in Northern Ireland, voters need photo ID, the polling card received through the post being for information purposes only. Results for about 108 English councils are expected to be declared before 06:00 on Friday. The remaining 140 are scheduled to come in throughout Friday, mostly between midday and 1800 BST. The Northern Irish results will take longer to come through because of a more complicated voting system.

"This video can not be played Tear gas and water cannon hit Venezuela protesters on Wednesday A woman was shot dead and dozens injured in the Venezuelan capital Caracas on Wednesday, in clashes between opposition supporters and pro-government forces. The military fired tear gas and water cannon amid rival demonstrations. Opposition leader Juan GuaidÃ³ called for those responsible for the death of a 27-year-old woman to be found. He also urged public employees to go on strike on Thursday, to try to force President NicolÃ¡s Maduro to stand down. In January, Mr GuaidÃ³ declared himself Venezuela's interim leader, and he has been recognised by more than 50 countries including the US, UK and most Latin America nations. As the head of the opposition-controlled National Assembly, he invoked the constitution to assume an interim presidency, arguing that Mr Maduro's re-election last year was illegitimate. But Mr Maduro - who is backed by Russia, China and the leaders of Venezuela's military - has refused to cede power. Venezuela crisis in 300 words Who is Juan GuaidÃ³? Profile: NicolÃ¡s Maduro The president dismissed suggestions he had been ready to flee the country and accused the US of directing an attempted coup. Those involved would be punished, he said. On Wednesday, both pro- and anti-government supporters held demonstrations in Caracas that were initially peaceful. There were reports of gunfire in the city, and a local NGO, the Venezuelan Observatory of Social Conflict, said Jurubith Rausseo, 27, had been shot dead during a rally in the opposition stronghold of Altamira. At least 46 people were injured in clashes between opposition supporters and the security forces. This video can not be played Military vehicles were filmed driving into demonstrators on Tuesday On Tuesday,Mr GuaidÃ³ posted a video showing him with a number of men in military uniform. He said he had the support of ""brave soldiers"" in Caracas. Is there a new cult of personality in Venezuela? How much aid is getting into Venezuela? Who is buying Venezuela's oil? He urged Venezuelans to join them in the streets, and appeared alongside another opposition leader, Leopoldo LÃ³pez, who had been under house arrest after being found guilty of inciting violence during protests in 2014. Spain's government later said that Mr LÃ³pez and his family had sought safety in their embassy, but said the opposition figure has not claimed political asylum. Supporters on both sides gathered around the city throughout Tuesday, and there were clashes between Mr GuaidÃ³'s supporters and armed military vehicles. In a series of tweets (in Spanish), Mr GuaidÃ³ said the final phase of ""Operation Liberty"" had begun and it was the turn of public workers to join in. He urged protesters to stay on the streets until Mr Maduro's government would be finally forced to resign. Mr GuaidÃ³ has been courting the public sector for weeks - but winning their support will be difficult, the BBC's Americas editor Candace Piette says. For years, state employees have been told that if they did not turn up at government rallies, they would lose their jobs. So if the opposition leader does win them over, it will be a huge victory against President Maduro, our editor says. Mr Maduro also addressed his supporters in the capital Tensions are rising between the US and Russia over the crisis. US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the US may take military action to resolve the crisis, and accused Russia and Cuba of destabilising the country through their support for Mr Maduro. The US also reiterated its support for Mr GuaidÃ³. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov told Mr Pompeo that America's influence over Venezuela was destructive and a violation of international law.

"Elections are held for 248 English councils, six mayors and all 11 councils in Northern Ireland Conservatives and Labour both see vote shares fall compared with 2015 The Tories lose 44 councils and 1,334 seats Theresa May says results message is: ""Just get on and deliver Brexit."" Labour loses six councils and 82 seats Lib Dems take control of 10 councils and won 703 seats Greens and independents also make significant gains Anger over Brexit appears to be influencing voters, say experts Arryn Moy and Hamish Mackay That's the end of our live coverage of the local election for now. Here's a recap of what's happened: You can read a full breakdown of all the results here.  The Daily Express says voters vented their anger at the local elections, sending a clear message to politicians to deliver Brexit. The Guardian says Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn are seeking a cross-party solution to the Brexit deadlock after voters punished both major parties in local elections. The Times claims Theresa May will be told by senior Tories that she must set her departure date next week after the party's drubbing in the local elections. The Daily Telegraph says the Conservatives suffered their worst local election result since ""Tony Blair's humiliation of John Major a quarter of a century ago"". The Daily Mail and the Independent have similar headlines but have interpreted the local election results in very different ways. The Daily Mail says Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn suffered humiliation amid protests over failing to deliver Brexit. The Independent, however, says voters turned to parties backing another referendum on Brexit. The iweekend carries a warning from Home Secretary Sajid Javid, who says that voters will punish his ""divided party"" for breaking trust. The Andrew Marr Show Andrew Marr's guests this weekend to look at the local election results will include shadow chancellor John McDonnell, Scottish Tory leader Ruth Davidson, Green Party co-leader Sian Berry and Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price. Reviewing the Sunday papers will be Amanda Platell and Steve Richards on the Marr Show from 10:00 BST on Sunday. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

With the results for Waverley and Mansfield now in, every council in England has declared. The Conervatives have suffered huge defeats, losing more than 1,300 councillors and 44 councils. And Labour, who had been expected to make gains, instead lost 81 councillors and six councils. Theresa May has said the results show the public want both parties to ""get on"" with Brexit. But the strongly pro-EU Lib Dems gained 700 seats, with leader Sir Vince Cable calling every vote received ""a vote for stopping Brexit"". The Green Party - who are also pro-EU - have picked up an additional 194 seats in comparison to 2015. You can read a full breakdown of all the results here. Antrim and Newtownabbey Borough Council DUP MP Gavin Robinson says it is a ""good news story"" for his party that Allison Bennington has been elected as a councillor. She is the first openly gay candidate to stand for the party. Mr Robinson said: ""If you believe in our party's principles, if you stand for our values, if you are prepared to go forward and seek selection and you are selected and elected by the people - then get on and do the job."" He added: ""We're not a theocracy, we're a political party."" Unsurprisingly, the Guardian focuses on the Conservatives' huge losses, which it says are the party's worst for almost a quarter of a century. It's worth noting that since that tweet was sent, their losses have reached 1,327 seats . Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"This video can not be played Tear gas and water cannon hit Venezuela protesters on Wednesday A woman was shot dead and dozens injured in the Venezuelan capital Caracas on Wednesday, in clashes between opposition supporters and pro-government forces. The military fired tear gas and water cannon amid rival demonstrations. Opposition leader Juan GuaidÃ³ called for those responsible for the death of a 27-year-old woman to be found. He also urged public employees to go on strike on Thursday, to try to force President NicolÃ¡s Maduro to stand down. In January, Mr GuaidÃ³ declared himself Venezuela's interim leader, and he has been recognised by more than 50 countries including the US, UK and most Latin America nations. As the head of the opposition-controlled National Assembly, he invoked the constitution to assume an interim presidency, arguing that Mr Maduro's re-election last year was illegitimate. But Mr Maduro - who is backed by Russia, China and the leaders of Venezuela's military - has refused to cede power. Venezuela crisis in 300 words Who is Juan GuaidÃ³? Profile: NicolÃ¡s Maduro The president dismissed suggestions he had been ready to flee the country and accused the US of directing an attempted coup. Those involved would be punished, he said. On Wednesday, both pro- and anti-government supporters held demonstrations in Caracas that were initially peaceful. There were reports of gunfire in the city, and a local NGO, the Venezuelan Observatory of Social Conflict, said Jurubith Rausseo, 27, had been shot dead during a rally in the opposition stronghold of Altamira. At least 46 people were injured in clashes between opposition supporters and the security forces. This video can not be played Military vehicles were filmed driving into demonstrators on Tuesday On Tuesday,Mr GuaidÃ³ posted a video showing him with a number of men in military uniform. He said he had the support of ""brave soldiers"" in Caracas. Is there a new cult of personality in Venezuela? How much aid is getting into Venezuela? Who is buying Venezuela's oil? He urged Venezuelans to join them in the streets, and appeared alongside another opposition leader, Leopoldo LÃ³pez, who had been under house arrest after being found guilty of inciting violence during protests in 2014. Spain's government later said that Mr LÃ³pez and his family had sought safety in their embassy, but said the opposition figure has not claimed political asylum. Supporters on both sides gathered around the city throughout Tuesday, and there were clashes between Mr GuaidÃ³'s supporters and armed military vehicles. In a series of tweets (in Spanish), Mr GuaidÃ³ said the final phase of ""Operation Liberty"" had begun and it was the turn of public workers to join in. He urged protesters to stay on the streets until Mr Maduro's government would be finally forced to resign. Mr GuaidÃ³ has been courting the public sector for weeks - but winning their support will be difficult, the BBC's Americas editor Candace Piette says. For years, state employees have been told that if they did not turn up at government rallies, they would lose their jobs. So if the opposition leader does win them over, it will be a huge victory against President Maduro, our editor says. Mr Maduro also addressed his supporters in the capital Tensions are rising between the US and Russia over the crisis. US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the US may take military action to resolve the crisis, and accused Russia and Cuba of destabilising the country through their support for Mr Maduro. The US also reiterated its support for Mr GuaidÃ³. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov told Mr Pompeo that America's influence over Venezuela was destructive and a violation of international law. UN Secretary General AntÃ³nio Guterres has appealed for both sides in Venezuela to avoid violence, whilethe EU has called for ""utmost restraint to avoid the loss of lives and an escalation in tensions"",external. This video can not be played Why Venezuela matters to the US... and vice versa Governments who still back Mr Maduro - including Bolivia and Cuba - condemned Mr GuaidÃ³'s efforts as an attempted coup. The Mexican government expressed ""concern about a possible increase in violence"" while Colombian President Ivan Duque urged the Venezuelan military to stand ""on the right side of history"" against Mr Maduro.

"There is no clear understanding of what is needed to deliver welfare payments to Scotland's expected 1.4 million claimants, Audit Scotland has said. The warning from the spending watchdog comes as the Scottish government prepares to take over control of 11 benefits from the UK government. So far almost Â£90m has been spent on delivering the new benefits system. However, Audit Scotland said it was still unclear what the overall cost would be. In its report,external, the spending watchdog said that while the delivery of the first two benefits to be taken on by Social Security Scotland had gone well, the real challenge lay ahead. The new benefits - the carer's allowance supplement and best start grants - began being given to claimants in 2018. Figures from Audit Scotland show that Â£33m was paid to 77,000 people receiving the carer's allowance supplement, while Â£2.7m was paid to 7,000 people receiving best start grants. The Scottish government has also spent Â£87m implementing the new system. However, in the report Scotland's auditor general Caroline Gardner warned that while the Scottish government had done a ""good job"" delivering the first two benefits, its second phase of delivery included the most complex and highest risk benefits She also highlighted the difficulties that Social Security Scotland, which is headquartered in Dundee, had encountered employing adequately skilled staff, both in project management and in IT. Social Security Secretary Shirley-Anne Somerville said seven benefits would be implemented by the end of 2019 Ms Gardner said the vacancy rate was 30%, prompting a reliance on agency staff and contractors and pushing up costs. She said: ""The government has done well to date but has had to work flat out to reach this point, leaving little time to draw breath and plan for the challenges ahead. ""The social security team is doing the right things to address that issue, but it hasn't yet got a clear understanding of what's needed to deliver the more complex benefits to come, or how much it will cost."" She told BBC Radio'sGood Morning Scotlandprogramme: ""To put it in context, the benefits that have been delivered so far are about 2% of the total Â£3.5bn that will be involved when it's fully rolled out. ""The government deliberately focused on the benefits that were easier to implement first of all - the one-off payments, the relatively small caseloads and where people's eligibility is easy to assess, new parents for example. ""The disability benefits are very different. More people are involved, assessing eligibility is much more complex and there are regular payments that people will rely on for their living costs, so scaling that up really is a very significant move from the success that has been achieved so far."" Ministers have previously denied theirtimetable for implementing the new benefits' rollout was unrealistic. Social Security Secretary Shirley-Anne Somerville said that the government was already taking action to respond to the Audit Scotland report. She said that they aimed to have delivered three of the 11 devolved benefits by the end of 2019, as well as four new ones to the Scots in most need. She toldGood Morning Scotland: ""I very much welcome the report from Audit Scotland. It has recognised that we've done very well to deliver at that very high pace and with significant challenges. ""The evidence from last year shows that we have been able to establish a new public service for Scotland, we are delivering benefits - there's over Â£197m delivered by Social Security Scotland already directly to low income families and to carers. Ms Somerville said that she recognised there were challenges ahead for the service but that plans to meet them were already well underway. She also said that progress was being made on the department's vacancy rate, which had dropped from 30% to 15% in mid April. On the overall costs of the service, Ms Somerville said: ""The financial memorandum from the social security bill, that was only passed last year, show that the implementation costs were around Â£308m. ""The steady-state running costs for the agency were estimated to be between Â£144m-Â£156m and that replicates and shadows very well what happens within the current system."" The Scottish Conservative spokeswoman for social security, Michelle Ballantyne, said the SNP had spent years complaining about the UK government's approach to benefits but was now finding out how difficult it was to create a fair and sustainable welfare system. She added: ""This report shows that 98% of the annual expenditure on devolved benefits have yet to be delivered. ""They have spent a fortune just to get to this point, and the costs appear to be rising still."" Mark Griffin, Scottish Labour's social security spokesman, said: ""This damning report means that vulnerable people in Scotland will continue to suffer at the hands of the Tories while they wait for a devolved system that was meant to bring dignity and respect. ""The SNP have already chosen to leave Scotland's social security powers at the whims of a Tory government, with some disabled people having to wait up to 2024 for their payments to transfer.""

"Sociology student Amna Atteeq says positive role models are crucial Universities must ""accelerate efforts"" to close a gap in degree attainment between white and black, Asian and minority ethnic students, a study says. Universities UK and the National Union of Students highlight a 13% gap between the chances of white and BAME students getting a first or upper second degree. UUK and the NUS say campuses need a culture change to feel more inclusive. ""To make sure our gap closes, there need to be initiatives,"" says Aston University student Amna Atteeq. ""And we are more than happy to get involved,"" says Amna, who contributed to the UUK and NUS research. ""But we need to know where we need to start and what we need to look for. We want university support looking at the curriculum, at other staff members at the university or at having other talks from people who have succeeded in careers and bringing them back to inspire our students."" Ethnicity pay gap for academics revealed 'I'm mixed-race, is Cambridge right for me?' Should race count in university admissions? Joel Simpson, from the University of the Arts in London, who also contributed to the research, added: ""I think it's definitely key that the staff interrogate the data behind attainment gaps. ""But they need to understand the nuances, the factors that lead to those attainment gaps. That can only really be gained by immersing themselves within the student body, getting a clear understanding of students' day-to-day lives and how students move through the college. ""Sometimes it can be the smallest things that affect a student's mindset."" Joel Simpson says subtle issues are important For Amna, who is coming towards the end of her term as Student Union president at Aston, giving BAME students good role models is crucial to raising aspirations. ""I think there's this unconscious bias with students that, if they don't see their role models in certain careers at university or in certain careers, in companies, they automatically take them out of line of their future career. ""And for us to tackle that, it's really important to have certain role models at university, or bring people on board through talks, to show our students that they have made it in certain companies or career paths."" The report acknowledges that many universities have worked to reduce the attainment gap, but says that with 81% of white students getting a first or 2:1 in 2017-18 compared with 68% of BAME students, more must be done. It highlights five ways that universities can improve outcomes: provide strong leadership - university leaders should demonstrate a commitment to removing the BAME attainment gap and lead by example have conversations about race and changing cultures develop racially diverse and inclusive environments, ensuring that BAME students have a good sense of belonging gather and analyse data on the attainment gap understand what works - universities can share evidence of what works and what does not UUK is asking vice-chancellors to sign up to an online pledge to work with students. Meanwhile, the Office for Students (OfS) has set a target for the higher education sector to eliminate the unexplained gap in degree outcomes by 2024-25. Baroness Amos, director of SOAS, who co-led the report, said: ""Our universities are racially and culturally diverse, compared to many other sectors, but we are failing a generation of students if we don't act now to reduce the BAME attainment gap. ""It is important that universities act and are transparent in their approach so black, Asian and minority ethnic students are given the best chance of success."" Amatey Doku, NUS vice-president for higher education, said that universities had presided over significant gaps in attainment between BAME students and white students ""for far too long"". ""From decolonising the curriculum to more culturally competent support services, many students and students' unions have been fighting and campaigning for action in this area for years. ""This report highlights good practice and clear practical steps for universities to take to begin to respond to many of the concerns raised."" Chris Millward, director for fair access and participation at the OfS, said the report was ""welcome and timely"". ""The OfS has set a target for the higher education sector to eliminate the unexplained gap in degree outcomes between white and black students by 2024-25. ""In order to do this, universities must take urgent action to understand what is causing these differences, and reduce the gaps so that all students - whatever their background - are given every opportunity to reap the rewards that higher education can bring.""

"As a relatively new defence secretary, Gavin Williamson once said that Russia should ""go away and shut up"". Well, the prime minister has told him to go away because in her view, he did not shut up. In a leak investigation, that has broken the precedent of most leak investigations that end up with precisely no result at all, a rapid hunt of just a few days has resulted in the sacking of one of the most senior ministers in government, and one of the few ministers frankly, that the prime minister could more or less rely on. Mr Williamson was for a while chief whip too, the keeper of the government's secrets. And, crucially, one of the few ministers who had good relations with the DUP. Indeed, brokering a deal on Theresa May's behalf in the wreckage of the 2017 general election. But there was also a lot of resentment and frustration in government circles at how he sometimes behaved, suspicion often that he was too quick to seek his own political advantage, too interested in his own future, too entertained by the dark arts of Westminster. That meant that as soon as the Huawei story broke, fingers were being privately pointed to him as the source of the leak. ""Operation get Gav"", as one of his allies described it. Gavin Williamson sacked over Huawei leak Ministers were quick to write to Number 10 demanding a full inquiry, some of them privately fuming that ""it must have been Williamson"". Number 10 now says there was ""compelling evidence"" to prove that it was him. Officials carrying out the inquiry did look at his phone. He did, by his own admission, have a conversation on the particular day with the journalist who broke the story. Downing Street has made a very serious accusation and is sure enough to carry out this sacking. For the prime minister's allies, it will show that she is, despite the political turmoil, still strong enough to move some of her ministers around - to hire and fire. Mr Williamson is strenuously still denying that the leak was anything to do with him at all. There is nothing fond, or anything conciliatory, in either the letter from the prime minister to him, or his reply back to her. Exchange of letters between May and Williamson Profile: Gavin Williamson And having had a fractious relationship with the National Security Adviser and Cabinet Secretary, Sir Mark Sedwill, some of Mr Williamson's friends believe that those looking into the affair were simply too quick to conclude the former defence secretary was responsible, treating him differently in this short investigation, compared to others who were on the list. One senior Conservative also points out a rich irony here, saying: ""A government that governs by open leaking then sacks someone for not being open about their leaking. We have surely moved from the incompetent to the theatre of the absurd!"" These are strange times indeed.

"Climate change campaigners have staged protests in Edinburgh The Scottish government will legislate to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to net-zero by 2045 after receiving fresh advice from an expert panel. The Committee on Climate Change,external(CCC) urged that Scotland set the targetfive years ahead of the UK as a whole. The panel says Scotland has more potential sites for carbon capture and a greater landmass for tree planting. It came after a report to the UN last year urged the world to go ""further and faster"" in tackling climate change. And on SundayFirst Minister Nicola Sturgeon declared a ""climate emergency""in her speech to the SNP party conference. Net-zero is the point where the same volume of greenhouse gases is being emitted as is being absorbed through offsetting techniques like forestry. What is climate emergency? What is climate change? Where we are in seven charts and what you can do to help Despite being low-tech, trees are still the most powerful tool in removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere through photosynthesis which turns the gas into oxygen. Scotland has potential sites for carbon capture Committee chairman Lord Deben said: ""Scotland has been a leader within the UK with many of its policies to tackle climate change. ""By setting a strong net-zero target for 2045 it can continue that leadership on the world stage. ""It will be tough, but it can be done and Scotland's strong track record positions it well to succeed."" The terms carbon neutral and net-zero are often used interchangeably but there are differences. Carbon dioxide (CO2) is the most abundant greenhouse gas but there are others which the Scottish government counts and they are not all carbon-based. Therefore, some climate change campaigners prefer the term net-zero as it includes not just CO2 and methane but also nitrous oxide, which is emitted during agricultural and industrial activities as well as from fossil fuels. Simply being carbon neutral would not stop global warming because these other gases are also harmful to the atmosphere. Perhaps an even better term would be ""climate neutral"". Scotland's current target, set in the Climate Change Act, is to reduce emissions by 80% by 2050 compared with benchmark levels from 1990. A new bill currently going through the Scottish Parliament aims to increase that target to 90%. It will now be amended so MSPs can vote on the new target of net-zero by 2045. Trees are a powerful tool to remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere Ministers have said they would aim for net-zero when there is a ""credible pathway to achieve it"". Scotland's environment secretary Roseanna Cunningham said: ""There is a global climate emergency and people across Scotland have been calling, rightly, for more ambition to tackle it and safeguard our planet for future generations. ""Having received independent, expert advice that even higher targets are now possible, and given the urgency required on this issue, I have acted immediately to set a target for net-zero greenhouse gas emissions for 2045 which will see Scotland become carbon neutral by 2040."" She called on the UK government to follow Scotland's lead and warned that everyone needs to take action, including businesses, schools and communities. Nicola Sturgeon was questioned about plans to cut aviation tax During First Minister's Questions, Nicola Sturgeon was challenged on proposals for a devolved air departure tax - which would be 50% lower than the current air passenger duty. Last month theScottish government said legal issues surrounding the plans would not be resolved until after April 2020. Alison Johnstone of the Scottish Greens called on Ms Sturgeon to abandon the ""unfair and environmentally damaging"" proposals. She said the money should instead be invested in active travel and public transport. Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard also urged Ms Sturgeon to drop her commitment to the plans ""once and for all"". The first minister stressed that the cut in aviation tax was not going ahead this year. She said the government would have to review every policy in order to meet the new climate change targets. ""Setting targets is one thing, having the policy programme in place to meet them is what matters,"" she added. The CCC advice recommends a net-zero target of 2050 for the UK as a whole, with Wales urged to reduce emissions by 95% in the same time-frame. To achieve it, the report says a fifth of agricultural land needs to shift to alternative uses that support emissions reductions such as forestry or biomass production. It adds that carbon capture and storage would be crucial. Climate change food calculator: What's your diet's carbon footprint? Ten simple ways to act on climate change How can I help? As well as the 2045 aim, the committee advises interim targets of a 70% reduction in emissions by 2030 and a 90% drop by 2040. In the most recent audit, for 2016, Scottish emissions were 49% below 1990 levels. The CCC calculates that the new target can be achieved at an annual cost of around 1-2% of GDP. A drop in the cost of technologies like offshore wind and batteries for electric vehicles means that is a similar price tag as the one previously attached to the 80% target. Thousands of Scottish school pupils took part in climate protests last month The UK government's energy minister Greg Clark said the CCC report ""recognises the work we've done to lay the foundations to build a net-zero economy"". He added: ""Few subjects unite people across generations and borders like climate change and I share the passion of those wanting to halt its catastrophic effects. ""One of our proudest achievements as a country is our position as a world-leader in tackling this global challenge - being the first country to raise the issue on the international stage, introduce long-term legally-binding climate reduction targets and cutting emissions further than all other G20 countries.""

The industry body Oil & Gas UK said it was committed to working with both governments on a practical response to the report. Chief executive Deirdre Michie said the reductions must be achieved ""without sacrificing security and affordability of energy supply for consumers"" and in ways which ""do not disadvantage UK industries against their international competitors"". Mike Robinson from Stop Climate Chaos Scotland said the CCC report was ""hugely welcome advice"". The cost of the technology for electric vehicles is falling ""The growing climate movement, from NGOs, youth strikes to Extinction Rebellion, is sending a strong message to our political leaders that rhetoric just isn't good enough,"" he added. ""It's now up to MSPs to show they are listening to public concern and reflect the ambition of this exciting report in the Climate Change Bill currently going through parliament."" The CCC calls for the new targets to be achieved purely through domestic efforts. Some countries, like Norway and Sweden, fund international offsetting schemes which count towards their measurements. It also says the target can only be achieved if policy delivery is ramped up significantly,including an earlier deadline than 2040- as the UK government has proposed - for the phase-out of fossil fuel cars. Creating new forests through afforestation also needs to increase to 20,000 hectares a year across the UK, increasing to 27,000 by 2027.

"As a relatively new defence secretary, Gavin Williamson once said that Russia should ""go away and shut up"". Well, the prime minister has told him to go away because in her view, he did not shut up. In a leak investigation, that has broken the precedent of most leak investigations that end up with precisely no result at all, a rapid hunt of just a few days has resulted in the sacking of one of the most senior ministers in government, and one of the few ministers frankly, that the prime minister could more or less rely on. Mr Williamson was for a while chief whip too, the keeper of the government's secrets. And, crucially, one of the few ministers who had good relations with the DUP. Indeed, brokering a deal on Theresa May's behalf in the wreckage of the 2017 general election. But there was also a lot of resentment and frustration in government circles at how he sometimes behaved, suspicion often that he was too quick to seek his own political advantage, too interested in his own future, too entertained by the dark arts of Westminster.

"Network Rail's former properties are home to a wide variety of businesses Network Rail only considered tenants of its arches ""late in the process"" when it sold its commercial property portfolio, the spending watchdog says. The National Audit Office (NAO) said the Â£1.46bn generated by the deal in September was ""more than expected"". But it said that tenants got no legal guarantees on the amount of rent they pay from the new owners. The government says all tenants' rights have been protected - but campaigners warned firms could be priced out. Leni Jones, director of Guardians of the Arches, said: ""[The NAO's] report confirms that tenants' interests were only considered during the sale process because we forced Network Rail and the government to listen. ""That was a major dereliction of duty by both Network Rail and the government,"" she said. Ms Jones added: ""If [the new owners] try to impose further crippling rent increases at the scale suggested by Network Rail, they can expect organised opposition."" According to the NAO, Network Rail valued the portfolio at Â£1.17bn prior to the sale, but a competitive bidding process meant it fetched more. It said the track operator also sold the property on a leasehold basis, so it could continue to safely maintain the UK's railway infrastructure. Rent hike for railway arch businesses Network Rail sells railway arches for Â£1.5bn But the NAO also said that Network Rail had ""not explicitly"" considered issues such as tenant protection or community regeneration during the sale. And while the new owners - Blackstone Group and Telereal Trillium - have adopted a charter to guide their dealings with tenants, it has no legal basis. Amyas Morse, head of the NAO, said: ""Network Rail achieved value for money in terms of the price paid... However, it is concerning that tenants as stakeholders did not form part of the aims of the sale and that they were only fully considered late in the process."" Blackstone and Telereal have taken on Network Rail's existing lease agreements, meaning tenants' contractual obligations are unchanged. But National Rail has always set rents based on market conditions and the new owners plan to continue this practice. Prior to the sale, Network Rail suggested buyers could expect a 54% rise in rent over the next three to four years. Ms Jones said this was what arches tenants ""feared the most"". ""We are the backbone of our communities, driving local economic development and bringing variety and vitality to urban neighbourhoods all over the country. Big rent increases will kill that vitality stone dead."" David Biggs, managing director at Network Rail Property, said: ""Our role is to safely run, improve and grow the railway for everyone that relies on it. ""The sale has enabled us to deliver a number of schemes, while at the same time tenants and communities will benefit from investment in the estate by the new owner."" A spokesperson for the Department of Transport said: ""The rights of all tenants have been protected and all current agreements fully honoured. A charter commits the new owner to engage in an open and honest manner with their tenants and the community, as well as work with long-standing small business tenants to resolve financial pressures.""

"The boy was found injured in the Somerford Grove area of Hackney A teenage boy has been stabbed to death in an attack in Hackney, east London. The 15-year-old victim was found injured in Somerford Grove at about 21:00 BST on Wednesday and died shortly after, police said. A shopkeeper said a boy ran into his store pleading for help, saying he had been stabbed in the back. A second boy, aged 16, found nearby Shacklewell Road, was also stabbed but did not sustain life-threatening injuries. A man from Elif Food Centre, who did not want to be named, told BBC London he tried to help one of the victims. He said: ""One boy came running into the shop last night saying 'I have been stabbed in the back. Help me. Help me.' ""We called an ambulance and now police have seized our CCTV."" Two friends of the victim spoke of their shock after visiting the crime scene. One said: ""It came as a surprise to us because he was a good guy. ""We did music together. He didn't only produce afrobeats, he made drill music as well. He also sold some beats to some big artists. ""I never thought that any of my friends would be murdered. I'm shocked."" The other friend added: ""I saw him the day before yesterday. He was a good friend, a nice lad. ""I'm so done. It doesn't feel safe any more."" The 15-year-old boy is one of the youngest victims to be stabbed to death in London so far this year Police said a Section 60 stop-and-search order had been put in place for the whole of Hackney. No arrests have been made in connection with the killing. Met Commissioner Cressida Dick described it as a ""terrible, terrible thing"" as the force revealed statistics showing a drop in homicides compared to the previous financial year. Data compares 2017-18 and 2018-19 financial years 311Fewer knife crime victims under the age of 25 32Fewer homicide victims Speaking about the latest stabbing in Hackney, Ms Dick said the two boys were with a group of other boys and a girl, adding there was ""some sort of confrontation with another group"". Leigh Milner, BBC News Another boy, aged 16, was found stabbed near the crime scene Just off a busy main road there is a huge cordon surrounding the Somerford Grove estate. Elif Food Centre, a 24-hour off-licence, is also taped off as police officers stand guard. Right in the middle of the cordon a big blue tent can be seen - the spot where the victim died. Residents have been telling me they are shocked and scared as only six days ago another person was stabbed to death in Hackney. Hours later, officers were called to another, unrelated, stabbing near Camden Town Tube station. A man suffered ""life-threatening"" injuries in the attack on Camden Road shortly after midnight. So far this year, more than 40 murder investigations have been launched in the capital by the Metropolitan Police and British Transport Police. Twenty-nine of those cases are stabbing investigations. London mayor Sadiq Khan said he was ""deeply saddened"" by the latest killing. ""This horrific violence has absolutely no place on our streets,"" he said.

"Voters are continuing to head to the polls for council and mayoral elections across England and Northern Ireland. Elections are being held for 248 English councils, six mayors and all 11 councils in Northern Ireland. Polling stations for the votes - spanning metropolitan and district councils and unitary authorities - are open until 22:00 BST. No local elections are taking place in Scotland and Wales. Live coverage as voters go to the polls How the BBC reports polling day What can you not do in a polling station? Which elections are taking place in May? This is the biggest set of local elections in England's four-year electoral cycle, with more than 8,400 seats being contested. A further 462 seats are up for grabs in Northern Ireland.   By-elections can take place in some council wards even if that council is not scheduled for elections this year. Check your council website for details. Voters in 10 local authorities in England need to either show ID or produce their polling card before they can vote as part of a trial scheme. Those in Braintree, Broxtowe, Craven, Derby, North Kesteven, Woking and Pendle have to show ID before they can vote. Voters in Mid Sussex, North West Leicestershire, and Watford local authorities are required to show their polling card. Everyone else in England can vote as usual, with no need to bring along a polling card or any proof of ID. But in Northern Ireland, voters need photo ID, the polling card received through the post being for information purposes only. Results for about 108 English councils are expected to be declared before 06:00 on Friday. The remaining 140 are scheduled to come in throughout Friday, mostly between midday and 1800 BST. The Northern Irish results will take longer to come through because of a more complicated voting system.

"Grassfires spread quickly, especially during the dry summer months Arsonists were responsible for a 75% spike in grassfires in the past year, new figures have shown. A total of 2,850 fires were started from April 2018 to March 2019, compared with 1,627 in the 12 months previously. Fire chiefs said these figures were ""very disappointing"", and attributed it tolast year's hot and dry summer. Wales' fire services have developed an educational programme in a bid to tackle the problem, resulting in 60,000 speeches to schoolchildren. Kelvin Griffiths, 65, a farmer from Carmel, Gwynedd, lost grazing land in a grassfire on Cilgwyn Mountain last year, which shares common land on Ywch Gwyrfai. ""There was a huge fire stretching for a mile long. I have cattle and sheep that graze there,"" he said. ""There are houses on the common nearby who were really worried."" Why are there wildfires in February? Animals caught in wildfires Lisa Jones - who lives nearby - took this picture of the fire in Carmel Operation Dawns Glaw,externalwas set up in 2016 to tackle deliberate grassfires, involving all three of Wales' fire services. The UK heatwave of 2018 - one of the driest and warmest summers in Wales since 1995 - also meant more fires. The operation's chairman Mydrian Harries said: ""Sadly in the last year we've seen that increase and predominantly attributed it to the hot weather in June, July and August. ""When the weather starts drying, any fire that commences does spread rapidly. ""Add to that some warm currents and prevailing winds and we do find the fire spreads rapidly. Unfortunately there's a sector out there who do see this as opportunities to burn."" Mr Harries said about 50% of all last year's grassfires were recorded as deliberate. ""While these statistics are very disappointing, they should not take away from the overall success of Operation Dawns Glaw,"" he said. Fire officers are also looking to tackle fly-tipping and countryside rubbish fires, which can spread to grassland, starting huge fires. Natural Resources Wales says land can take ""decades"" to recover from severe grassfires Land owners and farmers are allowed to do controlled burns on their land between October and March, but only if they have created a specific plan for starting and containing the fire. Anyone carrying out one of these burns outside of these months or without a plan is committing arson. However, Mr Griffiths believes thesestrict regulations,externalmean farmers' land becomes overgrown, making it more at risk of spreading grassfires. ""Now there are so many restrictions on burning, if you want to burn, you have to inform the police, create fire barriers and have an army of people,"" he said. ""It's not feasible. It overgrows and then it becomes a threat and cattle and sheep can't access the grazing. ""Once you ignite it just goes 'whoosh' and if there's a strong wind behind, it takes no time at all."" Mid and West Wales Fire and Rescue Service said it was not its legislation to police. A spokesman said: ""What we're doing with the Welsh government and partners in Dawns Glaw is to tell people to burn within the prescribed periods."" The Welsh Government said it was ""irresponsible"" to set a fire in open land ""without proper controls and safeguards, or outside the permitted season"". ""Such fires can very easily spread out of control, for example if the wind strengthens or changes direction, and can take days or even weeks to extinguish, especially if they spread into peat,"" a spokesman said. ""This in turn ties up fire crews who might well be needed to attend other incidents. The regulations are designed to greatly reduce these risks.""

"Protesters at a ""die in"" in Glasgow The UK should lead the global fight against climate change by cutting greenhouse gases to nearly zero by 2050, a report says. The Committee on Climate Change (CCC) maintains this can be done at no added cost from previous estimates. Its report says that if other countries follow the UK, thereâs a 50-50 chance of staying below the recommended 1.5C temperature rise by 2100. A 1.5C rise is considered the threshold for dangerous climate change. Some say the proposed 2050 target for near-zero emissions is too soft, but others will fear the goal could damage the UK's economy. The CCC - the independent adviser to government on climate change - said it would not be able to hit ânet zeroâ emissions any sooner, but 2050 was still an extremely significant goal. The main author Chris Stark told me: âThis report would have been absolutely inconceivable just a few years ago. People would have laughed us out of court for suggesting that the target could be so high.â The main change, he said, was the huge drop in the cost of renewable energy prompted by government policies to nurture solar and wind power. Climate change: Where we are in seven charts Will the government pay you to go green? What do all the climate change terms mean? What is climate change? He said the BBC's David Attenborough climate documentary,protests by Extinction Rebellionand speeches by theteenage campaigner Greta Thunberghad persuaded the public that the problem needed urgent action. But Mr Stark said there was no way the 2050 target would be achieved unless the government backed it with policies and money. He noted that the UK was already slipping away from a legal obligation to cut its emissions step-by-step between now and 2032. This video can not be played Teen activist Greta Thunberg addresses Extinction Rebellion rally The cost of the new proposal, the CCC estimates, is tens of billions of pounds a year and may reach to 1-2% of national wealth (as measured by GDP) each year by 2050. That doesnât count the benefits of decarbonisation - such as cleaner air and water. The CCC said England can eliminate emissions by 2050, whileScotland could go carbon-free sooner - by 2045. Scotland has exceptional potential for planting trees (which absorb carbon dioxide) and is more suited for carbon capture and storage. Wales can only cut 95% of its emissions by 2050because of its farm industry.Northern Ireland will follow Englandâs targets. The government is studying the report, which has substantial implications for public finances, and says it ""sets us on a path to become the first major economy to legislate to end our contribution to global warming entirely"". The plan is for ânet zeroâ emissions by 2050, which means balancing carbon emissions with carbon removal. In practice, we'll need to slash the amount of CO2 we put in the atmosphere. Unavoidable emissions need to be captured and stored (for example, where CO2 is collected from a power station chimney and put underground) or offset by planting trees. Until now, the target had been to reduce emissions by 80% compared with 1990 levels by 2050. The CCC believes that achieving zero emissions depends on low-carbon technologies and changes to industry, and public behaviour. Here are some of the report's recommendations for the public. Home heating The report has one controversial recommendation: to turn down the home thermostat to 19C in winter. We will need to insulate our homes much better. Some of us will use heat pumps - a sort of reverse refrigeration technology that sucks warmth from the ground - and convert natural gas boilers to hydrogen ones. The committee expects consumer bills to rise at first, then fall as a newer, cheaper electricity generators are introduced. Flying The aviation industry is trying to bring down the cost of making jet fuels from waste materials. But the CCC says this wonât be enough. The number of flights we take is increasing, and the report predicts that government action will be needed to constrain the growth. However, it doesnât say how â and the committee chair, John Gummer, ducked a question about Heathrow expansion at the report's launch. Cars The report says we won't need to overhaul our motoring habits, but eventually we will be driving electric cars. The government has set a target date of 2040 beyond which conventional car sales will be banned. However,the committee says that deadline should be 2030. Meat The committee notes many people are already eating less red meat for the health of the planet and themselves. It says people can reduce their diet-related emissions by 35% if they transition from a high-meat diet to a low-meat one. But it only predicts a 20% drop in meat consumption by 2050. Waste Bio-degradable waste should not be sent to landfill after 2025. This means we would all be obliged to separate our food waste from other rubbish. The report recommends reducing food waste as far as possible. This video can not be played Strangers are sharing unwanted food in a bid to save money and reduce food waste. The CCC says people can also take the following steps: Choosing to walk, cycle or take public transport Choosing LED light-bulbs and electric appliances with high energy efficiency ratings Setting the water temperature in their heating systems to no higher than 55C Using only peat-free compost Choosing quality products that last longer and sharing rather than buying items, like power tools, that are used infrequently Checking your pension funds and ISAs to see if your investments support low-carbon industries The big push is to decarbonise industry and heat generation. Carbon capture technology will be needed on many of the major emitters: the steel, paper, aluminium and paper industries. Farmers would need to find ways to reduce methane emissions from cows Agriculture is a major emitter of greenhouse gases through sheep and cattle burping methane, and from fertilisers. Farmers would need to reduce the amount of land in pasture, increase woodland, and feed cattle food that creates less methane gas. The fracking industry would also be affected - the committee says we should only use fracked gas in the UK if it replaces gas that would otherwise be imported. Climate change food calculator: What's your diet's carbon footprint? What is a climate emergency? How can I help? Environmental groups are supportive - although many think 2050 is too conservative. The UK Health Alliance on Climate Change has called on the government to adopt the recommendations but ""adopt a net-zero target before 2050"". Lorna Greenwood of Extinction Rebellion told me: ""2050 condemns us to a bleak future... Others are already dying round the world thanks to inaction and far-off target setting."" The environmental campaign group WWF has said: âThe problem is, weâve been acting as if we have time. But if we want a world with coral reefs, safe coastal cities and enough food for everyone, we must act now."" Business and industry groups have expressed support but argue they need government help. Rain Newton-Smith, chief economist at the Confederation of British Industry (CBI) said: âThe UK should do all it can to mitigate the worst impacts of climate change.

"This video can not be played Tear gas and water cannon hit Venezuela protesters Venezuelan opposition supporters have been holding mass protests, a day after violent clashes with government forces. ""We will keep going with more strength than ever,"" opposition leader Juan GuaidÃ³ tweeted. Pro-government rallies are also taking place. The rival demonstrations come after President NicolÃ¡s Maduro said he had stopped an ""attempted coup"" on Tuesday. Mr GuaidÃ³ says he is backed by members of the armed forces, but Mr Maduro insists he still has their support. In a fiery television address on Tuesday,Mr Maduro accused protesters of ""serious crimes""which he said would ""not go unpunished"", and said the US was plotting against him. Venezuela crisis in 300 words Who is Juan GuaidÃ³? Profile: NicolÃ¡s Maduro Mr GuaidÃ³ declared himself Venezuela's interim leader in January and has been recognised by more than 50 countries, including the US, the UK and most in Latin America. But Mr Maduro - backed by Russia, China and the top of the country's military - has refused to cede leadership to his rival. US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said military action was ""possible"" if necessary but that the US would prefer a peaceful transition of power. Russia's Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov warned the US against further ""aggressive"" steps. The UN meanwhile called on both sides to exercise ""maximum restraint"". Mr GuaidÃ³ addressed his supporters in Caracas on Wednesday Addressing his supporters in Caracas, Mr GuaidÃ³ called the protests an ""irreversible process"" and vowed to continue demonstrations every day ""to achieve freedom"". ""We are on the right track, there is no turning back,"" he said. He also said there would be a series of staggered strikes starting on Thursday and culminating in a general strike. Local media report gunfire in Altamira, a neighbourhood in east Caracas where the opposition regularly gathers. There were also clashes on a highway close to an airbase in the east of the capital, with protesters driving a van through the perimeter fence. National Guard on motorbikes fired tear gas at the demonstrators. Some demonstrators threw stones, while others have been seen making Molotov cocktails. Demonstrations have taken place in all 23 states of Venezuela as well as in Caracas, NGOs and local media say. There were also pro-government protests in Venezuela The UN Human Rights Office has said it is ""extremely worried"" by reports,externalof security forces using ""excessive"" force against demonstrators. ""We call on all sides to show maximum restraint and on the authorities to respect the right to peaceful assembly,"" spokesperson Marta Hurtado said. But there were also pro-government demonstrations, with President Maduro saying workers were gathering across the country to celebrate May Day. By Guillermo Olmo, BBC Venezuela correspondent Juan GuaidÃ³ had appeared to be losing momentum but it seems that Tuesday's events have revived his bid. The La Carlota airbase, where the violent clashes took place yesterday, looks like a war zone. It was covered with broken glass and pieces of brick and stone, as well as bullet cases and gas canisters. There were burnt motorbikes and a burned-out bus blocking the street. In the west side of the city there was a pro-government demonstration. Despite very few attendants at the last rallies called by the government, this one on Wednesday seemed to be full of their supporters. May Day has always been a very significant date for the leftist Venezuelan government - it is something they have traditionally marked. The pro-government march was peaceful; there was a party atmosphere there, with music and dancing. From there we went to a square in Altamira, an opposition stronghold. It was also full of people, peaceful protesters so far - although there are reports coming through of shots fired somewhere in the city. There were more attendants than in the last protests called by Mr GuaidÃ³. But the rest of the city was completely calm. We've seen people walking dogs and buying fruit. Some said they could not go to work on Tuesday because their employers told them not to go, but their areas have remained peaceful. Mr GuaidÃ³ posted a video showing him with a number of men in military uniform. He said he had the support of ""brave soldiers"" in Caracas. He urged Venezuelans to join them in the streets, and appeared alongside another opposition leader, Leopoldo LÃ³pez, who has been under house arrest since 2014. Supporters on both sides then gathered around Caracas throughout the day, and there were clashes between Mr GuaidÃ³'s supporters and armed military vehicles. This video can not be played Military vehicles were filmed driving into demonstrators on Tuesday Spain's government later confirmed that Mr LÃ³pez and his family had sought safety in their embassy, but said the opposition figure has not claimed political asylum. Chilean foreign minister Roberto Ampuero confirmed on Twitter he had initially come to their embassy but later transferred to Spain's. Is there a new cult of personality in Venezuela? 'Like living in the apocalypse' The bridge of desperation Mr GuaidÃ³, the president of the opposition-controlled National Assembly, has called on Venezuela's military to back him, saying President Maduro is a ""usurper"" because he was re-elected in polls that had been widely disputed. Mr GuaidÃ³, pictured here standing on the car, has declared himself the interim president UN Secretary General AntÃ³nio Guterres has appealed for both sides to avoid violence, whilethe EU has called for ""utmost restraint to avoid the loss of lives and an escalation in tensions"",external. The US has reiterated its support for Mr GuaidÃ³. Meanwhile, National Security Adviser John Bolton has accused Russia and Cuba of interfering in Venezuelan politics, claiming Mr Maduro was planning to flee to Cuba but was persuaded to stay by Moscow. But both Russia and Mr Maduro rejected the claim, with a Russian foreign ministry spokesperson accusing the US of conducting an ""information war"". Mr Lavrov spoke to Mr Pompeo on the phone on Wednesday, warning him of grave consequences if the US took further ""aggressive"" steps in Venezuela, saying US ""interference"" in the country broke international law. This video can not be played Why Venezuela matters to the US... and vice versa Governments who still back Mr Maduro - including Bolivia and Cuba - condemned Mr GuaidÃ³'s efforts as an attempted ""coup d'etat"". The Mexican government expressed ""concern about a possible increase in violence"" while Colombian President Ivan Duque urged the Venezuelan military to stand ""on the right side of history"" against Mr Maduro.

"This video can not be played On Tuesday, before he was sacked by Theresa May, Gavin Williamson said in a BBC interview that he had never leaked anything from the NSC Gavin Williamson has been sacked as defence secretary following an inquiry into a leak from a top-level National Security Council meeting. Downing Street said the PM had ""lost confidence in his ability to serve"" and Penny Mordaunt will take on the role. The inquiry followed reports over a plan to allow Huawei limited access to help build the UK's new 5G network. Mr Williamson, who has been defence secretary since 2017, ""strenuously"" denies leaking the information. In a meeting with Mr Williamson on Wednesday evening, Theresa May told him she had information that provided ""compelling evidence"" that he was responsible for the unauthorised disclosure. In a letter confirming his dismissal, she said: ""No other, credible version of events to explain this leak has been identified."" Responding in a letter to the PM, Mr Williamson said he was ""confident"" that a ""thorough and formal inquiry"" would have ""vindicated"" his position. ""I appreciate you offering me the option to resign, but to resign would have been to accept that I, my civil servants, my military advisers or my staff were responsible: this was not the case,"" he said. As it happened: Reaction after Williamson sacking Exchange of letters between May and Williamson Profile: Gavin Williamson Kuenssberg: Now Williamson told to 'go away and shut up' The inquiry into the National Security Council leak began after the Daily Telegraph reported on the Huawei decision and subsequent warnings within cabinet about possible risks to national security over a deal with Huawei. BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg said sources close to the former defence secretary had told her Mr Williamson did meet the Daily Telegraph's deputy political editor, Steven Swinford, but, she pointed out ""that absolutely does not prove"" he leaked the story to him. According toSky News defence and security correspondent Alistair Bunkall,external, Mr Williamson swore on his children's lives that he was not responsible for the leak. Security correspondent Frank Gardner said the BBC had been told ""more than one concerning issue"" had been uncovered regarding Mr Williamson during the leak inquiry and not just the Huawei conversation. Downing Street has made a very serious accusation and is sure enough to carry out this sacking. For the prime minister's allies, it will show that she is, despite the political turmoil, still strong enough to move some of her ministers around - to hire and fire. Mr Williamson is strenuously still denying that the leak was anything to do with him at all. There is nothing fond, or anything conciliatory, in either the letter from the prime minister to him, or his reply back to her. Read more from Laura The National Security Council (NSC) is made up of senior cabinet ministers and its weekly meetings are chaired by the prime minister, with other ministers, officials and senior figures from the armed forces and intelligence agencies invited when needed. It is a forum where secret intelligence can be shared by GCHQ, MI6 and MI5 with ministers, all of whom have signed the Official Secrets Act. There has been no formal confirmation of Huawei's role in the 5G network and No 10 said a final decision would be made at the end of spring. Penny Mordaunt: UK's first female defence secretary Huawei: The story of a controversial company Inquiry to be held into Huawei leak Huawei has denied there is any risk of spying or sabotage, or that it is controlled by the Chinese government. Mrs May said the leak from the meeting on 23 April was ""an extremely serious matter and a deeply disappointing one"". It is vital for the operation of good government and for the UK's national interest in some of the most sensitive and important areas that the members of the NSC - from our armed forces, our security and intelligence agencies, and the most senior level of government - are able to have frank and detailed discussions in full confidence that the advice and analysis provided is not discussed or divulged beyond that trusted environment. ""That is why I commissioned the cabinet secretary to establish an investigation into the unprecedented leak from the NSC meeting last week, and why I expected everyone connected to it - ministers and officials alike - to comply with it fully. You undertook to do so. ""I am therefore concerned by the manner in which you have engaged with this investigation."" Read the rest of the letter in full Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt said the prime minister had no alternative but to sack Mr Williamson, but he said on a personal level he was ""very sorry about what happened"". When asked whether there should be a criminal inquiry into the NSC leak, new defence secretary Ms Mordaunt said: ""The prime minister has made her decision. ""What I'm focused on is getting on with the job."" Labour's deputy leader Tom Watson has called for a police inquiry to investigate whether or not Mr Williamson breached the Official Secrets Act. That sentiment was echoed by former national security adviser Lord Ricketts. He told BBC Newsnight that on the face of it, the leak was a breach of the official secrets act and therefore the police ought to be considering an inquiry. Lib Dems leader Vince Cable said Mr Williamson's sacking was ""absolutely extraordinary"" and the PM did it in ""such a forthright way"". He added that he believed it was ""clearly a police matter"". His deputy, Jo Swinson, has asked the police to open an investigation. But Scotland Yard said in a statement that it was a matter for the National Security Council and the Cabinet Office, and it was not carrying out an investigation. Defence Committee chairman Julian Lewis told the BBC that Mr Williamson's sacking was a ""loss"" when looked at ""purely"" from the point of view of defence. He said he thought ""very highly"" of Ms Mordaunt - the first woman to take the role of defence secretary. Rory Stewart has been confirmed as the new international development secretary, taking over from Ms Mordaunt. Mr Stewart said he believed the prime minister and national security adviser had ""made the right decision"" in sacking Mr Williamson.

"Gavin Williamson has strenuously denied he leaked information from the National Security Council as calls are being made for a police inquiry. He was sacked as defence secretary for allegedly disclosing plans to allow Chinese telecoms giant Huawei to help build the UK's 5G network. Opposition MPs said there should be an investigation into whether the Official Secrets Act had been breached. David Lidington, the PM's de facto deputy, said the matter was closed. Responding to questions from MPs in the Commons, he said it was not considered necessary to refer it to the police, but ministers would ""co-operate fully should the police themselves consider an investigation necessary"". Mr Lidington told MPs that Mr Williamson had not been accused of any criminal offence, but had lost the confidence of the prime minister. Mr Williamson isquoted in several of Thursday's newspapersas saying he was the victim of a ""vendetta"" and a ""kangaroo court"". He told Sky News thathe ""swore on his children's lives"",externalthat he was not responsible for the leak. Reaction to Williamson's sacking Exchange of letters between May and Williamson Profile: Gavin Williamson Kuenssberg: Now Williamson told to 'go away and shut up' He also cited poor relations with Sir Mark Sedwill, the Cabinet Secretary and National Security Adviser, who carried out the leak investigation,telling the Times,externalhe would have had been ""absolutely exonerated"" had police probed what went on after the NSC meeting. The inquiry into the leak began after the Daily Telegraph reported on the council's confidential discussions - including warnings from several cabinet members about possible risks to national security over a deal with Huawei. At a meeting with Mr Williamson on Wednesday evening, Theresa May told him she had information that suggested that he was responsible for the unauthorised disclosure.

Brexitcast becomes leakcast: My way or the Huawei Penny Mordaunt: UK's first female defence secretary Huawei: The story of a controversial company Labour deputy leader Tom Watson told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that Mr Williamson has ""a right to clear his name"" and the best way to do that is through a criminal inquiry. He said: ""This is about the law applying equally to everyone. We have had very high profile civil servants going to jail for breaching the Official Secrets Act."" Disclosure of official information relating to security and intelligence by a ""Crown servant"" - including government ministers - can be illegal. For it to be an offence the disclosure has to be damaging and done without lawful authority (ie not as part of the person's official duties). Being found guilty of this carries a sentence ranging from a fine to two years in prison. If the police were to launch an investigation, the Attorney General Geoffrey Cox would decide whether there was to be a prosecution. Former national security adviser Lord Ricketts, a crossbench peer, told the BBC's Newsnight programme that on the face of it, the leak was a breach of the act and police ought to be considering an inquiry. The Liberal Democrats said its deputy leader Jo Swinson has written to the Metropolitan Police Commissioner calling for a criminal investigation ""to ascertain whether the actions of Mr Williamson constitute a breach"". Scotland Yard said in a statement that it was a matter for the National Security Council and the Cabinet Office, and it was not carrying out an investigation. ""Clearly, if at any stage we receive any information that would suggest criminal offences have been committed, then we will look into that,"" it added.

Penny Mordaunt is taking over as defence secretary Penny Mordaunt has taken over as defence secretary - the first woman in the role - and prisons minister Rory Stewart is replacing her as international development secretary. By BBC security correspondent Gordon Corera Sources maintain damage has been done by the leak. It was not of the most sensitive possible information. That would be details of intelligence sources and methods. A leak in Washington a few years ago pointed to the fact that there was an agent inside a group planning attacks on the West from Yemen. That put the agent's life at risk and compromised a valuable stream of intelligence. The Huawei leak related to a policy decision. But the damage lies in relations with allies. The US has been campaigning hard for Huawei to be excluded from new 5G networks. The leak may not have fully captured the restrictions to be placed on the company even though its role was approved. And because the decision was leaked within hours of the meeting ending, there was no chance to explain the decision to Washington. The day the leak appeared, a senior official from America's National Security Agency spy agency spoke to me to reiterate Washington's concerns and days later a State Department official told me that the US would have to re-evaluate information sharing with allies that used Huawei. That official also came to London to continue the push. And so the frustration from UK officials is that their ability to explain the policy to the public and to allies was compromised by the speed and substance of what was revealed.

"As a relatively new defence secretary, Gavin Williamson once said that Russia should ""go away and shut up"". Well, the prime minister has told him to go away because in her view, he did not shut up. In a leak investigation, that has broken the precedent of most leak investigations that end up with precisely no result at all, a rapid hunt of just a few days has resulted in the sacking of one of the most senior ministers in government, and one of the few ministers frankly, that the prime minister could more or less rely on. Mr Williamson was for a while chief whip too, the keeper of the government's secrets. And, crucially, one of the few ministers who had good relations with the DUP. Indeed, brokering a deal on Theresa May's behalf in the wreckage of the 2017 general election. But there was also a lot of resentment and frustration in government circles at how he sometimes behaved, suspicion often that he was too quick to seek his own political advantage, too interested in his own future, too entertained by the dark arts of Westminster. That meant that as soon as the Huawei story broke, fingers were being privately pointed to him as the source of the leak. ""Operation get Gav"", as one of his allies described it. Gavin Williamson sacked over Huawei leak Ministers were quick to write to Number 10 demanding a full inquiry, some of them privately fuming that ""it must have been Williamson"". Number 10 now says there was ""compelling evidence"" to prove that it was him. Officials carrying out the inquiry did look at his phone. He did, by his own admission, have a conversation on the particular day with the journalist who broke the story. Downing Street has made a very serious accusation and is sure enough to carry out this sacking. For the prime minister's allies, it will show that she is, despite the political turmoil, still strong enough to move some of her ministers around - to hire and fire. Mr Williamson is strenuously still denying that the leak was anything to do with him at all. There is nothing fond, or anything conciliatory, in either the letter from the prime minister to him, or his reply back to her. Exchange of letters between May and Williamson Profile: Gavin Williamson And having had a fractious relationship with the National Security Adviser and Cabinet Secretary, Sir Mark Sedwill, some of Mr Williamson's friends believe that those looking into the affair were simply too quick to conclude the former defence secretary was responsible, treating him differently in this short investigation, compared to others who were on the list. One senior Conservative also points out a rich irony here, saying: ""A government that governs by open leaking then sacks someone for not being open about their leaking. We have surely moved from the incompetent to the theatre of the absurd!"" These are strange times indeed.
