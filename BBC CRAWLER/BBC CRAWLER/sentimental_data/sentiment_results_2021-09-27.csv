"Covid vaccinations are available to 12 to 15-year-olds across the UK School leaders have warned about being targeted by hoax Covid vaccine consent letters, which aim to spread anti-vaccine messages to parents in England. Head teachers have been sent a ""consent checklist"", under a fake NHS logo, along with a letter telling them to share this with parents. But the checklist includes a series of negative claims about the risks of vaccinations to young people. Head teachers' leaders say the hoax letters are ""massively unhelpful"". ""We would appeal for those behind these fake consent forms to stop circulating them,"" said Julie McCulloch of the ASCL head teachers' union. The letters sent to schools are presented as being a consent form with information to be sent to parents ahead of pupils being given Covid vaccinations. Pupils begin receiving Covid vaccine Schools face threats over Covid vaccine Why children are being given Covid vaccines International comparisons on vaccinating children Below an ""NHS Vaccines"" logo, it includes claims such as the vaccine being a risk for ""strokes, blindness, deafness, clotting, miscarriages, anaphylaxis and cardiovascular disorders"". It appears from social media that some parents have already been sent the letter, after schools had been tricked into sharing them. ""Today we have a 'consent checklist' which seems almost kinda like it's designed to put kids off?,"" said one parent on Twitter - with a follow-up that the school had been in touch again to withdraw the letter. Dr Jonathan Leach, NHS England medical director for Covid immunisation, told confused parents on Twitter that this was ""not a legitimate NHS form"". Heads' leader Ms McCulloch said the hoax letters were causing problems for schools when they were already under pressure. ""One of these pressures is the fact that a large number of pupils have caught Covid and are absent from school - the very thing that the vaccination programme is designed to address,"" she said. Covid vaccinations have been offered to 12 to 15-year-olds across the UK this term, with the aim of reducing the spread of the virus and the resulting disruption in schools. Among those schools sent the hoax letter were those in the St John the Baptist academy trust in East Anglia. ""Our schools are doing an amazing job to continue their primary purpose of education and to keep children and staff safe. And it is shocking that we are being targeted by hoaxers, who are trying to undermine those efforts by pretending they are from the NHS,"" said Brian Conway, chief executive of the trust. He said that Covid cases were rising among the younger years in secondary school, but there were few cases in the top years, ""where many students have already had the jab"". Any unauthorised use of the NHS logo was taken very seriously, said a spokeswoman for the Department of Health and Social Care. ""Misinformation about the vaccine is dangerous and costs lives. We are continuing to do everything we can, working with local authorities and our NHS, to counter the spread of untruths with public information that is grounded in science and facts,"" said the DHSC spokeswoman.

"Here are five things you need to know about the coronavirus pandemic this Monday evening. We'll have another update for you tomorrow. Boris Johnson will host a campaign group representing families bereaved by Covidat a private reception in Downing Street on Tuesday. The prime minister declined to meet the group, called Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice, last year - citing a threat of legal action over an official pandemic inquiry. The government has since said an official probe will begin next spring. The families say they will use the meeting to share stories of how their loved ones died, and repeat their calls for a public inquiry to start now. Wales has partially agreed to align with England's plans to overhaul rules on international travel - green and amber lists of countrieswill be merged and pre-departure Covid tests will be scrappedfrom 4 October. But no decision has been made yet about removing the requirement for PCR tests for those returning from abroad. The mother of a 31-year-old woman who died from cancer after her chemotherapy was paused due to pandemic Covid measures has spoken publicly for the first time, saying she's ""broken"" by her daughter's death. Kelly Smith from Macclesfield died from bowel cancer in June 2020. Her parents have started a petition calling for an end to cancer treatment delays. Research by the Institute for Public Policy Research has now estimated it could take more than a decade to clear the cancer treatment backlog in England. This video can not be played Mandy Russell says she's ""broken"" after losing her daughter to cancer after the pandemic paused her chemotherapy The town with England's highest rate of Covid infectionshas seen its figure nearly double within a week. Kettering, in Northamptonshire, saw 900 cases per 100,000 people in the week to 22 September. The number rose sharply among secondary school pupils, which officials say accounts for most of the cases. The county's joint director of public health Lucy Wightman urged people to ""continue to play their part in preventing further spread"". Movement restrictions in New South Wales - including its capital Sydney - are going to be lifted gradually from 11 October, when the vaccination rate is set to hit 70%, the NSW state premier has announced. The measures will continue to be eased as levels hit 80% and then 90%, which is expected to be on 1 December. But those who have not been fully vaccinated won't be able to do things such as take part in community sports, eat out at restaurants and go out shopping until that final date. State premier Gladys Berejiklian says: ""The message is if you want to be able to have a meal with friends and welcome people in your home, you have to get vaccinated.""

"Britain First leader Paul Golding at a protest in 2017 The far-right group Britain First has registered as a political party after its application was approved by the Electoral Commission. Party leader Paul Golding said he was ""ecstatic"" and would start ""building the electoral arm of our party"". The party was deregistered in 2017 after it failed to renew its registration on time. An Electoral Commission spokesperson said the party's application had ""met the legal criteria"". The watchdog assesses potential new parties to ensure they comply with legal obligations and that their proposed names, descriptions and emblems do not risk misleading or confusing voters. Parties also need to show that their constitutions or membership policies do not breach equalities law. The Electoral Commission does not consider a group's political views when deciding whether or not to register a party. Britain First fined by elections watchdog Facebook bans Britain First pages Why is Britain First big online? Britain First campaigns on an anti-immigration message and has called for a halt to all further immigration except in specific cases. The group has developed a strong online following, attracting attention when one of its anti-Islamic videos was retweeted by the then-US President Donald Trump. However it has performed less well electorally, with Mr Golding securing only 1.2% of the vote when he stood in the 2016 London mayoral election. In 2018, Facebook removed the group's pages saying it had repeatedly violated its community standards. The decision came shortly after Mr Golding and the party's deputy leader Jayda Fransen were found guilty of religiously aggravated harassment. In 2019, the group was fined Â£44,200 by the Electoral Commission for ""multiple breaches"" of electoral law, including a failure to keep accurate financial records or donation reports.

"This video can not be played Dilys Hughes says the service station had to close to make sure local people were not hit by the rush NHS patients could be affected if nurses and other medical staff are unable to get fuel, a union has warned. Some nurses had faced aggression when trying to identify themselves as key workers at stations, said Diane Powles, of the Royal College of Nursing (RCN). She called for key workers to be given priority over fuel, and urged people to act responsibly. A Petrol Retailers Association (PRA) poll showed half of its UK stations ""were dry"" over the weekend. The UK environment secretary has saidpeople buying fuel when they do not need it are the cause of queues at petrol stations and empty pumps. Nurses and other medical key workers need priority status for fuel, says Diane Powles, from the Royal College of Nursing Wales Ms Powles, associate director for nursing policy and practise at RCN Wales, said clinical staff have had to prioritise care, and it would have affected people trying to get to work in the hospitals. But she said it would have a greater impact on staff working in the communities such as district nurses, health visitors and midwives. She said: ""We have had some stories of nurses having difficulties to access fuel, and that there has been a lot of altercations at the petrol pump as they try to identify themselves as key workers. ""If this continues into the next few days, it will start to have an impact on patient care - getting to work will prove more challenging for community nurses, midwives and for home visits. ""During the pandemic, key workers were given priority status for shopping and ideally they should have this for petrol stations to allow them to be prioritised. ""The public need to have a think: Do you really need to make that journey because that could stop somebody getting a nurse?"" Several petrol stations shut amid panic buying The pilot helping plug the lorry driver shortage No need for chaos at fuel stations, says boss The UK government has announced it plans tointroduce temporary work visas for foreign lorry driversto ease problems. It is alsosuspending competition lawto allow oil companies to work together to get fuel to forecourts. Oil 4 Wales director, Colin Owens, said its garage in Maesteg usually sells between 20,000 and 30,000 litres of fuel, but in the last 24 hours alone, has gone through 100,000. He described the queues as ""carnage"" and said suppliers are working ""flat out"" after people have been panic buying fuel ""all night"". Mr Owens said the company's oil supplier has ""never let us down"" and ""our tanks are full"", adding: ""I promise you the garages will balance out again and everyone will be served."" Rock band The Charlatans asked on Twitter where they could find fuel in Cardiff Tim Burgess of rock band The Charlatans asked his 255,000 Twitter followers where his band could find fuel in Cardiff to allow them to continue touring. He has since tweeted that they had found enough fuel to continue on to Nottingham after Monday night's gig in the Welsh capital. Allow Twitter content?

One dad from Swansea said the shortage was affecting his children's education. Adam told BBC Radio Wales: ""We'd lost the credit card last week, by the time the new one come through at the weekend the panic buying had hit. ""We had no fuel in the car and we actually had to get out of the car and walk home. So that means the kids haven't gone to school. ""We live near Ammanford and my children's school is up in Pontardawe (10.6 miles or 17 km), so it is a commute in itself, you know. ""If someone has fuel in their tank then they should go home. If they haven't got any at all then of course they're gonna need to queue and they're there for their own reasons, but just be respectful of other people."" Several supermarkets closed petrol stations in Wales due to demand for fuel over the weekend A petrol station in Gwynedd said it had received calls from people in Birmingham, more than 90 miles away, asking if it had any petrol. The Mallwyd service station had so many calls from far away that it closed on Sunday to preserve fuel supplies for locals. Dilys Hughes, who works at the station, said it had been ""manic"" on Friday, with motorists coming from ""everywhere"". She said she was just about to run out of petrol, but there would be no problem if drivers bought fuel as they normally would. She added: ""I might, the way I'm feeling, close today as well."" How serious is the HGV driver shortage? Very little benefit to HGV visa plan, haulier says Andrew Johnson, who runs Dafarn Newydd Store and fuel station in the village of Llanwyddyn, in Powys, has had to ration fuel to just Â£10 per customer. ""We've probably done as much fuel over the weekend as we have over the last five days,"" he said. Some people living in rural areas are struggling for fuel, one petrol station owner says He toldBBC Radio Walespeople were calling from up to 24 miles away asking how much fuel the store had left, which he described as ""unheard of"". ""We've only got 2,000 litre tanks, people have arrived and they've all just said 'we'll take what we're given'."" But he now only has enough fuel to last the store a day-and-a-half and, without a delivery, will have to close. Lloyd Kidby, director at S&K Haulage based in Barry, Vale of Glamorgan, said the business had not been affected by fuel shortages at petrol stations because it bought its own fuel in bulk which is delivered to the depot. However, a number of their drivers travel to them from places including the Midlands and Cornwall. He said he was a few drivers short on Monday because those living further than 50 miles away have not been able to put enough petrol in their cars to travel to south Wales to pick up their lorry. Essentially, he said, it was a problem affecting people getting to work in the first place rather than an issue for the lorries. This video can not be played People should carry on buying petrol as normal, the UK government says On Saturday, UK government ministers announced they are looking to issue about 5,000 temporary visas for foreign lorry drivers to help with the lack of fuel and other products. But any changes to immigration rules will be short-term, with a cap on the number of workers allowed to enter the UK. National Farmers Union (NFU) Cymru has written to the prime minister and Wales' secretary of state asking the government to consider getting access to migrant labour. ""If we have got a need in this country and there is an opportunity to fill it by looking to migrant labour from Europe, then I really think we need to drop those barriers,"" said Abi Reader, a farmer in Wenove, Vale of Glamorgan. Abi Reader, also chair of NFU Cymru, says farmers living in less urban areas are starting to get ""a bit tight"" on fuel Minister blames empty fuel pumps on excess buying Hauliers and poultry workers to get temporary visas She said she is concerned staff will not have enough fuel to get to work and make deliveries. ""I'm astonished at how much we do rely on it [fuel], we've got various animals in because they're close to calfing, we need to be able to keep their areas clean - that needs machinery - and we are going to need full tanks of fuel everyday for them. ""This is also a significant month for planting, and a lot of our contractors will be relying on full tanks of food to make sure they can get out to the fields and get next years food crop in, so I'm a little bit tense about it."" Pausing competition law means the government should be able to get more tankers to struggling areas The transport secretary previously told people to carry on as normal but amid panic buying, Steve Coombe, of PRA, which represent nearly 3,000 independent fuelling stations, said it is illegal to take more than 30 litres of fuel in any container. In a straw poll of its members, he said retailers had reported between a 350% and 500% uplift in volume due to panic buying over the weekend. But he said there ""is variance"" throughout the country, with some deliveries being made with ""no issue"" and expects to see improvements by later this week.

"This video can not be played Labourâs shadow chancellor says she would invest in ""good jobs in the green industries of the future"" Labour has promised to spend an extra Â£28bn a year on making the UK economy more ""green"" if it wins power. Shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves said the money would go on offshore wind farms, planting trees and developing batteries. In her speech to Labour's annual conference in Brighton, she also pledged to phase out business rates to help the Covid-damaged High Street. And she said giant tech firms would pay more tax in future. An aide to Ms Reeves told the BBC the Â£28bn would come from government borrowing and the investment should ""have a positive impact"" on the wider economy. Labour backs Starmer over party rules reforms Labour needs policies now, says Burnham Rayner renews attack on Johnson in scum row In her speech, Ms Reeves said: ""I will be a responsible chancellor. I will be Britain's first green chancellor."" She added: ""I will invest in good jobs in the green industries of the future, giga-factories to build batteries for electric vehicles, a thriving hydrogen industry, offshore wind with turbines made in Britain, planting trees and building flood defences, keeping homes warm and getting energy bills down, good new jobs in communities throughout Britain."" Rachel Reeves is the shadow chancellor with something for everyone. For the Labour Party activists crying out for ambitious pledges following a series of lukewarm announcements there was Â£28bn a year of investment to help the UK reach its climate targets. She also went after some of the most potent symbols for party members: private schools and Jeff Bezos, the founder of Amazon (""if you can afford to fly to the moon, you can afford to pay your taxes here on earth!"") For the business community there was a promise to axe business rates and replace the Â£30bn of revenue withâ¦ something. For those who thought it was all a bit too much she unveiled some fiscal rules that could lightly limit her room to spend and borrow, and a new value for money ""hit squad"" that would scrutinise government spending. She has also upped her speech game significantly, introducing a group of keyworkers in the front row to rapturous applause and lowering her voice dramatically to deliver her soundbites. Ms Reeves said the annual Â£28bn investment - which would continue until 2030 - would help ""protect our planet for future generations"". It would include the Â£3bn shadow business secretary Ed Miliband promised to help make the UK steel industry carbon-neutral in his conference speech on Sunday. Labour is expected to make a series of announcements on where the rest of the money would go. Greenpeace UK welcomed the overall spending pledge, with its head of politics, Rebecca Newsom, saying: ""Tackling the climate crisis has to be at the heart of what the Treasury does."" The independent Climate Change Committee estimates the cost of making the UK carbon-neutral will bebetween 1% and 2% of GDP,externaluntil 2050. Based on last year's figures, that would equate to between Â£19.6bn and Â£39.2bn a year. During her half-hour speech, Ms Reeves said a Labour government would freeze business rates in England until 2023 and make rates relief for smaller firms more generous. It would eventually scrap rates completely, she said, replacing them with a new ""modern"" business tax, which the party is yet to define. Labour is also proposing a new tax on commercial property. And it is proposing to increase the digital services tax - paid by search engines and social media firms - from 2% to 12%, when it is replaced by a higher global corporation tax rate agreed as part of aninternational scheme. Ms Reeves told the conference the party would bring in the ""biggest overhaul of business taxation in a generation"", allowing businesses to ""lead the pack, not watch opportunities go elsewhere."" She announced plans to scrap ""hundreds"" of tax breaks and set up an Office of Value for Money, which aides describe as a ""hit squad"" to scrutinise government spending and ensure tax is used wisely. Ms Reeves said a Labour government would tell firms which have received contracts to deal with the Covid pandemic but under-delivered to repay the money given to them by the government. ""We will set up a team to go through every line of every failed contract where value was not delivered, and claw back every penny of taxpayers' money we possibly can,"" she added, ""because that money belongs in our police, it belongs in our schools and it belongs in our NHS."" The policies announced by Ms Reeves were welcomed by the Federation for Small Businesses, whose national chair Mike Cherry said: ""The shadow chancellor is right to propose concrete reform of a business rates tax which disproportionately burdens the small businesses and sole traders at the heart of local communities."" But Conservative Party co-chairman Oliver Dowden said: ""Successive Labour leaders have threatened businesses with tax hikes, higher bills, and more red tape. ""Only the Conservatives can be trusted to support our businesses and help our economy thrive as we build back better.""

"Beautician Aimee Simpson wants to buy her first home in Edinburgh but cannot afford to Aimee Simpson has spent years saving for a one-bedroom flat. She's 28, works as a beautician and has sacrificed a social life to raise Â£30,000 for a deposit. The problem is, Aimee - who still lives with her parents - wants to buy a place near her work in Edinburgh. With the biggest rise in house prices for 14 years, she can find nothing in her price range in a city squeezed by a shortage in affordable homes and rocketing rent costs. ""A lot of the new builds are just too expensive because they're at a premium,"" she said. ""I've looked at more rundown properties that I would do up, but you're up against property developers - with bigger budgets. ""It is a struggle and you just hit walls everywhere you look."" When Aimee left school in May 2011, the average price for a flat in Edinburgh was Â£164,252. Today, it's Â£236,608. ""It's really disheartening,"" she toldBBC Scotland's Disclosure programme. ""I feel like I could work seven days and still not be any better off."" This video can not be played Aimee, from Edinburgh, and Katherine, from Skye, are both facing struggles finding somewhere to stay She thought about applying to the Scottish government's Low-cost Initiative for First Time Buyers (Lift) scheme, which offers financial assistance for a share in the property. But the scheme's cap for one-bedroom properties in Edinburgh is just Â£125,000. Its rules also state the purchase price can't be higher than a property's Home Report valuation - meaning it is unlikely to be used in the city's competitive market. Lift is now the only government-backed assistance for first-time buyers in Scotland. Aimee added: ""I just feel like Edinburgh's my home. I want to be near my family."" Over the last 10 years, the average price of a home Edinburgh increased by Â£100,000 BBC Scotland's Disclosure has been hearing from young people either priced out of home ownership in the city or unable to find affordable rent. As well as the increase in average house prices, Edinburgh has seen steeper rises in rent prices - around 46% - than any other part of Scotland. ""The market just now is absolutely frantic,"" said Gary Middlemass, an Edinburgh estate agent with 40 years' experience. ""There is simply not enough properties coming on. When something does come on the market there tends to be a lot of interest, which pushes up prices."" However, two Scottish government schemes to aid first-time buyers are coming to an end. The Help to Buy scheme, which supported more than 17,000 new build house sales over the last eight years, is closed to new applications and will end in March 2022. Last year, 80% of those accessing the scheme were first-time buyers, more than half of purchases involved two people and the average household income of applicants was Â£42,000. Meanwhile, the First Home Fund, which assisted 9,000 buyers in just over a year, has been closed despite its early success. The Scottish government has said the decision to scrap the schemes is a result of cuts to its financial transaction budget by the UK government. House builders say their cancellation will ""limit the life choices"" of young people hoping to buy a home. ""I've got real concerns about the people in the middle, those who can't get on to the housing market,"" said Nicola Barclay, chief executive of industry body Homes for Scotland. ""They're earning just a little bit too much, so they can't get a social house. And private rent is stopping them from saving up the kind of deposits that they need to then move onto the housing ladder. ""Their choices are just really limited now."" She highlighted that in England the Help to Buy scheme still exists and is targeted at first-time buyers. Another initiative has also been introduced in England called First Homes, which is a form of shared ownership. ""We have nothing equivalent in Scotland now,"" said Ms Barclay. ""I think it is so unfair that a young adult who has chosen to live and work in Scotland, is unable to buy a house whereas if they had exactly the same job in England, they could do."" Estate agents say there are not enough properties coming on to the market at the moment Housing Secretary Shona Robison described first purchase figures as ""very buoyant"" but defended the decision to close both initiatives. ""The evidence was showing us that actually people using that [Help to Buy] scheme could afford to buy their own home,"" she said. ""But with government assistance they were perhaps buying a bigger property and a more expensive property. ""We have a judgement to make with limited resources. We believe the best investment for those resources is to help those who could not afford to buy their own home without government assistance."" In 2007, the Scottish government predicted house price inflation would cause problems for lower income families. Then Deputy First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said 35,000 homes of all types had to be built a year to reset the balance. However, Scotland's house building industry has yet to return to the pre-financial crash levels of 25,000 a year. The rising costs in Edinburgh has also put pressure on the city's social housing stock, with 21,000 applicants currently on the waiting list. In the last decade, more than 8,300 affordable homes have been built in Edinburgh with 2,100 under construction Families find themselves either priced out by rising rent costs, or given notice to leave their homes as landlords looking to sell take advantage of the increase in house prices. ""I'm not going to pretend it is easy for people, "" said housing convenor, councillor Kate Campbell. ""We have 6,000 people who are currently homeless and we don't have a huge supply of social housing, that's why we're building more."" In the last decade, 8,390 affordable homes have been built in the city. Another 2,100 are currently under construction. Meanwhile, the city is also seeing a growth in so-called ""Build to Rent"" properties - private rented flats aimed at those unable to afford a mortgage but unlikely to get into social housing. Across Scotland, nearly 10,000 are in the pipeline, with more than 3,000 in Edinburgh. The Scottish government has pledged to build 110,000 affordable homes - 70% of which will be social rent - before 2032. This video can not be played 'There's six of us in this tiny flat' But some families are still waiting years for a suitable home. Michael Urquhart, his partner Kara, and their four children have been on Edinburgh's social housing list for 10 years. They've had six privately rented homes in that period and have spent time in one of the city's homeless bed-and-breakfasts. They are currently living in a two-bedroom ex-council flat in the Prestonfield area and bid for social housing each week on the city's online EdIndex system, which sees hundreds of applications per property. Michael said: ""I think I'm probably going to be here for at least another couple of years, just because the bidding's not going well. ""I'd rather just keep myself here, until I can get my forever home."" Additional reporting by Katie McEvinney and Craig Williams.

"Theatres have said they are at breaking point because of the 1m social distancing rule Stormont ministers have agreed to end social distancing restrictions for shops, theatres and a number of other indoor settings in Northern Ireland. The executive has asked some sectors to put in place mitigations including proof of double vaccination or a negative lateral flow test. But this will be advice and not legally enforceable. Ministers did not consider social distancing in the hospitality sector during Monday's virtual meeting. Instead, this will be further discussed on 7 October, First Minister Paul Givansaid in a social media post,external. He added that the changes for indoor seated venues, indoor visitor attractions and retail settings will take effect from 18:00 BST on 30 September.That is the date when the UK-wide furlough scheme ends. Social distancing of at least 1m (3ft) has been a legal requirement in many indoor premises in Northern Ireland. However, those who run venues hosting concerts, conferences and theatres in Northern Ireland have said they are at  breaking point because of the rule. While social distancing measures are to be removed, the executive agreed that face coverings will remain a legal requirement in retail settings and for indoor attractions. They also called for people ""to utilise all other available mitigations such as hand sanitising, good ventilation, and using one-way systems where possible"". Hospitality businesses like pubs and cafes have to serve fewer customers because of social distancing rules BBC News NI's Political Editor Enda McClafferty said it is understood venues will be under no legal obligations to put mitigation measures in place, rather, this will be on an ""opt-in"" basis. On proof of Covid status for entry, he said: ""Venues have been asked to put in place a number of mitigations including proof of being fully vaccinated, proof of a negative lateral flow test or proof of natural immunity through a positive Covid PCR test within the previous six months."" Business groups have previously asked for the law to be relaxed as it is affecting trade. Hospitality businesses are having to serve fewer customers in order to adhere to social distancing rules and venues cannot operate to their full capacity, meaning a drop in revenue from ticket sales. For weeks, Northern Ireland's First Minister Paul Givan has been urging his executive colleagues to relax the rules, previously saying that he wanted to see all Covid-19 restrictions lifted by the end of September. His party colleague, Economy Minister Gordon Lyons said on Monday that he ""wanted to see movement"" on social distancing rules ""as soon as we can"". ""I have been contacted by a number of people who work in that industry who are concerned about the impact that these restrictions continue to have on the viability of their events and on their businesses as well,"" he added. However, Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill has previously argued for a more ""cautious approach"", expressing concern about infection rates and the knock-on effect on hospitals. England, Scotland and Wales have already lifted a number of social distancing requirements England abolished its mandatory social distancing measures on19 July, with a small number of exceptions for settings like hospitals, care homes and border control posts. Wales lifted its legal requirements on social distancing on7 August, leaving it to individual businesses to decide their own rules after risk assessments. Scotland dropped its social distancing requirements on9 August, but a 2m (6ft) rule remains in place for Scottish healthcare settings such as hospitals, doctors' surgeries and dentists. The business group Hospitality Ulster has been a vocal critic of Stormont's social distancing rules. After last Thursday's executive meeting, Hospitality Ulster chief executive Colin Neill said he was ""hugely disappointed by the lack of movement"" on Covid-19 restrictions. The EU's Digital Covid Certificate is being rolled out across EU member states Meanwhile, the SDLP said Infrastructure Minister Nichola Mallon had been ""blocked"" in her efforts to introduce a vaccine certification scheme for entry to some venues where social distancing measures will soon be removed. Ms Mallon argued against a proposal from the DUP and Sinn FÃ©in which will see social distancing measures dropped in indoor seated venues without the requirement of vaccine certification. Speaking after the executive's announcement, her party leader Colum Eastwood said it had been a ""moment to act"" and such a programme could have increased vaccine uptake, ""particularly in younger age groups"". ""It is astounding and reckless that DUP and Sinn FÃ©in ministers have kicked the can down the road instead of bringing certainty and clarity,"" he explained. ""Not only does this offer no incentive for vaccination it puts the onus entirely on businesses themselves. ""This is a cop out and another failure of leadership."" Previously, Sinn FÃ©in said it would support a proposal for vaccine passports to gain access to pubs and restaurants in Northern Ireland if it was recommended by Stormont health officials.

"Greg Smith called the decision to paint the new lines ""stupid"" A baffled homeowner found ""keep clear"" markings painted on the road outside his home - a converted village school which closed down 18 years ago. Greg Smith, 56, bought the building in Grewelthorpe, North Yorkshire, eight years ago. Despite his protestations, he said council contractors re-painted the zig-zag markings and suggested he black them out once they had left. North Yorkshire County Council apologised for the ""genuine mistake"". Mr Smith said the work, completed last week after roads in the village were resurfaced, had left him in the ""ridiculous"" position of risking a fine for parking outside his home. He parks his car on a small driveway next to his house, with his wife previously parking her car outside the property. ""It was a bit stupid as [the contractor] realised it wasn't a school anymore,"" Mr Smith said. ""He said: 'It's nothing to do with me mate, I'm just being paid to do the job. If I was you, I'd come out with a tin of black paint once I've gone and paint it over'."" The property has not been a primary school for almost two decades since it was converted into a house Lines outside the village's current primary school, which opened just down the road after the original's 2003 closure, were also repainted. ""There's a bit of standing joke in the village about it,"" he said. ""People find it quite funny that they'd paint the lines 18 years after it stopped being a school."" 'Mini tornado' rips through Yorkshire street 'The embarrassing way to drop off your child' More stories from across Yorkshire Mr Smith said he had tried to contact the council's highways team on several occasions but was still waiting for a response. ""You can either view it as funny or totally ridiculous,"" he said. ""Either way, it's a waste of ratepayers' money to do it and to have to paint it out."" An image taken in 2016, left, shows faint lines and the new paint job following resurfacing work Melisa Burnham, from North Yorkshire County Council's highways team, apologised for the error. She added: ""This is a genuine mistake and the lines and markings will be removed as soon as possible. ""There will be no prosecutions for people parking on the markings in the meantime.""

"Cars lined up for fuel in Stanwell, Surrey, but in many other places forecourts have shut after pumps ran dry Demand for petrol is expected to return to normal levels in the coming days, easing pressure on station forecourts, the fuel industry has said. In a joint statement, 10 companies, including BP and Shell, said there was plenty of fuel at refineries and urged people to buy it as they usually would. Earlier, the environment secretary said there were no plans at the moment to bring in the Army to drive tankers. But sources told the BBC that ministers are still seriously considering this. Meanwhile, doctors and home care staff have called for essential workers to be given priority for fuel. The Petrol Retailers Association, which represents nearly 5,500 of the UK's 8,000 filling stations, warned on Sunday that up to two-thirds of outlets were out of fuel, with the rest of them ""partly dry and running out soon"". But in a joint statement on Monday evening, a group of leading suppliers said: ""There is plenty of fuel at UK refineries and terminals, and as an industry we are working closely with the government to help ensure fuel is available to be delivered to stations across the country. ""As many cars are now holding more fuel than usual, we expect that demand will return to its normal levels in the coming days, easing pressures on fuel station forecourts."" Why are Britons panic-buying petrol? 'I'm at an Airbnb this week to avoid fuel queues' UK visa plan will not fix lorry crisis, says boss Police warning after 100 calls over fuel queues It comes after Environment Secretary George Eustice blamed queues at petrol stations and empty pumps on people buying fuel when they do not need it. He said the lack of HGV drivers would have been ""entirely manageable"" if it were not for the reaction to media coverage about a limited number of forecourt closures. ""Things will calm down. Those who are anxious - many of them will have filled up their cars with petrol now and things will then return to normal."" Mr Eustice said there were always civil contingency plans involving the Army but it was not thought necessary to call them in at the moment. Many in government are hoping this situation begins to resolve itself. They believe many people worried about shortages have already filled up their tanks - so the situation may start to die down. But if we continue to see queues at petrol stations there will be significant pressure for action. We know the new visas for HGV drivers aren't an overnight fix. So the option of sending the Army to drive tankers to forecourts is still being considered. A final decision on that has not been made. But if is does happen, extra training of armed forces personnel would be required. Ministers hope such action can be avoided. But the last few days have shown pleas for calm have not always been successful. Brian Madderson, chairman of the Petrol Retailers Association, said the industry had problems with a shortage of HGV drivers but it only became a ""critical situation"" when a submission by BP to the cabinet was leaked, sparking widespread coverage and panic buying. ""One of our members yesterday received a tanker at midday and by late afternoon the entire tanker had disappeared into people's cars,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. Mr Madderson said that customers themselves could solve the problem of pumps running dry. ""If they start buying in their normal quantities, Â£20 worth, 20 litres to fill up every week, we could see by the end of this week some return to normality - it won't be perfect, but some return,"" he said. This video can not be played Key workers and essential trips affected by panic buying Meanwhile, the lack of fuel in some forecourts has led to calls from the British Medical Association, the Royal College of Nursing and the UK Homecare Association for healthcare staff and essential workers to be given priority access. BMA chairman Dr Chaand Nagpaul said: ""As pumps run dry there is a real risk that NHS staff won't be able to do their jobs and provide vital services and care to people who urgently need it."" The UK Homecare Association said people had been left waiting for carers at home because staff have been caught in queues for petrol. Ambulances have their own fuel pumps in their depots and their supplies are expected to be prioritised, however. The shortage of lorry drivers has caused problems for a range of industries in recent months, from supermarkets to fast food chains. How serious is the HGV driver shortage? 50,000 more lorry driver tests promised a year Temporary visa plan to ease lorry driver shortage Visas won't solve petrol supply issues - retailers The government said on Sunday it wouldtemporarily exempt fuel companies from competition law,as part of ""long-standing"" contingency plans to maintain supplies, allowing them to target supplies at areas most in need. On Saturday,the government also announced it would offertemporary visas, lasting until Christmas Eve, to 5,000 foreign fuel tanker and food lorry drivers and 5,500 poultry workers in a bid to limit disruption in the build up to Christmas. Other measures include sending nearly one million letters to drivers who hold an HGV licence - to encourage them back into the industry - and plans to train 4,000 people to become HGV drivers. A survey from earlier this year suggests a number of reasons for the driver shortage Elizabeth de Jong, director of policy for Logistics UK, told Today that it would be ""days, possibly a couple of weeks"" before the visa applications were open. She said the industry had wanted more visas to be available and for a longer time, but she said the key issue now was to make them attractive to drivers, which was likely to mean offering good wages. The UK had lost 72,000 drivers between the second quarter of 2019 and the same period in 2021, Ms de Jong said - partly due to people returning to the EU after Brexit. At the same time, she said the pandemic had disrupted testing for HGV licences, making it harder to replace the lost drivers. But Mr Eustice denied that Brexit had been a major factor in the driver shortage. ""None of this is because we have left the European Union,"" he said. ""The biggest factor has been Covid.""

"There were queues at many petrol stations on Monday, including in Friern Barnet, north London The Army is ready to help ease fuel supply problems after a fourth day of long queues and pump closures. Up to 150 military tanker drivers will prepare to deliver to forecourts which have run dry because of panic buying. The surge in demand came amid fears a driver shortage would hit fuel supply - which is plentiful at refineries. The transport secretary said there were ""tentative signs"" of stabilisation in petrol stations and queues would start to reflect this in the coming days. Grant Shapps said: ""Once we all return to our normal buying habits... the quicker we get back to normality."" The Petrol Retailers Association (PRA) said there were ""early signs"" the pressure on petrol stations was starting to ease, The organisation, which represents nearly 5,500 of the UK's 8,000 stations, said around 37% of its sites had run out of fuel. That is a big improvement on the situation on Sunday, when two-thirds had run dry. ""With regular restocks taking place, this percentage [of petrol stations with fuel] is likely to improve further over the next 24 hours,"" it added in a statement. Why are there long queues for petrol in the UK? Outlook bleak as petrol prices surge, says RAC 'I'm at an Airbnb this week to avoid fuel queues' UK visa plan will not fix lorry crisis, says boss The UK is estimated to be short of more than 100,000 lorry drivers - causing problems for a range of industries, including food suppliers and supermarkets, in recent months. The government has said people needlessly buying fuel has led to queues at many forecourts, with fuel running out in some places. But there are growing calls for key workers, such as health and social care staff, to receive priority access to available fuel after some reported not being able to get to work due to the supply issues. Daniyal Ahsan, a junior doctor in London, told the BBC he went to 17 petrol stations after work on Monday in search of fuel - but wasn't able to get any, leaving him concerned about how this would affect his patients. He has since been able to fill up his car. Dr Jane Townson, chief executive of UK Homecare Association, warned that some people who depend on carers for tasks like taking pain medication could die if they are left without help. Roger Grosvenor, of the East of England Co-op petrol stations, told the BBC the group would create a daily priority hour for emergency workers if fuel supply problems had not eased by Thursday. Motoring group the RAC said the price of a litre of unleaded petrol had risen by a penny since Friday to an eight-year high - and knew a small number of retailers had been hiking prices amid the soaring demand. It added it had seen a ""sharp increase"" in the number of drivers who had broken down after running out of fuel - with engineers attending twice as many breakdowns on Monday than it would normally see over a whole week. The AA motoring organisation said it had seen a ""dramatic rise"" in motorists putting the wrong fuel in vehicles compared to last weekend. Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng said the move to place the Army on standby was a ""sensible, precautionary step"" and if troops had to be deployed, they would temporarily ""provide the supply chain with additional capacity"" to ease the pressure caused by increased fuel demand. The BBC has been told that 75 military drivers are on standby initially, and another 75 could be added if needed. They require up to five days of specialised training. Huw Merriman, a Conservative MP and chairman of the transport select committee, said readying the army was a ""good example"" of ministers trying to use as many levers at their disposal as possible, and would be used as a ""last resort"" if the situation did not stabilise in the next couple of days. But Mr Merriman told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the industry must explain how it planned to fix long-standing driver shortages rather than having the government constantly step in. ""These problems have been there for years because the average age of the driver is 55 years old, they're retiring, and the industry has not made this job attractive. For too long, working conditions have been poor, and those that are willing to tolerate it have been from abroad."" It is hoped that with many cars now holding more fuel than usual, demand will return to normal levels soon The government has also authorised an extension to special driver licences that allow drivers to transport goods such as fuel. ADR licences due to expire between 27 September and 31 December will have their validity extended until 31 January 2022, without refresher training or exams. Labour said the latest response to the fuel crisis was ""an admission of failure"" and that asking the Army to step up was ""a sticking plaster"". Leading fuel companies, including BP and Shell, have sought to reassure the public that supplies remain unaffected at source. In a joint statement, they said that given ""many cars are now holding more fuel than usual"" they expected demand would ""return to its normal levels in the coming days"". This video can not be played Key workers and essential trips affected by panic buying Doctors, nurses, and unions for teachers, prison and care staff have called for essential workers to be given priority for fuel. Some ambulance trusts have their own fuel pumps in depots and their supplies are expected to be prioritised - but essential workers can still be caught out. Unison urged ministers to ""designate fuel stations for the sole use of key workers"" while the NASUWT union called for teachers to be prioritised to safeguard children's education. But the headteachers' union NAHT said prioritising key workers for fuel was ""not a sensible solution as it would be impossible to enforce and could cause more chaos on the forecourts"". And Brian Madderson, chairman of the Petrol Retailers Association, said trying to decide who was and was not an emergency worker and how they would prove this in petrol stations was ""very complex"" and ""hopefully"" a last resort. Asked about the prospect of priority for key workers, Mr Shapps said he would keep a ""close eye"" on the situation and the government would do ""whatever it takes"". Elsewhere, Carol Curry, who needed fuel to drive her husband to a hospital appointment, said she blamed the media for frenzied scenes at the pumps. ""If nobody had said about this, the lorry drivers and everything, then this panic wouldn't have started,"" she said. How serious is the HGV driver shortage? 50,000 more lorry driver tests promised a year Temporary visa plan to ease lorry driver shortage Visas won't solve petrol supply issues - retailers The government hastemporarily exempted fuel companies from competition law,allowing them to work together to target supplies at areas most in need. Temporary visas lasting until Christmas Eve for 5,000 foreign fuel tanker and food lorry drivers, and 5,500 poultry workers,have also been announced. Nearly one million drivers qualified to drive heavy goods vehicles are being encouraged to rejoin the sector, and some 3,000 new recruits are expected to undertake short, intensive driving courses. Factors including Brexit, the pandemic, pay levels and an aging workforce have all contributed to a shortage of lorry drivers. After the UK left the EU, many European drivers returned to their home countries, or decided to work elsewhere because of the additional border bureaucracy and the impact it had on their income. The pandemic also prompted many foreign drivers to return home and led to a huge backlog in HGV driver exams. Driver shortages have also been seen in EU countries, including Germany and Poland.

"This video can not be played Emily Thornberry says it is âfactually inaccurateâ to say that only women have a cervix. Emily Thornberry has backed the Labour leader's stance in a row over whether only women have cervixes. The shadow trade secretary said it was ""factually inaccurate"" to make the claim when some trans men and non-binary people also have a cervix. It comes after a Labour MP supported online criticism of a tweet referring to ""individuals with a cervix"". Rosie Duffield was called transphobic by trans rights supporters - but she has rejected the claim. Asked about the incident on Sunday, Sir Keir said it was ""not right"" to say only women have a cervix, and called for a ""mature, respectful debate"" around the issue. He added: ""We need to... bear in mind that the trans community are amongst the most marginalised and abused communities."" Starmer: Not right to say only women have a cervix What does transgender mean and what does the law say? Labour leader meets MP over transgender debate Appearing on BBC Two's Politics Live on Monday, Ms Thornberry said she agreed with her leader's stance on the issue. ""It is factually inaccurate [as] there are men who have cervixes,"" she said. ""There are men who are trans. And they are men. It is just factually wrong [to say otherwise]."" She said people who identified as men with cervixes ""often, frankly, have had quite a hard time in the way in which they live their lives"", adding: ""To then have some people still shouting at them saying, 'you are wrong, you are a woman, I don't care what you say', then I think we start getting into transphobia. ""I think we need to have a little more tolerance and a little less shouting at each other, quite frankly. I am personally really sad that a great party like ours is having this kind of level of debate."" Ms Thornberry added: ""It is just people trying to live their lives and we should have a bit of understanding."" Canterbury MP Ms Duffield has regularly used social media to outline her own position on transgender issues - especially around the debate on the Gender Recognition Act. Some groups are calling for the medical diagnosis element of the process to change gender to be scrapped in England and Wales, allowing people to self-identify. But Ms Duffield believes that biological females should have protected spaces where biological males are not allowed to go - such as domestic violence refuges and prisons - and she is against people being able to self-identify as trans to gain access to those spaces. The Labour MP has said she is ""completely supportive of trans rights"". But she has been condemned by some LGBT+ groups - who say trans men and women should be treated the same as biological men and women - and two of her staff members resigned from her office over her views. Labour MP Rosie Duffield is not attending Labour's party conference this week In August, Ms Duffield liked a tweet by broadcaster Piers Morgan, who criticised a news story from CNN about cancer screening for ""individuals with a cervix"", responding: ""Do you mean women?"" When the MP was called transphobic for appearing to endorse the tweet, she replied: ""I'm a 'transphobe' for knowing that only women have a cervixâ¦ ?!"" She later acknowledged that some trans men have a cervix. Sir Keir told the BBC's Andrew Marr that saying only women have a cervix was ""something that shouldn't be said"" and it was ""not right"".

"This video can not be played Olaf Scholz of Germany's Social Democratic Party: ""Many voters... wanted a change in government"" Germany's centre-left Social Democrats (SPD) have claimed victory in the federal election, telling the party of outgoing Chancellor Angela Merkel it should no longer be in power. SPD leader Olaf Scholz said he had a clear mandate to form a government, while his conservative rival Armin Laschet remains determined to fight on. The two parties have governed together for years. But Mr Scholz says it is time for a new coalition with the Greens and liberals. Preliminary results gave his party a narrow election win over the conservatives who suffered their worst-ever performance. Despite this, Mr Laschet said his party had given him its backing to enter talks with coalition partners, pushing Germany towards a potentially protracted power struggle. The Greens and pro-business Free Democratic Party (FDP) attracted the most support from the under-30s, in an election dominated by climate change and by differing proposals on how to tackle it. The Greens made history with almost 15% of the vote, even though it was well short of their ambitions. It was the tightest race in years, bringing an end to the post-war domination of the two big parties - Mr Scholz's SPD and his rival's conservative Christian Democratic Union (CDU). Exit polls predicted a dead heat, but this election was unpredictable from the start, and the result was never going to be the end of the story. For one thing, the outgoing chancellor is going nowhere until the coalition is formed - and that may have to wait until Christmas. The main parties want a new government in place by the time Germany takes over the leadership of the G7 group of nations in January. The next chancellor's task is to lead Europe's foremost economy over the next four years, with climate change at the top of voters' agenda. German elections usher in change with a small 'c' 'Bazooka man' Scholz aiming for German chancellor Mr Scholz's SPD supporters greeted him in raptures, but it was only later when his party edged into the lead that he told a televised audience the voters had given him the job of forming a ""good, pragmatic government for Germany"". Speaking on Monday he said there were three parties that were on the up - his party, the Greens and the liberals - and it was time for the conservatives to back down. ""I think that the people in Germany want the Christian Democratic Union in opposition. This is their result now, what they decided during the election,"" he said in English. This video can not be played Swipe left or right? Germany's election dating game, explained His conservative rival has dug in, arguing it was about forging a coalition, not about getting ""an arithmetic majority"". Winner doesn't take all, in other words. On Monday, Mr Laschet said ""no party has emerged from this election with a clear mandate to form a government"". He said he would lead ""exploratory talks"" with the liberal FDP and the Greens - the favoured coalition partners of the CDU/CSU alliance. CDU General Secretary Paul Ziemiak did not gloss over the defeat early on Monday but said that was not the point: ""In the end the question is going to be can you create a genuine project for the future?"" ""Two maybe-chancellors and two kingmakers"" - was one of the headlines summing up Sunday night's rather scrappy result, but that is what it looked like. Because it's not just the Social Democrat and conservative leaders fighting for power. The two kingmakers are open to offers and planning to talk to each other to explore common ground. Together the liberals and the Greens make up over quarter of the vote and would carry both of the big parties over the line. They may be more popular with younger voters than any other parties, but it would take some skill to bring them under the same roof. A Greens spokesman on Monday said it was no big secret that they were not close to the liberals. Greens leader Annalena Baerbock wants to loosen Germany's debt brake that stops a big jump in public debt. FDP leader Christian Lindner has little time for her party's ""ideas of tax hikes, or softening the debt brake"". So of all the possible coalitions, the Greens and the liberals feature in the two that are most likely to form. One is the so-called traffic-light coalition, made up of the parties' colours - red (SPD), yellow (FDP) and the Greens - or there's the Jamaica alternative, black (CDU), yellow (FDP) and the Greens. It is the first time that Germany is facing a three-way coalition, but this country has entered a new political era and the talking is yet to begin. Beyond the four mainstream parties, it was a bad night for the radical left and a patchy night for the far right. Left-wing Die Linke fell below the 5% threshold required to get into parliament but survived because it secured three direct mandates. And although the far-right AfD's share of the vote appears to have slipped nationally, it's set be the largest party in the eastern states of Saxony and Thuringia.

"There have been several protests around the M25 in the past two weeks Climate change protesters have defied a court order and blocked part of the M25 at Heathrow Airport. A total of 53 people have been arrested as Insulate Britain blocked the slip road at junction 14 just after 08:00 BST. The road has now reopened. A High Court injunctionbanning protests around the M25 and Dartford Crossing was issued last Thursday. ""You can throw as many injunctions at us as you like, but we are going nowhere,"" the campaign group said. Police have arrested 53 people Ministers had hoped the High Court injunction would prevent further disruption around London It is the latest of several protests targeting major roads in the south east. The order, which was granted to National Highways Ltd, states demonstrators are banned from ""causing damage to the surface of or to any apparatus on or around the M25 including but not limited to painting, damaging by fire, or affixing any item or structure thereto"". The blocked junction has since fully reopened It adds that those involved ""may be held to be in contempt of court and may be imprisoned, fined or have their assets seized."" The injunction includes slip roads and bridges. Ministers had hoped the High Court injunction would prevent further disruption around London. In statements read out last week at the Home Office, the campaigners said: ""We are more scared of the destruction of our country than we are of breaking an injunction. ""There are times when we have to step up and do what is right."" The group, an offshoot of Extinction Rebellion, is calling for the government to insulate homes in the UK to help cut carbon emissions. It wants heat-saving measures installed in social housing by 2025 and all homes by 2030. Protesters were dragged away from the protest Protester Dr Diana Warner, 62, a retired GP from Bristol, said she was protesting out of ""desperation"". ""This is the fifth time I've been here trying to block a motorway because the only way to get the government to listen is to disrupt things,"" she said. Ms Warner added she ""completely understood"" people's frustrations with the protest however what was at risk was the ""lives of our children and grandchildren"". ""I'm really sorry but I'm determined to do everything I can to make us safe and change society ... we have to try.""

Ms Rayner said: ""If he withdraws his comments and apologises, I'll be very happy to apologise to him."" But Labour's Shadow Scotland Secretary Ian Murraytold the New Statesman,externalshe should apologise as politicians should ""lead by example"".

Conservative Party co-chair Oliver Dowden said: ""Voters have heard the message loud and clear from Labour conference: if they support Conservative values or this government they are 'scum'.

"This video can not be played A church in the village of Arkalochori was reduced to a pile of rubble At least one person has been killed and several injured after a 5.8-magnitude earthquake hit the Greek island of Crete, local officials say. The man died when the dome of a church that was being renovated in the town of Arkalochori caved in. People were sent rushing out on to the streets when the earthquake struck at 09:17 (06:17 GMT). Many buildings were damaged and some reduced to piles of rubble from the initial quake and strong aftershocks. People who live in damaged, older buildings are being advised to stay outdoors. Some 2,500 tents were set up to house those who could not safely return to their homes on Monday, government minister Christos Stylianidis told Greece's Ant1 news. He also declared a state of emergency in the Heraklion region - where Arkalochori is located. British woman Millie Mackay and her nine-year-old daughter Eleni are on holiday in Crete and were in their ground floor hotel room when the earthquake hit. ""Glasses started smashing so we ran outside by the pool,"" Ms Mackay told the BBC. ""There the bosses guided us to a place of safety... [The manager] was then calling out room numbers and checking if everyone was out and OK."" Local resident Evangelia Christaki told AFP news agency that she had just enough time to grab her husband, who has a disability, and run outside as her house shook. ""Fortunately, our home was not too badly damaged,"" she said. ""But the authorities have told us to stay outdoors over the next hours. In any case, we are so scared."" The small farming town of Arkalochori, located about 30km (18 miles) from the island's capital Heraklion, was particularly badly hit by the earthquake. Pictures from the area show damaged shop fronts and crumbled buildings. Local media is reporting that safety inspections are now under way, with members of Greece's disaster response unit flown in with sniffer dogs and specialised rescue equipment. Rescuers searched through the rubble of the demolished church in Arkalochori ""This is not an event that occurred without warning,"" seismologist Gerasimos Papadopoulos said on Greece's state broadcaster, ERT. ""We have seen activity in this region for several months. This was a strong earthquake, it was not under sea but under land and affecting populated areas,"" he added. The European Mediterranean Seismological Centre (EMSC) initially recorded a magnitude of 6.5 while the United States Geological Survey (USGS) put it at 6.0. The Athens Geodynamic Institute later said the 5.8 quake struck 23km (14 miles) north-west of the coastal village of Arvi, at a depth of 10km. Both Greece and Turkey sit on fault lines and earthquakes are common. Have you been affected by the earthquake?

"The pop star is known for hits like Murder On The Dancefloor and Groovejet Sophie Ellis-Bextor has spoken out about being raped at the age of 17 by an older musician. Writing in her new memoir, Spinning Plates, the singer says she lost her virginity in the incident at the apartment of a guitarist, who was 29. ""I heard myself saying 'No' and 'I don't want to,'"" she writes, ""but it didn't make any difference"". ""He had sex with me and I felt so ashamed. It was how I lost my virginity and I felt stupid."" She continued: ""I felt grubby, but also unsure about my own feelings as I had no other experience to compare it with."" In the book, which is being serialised in the Mail On Sunday, Ellis-Bextor describes how she met the musician - who she calls Jim - at a gig while she was studying for her A-Levels. He invited her back to his flat to see his history books ""and before I knew it we were on his bed and he took off my knickers"". The singer, who is now 42, says she was left confused following the incident as the public perception of rape in the 1990s ""was not to do with consent"" but rather ""something you associated with aggression"". ""But no one had pinned me down or shouted at me to make me comply,"" she says, adding that ""the things I saw and read and the way sex was discussed [at the time] made me believe I didn't have a case."" If you have been affected bysexual abuse or violence, help and support is available atBBC Action Line. According to Rape Crisis England and Wales, this perception still persists - with many victims believing they have no case if there are no physical signs of struggle or assault. The charity says there ""aremany reasons,externalwhy someone might not scream or struggle"". In fact, it says, ""quietness and stillness might suggest a lack of those crucial elements of freedom and capacity"". Misconceptions like these can make it difficult for survivors to seek help, with many fearing they will not be believed, it adds. Ellis-Bextor says she had decided to share her own experience to help people understand ""where the line between right and wrong lies"". ""My experience was not violent,"" she writes in her memoir. ""All that happened was I wasn't listened to. Of the two people there, one said yes, the other said no, and the yes person did it anyway. ""The older I've become, the more stark that 29-year-old man ignoring 17-year-old me has seemed."" As the mother of five sons, Ellis-Bextor says she had been careful to introduce them to the concept of consent. ""I want to raise considerate, kind people who can take other people's feelings into account,"" she writes. ""I want them to actively want the other person to be happy, too, rather than just stopping because they have to.""

"Some group members arrived in Downing Street carrying pictures of lost loved ones Boris Johnson has promised to appoint a chair for the official Covid inquiry before Christmas, after meeting a campaign group. Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice said he also pledged to involve them in the decision, during a meeting with them in Downing Street. The PM met the group earlier, having declined to do so since last year. It has been campaigning for a public inquiry into the pandemic, due to start in spring 2022, to begin immediately. Five families from the group met Mr Johnson on Tuesday for a private reception, to share stories of their loved ones lost due to Covid. Afterwards, they said they were pleased he had met them - but they were ""still disappointed by the lack of urgency"" over an inquiry start date. Tories reverse decision to ban Covid families group Covid families reject PM's reason for not meeting Start Covid-19 inquiry now, say bereaved families A No 10 spokesperson said the PM had promised the group the inquiry would ""get to the bottom of many of the questions that they, and thousands of others like them, have about the pandemic"". ""The prime minister gave a commitment that the chair of the inquiry would be appointed by Christmas,"" they added. ""He set out that for now, it is right that public servants continue to focus their efforts on tackling the pandemic before moving on to the inquiry in the spring of next year."" This video can not be played Hannah, who lost both her dad and grandmother to Covid, met with the prime minister. Speaking afterwards, Mr Johnson told reporters the meeting had been ""very emotional"". ""Obviously there's very little I could say to mitigate their own suffering,"" he added. ""But what I did say is we are determined to make sure the experience of the bereaved is something we took account of in the public inquiry."" The group, representing families with relatives who have died with the virus, has been asking for a meeting with Mr Johnson since last year. However, he has previously turned down a meeting with them, citing a threat of legal action over an official pandemic inquiry. The groupwrote to the government in August last year, saying it was considering a judicial review of the decision not to hold an immediate public inquiry. But the group denied that legal action had started - and labelled Mr Johnson's reason for not meeting them a ""poor excuse"". The PM gave his support to the National Covid Memorial Wall, suggesting it could become a permanent memorial In May, Mr Johnson announced a statutory public inquiry into the government's handling of the pandemic would begin in spring 2022. The group's meeting with the PM comes a week before it attends the Conservative Party annual conference, beginning in Manchester on Sunday. The group says it was initially denied permission to attend, before subsequently being told they could after ""the news broke in the media"". In a statement after the meeting, the group said families expect to be consulted on the appointment of a chair and the inquiry's terms of reference. It added Mr Johnson also gave his support to the National Covid Memorial Wall, suggesting it could become a permanent national memorial. ""Although we wish this meeting had taken place a long time ago, we're pleased that the prime minister has chosen to finally engage with us,"" the statement added. ""However, we are still disappointed by the lack of urgency the prime minister displayed, as we see no reason why preparations for the inquiry cannot begin now, particularly as nearly 1,000 people are still losing their lives each week.""

We'll be back with more tomorrow. Your updates were written by Emma Harrison, Jennifer Meierhans and Lauren Turner. The page was edited by James Clarke and Chris Lansdown. We are going to be bringing the live page to a close soon so here's a recap of the day's coronavirus developments: People queue for a coronavirus vaccine in Egyptian capital Cairo Earlier today we heard that Wales is to merge the green and amber country lists, joining England which had already announced it was going to do so from 4 October. The red list - for countries considered highest risk - will remain, with arrivals still needing to pay for a quarantine hotel. The change means fully vaccinated travellersarriving from non-red list countries,externalwill no longer have to take a PCR or lateral flow test before they set off for the UK. This includes people vaccinatedin the UK, the EU, the US or 18 other recognised countries,external. Travellers will still have to take a PCR test two days after arrival. People who are not fully vaccinated willstill need a pre-departure test and a PCR test,externalon days two and eight after they return. They must also self-isolate for 10 days. Test to Release,externalwill remain an option for unvaccinated passengers to England who want to shorten quarantine. But what else is changing and which tests do you need for going on holiday? We've got an explainerherewith all the information you might need if you are going away. Phil McCannBBC News I told you earlier about some of the Covid survivors I met at the the Royal Preston Hospital. Here's the moment an emotional Jean told me she believes the vaccine saved her life. This video can not be played The furlough scheme, which protected millions of jobs during the pandemic, is being wound up at later this week, at the end of September From March 2020 to the end of this month, the cost of furlough will come to about Â£66bn, according to estimates from the Office for Budget Responsibility. That's a huge sum, about one fifth of the money the government has spent on the response to Covid. The government says it has supported 11.6 million jobs in that time. With it coming to an end, many forecasters, including the Bank of England, are expecting a small rise in unemployment after furlough ends. That's because some employers with workers on furlough may find they cannot afford to keep them on when furlough ends. International travel - and other businesses which depend on it, are still seriously disrupted. Some furloughed workers in these areas may lose their jobs. You can read more on furloughhere. Let's take a look at what the daily figures tell us about the coronavirus situation in the UK today. Case numbers are still high with another 37,960 new infections in today's data. But deaths are steadying with another 40 reported. Some schools in Cumbria have asked pupils to wear face masks again because of rising Covid-19 cases in the area. Health bosses are now reviewing whether to introduce the move across the whole county - despite it not being required under England's national guidelines. County public health director Colin Cox said Cumbria was seeing the highest levels ever but only among children and young people. Schools in west Cumbria have seen the most ""significant outbreaks"", Cox says. Last week some secondary schools saw 4,000 coronavirus cases per 100,000 in the Allerdale council area. And it was announced last week that siblings of positive children in the county were being told to isolate to try to reduce infection rates. The pupils were told they should also take a PCR test before returning to school. Read more here. NI's largest Covid-19 vaccination centre opened at the Odyssey SSE Arena in Belfast in March 2021 As we are reporting, the UK has fully-vaccinated more than two thirds of the entire population, but take-up of the jab continues to vary by country, according to analysis by the PA news agency. While Scotland and Wales have both managed to give two doses of vaccine to 70% of their respective populations, the equivalent figure for Northern Ireland is just over 63%. In England the figure currently stands at just under two-thirds. There is also wide variation among age groups. At least 95% of people in Scotland in all groups aged 55 and over have had both doses, but in Wales this threshold has been reached just for groups aged 70 and over. In England it has been reached only for people aged 60 to 64 and 70 to 79. Northern Ireland reports its vaccination uptake in larger age groups, with the latest data suggesting two doses have been given to more than 95% of people aged 60-69, 70-79 and 80 and over. The UK has joined a handful of countries to have fully vaccinated more than two-thirds of its entire population against Covid-19. More than 44.7 million second doses have now been delivered in the UK, according to government figures - the equivalent of just over 66.6% of the total population. Other countries to have already passed this figure include Canada, with at least 70% of people fully vaccinated, Chile at 73% and Singapore at 76%. A number of European nations have also beaten the UK to the milestone of two-thirds fully jabbed, such as Italy with 67%, Belgium at 71%, Ireland with 73% and Spain at 77%. Portugal continues to lead the world, however, with at least 84% of its total population having now received two doses of the vaccine. Figures for other countries have been compiled by Our World in Data using the latest official information from governments and health ministries. Covid vaccines: How fast is progress around the world? The UK has fully vaccinated more than two thirds of its population but, as more people are fully-jabbed, the rate of vaccinations is slowing The UK has given a total of 93,500,858 coronavirus vaccinations. That's 48,736,534 first doses and 44,764,324 second doses. Here's how the UK's vaccine rollout is goingin charts. There have been a further 40 coronavirus-related deaths in the UK,according to the government's daily statistics.,external And 37,960 new infections have also been recorded - that's the highest figure since 9 September. The town with England's highest rate of Covid infections has seen its figure nearly double within a week. Kettering, in Northamptonshire, saw 900 cases per 100,000 people in the week to 22 September. The number rose sharply among secondary school-aged pupils, which officials say accounts for most cases. The county's joint director of public health Lucy Wightman is urging people to ""continue to play their part in preventing further spread"". Parents and students have been asked to test themselves twice a week. Officials say secondary school children suspected of having the virusshould not go in until they have had a negative PCR test. Scottish Labour has reported the Test and Protect system's data on coronavirus contact tracing times to the UK's statistics watchdog. It follows a report that official figures did not include ""failed"" contact tracing attempts - where the Test and Protect team were not able to reach positive cases by phone. The Scottish Sun reported there had been more than 50,000 such failed cases in a year, making up about 10% of all Test and Protect cases. The newspaper says these failed cases were not included in the weekly figures published by Public Health Scotland (PHS), which are used to determine if the system is meeting the international standard of the World Health Organization (WHO). The target is for 80% of cases to have their close contacts traced and quarantined within 72 hours of the case being confirmed. The Scottish Government says it is confident in its interpretation of the PHS data and how it relates to the WHO standard. A spokesman for the UK Statistics Authority confirms it has received a complaint from Scottish Labour's health spokeswoman Jackie Baillie. These people are all in masks - but never wearing one in enclosed spaces raises the chances of testing positive, the survey found The Office for National Statistics (ONS)has released its latest report,externalon who is most likely to be testing positive for coronavirus at the moment. The dates it looked at were the fortnight ending 11 September, and it covers all of the UK. It found that people who had received at least one dose of a coronavirus vaccine were less likely to test positive for coronavirus. And those more likely to record a positive test included:  The data comes from people taking part in the ONS coronavirus infection survey - a large household monitoring survey that looks at infection within the community. It excludes those in hospitals, care homes and other institutional settings.  Patience AtuhaireBBC News, Kampala Uganda is ramping up vaccination of priority populations A study by Ugandan scientists has found vaccination against
Covid-19 significantly reduced deaths in the country. There were no deaths recorded among fully vaccinated patients during the research period. There were also fewer deaths among those who were partially vaccinated. The study, conducted between May and July this year, used data collected
from 1,462 patients admitted at two of the largest Covid-19 treatment centres in the capital, Kampala. Some were fully vaccinated while others had only received their first
dose of AstraZeneca, which was the only vaccine available in the country
then. The researchers from Makerere University, working under the
institutionâs Research and Innovation and Fund, also found vaccinated
patients were 45% less likely to die during hospitalisation. It was done during a period when Covid infections threatened to
overwhelm the health system, as the country suffered its second wave. The study is being published at a time when Uganda is ramping up
vaccination of priority populations. From Monday, teachers and students above 18 years will be offered a vaccine as the government targets a phased reopening of the
education sector starting in November. Uganda has recorded a total of 3,146 Covid-19 deaths since the pandemic
begun. Nearly two million vaccine jabs have so far been given out countrywide.

Online applications can now be made for Â£100 high street vouchers to spend in places like clothing retailers and hospitality venues before the end of November. Read more Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent The fuel supply problemsin parts of the UK have an impact on the NHS like the rest
of society. Ambulance services have their own fuel pumps at their depots
so there is no immediate risk that a crew in need of fuel should not be able to
fill up their tanks today. Those in-house pumps will need restocking at some point and
clearly ambulance services will be prioritised for supplies. There is â as one service put it â no realistic scenario
where ambulances run out of fuel. But the bigger concern is for staff who are travelling
around in their own vehicles, either to get to work or to see patients in the
community. Nearly all are reliant on using public petrol stations.
Already the UK Homecare Association has raised concern that the service
provided by carers in peopleâs homes has been disrupted with staff running out
of petrol and caught in queues, ending up late for calls. The association, along with others like the British Medical
Association, are calling for health and care staff to be prioritised for fuel. During previous fuel shortages councils have arranged
systems to ensure essential workers are able to fill up their cars. The message coming from a number of health and care bodies
is that this must be brought in and quickly.  Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst Zhong Nanshan is China's answer to Chris Whitty, England's chief medical officer Cases of Covid-19 persist in two Chinese provinces, and are threatening peopleâs plans for an upcoming national holiday. Golden Week - from 1-7 October - is fast approaching, the second biggest travel period in China after the Lunar New Year. This year, 650 million Chinese are expected totravel for the festivities,external. The holiday begins with Chinaâs National Day, and Chinaâs answer to Chris Whitty, Zhong Nanshan, has this year sung a songto mark the country's ""birthday"".,external However, cases of Covid-19 are still being identified daily in two Chinese provinces: northeast Heilongjiang and southeast Fujian province. The Ministry of Culture and Tourism earlier warned that travel companies might have to âimmediately suspend trans-provincial group tours, air tickets and hotel reservation servicesâif these regions canât drop their daily cases to zero.,external There have been more than 400 cases confirmed in Fujian in recent weeks.  But the South China Morning Post newspapernotes today that cases have eased in the province,external. However, the national Global Times newspaper says that in Heilongjiang, cases have spread beyond Harbin,the one city where the virus had been identified,external. Both regions are discouraging residents against travelling and are rolling out mass testing drives to identify symptomatic and asymptomatic people. As we've heard today, letters offering Covid vaccination appointments are beingsent out to 12 to 15-year-oldsin Scotland. Every child in this age group in the UK is now being offered a single vaccination dose. InScotland, as well as being invited to book an appointment at a clinic, 12 to 15-year-olds can get vaccinated at drop-in centres. InEnglandandNorthern Ireland,the programme is mostly based in schools. And inWales, vaccination centres are being used, withdifferent arrangements in place between areas. It is hoped the measure will help prevent further disruption to their education. Vaccinating children should help keep cases down, although it won't stop the spread of Covid in schools. Evidence suggests a single jab cuts the risk of catching the Delta variant by about 55%. It also reduces the chances of getting very sick or spreading it to someone else.

Speaking in Brighton, Rachel Reeves criticised the government for awarding contracts to ""friends and donors"" of the Conservative Party during the pandemic, saying: ""Let's review some of the highlights of the Tories' pandemic outsourcing bonanza. ""Â£90m to one business which had donated Â£400,000 to the Conservative Party, not a bad return on their investment. Â£150m to a financial services firm to produce 50 million facemasks that couldn't be used! ""Â£350m to a company employing a sitting Tory MP, for test kits which had to be recalled. Â£30m to Matt Hancock's pub landlord. And every single one of those cheques signed by Rishi Sunak."" ""To those who have secured Covid contracts and have not delivered. I give you notice.

"There have been several protests around the M25 in the past two weeks Climate change protesters have defied a court order and blocked part of the M25 at Heathrow Airport. A total of 53 people have been arrested as Insulate Britain blocked the slip road at junction 14 just after 08:00 BST. The road has now reopened. A High Court injunctionbanning protests around the M25 and Dartford Crossing was issued last Thursday. ""You can throw as many injunctions at us as you like, but we are going nowhere,"" the campaign group said. Police have arrested 53 people Ministers had hoped the High Court injunction would prevent further disruption around London It is the latest of several protests targeting major roads in the south east. The order, which was granted to National Highways Ltd, states demonstrators are banned from ""causing damage to the surface of or to any apparatus on or around the M25 including but not limited to painting, damaging by fire, or affixing any item or structure thereto"". The blocked junction has since fully reopened It adds that those involved ""may be held to be in contempt of court and may be imprisoned, fined or have their assets seized."" The injunction includes slip roads and bridges. Ministers had hoped the High Court injunction would prevent further disruption around London. In statements read out last week at the Home Office, the campaigners said: ""We are more scared of the destruction of our country than we are of breaking an injunction. ""There are times when we have to step up and do what is right."" The group, an offshoot of Extinction Rebellion, is calling for the government to insulate homes in the UK to help cut carbon emissions. It wants heat-saving measures installed in social housing by 2025 and all homes by 2030.

""This is the fifth time I've been here trying to block a motorway because the only way to get the government to listen is to disrupt things,"" she said. Ms Warner added she ""completely understood"" people's frustrations with the protest however what was at risk was the ""lives of our children and grandchildren"".

"Accountancy firm  Grant Thornton has been fined Â£2.3m for failures in its audits of collapsed cake chain Patisserie Valerie. The fine was for audits carried out between 2015 and 2017, regulator the Financial Reporting Council said. It said Grant Thornton had ""missed red flags"" and failed to ""question information provided by management,"" Grant Thornton admitted to not following audit rules. It must report annually to show how it is improving. David Newstead, who carried out the audits, was also fined Â£150,000 for his role in signing off the accounts. Claudia Mortimore, deputy executive counsel to the FRC, said: ""This decision notice sets out numerous breaches of relevant requirements across three separate audit years, evidencing a serious lack of competence in conducting the audit work."" The fine was originally Â£4m, but was adjusted for aggravating and mitigating factors and discounted to Â£2.34m. Mr Newstead's Â£150,000 fine was adjusted to Â£87,750 for the same reasons. In addition he has been banned from carrying out audits for three years. ""The package of financial and non-financial sanctions should help to improve the quality of future audits,"" said Ms Mortimore. Grant Thornton - Britain's sixth largest accountancy firm - had previously been fined Â£650,000 in December 2019 over the botched audit of a listed company. The Financial Reporting Council said it fined the accounting firm after it identified a series of errors surrounding its work for an unnamed company in 2016. In October 2018, Patisserie Holdings announced that its board had been notified of potentially fraudulent accounting irregularities. The company subsequently entered into administration, leading to the closure of 70 stores and more than 900 job losses. The collapse followed the discovery of a huge black hole in the firm's accounts, eventually valued at Â£94m. After it went into administration, the cafe chain was found to have overstated its cash position by Â£30m and failed to disclose overdrafts of nearly Â£10m. In June 2019 five people were arrested and questioned over the alleged accounting fraud, the Serious Fraud Office reported. A spokesperson for Grant Thornton said the company has invested significantly in audit practice since the scandal. He added: ""We have co-operated fully with the FRC and acknowledge the investigation's findings relating to our audits in 2015-2017. ""We regret the quality of our work fell short of what was expected of us in this instance."" A civil case had previously been launched against Grant Thornton by liquidators at FRP Advisory, claiming the auditor was negligent. Patisserie Valerie was an unusual corporate collapse. Most come with some type of warning - a whistleblower, a deteriorating trading performance or the resignation of key executives - but the bakery chain simply imploded. It had expanded quickly and appeared to be in the rudest financial health until it realised its accounts were a fiction. The cash position was wildly inflated and there were two bank loans of which the board was not aware. The shares were suspended in October 2018, and despite an emergency cash injection from shareholders led by chairman Luke Johnson, the company was put into administration the following January.  A management buyout meant a slimmed down version of the chain continues to trade. That might have been the end of it, but the timing of the default meant it led to profound reform in the mechanism of safeguards around British companies, some of which are still being implemented and indeed bickered over. There had been a similar failure 10 months earlier, when Carillion, a giant construction and services group, also ran out of cash. With Carillion, there were more warnings, but eventually its accounts also proved to be wildly at odds with the reality of its financial position. Its demise led to calls for changes to how audits are conducted, and when the bakery chain went under, those calls became deafening. Several reviews of auditing and the audit profession were set in motion. The largest of these was the Kingman review, named after its chairman Sir John Kingman, the former Treasury mandarin who now chairs the FTSE 100 insurance and savings group Legal & General. He recommended the creation of a new regulator, which is due to become reality in two years' time. The big audit firms have also had to separate their audit arms from the rest of their accounting business - and look at proposals to share their work on the largest companies with smaller firms. The spokesperson for Grant Thornton said: ""We will continue to rigorously defend the civil claim brought by Patisserie Valerie's liquidators, which ignores the board's and management's own failings in detecting the sustained and collusive fraud which took place. ""We recognise that there were shortcomings in our audit work; however, our work did not cause the failure of the business.""

"Paul Kelly says the damage has already been done for the turkey business this Christmas Farmers are warning of a Christmas turkey shortage because visa changes to allow labour recruitment from abroad have come too late. A poultry association said big producers have already scaled back because they assumed they would not have enough staff to process birds. And turkey farmer Paul Kelly told the BBC the damage had already been done. The government has announced a visa scheme to allow 5,500 poultry workers into the UK on three-month contracts. As part of the changes, 5,000 HGV drivers will be allowed into the UK on similar contracts in an attempt to keep supermarket shelves stocked and petrol stations supplied with fuel. Kate Martin, chairwoman of the Traditional Farm Fresh Turkey Association, said: ""This year it's looking like there is a national shortage of turkeys when we're talking about supermarket shelves, rather than buying direct from your farm. ""It is the supermarket shelves that will be emptier of turkeys this year than they have been before, only because there have been less turkeys placed on the ground; only because the big processers know that they will not get them processed."" She said some members of her association had already seen a rise in orders, with one reportedly seeing a 400% increase on last year. No fuel shortage, says transport secretary Hauliers and poultry workers to get temporary visas Ms Martin said farms ""are now missing a whole host of their workforce that they have been training and investing in over the last however many years. Those workers are no longer available for us to use on a seasonal basis - they will go find work in mainland Europe instead."" Paul Kelly, who runs the KellyBronze farm, said the major producers were resigned to producing fewer birds for Christmas. ""The damage has already been done for the bigger processors because they have not put the turkeys on the farm,"" he said. Smaller producers, however, might be better prepared as they tended to recruit local labour rather than draft in large numbers of migrant staff, he added. One supermarket group told the BBC it was far too early to speculate about Christmas stocks. The British Poultry Council has estimated there are nearly 7,000 vacancies across the sector, leading some chicken producers to cut their output, and sparking shortages at restaurant chains Nando's and KFC. Mr Kelly said: ""There are chickens being killed on farms at the moment. There are pigs being shot in fields, because there are not enough people there to do the jobs."" A temporary visa scheme ""is definitely not an answer"" for the long term, he added. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said the package of visa measures would help the food and haulage industries cope in the run-up to Christmas. ""After a very difficult 18 months, I know how important this Christmas is for all of us and that's why we're taking these steps at the earliest opportunity to ensure preparations remain on track."" However, some business leaders said the measures did not go far enough, with the British Chambers of Commerce saying they were the equivalent of ""throwing a thimble of water on a bonfire"".

"Only 127 petrol tanker drivers from the EU have applied for temporary visas to help tackle the petrol crisis, according to the prime minister. The government is offering 300 short-term visas for overseas drivers. Meanwhile, military personnel have started driving fuel tankers to help resupply petrol stations. The Petrol Retailers Association (PRA) - which represents nearly 5,500 of the UK's 8,000 filling stations - says the worst-affected areas have seen a ""marginal"" improvement but still face a ""challenging"" time. It said about a fifth of forecourts in London and south-east England were out of fuel on Monday. But elsewhere in Britain, that figure was 8% and there had been a ""marked"" improvement, the association said. Last week the government said it would offertemporary visas for 5,000 overseas HGV drivers- including 300 immediate visas for tanker drivers. But Boris Johnson told BBC Breakfast that so faronly 127 European Union fuel drivers have appliedfor the scheme. He said the low number of applicants reflected a ""global"" issue causing ""a particular problem in the UK"". He blamed long-standing underinvestment in pay and driver facilities. Separately, about 200 Army and RAF personnel - including 100 drivers -will help deliver fuelto forecourts in the hardest-hit areas, including London and south-east England. They have been given training in safety procedures, equipment and forecourt driving manoeuvres. Other measures include: A suspension of competition law between oil firms, which the government said would make it easier for companies to share information and prioritise areas most in need The process for getting an HGV driver licence will be sped up,external, and nearly one million letters have been sent to existing HGV drivers to encourage them back into the industry, plus there are plans to train 4,000 others The doctors' body the BMA, the teachers' union NASUWT and some politicians including London Mayor Sadiq Khan wantedkey workers to be given priority accessto petrol stations to avoid disruption to essential services. However, the government hasn't announced plans to prioritise key workers as it didwith nursery and school places during the pandemic,external. Key workers struggling to travel amid fuel crisis The government has powers to limit how much fuel drivers can buy, and the hours when they can buy it, but hasn't used them so far. Some petrol stations have introduced a Â£30 cap on the amount of petrol people can buy. Petrol station worker: 'We're not trained for this' Driver 'pulls knife' during fuel dispute On 23 September,BP warned it would have to ""temporarily"" close a handful of its petrol stations, because of a lack of drivers. Long queues started to build up outside stations across Great Britain in the following days, amid fears that fuel might run out. Oil companies have stressed there is plenty of petrol available. However, the key issue is there aren't enough drivers to deliver it to forecourts. There's an estimated shortage of more than 100,000 HGV drivers, which has already caused problems for a range of retailers - from supermarkets to fast food chains. Fuel tanker driversneed additional safety qualifications,externalon top of their HGV licence to be able to transport chemicals such as petrol. There are a number of reasons - and many countries across Europe have been affected - but the UK has been especially badly hit. After Brexit, many European drivers returned to their home countries, or moved elsewhere, because working in the UK involved additional border bureaucracy which had an impact on their income. The pandemic saw even more drivers return to their home countries, with few coming back. Meanwhile, some older drivers have retired, and there's a huge backlog in HGV driver tests due to Covid. How serious is the HGV driver shortage? Petrol pricesare at an eight-year high,external. According to the latest weekly statistics, the average petrol price at UK forecourts on Monday was 136.1p a litre, up from 135.19p a week earlier. The price of a litre of diesel rose 137.95p to 139.2p over the same period. Simon Williams of the RAC said the increase was largely down to the rising price of oil rather than the recent supply problems.

"The pop star is known for hits like Murder On The Dancefloor and Groovejet Sophie Ellis-Bextor has spoken out about being raped at the age of 17 by an older musician. Writing in her new memoir, Spinning Plates, the singer says she lost her virginity in the incident at the apartment of a guitarist, who was 29. ""I heard myself saying 'No' and 'I don't want to,'"" she writes, ""but it didn't make any difference"". ""He had sex with me and I felt so ashamed. It was how I lost my virginity and I felt stupid."" She continued: ""I felt grubby, but also unsure about my own feelings as I had no other experience to compare it with."" In the book, which is being serialised in the Mail On Sunday, Ellis-Bextor describes how she met the musician - who she calls Jim - at a gig while she was studying for her A-Levels. He invited her back to his flat to see his history books ""and before I knew it we were on his bed and he took off my knickers"". The singer, who is now 42, says she was left confused following the incident as the public perception of rape in the 1990s ""was not to do with consent"" but rather ""something you associated with aggression"". ""But no one had pinned me down or shouted at me to make me comply,"" she says, adding that ""the things I saw and read and the way sex was discussed [at the time] made me believe I didn't have a case."" If you have been affected bysexual abuse or violence, help and support is available atBBC Action Line. According to Rape Crisis England and Wales, this perception still persists - with many victims believing they have no case if there are no physical signs of struggle or assault. The charity says there ""aremany reasons,externalwhy someone might not scream or struggle"". In fact, it says, ""quietness and stillness might suggest a lack of those crucial elements of freedom and capacity"". Misconceptions like these can make it difficult for survivors to seek help, with many fearing they will not be believed, it adds. Ellis-Bextor says she had decided to share her own experience to help people understand ""where the line between right and wrong lies"". ""My experience was not violent,"" she writes in her memoir. ""All that happened was I wasn't listened to. Of the two people there, one said yes, the other said no, and the yes person did it anyway. ""The older I've become, the more stark that 29-year-old man ignoring 17-year-old me has seemed."" As the mother of five sons, Ellis-Bextor says she had been careful to introduce them to the concept of consent. ""I want to raise considerate, kind people who can take other people's feelings into account,"" she writes. ""I want them to actively want the other person to be happy, too, rather than just stopping because they have to.""

"The government is to suspend competition law to allow oil firms to target fuel deliveries at petrol stations following recent panic buying. Officials said the move would make it easier for companies to share information and prioritise parts of the country most at need. It follows days of long queues at the pumps, after fears of disruption to the fuel supply sparked panic buying. But a minister said there were no plans to bring in the Army to drive tankers. The government has been considering using the Army, but Environment Secretary George Eustice said the shortage of drivers was ""not a huge problem"". ""The only reason we don't have petrol on forecourts is people are buying petrol when they don't need it,"" he said, predicting that things would ""calm down"" once anxious people had filled their cars. The Petrol Retailers Association has warned that as many as two-thirds of its membership of nearly 5,500 independent outlets are out of fuel, with the rest of them ""partly dry and running out soon"". The UK has a total of more than 8,000 filling stations. Announcing the measure to exempt the oil industry from the Competition Act 1998, Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng said the government had ""long-standing"" contingency plans to maintain fuel supplies. He said allowing the industry to share information would mean companies could work together more effectively to minimise disruption. The government alsorelaxed competition law in March 2020,external, to help supermarkets work together to maintain food supplies. How serious is the HGV driver shortage? 50,000 more lorry driver tests promised a year Temporary visa plan to ease lorry driver shortage Visas won't solve petrol supply issues - retailers A shortage of lorry drivers has caused problems for a range of industries in recent months, from supermarkets to fast food chains. In recent days, some fuel deliveries were affected, leading to panic buying and lengthy queues at some petrol stations. In a joint statement from companies including Shell, ExxonMobil and Greenergy, the industry reiterated that pressures on supply were being caused by ""temporary spikes in customer demand - not a national shortage of fuel"". PRA chairman Brian Madderson told the BBC the shortages were down to ""panic buying, pure and simple"", with oil companies prioritising keeping motorway service station pumps topped up. Pumps were mainly running dry in Britain's urban areas, while Northern Ireland was currently unaffected, he said. Queues began forming again outside this petrol station on Monday morning Mr Madderson also told BBC Radio 4's Today programme on Monday that filling stations were being restocked, but there were not enough deliveries to restore their normal levels of fuel. ""One of our members yesterday received a tanker at midday and by late afternoon the entire tanker had disappeared into people's cars,"" he said. On Saturday,the government announced it would offertemporary visas, lasting until Christmas Eve, to 5,000 foreign fuel tanker and food lorry drivers and 5,500 poultry workers in a bid to limit disruption in the build up to Christmas. Other measures include sending nearly one million letters to drivers who hold an HGV licence - to encourage them back into the industry - and plans to train 4,000 people to become HGV drivers. This video can not be played Grant Shapps: ""There is plenty of petrol in the country"" Elizabeth de Jong, director of policy for Logistics UK, told Today that it would be ""days, possibly a couple of weeks"" before the visa applications were open. She said the industry had wanted more visas to be available and for a longer time, but she said the key issue now was to make them attractive to drivers, which was likely to mean offering good wages. The UK had lost 72,000 drivers between the second quarter of 2019 and the same period in 2021, Ms de Jong said - partly due to people returning to the EU after Brexit. At the same time, she said the pandemic had disrupted testing for HGV licences, making it harder to replace the lost drivers. The DVLA said there were more than 54,000 applications for licences awaiting processing, although some of those may be renewals and drivers can continue to work while they are dealt with. The shortage of drivers and other workers is also causing concern in the food and retail industry. The British Retail Consortium said the number of visas being offered was ""too small"" to make an impact on the disruption expected at Christmas. Competition benefits consumers. It encourages firms to innovate and improve their offer to draw customers in. It can mean products are better, often at lower prices. It also aims to make sure firms compete on a level playing field, as well as protecting them from other businesses acting unfairly. It stops businesses from making agreements with each other that would distort competition, leaving customers worse off. Agreeing to fix prices for certain goods or services, limiting production to drive prices up, or carving up markets, for example, could all end up breaking competition law. That risks serious fines, people being banned from running companies, or even jail. During the pandemic, the government has intervened to exempt certain industries from elements of competition law. At the height of the coronavirus crisis, for example supermarkets were allowed to share more information with each other on stock levels and share depots and delivery vans, to meet customer demand. The latest move will allow fuel suppliers to share information on which locations are most in need and, according to the Petrol Retailers Association, possibly put fuel into their competitors' sites - which they would not typically be allowed to do. Andrew Opie, director of food and sustainability policy at the trade association, told the BBC: ""I think we're going to see less choice, less availability, possibly a shorter shelf life as well, which is really disappointing because this could have been averted."" Meanwhile, turkey farmer Kate Martin warnedsupermarkets could run out of poultry before Christmas. She said there were fewer turkeys being produced because the big processors ""know they will not get them processed"". But the boss of supermarket chain Aldi in the UK said he expected""business as usual"" at Christmas. Recruitment for additional short-term HGV drivers and poultry workers will begin in October, with the visas valid until Christmas Eve.

"Cars lined up for fuel in Stanwell, Surrey, but in many other places forecourts have shut after pumps ran dry Demand for petrol is expected to return to normal levels in the coming days, easing pressure on station forecourts, the fuel industry has said. In a joint statement, 10 companies, including BP and Shell, said there was plenty of fuel at refineries and urged people to buy it as they usually would. Earlier, the environment secretary said there were no plans at the moment to bring in the Army to drive tankers. But sources told the BBC that ministers are still seriously considering this. Meanwhile, doctors and home care staff have called for essential workers to be given priority for fuel. The Petrol Retailers Association, which represents nearly 5,500 of the UK's 8,000 filling stations, warned on Sunday that up to two-thirds of outlets were out of fuel, with the rest of them ""partly dry and running out soon"". But in a joint statement on Monday evening, a group of leading suppliers said: ""There is plenty of fuel at UK refineries and terminals, and as an industry we are working closely with the government to help ensure fuel is available to be delivered to stations across the country. ""As many cars are now holding more fuel than usual, we expect that demand will return to its normal levels in the coming days, easing pressures on fuel station forecourts."" Why are Britons panic-buying petrol? 'I'm at an Airbnb this week to avoid fuel queues' UK visa plan will not fix lorry crisis, says boss Police warning after 100 calls over fuel queues It comes after Environment Secretary George Eustice blamed queues at petrol stations and empty pumps on people buying fuel when they do not need it. He said the lack of HGV drivers would have been ""entirely manageable"" if it were not for the reaction to media coverage about a limited number of forecourt closures. ""Things will calm down. Those who are anxious - many of them will have filled up their cars with petrol now and things will then return to normal."" Mr Eustice said there were always civil contingency plans involving the Army but it was not thought necessary to call them in at the moment. Many in government are hoping this situation begins to resolve itself. They believe many people worried about shortages have already filled up their tanks - so the situation may start to die down. But if we continue to see queues at petrol stations there will be significant pressure for action. We know the new visas for HGV drivers aren't an overnight fix. So the option of sending the Army to drive tankers to forecourts is still being considered. A final decision on that has not been made. But if is does happen, extra training of armed forces personnel would be required. Ministers hope such action can be avoided. But the last few days have shown pleas for calm have not always been successful. Brian Madderson, chairman of the Petrol Retailers Association, said the industry had problems with a shortage of HGV drivers but it only became a ""critical situation"" when a submission by BP to the cabinet was leaked, sparking widespread coverage and panic buying. ""One of our members yesterday received a tanker at midday and by late afternoon the entire tanker had disappeared into people's cars,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. Mr Madderson said that customers themselves could solve the problem of pumps running dry. ""If they start buying in their normal quantities, Â£20 worth, 20 litres to fill up every week, we could see by the end of this week some return to normality - it won't be perfect, but some return,"" he said. This video can not be played Key workers and essential trips affected by panic buying Meanwhile, the lack of fuel in some forecourts has led to calls from the British Medical Association, the Royal College of Nursing and the UK Homecare Association for healthcare staff and essential workers to be given priority access. BMA chairman Dr Chaand Nagpaul said: ""As pumps run dry there is a real risk that NHS staff won't be able to do their jobs and provide vital services and care to people who urgently need it."" The UK Homecare Association said people had been left waiting for carers at home because staff have been caught in queues for petrol. Ambulances have their own fuel pumps in their depots and their supplies are expected to be prioritised, however.

"This video can not be played Labourâs shadow chancellor says she would invest in ""good jobs in the green industries of the future"" Labour has promised to spend an extra Â£28bn a year on making the UK economy more ""green"" if it wins power. Shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves said the money would go on offshore wind farms, planting trees and developing batteries. In her speech to Labour's annual conference in Brighton, she also pledged to phase out business rates to help the Covid-damaged High Street. And she said giant tech firms would pay more tax in future. An aide to Ms Reeves told the BBC the Â£28bn would come from government borrowing and the investment should ""have a positive impact"" on the wider economy. Labour backs Starmer over party rules reforms Labour needs policies now, says Burnham Rayner renews attack on Johnson in scum row In her speech, Ms Reeves said: ""I will be a responsible chancellor. I will be Britain's first green chancellor."" She added: ""I will invest in good jobs in the green industries of the future, giga-factories to build batteries for electric vehicles, a thriving hydrogen industry, offshore wind with turbines made in Britain, planting trees and building flood defences, keeping homes warm and getting energy bills down, good new jobs in communities throughout Britain."" Rachel Reeves is the shadow chancellor with something for everyone. For the Labour Party activists crying out for ambitious pledges following a series of lukewarm announcements there was Â£28bn a year of investment to help the UK reach its climate targets. She also went after some of the most potent symbols for party members: private schools and Jeff Bezos, the founder of Amazon (""if you can afford to fly to the moon, you can afford to pay your taxes here on earth!"") For the business community there was a promise to axe business rates and replace the Â£30bn of revenue withâ¦ something. For those who thought it was all a bit too much she unveiled some fiscal rules that could lightly limit her room to spend and borrow, and a new value for money ""hit squad"" that would scrutinise government spending. She has also upped her speech game significantly, introducing a group of keyworkers in the front row to rapturous applause and lowering her voice dramatically to deliver her soundbites. Ms Reeves said the annual Â£28bn investment - which would continue until 2030 - would help ""protect our planet for future generations"". It would include the Â£3bn shadow business secretary Ed Miliband promised to help make the UK steel industry carbon-neutral in his conference speech on Sunday. Labour is expected to make a series of announcements on where the rest of the money would go. Greenpeace UK welcomed the overall spending pledge, with its head of politics, Rebecca Newsom, saying: ""Tackling the climate crisis has to be at the heart of what the Treasury does."" The independent Climate Change Committee estimates the cost of making the UK carbon-neutral will bebetween 1% and 2% of GDP,externaluntil 2050. Based on last year's figures, that would equate to between Â£19.6bn and Â£39.2bn a year. During her half-hour speech, Ms Reeves said a Labour government would freeze business rates in England until 2023 and make rates relief for smaller firms more generous. It would eventually scrap rates completely, she said, replacing them with a new ""modern"" business tax, which the party is yet to define. Labour is also proposing a new tax on commercial property. And it is proposing to increase the digital services tax - paid by search engines and social media firms - from 2% to 12%, when it is replaced by a higher global corporation tax rate agreed as part of aninternational scheme. Ms Reeves told the conference the party would bring in the ""biggest overhaul of business taxation in a generation"", allowing businesses to ""lead the pack, not watch opportunities go elsewhere."" She announced plans to scrap ""hundreds"" of tax breaks and set up an Office of Value for Money, which aides describe as a ""hit squad"" to scrutinise government spending and ensure tax is used wisely. Ms Reeves said a Labour government would tell firms which have received contracts to deal with the Covid pandemic but under-delivered to repay the money given to them by the government. ""We will set up a team to go through every line of every failed contract where value was not delivered, and claw back every penny of taxpayers' money we possibly can,"" she added, ""because that money belongs in our police, it belongs in our schools and it belongs in our NHS."" The policies announced by Ms Reeves were welcomed by the Federation for Small Businesses, whose national chair Mike Cherry said: ""The shadow chancellor is right to propose concrete reform of a business rates tax which disproportionately burdens the small businesses and sole traders at the heart of local communities."" But Conservative Party co-chairman Oliver Dowden said: ""Successive Labour leaders have threatened businesses with tax hikes, higher bills, and more red tape. ""Only the Conservatives can be trusted to support our businesses and help our economy thrive as we build back better.""

For the business community there was a promise to axe business rates and replace the Â£30bn of revenue withâ¦ something. For those who thought it was all a bit too much she unveiled some fiscal rules that could lightly limit her room to spend and borrow, and a new value for money ""hit squad"" that would scrutinise government spending. She has also upped her speech game significantly, introducing a group of keyworkers in the front row to rapturous applause and lowering her voice dramatically to deliver her soundbites. Ms Reeves said the annual Â£28bn investment - which would continue until 2030 - would help ""protect our planet for future generations"". It would include the Â£3bn shadow business secretary Ed Miliband promised to help make the UK steel industry carbon-neutral in his conference speech on Sunday. Labour is expected to make a series of announcements on where the rest of the money would go. Greenpeace UK welcomed the overall spending pledge, with its head of politics, Rebecca Newsom, saying: ""Tackling the climate crisis has to be at the heart of what the Treasury does."" The independent Climate Change Committee estimates the cost of making the UK carbon-neutral will bebetween 1% and 2% of GDP,externaluntil 2050. Based on last year's figures, that would equate to between Â£19.6bn and Â£39.2bn a year. During her half-hour speech, Ms Reeves said a Labour government would freeze business rates in England until 2023 and make rates relief for smaller firms more generous. It would eventually scrap rates completely, she said, replacing them with a new ""modern"" business tax, which the party is yet to define. Labour is also proposing a new tax on commercial property. And it is proposing to increase the digital services tax - paid by search engines and social media firms - from 2% to 12%, when it is replaced by a higher global corporation tax rate agreed as part of aninternational scheme. Ms Reeves told the conference the party would bring in the ""biggest overhaul of business taxation in a generation"", allowing businesses to ""lead the pack, not watch opportunities go elsewhere."" She announced plans to scrap ""hundreds"" of tax breaks and set up an Office of Value for Money, which aides describe as a ""hit squad"" to scrutinise government spending and ensure tax is used wisely. Ms Reeves said a Labour government would tell firms which have received contracts to deal with the Covid pandemic but under-delivered to repay the money given to them by the government. ""We will set up a team to go through every line of every failed contract where value was not delivered, and claw back every penny of taxpayers' money we possibly can,"" she added, ""because that money belongs in our police, it belongs in our schools and it belongs in our NHS."" The policies announced by Ms Reeves were welcomed by the Federation for Small Businesses, whose national chair Mike Cherry said: ""The shadow chancellor is right to propose concrete reform of a business rates tax which disproportionately burdens the small businesses and sole traders at the heart of local communities."" But Conservative Party co-chairman Oliver Dowden said: ""Successive Labour leaders have threatened businesses with tax hikes, higher bills, and more red tape. ""Only the Conservatives can be trusted to support our businesses and help our economy thrive as we build back better.""

"There have been several protests around the M25 in the past two weeks Climate change protesters have defied a court order and blocked part of the M25 at Heathrow Airport. A total of 53 people have been arrested as Insulate Britain blocked the slip road at junction 14 just after 08:00 BST. The road has now reopened. A High Court injunctionbanning protests around the M25 and Dartford Crossing was issued last Thursday. ""You can throw as many injunctions at us as you like, but we are going nowhere,"" the campaign group said. Police have arrested 53 people Ministers had hoped the High Court injunction would prevent further disruption around London It is the latest of several protests targeting major roads in the south east. The order, which was granted to National Highways Ltd, states demonstrators are banned from ""causing damage to the surface of or to any apparatus on or around the M25 including but not limited to painting, damaging by fire, or affixing any item or structure thereto"". The blocked junction has since fully reopened It adds that those involved ""may be held to be in contempt of court and may be imprisoned, fined or have their assets seized."" The injunction includes slip roads and bridges. Ministers had hoped the High Court injunction would prevent further disruption around London. In statements read out last week at the Home Office, the campaigners said: ""We are more scared of the destruction of our country than we are of breaking an injunction. ""There are times when we have to step up and do what is right."" The group, an offshoot of Extinction Rebellion, is calling for the government to insulate homes in the UK to help cut carbon emissions. It wants heat-saving measures installed in social housing by 2025 and all homes by 2030. Protesters were dragged away from the protest Protester Dr Diana Warner, 62, a retired GP from Bristol, said she was protesting out of ""desperation"". ""This is the fifth time I've been here trying to block a motorway because the only way to get the government to listen is to disrupt things,"" she said. Ms Warner added she ""completely understood"" people's frustrations with the protest however what was at risk was the ""lives of our children and grandchildren"". ""I'm really sorry but I'm determined to do everything I can to make us safe and change society ... we have to try."" The government said it was investing Â£1.3bn to support people to install energy efficiency measures.

"This video can not be played A church in the village of Arkalochori was reduced to a pile of rubble At least one person has been killed and several injured after a 5.8-magnitude earthquake hit the Greek island of Crete, local officials say. The man died when the dome of a church that was being renovated in the town of Arkalochori caved in. People were sent rushing out on to the streets when the earthquake struck at 09:17 (06:17 GMT). Many buildings were damaged and some reduced to piles of rubble from the initial quake and strong aftershocks. People who live in damaged, older buildings are being advised to stay outdoors. Some 2,500 tents were set up to house those who could not safely return to their homes on Monday, government minister Christos Stylianidis told Greece's Ant1 news. He also declared a state of emergency in the Heraklion region - where Arkalochori is located. British woman Millie Mackay and her nine-year-old daughter Eleni are on holiday in Crete and were in their ground floor hotel room when the earthquake hit. ""Glasses started smashing so we ran outside by the pool,"" Ms Mackay told the BBC. ""There the bosses guided us to a place of safety... [The manager] was then calling out room numbers and checking if everyone was out and OK."" Local resident Evangelia Christaki told AFP news agency that she had just enough time to grab her husband, who has a disability, and run outside as her house shook. ""Fortunately, our home was not too badly damaged,"" she said. ""But the authorities have told us to stay outdoors over the next hours. In any case, we are so scared."" The small farming town of Arkalochori, located about 30km (18 miles) from the island's capital Heraklion, was particularly badly hit by the earthquake. Pictures from the area show damaged shop fronts and crumbled buildings. Local media is reporting that safety inspections are now under way, with members of Greece's disaster response unit flown in with sniffer dogs and specialised rescue equipment. Rescuers searched through the rubble of the demolished church in Arkalochori ""This is not an event that occurred without warning,"" seismologist Gerasimos Papadopoulos said on Greece's state broadcaster, ERT. ""We have seen activity in this region for several months. This was a strong earthquake, it was not under sea but under land and affecting populated areas,"" he added. The European Mediterranean Seismological Centre (EMSC) initially recorded a magnitude of 6.5 while the United States Geological Survey (USGS) put it at 6.0. The Athens Geodynamic Institute later said the 5.8 quake struck 23km (14 miles) north-west of the coastal village of Arvi, at a depth of 10km. Both Greece and Turkey sit on fault lines and earthquakes are common. Have you been affected by the earthquake?

"Another 37,960 cases of coronavirus are recorded in the UK - the highest figure for two and a half weeks And another 40 people have died in the UK within 28 days of a positive test A Labour government would claw back money from failed Covid contracts, Shadow Chancellor Rachel Reeves tells the party's conference New South Wales, home to Sydney, announces its roadmap out of lockdown - restrictions will ease when the vaccination rate hits 70% Online applications for Northern Ireland's Â£100 high street voucher scheme - to help businesses recover from the pandemic - have opened Letters offering Covid vaccination appointments are now being sent out to 12 to 15-year-olds in Scotland Patients in Wales have been warned it could take years to clear the NHS waiting list backlog Edited by James Clarke That's all from the live page team, we hope you have a good evening. We'll be back with more tomorrow. Your updates were written by Emma Harrison, Jennifer Meierhans and Lauren Turner. The page was edited by James Clarke and Chris Lansdown. We are going to be bringing the live page to a close soon so here's a recap of the day's coronavirus developments: People queue for a coronavirus vaccine in Egyptian capital Cairo Earlier today we heard that Wales is to merge the green and amber country lists, joining England which had already announced it was going to do so from 4 October. The red list - for countries considered highest risk - will remain, with arrivals still needing to pay for a quarantine hotel. The change means fully vaccinated travellersarriving from non-red list countries,externalwill no longer have to take a PCR or lateral flow test before they set off for the UK. This includes people vaccinatedin the UK, the EU, the US or 18 other recognised countries,external. Travellers will still have to take a PCR test two days after arrival. People who are not fully vaccinated willstill need a pre-departure test and a PCR test,externalon days two and eight after they return. They must also self-isolate for 10 days. Test to Release,externalwill remain an option for unvaccinated passengers to England who want to shorten quarantine. But what else is changing and which tests do you need for going on holiday? We've got an explainerherewith all the information you might need if you are going away. Phil McCannBBC News I told you earlier about some of the Covid survivors I met at the the Royal Preston Hospital. Here's the moment an emotional Jean told me she believes the vaccine saved her life. This video can not be played The furlough scheme, which protected millions of jobs during the pandemic, is being wound up at later this week, at the end of September From March 2020 to the end of this month, the cost of furlough will come to about Â£66bn, according to estimates from the Office for Budget Responsibility. That's a huge sum, about one fifth of the money the government has spent on the response to Covid. The government says it has supported 11.6 million jobs in that time. With it coming to an end, many forecasters, including the Bank of England, are expecting a small rise in unemployment after furlough ends. That's because some employers with workers on furlough may find they cannot afford to keep them on when furlough ends. International travel - and other businesses which depend on it, are still seriously disrupted. Some furloughed workers in these areas may lose their jobs. You can read more on furloughhere. Let's take a look at what the daily figures tell us about the coronavirus situation in the UK today. Case numbers are still high with another 37,960 new infections in today's data. But deaths are steadying with another 40 reported. Some schools in Cumbria have asked pupils to wear face masks again because of rising Covid-19 cases in the area. Health bosses are now reviewing whether to introduce the move across the whole county - despite it not being required under England's national guidelines. County public health director Colin Cox said Cumbria was seeing the highest levels ever but only among children and young people. Schools in west Cumbria have seen the most ""significant outbreaks"", Cox says. Last week some secondary schools saw 4,000 coronavirus cases per 100,000 in the Allerdale council area. And it was announced last week that siblings of positive children in the county were being told to isolate to try to reduce infection rates. The pupils were told they should also take a PCR test before returning to school. Read more here. NI's largest Covid-19 vaccination centre opened at the Odyssey SSE Arena in Belfast in March 2021 As we are reporting, the UK has fully-vaccinated more than two thirds of the entire population, but take-up of the jab continues to vary by country, according to analysis by the PA news agency. While Scotland and Wales have both managed to give two doses of vaccine to 70% of their respective populations, the equivalent figure for Northern Ireland is just over 63%. In England the figure currently stands at just under two-thirds. There is also wide variation among age groups. At least 95% of people in Scotland in all groups aged 55 and over have had both doses, but in Wales this threshold has been reached just for groups aged 70 and over. In England it has been reached only for people aged 60 to 64 and 70 to 79. Northern Ireland reports its vaccination uptake in larger age groups, with the latest data suggesting two doses have been given to more than 95% of people aged 60-69, 70-79 and 80 and over. The UK has joined a handful of countries to have fully vaccinated more than two-thirds of its entire population against Covid-19. More than 44.7 million second doses have now been delivered in the UK, according to government figures - the equivalent of just over 66.6% of the total population. Other countries to have already passed this figure include Canada, with at least 70% of people fully vaccinated, Chile at 73% and Singapore at 76%. A number of European nations have also beaten the UK to the milestone of two-thirds fully jabbed, such as Italy with 67%, Belgium at 71%, Ireland with 73% and Spain at 77%. Portugal continues to lead the world, however, with at least 84% of its total population having now received two doses of the vaccine. Figures for other countries have been compiled by Our World in Data using the latest official information from governments and health ministries. Covid vaccines: How fast is progress around the world? The UK has fully vaccinated more than two thirds of its population but, as more people are fully-jabbed, the rate of vaccinations is slowing The UK has given a total of 93,500,858 coronavirus vaccinations. That's 48,736,534 first doses and 44,764,324 second doses. Here's how the UK's vaccine rollout is goingin charts. There have been a further 40 coronavirus-related deaths in the UK,according to the government's daily statistics.,external And 37,960 new infections have also been recorded - that's the highest figure since 9 September. The town with England's highest rate of Covid infections has seen its figure nearly double within a week. Kettering, in Northamptonshire, saw 900 cases per 100,000 people in the week to 22 September. The number rose sharply among secondary school-aged pupils, which officials say accounts for most cases. The county's joint director of public health Lucy Wightman is urging people to ""continue to play their part in preventing further spread"". Parents and students have been asked to test themselves twice a week. Officials say secondary school children suspected of having the virusshould not go in until they have had a negative PCR test. Scottish Labour has reported the Test and Protect system's data on coronavirus contact tracing times to the UK's statistics watchdog. It follows a report that official figures did not include ""failed"" contact tracing attempts - where the Test and Protect team were not able to reach positive cases by phone. The Scottish Sun reported there had been more than 50,000 such failed cases in a year, making up about 10% of all Test and Protect cases. The newspaper says these failed cases were not included in the weekly figures published by Public Health Scotland (PHS), which are used to determine if the system is meeting the international standard of the World Health Organization (WHO). The target is for 80% of cases to have their close contacts traced and quarantined within 72 hours of the case being confirmed. The Scottish Government says it is confident in its interpretation of the PHS data and how it relates to the WHO standard. A spokesman for the UK Statistics Authority confirms it has received a complaint from Scottish Labour's health spokeswoman Jackie Baillie. These people are all in masks - but never wearing one in enclosed spaces raises the chances of testing positive, the survey found The Office for National Statistics (ONS)has released its latest report,externalon who is most likely to be testing positive for coronavirus at the moment. The dates it looked at were the fortnight ending 11 September, and it covers all of the UK. It found that people who had received at least one dose of a coronavirus vaccine were less likely to test positive for coronavirus. And those more likely to record a positive test included:  The data comes from people taking part in the ONS coronavirus infection survey - a large household monitoring survey that looks at infection within the community. It excludes those in hospitals, care homes and other institutional settings.  Patience AtuhaireBBC News, Kampala Uganda is ramping up vaccination of priority populations A study by Ugandan scientists has found vaccination against
Covid-19 significantly reduced deaths in the country. There were no deaths recorded among fully vaccinated patients during the research period. There were also fewer deaths among those who were partially vaccinated. The study, conducted between May and July this year, used data collected
from 1,462 patients admitted at two of the largest Covid-19 treatment centres in the capital, Kampala. Some were fully vaccinated while others had only received their first
dose of AstraZeneca, which was the only vaccine available in the country
then. The researchers from Makerere University, working under the
institutionâs Research and Innovation and Fund, also found vaccinated
patients were 45% less likely to die during hospitalisation. It was done during a period when Covid infections threatened to
overwhelm the health system, as the country suffered its second wave. The study is being published at a time when Uganda is ramping up
vaccination of priority populations. From Monday, teachers and students above 18 years will be offered a vaccine as the government targets a phased reopening of the
education sector starting in November. Uganda has recorded a total of 3,146 Covid-19 deaths since the pandemic
begun. Nearly two million vaccine jabs have so far been given out countrywide.

Online applications can now be made for Â£100 high street vouchers to spend in places like clothing retailers and hospitality venues before the end of November. Read more Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent The fuel supply problemsin parts of the UK have an impact on the NHS like the rest
of society. Ambulance services have their own fuel pumps at their depots
so there is no immediate risk that a crew in need of fuel should not be able to
fill up their tanks today. Those in-house pumps will need restocking at some point and
clearly ambulance services will be prioritised for supplies. There is â as one service put it â no realistic scenario
where ambulances run out of fuel. But the bigger concern is for staff who are travelling
around in their own vehicles, either to get to work or to see patients in the
community. Nearly all are reliant on using public petrol stations.
Already the UK Homecare Association has raised concern that the service
provided by carers in peopleâs homes has been disrupted with staff running out
of petrol and caught in queues, ending up late for calls. The association, along with others like the British Medical
Association, are calling for health and care staff to be prioritised for fuel. During previous fuel shortages councils have arranged
systems to ensure essential workers are able to fill up their cars. The message coming from a number of health and care bodies
is that this must be brought in and quickly.  Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst Zhong Nanshan is China's answer to Chris Whitty, England's chief medical officer Cases of Covid-19 persist in two Chinese provinces, and are threatening peopleâs plans for an upcoming national holiday. Golden Week - from 1-7 October - is fast approaching, the second biggest travel period in China after the Lunar New Year. This year, 650 million Chinese are expected totravel for the festivities,external. The holiday begins with Chinaâs National Day, and Chinaâs answer to Chris Whitty, Zhong Nanshan, has this year sung a songto mark the country's ""birthday"".,external However, cases of Covid-19 are still being identified daily in two Chinese provinces: northeast Heilongjiang and southeast Fujian province. The Ministry of Culture and Tourism earlier warned that travel companies might have to âimmediately suspend trans-provincial group tours, air tickets and hotel reservation servicesâif these regions canât drop their daily cases to zero.,external There have been more than 400 cases confirmed in Fujian in recent weeks.  But the South China Morning Post newspapernotes today that cases have eased in the province,external. However, the national Global Times newspaper says that in Heilongjiang, cases have spread beyond Harbin,the one city where the virus had been identified,external. Both regions are discouraging residents against travelling and are rolling out mass testing drives to identify symptomatic and asymptomatic people. As we've heard today, letters offering Covid vaccination appointments are beingsent out to 12 to 15-year-oldsin Scotland. Every child in this age group in the UK is now being offered a single vaccination dose. InScotland, as well as being invited to book an appointment at a clinic, 12 to 15-year-olds can get vaccinated at drop-in centres. InEnglandandNorthern Ireland,the programme is mostly based in schools. And inWales, vaccination centres are being used, withdifferent arrangements in place between areas. It is hoped the measure will help prevent further disruption to their education. Vaccinating children should help keep cases down, although it won't stop the spread of Covid in schools. Evidence suggests a single jab cuts the risk of catching the Delta variant by about 55%. It also reduces the chances of getting very sick or spreading it to someone else. Read more in our explainer here A Labour government would claw back money from failed Covid contracts, the shadow chancellor has told the party's conference. Speaking in Brighton, Rachel Reeves criticised the government for awarding contracts to ""friends and donors"" of the Conservative Party during the pandemic, saying: ""Let's review some of the highlights of the Tories' pandemic outsourcing bonanza. ""Â£90m to one business which had donated Â£400,000 to the Conservative Party, not a bad return on their investment. Â£150m to a financial services firm to produce 50 million facemasks that couldn't be used! ""Â£350m to a company employing a sitting Tory MP, for test kits which had to be recalled. Â£30m to Matt Hancock's pub landlord. And every single one of those cheques signed by Rishi Sunak."" ""To those who have secured Covid contracts and have not delivered. I give you notice. We expect that money back,"" she tells the delegates. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking.",Negative,0.112466566
"This video can not be played Labourâs shadow chancellor says she would invest in ""good jobs in the green industries of the future"" Labour has promised to spend an extra Â£28bn a year on making the UK economy more ""green"" if it wins power. Shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves said the money would go on offshore wind farms, planting trees and developing batteries. In her speech to Labour's annual conference in Brighton, she also pledged to phase out business rates to help the Covid-damaged High Street. And she said giant tech firms would pay more tax in future. An aide to Ms Reeves told the BBC the Â£28bn would come from government borrowing and the investment should ""have a positive impact"" on the wider economy. Labour backs Starmer over party rules reforms Labour needs policies now, says Burnham Rayner renews attack on Johnson in scum row In her speech, Ms Reeves said: ""I will be a responsible chancellor. I will be Britain's first green chancellor."" She added: ""I will invest in good jobs in the green industries of the future, giga-factories to build batteries for electric vehicles, a thriving hydrogen industry, offshore wind with turbines made in Britain, planting trees and building flood defences, keeping homes warm and getting energy bills down, good new jobs in communities throughout Britain."" Rachel Reeves is the shadow chancellor with something for everyone. For the Labour Party activists crying out for ambitious pledges following a series of lukewarm announcements there was Â£28bn a year of investment to help the UK reach its climate targets. She also went after some of the most potent symbols for party members: private schools and Jeff Bezos, the founder of Amazon (""if you can afford to fly to the moon, you can afford to pay your taxes here on earth!"") For the business community there was a promise to axe business rates and replace the Â£30bn of revenue withâ¦ something. For those who thought it was all a bit too much she unveiled some fiscal rules that could lightly limit her room to spend and borrow, and a new value for money ""hit squad"" that would scrutinise government spending. She has also upped her speech game significantly, introducing a group of keyworkers in the front row to rapturous applause and lowering her voice dramatically to deliver her soundbites. Ms Reeves said the annual Â£28bn investment - which would continue until 2030 - would help ""protect our planet for future generations"". It would include the Â£3bn shadow business secretary Ed Miliband promised to help make the UK steel industry carbon-neutral in his conference speech on Sunday. Labour is expected to make a series of announcements on where the rest of the money would go. Greenpeace UK welcomed the overall spending pledge, with its head of politics, Rebecca Newsom, saying: ""Tackling the climate crisis has to be at the heart of what the Treasury does."" The independent Climate Change Committee estimates the cost of making the UK carbon-neutral will bebetween 1% and 2% of GDP,externaluntil 2050. Based on last year's figures, that would equate to between Â£19.6bn and Â£39.2bn a year. During her half-hour speech, Ms Reeves said a Labour government would freeze business rates in England until 2023 and make rates relief for smaller firms more generous. It would eventually scrap rates completely, she said, replacing them with a new ""modern"" business tax, which the party is yet to define. Labour is also proposing a new tax on commercial property. And it is proposing to increase the digital services tax - paid by search engines and social media firms - from 2% to 12%, when it is replaced by a higher global corporation tax rate agreed as part of aninternational scheme. Ms Reeves told the conference the party would bring in the ""biggest overhaul of business taxation in a generation"", allowing businesses to ""lead the pack, not watch opportunities go elsewhere."" She announced plans to scrap ""hundreds"" of tax breaks and set up an Office of Value for Money, which aides describe as a ""hit squad"" to scrutinise government spending and ensure tax is used wisely. Ms Reeves said a Labour government would tell firms which have received contracts to deal with the Covid pandemic but under-delivered to repay the money given to them by the government. ""We will set up a team to go through every line of every failed contract where value was not delivered, and claw back every penny of taxpayers' money we possibly can,"" she added, ""because that money belongs in our police, it belongs in our schools and it belongs in our NHS."" The policies announced by Ms Reeves were welcomed by the Federation for Small Businesses, whose national chair Mike Cherry said: ""The shadow chancellor is right to propose concrete reform of a business rates tax which disproportionately burdens the small businesses and sole traders at the heart of local communities."" But Conservative Party co-chairman Oliver Dowden said: ""Successive Labour leaders have threatened businesses with tax hikes, higher bills, and more red tape.

"This video can not be played Dilys Hughes says the service station had to close to make sure local people were not hit by the rush NHS patients could be affected if nurses and other medical staff are unable to get fuel, a union has warned. Some nurses had faced aggression when trying to identify themselves as key workers at stations, said Diane Powles, of the Royal College of Nursing (RCN). She called for key workers to be given priority over fuel, and urged people to act responsibly. A Petrol Retailers Association (PRA) poll showed half of its UK stations ""were dry"" over the weekend. The UK environment secretary has saidpeople buying fuel when they do not need it are the cause of queues at petrol stations and empty pumps. Nurses and other medical key workers need priority status for fuel, says Diane Powles, from the Royal College of Nursing Wales Ms Powles, associate director for nursing policy and practise at RCN Wales, said clinical staff have had to prioritise care, and it would have affected people trying to get to work in the hospitals. But she said it would have a greater impact on staff working in the communities such as district nurses, health visitors and midwives. She said: ""We have had some stories of nurses having difficulties to access fuel, and that there has been a lot of altercations at the petrol pump as they try to identify themselves as key workers. ""If this continues into the next few days, it will start to have an impact on patient care - getting to work will prove more challenging for community nurses, midwives and for home visits. ""During the pandemic, key workers were given priority status for shopping and ideally they should have this for petrol stations to allow them to be prioritised. ""The public need to have a think: Do you really need to make that journey because that could stop somebody getting a nurse?"" Several petrol stations shut amid panic buying The pilot helping plug the lorry driver shortage No need for chaos at fuel stations, says boss The UK government has announced it plans tointroduce temporary work visas for foreign lorry driversto ease problems. It is alsosuspending competition lawto allow oil companies to work together to get fuel to forecourts. Oil 4 Wales director, Colin Owens, said its garage in Maesteg usually sells between 20,000 and 30,000 litres of fuel, but in the last 24 hours alone, has gone through 100,000. He described the queues as ""carnage"" and said suppliers are working ""flat out"" after people have been panic buying fuel ""all night"". Mr Owens said the company's oil supplier has ""never let us down"" and ""our tanks are full"", adding: ""I promise you the garages will balance out again and everyone will be served."" Rock band The Charlatans asked on Twitter where they could find fuel in Cardiff Tim Burgess of rock band The Charlatans asked his 255,000 Twitter followers where his band could find fuel in Cardiff to allow them to continue touring. He has since tweeted that they had found enough fuel to continue on to Nottingham after Monday night's gig in the Welsh capital. Allow Twitter content?

One dad from Swansea said the shortage was affecting his children's education. Adam told BBC Radio Wales: ""We'd lost the credit card last week, by the time the new one come through at the weekend the panic buying had hit. ""We had no fuel in the car and we actually had to get out of the car and walk home. So that means the kids haven't gone to school. ""We live near Ammanford and my children's school is up in Pontardawe (10.6 miles or 17 km), so it is a commute in itself, you know. ""If someone has fuel in their tank then they should go home. If they haven't got any at all then of course they're gonna need to queue and they're there for their own reasons, but just be respectful of other people."" Several supermarkets closed petrol stations in Wales due to demand for fuel over the weekend A petrol station in Gwynedd said it had received calls from people in Birmingham, more than 90 miles away, asking if it had any petrol. The Mallwyd service station had so many calls from far away that it closed on Sunday to preserve fuel supplies for locals. Dilys Hughes, who works at the station, said it had been ""manic"" on Friday, with motorists coming from ""everywhere"". She said she was just about to run out of petrol, but there would be no problem if drivers bought fuel as they normally would. She added: ""I might, the way I'm feeling, close today as well."" How serious is the HGV driver shortage? Very little benefit to HGV visa plan, haulier says Andrew Johnson, who runs Dafarn Newydd Store and fuel station in the village of Llanwyddyn, in Powys, has had to ration fuel to just Â£10 per customer. ""We've probably done as much fuel over the weekend as we have over the last five days,"" he said. Some people living in rural areas are struggling for fuel, one petrol station owner says He toldBBC Radio Walespeople were calling from up to 24 miles away asking how much fuel the store had left, which he described as ""unheard of"". ""We've only got 2,000 litre tanks, people have arrived and they've all just said 'we'll take what we're given'."" But he now only has enough fuel to last the store a day-and-a-half and, without a delivery, will have to close. Lloyd Kidby, director at S&K Haulage based in Barry, Vale of Glamorgan, said the business had not been affected by fuel shortages at petrol stations because it bought its own fuel in bulk which is delivered to the depot. However, a number of their drivers travel to them from places including the Midlands and Cornwall. He said he was a few drivers short on Monday because those living further than 50 miles away have not been able to put enough petrol in their cars to travel to south Wales to pick up their lorry. Essentially, he said, it was a problem affecting people getting to work in the first place rather than an issue for the lorries. This video can not be played People should carry on buying petrol as normal, the UK government says On Saturday, UK government ministers announced they are looking to issue about 5,000 temporary visas for foreign lorry drivers to help with the lack of fuel and other products. But any changes to immigration rules will be short-term, with a cap on the number of workers allowed to enter the UK. National Farmers Union (NFU) Cymru has written to the prime minister and Wales' secretary of state asking the government to consider getting access to migrant labour. ""If we have got a need in this country and there is an opportunity to fill it by looking to migrant labour from Europe, then I really think we need to drop those barriers,"" said Abi Reader, a farmer in Wenove, Vale of Glamorgan. Abi Reader, also chair of NFU Cymru, says farmers living in less urban areas are starting to get ""a bit tight"" on fuel Minister blames empty fuel pumps on excess buying Hauliers and poultry workers to get temporary visas She said she is concerned staff will not have enough fuel to get to work and make deliveries. ""I'm astonished at how much we do rely on it [fuel], we've got various animals in because they're close to calfing, we need to be able to keep their areas clean - that needs machinery - and we are going to need full tanks of fuel everyday for them. ""This is also a significant month for planting, and a lot of our contractors will be relying on full tanks of food to make sure they can get out to the fields and get next years food crop in, so I'm a little bit tense about it."" Pausing competition law means the government should be able to get more tankers to struggling areas The transport secretary previously told people to carry on as normal but amid panic buying, Steve Coombe, of PRA, which represent nearly 3,000 independent fuelling stations, said it is illegal to take more than 30 litres of fuel in any container. In a straw poll of its members, he said retailers had reported between a 350% and 500% uplift in volume due to panic buying over the weekend. But he said there ""is variance"" throughout the country, with some deliveries being made with ""no issue"" and expects to see improvements by later this week.

"Australia's prime minister has signalled he may not attend the UN's landmark climate conference in November as his government faces continued criticism of its poor climate record. In an interview, Scott Morrison said he had ""not made any final decisions"" on attending, suggesting it was a burden. ""It's another trip overseas... and I've spent a lot of time in quarantine,"" he told the West Australian newspaper. The COP26 summit will be the biggest global climate crisis talks in years. It is hoped that the 12-day meeting between world leaders in Glasgow, Scotland will produce the next emissions standards to slow global warming and keep temperature rise below 1.5C. But Mr Morrison said he would consider other priorities, including the reopening of Australia's borders. ""I have to focus on things here and with Covid. Australia will be opening up around that time. There will be a lot of issues to manage and I have to manage those competing demands,""he told the newspaper,external. Australia recently approved a coal mine expansion south of Sydney despite global calls for coal projects to come to an end Australia - one of the world's top exporters of coal and gas - is one of 200 countries expected to present their updated 2030 emissions cuts at the meet. Mr Morrison has said he wishes Australia to achieve net zero emissions ""as soon as possible"", but has not outlined any measures to do so. His government has resisted committing to net zero by 2050 - a goal already pledged by the US, the UK and many other developed nations. Australia has consistently been criticised for its slow climate progress and heavy reliance on coal-fired power - which makes it the most carbon polluting nation in the world per capita. What needs to be agreed to stop climate change? Australia attacks EU climate plan to tax imports Climate action is still hotly contested in Australia Canberra is also staunchly protective of its fossil fuel industry - and has pledged to continue mining and trading dirty fuels as long as there is demand in Asia. In July, a UN report ranked it last out of 170 member nations for its response to climate change. And despite Australia's claims to the contrary, the UN has previously said the nation is not on track to reach its modest Paris Agreement targets of a 26-28% cut on 2005 levels by 2030. Mr Morrison, who became leader in 2018, has consistently defended Australia's climate policies as adequate. The nation experienced a catastrophic fire season in its 2019-2020 summer - during which Mr Morrison was criticised for downplaying the role of climate change and travelling to Hawaii for a family holiday during the peak of the crisis.

Foreign Minister Marise Payne said on Monday that if Mr Morrison did not attend there would still be senior level representation at the meeting. ""It's not a no-show at the conference. Australia will be strongly represented at the conference no matter by which senior Australian representative and our commitment is very clear,"" she told the ABC.

"This video can not be played Labourâs shadow chancellor says she would invest in ""good jobs in the green industries of the future"" Labour has promised to spend an extra Â£28bn a year on making the UK economy more ""green"" if it wins power. Shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves said the money would go on offshore wind farms, planting trees and developing batteries. In her speech to Labour's annual conference in Brighton, she also pledged to phase out business rates to help the Covid-damaged High Street. And she said giant tech firms would pay more tax in future. An aide to Ms Reeves told the BBC the Â£28bn would come from government borrowing and the investment should ""have a positive impact"" on the wider economy. Labour backs Starmer over party rules reforms Labour needs policies now, says Burnham Rayner renews attack on Johnson in scum row In her speech, Ms Reeves said: ""I will be a responsible chancellor. I will be Britain's first green chancellor."" She added: ""I will invest in good jobs in the green industries of the future, giga-factories to build batteries for electric vehicles, a thriving hydrogen industry, offshore wind with turbines made in Britain, planting trees and building flood defences, keeping homes warm and getting energy bills down, good new jobs in communities throughout Britain."" Rachel Reeves is the shadow chancellor with something for everyone. For the Labour Party activists crying out for ambitious pledges following a series of lukewarm announcements there was Â£28bn a year of investment to help the UK reach its climate targets. She also went after some of the most potent symbols for party members: private schools and Jeff Bezos, the founder of Amazon (""if you can afford to fly to the moon, you can afford to pay your taxes here on earth!"") For the business community there was a promise to axe business rates and replace the Â£30bn of revenue withâ¦ something. For those who thought it was all a bit too much she unveiled some fiscal rules that could lightly limit her room to spend and borrow, and a new value for money ""hit squad"" that would scrutinise government spending. She has also upped her speech game significantly, introducing a group of keyworkers in the front row to rapturous applause and lowering her voice dramatically to deliver her soundbites. Ms Reeves said the annual Â£28bn investment - which would continue until 2030 - would help ""protect our planet for future generations"". It would include the Â£3bn shadow business secretary Ed Miliband promised to help make the UK steel industry carbon-neutral in his conference speech on Sunday. Labour is expected to make a series of announcements on where the rest of the money would go. Greenpeace UK welcomed the overall spending pledge, with its head of politics, Rebecca Newsom, saying: ""Tackling the climate crisis has to be at the heart of what the Treasury does."" The independent Climate Change Committee estimates the cost of making the UK carbon-neutral will bebetween 1% and 2% of GDP,externaluntil 2050. Based on last year's figures, that would equate to between Â£19.6bn and Â£39.2bn a year. During her half-hour speech, Ms Reeves said a Labour government would freeze business rates in England until 2023 and make rates relief for smaller firms more generous. It would eventually scrap rates completely, she said, replacing them with a new ""modern"" business tax, which the party is yet to define. Labour is also proposing a new tax on commercial property. And it is proposing to increase the digital services tax - paid by search engines and social media firms - from 2% to 12%, when it is replaced by a higher global corporation tax rate agreed as part of aninternational scheme. Ms Reeves told the conference the party would bring in the ""biggest overhaul of business taxation in a generation"", allowing businesses to ""lead the pack, not watch opportunities go elsewhere."" She announced plans to scrap ""hundreds"" of tax breaks and set up an Office of Value for Money, which aides describe as a ""hit squad"" to scrutinise government spending and ensure tax is used wisely. Ms Reeves said a Labour government would tell firms which have received contracts to deal with the Covid pandemic but under-delivered to repay the money given to them by the government. ""We will set up a team to go through every line of every failed contract where value was not delivered, and claw back every penny of taxpayers' money we possibly can,"" she added, ""because that money belongs in our police, it belongs in our schools and it belongs in our NHS."" The policies announced by Ms Reeves were welcomed by the Federation for Small Businesses, whose national chair Mike Cherry said: ""The shadow chancellor is right to propose concrete reform of a business rates tax which disproportionately burdens the small businesses and sole traders at the heart of local communities."" But Conservative Party co-chairman Oliver Dowden said: ""Successive Labour leaders have threatened businesses with tax hikes, higher bills, and more red tape.

"Hayden's mum Shauna raised enough money to get her son's surgery carried out in Turkey ""To be put in a position where you're basically begging off people, it's infuriating."" Last October, 12-year-old Hayden Kildea was diagnosed with severe scoliosis, a condition where the spine twists and curves to the side. Left untreated, it can become a dangerous and life-limiting condition. The Kildeas, who live in Strabane, Northern Ireland, say they were told Hayden would need urgent surgery - but that because of the backlog caused by the pandemic, he would have to wait more than two years. His mum Shauna found a clinic in Turkey that was able to carry out the operation immediately, but it would cost Â£50,000 - money the family didn't have. So in the summer, they turned to crowdfunding and campaigning to raise the money. She says: ""It's really, really frustrating that we're in our own country and we can't get Hayden the surgery he needs."" This video can not be played Staff at a north London GP surgery spoke of  ""overwhelming"" pressure Millions of people across the UK are currently on NHS waiting lists - in Northern Ireland there are over 465,000 people, while in England, 5.6m are queuing for treatment. Data shared with BBC Panorama shows that on average, waiting lists have grown by 50% in the most deprived parts of England since the start of the pandemic, compared with nearly 35% in the most affluent areas. The research, conducted by the King's Fund, also shows that people on waiting lists in poorer areas are nearly twice as likely as those in wealthier areas to wait more than one year for treatment. The data looks at waiting lists from April 2020 to July 2021 (the latest available data) and includes planned hospital treatments such as knee and hip replacements, cataract surgery and other common procedures. Hayden Kildea's family reached their target. He has now had the operation in Turkey and is recovering back at home. The Health and Social Care Board in Northern Ireland said patient demand continued ""to exceed capacity across a range of specialties"". It added: ""As a result, even before the pandemic, the number of people waiting longer than the target waiting times was increasing."" Sofia felt she couldn't wait for an NHS procedure Sofia Jones, 36, has endometriosis - a gynaecological condition that leads to severe pelvic pain. Some days she could barely walk, having to stay in bed all day. Sofia, who lives near Dundee, says she was told she'd have to wait two years for an NHS operation. But that felt too long to wait, so she and her partner decided to take out a Â£7,000 loan to pay to have the surgery in a private hospital. 'It was a really tough decision to go private,"" she says, ""because we were having to put ourselves into debt. And that's a lot of money. But you have to have some quality of life."" A Scottish government spokesman said: ""We're sorry the unprecedented impact of the pandemic has lengthened waiting times for some patients. The pandemic has been the most significant challenge the NHS has faced in its 73-year history, and as in many health care systems across the world, the unavoidable pausing of non-urgent elective procedures has resulted in some delays."" According to Anita Charlesworth, chief economist at the Health Foundation think tank: ""The big worry about long waits leading people to have to go private is that it will increase inequalities, but also that many people will be forced to make awful trade-offs over their finances in order to be able to get access to the care that they need when they need it. ""And that goes against every grain of why we set up the health service,"" she said. Brenda Pugh, 61, from Petersfield in Hampshire, had to give up work in a law firm in 2019 after being diagnosed with arthritis. She was unable to work due to the pain caused by her arthritis which was first diagnosed five years ago. As the pandemic began, she was told she needed a double hip replacement and now has to use crutches. When she moves she says it's like ""walking on jagged glass"". The pain is so severe she has written to her consultant, begging him for the operation. She says: ""I can't carry on like this. My life just isn't worth living."" Brenda Pugh, 61, had to give up work because of arthritis The cost to have the surgery privately would be about Â£10,000 per hip - and she says there's no way she can afford that. Brenda is one of 62,000 patients who've been waiting more than 12 months to get joint replacement surgery. New research conducted by charity Versus Arthritis and given exclusively to BBC Panorama reveals that half (54%) of people with arthritis who are currently waiting for surgery are facing an average cost of Â£1,739 a year to keep their pain at bay, through things like private physio appointments and over-the-counter painkillers. Inevitably, GPs are the ones patients turn to for help managing their pain as they wait. One of them, Dr Leora Harverd, from a practice in north London, says she's overwhelmed by her current caseload. Some of her patients are anxious about long delays for treatment, and says it's not unusual that people go private, but ""it's not how it should be"". This month the government announced they would be investing Â£36bn in NHS and social care for all four home nations up to 2025. Analysis of their plans by the Health Foundation shows that Â£10bn has been committed to address the backlog in England over the next three years. Ms Charlesworth says it's a lot of money but won't necessarily be enough: 'If we want the waiting list to come down by the next election, we would need to spend at least Â£13bn; if we wanted to meet the target to treat people within 18 weeks, we need to be spending Â£17bn - and the government has committed Â£10bn."" But even the prime minister has admitted that ""waiting lists will get worse before they get better"". NHS England said: ""Caring for more than 450,000 seriously ill Covid patients has inevitably had a knock-on effect on non-urgent care. ""NHS staff have stepped up and made effective use of additional resources helping carry out millions more tests, checks, treatments and operations this summer compared to last.""

"There have been several protests around the M25 in the past two weeks Climate change protesters have defied a court order and blocked part of the M25 at Heathrow Airport. A total of 53 people have been arrested as Insulate Britain blocked the slip road at junction 14 just after 08:00 BST. The road has now reopened. A High Court injunctionbanning protests around the M25 and Dartford Crossing was issued last Thursday. ""You can throw as many injunctions at us as you like, but we are going nowhere,"" the campaign group said. Police have arrested 53 people Ministers had hoped the High Court injunction would prevent further disruption around London It is the latest of several protests targeting major roads in the south east. The order, which was granted to National Highways Ltd, states demonstrators are banned from ""causing damage to the surface of or to any apparatus on or around the M25 including but not limited to painting, damaging by fire, or affixing any item or structure thereto"". The blocked junction has since fully reopened It adds that those involved ""may be held to be in contempt of court and may be imprisoned, fined or have their assets seized."" The injunction includes slip roads and bridges. Ministers had hoped the High Court injunction would prevent further disruption around London. In statements read out last week at the Home Office, the campaigners said: ""We are more scared of the destruction of our country than we are of breaking an injunction. ""There are times when we have to step up and do what is right."" The group, an offshoot of Extinction Rebellion, is calling for the government to insulate homes in the UK to help cut carbon emissions. It wants heat-saving measures installed in social housing by 2025 and all homes by 2030. Protesters were dragged away from the protest Protester Dr Diana Warner, 62, a retired GP from Bristol, said she was protesting out of ""desperation"". ""This is the fifth time I've been here trying to block a motorway because the only way to get the government to listen is to disrupt things,"" she said. Ms Warner added she ""completely understood"" people's frustrations with the protest however what was at risk was the ""lives of our children and grandchildren"". ""I'm really sorry but I'm determined to do everything I can to make us safe and change society ... we have to try.""

"Aldi UK's chief executive Giles Hurley is confident the supermarket chain can weather any storms in the supply chain The boss of supermarket chain Aldi UK has told the BBC he doesn't envisage any disruption for customers this Christmas. There have been dire warnings about food shortages and empty shelves due to a chronic shortage of heavy goods vehicle (HGV) lorry drivers. But chief executive Giles Hurley says his deliveries are moving as normal. ""There's no doubt current circumstances are testing the industry...but it's business as usual for us,"" he said. Like many other retailers, Aldi, Britain's fifth biggest supermarket, had to increase salaries for its delivery drivers, however it won't reveal by how much. ""At the moment, we're well set, but I have to say we're never complacent,"" said Mr Hurley. ""We're always recruiting, always have done and that won't change."" Farmers warn of Christmas turkey shortage Supermarket bosses warn over Christmas supplies Industry fears food shortages could be permanent Retailers are starting to ramp up their supplies to ensure everything is in place for peak festive trading. This year, the battle for consumers' Christmas spend won't just be about who has the best products - it's shaping up to be a contest over who can keep the shelves full. Mr Hurley is feeling confident: ""I think we're uniquely placed to weather the storm - we have a refined range and fewer suppliers. ""We actually employ more of our drivers directly than a majority of the market and on leading terms and conditions and finally a lot of what we source is British and that means our supply chains are a little shorter and easier to control."" 2020 was challenging for the discounters as huge numbers of shoppers moved to online grocery shopping. For the first time in a decade, Aldi and Lidl lost market share to their rivals. Tesco has warned food prices could rise by up to 5% this winter In figures just released, Aldi saw its sales for the 12 months to December 2020 grow by 10% to Â£13.5bn, while pre-tax profits dipped by 2.5% to Â£265m. Aldi has also announced Â£1.3bn of investment over the next two years as it pushes ahead with its store opening plan. The supermarket chain wants to add another hundred stores in 2022 and 2023, creating 2,000 new jobs. Fraser McKevitt, head of retail and consumer insight at market research firm Kantar, says the discounters are quickly making up for the ground they lost. ""During the lockdowns people tended to do all their shopping in one place which favoured the big four retailers,"" he told the BBC. ""Shoppers are now more comfortable being out and about again and are happy to visit multiple stores to get what they need - that's good news for Aldi and Lidl, which typically benefit from people making those combination shops."" With a cost of living squeeze looming this winter, discounters will hope to gain more business, he says. Aldi says that in the last 12 weeks alone, it has already welcomed 600,00 new customers to its stores. But food prices are also starting to pick up, as retailers face a host of rising costs, from boosting driver pay to increasing commodity prices, packaging and shipping costs. Retail experts think big supermarkets will do better this Christmas than discounters Some of those costs will have to be passed on to shoppers - the question is how much. Tesco's chairman John Allan has warned that food prices could rise by up to 5% this winter. Mr Hurley isn't concerned, however. ""Well look if that's what Tesco deliver, I think that's great for our business, because that means that we'll just see the price gap widen,"" he said. Although no one in the grocery industry is immune to inflation, he feels Aldi has a ""very unique business model"", which means the supermarket chain will be able to ""insulate customers far better than anyone else"". However many shoppers will be tightening the purse strings this autumn and shop prices, as well as availability of products, will be a key focus for consumers. Grocery expert Bryan Roberts believes all retailers are facing a tricky Christmas with supply chain issues, during a period when the big supermarkets traditionally do well as shoppers are willing to spend more on products. ""Compared to the 2008 financial crisis, when Aldi received a massive boost, the big supermarkets are in a much better place to defend themselves, with two of the big four matching Aldi's prices on key items and all of them massively improving their economy own label ranges and investing in lower prices,"" he said.

"This video can not be played ""It's their dream and their livelihoods"" Almost 500,000 requests have been made for Northern Ireland's high street voucher scheme - but  some people complained that they could not access the website used for the process. Everyone aged 18 and over can apply for a Â£100 ""spend local"" card to use in shops before the end of November. There were problems withthe application page on the NI Direct site,externalafter it opened on Monday morning. Economy Minister Gordon Lyons said ""not everybody has to rush at once"" to it. Some people complained on social media that the website had crashed on them while others said they had not received a verification message after entering their email address. Speaking to BBC News NI's Evening Extra programme on Monday, Mr Lyons acknowledged there was ""huge demand"". By Monday evening, there had been 475,081 requests for an applications link, 200,994 links issued and almost 97,000 applications completed, he said. Mr Lyons said the verification messages were being sent ""in a staged process just to make sure the website isn't overwhelmed all at once"". He added that almost 15% of the population had started their applications. ""There is a card available for everyone that is eligible so I would encourage people to apply for that over the coming weeks,"" he said. Economy Minister Gordon Lyons has been promoting the voucher scheme in recent weeks The cards are expected to arrive between seven and 10 days after you apply. They can be used in any shop with a card machine but cannot be used online or for gambling or legal services like penalties. A phone application service will open on 11 October for anyone who does not have access to the internet. The online and phone application processes will remain open until 25 October. Q&A: How can I get a high street voucher card? The Â£145m scheme is designed to boost activity in businesses hit hardest by the coronavirus pandemic, like non-essential retail and hospitality. High streets and town centres were already facing a tough time before the pandemic began with the rise in online shopping. It is hoped the voucher scheme will encourage more people to go out to shops, which could help the economic recovery. There has been a warning, however, that fraudsters may attempt to target the scheme. Eddie Lynch, the commissioner for older people, said there had been reports of cold callers in Newtownards attempting to scam people out of handing over their bank details after promising to help with their applications. ""We have seen this all too often over many years where people latch on to issues and try to target older people and others to scam them from their money,"" he said. ""It's about raising the awareness of that and making sure people are vigilant. ""If anyone does call you to help you with this scheme that you don't know, just either close the door or put down the phone."" It's finally here after almost a year - the high street voucher scheme was first suggested last November. Timing is key for this policy in order to make sure it has the maximum economic impact. But as we head into this winter, the wider economic conditions mean consumers are facing a ""cost-of-living crunch"". Things like rising energy bills as well as an end to both the furlough scheme and uplift in universal credit mean many consumers won't be able to afford to spend their Â£100 on a treat. They may instead be forced to spend it on essentials, for example a weekly grocery shop in one of the big supermarkets which were never forced to close. The scheme's success will depend on how and where shoppers choose to spend their Â£100. Linda McHenry, who owns a women's clothes shop in Ballymoney, County Antrim, said she hoped people would think of the card as a bonus. ""Support your local independent shops - this is their dream, it's their livelihood,"" she said. ""Come out and experience again what it's like to physically shop for the day."" Some businesses are already working on incentives and offers to try to encourage people to choose to spend with them. One shop owner said: ""If they don't come and support independents, there won't be any."" For example, one electronics retailer is already offering customers an additional 10% discount. Shop owner Andy Kilpatrick said: ""We want to help shoppers make their voucher go that little bit further. ""We appreciate it's also tough times for people out there looking for Christmas presents and things so by giving an extra 10% that could help improve people's shopping budgets."" President of Ballymoney Chamber of Commerce Winifred Mellett said the town's independent retailers were providing ""brilliant promotions"". ""I'm not going to tell you what they are at the moment because we are going to wait for a few days and then surprise everybody,"" she said. Ms Mellett also owns a women's clothes shop in the town, and has worked on the shop floor for decades. ""We felt that shoppers were drifting away from independent shops and now, all of a sudden, they are coming back and that's a feeling that's come from Covid,"" she said. ""If they don't come and support independents there won't be any and what would the high street be like? ""Everybody loves a wee bit of shopping."" Some businesses are working on offers to try to encourage people to choose to spend with them Londonderry Chamber of Commerce chief, Paul Clancy, said the voucher scheme has been ""badly needed"". ""It is great to have a real positive story for the High Street, to get people back on the High Street and increase the footfall. ""We would love to see it spent in the local, smaller shops that have really struggled, that would be great. But at the end of the day money going back anywhere into the local economy is good for everybody,"" he said. The trade organisation Retail NI has urged shoppers to spend their voucher cards in locally-owned, independent shops. Its chief executive Glyn Roberts also expressed some concern that the online portal could be overwhelmed if everyone tries to apply as soon as it opens to the public. ""With a scheme of this ambition and size we are bound to experience some problems and would urge shoppers to be patient,"" he said. ""If people can wait a few days before making their application, hopefully we can avoid any delays or problems with a rush on the online portal and they will receive their voucher on a timely basis."" Mr Roberts also said that 70p in every Â£1 spent with an independent retailer ""is recycled around the economy, supporting local producers and manufacturers"". ""As the scheme opens and consumers are thinking about how to spend their voucher, we would strongly encourage them to use with local independent retailers,"" he added. AodhÃ¡n Connolly, director of the Northern Ireland Retail Consortium, said the voucher scheme would provide a ""welcome boost"" during a ""lull time in retail and hospitality"". ""For me, the main thing about this is to get people back on the high streets, to get them to rediscover the high streets and actually one of the knock-ons from this is that people can see it is safe and welcoming to return to high streets across Northern Ireland,"" he told BBC News NI. ""As long as they are spending it on bricks and mortar retail, that's all that we can ask."" Q&A: How can I get Â£100 high street voucher card?

"Theatres have said they are at breaking point because of the 1m social distancing rule Stormont ministers have agreed to end social distancing restrictions for shops, theatres and a number of other indoor settings in Northern Ireland. The executive has asked some sectors to put in place mitigations including proof of double vaccination or a negative lateral flow test. But this will be advice and not legally enforceable. Ministers did not consider social distancing in the hospitality sector during Monday's virtual meeting. Instead, this will be further discussed on 7 October, First Minister Paul Givansaid in a social media post,external. He added that the changes for indoor seated venues, indoor visitor attractions and retail settings will take effect from 18:00 BST on 30 September.That is the date when the UK-wide furlough scheme ends. Social distancing of at least 1m (3ft) has been a legal requirement in many indoor premises in Northern Ireland. However, those who run venues hosting concerts, conferences and theatres in Northern Ireland have said they are at  breaking point because of the rule. While social distancing measures are to be removed, the executive agreed that face coverings will remain a legal requirement in retail settings and for indoor attractions. They also called for people ""to utilise all other available mitigations such as hand sanitising, good ventilation, and using one-way systems where possible"". Hospitality businesses like pubs and cafes have to serve fewer customers because of social distancing rules BBC News NI's Political Editor Enda McClafferty said it is understood venues will be under no legal obligations to put mitigation measures in place, rather, this will be on an ""opt-in"" basis. On proof of Covid status for entry, he said: ""Venues have been asked to put in place a number of mitigations including proof of being fully vaccinated, proof of a negative lateral flow test or proof of natural immunity through a positive Covid PCR test within the previous six months."" Business groups have previously asked for the law to be relaxed as it is affecting trade. Hospitality businesses are having to serve fewer customers in order to adhere to social distancing rules and venues cannot operate to their full capacity, meaning a drop in revenue from ticket sales. For weeks, Northern Ireland's First Minister Paul Givan has been urging his executive colleagues to relax the rules, previously saying that he wanted to see all Covid-19 restrictions lifted by the end of September. His party colleague, Economy Minister Gordon Lyons said on Monday that he ""wanted to see movement"" on social distancing rules ""as soon as we can"". ""I have been contacted by a number of people who work in that industry who are concerned about the impact that these restrictions continue to have on the viability of their events and on their businesses as well,"" he added. However, Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill has previously argued for a more ""cautious approach"", expressing concern about infection rates and the knock-on effect on hospitals. England, Scotland and Wales have already lifted a number of social distancing requirements England abolished its mandatory social distancing measures on19 July, with a small number of exceptions for settings like hospitals, care homes and border control posts. Wales lifted its legal requirements on social distancing on7 August, leaving it to individual businesses to decide their own rules after risk assessments. Scotland dropped its social distancing requirements on9 August, but a 2m (6ft) rule remains in place for Scottish healthcare settings such as hospitals, doctors' surgeries and dentists. The business group Hospitality Ulster has been a vocal critic of Stormont's social distancing rules. After last Thursday's executive meeting, Hospitality Ulster chief executive Colin Neill said he was ""hugely disappointed by the lack of movement"" on Covid-19 restrictions. The EU's Digital Covid Certificate is being rolled out across EU member states Meanwhile, the SDLP said Infrastructure Minister Nichola Mallon had been ""blocked"" in her efforts to introduce a vaccine certification scheme for entry to some venues where social distancing measures will soon be removed. Ms Mallon argued against a proposal from the DUP and Sinn FÃ©in which will see social distancing measures dropped in indoor seated venues without the requirement of vaccine certification. Speaking after the executive's announcement, her party leader Colum Eastwood said it had been a ""moment to act"" and such a programme could have increased vaccine uptake, ""particularly in younger age groups"". ""It is astounding and reckless that DUP and Sinn FÃ©in ministers have kicked the can down the road instead of bringing certainty and clarity,"" he explained. ""Not only does this offer no incentive for vaccination it puts the onus entirely on businesses themselves. ""This is a cop out and another failure of leadership."" Previously, Sinn FÃ©in said it would support a proposal for vaccine passports to gain access to pubs and restaurants in Northern Ireland if it was recommended by Stormont health officials.

"This video can not be played A church in the village of Arkalochori was reduced to a pile of rubble At least one person has been killed and several injured after a 5.8-magnitude earthquake hit the Greek island of Crete, local officials say. The man died when the dome of a church that was being renovated in the town of Arkalochori caved in. People were sent rushing out on to the streets when the earthquake struck at 09:17 (06:17 GMT). Many buildings were damaged and some reduced to piles of rubble from the initial quake and strong aftershocks. People who live in damaged, older buildings are being advised to stay outdoors. Some 2,500 tents were set up to house those who could not safely return to their homes on Monday, government minister Christos Stylianidis told Greece's Ant1 news. He also declared a state of emergency in the Heraklion region - where Arkalochori is located. British woman Millie Mackay and her nine-year-old daughter Eleni are on holiday in Crete and were in their ground floor hotel room when the earthquake hit. ""Glasses started smashing so we ran outside by the pool,"" Ms Mackay told the BBC. ""There the bosses guided us to a place of safety... [The manager] was then calling out room numbers and checking if everyone was out and OK."" Local resident Evangelia Christaki told AFP news agency that she had just enough time to grab her husband, who has a disability, and run outside as her house shook. ""Fortunately, our home was not too badly damaged,"" she said. ""But the authorities have told us to stay outdoors over the next hours. In any case, we are so scared."" The small farming town of Arkalochori, located about 30km (18 miles) from the island's capital Heraklion, was particularly badly hit by the earthquake. Pictures from the area show damaged shop fronts and crumbled buildings. Local media is reporting that safety inspections are now under way, with members of Greece's disaster response unit flown in with sniffer dogs and specialised rescue equipment. Rescuers searched through the rubble of the demolished church in Arkalochori ""This is not an event that occurred without warning,"" seismologist Gerasimos Papadopoulos said on Greece's state broadcaster, ERT. ""We have seen activity in this region for several months. This was a strong earthquake, it was not under sea but under land and affecting populated areas,"" he added. The European Mediterranean Seismological Centre (EMSC) initially recorded a magnitude of 6.5 while the United States Geological Survey (USGS) put it at 6.0. The Athens Geodynamic Institute later said the 5.8 quake struck 23km (14 miles) north-west of the coastal village of Arvi, at a depth of 10km. Both Greece and Turkey sit on fault lines and earthquakes are common. Have you been affected by the earthquake?

Phil McCannBBC News I told you earlier about some of the Covid survivors I met at the the Royal Preston Hospital. Here's the moment an emotional Jean told me she believes the vaccine saved her life. This video can not be played The furlough scheme, which protected millions of jobs during the pandemic, is being wound up at later this week, at the end of September From March 2020 to the end of this month, the cost of furlough will come to about Â£66bn, according to estimates from the Office for Budget Responsibility. That's a huge sum, about one fifth of the money the government has spent on the response to Covid. The government says it has supported 11.6 million jobs in that time. With it coming to an end, many forecasters, including the Bank of England, are expecting a small rise in unemployment after furlough ends. That's because some employers with workers on furlough may find they cannot afford to keep them on when furlough ends. International travel - and other businesses which depend on it, are still seriously disrupted. Some furloughed workers in these areas may lose their jobs. You can read more on furloughhere. Let's take a look at what the daily figures tell us about the coronavirus situation in the UK today. Case numbers are still high with another 37,960 new infections in today's data. But deaths are steadying with another 40 reported. Some schools in Cumbria have asked pupils to wear face masks again because of rising Covid-19 cases in the area. Health bosses are now reviewing whether to introduce the move across the whole county - despite it not being required under England's national guidelines. County public health director Colin Cox said Cumbria was seeing the highest levels ever but only among children and young people. Schools in west Cumbria have seen the most ""significant outbreaks"", Cox says. Last week some secondary schools saw 4,000 coronavirus cases per 100,000 in the Allerdale council area. And it was announced last week that siblings of positive children in the county were being told to isolate to try to reduce infection rates. The pupils were told they should also take a PCR test before returning to school. Read more here. NI's largest Covid-19 vaccination centre opened at the Odyssey SSE Arena in Belfast in March 2021 As we are reporting, the UK has fully-vaccinated more than two thirds of the entire population, but take-up of the jab continues to vary by country, according to analysis by the PA news agency. While Scotland and Wales have both managed to give two doses of vaccine to 70% of their respective populations, the equivalent figure for Northern Ireland is just over 63%. In England the figure currently stands at just under two-thirds. There is also wide variation among age groups. At least 95% of people in Scotland in all groups aged 55 and over have had both doses, but in Wales this threshold has been reached just for groups aged 70 and over. In England it has been reached only for people aged 60 to 64 and 70 to 79. Northern Ireland reports its vaccination uptake in larger age groups, with the latest data suggesting two doses have been given to more than 95% of people aged 60-69, 70-79 and 80 and over. The UK has joined a handful of countries to have fully vaccinated more than two-thirds of its entire population against Covid-19. More than 44.7 million second doses have now been delivered in the UK, according to government figures - the equivalent of just over 66.6% of the total population. Other countries to have already passed this figure include Canada, with at least 70% of people fully vaccinated, Chile at 73% and Singapore at 76%. A number of European nations have also beaten the UK to the milestone of two-thirds fully jabbed, such as Italy with 67%, Belgium at 71%, Ireland with 73% and Spain at 77%. Portugal continues to lead the world, however, with at least 84% of its total population having now received two doses of the vaccine. Figures for other countries have been compiled by Our World in Data using the latest official information from governments and health ministries. Covid vaccines: How fast is progress around the world? The UK has fully vaccinated more than two thirds of its population but, as more people are fully-jabbed, the rate of vaccinations is slowing The UK has given a total of 93,500,858 coronavirus vaccinations. That's 48,736,534 first doses and 44,764,324 second doses. Here's how the UK's vaccine rollout is goingin charts. There have been a further 40 coronavirus-related deaths in the UK,according to the government's daily statistics.,external And 37,960 new infections have also been recorded - that's the highest figure since 9 September. The town with England's highest rate of Covid infections has seen its figure nearly double within a week. Kettering, in Northamptonshire, saw 900 cases per 100,000 people in the week to 22 September. The number rose sharply among secondary school-aged pupils, which officials say accounts for most cases. The county's joint director of public health Lucy Wightman is urging people to ""continue to play their part in preventing further spread"". Parents and students have been asked to test themselves twice a week. Officials say secondary school children suspected of having the virusshould not go in until they have had a negative PCR test. Scottish Labour has reported the Test and Protect system's data on coronavirus contact tracing times to the UK's statistics watchdog. It follows a report that official figures did not include ""failed"" contact tracing attempts - where the Test and Protect team were not able to reach positive cases by phone. The Scottish Sun reported there had been more than 50,000 such failed cases in a year, making up about 10% of all Test and Protect cases. The newspaper says these failed cases were not included in the weekly figures published by Public Health Scotland (PHS), which are used to determine if the system is meeting the international standard of the World Health Organization (WHO). The target is for 80% of cases to have their close contacts traced and quarantined within 72 hours of the case being confirmed. The Scottish Government says it is confident in its interpretation of the PHS data and how it relates to the WHO standard. A spokesman for the UK Statistics Authority confirms it has received a complaint from Scottish Labour's health spokeswoman Jackie Baillie. These people are all in masks - but never wearing one in enclosed spaces raises the chances of testing positive, the survey found The Office for National Statistics (ONS)has released its latest report,externalon who is most likely to be testing positive for coronavirus at the moment. The dates it looked at were the fortnight ending 11 September, and it covers all of the UK. It found that people who had received at least one dose of a coronavirus vaccine were less likely to test positive for coronavirus. And those more likely to record a positive test included:  The data comes from people taking part in the ONS coronavirus infection survey - a large household monitoring survey that looks at infection within the community. It excludes those in hospitals, care homes and other institutional settings.  Patience AtuhaireBBC News, Kampala Uganda is ramping up vaccination of priority populations A study by Ugandan scientists has found vaccination against
Covid-19 significantly reduced deaths in the country. There were no deaths recorded among fully vaccinated patients during the research period. There were also fewer deaths among those who were partially vaccinated. The study, conducted between May and July this year, used data collected
from 1,462 patients admitted at two of the largest Covid-19 treatment centres in the capital, Kampala. Some were fully vaccinated while others had only received their first
dose of AstraZeneca, which was the only vaccine available in the country
then. The researchers from Makerere University, working under the
institutionâs Research and Innovation and Fund, also found vaccinated
patients were 45% less likely to die during hospitalisation. It was done during a period when Covid infections threatened to
overwhelm the health system, as the country suffered its second wave. The study is being published at a time when Uganda is ramping up
vaccination of priority populations. From Monday, teachers and students above 18 years will be offered a vaccine as the government targets a phased reopening of the
education sector starting in November. Uganda has recorded a total of 3,146 Covid-19 deaths since the pandemic
begun. Nearly two million vaccine jabs have so far been given out countrywide.

Online applications can now be made for Â£100 high street vouchers to spend in places like clothing retailers and hospitality venues before the end of November. Read more Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent The fuel supply problemsin parts of the UK have an impact on the NHS like the rest
of society. Ambulance services have their own fuel pumps at their depots
so there is no immediate risk that a crew in need of fuel should not be able to
fill up their tanks today. Those in-house pumps will need restocking at some point and
clearly ambulance services will be prioritised for supplies. There is â as one service put it â no realistic scenario
where ambulances run out of fuel. But the bigger concern is for staff who are travelling
around in their own vehicles, either to get to work or to see patients in the
community. Nearly all are reliant on using public petrol stations.
Already the UK Homecare Association has raised concern that the service
provided by carers in peopleâs homes has been disrupted with staff running out
of petrol and caught in queues, ending up late for calls. The association, along with others like the British Medical
Association, are calling for health and care staff to be prioritised for fuel. During previous fuel shortages councils have arranged
systems to ensure essential workers are able to fill up their cars. The message coming from a number of health and care bodies
is that this must be brought in and quickly.  Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst Zhong Nanshan is China's answer to Chris Whitty, England's chief medical officer Cases of Covid-19 persist in two Chinese provinces, and are threatening peopleâs plans for an upcoming national holiday. Golden Week - from 1-7 October - is fast approaching, the second biggest travel period in China after the Lunar New Year. This year, 650 million Chinese are expected totravel for the festivities,external. The holiday begins with Chinaâs National Day, and Chinaâs answer to Chris Whitty, Zhong Nanshan, has this year sung a songto mark the country's ""birthday"".,external However, cases of Covid-19 are still being identified daily in two Chinese provinces: northeast Heilongjiang and southeast Fujian province. The Ministry of Culture and Tourism earlier warned that travel companies might have to âimmediately suspend trans-provincial group tours, air tickets and hotel reservation servicesâif these regions canât drop their daily cases to zero.,external There have been more than 400 cases confirmed in Fujian in recent weeks.  But the South China Morning Post newspapernotes today that cases have eased in the province,external. However, the national Global Times newspaper says that in Heilongjiang, cases have spread beyond Harbin,the one city where the virus had been identified,external. Both regions are discouraging residents against travelling and are rolling out mass testing drives to identify symptomatic and asymptomatic people. As we've heard today, letters offering Covid vaccination appointments are beingsent out to 12 to 15-year-oldsin Scotland. Every child in this age group in the UK is now being offered a single vaccination dose. InScotland, as well as being invited to book an appointment at a clinic, 12 to 15-year-olds can get vaccinated at drop-in centres. InEnglandandNorthern Ireland,the programme is mostly based in schools. And inWales, vaccination centres are being used, withdifferent arrangements in place between areas. It is hoped the measure will help prevent further disruption to their education. Vaccinating children should help keep cases down, although it won't stop the spread of Covid in schools. Evidence suggests a single jab cuts the risk of catching the Delta variant by about 55%. It also reduces the chances of getting very sick or spreading it to someone else.

"This video can not be played A church in the village of Arkalochori was reduced to a pile of rubble At least one person has been killed and several injured after a 5.8-magnitude earthquake hit the Greek island of Crete, local officials say. The man died when the dome of a church that was being renovated in the town of Arkalochori caved in. People were sent rushing out on to the streets when the earthquake struck at 09:17 (06:17 GMT). Many buildings were damaged and some reduced to piles of rubble from the initial quake and strong aftershocks. People who live in damaged, older buildings are being advised to stay outdoors. Some 2,500 tents were set up to house those who could not safely return to their homes on Monday, government minister Christos Stylianidis told Greece's Ant1 news. He also declared a state of emergency in the Heraklion region - where Arkalochori is located. British woman Millie Mackay and her nine-year-old daughter Eleni are on holiday in Crete and were in their ground floor hotel room when the earthquake hit. ""Glasses started smashing so we ran outside by the pool,"" Ms Mackay told the BBC. ""There the bosses guided us to a place of safety... [The manager] was then calling out room numbers and checking if everyone was out and OK."" Local resident Evangelia Christaki told AFP news agency that she had just enough time to grab her husband, who has a disability, and run outside as her house shook. ""Fortunately, our home was not too badly damaged,"" she said. ""But the authorities have told us to stay outdoors over the next hours. In any case, we are so scared."" The small farming town of Arkalochori, located about 30km (18 miles) from the island's capital Heraklion, was particularly badly hit by the earthquake. Pictures from the area show damaged shop fronts and crumbled buildings. Local media is reporting that safety inspections are now under way, with members of Greece's disaster response unit flown in with sniffer dogs and specialised rescue equipment. Rescuers searched through the rubble of the demolished church in Arkalochori ""This is not an event that occurred without warning,"" seismologist Gerasimos Papadopoulos said on Greece's state broadcaster, ERT. ""We have seen activity in this region for several months. This was a strong earthquake, it was not under sea but under land and affecting populated areas,"" he added. The European Mediterranean Seismological Centre (EMSC) initially recorded a magnitude of 6.5 while the United States Geological Survey (USGS) put it at 6.0. The Athens Geodynamic Institute later said the 5.8 quake struck 23km (14 miles) north-west of the coastal village of Arvi, at a depth of 10km. Both Greece and Turkey sit on fault lines and earthquakes are common. Have you been affected by the earthquake?

We are going to be bringing the live page to a close soon so here's a recap of the day's coronavirus developments: People queue for a coronavirus vaccine in Egyptian capital Cairo Earlier today we heard that Wales is to merge the green and amber country lists, joining England which had already announced it was going to do so from 4 October. The red list - for countries considered highest risk - will remain, with arrivals still needing to pay for a quarantine hotel. The change means fully vaccinated travellersarriving from non-red list countries,externalwill no longer have to take a PCR or lateral flow test before they set off for the UK. This includes people vaccinatedin the UK, the EU, the US or 18 other recognised countries,external. Travellers will still have to take a PCR test two days after arrival. People who are not fully vaccinated willstill need a pre-departure test and a PCR test,externalon days two and eight after they return. They must also self-isolate for 10 days. Test to Release,externalwill remain an option for unvaccinated passengers to England who want to shorten quarantine. But what else is changing and which tests do you need for going on holiday? We've got an explainerherewith all the information you might need if you are going away. Phil McCannBBC News I told you earlier about some of the Covid survivors I met at the the Royal Preston Hospital. Here's the moment an emotional Jean told me she believes the vaccine saved her life. This video can not be played The furlough scheme, which protected millions of jobs during the pandemic, is being wound up at later this week, at the end of September From March 2020 to the end of this month, the cost of furlough will come to about Â£66bn, according to estimates from the Office for Budget Responsibility. That's a huge sum, about one fifth of the money the government has spent on the response to Covid. The government says it has supported 11.6 million jobs in that time. With it coming to an end, many forecasters, including the Bank of England, are expecting a small rise in unemployment after furlough ends. That's because some employers with workers on furlough may find they cannot afford to keep them on when furlough ends. International travel - and other businesses which depend on it, are still seriously disrupted. Some furloughed workers in these areas may lose their jobs. You can read more on furloughhere. Let's take a look at what the daily figures tell us about the coronavirus situation in the UK today. Case numbers are still high with another 37,960 new infections in today's data. But deaths are steadying with another 40 reported. Some schools in Cumbria have asked pupils to wear face masks again because of rising Covid-19 cases in the area. Health bosses are now reviewing whether to introduce the move across the whole county - despite it not being required under England's national guidelines. County public health director Colin Cox said Cumbria was seeing the highest levels ever but only among children and young people. Schools in west Cumbria have seen the most ""significant outbreaks"", Cox says. Last week some secondary schools saw 4,000 coronavirus cases per 100,000 in the Allerdale council area. And it was announced last week that siblings of positive children in the county were being told to isolate to try to reduce infection rates. The pupils were told they should also take a PCR test before returning to school. Read more here. NI's largest Covid-19 vaccination centre opened at the Odyssey SSE Arena in Belfast in March 2021 As we are reporting, the UK has fully-vaccinated more than two thirds of the entire population, but take-up of the jab continues to vary by country, according to analysis by the PA news agency. While Scotland and Wales have both managed to give two doses of vaccine to 70% of their respective populations, the equivalent figure for Northern Ireland is just over 63%. In England the figure currently stands at just under two-thirds. There is also wide variation among age groups. At least 95% of people in Scotland in all groups aged 55 and over have had both doses, but in Wales this threshold has been reached just for groups aged 70 and over. In England it has been reached only for people aged 60 to 64 and 70 to 79. Northern Ireland reports its vaccination uptake in larger age groups, with the latest data suggesting two doses have been given to more than 95% of people aged 60-69, 70-79 and 80 and over. The UK has joined a handful of countries to have fully vaccinated more than two-thirds of its entire population against Covid-19. More than 44.7 million second doses have now been delivered in the UK, according to government figures - the equivalent of just over 66.6% of the total population. Other countries to have already passed this figure include Canada, with at least 70% of people fully vaccinated, Chile at 73% and Singapore at 76%. A number of European nations have also beaten the UK to the milestone of two-thirds fully jabbed, such as Italy with 67%, Belgium at 71%, Ireland with 73% and Spain at 77%. Portugal continues to lead the world, however, with at least 84% of its total population having now received two doses of the vaccine. Figures for other countries have been compiled by Our World in Data using the latest official information from governments and health ministries. Covid vaccines: How fast is progress around the world? The UK has fully vaccinated more than two thirds of its population but, as more people are fully-jabbed, the rate of vaccinations is slowing The UK has given a total of 93,500,858 coronavirus vaccinations.

"Aldi UK's chief executive Giles Hurley is confident the supermarket chain can weather any storms in the supply chain The boss of supermarket chain Aldi UK has told the BBC he doesn't envisage any disruption for customers this Christmas. There have been dire warnings about food shortages and empty shelves due to a chronic shortage of heavy goods vehicle (HGV) lorry drivers. But chief executive Giles Hurley says his deliveries are moving as normal. ""There's no doubt current circumstances are testing the industry...but it's business as usual for us,"" he said. Like many other retailers, Aldi, Britain's fifth biggest supermarket, had to increase salaries for its delivery drivers, however it won't reveal by how much. ""At the moment, we're well set, but I have to say we're never complacent,"" said Mr Hurley. ""We're always recruiting, always have done and that won't change."" Farmers warn of Christmas turkey shortage Supermarket bosses warn over Christmas supplies Industry fears food shortages could be permanent Retailers are starting to ramp up their supplies to ensure everything is in place for peak festive trading. This year, the battle for consumers' Christmas spend won't just be about who has the best products - it's shaping up to be a contest over who can keep the shelves full. Mr Hurley is feeling confident: ""I think we're uniquely placed to weather the storm - we have a refined range and fewer suppliers. ""We actually employ more of our drivers directly than a majority of the market and on leading terms and conditions and finally a lot of what we source is British and that means our supply chains are a little shorter and easier to control."" 2020 was challenging for the discounters as huge numbers of shoppers moved to online grocery shopping. For the first time in a decade, Aldi and Lidl lost market share to their rivals. Tesco has warned food prices could rise by up to 5% this winter In figures just released, Aldi saw its sales for the 12 months to December 2020 grow by 10% to Â£13.5bn, while pre-tax profits dipped by 2.5% to Â£265m. Aldi has also announced Â£1.3bn of investment over the next two years as it pushes ahead with its store opening plan. The supermarket chain wants to add another hundred stores in 2022 and 2023, creating 2,000 new jobs. Fraser McKevitt, head of retail and consumer insight at market research firm Kantar, says the discounters are quickly making up for the ground they lost. ""During the lockdowns people tended to do all their shopping in one place which favoured the big four retailers,"" he told the BBC. ""Shoppers are now more comfortable being out and about again and are happy to visit multiple stores to get what they need - that's good news for Aldi and Lidl, which typically benefit from people making those combination shops."" With a cost of living squeeze looming this winter, discounters will hope to gain more business, he says. Aldi says that in the last 12 weeks alone, it has already welcomed 600,00 new customers to its stores. But food prices are also starting to pick up, as retailers face a host of rising costs, from boosting driver pay to increasing commodity prices, packaging and shipping costs. Retail experts think big supermarkets will do better this Christmas than discounters Some of those costs will have to be passed on to shoppers - the question is how much. Tesco's chairman John Allan has warned that food prices could rise by up to 5% this winter. Mr Hurley isn't concerned, however. ""Well look if that's what Tesco deliver, I think that's great for our business, because that means that we'll just see the price gap widen,"" he said. Although no one in the grocery industry is immune to inflation, he feels Aldi has a ""very unique business model"", which means the supermarket chain will be able to ""insulate customers far better than anyone else"". However many shoppers will be tightening the purse strings this autumn and shop prices, as well as availability of products, will be a key focus for consumers. Grocery expert Bryan Roberts believes all retailers are facing a tricky Christmas with supply chain issues, during a period when the big supermarkets traditionally do well as shoppers are willing to spend more on products. ""Compared to the 2008 financial crisis, when Aldi received a massive boost, the big supermarkets are in a much better place to defend themselves, with two of the big four matching Aldi's prices on key items and all of them massively improving their economy own label ranges and investing in lower prices,"" he said.

"Beautician Aimee Simpson wants to buy her first home in Edinburgh but cannot afford to Aimee Simpson has spent years saving for a one-bedroom flat. She's 28, works as a beautician and has sacrificed a social life to raise Â£30,000 for a deposit. The problem is, Aimee - who still lives with her parents - wants to buy a place near her work in Edinburgh. With the biggest rise in house prices for 14 years, she can find nothing in her price range in a city squeezed by a shortage in affordable homes and rocketing rent costs. ""A lot of the new builds are just too expensive because they're at a premium,"" she said. ""I've looked at more rundown properties that I would do up, but you're up against property developers - with bigger budgets. ""It is a struggle and you just hit walls everywhere you look."" When Aimee left school in May 2011, the average price for a flat in Edinburgh was Â£164,252. Today, it's Â£236,608. ""It's really disheartening,"" she toldBBC Scotland's Disclosure programme. ""I feel like I could work seven days and still not be any better off."" This video can not be played Aimee, from Edinburgh, and Katherine, from Skye, are both facing struggles finding somewhere to stay She thought about applying to the Scottish government's Low-cost Initiative for First Time Buyers (Lift) scheme, which offers financial assistance for a share in the property. But the scheme's cap for one-bedroom properties in Edinburgh is just Â£125,000. Its rules also state the purchase price can't be higher than a property's Home Report valuation - meaning it is unlikely to be used in the city's competitive market. Lift is now the only government-backed assistance for first-time buyers in Scotland. Aimee added: ""I just feel like Edinburgh's my home. I want to be near my family."" Over the last 10 years, the average price of a home Edinburgh increased by Â£100,000 BBC Scotland's Disclosure has been hearing from young people either priced out of home ownership in the city or unable to find affordable rent. As well as the increase in average house prices, Edinburgh has seen steeper rises in rent prices - around 46% - than any other part of Scotland. ""The market just now is absolutely frantic,"" said Gary Middlemass, an Edinburgh estate agent with 40 years' experience. ""There is simply not enough properties coming on. When something does come on the market there tends to be a lot of interest, which pushes up prices."" However, two Scottish government schemes to aid first-time buyers are coming to an end. The Help to Buy scheme, which supported more than 17,000 new build house sales over the last eight years, is closed to new applications and will end in March 2022. Last year, 80% of those accessing the scheme were first-time buyers, more than half of purchases involved two people and the average household income of applicants was Â£42,000. Meanwhile, the First Home Fund, which assisted 9,000 buyers in just over a year, has been closed despite its early success. The Scottish government has said the decision to scrap the schemes is a result of cuts to its financial transaction budget by the UK government. House builders say their cancellation will ""limit the life choices"" of young people hoping to buy a home. ""I've got real concerns about the people in the middle, those who can't get on to the housing market,"" said Nicola Barclay, chief executive of industry body Homes for Scotland. ""They're earning just a little bit too much, so they can't get a social house. And private rent is stopping them from saving up the kind of deposits that they need to then move onto the housing ladder. ""Their choices are just really limited now."" She highlighted that in England the Help to Buy scheme still exists and is targeted at first-time buyers. Another initiative has also been introduced in England called First Homes, which is a form of shared ownership. ""We have nothing equivalent in Scotland now,"" said Ms Barclay. ""I think it is so unfair that a young adult who has chosen to live and work in Scotland, is unable to buy a house whereas if they had exactly the same job in England, they could do."" Estate agents say there are not enough properties coming on to the market at the moment Housing Secretary Shona Robison described first purchase figures as ""very buoyant"" but defended the decision to close both initiatives. ""The evidence was showing us that actually people using that [Help to Buy] scheme could afford to buy their own home,"" she said. ""But with government assistance they were perhaps buying a bigger property and a more expensive property. ""We have a judgement to make with limited resources. We believe the best investment for those resources is to help those who could not afford to buy their own home without government assistance."" In 2007, the Scottish government predicted house price inflation would cause problems for lower income families. Then Deputy First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said 35,000 homes of all types had to be built a year to reset the balance. However, Scotland's house building industry has yet to return to the pre-financial crash levels of 25,000 a year. The rising costs in Edinburgh has also put pressure on the city's social housing stock, with 21,000 applicants currently on the waiting list. In the last decade, more than 8,300 affordable homes have been built in Edinburgh with 2,100 under construction Families find themselves either priced out by rising rent costs, or given notice to leave their homes as landlords looking to sell take advantage of the increase in house prices. ""I'm not going to pretend it is easy for people, "" said housing convenor, councillor Kate Campbell. ""We have 6,000 people who are currently homeless and we don't have a huge supply of social housing, that's why we're building more."" In the last decade, 8,390 affordable homes have been built in the city. Another 2,100 are currently under construction. Meanwhile, the city is also seeing a growth in so-called ""Build to Rent"" properties - private rented flats aimed at those unable to afford a mortgage but unlikely to get into social housing. Across Scotland, nearly 10,000 are in the pipeline, with more than 3,000 in Edinburgh. The Scottish government has pledged to build 110,000 affordable homes - 70% of which will be social rent - before 2032. This video can not be played 'There's six of us in this tiny flat' But some families are still waiting years for a suitable home. Michael Urquhart, his partner Kara, and their four children have been on Edinburgh's social housing list for 10 years. They've had six privately rented homes in that period and have spent time in one of the city's homeless bed-and-breakfasts. They are currently living in a two-bedroom ex-council flat in the Prestonfield area and bid for social housing each week on the city's online EdIndex system, which sees hundreds of applications per property. Michael said: ""I think I'm probably going to be here for at least another couple of years, just because the bidding's not going well. ""I'd rather just keep myself here, until I can get my forever home."" Additional reporting by Katie McEvinney and Craig Williams.

"Projected results from Germany's federal elections suggest the centre-left has edged ahead of the conservatives of Angela Merkel The centre-left SPD candidate, Olaf Scholz, said the country had voted for change It's the conservatives' worst-ever performance but leader Armin Laschet says it's all to play for Laschet says he too could lead a governing coalition, though he acknowledges the results are disappointing The parties in third and fourth place, the Greens and the liberal FDP, will be the kingmakers in coalition negotiations Angela Merkel is standing down as chancellor after 16 years in power But with the race this tight, we could be waiting weeks to find out who gets the top job Paul Kirby, Claudia Allen and Joshua Nevett Thank you for following our live coverage of Germany's elections - which will, eventually, see a replacement for Angela Merkel as chancellor voted in by the new MPs. We're wrapping up our coverage now, but here are the main things you need to know from election night:  You can read our full news story on the electionhere.  Angela Merkel has dominated German politics for 16 years A reminder that Angela Merkel remains German chancellor until her replacement is elected by parliament - and that could easily take weeks or months. If she's still in post on 17 December she will become Germany's longest serving post-war chancellor. How will history remember her? Hereâs the assessment of four experts. She has turned German politics into a discussion about policy rather than politics, saysMatt Qvortrup, professor of political science at Coventry University. She has staged a bit of a revolution in German politics and world politics generally. Her position has been symbolically important for women's representation, saysCharlotte Galpin, senior lecturer in German and European politics at the University of Birmingham. Yet, such symbolic representation doesn't automatically mean wider change, especially for women of colour and the LGBTQ+ community. Her policy legacy is a somewhat bizarre mix of modernisation and backwardness, saysDr RÃ¼diger Schmitt-Beck, professor of political science at the University of Mannheim. Many of the modernising features would not be expected from a Christian Democratic chancellor. Her legacy is a determined and silent one, saysDr Katrin Schreiter, lecturer in German and history at King's College London. Her leadership is based on sober evaluation and projecting reliability. You can read more expert verdicts on Merelâs legacyhere. As we've been reporting, the parties projected to come third and fourth in the election - the Greens and the liberal Free Democrats (FDP) - will be the kingmakers in coalition negotiations. While the Greens have been delighted at their relatively strong showing, their numbers have fallen substantially compared to opinion polls earlier in the summer - which showed the party in the lead nationally. Speaking to the BBC, Omid Nouripour, a member of parliament for the Greens and their spokesman on foreign affairs, said the party could have done better but it was fighting against public perceptions. ""This is one of the funniest moments when you are doing your campaign and people come over and tell you you're a prohibition party... you want to take us away cars, airplanes, I don't know, bridges or rivers or whatever,"" said Mr Nouripour. ""This is a clichÃ© which you have to tackle."" ""We didn't do a proper job on that in the last weeks and this is one of the mistakes maybe we have to talk about,"" he added. ""But at the end of the day these clichÃ©s will not last forever and we're going to fight it."" The Green lead candidate, Annalena Baerbock, promised the next government would be a climate government. But the Greens' policy of funding the fight against global warming through higher taxes is in direct contrast to the low taxation proposed by the FDP - a more natural ally of the centre right. The SDP and the conservatives have already made overtures - separately - to the FDP and the Greens, but negotiations are likely to be long and difficult. Sira ThierijBBC News, Berlin âShe brought a lot of stability, she was like a rock,â says 18-year-old student Laura of the outgoing chancellor. Angela Merkel is still a very popular leader, but when a government does eventually get formed, she will leave German politics for good. For Laura, the outgoing chancellor did not do a good enough job âBut especially when it comes to giving young people a voice, they really missed their shot. She didnât prepare this country for change.â In all, 14% of voters are under 30, but an estimated 38% are 60 or over. Tackling the climate crisis is key for âGeneration Merkelâ - some of whom can't remember another chancellor - and the Greens are most popular for 18- to 29-year-olds. âGermany should care less about making money and instead look after future generations. We should be an example for other countries,â says Rebecca, 23, from Berlin. Rebecca is among many Germans who see climate change as top priority Marion Wenzelâs home was ravaged by the summer floods in Ahrweiler. âIâm so busy with rebuilding I didnât have any time for the partiesâ programmes.Our biggest task is to have a clear way for the future.â Blogger Diana zur LÃ¶wen, 26, is worried that not enough will change: âWe have to tackle digitisation and optimise education. Iâm not sure if all the parties have a good programme for that. Young people are not really the main focus.â Manuela Schwesig has won a convincing victory in state elections We've been focusing on the federal elections - but two German states are also voting in new assemblies. In the north-eastern Mecklenburg-West Pomerania, the SPD are well ahead of all the other parties. State premier Manuela Schwesig is set to stay in the role she's held since 2017. In Berlin the SPD are also ahead in the battle to control the city-state's assembly - but the Greens are close behind them. Charlotte GalpinSenior lecturer in German and European politics at the University of Birmingham The AfD has been particularly strong in eastern German states in recent years Following its first entry into the Bundestag in 2017, the AfD is set to repeat its success at this election. While in some regions support for the party has declined, and its highs of around 15% in the polls around 2018/9 have dropped, it had been polling at a steady 10-12% across Germany ahead of the election. Tonight's preliminary results show it is likely to receive about 11% of the vote nationally, and be the largest party in the eastern states of Saxony and Thuringia. These are territories of the former GDR where the radical right has been particularly strong since the early 1990s, and which suffered socio-economic deprivation as a result of the reunification between East and West Germany. While in other regions the AfDâs support is lower, the consistent support for an anti-immigration and Islamophobic party of around a tenth of voters across Germany demonstrates a wider problem with racism and suggests that the party has found a steady core voter base. The Greens were leading in the polls at one point The Greens are on track to be part of the next government based on tonight's results. For a brief period during the election campaign the Greens and their candidate, Annalena Baerbock, topped the opinion polls with 28%. For a party that had only once previously polled more than 10% in a national election (in 2009) these were dizzying heights and further proof that climate change had moved front and centre in German minds. The Green Party has been in government before as a junior partner, but never with this level of support. You might remember Joschka Fischer, the Greensâ leader who served as foreign minister and vice-chancellor from 1998-2005 under Germanyâs last centre-left leader Gerhard SchrÃ¶der. With the centre-left Social Democrats (SDP) on course for a narrow victory, members have been reflecting on what a win would mean for the party, which hasn't led a German government since 2005. Katarina Barley, a senior European Parliament member with the SDP, told the BBC that it would amount to ""absolute revival."" ""Yes of course, we would have liked to be in front more clearly, but I'm sure that this will evolve through the evening,"" Ms Barley said. She suggested that more was achievable on issues like climate change in a coalition which did not feature the conservative CDU/CSU alliance. ""When it comes to climate change, there is not much you can do. [Conservatives] oppose nearly everything, and you see it in the states also where the conservatives are in coalitions with the Greens - nothing moves,"" said Ms Barley. ""So if we get out of this coalition with the conservatives, I think we will see a lot of progress when it comes to climate change,"" she added. Some children have given politicians a tough time on the campaign trail Kids can be cruel, especially to German politicians, it seems. Surprisingly, the toughest interviewers of the election campaign turned out to be children. First, there was the grilling of Tino Chrupalla, one of the lead candidates for the far-right AfD party. He said wanted more German poems taught in schools but, when asked to name one, couldnât do so. âMy favourite poem is... I canât think of any,â he said, after a long and painful pause. Then there was the child interrogation of the three main chancellor candidates in a toy-filled tent. When quizzed about his âunhealthyâ smoking habit, a flustered Armin Laschet replied: âYes, thatâs right but so many things are unhealthy. But I donât really inhale.â Youngsters gave Olaf Scholz and Annelena Baerbock a rough ride too. Scholz was asked to explain why the German government hadnât done more to stop migrants from drowning en route to Europe, while Baerbock faced a bruising question about allegations she inflated her achievements on her CV. Dr RÃ¼diger Schmitt-BeckProfessor of political science at the University of Mannheim Armin Laschet has taken a battering in media coverage of his campaign The CDUâs dramatic shift in the polls from quiet erosion into something more reminiscent of an implosion can be attributed to a â partly self-induced â leadership crisis. The party can thank the unshakeable popularity of outgoing Chancellor Angela Merkel for a significant portion of its remaining support in recent years. The boots her successor is supposed to fill are very large indeed, and there are doubts over whether Armin Laschet has the necessary stature for this monumental task. The challenges, criticism, and backstabbing from within his own party, even before his nomination, were not exactly helpful. His media image quickly crystallised into one of a candidate of dubious competence in matters of policy and limited ability as a campaigner, but with a great talent for gaffes. In media coverage, everything Laschet came up with was interpreted as a tactical stunt, hastily thought up in a desperate attempt to keep the ship from sinking. Of course, this kind of news coverage can only further undermine the candidateâs credibility among voters. For Laschet, it appeared impossible to escape this narrative. Sira ThierijBBC News, Berlin Angela Merkelâs conservatives are heading for a
historically low result in Germany's election, with latest projections coming in at
just above 24%. âWeâre disappointedâ, says Peter, a CDU member in Berlin.
âWeâre confident that weâre still in the game for forming a government. But we
thought we would be above 30%.â Eva believes not enough emphasis was put on the party's policies Eva, another CDU supporter, tells me these elections were more about choosing individual candidates than party programmes. ""I think that is what put us off.â Members still found a reason to cheer at a local election party tonight: âThere was no majority for the leftist parties and thatâs a good thing, I think,"" says Johannes. A coalition between the Social Democrats, Greens and the far left  will be impossible if projected results are borne out. While the results are still trickling in, we know that it's likely that more than two political parties will be needed to form a majority in Germany's next parliament. That's because - even if they do get just enough seats to form a majority together - the two main parties, the SPD and the CDU/CSU, are not at all keen to continue to work together in coalition, as they have been doing for the past four years. The SPD looks to be in pole position to lead the next government, as it is currently projected to win the largest share of the vote nationally, albeit by a slim margin. Letâs walk you through some of the coalition combinations that are possible, based on preliminary results. Each combination is given a nickname based on the traditional colours of each party.  It's worth noting that theâred-red-greenâcoalition does not seem possible at this point, because the left-wing Die Linke party is not projected to win enough votes to enter the Bundestag. And the far-right AfD are unpalatable to all the other parties - so they won't feature in any coalition at the federal level. The two other coalition possibilities shown above would have enough seats to govern - but are unlikely as they both require the conservatives and the centre-left SPD to team up (with the addition of a third party). And as we've said, that prospect is unappealing to the two big ""people's parties"", as they're known in Germany. We're just hearing that the conservative CDU has lost the constituency of Chancellor Angela Merkel - who's standing down as an MP at this election - in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania state. The centre-left SPD has won the seat in the far north-east of the country. Mrs Merkel has held the constituency since 1990, so this victory for the centre-left marks a major shift. We'll bring you further results from across the country as we get them. Here's a quick look at the three biggest parties' plans for the German economy, should they be in government after today's vote. The conservative CDU/CSU have promised no tax increases and tight public finances.They want Germany to return to a balanced budget after debt ticked up during the pandemic. The SPD wants to build 100,000 new social housing annually, a minimum wage of â¬12 (Â£10; $14) an hour, and a wealth tax of 1% to address inequality. The Greens also want to raise the hourly minimum wage to â¬12, and bump the top tax rate from the current 42% to 48%. A party's underway at the Greens' election event in Berlin - as supporters celebrate the party's best-ever parliamentary election results. The BBC's Damien McGuinness is there...

Two parties appear to have cornered the under-30s vote in this election, according to initial projections. The Greens and the liberal FDP between them appear to have polled over 40% of younger voters. The FDP and Greens look like they're potential kingmakers in the upcoming coalition talks, whichever of the two biggest parties ends up with the most seats in parliament. What's perhaps surprising is that the Social Democrats didn't do quite as well with younger voters. Far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) top candidate Alice Weidel said her party had done well The far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party is on course to win the largest share of the vote in the eastern state of Saxony, according to preliminary results. So far, the party has won more than 28% of second votes (which show voters' party preference) in the state, well ahead of the SPD with 19%. The AfD has also performed well in the neighbouring state of Thuringia, with 24% of the second votes (slightly ahead of the SPD on 23%). In recent years the AfD has tended to do well in eastern Germany. The AfD has managed to woo voters from the centre-right and even the centre-left with its emphasis on Islam and migration. Those issues have galvanised some voters, especially men with nationalist attitudes. But on a national level, the party's share of the vote in this election is projected to be lower than the last one in 2017, when it received almost 13%. Earlier Alice Weidel, one of the party's top candidates, said considering the negative media treatment of the AfD, the party had done well. ""We are in the double figures, we have been able to assert ourselves,"" she said. All the other parties likely to be represented in the Bundestag have long ruled out forming a coalition with the AfD. BBC World Service ""We have made
climate change the number one issue in this election, it's been a climate
election and that's a victory for the Greens"". That's the verdict of Daniel Freund, a German member of the European Parliament for the Greens. On climate policy he told the BBC World Service:
""It is important that we get into action now, that we start shutting off
the coal power plants very soon, we will then increase measures as we go"". I absolutely believe that Germany can abandon coal by 2023. It is absolutely crucial that we make this exit sooner than currently agreed Daniel Freund, Green MEP Thumbs up for the SPD's Olaf Scholz It's just after 23:00 local time, and the centre-left Social Democrats look to be on course for a razor-thin victory in Germany's parliamentary elections - but they will need to form a coalition to build the next government. The party's candidate Olaf Scholz has said the country voted for change - and says voters want him to replace Angela Merkel as chancellor after 16 years. Even so, Armin Laschet, the candidate for Mrs Merkel's conservatives, has declared the outcome ""unclear"" and said he too wants to become Germany's new chancellor. But he acknowledged his party has plunged to a historic low. The progressive Greens appear to have made big gains, but not to have a viable shot at the chancellery. Along with the free-market Free Democrats, they look likely to play a key role in coalition talks. But with many more people voting by post than usual, it could be a while before we know the full outcome of the poll. Nick BeakeBBC News, SPD HQ in Berlin We just tried to ask Olaf
Scholz if heâs confident heâll soon be dealing with Boris Johnson and other
world leaders, but he was tight-lipped and his sizable security guards
whisked him away. But latest projections have given the SPD a slight lead and, after several hours of relative quiet, they've decided it's safe to strike
up the band. First up was Donât Stop Believing and it seems
the party faithful heading to the impromptu dancefloor are increasingly
confident in their belief their man will lead the next coalition government. We
hear the party leader has now gone for the night. As he slipped into the warm Berlin evening air, Message in a Bottle was blasting out. The young SPD party
members think the German people have sent a message at the
ballot box. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking.",Negative,8.878982e-12
"This video can not be played Olaf Scholz of Germany's Social Democratic Party: ""Many voters... wanted a change in government"" Germany's centre-left Social Democrats (SPD) have claimed victory in the federal election, telling the party of outgoing Chancellor Angela Merkel it should no longer be in power. SPD leader Olaf Scholz said he had a clear mandate to form a government, while his conservative rival Armin Laschet remains determined to fight on. The two parties have governed together for years. But Mr Scholz says it is time for a new coalition with the Greens and liberals. Preliminary results gave his party a narrow election win over the conservatives who suffered their worst-ever performance. Despite this, Mr Laschet said his party had given him its backing to enter talks with coalition partners, pushing Germany towards a potentially protracted power struggle. The Greens and pro-business Free Democratic Party (FDP) attracted the most support from the under-30s, in an election dominated by climate change and by differing proposals on how to tackle it. The Greens made history with almost 15% of the vote, even though it was well short of their ambitions. It was the tightest race in years, bringing an end to the post-war domination of the two big parties - Mr Scholz's SPD and his rival's conservative Christian Democratic Union (CDU). Exit polls predicted a dead heat, but this election was unpredictable from the start, and the result was never going to be the end of the story. For one thing, the outgoing chancellor is going nowhere until the coalition is formed - and that may have to wait until Christmas. The main parties want a new government in place by the time Germany takes over the leadership of the G7 group of nations in January. The next chancellor's task is to lead Europe's foremost economy over the next four years, with climate change at the top of voters' agenda. German elections usher in change with a small 'c' 'Bazooka man' Scholz aiming for German chancellor Mr Scholz's SPD supporters greeted him in raptures, but it was only later when his party edged into the lead that he told a televised audience the voters had given him the job of forming a ""good, pragmatic government for Germany"". Speaking on Monday he said there were three parties that were on the up - his party, the Greens and the liberals - and it was time for the conservatives to back down. ""I think that the people in Germany want the Christian Democratic Union in opposition. This is their result now, what they decided during the election,"" he said in English. This video can not be played Swipe left or right? Germany's election dating game, explained His conservative rival has dug in, arguing it was about forging a coalition, not about getting ""an arithmetic majority"". Winner doesn't take all, in other words. On Monday, Mr Laschet said ""no party has emerged from this election with a clear mandate to form a government"". He said he would lead ""exploratory talks"" with the liberal FDP and the Greens - the favoured coalition partners of the CDU/CSU alliance. CDU General Secretary Paul Ziemiak did not gloss over the defeat early on Monday but said that was not the point: ""In the end the question is going to be can you create a genuine project for the future?"" ""Two maybe-chancellors and two kingmakers"" - was one of the headlines summing up Sunday night's rather scrappy result, but that is what it looked like. Because it's not just the Social Democrat and conservative leaders fighting for power. The two kingmakers are open to offers and planning to talk to each other to explore common ground. Together the liberals and the Greens make up over quarter of the vote and would carry both of the big parties over the line. They may be more popular with younger voters than any other parties, but it would take some skill to bring them under the same roof. A Greens spokesman on Monday said it was no big secret that they were not close to the liberals. Greens leader Annalena Baerbock wants to loosen Germany's debt brake that stops a big jump in public debt. FDP leader Christian Lindner has little time for her party's ""ideas of tax hikes, or softening the debt brake"". So of all the possible coalitions, the Greens and the liberals feature in the two that are most likely to form. One is the so-called traffic-light coalition, made up of the parties' colours - red (SPD), yellow (FDP) and the Greens - or there's the Jamaica alternative, black (CDU), yellow (FDP) and the Greens. It is the first time that Germany is facing a three-way coalition, but this country has entered a new political era and the talking is yet to begin. Beyond the four mainstream parties, it was a bad night for the radical left and a patchy night for the far right. Left-wing Die Linke fell below the 5% threshold required to get into parliament but survived because it secured three direct mandates. And although the far-right AfD's share of the vote appears to have slipped nationally, it's set be the largest party in the eastern states of Saxony and Thuringia.

"Projected results from Germany's federal elections suggest the centre-left has edged ahead of the conservatives of Angela Merkel The centre-left SPD candidate, Olaf Scholz, said the country had voted for change It's the conservatives' worst-ever performance but leader Armin Laschet says it's all to play for Laschet says he too could lead a governing coalition, though he acknowledges the results are disappointing The parties in third and fourth place, the Greens and the liberal FDP, will be the kingmakers in coalition negotiations Angela Merkel is standing down as chancellor after 16 years in power But with the race this tight, we could be waiting weeks to find out who gets the top job Paul Kirby, Claudia Allen and Joshua Nevett Thank you for following our live coverage of Germany's elections - which will, eventually, see a replacement for Angela Merkel as chancellor voted in by the new MPs. We're wrapping up our coverage now, but here are the main things you need to know from election night:  You can read our full news story on the electionhere.  Angela Merkel has dominated German politics for 16 years A reminder that Angela Merkel remains German chancellor until her replacement is elected by parliament - and that could easily take weeks or months. If she's still in post on 17 December she will become Germany's longest serving post-war chancellor. How will history remember her? Hereâs the assessment of four experts. She has turned German politics into a discussion about policy rather than politics, saysMatt Qvortrup, professor of political science at Coventry University. She has staged a bit of a revolution in German politics and world politics generally. Her position has been symbolically important for women's representation, saysCharlotte Galpin, senior lecturer in German and European politics at the University of Birmingham. Yet, such symbolic representation doesn't automatically mean wider change, especially for women of colour and the LGBTQ+ community. Her policy legacy is a somewhat bizarre mix of modernisation and backwardness, saysDr RÃ¼diger Schmitt-Beck, professor of political science at the University of Mannheim. Many of the modernising features would not be expected from a Christian Democratic chancellor. Her legacy is a determined and silent one, saysDr Katrin Schreiter, lecturer in German and history at King's College London. Her leadership is based on sober evaluation and projecting reliability. You can read more expert verdicts on Merelâs legacyhere. As we've been reporting, the parties projected to come third and fourth in the election - the Greens and the liberal Free Democrats (FDP) - will be the kingmakers in coalition negotiations. While the Greens have been delighted at their relatively strong showing, their numbers have fallen substantially compared to opinion polls earlier in the summer - which showed the party in the lead nationally. Speaking to the BBC, Omid Nouripour, a member of parliament for the Greens and their spokesman on foreign affairs, said the party could have done better but it was fighting against public perceptions. ""This is one of the funniest moments when you are doing your campaign and people come over and tell you you're a prohibition party... you want to take us away cars, airplanes, I don't know, bridges or rivers or whatever,"" said Mr Nouripour. ""This is a clichÃ© which you have to tackle."" ""We didn't do a proper job on that in the last weeks and this is one of the mistakes maybe we have to talk about,"" he added. ""But at the end of the day these clichÃ©s will not last forever and we're going to fight it."" The Green lead candidate, Annalena Baerbock, promised the next government would be a climate government. But the Greens' policy of funding the fight against global warming through higher taxes is in direct contrast to the low taxation proposed by the FDP - a more natural ally of the centre right. The SDP and the conservatives have already made overtures - separately - to the FDP and the Greens, but negotiations are likely to be long and difficult. Sira ThierijBBC News, Berlin âShe brought a lot of stability, she was like a rock,â says 18-year-old student Laura of the outgoing chancellor. Angela Merkel is still a very popular leader, but when a government does eventually get formed, she will leave German politics for good. For Laura, the outgoing chancellor did not do a good enough job âBut especially when it comes to giving young people a voice, they really missed their shot. She didnât prepare this country for change.â In all, 14% of voters are under 30, but an estimated 38% are 60 or over. Tackling the climate crisis is key for âGeneration Merkelâ - some of whom can't remember another chancellor - and the Greens are most popular for 18- to 29-year-olds. âGermany should care less about making money and instead look after future generations. We should be an example for other countries,â says Rebecca, 23, from Berlin. Rebecca is among many Germans who see climate change as top priority Marion Wenzelâs home was ravaged by the summer floods in Ahrweiler. âIâm so busy with rebuilding I didnât have any time for the partiesâ programmes.Our biggest task is to have a clear way for the future.â Blogger Diana zur LÃ¶wen, 26, is worried that not enough will change: âWe have to tackle digitisation and optimise education. Iâm not sure if all the parties have a good programme for that. Young people are not really the main focus.â Manuela Schwesig has won a convincing victory in state elections We've been focusing on the federal elections - but two German states are also voting in new assemblies. In the north-eastern Mecklenburg-West Pomerania, the SPD are well ahead of all the other parties. State premier Manuela Schwesig is set to stay in the role she's held since 2017. In Berlin the SPD are also ahead in the battle to control the city-state's assembly - but the Greens are close behind them. Charlotte GalpinSenior lecturer in German and European politics at the University of Birmingham The AfD has been particularly strong in eastern German states in recent years Following its first entry into the Bundestag in 2017, the AfD is set to repeat its success at this election. While in some regions support for the party has declined, and its highs of around 15% in the polls around 2018/9 have dropped, it had been polling at a steady 10-12% across Germany ahead of the election. Tonight's preliminary results show it is likely to receive about 11% of the vote nationally, and be the largest party in the eastern states of Saxony and Thuringia. These are territories of the former GDR where the radical right has been particularly strong since the early 1990s, and which suffered socio-economic deprivation as a result of the reunification between East and West Germany. While in other regions the AfDâs support is lower, the consistent support for an anti-immigration and Islamophobic party of around a tenth of voters across Germany demonstrates a wider problem with racism and suggests that the party has found a steady core voter base. The Greens were leading in the polls at one point The Greens are on track to be part of the next government based on tonight's results. For a brief period during the election campaign the Greens and their candidate, Annalena Baerbock, topped the opinion polls with 28%. For a party that had only once previously polled more than 10% in a national election (in 2009) these were dizzying heights and further proof that climate change had moved front and centre in German minds. The Green Party has been in government before as a junior partner, but never with this level of support. You might remember Joschka Fischer, the Greensâ leader who served as foreign minister and vice-chancellor from 1998-2005 under Germanyâs last centre-left leader Gerhard SchrÃ¶der. With the centre-left Social Democrats (SDP) on course for a narrow victory, members have been reflecting on what a win would mean for the party, which hasn't led a German government since 2005. Katarina Barley, a senior European Parliament member with the SDP, told the BBC that it would amount to ""absolute revival."" ""Yes of course, we would have liked to be in front more clearly, but I'm sure that this will evolve through the evening,"" Ms Barley said. She suggested that more was achievable on issues like climate change in a coalition which did not feature the conservative CDU/CSU alliance. ""When it comes to climate change, there is not much you can do. [Conservatives] oppose nearly everything, and you see it in the states also where the conservatives are in coalitions with the Greens - nothing moves,"" said Ms Barley. ""So if we get out of this coalition with the conservatives, I think we will see a lot of progress when it comes to climate change,"" she added. Some children have given politicians a tough time on the campaign trail Kids can be cruel, especially to German politicians, it seems. Surprisingly, the toughest interviewers of the election campaign turned out to be children. First, there was the grilling of Tino Chrupalla, one of the lead candidates for the far-right AfD party. He said wanted more German poems taught in schools but, when asked to name one, couldnât do so. âMy favourite poem is... I canât think of any,â he said, after a long and painful pause. Then there was the child interrogation of the three main chancellor candidates in a toy-filled tent. When quizzed about his âunhealthyâ smoking habit, a flustered Armin Laschet replied: âYes, thatâs right but so many things are unhealthy. But I donât really inhale.â Youngsters gave Olaf Scholz and Annelena Baerbock a rough ride too. Scholz was asked to explain why the German government hadnât done more to stop migrants from drowning en route to Europe, while Baerbock faced a bruising question about allegations she inflated her achievements on her CV. Dr RÃ¼diger Schmitt-BeckProfessor of political science at the University of Mannheim Armin Laschet has taken a battering in media coverage of his campaign The CDUâs dramatic shift in the polls from quiet erosion into something more reminiscent of an implosion can be attributed to a â partly self-induced â leadership crisis. The party can thank the unshakeable popularity of outgoing Chancellor Angela Merkel for a significant portion of its remaining support in recent years. The boots her successor is supposed to fill are very large indeed, and there are doubts over whether Armin Laschet has the necessary stature for this monumental task. The challenges, criticism, and backstabbing from within his own party, even before his nomination, were not exactly helpful. His media image quickly crystallised into one of a candidate of dubious competence in matters of policy and limited ability as a campaigner, but with a great talent for gaffes. In media coverage, everything Laschet came up with was interpreted as a tactical stunt, hastily thought up in a desperate attempt to keep the ship from sinking. Of course, this kind of news coverage can only further undermine the candidateâs credibility among voters. For Laschet, it appeared impossible to escape this narrative. Sira ThierijBBC News, Berlin Angela Merkelâs conservatives are heading for a
historically low result in Germany's election, with latest projections coming in at
just above 24%. âWeâre disappointedâ, says Peter, a CDU member in Berlin.
âWeâre confident that weâre still in the game for forming a government. But we
thought we would be above 30%.â Eva believes not enough emphasis was put on the party's policies Eva, another CDU supporter, tells me these elections were more about choosing individual candidates than party programmes. ""I think that is what put us off.â Members still found a reason to cheer at a local election party tonight: âThere was no majority for the leftist parties and thatâs a good thing, I think,"" says Johannes. A coalition between the Social Democrats, Greens and the far left  will be impossible if projected results are borne out. While the results are still trickling in, we know that it's likely that more than two political parties will be needed to form a majority in Germany's next parliament. That's because - even if they do get just enough seats to form a majority together - the two main parties, the SPD and the CDU/CSU, are not at all keen to continue to work together in coalition, as they have been doing for the past four years. The SPD looks to be in pole position to lead the next government, as it is currently projected to win the largest share of the vote nationally, albeit by a slim margin. Letâs walk you through some of the coalition combinations that are possible, based on preliminary results. Each combination is given a nickname based on the traditional colours of each party.  It's worth noting that theâred-red-greenâcoalition does not seem possible at this point, because the left-wing Die Linke party is not projected to win enough votes to enter the Bundestag. And the far-right AfD are unpalatable to all the other parties - so they won't feature in any coalition at the federal level. The two other coalition possibilities shown above would have enough seats to govern - but are unlikely as they both require the conservatives and the centre-left SPD to team up (with the addition of a third party). And as we've said, that prospect is unappealing to the two big ""people's parties"", as they're known in Germany. We're just hearing that the conservative CDU has lost the constituency of Chancellor Angela Merkel - who's standing down as an MP at this election - in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania state. The centre-left SPD has won the seat in the far north-east of the country. Mrs Merkel has held the constituency since 1990, so this victory for the centre-left marks a major shift. We'll bring you further results from across the country as we get them. Here's a quick look at the three biggest parties' plans for the German economy, should they be in government after today's vote. The conservative CDU/CSU have promised no tax increases and tight public finances.They want Germany to return to a balanced budget after debt ticked up during the pandemic. The SPD wants to build 100,000 new social housing annually, a minimum wage of â¬12 (Â£10; $14) an hour, and a wealth tax of 1% to address inequality. The Greens also want to raise the hourly minimum wage to â¬12, and bump the top tax rate from the current 42% to 48%. A party's underway at the Greens' election event in Berlin - as supporters celebrate the party's best-ever parliamentary election results. The BBC's Damien McGuinness is there...

Two parties appear to have cornered the under-30s vote in this election, according to initial projections. The Greens and the liberal FDP between them appear to have polled over 40% of younger voters. The FDP and Greens look like they're potential kingmakers in the upcoming coalition talks, whichever of the two biggest parties ends up with the most seats in parliament. What's perhaps surprising is that the Social Democrats didn't do quite as well with younger voters. Far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) top candidate Alice Weidel said her party had done well The far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party is on course to win the largest share of the vote in the eastern state of Saxony, according to preliminary results. So far, the party has won more than 28% of second votes (which show voters' party preference) in the state, well ahead of the SPD with 19%. The AfD has also performed well in the neighbouring state of Thuringia, with 24% of the second votes (slightly ahead of the SPD on 23%). In recent years the AfD has tended to do well in eastern Germany. The AfD has managed to woo voters from the centre-right and even the centre-left with its emphasis on Islam and migration. Those issues have galvanised some voters, especially men with nationalist attitudes. But on a national level, the party's share of the vote in this election is projected to be lower than the last one in 2017, when it received almost 13%. Earlier Alice Weidel, one of the party's top candidates, said considering the negative media treatment of the AfD, the party had done well. ""We are in the double figures, we have been able to assert ourselves,"" she said. All the other parties likely to be represented in the Bundestag have long ruled out forming a coalition with the AfD. BBC World Service ""We have made
climate change the number one issue in this election, it's been a climate
election and that's a victory for the Greens"". That's the verdict of Daniel Freund, a German member of the European Parliament for the Greens. On climate policy he told the BBC World Service:
""It is important that we get into action now, that we start shutting off
the coal power plants very soon, we will then increase measures as we go"". I absolutely believe that Germany can abandon coal by 2023. It is absolutely crucial that we make this exit sooner than currently agreed Daniel Freund, Green MEP Thumbs up for the SPD's Olaf Scholz It's just after 23:00 local time, and the centre-left Social Democrats look to be on course for a razor-thin victory in Germany's parliamentary elections - but they will need to form a coalition to build the next government. The party's candidate Olaf Scholz has said the country voted for change - and says voters want him to replace Angela Merkel as chancellor after 16 years. Even so, Armin Laschet, the candidate for Mrs Merkel's conservatives, has declared the outcome ""unclear"" and said he too wants to become Germany's new chancellor. But he acknowledged his party has plunged to a historic low. The progressive Greens appear to have made big gains, but not to have a viable shot at the chancellery. Along with the free-market Free Democrats, they look likely to play a key role in coalition talks. But with many more people voting by post than usual, it could be a while before we know the full outcome of the poll. Nick BeakeBBC News, SPD HQ in Berlin We just tried to ask Olaf
Scholz if heâs confident heâll soon be dealing with Boris Johnson and other
world leaders, but he was tight-lipped and his sizable security guards
whisked him away. But latest projections have given the SPD a slight lead and, after several hours of relative quiet, they've decided it's safe to strike
up the band. First up was Donât Stop Believing and it seems
the party faithful heading to the impromptu dancefloor are increasingly
confident in their belief their man will lead the next coalition government. We
hear the party leader has now gone for the night. As he slipped into the warm Berlin evening air, Message in a Bottle was blasting out. The young SPD party
members think the German people have sent a message at the
ballot box. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking.",Negative,0.4634296
"This video can not be played Olaf Scholz of Germany's Social Democratic Party: ""Many voters... wanted a change in government"" Germany's centre-left Social Democrats (SPD) have claimed victory in the federal election, telling the party of outgoing Chancellor Angela Merkel it should no longer be in power. SPD leader Olaf Scholz said he had a clear mandate to form a government, while his conservative rival Armin Laschet remains determined to fight on. The two parties have governed together for years. But Mr Scholz says it is time for a new coalition with the Greens and liberals. Preliminary results gave his party a narrow election win over the conservatives who suffered their worst-ever performance. Despite this, Mr Laschet said his party had given him its backing to enter talks with coalition partners, pushing Germany towards a potentially protracted power struggle. The Greens and pro-business Free Democratic Party (FDP) attracted the most support from the under-30s, in an election dominated by climate change and by differing proposals on how to tackle it. The Greens made history with almost 15% of the vote, even though it was well short of their ambitions. It was the tightest race in years, bringing an end to the post-war domination of the two big parties - Mr Scholz's SPD and his rival's conservative Christian Democratic Union (CDU). Exit polls predicted a dead heat, but this election was unpredictable from the start, and the result was never going to be the end of the story. For one thing, the outgoing chancellor is going nowhere until the coalition is formed - and that may have to wait until Christmas. The main parties want a new government in place by the time Germany takes over the leadership of the G7 group of nations in January. The next chancellor's task is to lead Europe's foremost economy over the next four years, with climate change at the top of voters' agenda. German elections usher in change with a small 'c' 'Bazooka man' Scholz aiming for German chancellor Mr Scholz's SPD supporters greeted him in raptures, but it was only later when his party edged into the lead that he told a televised audience the voters had given him the job of forming a ""good, pragmatic government for Germany"". Speaking on Monday he said there were three parties that were on the up - his party, the Greens and the liberals - and it was time for the conservatives to back down. ""I think that the people in Germany want the Christian Democratic Union in opposition. This is their result now, what they decided during the election,"" he said in English. This video can not be played Swipe left or right? Germany's election dating game, explained His conservative rival has dug in, arguing it was about forging a coalition, not about getting ""an arithmetic majority"". Winner doesn't take all, in other words. On Monday, Mr Laschet said ""no party has emerged from this election with a clear mandate to form a government"". He said he would lead ""exploratory talks"" with the liberal FDP and the Greens - the favoured coalition partners of the CDU/CSU alliance. CDU General Secretary Paul Ziemiak did not gloss over the defeat early on Monday but said that was not the point: ""In the end the question is going to be can you create a genuine project for the future?"" ""Two maybe-chancellors and two kingmakers"" - was one of the headlines summing up Sunday night's rather scrappy result, but that is what it looked like. Because it's not just the Social Democrat and conservative leaders fighting for power. The two kingmakers are open to offers and planning to talk to each other to explore common ground. Together the liberals and the Greens make up over quarter of the vote and would carry both of the big parties over the line. They may be more popular with younger voters than any other parties, but it would take some skill to bring them under the same roof. A Greens spokesman on Monday said it was no big secret that they were not close to the liberals. Greens leader Annalena Baerbock wants to loosen Germany's debt brake that stops a big jump in public debt. FDP leader Christian Lindner has little time for her party's ""ideas of tax hikes, or softening the debt brake"". So of all the possible coalitions, the Greens and the liberals feature in the two that are most likely to form. One is the so-called traffic-light coalition, made up of the parties' colours - red (SPD), yellow (FDP) and the Greens - or there's the Jamaica alternative, black (CDU), yellow (FDP) and the Greens. It is the first time that Germany is facing a three-way coalition, but this country has entered a new political era and the talking is yet to begin. Beyond the four mainstream parties, it was a bad night for the radical left and a patchy night for the far right. Left-wing Die Linke fell below the 5% threshold required to get into parliament but survived because it secured three direct mandates. And although the far-right AfD's share of the vote appears to have slipped nationally, it's set be the largest party in the eastern states of Saxony and Thuringia.
