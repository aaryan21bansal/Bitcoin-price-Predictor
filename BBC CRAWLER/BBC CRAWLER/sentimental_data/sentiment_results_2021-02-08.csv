"All travellers entering the UK will be required to take two coronavirus tests while quarantining in an attempt to prevent variants entering the country. Arrivals will be required to get a test on days two and eight of their 10-day quarantine period, whether they are isolating at home or in a hotel. The Department of Health said the move would enable authorities to track new cases more effectively. Health Secretary Matt Hancock will set out more details in the Commons later. It is in addition to the current rules which require travellers arriving in the UK - whether by boat, train or plane - to show proof of a negative Covid-19 test to be allowed entry. This test must be taken in the 72 hours before travelling, and anyone arriving without one faces a fine of up to Â£500, with Border Force officials carrying out spot checks. Travellers must provide contact details and theirUK address,external. They can then travel - by public transport if necessary - to the place where they plan to self-isolate. Who has to self-isolate and for how long? The new test and quarantine rules for travellers Why Australia's quarantine system has seen breaches The new testing policy comes amid concern about new variants entering the country that are more resistant to existing vaccines. Early trials of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine suggest it offers""minimal protection"" against mild disease from the South Africa variant. There have been 147 cases of the variant have found in the UK. Prof Andrew Pollard, director of the Oxford Vaccine Group, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the results were ""expected"" because the virus is ""introducing mutations... to allow it to still transmit in populations where there's some immunity."" ""As long as we have enough immunity to prevent severe disease, hospitalisations and death, then we're going to be fine in the future in the pandemic,"" he said. On Monday, England's deputy chief medical officer, Prof Jonathan Van-Tam, said the South African variant did not appear to have a ""transmissibility advantage"" over the one first identified in Kent, which has spread across the UK. It was therefore unlikely to ""overrun"" the Kent variant, he told Monday's coronavirus briefing. Why we should not rush to judgement on Oxford jab How worrying are the new coronavirus variants? This video can not be played The BBC's Laura Foster explains how to fly safely during a global pandemic From 15 February, UK residents and Irish nationals arriving from certain countries will have to quarantine in hotels. Passengers will have to stay in their rooms for 10 nights, with security guards accompanying if they go outside. The rules will apply to UK nationals and residents arriving from33 ""red list"" Covid-19 hotspots,external- mostly in South America and Africa - where it's feared Covid variants may have already spread. Passengers will be expected to pay for the cost of the accommodation. Non-UK travellers who have been in these countries in the 10 days before travelling are banned from entry. All travellers - including British nationals -must self-isolate for 10 dayswhen they get to the UK. The ""test to release scheme"" - where travellers from non-red list countries can leave home isolation after a negative test on day five - will remain under the new testing rules. Passengers will be expected to use the gold-standard and more expensive PCR tests. Derek Jones, chief executive of luxury travel company Kuoni, welcomed the testing plan. ""As we have said all along, a robust testing regime is the way to open up travel again but it has to replace or at least shorten quarantine,"" he said. It comes as Prof Van-Tam warned it was too soon to say to what extent people could begin to start planning summer holidays. Speaking at Monday's coronavirus briefing, he said: ""The more elaborate your plans are for summer holidays, in terms of crossing borders, in terms of household mixing, given where we are now, I think we just have to say the more you are stepping into making guesses about the unknown at this point,"" he said. ""I can't give people a proper answer at this point because we don't yet have the data. It is just too early to say."" Lockdown rules mean people mustonly travel abroad for essential reasons,external. These are the same as the ""reasonable excuses"" for domestic travel, including: Work that cannot be done from home Medical appointments Educational reasons People leaving England will soon have to make a declaration on why they need to travel, which will be checked by carriers prior to departure.

"Four cases of the Kent variant of the virus have been discovered in Manchester Surge testing for coronavirus is to be introduced in parts of Manchester after four cases of a new mutation of the Kent variant of Covid were confirmed. More than 10,000 tests are planned after cases of the E484K mutation were found in two unconnected households. Testing will take place in the Fallowfield, Hulme, Moss Side and Whalley Range districts, with extra testing centres opening. Manchester City Council said volunteers would go house-to-house offering tests. The council said it was working with Public Health England and NHS Test and Trace and everyone in the designated areas would be given a PCR swab test with results coming back within days. The surge testing will begin on Tuesday, targeting people who do not have symptoms but live or work within the testing boundary area. Surge testing is the rollout of additional community testing of people who do not have any coronavirus symptoms. It aims to help scientists and public health officials learn more about mutated Covid-19 variants. It will also help reduce the spread of infection by finding asymptomatic cases and prompting people to self-isolate. David Regan, Director of Public Health, Manchester City Council, said: ""We all know that the virus will change over time and it's important that we investigate new strains to understand how they might spread. ""This is exactly what we're doing with the intensive testing in parts of Manchester, with local testing units and people going door-to-door to offer people tests. ""There is no evidence that this variant will be resistant to the vaccines or causes a more severe illness, and it is not yet known if the strain can be passed more easily between people, but it is really important that everyone who lives in the boundary area and is over the age of 16 plays their part and gets a test."" Councillor Bev Craig, the council's executive member for adult health and well-being, said: ""It's understandable that some residents in the area may be concerned by all this, but we need to remember that it's very normal for viruses to mutate. ""We are following the public health approach to react to the new variant and we will be working... to ensure as many people as possible know how to get a test so we can understand more about this version of the virus.""

"Twenty-two people were killed and hundreds more injured in the 2017 bombing Police were told of shortcomings in a terror response plan months before the Manchester Arena attack, an inquiry has heard. The police inspectorate warned in November 2016 that ""an over-reliance"" on the officer in charge of the response could see them overwhelmed. Policing experts believe that is what happened after the May 2017 attack. A former inspector told the inquiry Greater Manchester Police (GMP) was urged to ""raise its game"" at the time. The public inquiry into the atrocity, which killed 22 people as they left an Ariana Grande concert, has been hearing about inspections of GMP around the time of the attack. It has previously heard only one paramedic was in the City Room foyer, where bomber Salman Abedi detonated his device, for the first 40 minutes after the blast and the first fire engine arrived more than two hours after the explosion. Andrew Buchan, who worked as an inspector with HM Inspectorate of Constabulary and Fire & Rescue Services, said it was identified in 2016 that GMP's plan was ""very tactically focused"". But he said it did not go into detail about working with other agencies and had placed ""an over-reliance"" on the ""force duty inspector (FDO) to lead their response to a terrorist attack"". The inspectorate's report said the number of tasks the officer would be ""expected to perform in all likelihood are so many that it may be some will not be completed or at least in the order expected"", the inquiry heard. It said the force had acknowledged that the pressures the officer would be placed under would ""bring its own challenges"", but the matter was left unresolved. It added that ""such apparent vagueness may cause confusion or doubt in a live scenario"" and there was a need ""to provide the FDO with more immediate support or resources to assist with all the functions expected of that role"". The public inquiry into the bombing is considering whether the attack could have been prevented Mr Buchan said the watchdog spoke to four duty inspectors at GMP, who said they had received no counter-terrorism training and ""felt ill prepared for that eventuality"" but would draw on the experience of other critical incidents. The inquiry heard unarmed officers, who were likely to be the first on the scene, were said to be unaware of GMP's counter-terrorism plans and did not know where to find them. It was told that none of the officers who spoke to the watchdog knew exactly what they would have to do in the event of a terrorist incident. The inquiry heard staff in GMP's control room had received no specific training to help them do their job during a terror attack. Mr Buchan said the force had been told it ""needed to raise its game"" in testing and training control room and unarmed staff before ""the awful time when a terrorist attack actually happens"". He said that in November 2016, he personally spoke to a senior GMP officer to share the shortcomings found in their inspection report, which he added were issues found in other forces throughout England and Wales. The final report into UK counter-terrorism policing was never publically published due to national security reasons. The inquiry continues.

"Elon Musk's car firm Tesla has said it bought about $1.5bn (Â£1.1bn) of the cryptocurrency Bitcoin in January and expects to start accepting it as payment in future. The news caused the price of Bitcoin to jump 17% to $44,220, a record high. Tesla said it was trying to maximise returns on cash that is not being used in day-to-day running of the company. It comes days after Mr Musk added ""#bitcoin"" to his Twitter profile page, which drove up the price. He removed it days later, but has continued talking up Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, including Dogecoin, which jumped 50% after his endorsement. Dogecoin takes off after tip by Elon Musk Bitcoin tops $34,000 as record rally continues In a stock market filing, Tesla said it ""updated its investment policy"" in January and now wanted to invest in ""reserve assets"" such as digital currencies, gold bullion or gold exchange-traded funds. It said it had already bought $1.5bn of Bitcoin and could ""acquire and hold digital assets"" in the future. ""Moreover, we expect to begin accepting Bitcoin as a form of payment for our products in the near future, subject to applicable laws and initially on a limited basis,"" it said. Mr Musk said a week ago in a tweet that Bitcoin was ""on the verge"" of being more widely accepted among investors. Some analysts said Tesla's investment could be a game-changer for the cryptocurrency. ""I think we will see an acceleration of companies looking to allocate to Bitcoin now that Tesla has made the first move,"" said Eric Turner, vice-president of market intelligence at cryptocurrency research firm Messari. ""One of the largest companies in the world now owns Bitcoin and by extension, every investor that owns Tesla, or even just an S&P 500 fund, has exposure to it as well."" But Neil Wilson, chief market analyst for Markets.com, warned that Bitcoin was a ""very volatile"" cryptocurrency. ""Tesla is now starting to take on big [foreign exchange] risk - this may not worry a lot of investors, but some conservative types might be concerned,"" he said. Bitcoin, which has hit record highs in recent months after a rollercoaster ride over the past decade, has also drawn support from major financial institutions this year. The world's biggest money manager, Blackrock, recently changed a handful of investment mandates to allow some of its funds to invest in the currency. However, central banks remain sceptical of digital currencies. In October, Bank of England governor Andrew Bailey cautioned over Bitcoin's use as a payment method. ""I have to be honest, it is hard to see that Bitcoin has what we tend to call intrinsic value,"" he said. ""It may have extrinsic value in the sense that people want it."" Mr Bailey added that he was ""very nervous"" about people using Bitcoin for payments, pointing out that investors should realise its price was extremely volatile.

"This video can not be played A number of Gardai (Irish police) checkpoints were operating along the border on Monday People driving from NI into the Republic of Ireland are being turned back at the border if they do not have an essential reason for travel. NI residents face fines from Monday if they are caught crossing the border without ""a reasonable excuse"". The unprecedented step has been taken by the Irish government in a bid to prevent the spread of Covid-19. Anyone engaged in cross-border travel in breach of Ireland's Covid-19 restrictions will be fined â¬100 (Â£88). A number of Garda (Irish police) checkpoints were operational along the border from 07:00 local time. At a checkpoint near Emyvale in County Monaghan, Insp Adrian Durcan said some people had ""turned back"" when requested. ""We have engaged with a few people who have not had essential reasons and on the advice of the guards, they have turned back,"" he said. ""I think it was three so far this morning."" A checkpoint was set up near Emyvale on the Tyrone-Monaghan border Insp Durcan said fines would be issued to those not complying with the regulations. ""They will receive the fine and have 28 days to pay the fine, failure to pay that fine will result in a court appearance,"" he said. ""If they don't pay it we will issue a summons in respect of the offence and we will follow through on that summons."" Confusion in border village over new Covid rules Northern Ireland residents who have to cross the border for essential work or essential purposes, such as seeking medical treatment, will be exempt from fines. Public health guidance in NI says people ""should not travel in or out of Northern Ireland except where it is essential to do so"". Irish police have new enforcement powers which include the right to fine people engaged in non-essential travel The new rules are the latest in a series of decisions aimed at reducing travel to and within the Republic of Ireland, but it is the first time that people from Northern Ireland will face financial penalties for non-essential cross-border travel. The Republic of Ireland is currently in the highest level of lockdown, known as ""level five"" in the government's five-stage plan for managing Covid-19. Level five measures include a strict travel ban which means residents in the Republic of Ireland are temporarily prohibited from going more than 5km (3 miles) away from their home. There areexceptions to the 5km limit,externalfor people who have to travel further for essential work; medical reasons; caring responsibilities; and other essential purposes such as shopping for necessities like food. Since January 2021, gardaÃ­ have new enforcement powers which include the right to fine people engaged in non-essential travel. Another checkpoint on Monday - this time near Drogheda Until now, Ireland's travel restrictions did not apply to people living in Northern Ireland, although Garda checkpoints a short distance from the border during earlier lockdowns did cause sometailbacks for cross-border traffic. The new cross-border fines follow recent amendments to the Irish government's Covid-19 health legislation. The regulations now state that ""any other person who is not ordinarily resident in the state shall not travel within a relevant geographical location without reasonable excuse"". GardaÃ­ said if they stop a car with a driver and two adults who should not be crossing the border, all three will receive a â¬100 fine.  Cyclists and pedestrians will also be liable for fines. ""Travelling to an airport or port to take a holiday abroad is not an essential journey,"" they also warned. Any adult who is detected travelling to an Irish airport or port for a non-essential trip or holiday abroad currently faces a â¬500 fine. A Garda spokeswoman confirmed holidaymakers from Northern Ireland who are stopped by gardaÃ on their way to an airport will be liable for both that â¬500 fine and the â¬100 cross-border fine.

"There have been almost 200,000 Covid-19 cases in Wales since the start of the pandemic The number of deaths from coronavirus reported to Public Health Wales (PHW) has gone past 5,000. A further 12 people have died in Wales with Covid, taking the total to 5,001. Health Minister Vaughan Gething has apologised for ""every single life that has been lost"" during the pandemic. ""Today we reached a sobering milestone,"" said Dr Giri Shankar, Covid incident director for PHW. ""That's one life lost every 90 minutes since March last year. 5,000 families grieving."" It comes on the same day as it is confirmed thatmore than 600,000 people in Wales- 19.2% of the Welsh population - have had their first dose of the coronavirus vaccine. Your tributes to those lost to Covid in Wales Booster jab 'may be needed to tackle variants' Widow's plea to BAME communities to have vaccine The PHW reports deaths that are confirmed cases in hospitals and some care homes. The number who have died with Covid when the virus is either suspected or confirmed by doctors, in all settings, is nearly 6,500. ""I'm deeply sorry for every single life that's been lost. Every family that's been affected,"" said Mr Gething. He said those that died were not ""just numbers"", adding: ""These are people who are loved and valued and leave others behind."" He said there was no ""good"" or ""bad"" figure for the numbers of deaths from the pandemic. He added: ""I'm afraid we can be terribly confident that without the measures that we've all taken together, more people would have come to harm, and more families would be grieving the loss of a loved one."" Dr Shankar urged everyone ""whatever their background, socio-demographic and ethnicity"" to have the vaccine when offered it. Vaughan Gething says it's difficult to talk about ""good"" and ""bad"" death figures in this pandemic. Many people might question the latter point. It's true that counting Covid deaths is not straightforward. Different organisations use different measures and therefore produce different figures. But of today's tragic milestone, more than two-thirds of the 5,001 deaths have occurred since September. International comparisons are difficult too, but nevertheless Wales - and the rest of the UK - has one of the highest excess death tolls in the world. There will be a large variety of possible explanations for this, from investment in health systems, to the rapidity of test and trace and the timings of lockdowns. But with elections across Britain scheduled for May, a dispassionate excavation of the data and the impact of decision making by governments will likely have to wait for the public inquiry. The worst day for Covid deaths in Wales during the whole pandemic was in January - theworst week was also last month- and the highest 13 days of coronavirus deaths reported by PHW have all occurred since mid-December. Hospital admissions involving coronavirus and Covid patients in critical care were at record levels in January - but now they are at their lowest since 28 December, at 2,261 inpatients. Wales' case rate of 116 cases per 100,000 people is the lowest in the UK and the lowest since 6 October. Mr Gething denied the Welsh Government had been naive about the risks at the start of the pandemic. This video can not be played Wales' health minister says those who have died with Covid are not ""just numbers"" He said there were ""different risks to the UK and to Wales at that point in time"". But he added ministers had ""never said"" that if coronavirus ""arrived at our shores in larger numbers then there wouldn't be harm caused - far from it"". Mr Gething said preparations had changed as more information came to light and that the ""reasonable worst case scenario"" in their plans talked about hundreds of thousands of deaths across the UK and ""nearly 26,000 deaths in Wales"". Q&A: What are Wales' lockdown rules? When, where and how will I get my Covid vaccine? Figuring out the stats on coronavirus in Wales Mr Gething said he had warned ministers at the time that ""individual burial may no longer be possible"" but said ""we haven't reached that scenario in reality"". But he said those plans ""show how much worse this could have been"". Welsh Conservative leader in the Senedd Andrew RT Davies called the 5,000 deaths a ""grim milestone"", adding: ""We must never forget the impact on them and their loved ones."" He said the ""consistency around the messaging"" was something that he regretted and it wasn't ""clear and loud enough right the way through the pandemic"", with some confused by ""unnecessary divergences"" between governments. This video can not be played Watch how the Covid-19 map of Wales has changed as case rates have eased since Christmas Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price said the Welsh Government should have gone into lockdown ""harder and earlier"" in March 2020. However he praised the government and all those involved in the vaccination programme for the ""fantastic"" improvement in the vaccination rate. The health minister acknowledged, in hindsight earlier this month, thatmore lives could have been saved had Wales gone into lockdown earlierat the start of the coronavirus pandemic. Office for National Statistics (ONS) figuresinclude all deaths registered, when the virus is suspected or confirmed- and in all settings from hospitals to people's homes. Public Health Wales figures just show hospital and care home deaths with Covid, when cases have been confirmed by a lab test. Under the ONS figures,Wales passed 5,000 deaths a month ago. It is estimated that for 90% of these deaths in Wales, Covid is the underlying cause not just a contributory factor. This video can not be played The different measures for looking at deaths involving Covid-19 in Wales The ONS death toll - up to 22 January - was 6,473, with updated figures due out on Tuesday. Of the deaths reported to Public Health Wales on Monday, four more were in the Betsi Cadwaladr health board area in north Wales, three were in Hywel Dda in west Wales, two each were in Cwm Taf Morgannwg and Aneurin Bevan in south Wales while one death was in Swansea Bay. There were also 610 new Covid infections reported in the last 24 hour period, taking the total number of cases to 196,670. More than 600,000 people have now received their first dose of the coronavirus vaccine in Wales - with 603,976 people now having had the jab. Of those, 2,792 have had a second dose. Figuring out the stats on coronavirus in Wales How many people have been vaccinated in Wales? How many coronavirus cases in the UK? The case rate in Wales has fallen to 116 per 100,000 people, the lowest it has been for four months. Flintshire has overtaken its neighbouring county Wrexham as the area with the highest case rate with 231.9 per 100,000 people. Wrexham's rate now stands at 229.5. The areas with the lowest case rate are Ceredigion with 56.4 per 100,000 people, followed by Pembrokeshire with 69.9 and Swansea with 70. Since the start of the pandemic 1,559,030  people have been tested for Covid-19 in Wales, with more than 2.5 million tests carried out. On Sunday 11,013 new tests were performed.

"Elon Musk's car firm Tesla has said it bought about $1.5bn (Â£1.1bn) of the cryptocurrency Bitcoin in January and expects to start accepting it as payment in future. The news caused the price of Bitcoin to jump 17% to $44,220, a record high. Tesla said it was trying to maximise returns on cash that is not being used in day-to-day running of the company. It comes days after Mr Musk added ""#bitcoin"" to his Twitter profile page, which drove up the price. He removed it days later, but has continued talking up Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, including Dogecoin, which jumped 50% after his endorsement. Dogecoin takes off after tip by Elon Musk Bitcoin tops $34,000 as record rally continues In a stock market filing, Tesla said it ""updated its investment policy"" in January and now wanted to invest in ""reserve assets"" such as digital currencies, gold bullion or gold exchange-traded funds. It said it had already bought $1.5bn of Bitcoin and could ""acquire and hold digital assets"" in the future. ""Moreover, we expect to begin accepting Bitcoin as a form of payment for our products in the near future, subject to applicable laws and initially on a limited basis,"" it said. Mr Musk said a week ago in a tweet that Bitcoin was ""on the verge"" of being more widely accepted among investors. Some analysts said Tesla's investment could be a game-changer for the cryptocurrency. ""I think we will see an acceleration of companies looking to allocate to Bitcoin now that Tesla has made the first move,"" said Eric Turner, vice-president of market intelligence at cryptocurrency research firm Messari. ""One of the largest companies in the world now owns Bitcoin and by extension, every investor that owns Tesla, or even just an S&P 500 fund, has exposure to it as well."" But Neil Wilson, chief market analyst for Markets.com, warned that Bitcoin was a ""very volatile"" cryptocurrency. ""Tesla is now starting to take on big [foreign exchange] risk - this may not worry a lot of investors, but some conservative types might be concerned,"" he said. Bitcoin, which has hit record highs in recent months after a rollercoaster ride over the past decade, has also drawn support from major financial institutions this year. The world's biggest money manager, Blackrock, recently changed a handful of investment mandates to allow some of its funds to invest in the currency. However, central banks remain sceptical of digital currencies. In October, Bank of England governor Andrew Bailey cautioned over Bitcoin's use as a payment method. ""I have to be honest, it is hard to see that Bitcoin has what we tend to call intrinsic value,"" he said. ""It may have extrinsic value in the sense that people want it."" Mr Bailey added that he was ""very nervous"" about people using Bitcoin for payments, pointing out that investors should realise its price was extremely volatile.

The Grand Slam has only been possible after all international competitors were put into a 14-day quarantine. But this â and the way Australia has managed to control the virus in recent months â means that tens of thousands of tennis fans are allowed in each day to watch. The BBCâs Australia correspondent Shaimaa Khalil has been finding out how those spectators are being kept safe.

where â and when â you can get vaccinated in the UK. Links to the NHS info will be added to Facebookâs dedicated
Covid-19 Information Centre â a prominent tab on both the app and website. The tech giant says it wants to help people understand
whether theyâre eligible for a vaccine and how to go about it. Itâs part of the companyâs bigger campaign to present itself
as running âthe largest worldwide campaign promoting
authoritative Covid vaccine informationâ â after facingwidespread criticism last year about Covid misinformation on the platform. Facebook has also announced a

Sterile gowns were bought for Â£70m from a US firm last year, but safety concerns were raised when they arrived in one layer of protective packaging. The contract had not requested double packaging, as used in sterile settings. A court document obtained by the BBC shows NHS infection control experts were concerned the gowns were only single wrapped.

Ron Wright is the first sitting member of Congress to die with Covid-19 US Republican congressman Ron Wright has died aged 67 after testing positive for Covid-19 - the first sitting member of Congress to die with the disease. The Texas lawmaker ""passed away peacefully"" with his wife Susan by his side on Sunday, his office said in a statement. The couple had both been infected with the virus and were receiving treatment at Baylor Hospital in Dallas. Mr Wright, who was elected to the House of Representatives in 2018 and had also been battling cancer in recent years, announced he had contracted the virus on 21 January. Announcing his death on Monday, his office said: ""Despite years of painful, sometimes debilitating treatment for cancer, Ron never lacked the desire to get up and go to work, to motivate those around him, or to offer fatherly advice.""

Cheryl Saunders, from Abercarn in Caerphilly county, spent her whole 40-year career working in the NHS as a medical secretary in respiratory medicine, first in Caerphilly Miners' Hospital and later at Ysbyty Ystrad Fawr in nearby Ystrad Mynach. She still worked in respiratory medicine at the start of the pandemic but was forced to stop working in the summer after being diagnosed with advanced metastatic renal - or kidney - cancer. The mother-of-two and grandmother to twin three-year-old girls tested positive for coronavirus while in hospital and died, where she worked, at Ysbyty Ystrad Fawr, on 27 October 2020, at the age of 62.

Mexican President AndrÃ©s Manuel LÃ³pez Obrador has held his first public briefing since testing positive for the virus last month, saying he has now recovered from Covid-19. The left-wing leader, a 64-year-old with a history of heart problems, announced on 24 January that he was undergoing treatment for the coronavirus. But last week LÃ³pez Obrador said he had tested negative for Covid-19 after two weeks in isolation. âI thank all Mexicans, men and women, who worried about my illness because of my Covid infection. Fortunately I got through it,â he told reporters at the National Palace. âWe are back on our feet and fighting.â Government updates on LÃ³pez Obradorâs condition said he had experienced mild symptoms, including a low-grade fever and a slight headache. LÃ³pez Obrador is among several world leaders to have received treatment for coronavirus infections. UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson and former US President Donald Trump were both admitted to hospital with the disease last year. Introducing mandatory quarantines at the border is the best way to guard against new coronavirus variants, Labour's shadow health minister says. Speaking to BBC News after today's Downing Street briefing, Alex Norris says he was ""cheered"" to hear the latest vaccine take-up figures. But says he was surprised that quarantines were not discussed at the briefing. He says the government needs to ""quicken up"" the introduction of the measure. ""The best way to guard against new [variants] is by having quarantines,"" he says.

Jonathan Brown spent four hours in his garden near Stowmarket in Suffolk  sculpting a Covid-19 vaccination scene out of snow to encourage people to have the jab. He hoped that sharing it on social media it would help people ""tolerate"" the lockdown restrictions and stay optimistic. ""We just need to be patient and I was hoping to highlight the light at the end of the tunnel,"" he said. Snowfall has been so heavy, a number ofvaccination centres in the county closedon Sunday and Monday. Health secretary Matt Hancock has just been giving a Downing Street coronavirus briefing. It was mostly about vaccines and variants, hereâs what we
learnt: Â· Alex Rogers from MyLondon and Yorkshire Live is the final journalist on today's briefing, and asks if Early Years childcare workers will soon be eligible to get free and regular Covid tests. Hancock says yes, such tests will be available as part ofplans allowing businesses with more than 50 employees to access lateral flow tests, which can produce results in less than 30 minutes. Previously only firms with more than 250 staff qualified for testing. ""We'll set out details in due course,"" Hancock adds. That brings an end to the news conference. The next question comes from the Guardian about international travel. Should people be prepared for tougher restrictions on travel until there is widespread vaccination? Matt Hancock says: ""The proportion of cases coming from abroad at the moment is obviously very low, not least because it's currently illegal to go on holiday anyway. ""Of course we want to lift these measures... as soon is safely possible. ""But until we know, we need to know more about the impact of the vaccines on all these different variants and therefore for now, the precautionary principle is the right approach."" Prof Van-Tam is asked whether it is too early to book summer holidays in the UK. ""Thanks for the question and I can't answer it. I think it's just too early to say,"" he replies. ""We don't yet have the read-outs on the success of the vaccine programme although I expect we'll start to see these in one to two weeks."" ""The more elaborate your plans are for the summer holidays in terms of crossing borders, in terms of household mixing, given where we are now, I think we just have to say, the more you're stepping into making guesses about the unknown at this point. ""I can't give people a proper answer at this point. We don't yet have the data, it's just too early."" Â© 2025 BBC.

"The EU's threat to restrict vaccine exports to Northern Ireland has opened a ""Pandora's Box"" regarding post-Brexit arrangements, Michael Gove has said. He told MPs an urgent ""reset"" was needed to the Northern Ireland protocol governing checks on GB-NI trade. The agreement was ""not working"" and NI businesses and families were suffering too much ""disruption and interference"". While the UK did not want to ""ditch"" it, it ""reserved the right"" to do what it must to protect Northern Ireland. Unionist parties in Northern Ireland have called for the protocol - which came into force on 1 January - to be scrapped, saying it has created a border down the Irish Sea and threatened NI's place within the UK. What is the Northern Ireland Protocol? Cheese wholesaler 'gives up on Ireland' The protocol was designed to avoid checks along the border between Northern Ireland - which unlike the rest of the UK is continuing to follow many of the EU's rules - and the Republic of Ireland, a member of the EU. But after checks were introduced on goods arriving in Northern Ireland from Great Britain, some exporters have scaled back deliveries or stopped fulfilling orders altogether, blaming the additional paperwork and costs involved. And following last month's vaccine row, graffiti opposing the Irish Sea border appeared in some loyalist areas of Northern Ireland, while some staff involved in inspecting goods were stood down over security fears. Cabinet Office minister Mr Gove said the EU's threat to invoke Article 16 of the protocol to control shipments of vaccines from the continent to Northern Ireland - amid concerns of a shortage in Europe - had been a mistake. The European Commission, he said, owed its members an explanation why it didn't follow the dispute mechanism procedures in the protocol and consult with other member states, particularly Ireland, before acting. Asked by Tory MP David Jones whether the ""bad blood"" between the two sides would cause long-term damage, Mr Gove said it would be ""better"" if the EU revoked the regulation in place allowing it to invoke Article 16 in future. ""The Pandora's Box has been opened and that is concerning,"" he told the European Scrutiny Committee. ""One of the consequences of opening that Pandora's Box has been the unfortunate effects we referred to on the ground in Northern Ireland."" Asked by a number of Conservative MPs whether the EU's actions were a reasonable cause for the UK to seek to suspend the protocol or to axe it entirely, Mr Gove said while it was not functioning smoothly, it could be ""made to work"". While he said progress in the Joint EU-UK Committee on the protocol's implementation had not been as fast as he had liked, he hoped for better in talks with his EU counterpart Maros Sefcovic in London on Thursday. ""There are disruptions and difficulties faced by Northern Ireland citizens in their daily lives,"" he said. ""They can be resolved within the context of the protocol. We don't need to ditch it. ""But as the prime minister has spelt out, if we can't make progress in resolving those issues, then the UK government has to reserve its rights.""

Mexican President AndrÃ©s Manuel LÃ³pez Obrador has held his first public briefing since testing positive for the virus last month, saying he has now recovered from Covid-19. The left-wing leader, a 64-year-old with a history of heart problems, announced on 24 January that he was undergoing treatment for the coronavirus. But last week LÃ³pez Obrador said he had tested negative for Covid-19 after two weeks in isolation. âI thank all Mexicans, men and women, who worried about my illness because of my Covid infection. Fortunately I got through it,â he told reporters at the National Palace. âWe are back on our feet and fighting.â Government updates on LÃ³pez Obradorâs condition said he had experienced mild symptoms, including a low-grade fever and a slight headache. LÃ³pez Obrador is among several world leaders to have received treatment for coronavirus infections. UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson and former US President Donald Trump were both admitted to hospital with the disease last year. Introducing mandatory quarantines at the border is the best way to guard against new coronavirus variants, Labour's shadow health minister says. Speaking to BBC News after today's Downing Street briefing, Alex Norris says he was ""cheered"" to hear the latest vaccine take-up figures.

Previously only firms with more than 250 staff qualified for testing. ""We'll set out details in due course,"" Hancock adds. That brings an end to the news conference. The next question comes from the Guardian about international travel. Should people be prepared for tougher restrictions on travel until there is widespread vaccination? Matt Hancock says: ""The proportion of cases coming from abroad at the moment is obviously very low, not least because it's currently illegal to go on holiday anyway. ""Of course we want to lift these measures... as soon is safely possible. ""But until we know, we need to know more about the impact of the vaccines on all these different variants and therefore for now, the precautionary principle is the right approach.""

"A snow plough on the A66 near Bowes in County Durham where the road was closed due to heavy snow Heavy snow and ice has brought disruption to parts of the UK, withcoronavirus vaccination centres and schools shuttingin some areas. Yellow warnings for snow cover much of England and Scotland, as well as parts of Northern Ireland until Wednesday. Police have warned people not to travel, with long delays expected and road closures in some parts. On Monday, 30cm (12in) of snow fell in Aboyne, Aberdeenshire, while up to 22cm fell in parts of the east of England. Heavy snowfall and temperatures as low as -15C have been forecast for parts of Scotland, withthe Met Office issuing an amber warning for snow,externalfor areas including Perthshire, Stirlingshire and Fife from 03:00 to 21:00 on Tuesday. Further south temperatures could get as low as -10C, BBC Weather's Billy Payne said, in what he described as the most significant cold spell since the Beast from the East three years ago.

"Online fashion retailer Boohoo has bought the Dorothy Perkins, Wallis and Burton brands from failed retail group Arcadia for Â£25.2m The deal includes the brands and online businesses, but not the 214 shops nor 2,450 workers employed in them. It completes the sell-off of Sir Philip Green's once mighty Arcadia group which fell into administration last year. Last week, rival Asos bought Arcadia's other leading brands, Topshop, Topman, Miss Selfridge and HIIT. The Arcadia businesses employed 13,000, a fraction of which will carry on into employment with the new owners. Dorothy Perkins? Why would Boohoo want that? Boohoo tells suppliers to bring work in-house 'I haven't bought clothes in a shop for years' Administrators Deloitte, which has been conducting the sales, said around 2,450 staff would lose their jobs as a result of the Dorothy Perkins, Wallis and Burton sale, and the stores would permanently close. Deloitte said staff had been emailed on Monday and would informed over the course of the day. Approximately 260 jobs will be moving with the brands to Boohoo, mainly head office functions such as brand design, buying and merchandising, and the digital part of the business. Last month, Boohoo bought the Debenhams brand and website for Â£55m. Boohoo said the brands it had bought from Arcadia had two million active customers last year, and added that the deal would give it a significant opportunity to boost its share of the market across a broader group of customers. It also said that buying Burton would improve its range of menswear. ""Acquiring these well-known brands in British fashion out of administration ensures their heritage is sustained, while our investment aims to transform them into brands that are fit for the current market environment,"" said chief executive John Lyttle. ""We have a successful track record of integrating British heritage fashion brands onto our proven multi-brand platform, and we are looking forward to bringing these brands on board."" The debate around the economic recovery from the coronavirus pandemic has shifted subtly in recent weeks from the size and speed of the bounce back to its nature. What parts of pre-pandemic life will return, and which, given the virus is mutating quickly and may turn out to be a long-lasting threat, are gone forever? The debate is already closed in one part of retail, clothing sales. The pandemic has accounted for several big High Street names, and this morning Boohoo bought three more stalwarts - Dorothy Perkins, Burton and Wallis. The names will live on online, but their 214 UK shops will close, with about 2,450 staff losing their jobs. Hundreds more stores that were under the other Arcadia brands - notably Topshop - will also close after the brands were bought by another online player Asos. And Boohoo has already bought the Debenhams name, meaning 125 of its stores will close from next month. This leaves a big hole on British high streets, one that will take a long time to be filled. Councils must now think how they can revitalise their high streets. Should they stick to Plan A and try and lure more retailers to fill the vacant shops, or be more radical, and use this sudden shift in the market as a catalyst for wholesale reinvention? In Stockton-on-Tees a 1970s shopping centre will be bulldozed next year to make way for a park. It may not be the last one to bite the dust. Boohoo has bought a number of other leading High Street names in the past two years, buying the online businesses of Oasis and Warehouse for Â£5.25m last year. That added to its portfolio, which included the Karen Millen and Coast brands, which it bought from administrators in 2019. Susannah Streeter, markets analyst at stockbrokers Hargreaves Lansdown, said the sale of the final assets of the former Arcadia empire gave Boohoo the parts with which to build its own: ""This purchase is part of a grand master plan by Boohoo to become the UK's largest retail marketplace and propel its international expansion. ""As Boohoo expands, the final bricks of Sir Philip Green's retail empire have been dislodged. Boohoo and Asos, dismissed as digital upstarts a decade ago are now the great disruptors in fashion, reaching the top branches of the retail tree.''

""Did you see how many people died yesterday?"" the officer said. The pair were each given fines of Â£200 after they admitted driving from West Bridgford in Nottingham to near East Midlands Airport. Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent News the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccinehas only a limited effect against the South African variant of coronavirus has caused understandable concern. It is the vaccine many people in the UK are being given and scientists have warned the variant ispresent in the country. Viruses mutate - so what is happening is not surprising. As more people build up immunity - either through vaccination or exposure to the virus - there is going to be more pressure on the virus to change in ways that allow it to escape human defences. An important thing to remember is the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine remains highly effective against the type of virus dominant in the UK. The same is also true for the Pfizer-BioNTech jab, which is also being used in the UK. Read more from Nickhere. The coronavirus variant that was first identified in the south-east of the UK is now spreading through the US, according to a new study. The strain - which is more contagious - is nearly doubling its prevalence among confirmed cases in the US every nine days. Case numbers of the new variant are still somewhat small in the US - but the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has predicted it could be the predominant strain by March. The report has not yet been peer-reviewed or published in a journal. Read the full story here.

Here are our top headlines: This video can not be played Bodycam footage has been released showing the moment a police officer confronted two people who said they had driven about 13 miles to watch planes during lockdown. The Leicestershire Police officer told the pair his partner - a healthcare assistant who works in a hospital - had been ""in tears for two weeks because she honestly cannot watch people die any more"". ""Did you see how many people died yesterday?"" the officer said. The pair were each given fines of Â£200 after they admitted driving from West Bridgford in Nottingham to near East Midlands Airport. Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent News the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccinehas only a limited effect against the South African variant of coronavirus has caused understandable concern. It is the vaccine many people in the UK are being given and scientists have warned the variant ispresent in the country. Viruses mutate - so what is happening is not surprising. As more people build up immunity - either through vaccination or exposure to the virus - there is going to be more pressure on the virus to change in ways that allow it to escape human defences. An important thing to remember is the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine remains highly effective against the type of virus dominant in the UK. The same is also true for the Pfizer-BioNTech jab, which is also being used in the UK. Read more from Nickhere. The coronavirus variant that was first identified in the south-east of the UK is now spreading through the US, according to a new study. The strain - which is more contagious - is nearly doubling its prevalence among confirmed cases in the US every nine days. Case numbers of the new variant are still somewhat small in the US - but the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has predicted it could be the predominant strain by March. The report has not yet been peer-reviewed or published in a journal. Read the full story here.

The Grand Slam has only been possible after all international competitors were put into a 14-day quarantine. But this â and the way Australia has managed to control the virus in recent months â means that tens of thousands of tennis fans are allowed in each day to watch. The BBCâs Australia correspondent Shaimaa Khalil has been finding out how those spectators are being kept safe. David MolloyTechnology reporter Facebook has announced itâs adding information about
where â and when â you can get vaccinated in the UK. Links to the NHS info will be added to Facebookâs dedicated
Covid-19 Information Centre â a prominent tab on both the app and website. The tech giant says it wants to help people understand
whether theyâre eligible for a vaccine and how to go about it. Itâs part of the companyâs bigger campaign to present itself
as running âthe largest worldwide campaign promoting
authoritative Covid vaccine informationâ â after facingwidespread criticism last year about Covid misinformation on the platform. Facebook has also announced a
tightening of its rules about false Covid posts â banning claims that:  Facebook
is also giving free ads to the NHS â a share of a $120m (Â£88m) global fund -
which it says will help the NHS reach of tens of millions of people with

BBC File on 4 The use of 10 million surgical gowns, bought by the UK government, has been suspended for frontline NHS staff because of how the items were packaged,a BBC File on 4 investigation has found. Sterile gowns were bought for Â£70m from a US firm last year, but safety concerns were raised when they arrived in one layer of protective packaging. The contract had not requested double packaging, as used in sterile settings. A court document obtained by the BBC shows NHS infection control experts were concerned the gowns were only single wrapped. The government says all PPE is quality assured, but Labour has called for an inquiry into the awarding of contracts.

Mexican President AndrÃ©s Manuel LÃ³pez Obrador has held his first public briefing since testing positive for the virus last month, saying he has now recovered from Covid-19. The left-wing leader, a 64-year-old with a history of heart problems, announced on 24 January that he was undergoing treatment for the coronavirus. But last week LÃ³pez Obrador said he had tested negative for Covid-19 after two weeks in isolation. âI thank all Mexicans, men and women, who worried about my illness because of my Covid infection. Fortunately I got through it,â he told reporters at the National Palace. âWe are back on our feet and fighting.â Government updates on LÃ³pez Obradorâs condition said he had experienced mild symptoms, including a low-grade fever and a slight headache. LÃ³pez Obrador is among several world leaders to have received treatment for coronavirus infections. UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson and former US President Donald Trump were both admitted to hospital with the disease last year. Introducing mandatory quarantines at the border is the best way to guard against new coronavirus variants, Labour's shadow health minister says. Speaking to BBC News after today's Downing Street briefing, Alex Norris says he was ""cheered"" to hear the latest vaccine take-up figures. But says he was surprised that quarantines were not discussed at the briefing. He says the government needs to ""quicken up"" the introduction of the measure. ""The best way to guard against new [variants] is by having quarantines,"" he says.

He hoped that sharing it on social media it would help people ""tolerate"" the lockdown restrictions and stay optimistic.

"Britney Spears has had hits with tracks like Toxic, Oops! I Did it Again, and Baby One More Time Britney Spears has said she is ""taking the time to learn and be a normal person"" after a new documentary reopened the debate around her life, career and mental health. Framing Britney Spears, which aired this week in the US, details the singer's public breakdown in 2007. It explores the media treatment of the US pop star and her legal arrangements. Spears' career remains on hold while she tries to remove her father Jamie from his role as her conservator. On Tuesday, she shared a video of her performing one of her hits, Toxic, three years ago,alongside a message,externalto her 27 million followers. ""I'll always love being on stage,"" wrote the 39-year-old. ""But I am taking the time to learn and be a normal person. I love simply enjoying the basics of everyday life!"" She added: ""Each person has their story and their take on other people's stories! We all have so many different bright beautiful lives. The documentary has renewed interest in how Spears has been treated throughout her career ""Remember, no matter what we think we know about a person's life it is nothing compared to the actual person living behind the lens."" The singer's boyfriend Sam Asghari, meanwhile, has publicly criticised her father online. ""It's important for people to understand that I have zero respect for someone trying to control our relationship and constantly throwing obstacles our way,"" he posted on Instagram. The new messages come after critics and fans alike welcomed the aforementioned documentary. Produced by The New York Times, the film charts the singer's rise to fame and the controversy over her welfare. Britney's father Jamie Spears has been her conservator for 12 years, due to concerns about her mental health. It's an arrangement that is usually granted for people who are unable to make their own decisions, like those with dementia or other mental illnesses, and means he has ultimate control over her finances and many of her career choices. ""The documentary adds to the critical conversation we are having about women, agency and trauma,""wrote NBC's Patricia Grisafi,external. ""In the tradition of so many 'madwomen in the attic' stories before her, Framing Britney Spears asks what happens when the door is opened to reveal not a frothing hag but hints of a quirky, completely competent human who benefits from meaningful work, time with her children and an Instagram account."" In November, Spears lost a legal attempt to remove her father's control over her estate. Fans take part in a #FreeBritney protest in Orlando in December The legal battle has been played out against the backdrop of the #FreeBritney movement, led by fans who believe Spears is being controlled against her will. Mr Spears has defended his role,telling CNNhe is ""protecting"" his daughter from ""those with self-serving interests and those who seek to harm her"". The documentary examines not only the complex history behind the long-running conservatorship, but also the treatment of Spears as she grew up in the spotlight. Many fans welcomed the documentary as further evidence of how the singer has been treated over the years, while some celebrities spoke out in support. Actresses Sarah Jessica Parker and Bette Midler posted the #FreeBritney slogan, and Miley Cyrus used a pre-Super Bowl performance to tell the audience: ""We love Britney!"" Allow Twitter content?

Entertainment Weekly's Mary Sollosi,externalpointed out that ""too much information has been obscured by the parties involved for the documentary to come to a concrete conclusion about the truth of Spears' current mental, legal, or financial circumstances"". But she said that ""after seeing the facts play out with the benefit of hindsight and context, it's hard to step away from Framing Britney Spears believing she hasn't been repeatedly wronged"". Variety's Daniel D'Addario,externalsaid Framing Britney Spears ""comes to no conclusions"" but raises ""the idea that Spears may indeed be grateful for the ministrations of her fans online"". CNN's Brian Lowry agreed, writing,external: ""Framing Britney Spears doesn't really penetrate that protective shell, but it does meticulously lay out the history and key players, as well as the way the conversation about her status has grown to encompass issues beyond just the particulars of Spears' story. ""The more uncomfortable, slightly meta question is whether even serious attempts to examine the star's fame and potential exploitation wind up participating in the process."" The film examines old footage such as an interview with her ex-boyfriend Justin Timberlake, a game show making fun of her breakdown and her appearance as a child on a TV talent show. In the Los Angeles Times, Meredith Blake wrote,external: ""Applying the rigour of a Frontline episode to a narrative that has been shaped by thinly sourced gossip and anonymous hearsay, Framing Britney Spears is also a pointed work of cultural criticism that might make some viewers feel guilt about idly gawking at pictures of Spears on Perez Hilton circa 2007. ""Framing Britney Spears is the latest project to reconsider women once ridiculed and reviled because of their role in salacious scandals, such as Monica Lewinsky, Lorena Bobbitt and Paris Hilton. It asks us to ponder our collective complicity in the mockery and sexist criticism to which Spears has been subjected.""

"The teenager previously admitted 12 terror offences at the Old Bailey A teenager who is the youngest person in the UK to commit a terror offence has been given a two-year youth rehabilitation order. The 16-year-old boy from Cornwall admitted 12 offences including downloading a bomb-making manual. At the Old Bailey, Judge Mark Dennis QC said a custodial sentence would ""undo"" the progress made since the boy was arrested in July 2019. The teenager, who cannot be named, had ""significant vulnerabilities"", he said. The boy collected far right material and expressed racist, homophobic and anti-Semitic views on online platforms between 2018 and July 2019, the court heard. He became the leader of the British arm of a now banned neo-Nazi terrorist organisation called Feuerkrieg Division. Working from his grandmother's house, he recruited members online such as Paul Dunleavy, a teenager from Rugby,who was jailed last year for preparing a terrorist attack. The group wanted to enact ""white jihad"" and the genocide of non-white people, the court heard. The judge said the boy had entered an ""online world of wicked prejudice and violent bigotry"". He said that a custodial sentence caused ""irreversible harm for the future"" and that public safety required the boy's rehabilitation. The judge said the teenager had ""significant vulnerabilities"" stemming from an ""abnormal childhood"". Paul Dunleavy was jailed for five years and six months, after a trial at Birmingham Crown Court The defendant first joined the neo-Nazi forum Fascist Forge in 2018, having downloaded his first bomb-making manual that year when he was 13. He first came to the attention of police in July 2019 after detectives received information he was constructing a weapon. When the home where he lived with his grandmother was searched, officers found a Nazi flag and a racist slogan painted on the garden shed. The teenager appeared at court on bail by video link from Bodmin Magistrates' Court, sitting next to his grandmother. Jenny Hopkins, from the Crown Prosecution Service, said after the case that people would ""rightly be disturbed that a 13-year-old should hold the most appalling neo-Nazi beliefs"". The boy ""claimed not to have racist views and just wanted to appear cool"", she said, but the ""body of evidence led to him pleading guilty to possession and dissemination of terrorist material"". Det Insp Mark Samuel, of Counter Terrorism Policing South West, said the case was a ""timely reminder of potential extremism"" online. He said the ""risk for the young and vulnerable"" was ""especially true during lockdown where young people spend more time online, often alone and unsupervised"".

The Leicestershire Police officer told the pair his partner - a healthcare assistant who works in a hospital - had been ""in tears for two weeks because she honestly cannot watch people die any more"". ""Did you see how many people died yesterday?"" the officer said. The pair were each given fines of Â£200 after they admitted driving from West Bridgford in Nottingham to near East Midlands Airport. Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent News the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccinehas only a limited effect against the South African variant of coronavirus has caused understandable concern. It is the vaccine many people in the UK are being given and scientists have warned the variant ispresent in the country. Viruses mutate - so what is happening is not surprising. As more people build up immunity - either through vaccination or exposure to the virus - there is going to be more pressure on the virus to change in ways that allow it to escape human defences. An important thing to remember is the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine remains highly effective against the type of virus dominant in the UK. The same is also true for the Pfizer-BioNTech jab, which is also being used in the UK. Read more from Nickhere. The coronavirus variant that was first identified in the south-east of the UK is now spreading through the US, according to a new study. The strain - which is more contagious - is nearly doubling its prevalence among confirmed cases in the US every nine days. Case numbers of the new variant are still somewhat small in the US - but the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has predicted it could be the predominant strain by March. The report has not yet been peer-reviewed or published in a journal. Read the full story here.

The Grand Slam has only been possible after all international competitors were put into a 14-day quarantine. But this â and the way Australia has managed to control the virus in recent months â means that tens of thousands of tennis fans are allowed in each day to watch. The BBCâs Australia correspondent Shaimaa Khalil has been finding out how those spectators are being kept safe. David MolloyTechnology reporter Facebook has announced itâs adding information about
where â and when â you can get vaccinated in the UK. Links to the NHS info will be added to Facebookâs dedicated
Covid-19 Information Centre â a prominent tab on both the app and website. The tech giant says it wants to help people understand
whether theyâre eligible for a vaccine and how to go about it. Itâs part of the companyâs bigger campaign to present itself
as running âthe largest worldwide campaign promoting
authoritative Covid vaccine informationâ â after facingwidespread criticism last year about Covid misinformation on the platform. Facebook has also announced a
tightening of its rules about false Covid posts â banning claims that:  Facebook
is also giving free ads to the NHS â a share of a $120m (Â£88m) global fund -
which it says will help the NHS reach of tens of millions of people with

BBC File on 4 The use of 10 million surgical gowns, bought by the UK government, has been suspended for frontline NHS staff because of how the items were packaged,a BBC File on 4 investigation has found. Sterile gowns were bought for Â£70m from a US firm last year, but safety concerns were raised when they arrived in one layer of protective packaging. The contract had not requested double packaging, as used in sterile settings. A court document obtained by the BBC shows NHS infection control experts were concerned the gowns were only single wrapped. The government says all PPE is quality assured, but Labour has called for an inquiry into the awarding of contracts.

Ron Wright is the first sitting member of Congress to die with Covid-19 US Republican congressman Ron Wright has died aged 67 after testing positive for Covid-19 - the first sitting member of Congress to die with the disease. The Texas lawmaker ""passed away peacefully"" with his wife Susan by his side on Sunday, his office said in a statement. The couple had both been infected with the virus and were receiving treatment at Baylor Hospital in Dallas. Mr Wright, who was elected to the House of Representatives in 2018 and had also been battling cancer in recent years, announced he had contracted the virus on 21 January. Announcing his death on Monday, his office said: ""Despite years of painful, sometimes debilitating treatment for cancer, Ron never lacked the desire to get up and go to work, to motivate those around him, or to offer fatherly advice."" The US is by far the world's worst-hit nation when it comes to the pandemic, with more than 463,000 coronavirus-related deaths and over 27 million cases reported.

Mexican President AndrÃ©s Manuel LÃ³pez Obrador has held his first public briefing since testing positive for the virus last month, saying he has now recovered from Covid-19. The left-wing leader, a 64-year-old with a history of heart problems, announced on 24 January that he was undergoing treatment for the coronavirus. But last week LÃ³pez Obrador said he had tested negative for Covid-19 after two weeks in isolation. âI thank all Mexicans, men and women, who worried about my illness because of my Covid infection. Fortunately I got through it,â he told reporters at the National Palace. âWe are back on our feet and fighting.â Government updates on LÃ³pez Obradorâs condition said he had experienced mild symptoms, including a low-grade fever and a slight headache. LÃ³pez Obrador is among several world leaders to have received treatment for coronavirus infections. UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson and former US President Donald Trump were both admitted to hospital with the disease last year. Introducing mandatory quarantines at the border is the best way to guard against new coronavirus variants, Labour's shadow health minister says. Speaking to BBC News after today's Downing Street briefing, Alex Norris says he was ""cheered"" to hear the latest vaccine take-up figures. But says he was surprised that quarantines were not discussed at the briefing. He says the government needs to ""quicken up"" the introduction of the measure. ""The best way to guard against new [variants] is by having quarantines,"" he says.

He hoped that sharing it on social media it would help people ""tolerate"" the lockdown restrictions and stay optimistic. ""We just need to be patient and I was hoping to highlight the light at the end of the tunnel,"" he said. Snowfall has been so heavy, a number ofvaccination centres in the county closedon Sunday and Monday. Health secretary Matt Hancock has just been giving a Downing Street coronavirus briefing. It was mostly about vaccines and variants, hereâs what we
learnt: Â· Alex Rogers from MyLondon and Yorkshire Live is the final journalist on today's briefing, and asks if Early Years childcare workers will soon be eligible to get free and regular Covid tests. Hancock says yes, such tests will be available as part ofplans allowing businesses with more than 50 employees to access lateral flow tests, which can produce results in less than 30 minutes. Previously only firms with more than 250 staff qualified for testing. ""We'll set out details in due course,"" Hancock adds. That brings an end to the news conference. The next question comes from the Guardian about international travel. Should people be prepared for tougher restrictions on travel until there is widespread vaccination? Matt Hancock says: ""The proportion of cases coming from abroad at the moment is obviously very low, not least because it's currently illegal to go on holiday anyway. ""Of course we want to lift these measures... as soon is safely possible. ""But until we know, we need to know more about the impact of the vaccines on all these different variants and therefore for now, the precautionary principle is the right approach."" Prof Van-Tam is asked whether it is too early to book summer holidays in the UK. ""Thanks for the question and I can't answer it. I think it's just too early to say,"" he replies. ""We don't yet have the read-outs on the success of the vaccine programme although I expect we'll start to see these in one to two weeks."" ""The more elaborate your plans are for the summer holidays in terms of crossing borders, in terms of household mixing, given where we are now, I think we just have to say, the more you're stepping into making guesses about the unknown at this point.

"Britney Spears has had hits with tracks like Toxic, Oops! I Did it Again, and Baby One More Time Britney Spears has said she is ""taking the time to learn and be a normal person"" after a new documentary reopened the debate around her life, career and mental health. Framing Britney Spears, which aired this week in the US, details the singer's public breakdown in 2007. It explores the media treatment of the US pop star and her legal arrangements. Spears' career remains on hold while she tries to remove her father Jamie from his role as her conservator. On Tuesday, she shared a video of her performing one of her hits, Toxic, three years ago,alongside a message,externalto her 27 million followers. ""I'll always love being on stage,"" wrote the 39-year-old. ""But I am taking the time to learn and be a normal person. I love simply enjoying the basics of everyday life!"" She added: ""Each person has their story and their take on other people's stories! We all have so many different bright beautiful lives. The documentary has renewed interest in how Spears has been treated throughout her career ""Remember, no matter what we think we know about a person's life it is nothing compared to the actual person living behind the lens."" The singer's boyfriend Sam Asghari, meanwhile, has publicly criticised her father online. ""It's important for people to understand that I have zero respect for someone trying to control our relationship and constantly throwing obstacles our way,"" he posted on Instagram. The new messages come after critics and fans alike welcomed the aforementioned documentary. Produced by The New York Times, the film charts the singer's rise to fame and the controversy over her welfare. Britney's father Jamie Spears has been her conservator for 12 years, due to concerns about her mental health. It's an arrangement that is usually granted for people who are unable to make their own decisions, like those with dementia or other mental illnesses, and means he has ultimate control over her finances and many of her career choices. ""The documentary adds to the critical conversation we are having about women, agency and trauma,""wrote NBC's Patricia Grisafi,external. ""In the tradition of so many 'madwomen in the attic' stories before her, Framing Britney Spears asks what happens when the door is opened to reveal not a frothing hag but hints of a quirky, completely competent human who benefits from meaningful work, time with her children and an Instagram account."" In November, Spears lost a legal attempt to remove her father's control over her estate. Fans take part in a #FreeBritney protest in Orlando in December The legal battle has been played out against the backdrop of the #FreeBritney movement, led by fans who believe Spears is being controlled against her will. Mr Spears has defended his role,telling CNNhe is ""protecting"" his daughter from ""those with self-serving interests and those who seek to harm her"". The documentary examines not only the complex history behind the long-running conservatorship, but also the treatment of Spears as she grew up in the spotlight. Many fans welcomed the documentary as further evidence of how the singer has been treated over the years, while some celebrities spoke out in support. Actresses Sarah Jessica Parker and Bette Midler posted the #FreeBritney slogan, and Miley Cyrus used a pre-Super Bowl performance to tell the audience: ""We love Britney!"" Allow Twitter content?

Entertainment Weekly's Mary Sollosi,externalpointed out that ""too much information has been obscured by the parties involved for the documentary to come to a concrete conclusion about the truth of Spears' current mental, legal, or financial circumstances"". But she said that ""after seeing the facts play out with the benefit of hindsight and context, it's hard to step away from Framing Britney Spears believing she hasn't been repeatedly wronged"". Variety's Daniel D'Addario,externalsaid Framing Britney Spears ""comes to no conclusions"" but raises ""the idea that Spears may indeed be grateful for the ministrations of her fans online"". CNN's Brian Lowry agreed, writing,external: ""Framing Britney Spears doesn't really penetrate that protective shell, but it does meticulously lay out the history and key players, as well as the way the conversation about her status has grown to encompass issues beyond just the particulars of Spears' story. ""The more uncomfortable, slightly meta question is whether even serious attempts to examine the star's fame and potential exploitation wind up participating in the process."" The film examines old footage such as an interview with her ex-boyfriend Justin Timberlake, a game show making fun of her breakdown and her appearance as a child on a TV talent show. In the Los Angeles Times, Meredith Blake wrote,external: ""Applying the rigour of a Frontline episode to a narrative that has been shaped by thinly sourced gossip and anonymous hearsay, Framing Britney Spears is also a pointed work of cultural criticism that might make some viewers feel guilt about idly gawking at pictures of Spears on Perez Hilton circa 2007. ""Framing Britney Spears is the latest project to reconsider women once ridiculed and reviled because of their role in salacious scandals, such as Monica Lewinsky, Lorena Bobbitt and Paris Hilton. It asks us to ponder our collective complicity in the mockery and sexist criticism to which Spears has been subjected.""

"Check Point said spyware was hidden in restaurant and wallpaper apps, among others Iran is running two surveillance operations in cyber-space, targeting more than 1,000 dissidents, according to a leading cyber-security company. The efforts were directed against individuals in Iran and 12 other countries, including the UK and US, Check Point said. It said the two groups involved were using new techniques to install spyware on targets' PCs and mobile devices. And this was then being used to steal call recordings and media files. One of the groups, known as Domestic Kitten or APT-50, is accused of tricking people into downloading malicious software on to mobile phones by a variety of means including: repackaging an existing version of an authentic video game found on the Google Play store mimicking an app for a restaurant in Tehran offering a fake mobile-security app providing a compromised app that publishes articles from a local news agency supplying an infected wallpaper app containing pro-Islamic State imagery masquerading as an Android application store to download further software The American-Israeli company's researchers documented 1,200 victims being targeted by the campaign, living in seven countries. There had been more than 600 successful infections, it said. The second group, known as Infy or Prince Of Persia, is said to spy on the home and work PCs of dissidents in 12 countries, extracting sensitive data after tricking people into opening malicious email attachments. The Iranian government has not commented on the report. Domestic Kitten's operation was first identified in 2018. And Check Point said there was evidence it had run at least 10 campaigns since 2017. Four of these were still active, with the most recent beginning in November 2020. And it was using an Iranian blog site, Telegram channels and text messages to lure people into installing its infected software, which the researchers have dubbed Furball, which could: record calls and other sounds track the device's location collect device identifiers, grab text messages and call logs steal media files, including videos and photos, obtain a list of other installed applications steal files from external storage The 600 successful infections are said to have included dissidents, opposition forces and people belonging to the Kurdish ethnic minority in: Iran the US Great Britain Pakistan Afghanistan Turkey Uzbekistan The other group, Infy, is said to have been operating as far back as 2007. Its most recent activity had targeted PCs, with fake emails with attractive content, usually with an attached document, Check Point said. One example provided was of a document apparently about loans being offered to disabled veterans. One infected document appeared to be from the Iranian-government-sponsored Foundation of Martyrs and Veterans Affairs Once the document was opened, a spying tool was installed and sensitive data stolen, the company said. Two documents recently used are said to have included a photo of an Iranian governor, with alleged contact details. The researchers said Infy's capabilities were ""far superior"" to most other known Iranian campaigns, thanks to its ability to be highly selective about its targets and to have generally have gone undetected. ""It is clear that the Iranian government is investing significant resources into cyber-operations,"" Check Point cyber-research head Yaniv Balmas said. ""The operators of these Iranian cyber-espionage campaigns seem to be completely unaffected by any counter-activities done by others, even though both campaigns had been revealed and even stopped in the past.

"South Africa has recorded more than 1.4 million Covid cases South Africa has put its rollout of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine on hold after a study showed ""disappointing"" results against its new Covid variant. Scientists say the variant accounts for 90% of new Covid cases in South Africa. The trial, involving some 2,000 people, found that the vaccine offered ""minimal protection"" against mild and moderate cases. But experts are hopeful that the vaccine will still be effective at preventing severe cases. South Africa has recorded almost 1.5 million coronavirus cases and more than 46,000 deaths since the pandemic began - a higher toll than any other country on the continent. The country has received one million doses of the Oxford-AstraZeneca jab and was preparing to start vaccinating people. Oxford jab offers less S Africa Covid protection How worrying are the new variants? South Africa coronavirus variant: What's the risk? On Monday, the World Health Organization (WHO) warned against jumping to conclusions about the efficacy of Covid vaccines. Dr Katherine O'Brien, the WHO's director of immunisation, said it was very plausible that the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine would still have a meaningful impact on the South African variant, especially when it came to preventing hospitalisations and death. ""Comparing from one piece of evidence to the next really can't be done without a sort of level playing field,"" she said, referring to the evaluation of different trials in different populations and age groups. Dr O'Brien stressed that the WHO's expert panel held ""a very positive view"" of proceeding with the use of the vaccine, including in areas where variants were circulating, but that more data and information would be needed as the pandemic continued. South Africa's Health Minister Zweli Mkhize said his government would wait for further advice on how best to proceed with the AstraZeneca vaccine in light of the findings. In the meantime, he said, the government would offer vaccines produced by Johnson & Johnson and Pfizer in the coming weeks. The trial was carried out by researchers at the University of the Witwatersrand in South Africa and the UK's Oxford University, but has not yet been peer reviewed. The trial's chief investigator, Prof Shabir Madhi, said it showed that ""unfortunately, the AstraZeneca vaccine does not work against mild and moderate illness"". This video can not be played Prof Barry Schoub on South Africa's decision to stop the AstraZeneca vaccine roll-out. Prof Madhi said the study had not been able to investigate the vaccine's efficacy in preventing more serious infections, as participants had an average age of 31 and so did not represent the demographic most at risk of severe symptoms from the virus. The vaccine's similarity to one produced by Johnson & Johnson, which was found in a recent study to be highly effective at preventing severe disease in South Africa, suggested it would still prevent serious illness, according to Prof Madhi. ""There's still some hope that the AstraZeneca vaccine might well perform as well as the Johnson & Johnson vaccine in a different age group demographic that I address of severe disease,"" he told the BBC. Other experts were also hopeful that the vaccine remained effective at combating more serious cases. ""What we're seeing from other vaccine developers is that they have a reduction in efficacy against some of the variant viruses and what that is looking like is that we may not be reducing the total number of cases, but there's still protection in that case against deaths, hospitalisations and severe disease,"" Prof Sarah Gilbert, Oxford's lead vaccine developer, told the Andrew Marr Show on Sunday. She said developers were likely to have a modified version of the injection against the South Africa variant, also known as 501.V2 or B.1.351, later this year. Ministers in the UK have sought to reassure the public over the effectiveness of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine. Vaccines Minister Nadhim Zahawi saidthe injection appeared to work well against dominant variants in the UK, while Health Minister Edward Argar said there was ""no evidence"" the vaccine was not effective at preventing severe illness. Early results from Modernasuggest its vaccine is still effective against the South Africa variant, while AstraZeneca hassaid its vaccine provides good protection against the UK variant first identified late last year. Early results also suggest the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine protects against the new variants. Viruses mutate - so what is happening is not surprising. The mutations seen in South Africa change the part of the virus that the vaccines target. It means all the vaccines that have been produced so far are likely to be affected in some way. Trials for Novavax and Janssen vaccines that were carried out in South Africa showed less effectiveness against this variant. Both are currently before the UK regulator. Therefore the news about Oxford-AstraZeneca does not come out of the blue. The fact it now only has ""minimal"" effect according to reports is concerning - the other vaccines showed effectiveness in the region of 60% against the South African variant. But we should be careful about rushing to judgement. The study was small so there is only limited confidence in the findings. What is more, there is still hope the vaccine will prevent serious illness and hospitalisation. What this once again illustrates is the pandemic is not going to end with one Big Bang. Vaccines are likely to have to change to keep pace with the virus. Progress will be incremental. But vaccines are still the way out of this. The South Africa variant carries a mutation that appears to make it more contagious or easy to spread. However, there is no evidence that it causes more serious illness for the vast majority of people who become infected. As with the original version, the risk is highest for people who are elderly or have significant underlying health conditions. At least 20 other countries including Austria, Norway and Japan, have found cases of the variant. Many South Africans have reacted with shock and disappointment at news that the 1.5 million doses of the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccines will not be as effective as experts had hoped against the new variant first discovered here in November. While there are now more questions than ready answers, the message from health officials is that all is not lost. They believe the vaccine may still be effective in preventing severe illness and go some way in reducing the number of people who need to be admitted into hospital for treatment. This is important in a country where some 80% of the population cannot afford private health care and rely on state hospitals - which are currently overstretched - for health care. So what's the plan now? South Africa's health minister has said they will take a steer from local scientists on how to repurpose the vaccine to get the most out of it. It has been suggested that the vaccine may be useful if given to the older population and to people with co-morbidities. In terms of managing people's concerns, the government and scientists may need to go the extra mile in reassuring citizens that there is still a plan in place and lives can and will be saved.

"Hamilton equalled Michael Schumacher's record of seven Formula 1 world championship this year Formula 1 world champion Lewis Hamilton has signed a new one-year contract with Mercedes for the 2021 season. The 36-year-old's previous deal lapsed in 2020 but he will now race for Mercedes for a ninth season. Hamilton became the sport's most successful driver ever in 2020, breaking Michael Schumacher's all-time win record and drawing level with the German's seven titles. ""Our team has achieved incredible things together,"" said Hamilton. ""We look forward to building on our success even further, while continuously looking to improve, both on and off the track."" Part of the new deal involves a commitment from Mercedes to continue to work with Hamilton on seeking ""greater diversity and inclusion in motorsport"". They will work on creating a new joint charitable foundation and Hamilton says the manufacturer has been ""extremely supportive"" on the issue. ""I'm proud to say we are taking that effort further this year by launching a foundation dedicated to diversity and inclusion in the sport,"" he added. ""I am inspired by all that we can build together and can't wait to get back on the track in March."" Lewis Hamilton: The exceptional kid who conquered the world Stefano Domenicali interview: New Formula 1 chief urges drivers to lead by example Team boss Toto Wolff said the duration of the contract was a consequence of the lateness of the talks, which was caused by them having to delay negotiations when Hamilton contracted Covid in December, and their mutual desire to ""see how the world develops"". There is the uncertainty caused by the pandemic, as well as by a number of major rule changes in F1, including a budget cap that starts this year at $145m (Â£114m) and new technical rules for 2022 aimed at closing up the field. Wolff said the global situation could have an impact on the team's revenue, while Daimler as a group is having to invest in electrification, adding: ""We are living a financial reality that is very different from a few years ago."" He added: ""We are totally in line - Lewis and me and the wider group in Mercedes - about the situation, so there was never a discrepancy in opinion. ""It was just we felt that we had a good signature on a 2021 contract and we needed to get going and then find some time in 2021 earlier than this time to discuss the future. ""And it's not to discuss only 2022 but also beyond, and that was not something we wanted to carve out via video conferencing between Christmas and the end of January."" Wolff emphasised that the decision to set up a foundation on inclusivity and diversity with Hamilton - an idea that originated from Daimler boss Ola Kallenius - ""shows our long-term commitment to each other"". This video can not be played 'Recognise me now?' Lewis Hamilton's career illustrated Wolff said: ""There was never a moment when we thought he wouldn't sign and there was never a moment when he doubted."" He also rejected reports that Hamilton had asked for a veto on his future team-mate or for a share of team revenue. He said: ""None of that is true,"" and described the claims as ""baseless"". Mercedes did not state the value of Hamilton's new contract but his previous deal was for Â£30m a year, with up to a further Â£10m available as bonuses. Wolff said the fact Hamilton was the best driver, with a huge global following and had achieved enormous success was weighed against the fact that all 2,000 employees contribute to the team's success. ""We have always been quite aligned of what the other side would expect on contractual terms,"" Wolff said. ""Because he has this helicopter perspective on the wider world, it was a very tough year for us personally - from a health standpoint and from an economic standpoint - so he knew that even though he delivered on his side, there is a financial economical reality that it is important to respect."" Wolff said no decision had been made on whether Hamilton would race on beyond 2021. He said he recognised that sportspeople had ""shelf lives"" but added: ""As long as he enjoys racing, I think he is very capable of going longer. ""He develops as a driver, he looks after himself in terms of physical training and mental preparation, so I don't think in terms of ability that ends in 2021, but in the end it's his decision."" The new deal means both Hamilton and team-mate Valtteri Bottas will be out of contract at the end of 2021, as will Williams driver George Russell, a Mercedes protege who starred on replacing Hamilton at the Sakhir Grand Prix in December, when the champion had coronavirus. Wolff said the ""first discussions"" over 2022 would be held with Mercedes' two existing drivers, but added: ""On the other side, the young drivers are the future, and we want to consider how we want to set ourselves up for the years beyond."" This video can not be played Hamilton wins Sports Personality of the Year 2020 Hamilton's defence of his title begins at the Bahrain Grand Prix on 26 March and if he can win a fifth drivers' championship in a row he will surpass the all-time record of seven he shares with Michael Schumacher. He has won six of his world titles at Mercedes, with the other arriving at McLaren in 2008. Mercedes have won the constructors' championship seven times in a row and the drivers' world title has also gone to one of their drivers for seven straight seasons, with Nico Rosberg's 2016 success sandwiched in between Hamilton's six wins. ""The story of Mercedes and Lewis has written itself into the history books of our sport over the past eight seasons, and we are hungry to compete and to add more chapters to it,"" said Wolff.

"The Queen was shown legislation which may have forced her to reveal her private finances in the 1970s ""by convention"", Buckingham Palace says. Paperspublished by the Guardian,externalsuggest the monarch's personal lawyers successfully lobbied to change a draft law to conceal her wealth. The documents were unearthed as part of an investigation into Queen's consent. It is a process where Parliament asks for consent when debating bills which affect the Crown's interests. More than 1,000 draft laws have been seen by the Queen or the Prince of Wales before being approved by MPs as part of the procedure,the Guardian said,external. Queen's consent is always granted where requested, the palace said. The long-established convention sees the monarch asked to provide consent by Parliament when it is considering legislation ""which would affect the prerogative or interests of the Crown"", according to the Royal Family's website. This process is separate to Royal Assent, where the monarch formally approves to a bill passed by Parliament for it to become law. Royal Assent has not been refused since 1708. Royal accounts show potential Â£35m Covid shortfall Queen and Prince Philip get Covid vaccine New Â£5 coin to mark Queen's 95th birthday The government memos, found in the National Archives, date back to 1973. They show that the Queen, concerned that new legislation might force her to reveal her private holdings in companies, despatched lawyers to argue her case with the then Department of Trade and Industry. A revision to the draft law subsequently enabled her as a head of state to sidestep the new regulations. The Guardian suggests that early sight of the draft legislation, under the powers of Queen's consent, gave the monarch an unrivalled opportunity to influence the legislation to her advantage. This is a good get by the Guardian - shining a light into the always-sensitive interactions between palace and government as regards money. The palace line on this is pretty simple - the mechanism of Queen's consent is a matter for government and discussions between the sovereign through her lawyers and government departments are a fact of life. Getting first sight of legislation that may affect you is a pretty significant advantage for any monarch. Not because anyone thinks about a block or veto or a threat of it.  But because then you get a chance to get your lawyers round early. Why is the palace denying a threat of a block, something that no one has alleged? Because, says a source, the allegations put to it by the Guardian were broader than those that turned up in the story published yesterday. It's not entirely surprising that given the consultation in these areas, the Queen would have something to say. The Queen is not a normal citizen. The tone of the correspondence published by the Guardian is a little surprising - it suggests a degree of involvement that belies the palace's claim that the mechanism is simply a formality. The Guardian has compiled a list of 1,062 parliamentary bills that it says have been subject to Queen's consent since Elizabeth II's reign began in 1952 - which works out at about 14 uses of the procedure per year. It features a wide range of legislation including laws which affected her private estates in Balmoral and Sandringham. A Buckingham Palace spokesman said: ""Queen's consent is a parliamentary process, with the role of sovereign purely formal. Consent is always granted by the monarch where requested by government. Any assertion that the sovereign has blocked legislation is simply incorrect. ""Whether Queen's consent is required is decided by Parliament, independently from the royal household, in matters that would affect Crown interests, including personal property and personal interests of the monarch. ""If consent is required, draft legislation is, by convention, put to the sovereign to grant solely on advice of ministers and as a matter of public record.""

"There have been almost 200,000 Covid-19 cases in Wales since the start of the pandemic The number of deaths from coronavirus reported to Public Health Wales (PHW) has gone past 5,000. A further 12 people have died in Wales with Covid, taking the total to 5,001. Health Minister Vaughan Gething has apologised for ""every single life that has been lost"" during the pandemic. ""Today we reached a sobering milestone,"" said Dr Giri Shankar, Covid incident director for PHW. ""That's one life lost every 90 minutes since March last year. 5,000 families grieving."" It comes on the same day as it is confirmed thatmore than 600,000 people in Wales- 19.2% of the Welsh population - have had their first dose of the coronavirus vaccine. Your tributes to those lost to Covid in Wales Booster jab 'may be needed to tackle variants' Widow's plea to BAME communities to have vaccine The PHW reports deaths that are confirmed cases in hospitals and some care homes. The number who have died with Covid when the virus is either suspected or confirmed by doctors, in all settings, is nearly 6,500. ""I'm deeply sorry for every single life that's been lost. Every family that's been affected,"" said Mr Gething. He said those that died were not ""just numbers"", adding: ""These are people who are loved and valued and leave others behind."" He said there was no ""good"" or ""bad"" figure for the numbers of deaths from the pandemic. He added: ""I'm afraid we can be terribly confident that without the measures that we've all taken together, more people would have come to harm, and more families would be grieving the loss of a loved one."" Dr Shankar urged everyone ""whatever their background, socio-demographic and ethnicity"" to have the vaccine when offered it. Vaughan Gething says it's difficult to talk about ""good"" and ""bad"" death figures in this pandemic. Many people might question the latter point. It's true that counting Covid deaths is not straightforward. Different organisations use different measures and therefore produce different figures. But of today's tragic milestone, more than two-thirds of the 5,001 deaths have occurred since September. International comparisons are difficult too, but nevertheless Wales - and the rest of the UK - has one of the highest excess death tolls in the world. There will be a large variety of possible explanations for this, from investment in health systems, to the rapidity of test and trace and the timings of lockdowns. But with elections across Britain scheduled for May, a dispassionate excavation of the data and the impact of decision making by governments will likely have to wait for the public inquiry. The worst day for Covid deaths in Wales during the whole pandemic was in January - theworst week was also last month- and the highest 13 days of coronavirus deaths reported by PHW have all occurred since mid-December. Hospital admissions involving coronavirus and Covid patients in critical care were at record levels in January - but now they are at their lowest since 28 December, at 2,261 inpatients. Wales' case rate of 116 cases per 100,000 people is the lowest in the UK and the lowest since 6 October. Mr Gething denied the Welsh Government had been naive about the risks at the start of the pandemic. This video can not be played Wales' health minister says those who have died with Covid are not ""just numbers"" He said there were ""different risks to the UK and to Wales at that point in time"". But he added ministers had ""never said"" that if coronavirus ""arrived at our shores in larger numbers then there wouldn't be harm caused - far from it"". Mr Gething said preparations had changed as more information came to light and that the ""reasonable worst case scenario"" in their plans talked about hundreds of thousands of deaths across the UK and ""nearly 26,000 deaths in Wales"". Q&A: What are Wales' lockdown rules? When, where and how will I get my Covid vaccine? Figuring out the stats on coronavirus in Wales Mr Gething said he had warned ministers at the time that ""individual burial may no longer be possible"" but said ""we haven't reached that scenario in reality"". But he said those plans ""show how much worse this could have been"". Welsh Conservative leader in the Senedd Andrew RT Davies called the 5,000 deaths a ""grim milestone"", adding: ""We must never forget the impact on them and their loved ones."" He said the ""consistency around the messaging"" was something that he regretted and it wasn't ""clear and loud enough right the way through the pandemic"", with some confused by ""unnecessary divergences"" between governments. This video can not be played Watch how the Covid-19 map of Wales has changed as case rates have eased since Christmas Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price said the Welsh Government should have gone into lockdown ""harder and earlier"" in March 2020. However he praised the government and all those involved in the vaccination programme for the ""fantastic"" improvement in the vaccination rate. The health minister acknowledged, in hindsight earlier this month, thatmore lives could have been saved had Wales gone into lockdown earlierat the start of the coronavirus pandemic. Office for National Statistics (ONS) figuresinclude all deaths registered, when the virus is suspected or confirmed- and in all settings from hospitals to people's homes. Public Health Wales figures just show hospital and care home deaths with Covid, when cases have been confirmed by a lab test. Under the ONS figures,Wales passed 5,000 deaths a month ago. It is estimated that for 90% of these deaths in Wales, Covid is the underlying cause not just a contributory factor. This video can not be played The different measures for looking at deaths involving Covid-19 in Wales The ONS death toll - up to 22 January - was 6,473, with updated figures due out on Tuesday. Of the deaths reported to Public Health Wales on Monday, four more were in the Betsi Cadwaladr health board area in north Wales, three were in Hywel Dda in west Wales, two each were in Cwm Taf Morgannwg and Aneurin Bevan in south Wales while one death was in Swansea Bay. There were also 610 new Covid infections reported in the last 24 hour period, taking the total number of cases to 196,670. More than 600,000 people have now received their first dose of the coronavirus vaccine in Wales - with 603,976 people now having had the jab. Of those, 2,792 have had a second dose. Figuring out the stats on coronavirus in Wales How many people have been vaccinated in Wales? How many coronavirus cases in the UK? The case rate in Wales has fallen to 116 per 100,000 people, the lowest it has been for four months. Flintshire has overtaken its neighbouring county Wrexham as the area with the highest case rate with 231.9 per 100,000 people. Wrexham's rate now stands at 229.5. The areas with the lowest case rate are Ceredigion with 56.4 per 100,000 people, followed by Pembrokeshire with 69.9 and Swansea with 70. Since the start of the pandemic 1,559,030  people have been tested for Covid-19 in Wales, with more than 2.5 million tests carried out. On Sunday 11,013 new tests were performed.

"The teenager previously admitted 12 terror offences at the Old Bailey A teenager who is the youngest person in the UK to commit a terror offence has been given a two-year youth rehabilitation order. The 16-year-old boy from Cornwall admitted 12 offences including downloading a bomb-making manual. At the Old Bailey, Judge Mark Dennis QC said a custodial sentence would ""undo"" the progress made since the boy was arrested in July 2019. The teenager, who cannot be named, had ""significant vulnerabilities"", he said. The boy collected far right material and expressed racist, homophobic and anti-Semitic views on online platforms between 2018 and July 2019, the court heard. He became the leader of the British arm of a now banned neo-Nazi terrorist organisation called Feuerkrieg Division. Working from his grandmother's house, he recruited members online such as Paul Dunleavy, a teenager from Rugby,who was jailed last year for preparing a terrorist attack. The group wanted to enact ""white jihad"" and the genocide of non-white people, the court heard. The judge said the boy had entered an ""online world of wicked prejudice and violent bigotry"". He said that a custodial sentence caused ""irreversible harm for the future"" and that public safety required the boy's rehabilitation. The judge said the teenager had ""significant vulnerabilities"" stemming from an ""abnormal childhood"". Paul Dunleavy was jailed for five years and six months, after a trial at Birmingham Crown Court The defendant first joined the neo-Nazi forum Fascist Forge in 2018, having downloaded his first bomb-making manual that year when he was 13. He first came to the attention of police in July 2019 after detectives received information he was constructing a weapon. When the home where he lived with his grandmother was searched, officers found a Nazi flag and a racist slogan painted on the garden shed. The teenager appeared at court on bail by video link from Bodmin Magistrates' Court, sitting next to his grandmother. Jenny Hopkins, from the Crown Prosecution Service, said after the case that people would ""rightly be disturbed that a 13-year-old should hold the most appalling neo-Nazi beliefs"". The boy ""claimed not to have racist views and just wanted to appear cool"", she said, but the ""body of evidence led to him pleading guilty to possession and dissemination of terrorist material"". Det Insp Mark Samuel, of Counter Terrorism Policing South West, said the case was a ""timely reminder of potential extremism"" online. He said the ""risk for the young and vulnerable"" was ""especially true during lockdown where young people spend more time online, often alone and unsupervised"". Ch Supt Jim Pearce from Devon and Cornwall Police said the age of the offender, the ""extreme hatred displayed"" and the speed with which he became leader of the extreme group, ""brings into sharp focus the real and clear danger of online radicalisation"".

Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent News the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccinehas only a limited effect against the South African variant of coronavirus has caused understandable concern. It is the vaccine many people in the UK are being given and scientists have warned the variant ispresent in the country. Viruses mutate - so what is happening is not surprising. As more people build up immunity - either through vaccination or exposure to the virus - there is going to be more pressure on the virus to change in ways that allow it to escape human defences. An important thing to remember is the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine remains highly effective against the type of virus dominant in the UK. The same is also true for the Pfizer-BioNTech jab, which is also being used in the UK. Read more from Nickhere. The coronavirus variant that was first identified in the south-east of the UK is now spreading through the US, according to a new study. The strain - which is more contagious - is nearly doubling its prevalence among confirmed cases in the US every nine days. Case numbers of the new variant are still somewhat small in the US - but the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has predicted it could be the predominant strain by March. The report has not yet been peer-reviewed or published in a journal. Read the full story here.

The mother-of-two and grandmother to twin three-year-old girls tested positive for coronavirus while in hospital and died, where she worked, at Ysbyty Ystrad Fawr, on 27 October 2020, at the age of 62.

Mexican President AndrÃ©s Manuel LÃ³pez Obrador has held his first public briefing since testing positive for the virus last month, saying he has now recovered from Covid-19. The left-wing leader, a 64-year-old with a history of heart problems, announced on 24 January that he was undergoing treatment for the coronavirus. But last week LÃ³pez Obrador said he had tested negative for Covid-19 after two weeks in isolation. âI thank all Mexicans, men and women, who worried about my illness because of my Covid infection. Fortunately I got through it,â he told reporters at the National Palace. âWe are back on our feet and fighting.â Government updates on LÃ³pez Obradorâs condition said he had experienced mild symptoms, including a low-grade fever and a slight headache. LÃ³pez Obrador is among several world leaders to have received treatment for coronavirus infections. UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson and former US President Donald Trump were both admitted to hospital with the disease last year. Introducing mandatory quarantines at the border is the best way to guard against new coronavirus variants, Labour's shadow health minister says. Speaking to BBC News after today's Downing Street briefing, Alex Norris says he was ""cheered"" to hear the latest vaccine take-up figures. But says he was surprised that quarantines were not discussed at the briefing. He says the government needs to ""quicken up"" the introduction of the measure. ""The best way to guard against new [variants] is by having quarantines,"" he says.

Jonathan Brown spent four hours in his garden near Stowmarket in Suffolk  sculpting a Covid-19 vaccination scene out of snow to encourage people to have the jab. He hoped that sharing it on social media it would help people ""tolerate"" the lockdown restrictions and stay optimistic. ""We just need to be patient and I was hoping to highlight the light at the end of the tunnel,"" he said. Snowfall has been so heavy, a number ofvaccination centres in the county closedon Sunday and Monday. Health secretary Matt Hancock has just been giving a Downing Street coronavirus briefing. It was mostly about vaccines and variants, hereâs what we
learnt: Â· Alex Rogers from MyLondon and Yorkshire Live is the final journalist on today's briefing, and asks if Early Years childcare workers will soon be eligible to get free and regular Covid tests. Hancock says yes, such tests will be available as part ofplans allowing businesses with more than 50 employees to access lateral flow tests, which can produce results in less than 30 minutes. Previously only firms with more than 250 staff qualified for testing. ""We'll set out details in due course,"" Hancock adds. That brings an end to the news conference. The next question comes from the Guardian about international travel. Should people be prepared for tougher restrictions on travel until there is widespread vaccination? Matt Hancock says: ""The proportion of cases coming from abroad at the moment is obviously very low, not least because it's currently illegal to go on holiday anyway. ""Of course we want to lift these measures... as soon is safely possible. ""But until we know, we need to know more about the impact of the vaccines on all these different variants and therefore for now, the precautionary principle is the right approach."" Prof Van-Tam is asked whether it is too early to book summer holidays in the UK. ""Thanks for the question and I can't answer it. I think it's just too early to say,"" he replies. ""We don't yet have the read-outs on the success of the vaccine programme although I expect we'll start to see these in one to two weeks."" ""The more elaborate your plans are for the summer holidays in terms of crossing borders, in terms of household mixing, given where we are now, I think we just have to say, the more you're stepping into making guesses about the unknown at this point. ""I can't give people a proper answer at this point. We don't yet have the data, it's just too early."" Â© 2025 BBC.

"The Queen was shown legislation which may have forced her to reveal her private finances in the 1970s ""by convention"", Buckingham Palace says. Paperspublished by the Guardian,externalsuggest the monarch's personal lawyers successfully lobbied to change a draft law to conceal her wealth. The documents were unearthed as part of an investigation into Queen's consent. It is a process where Parliament asks for consent when debating bills which affect the Crown's interests. More than 1,000 draft laws have been seen by the Queen or the Prince of Wales before being approved by MPs as part of the procedure,the Guardian said,external. Queen's consent is always granted where requested, the palace said. The long-established convention sees the monarch asked to provide consent by Parliament when it is considering legislation ""which would affect the prerogative or interests of the Crown"", according to the Royal Family's website. This process is separate to Royal Assent, where the monarch formally approves to a bill passed by Parliament for it to become law. Royal Assent has not been refused since 1708. Royal accounts show potential Â£35m Covid shortfall Queen and Prince Philip get Covid vaccine New Â£5 coin to mark Queen's 95th birthday The government memos, found in the National Archives, date back to 1973. They show that the Queen, concerned that new legislation might force her to reveal her private holdings in companies, despatched lawyers to argue her case with the then Department of Trade and Industry. A revision to the draft law subsequently enabled her as a head of state to sidestep the new regulations. The Guardian suggests that early sight of the draft legislation, under the powers of Queen's consent, gave the monarch an unrivalled opportunity to influence the legislation to her advantage. This is a good get by the Guardian - shining a light into the always-sensitive interactions between palace and government as regards money. The palace line on this is pretty simple - the mechanism of Queen's consent is a matter for government and discussions between the sovereign through her lawyers and government departments are a fact of life. Getting first sight of legislation that may affect you is a pretty significant advantage for any monarch. Not because anyone thinks about a block or veto or a threat of it.  But because then you get a chance to get your lawyers round early. Why is the palace denying a threat of a block, something that no one has alleged? Because, says a source, the allegations put to it by the Guardian were broader than those that turned up in the story published yesterday. It's not entirely surprising that given the consultation in these areas, the Queen would have something to say. The Queen is not a normal citizen. The tone of the correspondence published by the Guardian is a little surprising - it suggests a degree of involvement that belies the palace's claim that the mechanism is simply a formality. The Guardian has compiled a list of 1,062 parliamentary bills that it says have been subject to Queen's consent since Elizabeth II's reign began in 1952 - which works out at about 14 uses of the procedure per year. It features a wide range of legislation including laws which affected her private estates in Balmoral and Sandringham. A Buckingham Palace spokesman said: ""Queen's consent is a parliamentary process, with the role of sovereign purely formal. Consent is always granted by the monarch where requested by government. Any assertion that the sovereign has blocked legislation is simply incorrect. ""Whether Queen's consent is required is decided by Parliament, independently from the royal household, in matters that would affect Crown interests, including personal property and personal interests of the monarch. ""If consent is required, draft legislation is, by convention, put to the sovereign to grant solely on advice of ministers and as a matter of public record.""

"This video can not be played A number of Gardai (Irish police) checkpoints were operating along the border on Monday People driving from NI into the Republic of Ireland are being turned back at the border if they do not have an essential reason for travel. NI residents face fines from Monday if they are caught crossing the border without ""a reasonable excuse"". The unprecedented step has been taken by the Irish government in a bid to prevent the spread of Covid-19. Anyone engaged in cross-border travel in breach of Ireland's Covid-19 restrictions will be fined â¬100 (Â£88). A number of Garda (Irish police) checkpoints were operational along the border from 07:00 local time. At a checkpoint near Emyvale in County Monaghan, Insp Adrian Durcan said some people had ""turned back"" when requested. ""We have engaged with a few people who have not had essential reasons and on the advice of the guards, they have turned back,"" he said. ""I think it was three so far this morning."" A checkpoint was set up near Emyvale on the Tyrone-Monaghan border Insp Durcan said fines would be issued to those not complying with the regulations. ""They will receive the fine and have 28 days to pay the fine, failure to pay that fine will result in a court appearance,"" he said. ""If they don't pay it we will issue a summons in respect of the offence and we will follow through on that summons."" Confusion in border village over new Covid rules Northern Ireland residents who have to cross the border for essential work or essential purposes, such as seeking medical treatment, will be exempt from fines. Public health guidance in NI says people ""should not travel in or out of Northern Ireland except where it is essential to do so"". Irish police have new enforcement powers which include the right to fine people engaged in non-essential travel The new rules are the latest in a series of decisions aimed at reducing travel to and within the Republic of Ireland, but it is the first time that people from Northern Ireland will face financial penalties for non-essential cross-border travel. The Republic of Ireland is currently in the highest level of lockdown, known as ""level five"" in the government's five-stage plan for managing Covid-19. Level five measures include a strict travel ban which means residents in the Republic of Ireland are temporarily prohibited from going more than 5km (3 miles) away from their home. There areexceptions to the 5km limit,externalfor people who have to travel further for essential work; medical reasons; caring responsibilities; and other essential purposes such as shopping for necessities like food. Since January 2021, gardaÃ­ have new enforcement powers which include the right to fine people engaged in non-essential travel. Another checkpoint on Monday - this time near Drogheda Until now, Ireland's travel restrictions did not apply to people living in Northern Ireland, although Garda checkpoints a short distance from the border during earlier lockdowns did cause sometailbacks for cross-border traffic. The new cross-border fines follow recent amendments to the Irish government's Covid-19 health legislation. The regulations now state that ""any other person who is not ordinarily resident in the state shall not travel within a relevant geographical location without reasonable excuse"". GardaÃ­ said if they stop a car with a driver and two adults who should not be crossing the border, all three will receive a â¬100 fine.  Cyclists and pedestrians will also be liable for fines. ""Travelling to an airport or port to take a holiday abroad is not an essential journey,"" they also warned. Any adult who is detected travelling to an Irish airport or port for a non-essential trip or holiday abroad currently faces a â¬500 fine. A Garda spokeswoman confirmed holidaymakers from Northern Ireland who are stopped by gardaÃ on their way to an airport will be liable for both that â¬500 fine and the â¬100 cross-border fine.

"This video can not be played Super Bowl 55 highlights: Tom Brady wins record seventh title Tom Brady steered the Tampa Bay Buccaneers to a comfortable 31-9 victory over the Kansas City Chiefs to extend his record for Super Bowl wins to seven. In his first season after a glittering 20-year spell with the New England Patriots, the evergreen quarterback helped Tampa Bay become the first team to play a Super Bowl in their own stadium. And despite facing Kansas City and their dynamic young quarterback Patrick Mahomes, who came in as favourites, Brady threw three touchdown passes to prevent the Chiefs becoming the first back-to-back NFL champions since Brady and the Patriots in the 2004 season. At 43 years and 188 days, Brady became the oldest player to play in the biggest game in US sport, extending his record for Super Bowl appearances to 10 and joining Peyton Manning as the only quarterbacks to win Super Bowls with two different teams. Already widely considered the greatest NFL player of all time, Brady decided to leave New England in the off-season for a new challenge andwas lured to Tampa Bay,whose only previous Super Bowl win came in the 2002 season. Is this the GOAT's greatest achievement? Brady wins seventh Super Bowl - as it happened He reportedly urged the Bucs tobring in former Patriots team-mates Rob Gronkowskiand Antonio Brown, as well as Leonard Fournette, and the trio shared Tampa Bay's four touchdowns as they eased home in Super Bowl 55 after leading 21-6 at half-time. While the Chiefs came into the post-season as the top seed in the AFC Conference, Tampa Bay were the NFC's fifth seed and became the first wildcard team to win a Super Bowl since the Green Bay Packers 10 years ago after a remarkable play-off run. After losing to the Chiefs in week 12, the Bucs finished the regular season with four wins before beating three division winners - all on the road - to reach the title decider for just the second time. Remarkably, Brady now has more Super Bowl wins than any single NFL franchise and was named the big game's Most Valuable Player for a record-extending fifth time. ""I'm so proud of all of these guys,"" he said. ""We had a rough November but Bruce Arians (head coach) had all of the confidence in us and we came together at the right time. ""I'm not making any comparisons. Coming down here and playing with this group of guys is amazing."" Gronkowski and Brady celebrate in front of a crowd of 25,000 at the Raymond James Stadium, which included 7,500 vaccinated healthcare workers While at New England, Brady formed the NFL's most successful quarterback-coach partnership with Bill Belichick, and when he left, some felt that Belichick deserved more of the credit, that Brady would get 'found out' without him. But the Patriots endured their first losing season since 2000 - the year before Brady became their starting QB - while Brady has won another Super Bowl, with a team he joined during a pandemic, after a heavily disrupted off-season with no pre-season games. It was also a team that, before this season, had not won a play-off game since winning Super Bowl 37. They had not reached the post-season at all since 2007. But Brady recognised they were gradually building a competitive roster. They had a solid offensive line that would protect him in the pocket and two of the NFL's best receivers in Mike Evans and Chris Godwin. During Super Bowl week, coach Bruce Arians said Brady was ""the missing piece"". For good measure, they brought Gronkowski out of retirement,gave Brown another chanceand picked up free agent Fournette. All came to the fore as the Bucs ramped up for an unlikely run at the Super Bowl and after Kansas City opened the scoring with a field goal, Brady found Brown twice on the next drive before sending tight end Gronkowski over with a screen pass. The pair combined to devastating effect at New England before Gronkowski retired after winning Super Bowl 53 with Brady and the Patriots. The 31-year-old had brief stints in WWE and television during his time out. But after easing back into the rigours of the NFL with seven touchdowns during the regular season, he caught a 17-yard strike by Brady for his second of Super Bowl 55. The Chiefs finally got some offence going to reply with a field goal, 61 seconds from half-time, and just as they did in theNFC Championship game against the Packers,Tampa Bay claimed a crucial score right before the half as Brady completed a 71-yard drive by finding Brown in the end zone. Kansas City rallied at the start of the second half and cut the deficit with another field goal, but the Bucs continued to dominate on both sides of the ball, stifling the NFL's best offence. Brady found Gronkowski for another big play before Fournette burst through for a 27-yard touchdown to seal a victory which many dreamed of in Tampa when Brady came aboard, but few would have thought was possible. Osi Umenyiora, two-time Super Bowl champion and former New York Giants defensive end: ""Tom Brady should be the first player in history to be in the Hall of Fame while he's still playing. What this man has done this year is almost beyond belief, almost beyond words. I cannot describe the level of difficulty, what it took for this man to do what he's done. ""Every single year this guy's been doubted, every single year this man rises to the top like a phoenix. This guy is the greatest professional athlete we have seen in history, and this goes for any sport. And I'm not just saying that to be hyperbolic. What this guy is doing in the quarterback position - the hardest position to play in sports - winning over and over again... my hat's off to this guy."" Jason Bell, former Houston Texans cornerback: ""It's all because of Brady's focus, his attention to detail. He came into the league as an underdog and he's never let it go. It drives him every single day."" On the manner of Kansas City's defeat:""This defeat is humbling for the Chiefs, no doubt. They're going to want to get the taste of this out of their mouth. This was a terrible performance and I didn't like the way they reacted to adversity, the way they were talking to each other when they got down wasn't right. They'll have to bounce back next season."" Patrick Mahomes threw for 270 yards but finished with two interceptions and was sacked three times After leading Kansas City to theirfirst Super Bowl win in 50 years,Mahomes was rewarded with a 10-year contract last July, making him the""first half-billion dollar player in sports history"". He had become the youngest player to win the Super Bowl and the NFL MVP award, and the 25-year-old is the most exciting talent of a new era of athletic quarterbacks. After steering the Chiefs back to the big game,'the Kid' now had a chance to take on 'the GOAT'in the NFL showpiece. It was the first to feature the quarterbacks who had won the previous two Super Bowls, and two starting QBs who have both won an NFL MVP and Super Bowl MVP. But Kansas City erred in all three phases of the game - slicing punts on special teams, dropping catches on offence and showing indiscipline on defence. In the first half alone, they were penalised eight times for 95 yards. After Gronkowski put the Bucs in front, the Chiefs pulled off what seemed a huge goal-line stop to prevent the hosts extending their lead. Then Tyrann Mathieu claimed an interception on Tampa Bay's next drive, only to see it cancelled out by a defensive holding call. And although they forced the Bucs to settle for a field goal, an offside put the ball back in Brady's hands to pick out Gronkowski for his second touchdown. Despite cutting the score to 14-6 just before the half, two pass interference calls allowed Tampa Bay to march right back downfield and make it a 14-point game with Brown's touchdown before Fournette's third-quarter score proved the decisive blow. ""They were the better team today, they beat us pretty good,"" said Mahomes. ""We didn't end the season the way we wanted, but we'll learn from what went right and what went wrong."" Tom Brady now has more Super Bowl wins than any NFL franchise, one clear of both the New England Patriots and Pittsburgh Steelers (6) Rob Gronkowski became the first man to make at least one catch in five Super Bowls. Brady and Gronkowski have connected for five passing touchdowns in Super Bowls, passing Joe Montana and Jerry Rice (four) for the most in Super Bowl history. Brady and Gronkowski have combined for more post-season touchdowns than any other quarterback-receiver duo all-time - 14. At 68 years and 127 days, Bruce Arians became the oldest coach to win the Super Bowl. This game saw the largest age gap between quarterbacks in Super Bowl history (18 years and 45 days). The star performed a medley of eight hits including Starboy and Blinding Lights Mark Savage, BBC music reporter The Super Bowl Half-time Show is traditionally built on grand gestures and eye-popping spectacle. Think about Lady Gaga diving off the roof of Houston's NRG stadium, or Katy Perry riding an animatronic lion, or Diana Ross soaring out of Arizona's Sun Devil Stadium, waving to fans through the open door of a helicopter. This year was a little different. Canadian R&B star The Weeknd was the interval act and, for the first time in the game's 55-year history, he was largely forced to perform from the stands, rather than the pitch, in compliance with strict coronavirus protocols. And his 12-minute show was ""watched"" by thousands of cardboard cut-outs, who bulked out the 25,000 socially-distanced fans. But the 30-year-old made the most of the restrictions with a gimmick-free show that put the emphasis on his songs. Read more of Mark's review Allow Instagram content?

Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent News the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccinehas only a limited effect against the South African variant of coronavirus has caused understandable concern. It is the vaccine many people in the UK are being given and scientists have warned the variant ispresent in the country. Viruses mutate - so what is happening is not surprising. As more people build up immunity - either through vaccination or exposure to the virus - there is going to be more pressure on the virus to change in ways that allow it to escape human defences. An important thing to remember is the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine remains highly effective against the type of virus dominant in the UK. The same is also true for the Pfizer-BioNTech jab, which is also being used in the UK. Read more from Nickhere. The coronavirus variant that was first identified in the south-east of the UK is now spreading through the US, according to a new study. The strain - which is more contagious - is nearly doubling its prevalence among confirmed cases in the US every nine days. Case numbers of the new variant are still somewhat small in the US - but the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has predicted it could be the predominant strain by March. The report has not yet been peer-reviewed or published in a journal. Read the full story here.

A court document obtained by the BBC shows NHS infection control experts were concerned the gowns were only single wrapped.

Ron Wright is the first sitting member of Congress to die with Covid-19 US Republican congressman Ron Wright has died aged 67 after testing positive for Covid-19 - the first sitting member of Congress to die with the disease. The Texas lawmaker ""passed away peacefully"" with his wife Susan by his side on Sunday, his office said in a statement. The couple had both been infected with the virus and were receiving treatment at Baylor Hospital in Dallas. Mr Wright, who was elected to the House of Representatives in 2018 and had also been battling cancer in recent years, announced he had contracted the virus on 21 January. Announcing his death on Monday, his office said: ""Despite years of painful, sometimes debilitating treatment for cancer, Ron never lacked the desire to get up and go to work, to motivate those around him, or to offer fatherly advice."" The US is by far the world's worst-hit nation when it comes to the pandemic, with more than 463,000 coronavirus-related deaths and over 27 million cases reported.

Cheryl Saunders, from Abercarn in Caerphilly county, spent her whole 40-year career working in the NHS as a medical secretary in respiratory medicine, first in Caerphilly Miners' Hospital and later at Ysbyty Ystrad Fawr in nearby Ystrad Mynach. She still worked in respiratory medicine at the start of the pandemic but was forced to stop working in the summer after being diagnosed with advanced metastatic renal - or kidney - cancer. The mother-of-two and grandmother to twin three-year-old girls tested positive for coronavirus while in hospital and died, where she worked, at Ysbyty Ystrad Fawr, on 27 October 2020, at the age of 62.

Mexican President AndrÃ©s Manuel LÃ³pez Obrador has held his first public briefing since testing positive for the virus last month, saying he has now recovered from Covid-19. The left-wing leader, a 64-year-old with a history of heart problems, announced on 24 January that he was undergoing treatment for the coronavirus. But last week LÃ³pez Obrador said he had tested negative for Covid-19 after two weeks in isolation. âI thank all Mexicans, men and women, who worried about my illness because of my Covid infection. Fortunately I got through it,â he told reporters at the National Palace. âWe are back on our feet and fighting.â Government updates on LÃ³pez Obradorâs condition said he had experienced mild symptoms, including a low-grade fever and a slight headache. LÃ³pez Obrador is among several world leaders to have received treatment for coronavirus infections. UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson and former US President Donald Trump were both admitted to hospital with the disease last year. Introducing mandatory quarantines at the border is the best way to guard against new coronavirus variants, Labour's shadow health minister says. Speaking to BBC News after today's Downing Street briefing, Alex Norris says he was ""cheered"" to hear the latest vaccine take-up figures. But says he was surprised that quarantines were not discussed at the briefing. He says the government needs to ""quicken up"" the introduction of the measure.

Matt Hancock says: ""The proportion of cases coming from abroad at the moment is obviously very low, not least because it's currently illegal to go on holiday anyway.

"Shamim Abbas lost her husband Ghulam last April ""I'd shout it from the street - please have your vaccinations, you don't know what we're going through."" This is a plea from Shamim Abbas of Newport, wholost husband Ghulam and brother-in-law Razato Covid. The brothers died within hours of each other last April. Concerns have been growing in recent weeks about an apparent hesitancy from some people in black, Asian, and minority ethnic (BAME) communities to have the Covid-19 vaccine. And even though the virus has had such a devastating impact on Shamim's family, some relatives have been unsure about having it. Vaccine rumours debunked: 'Altered DNA' How many people have been vaccinated in Wales? When, where and how will I get my Covid vaccine? ""My brother-in-law didn't want to have it done - he didn't want to let my mother-in-law have it done,"" she said. This video can not be played Shamim Abbas  said despite Covid's devastating impact on her family, some relatives had been unsure about having their jabs ""I had to calm him down and reassure him. People are scared. They are reading these reports and they are scared. ""People seeing us now - for me and my daughters it's a living hell everyday. We miss him every minute of the day."" The reports that Shamim is talking aboutare myths or conspiracy theoriesthat are posted online and on social media. ""I think the problem is that whereas resources that combat this misinformation are available in English, they're not necessarily available in languages that some of these communities speak as a first language,"" explains Dr Bnar Talabani, a doctor specialising in kidney and transplant medicine at the University Hospital of Wales, Cardiff. She is part of a group calledMuslim Doctors Cymru,external, who are trying to dispel some of the myths circling on the internet. They are carrying out a survey asking people for their views on the vaccine - and although only 220 people have replied so far, the results paint a picture reflected in other polling on the issue. This video can not be played The brothers who died with coronavirus About 10% of people said they would not be taking the vaccine, with 16% unsure. ""These aren't anti-vaxxers, they are actually very, very open to dialogue,"" Dr Talabani said. ""One elderly gentleman I recently had a conversation with said to me 'well, does the vaccine change my DNA?' and I said 'Well, no, it cannot because it doesn't come into contact with your DNA'. ""And he said 'okay, well that was my only concern. I'm happy to have it now', and it was really that simple."" Hassan Ahmed was happy to have the jab after being reassured by a doctor A similar conversation took place at the Cardiff Bay surgery in Grangetown, where Hassan Ahmed, 77, who moved to the UK from Yemen in 1977, was waiting to be vaccinated. ""I heard people say the injection is bad for us, but you're the doctor, I don't know,"" he said. His GP, Dr Emaad Alauddin, chatted him through how the vaccine worked, reassuring him, and afterwards, Mr Ahmed described his happiness about receiving it. Dr Talabani said a problem within communities is that people receive misinformation in their own language via social media. ""If English is not your first language, you receive lots of misinformation via WhatsApp and other social media platforms in languages that are your first language, but the accurate information that is needed to combat this you don't necessarily have access to in that language,"" she said. Having that information accessible and readily available and actually using social media as a platform to spread it just as the misinformation is also being spread, so arming communities with accurate information in multiple languages will go a long way in helping address this."" She added it was important this information comes from a ""grassroots"" level as well as from the government, and to engage faith leaders. ""We are holding weekly webinars in different languages and people within different communities are actually engaging with us. ""We're having feedback that that dialogue, the possibility to ask questions about the vaccine in a language they're comfortable with, with people who are from their own community, is really helping them address those concerns."" Mr Ahmed will now await the second dose of the vaccine At the end of January, analysis of patient data in England to the middle of the month found black people over the age of 80 werehalf as likely to have been vaccinatedas those who were white. Public Health Wales said its data showing ethnic breakdown of vaccine take-up is not available yet. Chairman of Race Council Cymru Ray Singh believes it needs to be in the public domain now. ""If we had data, we would know how many black Asians have been vaccinated, say in area one and how many people live in that area, and then the communities leaders and others can start working on these with these people to persuade them,"" he said. ""This is a race against time, a question of life and death. ""The minister for vaccination for England admitted that there was disparity in England and I see no reason why we're not having the same, but we have no data."" Naveed Rahman has called for mosques to be used as vaccination centres Another idea to increase confidence in the vaccine is to try and use places like mosques as vaccination centres. The Dar-Ul-Isra mosque in Cardiff is one of those which has told the local health board that it would be happy to be used. ""We feel that as a mosque we are in the best position to dispel the myths - explain to people that there is no issue with taking the vaccine from a theological point of view but also from a health perspective,"" said Naveed Rahman, an administrator for the mosque. ""I think people just coming to the mosque and knowing they are taking the vaccine in the mosque will be a big part of that."" Public Health Wales recognised ""the importance of ensuring equitable access to and uptake"" of vaccinations. It said it was examining data and other information, including ethnicity, to see who in what groups had been vaccinated. ""It will be shared with colleagues working to implement the vaccination programme in local areas to help identify areas in the local community where uptake of the vaccine is not as high as we would like,"" a spokesman said. ""We encourage everyone to have the vaccine when they are offered it, whatever their background."" Health Minister Vaughan Gething quoted Office for National Statistics figures showing men from black African backgrounds and women from black Caribbean backgrounds had the highest death rates for their sex but added Covid was having a disproportionate impact on all black, Asian and minority ethnic communities. He said: ""We need to dispel misinformation and unite as a country to protect those we care about the most, from this deadly virus. ""I want to make it abundantly clear to all, the vaccine contains no pork products or traces of foetal matter and is safe for all ethnic minority and faith communities.

Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent News the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccinehas only a limited effect against the South African variant of coronavirus has caused understandable concern. It is the vaccine many people in the UK are being given and scientists have warned the variant ispresent in the country. Viruses mutate - so what is happening is not surprising. As more people build up immunity - either through vaccination or exposure to the virus - there is going to be more pressure on the virus to change in ways that allow it to escape human defences. An important thing to remember is the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine remains highly effective against the type of virus dominant in the UK. The same is also true for the Pfizer-BioNTech jab, which is also being used in the UK. Read more from Nickhere. The coronavirus variant that was first identified in the south-east of the UK is now spreading through the US, according to a new study. The strain - which is more contagious - is nearly doubling its prevalence among confirmed cases in the US every nine days. Case numbers of the new variant are still somewhat small in the US - but the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has predicted it could be the predominant strain by March. The report has not yet been peer-reviewed or published in a journal. Read the full story here.

"South Africa has recorded more than 1.4 million Covid cases South Africa has put its rollout of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine on hold after a study showed ""disappointing"" results against its new Covid variant. Scientists say the variant accounts for 90% of new Covid cases in South Africa. The trial, involving some 2,000 people, found that the vaccine offered ""minimal protection"" against mild and moderate cases. But experts are hopeful that the vaccine will still be effective at preventing severe cases. South Africa has recorded almost 1.5 million coronavirus cases and more than 46,000 deaths since the pandemic began - a higher toll than any other country on the continent. The country has received one million doses of the Oxford-AstraZeneca jab and was preparing to start vaccinating people. Oxford jab offers less S Africa Covid protection How worrying are the new variants? South Africa coronavirus variant: What's the risk? On Monday, the World Health Organization (WHO) warned against jumping to conclusions about the efficacy of Covid vaccines. Dr Katherine O'Brien, the WHO's director of immunisation, said it was very plausible that the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine would still have a meaningful impact on the South African variant, especially when it came to preventing hospitalisations and death. ""Comparing from one piece of evidence to the next really can't be done without a sort of level playing field,"" she said, referring to the evaluation of different trials in different populations and age groups. Dr O'Brien stressed that the WHO's expert panel held ""a very positive view"" of proceeding with the use of the vaccine, including in areas where variants were circulating, but that more data and information would be needed as the pandemic continued. South Africa's Health Minister Zweli Mkhize said his government would wait for further advice on how best to proceed with the AstraZeneca vaccine in light of the findings. In the meantime, he said, the government would offer vaccines produced by Johnson & Johnson and Pfizer in the coming weeks. The trial was carried out by researchers at the University of the Witwatersrand in South Africa and the UK's Oxford University, but has not yet been peer reviewed. The trial's chief investigator, Prof Shabir Madhi, said it showed that ""unfortunately, the AstraZeneca vaccine does not work against mild and moderate illness"". This video can not be played Prof Barry Schoub on South Africa's decision to stop the AstraZeneca vaccine roll-out. Prof Madhi said the study had not been able to investigate the vaccine's efficacy in preventing more serious infections, as participants had an average age of 31 and so did not represent the demographic most at risk of severe symptoms from the virus. The vaccine's similarity to one produced by Johnson & Johnson, which was found in a recent study to be highly effective at preventing severe disease in South Africa, suggested it would still prevent serious illness, according to Prof Madhi. ""There's still some hope that the AstraZeneca vaccine might well perform as well as the Johnson & Johnson vaccine in a different age group demographic that I address of severe disease,"" he told the BBC. Other experts were also hopeful that the vaccine remained effective at combating more serious cases. ""What we're seeing from other vaccine developers is that they have a reduction in efficacy against some of the variant viruses and what that is looking like is that we may not be reducing the total number of cases, but there's still protection in that case against deaths, hospitalisations and severe disease,"" Prof Sarah Gilbert, Oxford's lead vaccine developer, told the Andrew Marr Show on Sunday. She said developers were likely to have a modified version of the injection against the South Africa variant, also known as 501.V2 or B.1.351, later this year. Ministers in the UK have sought to reassure the public over the effectiveness of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine. Vaccines Minister Nadhim Zahawi saidthe injection appeared to work well against dominant variants in the UK, while Health Minister Edward Argar said there was ""no evidence"" the vaccine was not effective at preventing severe illness. Early results from Modernasuggest its vaccine is still effective against the South Africa variant, while AstraZeneca hassaid its vaccine provides good protection against the UK variant first identified late last year. Early results also suggest the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine protects against the new variants. Viruses mutate - so what is happening is not surprising. The mutations seen in South Africa change the part of the virus that the vaccines target. It means all the vaccines that have been produced so far are likely to be affected in some way. Trials for Novavax and Janssen vaccines that were carried out in South Africa showed less effectiveness against this variant. Both are currently before the UK regulator. Therefore the news about Oxford-AstraZeneca does not come out of the blue. The fact it now only has ""minimal"" effect according to reports is concerning - the other vaccines showed effectiveness in the region of 60% against the South African variant. But we should be careful about rushing to judgement. The study was small so there is only limited confidence in the findings. What is more, there is still hope the vaccine will prevent serious illness and hospitalisation. What this once again illustrates is the pandemic is not going to end with one Big Bang. Vaccines are likely to have to change to keep pace with the virus. Progress will be incremental. But vaccines are still the way out of this. The South Africa variant carries a mutation that appears to make it more contagious or easy to spread. However, there is no evidence that it causes more serious illness for the vast majority of people who become infected. As with the original version, the risk is highest for people who are elderly or have significant underlying health conditions. At least 20 other countries including Austria, Norway and Japan, have found cases of the variant. Many South Africans have reacted with shock and disappointment at news that the 1.5 million doses of the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccines will not be as effective as experts had hoped against the new variant first discovered here in November. While there are now more questions than ready answers, the message from health officials is that all is not lost. They believe the vaccine may still be effective in preventing severe illness and go some way in reducing the number of people who need to be admitted into hospital for treatment. This is important in a country where some 80% of the population cannot afford private health care and rely on state hospitals - which are currently overstretched - for health care. So what's the plan now? South Africa's health minister has said they will take a steer from local scientists on how to repurpose the vaccine to get the most out of it. It has been suggested that the vaccine may be useful if given to the older population and to people with co-morbidities. In terms of managing people's concerns, the government and scientists may need to go the extra mile in reassuring citizens that there is still a plan in place and lives can and will be saved.

"A snow plough on the A66 near Bowes in County Durham where the road was closed due to heavy snow Heavy snow and ice has brought disruption to parts of the UK, withcoronavirus vaccination centres and schools shuttingin some areas. Yellow warnings for snow cover much of England and Scotland, as well as parts of Northern Ireland until Wednesday. Police have warned people not to travel, with long delays expected and road closures in some parts. On Monday, 30cm (12in) of snow fell in Aboyne, Aberdeenshire, while up to 22cm fell in parts of the east of England. Heavy snowfall and temperatures as low as -15C have been forecast for parts of Scotland, withthe Met Office issuing an amber warning for snow,externalfor areas including Perthshire, Stirlingshire and Fife from 03:00 to 21:00 on Tuesday. Further south temperatures could get as low as -10C, BBC Weather's Billy Payne said, in what he described as the most significant cold spell since the Beast from the East three years ago. ""We'll see further snow showers over the next couple of days and widespread overnight frosts and ice with temperatures for some not rising above freezing,"" he said. This video can not be played Snowy scenes across the UK as Storm Darcy causes disruption The Met Office said it was ""bitterly cold"" due to Storm Darcy's strong easterly winds, with temperatures in parts of the UK around freezing. The AA said ""treacherous driving conditions"" had caused ""numerous"" accidents. Some roads were closed in Norfolk, Lincolnshire, Cumbria, Derbyshire and Hertfordshire, with police forces in parts of East Anglia warning drivers some roads had become ""impassable"". In pictures: Storm Darcy brings snow to UK Check the forecast in your area Vaccination centres and schools shut National Rail told train passengers that services across the country were likely to be affected by the conditions and said it may be necessary to close some routes.

"Online fashion retailer Boohoo has bought the Dorothy Perkins, Wallis and Burton brands from failed retail group Arcadia for Â£25.2m The deal includes the brands and online businesses, but not the 214 shops nor 2,450 workers employed in them. It completes the sell-off of Sir Philip Green's once mighty Arcadia group which fell into administration last year. Last week, rival Asos bought Arcadia's other leading brands, Topshop, Topman, Miss Selfridge and HIIT. The Arcadia businesses employed 13,000, a fraction of which will carry on into employment with the new owners. Dorothy Perkins? Why would Boohoo want that? Boohoo tells suppliers to bring work in-house 'I haven't bought clothes in a shop for years' Administrators Deloitte, which has been conducting the sales, said around 2,450 staff would lose their jobs as a result of the Dorothy Perkins, Wallis and Burton sale, and the stores would permanently close. Deloitte said staff had been emailed on Monday and would informed over the course of the day. Approximately 260 jobs will be moving with the brands to Boohoo, mainly head office functions such as brand design, buying and merchandising, and the digital part of the business. Last month, Boohoo bought the Debenhams brand and website for Â£55m. Boohoo said the brands it had bought from Arcadia had two million active customers last year, and added that the deal would give it a significant opportunity to boost its share of the market across a broader group of customers. It also said that buying Burton would improve its range of menswear. ""Acquiring these well-known brands in British fashion out of administration ensures their heritage is sustained, while our investment aims to transform them into brands that are fit for the current market environment,"" said chief executive John Lyttle. ""We have a successful track record of integrating British heritage fashion brands onto our proven multi-brand platform, and we are looking forward to bringing these brands on board."" The debate around the economic recovery from the coronavirus pandemic has shifted subtly in recent weeks from the size and speed of the bounce back to its nature. What parts of pre-pandemic life will return, and which, given the virus is mutating quickly and may turn out to be a long-lasting threat, are gone forever? The debate is already closed in one part of retail, clothing sales. The pandemic has accounted for several big High Street names, and this morning Boohoo bought three more stalwarts - Dorothy Perkins, Burton and Wallis. The names will live on online, but their 214 UK shops will close, with about 2,450 staff losing their jobs. Hundreds more stores that were under the other Arcadia brands - notably Topshop - will also close after the brands were bought by another online player Asos. And Boohoo has already bought the Debenhams name, meaning 125 of its stores will close from next month. This leaves a big hole on British high streets, one that will take a long time to be filled. Councils must now think how they can revitalise their high streets. Should they stick to Plan A and try and lure more retailers to fill the vacant shops, or be more radical, and use this sudden shift in the market as a catalyst for wholesale reinvention? In Stockton-on-Tees a 1970s shopping centre will be bulldozed next year to make way for a park. It may not be the last one to bite the dust. Boohoo has bought a number of other leading High Street names in the past two years, buying the online businesses of Oasis and Warehouse for Â£5.25m last year. That added to its portfolio, which included the Karen Millen and Coast brands, which it bought from administrators in 2019. Susannah Streeter, markets analyst at stockbrokers Hargreaves Lansdown, said the sale of the final assets of the former Arcadia empire gave Boohoo the parts with which to build its own: ""This purchase is part of a grand master plan by Boohoo to become the UK's largest retail marketplace and propel its international expansion. ""As Boohoo expands, the final bricks of Sir Philip Green's retail empire have been dislodged. Boohoo and Asos, dismissed as digital upstarts a decade ago are now the great disruptors in fashion, reaching the top branches of the retail tree.''

"Tesco has called for a 1% sales tax to be levied on online competitors, including Amazon. Boss Ken Murphy has also joined with Morrisons, Asda and Waterstones to ask Chancellor Rishi Sunak for a ""level playing field"" on tax. They say the current system puts retailers with large estates at a disadvantage to online firms. Retailers have not had to pay property-based business rates since the start of the pandemic. However, the tax is due to restart in April. Supermarkets including Tesco and Morrisons have handed back business rates relief worth Â£1.8bn to the government. They had been criticised for taking government support during the pandemic while announcing dividend payments to shareholders. The chief executives of 18 companies and groups have written to the chancellor warning that a return to the old system ""will hamper the recovery of the retail sector post-pandemic, potentially putting thousands of jobs at risk"". Business rates are calculated by looking at a property's rateable value and multiplying it by a tax rate set by the government. A new tax rate comes into effect at the start of each financial year on 1 April. According to figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS), full-year retail sales at physical shops for the 12 months ending 31 December 2020 fell 10.3% from Â£318.5bn in 2019 to Â£285.8bn. The group of 18 bosses stops short of asking for an online sales tax, but Tesco has called for a 1% levy. Last week, Amazon was criticised for paying less in business rates than British bricks-and-mortar retailers. The online retail giant's financial results revealed that UK sales for 2020 totalled $26.5bn (Â£19.3bn) - a 51% jump from $17.5bn in 2019. Amazon's overall business rates bill for 2020-21 is estimated by researchers to be Â£71.5m - just 0.37% of its retail sales. Amazon insists that it pays its tax and has created thousands of jobs in the UK. Retail adviser Altus Group says that bricks-and-mortar retailers would have paid Â£8.25bn in business rates in 2020, had they not been given a tax holiday due to the pandemic. It says the figure was calculated using rateable values, multiplied by the 2020 tax rate. The Â£8.25bn figure amounts to 2.9% of total retail sales, which is much higher than what Amazon pays. For instance, Arcadia - which owned Topshop, Burton and Dorothy Perkins at the time - would have had to pay Â£91m in business rates on its 444 stores in 2020, had there not been a tax holiday, Altus Group says. Robert Hayton, UK president of property tax at Altus Group, told the BBC that changing the business rate system would be ""a good place to start"" in trying to correct the imbalance between online and bricks-and-mortar retailers. However, he added that business rates had often been reviewed in the past 20 years and nothing had changed, because the need to keep the changes fiscally neutral meant that one sector could benefit only at the expense of another. ""If some additional money can be created through something like an online sales tax, and then crucially, if that can be ring-fenced and made available to make some improvements to business rates, then I think that's a really positive outlook,"" he said. Amazon would not comment on the calculations made by Altus Group and the Centre for Retail Research (CRR) A spokesman for Amazon said: ""We've invested more than Â£23bn in jobs and infrastructure in the UK since 2010. ""Last year, we created 10,000 new jobs and last week we announced 1,000 new apprenticeships. This continued investment helped contribute to a total tax contribution of Â£1.1bn during 2019 - Â£293m in direct taxes and Â£854m in indirect taxes."" A Treasury spokesperson said: ""We want to see thriving High Streets, which is why we've spent tens of billions of pounds supporting shops throughout the pandemic and are supporting town centres through the changes online shopping brings. ""Our business rates review call for evidence included questions on whether we should shift the balance between online and physical shops by introducing an online sales tax. We're considering responses now and will update in due course. ""The 2020 Spending Review also confirmed that the business rates multiplier would be frozen in 2021-22, saving businesses in England Â£575m over the next five years."" James Daunt, managing director of bookselling chain Waterstones, told the BBC that shops had ""clearly suffered hugely"" during the pandemic. ""A tax on online sales would at least allow us to keep our shops open,"" he said. He also called for business rates to be reformed or even scrapped in the interest of preserving jobs in local shops. However, Sir Edward Troup, a former senior civil servant at the Treasury, said there were ""30 billion reasons"" why the Treasury would not want to abolish business rates. ""That's the amount of money roughly that business rates raise,"" he said. Sir Edward said Treasury economists recognised that business rates were ""inefficient"", but added: ""It's an old adage that you tax property because it doesn't move."" He said sales taxes were also inefficient because they pushed prices up for customers while being unrelated to the level of profit made by firms.

"Online fashion firm Boohoo has told its Leicester-based suppliers that they must bring all clothes-making work in-house, either buying out or cutting ties with sub-contractors. The demand has caused concern among some suppliers about how they will pay to hire new workers and rent space. Boohoo has given them a deadline of 5 March to stop using outside labour. The company says it is acting on recommendations of a highly critical report published last year. Boohoo hired barrister Alison Levitt QC to investigate following concerns about worker welfare during the pandemic. The report,external, published in September, said Boohoo had ""capitalised on the commercial opportunities offered by lockdown"" but took no responsibility for the consequences for those making the clothes they sold. It recommended that ""within six months Boohoo should reduce its approved suppliers to a list which contains a manageable number of companies, ideally without reducing capacity"" with ""the goal of reducing and ultimately eliminating sub-contracting."" In an email to suppliers seen by the BBC, the company said all of its suppliers in the city must ""bring all finished goods manufacturing in-house"". It said companies without ""the expertise and knowledge to run a factory"" or the space must buy a manufacturing unit, or Cut, Make and Trim (CMT), as they are known. While it said those with questions about the process should contact the company, it added that the move is ""a mandatory requirement and not open to negotiation."" A supplier who spoke to the BBC on condition of anonymity said he was worried about jobs being lost, since the deadline is a month away and many sub-contractors are based miles away. Garment-makers in the city often farm out large orders of clothing to smaller businesses. The business is known to work on very thin margins, with each piece being made for only a few pounds. In the past factories in Leicesterhave been accused of paying lessthan the minimum wage to workers. ""As we state in our letter to suppliers, the boohoo group is committed to growing our business in a more sustainable and transparent manner. Working with suppliers in a more strategic and sustainable way, is a key part of our partnership approach to improve transparency, efficiency and accountability,"" the company said in a statement to the BBC. ""One of the key recommendations from the Alison Levitt QC review was to consolidate our supply chain. Supporting suppliers to bring their CMT units in-house shortens our supply chain and is just one of the ways that we are helping them to build stronger more sustainable businesses that can thrive."" The company declined to comment on what help would be offered by Boohoo for suppliers to manage this change if they are struggling financially.

"This video can not be played Super Bowl 55 highlights: Tom Brady wins record seventh title Tom Brady steered the Tampa Bay Buccaneers to a comfortable 31-9 victory over the Kansas City Chiefs to extend his record for Super Bowl wins to seven. In his first season after a glittering 20-year spell with the New England Patriots, the evergreen quarterback helped Tampa Bay become the first team to play a Super Bowl in their own stadium. And despite facing Kansas City and their dynamic young quarterback Patrick Mahomes, who came in as favourites, Brady threw three touchdown passes to prevent the Chiefs becoming the first back-to-back NFL champions since Brady and the Patriots in the 2004 season. At 43 years and 188 days, Brady became the oldest player to play in the biggest game in US sport, extending his record for Super Bowl appearances to 10 and joining Peyton Manning as the only quarterbacks to win Super Bowls with two different teams. Already widely considered the greatest NFL player of all time, Brady decided to leave New England in the off-season for a new challenge andwas lured to Tampa Bay,whose only previous Super Bowl win came in the 2002 season. Is this the GOAT's greatest achievement? Brady wins seventh Super Bowl - as it happened He reportedly urged the Bucs tobring in former Patriots team-mates Rob Gronkowskiand Antonio Brown, as well as Leonard Fournette, and the trio shared Tampa Bay's four touchdowns as they eased home in Super Bowl 55 after leading 21-6 at half-time. While the Chiefs came into the post-season as the top seed in the AFC Conference, Tampa Bay were the NFC's fifth seed and became the first wildcard team to win a Super Bowl since the Green Bay Packers 10 years ago after a remarkable play-off run. After losing to the Chiefs in week 12, the Bucs finished the regular season with four wins before beating three division winners - all on the road - to reach the title decider for just the second time. Remarkably, Brady now has more Super Bowl wins than any single NFL franchise and was named the big game's Most Valuable Player for a record-extending fifth time. ""I'm so proud of all of these guys,"" he said. ""We had a rough November but Bruce Arians (head coach) had all of the confidence in us and we came together at the right time. ""I'm not making any comparisons. Coming down here and playing with this group of guys is amazing."" Gronkowski and Brady celebrate in front of a crowd of 25,000 at the Raymond James Stadium, which included 7,500 vaccinated healthcare workers While at New England, Brady formed the NFL's most successful quarterback-coach partnership with Bill Belichick, and when he left, some felt that Belichick deserved more of the credit, that Brady would get 'found out' without him. But the Patriots endured their first losing season since 2000 - the year before Brady became their starting QB - while Brady has won another Super Bowl, with a team he joined during a pandemic, after a heavily disrupted off-season with no pre-season games. It was also a team that, before this season, had not won a play-off game since winning Super Bowl 37. They had not reached the post-season at all since 2007. But Brady recognised they were gradually building a competitive roster. They had a solid offensive line that would protect him in the pocket and two of the NFL's best receivers in Mike Evans and Chris Godwin. During Super Bowl week, coach Bruce Arians said Brady was ""the missing piece"". For good measure, they brought Gronkowski out of retirement,gave Brown another chanceand picked up free agent Fournette. All came to the fore as the Bucs ramped up for an unlikely run at the Super Bowl and after Kansas City opened the scoring with a field goal, Brady found Brown twice on the next drive before sending tight end Gronkowski over with a screen pass. The pair combined to devastating effect at New England before Gronkowski retired after winning Super Bowl 53 with Brady and the Patriots. The 31-year-old had brief stints in WWE and television during his time out. But after easing back into the rigours of the NFL with seven touchdowns during the regular season, he caught a 17-yard strike by Brady for his second of Super Bowl 55. The Chiefs finally got some offence going to reply with a field goal, 61 seconds from half-time, and just as they did in theNFC Championship game against the Packers,Tampa Bay claimed a crucial score right before the half as Brady completed a 71-yard drive by finding Brown in the end zone. Kansas City rallied at the start of the second half and cut the deficit with another field goal, but the Bucs continued to dominate on both sides of the ball, stifling the NFL's best offence. Brady found Gronkowski for another big play before Fournette burst through for a 27-yard touchdown to seal a victory which many dreamed of in Tampa when Brady came aboard, but few would have thought was possible. Osi Umenyiora, two-time Super Bowl champion and former New York Giants defensive end: ""Tom Brady should be the first player in history to be in the Hall of Fame while he's still playing. What this man has done this year is almost beyond belief, almost beyond words. I cannot describe the level of difficulty, what it took for this man to do what he's done. ""Every single year this guy's been doubted, every single year this man rises to the top like a phoenix. This guy is the greatest professional athlete we have seen in history, and this goes for any sport. And I'm not just saying that to be hyperbolic. What this guy is doing in the quarterback position - the hardest position to play in sports - winning over and over again... my hat's off to this guy."" Jason Bell, former Houston Texans cornerback: ""It's all because of Brady's focus, his attention to detail. He came into the league as an underdog and he's never let it go. It drives him every single day."" On the manner of Kansas City's defeat:""This defeat is humbling for the Chiefs, no doubt. They're going to want to get the taste of this out of their mouth. This was a terrible performance and I didn't like the way they reacted to adversity, the way they were talking to each other when they got down wasn't right. They'll have to bounce back next season."" Patrick Mahomes threw for 270 yards but finished with two interceptions and was sacked three times After leading Kansas City to theirfirst Super Bowl win in 50 years,Mahomes was rewarded with a 10-year contract last July, making him the""first half-billion dollar player in sports history"". He had become the youngest player to win the Super Bowl and the NFL MVP award, and the 25-year-old is the most exciting talent of a new era of athletic quarterbacks. After steering the Chiefs back to the big game,'the Kid' now had a chance to take on 'the GOAT'in the NFL showpiece. It was the first to feature the quarterbacks who had won the previous two Super Bowls, and two starting QBs who have both won an NFL MVP and Super Bowl MVP. But Kansas City erred in all three phases of the game - slicing punts on special teams, dropping catches on offence and showing indiscipline on defence. In the first half alone, they were penalised eight times for 95 yards. After Gronkowski put the Bucs in front, the Chiefs pulled off what seemed a huge goal-line stop to prevent the hosts extending their lead. Then Tyrann Mathieu claimed an interception on Tampa Bay's next drive, only to see it cancelled out by a defensive holding call. And although they forced the Bucs to settle for a field goal, an offside put the ball back in Brady's hands to pick out Gronkowski for his second touchdown. Despite cutting the score to 14-6 just before the half, two pass interference calls allowed Tampa Bay to march right back downfield and make it a 14-point game with Brown's touchdown before Fournette's third-quarter score proved the decisive blow. ""They were the better team today, they beat us pretty good,"" said Mahomes. ""We didn't end the season the way we wanted, but we'll learn from what went right and what went wrong."" Tom Brady now has more Super Bowl wins than any NFL franchise, one clear of both the New England Patriots and Pittsburgh Steelers (6) Rob Gronkowski became the first man to make at least one catch in five Super Bowls. Brady and Gronkowski have connected for five passing touchdowns in Super Bowls, passing Joe Montana and Jerry Rice (four) for the most in Super Bowl history. Brady and Gronkowski have combined for more post-season touchdowns than any other quarterback-receiver duo all-time - 14. At 68 years and 127 days, Bruce Arians became the oldest coach to win the Super Bowl. This game saw the largest age gap between quarterbacks in Super Bowl history (18 years and 45 days). The star performed a medley of eight hits including Starboy and Blinding Lights Mark Savage, BBC music reporter The Super Bowl Half-time Show is traditionally built on grand gestures and eye-popping spectacle. Think about Lady Gaga diving off the roof of Houston's NRG stadium, or Katy Perry riding an animatronic lion, or Diana Ross soaring out of Arizona's Sun Devil Stadium, waving to fans through the open door of a helicopter. This year was a little different. Canadian R&B star The Weeknd was the interval act and, for the first time in the game's 55-year history, he was largely forced to perform from the stands, rather than the pitch, in compliance with strict coronavirus protocols. And his 12-minute show was ""watched"" by thousands of cardboard cut-outs, who bulked out the 25,000 socially-distanced fans. But the 30-year-old made the most of the restrictions with a gimmick-free show that put the emphasis on his songs. Read more of Mark's review Allow Instagram content?
