"The Archbishop of Canterbury has used his Christmas Day sermon to talk about the ""darkness"" that led to last month's London Bridge terror attack. Jack Merritt, 25, and Saskia Jones, 23, were stabbed to death by Usman Khan, who was later shot dead by police. During the service at Canterbury Cathedral, Justin Welby said the light of Jesus could bring hope. He also reflected on a visit to the Democratic Republic of Congo, which is dealing with an Ebola virus outbreak. ""Darkness is a monster that lies"", he told the congregation. ""Its growling claims seem to call out with a louder volume than the love-filled whispers of light. Archbishop worried over country's direction Archbishop calls for 'spirit of openness' Church helped homeless man off streets ""We see the shadows out of the corner of our eyes. They may be violence as in the Congo or on London Bridge; they may be political; they may be purely personal."" He continued: ""Whether solid or illusion, they are the reality with which we live. By contrast we do not see light, but we do see truth in light."" Mr Welby described Canterbury as a ""city of peace that celebrates Christmas gloriously"", before comparing it to Beni, which is five times the size of the Kent city. The archbishop said: ""It [Beni] has been at the centre of the second worst outbreak of Ebola in history; roughly 3,000 people have died. Its Anglican bishop is alight with Christ, always present, always giving of himself."" It comes after the spiritual leader of the Church of England shared a message of unity on 23 December, as he appealed to anyone who felt ""embarrassed or ashamed"" during the festive period. In a series of tweets, he spoke of Jesus' humble beginnings, appearing to direct his message to those living in poverty. He said: ""God meets us wherever we are, however messy. If you're embarrassed or ashamed, God is neither."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"Max Clifford was jailed in 2014 for a string of indecent assaults against girls and young women Disgraced publicist Max Clifford was given wrongly-labelled medication at least twice in prison before he died, a report has found. Clifford, 74, died two years ago while serving an eight-year sentence at Littlehey Prison in Cambridgeshire for historical sex offences. The Prisons and Probation Ombudsman said inmates should be monitored more closely to ensure medicine was taken. The prison's healthcare provider said it had implemented a plan to improve. The report, written in November 2018, was published,externalafter an inquest into Clifford's death concluded he had died of natural causes. On one occasion Clifford became dizzy after taking a mislabelled tablet four times the intended strength, the report said. He told staff he realised their error because of the effects of taking the 8mg tablet of a heart medication that was labelled as 2mg. Max Clifford died of natural causes, an inquest concluded After Clifford's death, ""a significant quantity"" of prescription medicine was found unused in his cell, said deputy ombudsman Richard Pickering. ""We are concerned that Mr Clifford was given incorrectly labelled medication on at least two occasions, and that staff did not monitor his medication compliance adequately at other time,"" he wrote. He also raised concerns at a delay in transferring Clifford to hospital, because staff called an urgent ambulance instead of the emergency one the GP requested. The report recommends that prison pharmacy services be reviewed to avoid medication errors, staff ensure patients take their medication and respond with greater urgency to emergency situations. Convictions against Max Clifford upheld Jail had 'chronic' heating and boiler issue Clifford died 'after cold jail complaint' Clifford died on 10 December 2017 at Hinchingbrooke Hospital, near Huntingdon, where he was taken after collapsing in the shower. His inquest heard he could have received better care if his heart condition had been diagnosed sooner. A post-mortem examination recorded the cause of death as congestive heart failure. Northamptonshire Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust, which provides healthcare at HMP Littlehey, said the coroner had accepted its action plan and evidence of implementation.

"Jeremy Bristow discovers that an ancient Christian order is providing maternity services for some of the poorest people in the Bethlehem area - the sheep-raising Bedouin. We drove through Beit Sahour, a suburb of Bethlehem. ""Beit"" in Arabic means ''house'', and ""sahour"" means ""night watch"". As tradition has it, this is close to the place where an angel once appeared before three star-struck shepherds and announced the imminent birth of a saviour. But today's shepherds, the Bedouin, live further out of town. The rock-strewn desert landscape is occasionally overlooked by glistening white Israeli settlements straddling the high ground above. Not far along the road, just outside the village of al-Rashaydah, we came across a huddle of waiting women and young children. As we drew up, our driver leapt out to unwind an awning, to shelter the growing queue from the midday sun. The van door opened and out stepped a nurse, and two women doctors - a paediatrician and a specialist in obstetrics and gynaecology. Far-flung communities depend on mobile outreach units like this one from the Holy Family Hospital in Bethlehem. The hospital is run by the Order of Malta, a successor order to the Knight's Hospitaller, which first built a hospital in Jerusalem in around 1100 AD. It treats women and children of all religions and ethnicities, regardless of ability to pay - and employs doctors and nurses of all religions and ethnicities too. All the women and children seeking treatment from the mobile medical team on this occasion were Bedouin from the al-Rashaydah tribe, whose members are scattered across a dozen countries from Tunisia to Oman. They gave their name to this village when they were moved here by the Israeli authorities, in their third resettlement since they were forced to leave historic grazing grounds near the Dead Sea in the early 1970s. A Bedouin shepherd and his flock near Jericho Some of them are still on the move. Noora was eight months pregnant. She'd just arrived from a nearby village, where her family home was bulldozed - the Israeli government said it was an illegal structure. Traditionally, Bedouins were nomads constantly in search of grazing land. Women were the shepherds, minding sheep and goats, while their menfolk guarded their territory and received visitors. But since they've become ""settled"", women have found themselves more confined to their homes. Bedouin shepherdess (1932) Al-Rashaydah, like many villages in the occupied West Bank, is surrounded by land controlled by Israel. The Bedouin are forbidden to graze their livestock there. In both Israel and the West Bank the once self-sufficient Bedouin have become increasingly dependent on outside support. They see themselves as second-class citizens. Unemployment is high, educational achievement is low and there are high rates of infant mortality, premature births, anaemia, and stunted growth in children - though Michele Bowe, the hospital's president, tells me that over the last 30 years great progress has been made in al-Rashaydah and in other Bedouin communities. The gospel of Luke says: ""And there were in the same country shepherds abiding in the field, keeping watch over their flock by night. And, lo, the angel of the Lord came upon them."" It wasn't only nomadic Bedouin who kept sheep in ancient times, villagers did too, says Joan Taylor, professor of Christian Origins and Second Temple Judaism at King's College London. The shepherds could be male or female, ""and often in antiquity, as today, they were children"". The Greek word used by Luke to refer to the shepherds is ""gender-inclusive"", she adds. See also: Were there more than three kings? Michele suggests we visit one of the families. They live in a one-storey concrete house, with a single door and no windows to the front. I was a bit nervous about being a stranger and a male. But, as soon as we entered the sparse, almost empty room, a grinning 10-year-old set out some plastic chairs for us and Khadra, his mother, offered us tea. All 10 of her children were born in the Holy Family Hospital in Bethlehem. As Michele chatted in Arabic, I walked into the kitchen. Again it was empty except for an electric hob. ""Hello, how are you?'' fluted a voice in English behind me. It was Mai, Khadra's bright-eyed and very brainy third daughter. She got record results in maths and science in her final school exams. Mai was determined to get a Maths degree. Few young Bedouin women leave home each day and travel unaccompanied. Even fewer are permitted to spend time at university among strangers. But Mai had the firm backing of her mum and two of her older, married sisters. She'd had to return at midday, missing afternoon lectures and tests, in order to catch the last affordable shuttle van home from the University of Bethlehem. Although her grades didn't suffer much, I learned that she had been unable to keep up her tuition fees - so, two years into her course, she had been forced to give up. Her family couldn't afford to pay. Mai's father, Omar, has a spinal injury and can't work, so Khadra is the principal breadwinner. For much of the year she cleans and cooks for better-off households. At harvest time she leaves home for 50 days to work on the industrial farms in the Upper Jordan valley. In this season, Mai has to look after her younger siblings. Mai's story is all too familiar among the Bedouin. Many are locked into a cycle of deprivation from which it is hard to escape. In this case, though, I was able to find some donors, who together provided a sum that will enable Mai to finish her course and Khadra to stay with her children all year round next year. Mai told me she wants to better her life, but that she doesn't want to be on the move forever. After graduating, she plans to teach maths to the children of al-Rashaydah, staying close to her home, her culture and her family. Jeremy Bristow's report from al-Rashaydah will be onFrom Our Own Correspondent on BBC Radio 4on Saturday 28 December A Palestinian Christian family that preaches non-violence from a farm in the West Bank is battling to hold on to land it has owned for a century.

"No remains of the kangaroo have been found (stock photo) A wolf has reportedly taken a privately owned kangaroo from a family's garden in Balen, north-east Belgium. Jan Loos, a wolf expert, was called to the property by the owners and said he had found wolf prints at the scene. Mr Loos told AFP the kangaroo is ""probably dead"" having been eaten by the animal. He said a second kangaroo had also been wounded in the attack. Wild wolves used to live in much of continental Europe, but their numbers have been depleted by hunting. In recent years, sightings of the animals have been on the increase and in 2018 one was recorded in Belgium for the first time in more than 100 years. Wolves return to Netherlands Reward offered over missing wolf Man rescues wild wolf from ice Mr Loos, the director of a wolf and wildlife centre called Landschap, said he believed an animal named August could be behind the animal's disappearance. The wolf has been spotted slipping across a nearby border into Germany and is known to roam the area, he said. ""I found wolf prints, so it's quite sure it's a wolf, but we're not 100 per cent sure which wolf,"" he told AFP. The expert said local wolves usually ate animals like boars and deer, but the size of a kangaroo would have made it easy to carry off. No remains of the kangaroo have been found, Mr Loos added.

"Pope Francis last week introduced sweeping changes to remove the rule of ""pontifical secrecy"" Pope Francis has ushered in Christmas by saying God loves everyone - ""even the worst of us"". He was speaking to thousands of people during Christmas Eve Mass in St Peter's Basilica at the Vatican. ""You may have mistaken ideas, you may have made a complete mess of things... but the Lord continues to love you,"" the Argentine pontiff said. This will be interpreted by some as a reference to Church scandals, including sex abuse, our correspondent says. Church abuse scandal: What you need to know Archbishop of Canterbury to reflect on attack in sermon In pictures: Christmas around the world Pope Francis will return to St Peter's Basilica later on Christmas Day to deliver the traditional papal message to the world. Among those taking part in the Mass were children chosen from countries including Venezuela, Iraq and Uganda. The BBC's Rome correspondent Mark Lowen says this is a clear gesture from the leader of 1.3 billion Catholics who often focuses on the plight of migrants and victims of war, as well as on extending the reach of the Church to its periphery. ""Christmas reminds us that God continues to love us all, even the worst of us. To me, to you, to each of us, he says today: 'I love you and I will always love you, for you are precious in my eyes,'"" the 83-year-old pontiff said. ""God does not love you because you think and act the right way. He loves you, plain and simple. His love is unconditional; it does not depend on you."" And the Pope also alluded to the clerical abuse and financial scandals afflicting the Church. ""Whatever goes wrong in our lives, whatever doesn't work in the Church, whatever problems there are in the world, will no longer serve as an excuse."" From Australian country towns to schools in Ireland and cities across the US, the Catholic Church has faced a catalogue of child sexual abuse accusations in the past few decades. High-profile cases and harrowing testimony given to public inquiries have continued to keep the issue in the headlines. This video can not be played George Pell is the most senior Catholic cleric to be convicted of such crimes In the most recent of these,Cardinal George Pell was convicted of abusing two choir boys in Melbourne in 1996. He is Australia's highest-ranking Catholic, and was previously Vatican treasurer - meaning he was widely seen as the Church's third most powerful official. Last week, the Pope introduced sweeping changes to remove the rule of ""pontifical secrecy"" that has pervaded the issue of clerical child abuse. The Church previously shrouded sexual abuse cases in secrecy, in what it said was an effort to protect the privacy of victims and reputations of the accused. But new papal documents lifted restrictions on those who report abuse or say they have been victims. The Pope also changed the Vatican's definition of child pornography, increasing the age of the subject from 14 or under to 18 or under. Pope Francis has faced serious pressure to provide leadership and generate workable solutions to the crisis, which has engulfed the Church in recent years.

"Mr Bloomberg said his campaign had terminated its relationship with a firm which operated call centres in two US jails US presidential candidate Michael Bloomberg has said that his campaign ""unknowingly"" used prison workers to call voters on his behalf. The billionaire Democrat said he had cut ties with a vendor which operates two call centres in state jails. Mr Bloomberg said he learned about the company's use of prison labour only after receiving a call from a reporter. He entered the election race in November with one of the largest-ever political ad buys. His campaign's use of prison labourwas first reported by news site The Intercept,external, and confirmed by Mr Bloomberg in a statement on Tuesday.

His net worth is $52bn (Â£40bn), according to Forbes - 17 times higher than Donald Trump. Since joining the presidential race, he has spent $59m (Â£45m) on advertising and recent polls show he has support from 5% of Democratic voters. Former Vice President Joe Biden, Senator Bernie Sanders and Senator Elizabeth Warren are currently leading the race for the party's nomination. The US has the highest incarceration rate in the world - far above other comparable industrialised nations While America's constitution outlaws slavery, the Thirteenth Amendment allows prisoners to be forced into labour for their crimes. Some labour is voluntary, while some is involuntary and non-compliance can be punished. In the past, many private firms have used so-called ""prison in-sourcing"" as an alternative to cheap labour in foreign countries. Inmates have been used for a variety of tasks like packaging Starbucks coffee and manufacturing lingerie. Prisoners were also paid $1 a day to battle wildfires in California last year. Supporters argue that the practice boosts local economies and helps to lower reconvictions by providing inmates with skills and income. But critics argue that prison labour is exploitative and prioritises private-sector profits over the rehabilitation of inmates. In 2018, incarcerated men and women took part in peaceful prison strikes across 17 US states to draw attention to jail conditions. As part of their demands, organisers called for an end to ""prison slavery"" by paying inmates proper wages. Suspected strike leaders were later punished with solitary confinement and the removal of their communication privileges.

"The Archbishop of Canterbury has used his Christmas Day sermon to talk about the ""darkness"" that led to last month's London Bridge terror attack. Jack Merritt, 25, and Saskia Jones, 23, were stabbed to death by Usman Khan, who was later shot dead by police. During the service at Canterbury Cathedral, Justin Welby said the light of Jesus could bring hope. He also reflected on a visit to the Democratic Republic of Congo, which is dealing with an Ebola virus outbreak. ""Darkness is a monster that lies"", he told the congregation. ""Its growling claims seem to call out with a louder volume than the love-filled whispers of light. Archbishop worried over country's direction Archbishop calls for 'spirit of openness' Church helped homeless man off streets ""We see the shadows out of the corner of our eyes. They may be violence as in the Congo or on London Bridge; they may be political; they may be purely personal."" He continued: ""Whether solid or illusion, they are the reality with which we live. By contrast we do not see light, but we do see truth in light."" Mr Welby described Canterbury as a ""city of peace that celebrates Christmas gloriously"", before comparing it to Beni, which is five times the size of the Kent city. The archbishop said: ""It [Beni] has been at the centre of the second worst outbreak of Ebola in history; roughly 3,000 people have died. Its Anglican bishop is alight with Christ, always present, always giving of himself."" It comes after the spiritual leader of the Church of England shared a message of unity on 23 December, as he appealed to anyone who felt ""embarrassed or ashamed"" during the festive period. In a series of tweets, he spoke of Jesus' humble beginnings, appearing to direct his message to those living in poverty. He said: ""God meets us wherever we are, however messy. If you're embarrassed or ashamed, God is neither."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"Pope Francis last week introduced sweeping changes to remove the rule of ""pontifical secrecy"" Pope Francis has ushered in Christmas by saying God loves everyone - ""even the worst of us"". He was speaking to thousands of people during Christmas Eve Mass in St Peter's Basilica at the Vatican. ""You may have mistaken ideas, you may have made a complete mess of things... but the Lord continues to love you,"" the Argentine pontiff said. This will be interpreted by some as a reference to Church scandals, including sex abuse, our correspondent says. Church abuse scandal: What you need to know Archbishop of Canterbury to reflect on attack in sermon In pictures: Christmas around the world Pope Francis will return to St Peter's Basilica later on Christmas Day to deliver the traditional papal message to the world. Among those taking part in the Mass were children chosen from countries including Venezuela, Iraq and Uganda. The BBC's Rome correspondent Mark Lowen says this is a clear gesture from the leader of 1.3 billion Catholics who often focuses on the plight of migrants and victims of war, as well as on extending the reach of the Church to its periphery. ""Christmas reminds us that God continues to love us all, even the worst of us. To me, to you, to each of us, he says today: 'I love you and I will always love you, for you are precious in my eyes,'"" the 83-year-old pontiff said. ""God does not love you because you think and act the right way. He loves you, plain and simple. His love is unconditional; it does not depend on you."" And the Pope also alluded to the clerical abuse and financial scandals afflicting the Church. ""Whatever goes wrong in our lives, whatever doesn't work in the Church, whatever problems there are in the world, will no longer serve as an excuse."" From Australian country towns to schools in Ireland and cities across the US, the Catholic Church has faced a catalogue of child sexual abuse accusations in the past few decades. High-profile cases and harrowing testimony given to public inquiries have continued to keep the issue in the headlines. This video can not be played George Pell is the most senior Catholic cleric to be convicted of such crimes In the most recent of these,Cardinal George Pell was convicted of abusing two choir boys in Melbourne in 1996. He is Australia's highest-ranking Catholic, and was previously Vatican treasurer - meaning he was widely seen as the Church's third most powerful official. Last week, the Pope introduced sweeping changes to remove the rule of ""pontifical secrecy"" that has pervaded the issue of clerical child abuse. The Church previously shrouded sexual abuse cases in secrecy, in what it said was an effort to protect the privacy of victims and reputations of the accused. But new papal documents lifted restrictions on those who report abuse or say they have been victims. The Pope also changed the Vatican's definition of child pornography, increasing the age of the subject from 14 or under to 18 or under. Pope Francis has faced serious pressure to provide leadership and generate workable solutions to the crisis, which has engulfed the Church in recent years.
