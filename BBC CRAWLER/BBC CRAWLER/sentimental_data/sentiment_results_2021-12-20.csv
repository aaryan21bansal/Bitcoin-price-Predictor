"This video can not be played Jason Leitch says there are things we can do to ""make the peak smaller, perhaps even delay it"" Scotland is ""nowhere near"" the peak of the Omicron wave, with cases likely to double or treble in coming days, the national clinical director has said. Jason Leitch told BBC Scotland that models suggested a late January or early February peak and a sharp rise in deaths and hospital admissions. But Prof Leitch said Scotland was not ""powerless"" and could fight to reduce or delay the peak. A return to stricter lockdown measure was also not ""inevitable"", he added. Omicron is much more infectious than previous Covid strains and now accounts for nearly 60% of all Scottish infections,according to Scottish government figures,external. Total daily cases have been rising since the end of November, when Omicron was first detected in Scotland. More than 6,700 new cases were confirmed on Monday and Public Health Scotland said many results had been delayed because of the ""larger volumes"" of tests being processed by labs. The percentage of positive tests also reached 15.2% - the highest it has been since January. Speaking onBBC Radio Scotland's Lunchtime Live programme, Prof Leitch said: ""Positive cases were rising over the weekend. We approached over 5,000 - I'm expecting that to go up again today and for the rest of this week. ""I'm afraid we're not in the foothills any more of this Omicron wave, we're in it."" In leaked minutes seen by the BBC last week, the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies suggested that if no further restrictions were introduced, UK hospital admissions could peak at between 3,000 and 10,000 a day - and deaths between 600 and 6,000. Prof Leitch said this could translate to between 60 and 600 Covid deaths a day in Scotland, but added there was not yet enough data on Omicron to know for sure. He told BBC Scotland that hospital admissions for Covid would begin to rise soon, reflecting the recent increase in cases. ""We are very hopeful that Omicron might not be as severe, so you might not get as many hospitalisations per 100 people,"" he said. ""But the fact you're going to get double, treble the number of cases means it's not long before our hospitals really struggle - and our hospitals are already finding it very challenging because of winter, postponed care, other diseases and some Covid."" More than 10,000 new Omicron cases found in UK Why more Omicron restrictions may cause harm Covid in Scotland: Where are the latest cases? Prof Leitch said it was not inevitable that hospitals would be overwhelmed, but warned of ""difficult choices"" around patient care as they became ""very, very busy"". ""The modelling suggests the peak of this wave is a little bit unpredictable, but probably into late January, early February, so that gives you some idea of where we're headed,"" he said. ""But we're not powerless. There are things we can do to make that peak smaller and perhaps even delay it to give us more time, because the more we delay, the more we vaccinate."" He said it was key that people reduced their socialising as much as they could and maintained social distancing with people outside their household. A speedy booster programme is considered vital in tackling the threat of Omicron as the third dose appears to offer much more protection against the strain. The Scottish government has saidit wants to give the booster to 80% of all eligible adultsby the end of the year, and the number of daily vaccinations has gone up to more than 60,000 a day since the end of last week. But the sharp rise in cases has led to hints thattougher Covid restrictions could be introducedaround the new year. Prof Leitch told BBC Scotland that Omicron needed a ""fast and hard"" response, but said a full lockdown was not ""inevitable"". ""I don't think we'll go back to what we knew as lockdown right at the beginning, [because of] the other harms - economic, educational, the mental health harms,"" he said. ""I think the politicians around the world will have to consider other protections, but that will depend on the state of the pandemic and their environment - Scotland included - but also dependent on what you can do financially.""

"Sir Richard Sutton's wealth was valued at Â£301m in the 2020 Sunday Times Rich List A man who killed one of the UK's richest men and paralysed his own mother in a ""ferocious"" knife attack has been given a life sentence. Thomas Schreiber fatally stabbed 83-year-old Sir Richard Sutton at his home near Gillingham, Dorset, in April. The 35-year-old also attacked his mother Anne Schreiber, who was Sir Richard's partner. He was convicted of murder and attempted murder. He was jailed for a minimum of 36 years at Winchester Crown Court. Armed police were called to Moorhill, Sir Richard's home in Higher Langham that he shared with both Anne and Thomas Schreiber, at 19:30 BST on 7 April. Ms Schreiber was ""barely conscious"" when she was discovered in the kitchen, before being carried out by police officers to waiting paramedics. Sir Richard was found dead outside his upstairs bedroom. He had suffered multiple stab wounds. Thomas Schreiber had been living at the home Sir Richard shared with his mother Anne Schreiber Prosecutor Adam Feest QC told the trial: ""This was a ferocious and sustained attack on both victims."" The trial heard Schreiber was angry with his mother for ""abandoning"" his late father, who suffered from depression, to move in with Sir Richard. He accused her of being a ""gold-digger"" and believed Sir Richard treated him unfairly compared to his two sisters. This was despite Schreiber, an aspiring painter, receiving a Â£1,000 monthly allowance and Â£100,000 towards buying a house. The trial heard he had earlier told a friend he ""couldn't stand"" Sir Richard, writing in a message: ""My mind is consumed with hatred of the worst kind."" ""I contemplate murdering them... I want them to suffer,"" he added. Sir Richard and Ms Schreiber had been together since about 2003 Reading her victim impact statement in court, Schreiber's sister Rose McCarthy sobbed as she told him: ""You took a knife to our world. ""In doing so you took away Richard, you took away the most innocent and kindest of men in the most brutal of ways. ""You also killed our mother, you took her life away and left her trapped in a body she can't use and is in constant pain."" Sir Richard's son, Sir David Sutton, also read a statement in which he said he felt ""intense anger, sadness and distress"" at the death of his father. ""It was so completely unnecessary,"" he said. ""I feel robbed of the times we had discussed and planned."" This video can not be played Police were called to Sir Richard's Moorhill estate near Gillingham in Dorset Passing sentence Mr Justice Garnham told Schreiber his actions had caused ""utter devastation"" in both families. He added: ""You treated Sir Richard's house and possessions as if they were your own. ""You showed neither him or your mother any respect, instead during your time in their home you displayed a breathtaking sense of entitlement, at times you left Sir Richard feeling like a prisoner in his own home."" He told Schreiber that on the night of 7 April: ""You completely lost your temper"", and subjected the couple to a ""vicious attack"". Schreiber admitted manslaughter, as well as driving a Range Rover dangerously in a high-speed chase as he fled to London after the attack. He was eventually detained by police on Chiswick High Road. Schreiber was pursued by police at speeds of up to 135mph as he fled towards central London Sir Richard was listed at number 435 in the Sunday Times Rich List last year with an estimated family fortune of Â£301 million, an increase of Â£83 million on the previous year. The guide said his company owned London hotels the Sheraton Grand Park Lane and the Athenaeum, plus three smaller venues. He also had an extensive property and farming portfolio, including the 6,500-acre Benham Estate in west Berkshire and the Stainton Estate in Lincolnshire. In a statement the Sutton family said Sir Richard was a ""warm and compassionate"" father-of-two and grandfather-of-five. It said: ""The British countryside has lost an amazing champion, who was above all an active and committed farmer."" Follow BBC South onFacebook,external,Twitter,external, orInstagram,external.

"This video can not be played Woman filmed kicking and hitting horse A primary school teacher has been sacked after a video showing a horse being hit by a woman went viral. Footagewas shared online last monthby anti-hunt group Hertfordshire Hunt Saboteurs who said it showed members of the Cottesmore Hunt in Leicestershire. At the time Mowbray Education Trust said Sarah Moulds had been suspended during a formal investigation and the RSPCA was also investigating. The trust has now said the teacher has been dismissed. Investigations were started by the education trust and RSPCA after the footage was released Hertfordshire Hunt Saboteurs said the video was filmed near Sewstern in Leicestershire. It was viewed more than two million times and condemned on social media by celebrities such as Judy Murray, Russell Tovey and John Bishop - who described it as ""inexcusable"". Paul Maddox, chief operating officer of the Mowbray Education Trust, said in a statement: ""I can confirm that Sarah Moulds' employment with the trust has been terminated. ""As a trust we are committed to ensuring the best standard of education for all of our young people and we look forward to continuing this throughout the 2021/22 academic year and beyond."" Ms Moulds was also removed from a volunteering role she carried out for the Pony Club, which said of the video: ""We wholeheartedly condemn this behaviour"". The Cottesmore Hunt also told the BBC they ""strongly disapprove of any such actions"" and would ""deal with it in an appropriate manner"".

"This video can not be played Footage appears to show debt collectors breaking into the flat of someone who has never been a Scottish Power customer Scottish Power debt enforcers have been caught on camera breaking into a woman's flat seeking payment for debts she did not owe. The woman was on holiday at the time and was not a Scottish Power customer. Doorbell video footage shows two uniformed men tampering with locks before going into the flat and identifying themselves as Scottish Power representatives. The energy firm has admitted the error, apologised and offered compensation. It is the latest in a series of reports from BBC Scotland featuring allegations of heavy-handed measures by representatives of Scottish Power. The UK energy regulator Ofgem has now opened discussions with Scottish Power following the claims. Probe into 'aggressive' energy debt tactics Woman 'harassed' by power firm over false debt The woman's father said his daughter was on holiday in the north of Scotland on 20 August when she received an alert from the video doorbell. Donald Maciver, 60, said she saw there were two men at the door and she realised they were trying to break into the flat. ""She tried to engage with them through the intercom and they chose to ignore that, and then watched for a period of 43 seconds as two guys walked through the door,"" he said. This video can not be played Scottish Power debt enforcement team raid wrong home Mr Maciver said he drove from his home in St Andrews to the property in Glasgow to investigate. ""I got down there and walked into the flat and couldn't see anything,"" he said. ""It was like nobody had been there, it was absolutely nothing there at all. If it hadn't been for the video footage, nobody would have known anyone had been in this flat. ""Yet two men were in this flat for 27 minutes, nobody can explain to me what they were doing in a two-bedroom flat for 27 minutes. They were supposed to be looking for gas meters - a gas meter that happens to be in the basement."" Mr Maciver later found a letter from a debt collection firm addressed to someone who did not live in any of the flats that shared his daughter's stairwell. He said his daughter had reported the letters three times to Scottish Power but they kept sending written demands for unpaid money. Mr Maciver said he faced a ""denial culture"" at the energy firm when he tried to complain. ""Even though you're not the customer - never have been a customer - you are wrong, they are right,"" he said. ""It's up to you to prove you don't owe them money as opposed to them proving to you that you do."" He eventually received a letter in which Scottish Power admitted the error after contacting the CEO's office. It states: ""I sincerely apologised that we had attended the wrong address and I confirmed that your daughter's property was supplied by SSE. ""In view of the upset caused, I offered your daughter Â£500 as a gesture of goodwill and advised you that we were continuing to investigate which flat we do supply, your daughters' details were removed from our system."" Irene Girvan said she felt she was not being listened to It follows the case of Irene Girvan, from Glasgow, who claimed the energy giant hounded her for a year over money she insists she did not owe. The 64-year-old told BBC Scotland she was threatened with debt collectors and missed a Covid booster jab while waiting for enforcement officers she believed were coming to change her locks. Scottish Power has apologised for distress caused to Ms Girvan and cleared the debt. Officials said there was ""no excuse for our failures"" in this case. An Ofgem spokeswoman said:  ""We treat seriously all allegations of customers not being treated fairly, and take action where appropriate. ""We have contacted Scottish Power over their investigation into the allegations reported by the BBC. ""Debt management activities must be done in a fair and reasonable way at all times. Suppliers cannot extend unlimited credit to customers, but we will not tolerate sharp practice or aggressive debt collection."" On Friday, Scottish Power launched a probe after a whistleblower told the BBC that call handlers working on behalf of the energy giant were told to threaten customers with debt enforcement - even over mistaken bills. The man, an employee of an outsourced company, works in a call centre in the west of Scotland dealing with people who call to query outstanding balances. The employee, who says he wants to protect his identity over fears he will lose his job, said it was clear to see where errors had been made on an account. He said: ""It may be a wrong meter reading, they've not been billed correctly, they might not be responsible for it, or they're not a Scottish Power customer. However, until that's dealt with then it's going to stand, we're going pursue them for that debt. A Scottish Power spokesman said: ""Scottish Power does not have processes or is it our intention to pursue account holders who have not been customers of Scottish Power. ""Like every other energy company in the UK we will follow up any existing debt a Scottish Power customer owes after they have switched to another supplier. ""Your source's allegations on our debt management policies are all untrue."" Following the volume of people getting in touch with the BBC raising concerns, Scottish Power has asked people to email Contactus@scottishpower.com with BBC Account Query in the title.

"Fans have had to use a Covid-19 pass in order to attend fixtures in recent weeks Premier League and EFL clubs have chosen to fulfil festive fixtures despite ongoing Covid-19 disruption. The decision comes despite Premier League players and club staff returning a record 90 positive tests last week. The Premier League's 20 clubs met on Monday to discuss the fixture list after six weekend games were postponed. No vote took place and so two rounds of fixtures are in place across five days from 26 December, while the EFL will play games ""where it is safe to do so"". It had been expected that the Premier League's gameweek 20, starting on 28 December, would be postponed in order to ease the pressure on Premier League squads. BBC Sport understands one discussion point at the meeting was for each club to play two fixtures over the festive period across three gameweeks, meaning no individual gameweek would have been fully postponed. Instead, clubs have been advised if they have 13 fit players, plus a goalkeeper, they should fulfil their games. FA Cup replays in rounds three and four have however been scrappedand talks are ongoing on whether to reduce EFL Cup semi-final ties to one-leg matches. Shortly after the meeting, the Premier League confirmed there had been 90 new positive cases from 12,345 tests on players and staff between 13 and 19 December. The figure was more than double last week's 42 cases, which was a record since the pandemic began. Jude Bellingham 'would advise' footballers to get vaccinated against Covid On Monday, Premier League figures showed 77% of players have had two vaccination jabs, a rise from 68% in October. In all, 84% of players have had at least one vaccination. If staff are included in the analysis the figure rises to 92%. There were 44 positive tests in the Women's Super League and Championship last week - the highest figure since the leagues began releasing test data. The Premier League said Monday's meeting saw ""a range of issues discussed"" including adapting the Covid-19 postponement process. Saturday's fixture between Aston Villa and Burnley wascalled off at two hours' notice. In Sunday's Premier League fixtures, Chelsea named just six substitutes for their draw at Wolves and Liverpool drew at Tottenham without a number of first-team names. Five of Saturday's six fixtures were called off. Chelsea tried to get Sunday's fixture at Wolves postponed and boss Thomas Tuchel said his players were put at ""huge risk... not just because of Covid but also physically"". It is understood Liverpool were among a group of clubs who pushed for the postponement of gameweek 20. After Sunday's draw at Spurs, Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp said playing on 26 and 28 December was not feasible. ""It's impossible, we don't have the players,"" Klopp said. ""We have to think we will get an extra case or two. We cannot just push it all through. The 26th and 28th, that's not possible. We would prefer to play but we need help with the fixtures."" The seven Premier League teams still in the Carabao Cup face ties on 21 and 22 December and will play three Premier League fixtures between then and 2 January. Wolves club tweeted a photo of captain Conor Coady and head coach Bruno Lage having their booster jabs. Lage added on Monday: ""Everyone in our building is fully vaccinated, which is the right thing to do, especially with the increase in positive cases in the Premier League and wider society.""

Two Championship matches and five League Two games on 26 December havealready been called offbecause of positive Covid-19 cases. The EFL said it anticipates further postponements but sees ""optimism that disruption can be minimised"". EFL chief executive Trevor Birch said: ""We will continue to work with clubs, authorities and other agencies to monitor the Covid-19 case rate and be prepared to respond accordingly, yet for now the view remains that we can continue to deliver games safely where clubs have sufficient healthy personnel in place, on and off the pitch. ""With club mitigation measures, the mass adoption of booster jabs and Covid certification now required for larger crowds, we are sure many fans will continue to feel confident in attending matches over the Christmas period and we look forward to welcoming them."" BBC Sport football reporter Simon Stone: There was discussion about a two-week circuit break at Monday's Premier League shareholders' meeting but there was not enough support for it to come close to being implemented. In the end, uncertainty over what lies ahead won the day - and some realities were reinforced. Chelsea boss Thomas Tuchel wanted Sunday's game at Wolves to be called off. The request was turned down. It was noted his squad contained two outfield substitutes who cost Â£55m - and in Saul Niguez's case an option to buy for Â£30m. They also have, by any criteria, one of the best academies in world football. The feeling within the game is that Tuchel - and managerial colleagues in the same situation - should get on with it and use the talent at their disposal and that having the ""best"" squad is different to having ""a"" squad. Clubs do not know what the future holds. Rumours abound about lockdown restrictions returning, which would slash attendances and income from the turnstiles. Knowing that is a possibility, the clubs are reluctant to agree to a pause that they might not need. Ten Premier League games already need to be rescheduled in a calendar that had no room for them until the FA removed the week allocated for third round replays in January. There has been discussion about whether the EFL Cup semi-finals next month should revert to one game rather than the usual two. Any decision around that will be impacted by whether this week's quarter-finals go ahead - and what the overall situation in the country is like. As always debate around the players is intense. Urged to return to the field during the first stages of the pandemic, now conversation is about whether they should stop. The Professional Footballers' Association, like the clubs, continues to urge members to get vaccinated while trying to ensure players are not used as pawns in a wider PR game.

"NHS spending in Wales will jump next year to tackle record high waiting times created by Covid. An extra Â£893m will be pumped in during 2022, as part of the Â£24.6bn Welsh government budget. More cash has also been promised for councils, and Labour Finance Minister Rebecca Evans said the budget will help make Wales ""a fairer nation"". Welsh Conservatives said the budget had been made possible after record funding from the UK government. Shops and hospitality will get a 50% cut to business rates - a relief to some firms waiting to hear if there would be any help for the tax from April. Plaid Cymru said the spending plans will deliver a ""stronger"" Wales, following the party's co-operation agreement with Welsh Labour ministers. Welsh government cash boost as families squeezed Millions to be worse off in 2022, says think tank What's in the chancellor's Budget for Wales? The Welsh government say that over three years it will provide Â£1.3bn in extra direct funding to the Welsh NHS. Most of that - Â£893m - will arrive in the first financial year. That is a 10.7% increase on the current budget, or 7.8% when inflation is taken into account, with smaller increases in later years. Numbers waiting for treatmentshit record levelslast August. Budget documents say the government's ""highest priority is to address the backlog of treatments that have been delayed by the pandemic"". Helen Whyley of the Royal College of Nurses said a significant portion has to be spent on NHS salaries, with 1,719 vacancies in Wales. The union is currently in dispute with the Welsh government over pay. ""You can have all the money in the world for services,"" Ms Whyley said. ""But if you don't have the staff to care for patients, and to deliver that care safely, it won't buy you anything."" Despite the rise in day-to-day spending, funding for health care facilities will fall from Â£377m to Â£279m next year. Firms were worried they would face higher bills after the pandemic The Welsh NHS Confederation, which represents health organisations, said its ""members are disappointed in the lack of investment in capital infrastructure to improve and redesign NHS estates and facilities"". Cardiff University's Guto Ifan said the planned increase for NHS spending in Wales appears to be ""slightly below"" extra cash for Wales triggered because of NHS spending in England. ""There are huge uncertainties about the medium-term impact of the pandemic and these spending plans could well need to be revised upwards in later years."" Council funding will increase by Â£384m to Â£5.1bn - 8.1% in nominal terms or 5.2% when inflation is taken into account. Officials say this is the largest increase to the cash for local government - which is spent on social care and other services - since devolution began. Mr Ifan said councils should be able to meet their spending needs next year ""with relatively low increases in council tax"". The announcement follows a promise of more cash for Welsh public services from the Treasury, which provides the lion's share of the Welsh government's money. Experts at Cardiff University sayÂ£2.9bn will be available to spend by 2024. It also comes afteran agreementbetween the Welsh government and Plaid Cymru which included free school meals over three years and expanding free childcare to two-year-olds. Both were included in the budget, with Â£30m for early years and childcare, and Â£90m for free school meals over three years. The Vale Resort is starting to recover after a difficult 21 months According to the Welsh government, businesses in retail, leisure and hospitality will receive 50% rates relief for 2022-23, matching similar plans announced by Chancellor Rishi Sunak for England. It will be less than the 100% discount many such firms receive now. The scheme will be capped at Â£110,000 per business. With other relief schemes ministers say 85,000 properties will be supported, while a further Â£35m will be spent to freeze rates for 2022-23. Despite the announcement, Michael Manghan and Rhian Davies, who run the Crown and Sceptre in Cadoxton, Neath, are still concerned for what 2022 will hold. Ms Davies feared the rate bill they would now need to pay was a ""big chunk of money to find"". She said she would have like to have seen more, but added: ""It's better than nothing."" Mr Manghan said: ""The money we've lost over the last year - we're only just coming back to repay people."" Michael Manghan and Rhian Davies are concerned for the future of the business Sam Dabb, who runs Le Pub in Newport, was pleased to hear the news. ""It's one of the main costs of the business, it's absolutely massive."" One businessman said the Welsh government definitely had to meet the 50% cut introduced in England, and warned next year could be tough. The Vale Resort in Hensol, Vale of Glamorgan, is starting to recover after a difficult 21 months. Bookings have increased since Covid restrictions were lifted and the company has opened a distillery on site to expand the business. Its managing director, Stephen Leeke, said government support schemes such as furlough, business rate relief and the Economic Resilience Fund (ERF) had helped the company stay afloat. He said: ""There's certainly an argument to say that they might consider going further, because I think we are in for a bit of a roller coaster now in the next couple of months and I don't think there's any doubt the industry will need some support."" The Welsh government said it would spend Â£1.8bn on investments in its climate change department over three years, which includes Â£1.6bn on housing. Of that, Â£1bn will be spent on housing and Â£375m for building safety. Finance Minister Rebecca Evans said the Welsh government was still operating in a ""difficult financial context with our budget nearly Â£3bn lower than if it had increased in line with the economy since 2010-11"". ""This budget will support the Wales of today and shape the Wales of tomorrow. It will support our public services to be stronger, put Wales further down the path to being a net zero nation, and create a fairer nation with equality at its heart,"" she said. Welsh Conservative finance spokesman Peter Fox said: ""Today's budget has been made possible by the Conservative government delivering record funding for Wales. ""In that light, I welcome the much-needed business rates holiday to help firms recover from the ongoing challenges of the pandemic, along with an important uplift in funding for our local authorities who deliver so many key services in communities across Wales."" Llyr Gruffydd, Plaid Cymru finance spokesperson, said: ""Thanks to Plaid Cymru, this budget will deliver an even fairer, even greener, even stronger Wales through ambitious policy pledges. ""From free school meals for all primary pupils to extending free childcare to all two-year olds and much more, the commitments secured by Plaid Cymru as part of the co-operation agreement with Welsh government will secure transformational support for some of our poorest households and will change people's lives for the better across Wales."" There will be relief among the many thousands working in hospitality, retail and leisure across Wales. The Welsh government has matched what is happening in England and business rates for those industries will be halved. Most of them will still struggle to pay that as the pandemic continues to play havoc with trade with fewer people out shopping. With a new Welsh government department focused on climate change, it's hardly surprising that it's getting more money. What is interesting, and tells us about the departments priorities, is that of the Â£1.8bn for capital spending by the climate change minister almost all of it (Â£1.6bn) is to improve the quality and supply of housing. This budget is taking the long term view even though the immediate economic landscape is extremely fragile.

"From Monday, an extra 18 trains will be added to the Cardiff and London Paddington timetable A half-hourly train service between south Wales and London is to return from Monday. An extra 18 trains are being reintroduced between Cardiff and London Paddington from 20 December, restoring trains cut due to Covid. Great Western Rail is also starting an all-electric train service between the two stations for the first time. The rail operator said the new timetable would provide communities with needed ""help and support"". Trains fundamentally safe, says Welsh rail boss Climate change: What's the impact on rail? The introduction of an all-electric Class 387 service between Cardiff and London began with a limited weekend service, plus an early-morning service on weekdays, from 18 December. Great Western Rail said this would provide a low carbon, sustainable way to supplement capacity on the popular route. In the future, the rail operator said it can provide extra, up to 12-carriage capacity, for events at the Principality Stadium. Some busy train services for matches at the Principality Stadium have attracted criticism from passengers Welsh rugby final sees more packed trains from Cardiff Better links between Wales and England recommended Jess Morden, the MP for Newport East, said she thought the return of the half-hourly services between stations in south Wales and London was ""really important"". ""We're seeing more people now using the trains again and it's really important in terms of climate change and decarbonisation,"" she said. Great Western Rail also said services would be extended from Cardiff through to Penzance, better connecting south west England with south Wales. It is part of wider December timetable change improvements being made by Great Western Rail making across the south. Mark Hopwood, Great Western Rail's managing director, said the new timetable would ""provide our communities with the help and support they need, as together we rebuild and renew for the future"". ""Good rail services are key to economic recovery and to decarbonisation,"" he said. The rail operator is encouraging customers to travel safely, including to wear a face covering, wash hands regularly and to buy tickets online, via smart card or app. BACKYARD BREEDERS:Breaking the law in brutal designer dog trade worth tens of thousands of pounds STORIES FROM WALES :Documentaries for curious minds Trains fundamentally safe, says rail boss Next train is the first to the city since 1962 Better links between Wales and England recommended Wales v Australia results in more packed trains Comments can not be loaded To load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browser Night-time curfew imposed in fire-hit areas of LA as police warn against 'despicable' looting 'I have nothing to go back to' - BBC reporter tells of LA fires heartbreak Trump avoids prison or fine in hush-money case sentencing LA fires: How three days of devastation unfolded What's the latest on the Los Angeles wildfires and what caused them?

"Elon Musk, the world's richest person, has tweeted he will pay $11bn (Â£8.3bn) in tax for this year. Mr Musk has been embroiled in a public debate on social media over how much tax he pays. Earlier this week, Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren tweeted that Mr Musk should stop ""freeloading off everyone else"". ""For those wondering, I will pay over $11bn in taxes this year,"" the billionaire responded. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Mr Musk, co-founder of electric car maker Tesla and aerospace manufacturer SpaceX, became the world's richest person earlier this year. Bloomberg Billionaires Index puts his wealth at $243bn, while Tesla is worth around $1tn and SpaceX is worth $100bn. Last week, Mr Musk was named Time Magazine's Person of the Year. That prompted Senator Warren to tweet: ""Let's change the rigged tax code so 'The Person of the Year' will actually pay taxes and stop freeloading off everyone else."" Allow Twitter content?

US President Joe Biden is keen to increase taxes on the ultra-rich, although legislative plans have so far stalled in Congress. Some senators, including Ms Warren, have backed the idea of taxing not only the income of America's richest citizens, but also the rising value of the assets they hold, like shares. Many of America's wealthiest citizens don't take a directly taxable salary. Instead, they hold their wealth in shares and other investments, then take out loans using those assets as collateral. This video can not be played How billionaires pay less tax than you Mr Musk responded to Senator Warren's tweet, saying he would be paying ""more taxes than any American in history this year"". Columbia University professor and tax expert, Robert Willens, said that was likely to be a fair comment from Mr Musk, who had made himself liable for ""mind-boggling amounts of taxable income"" in 2020, through exercising stock options that would otherwise have expired and been worthless. Stock options are agreements that the holder can purchase a stock at a set price in the future. The current value of Tesla shares is significantly higher than when Mr Musk was granted the original stock options, so the value he gains by exercising those options would be considerable and would count as taxable income, added Mr Willens. ""[Mr Musk] probably felt it would be prudent to generate as much taxable income in 2021 as possible, on the theory that income in 2022 might be taxed at higher rates,"" he explained. Musk makes whistleblower joke with new Tesla item Watch: Who is Elon Musk?k Senator vows to sink key Biden spending plan If some of Congress' more radical measures were enacted, that would have had a big impact on Mr Musk's tax liabilities, Mr Willens added. The bulk of Mr Musk's tax payment, to be made next year, will go to federal tax authorities, but the state of California, where Tesla and Mr Musk have been based until recently, will also claim a portion. Earlier this month, Tesla announced in a US Securities Exchange Corporation (SEC) filing that it was moving its corporate headquarters to Texas - a plan Mr Musk had hinted at in media interviews for several months, citing unhappiness with the Californian state government laws and criticising the high cost of living in Silicon Valley. Texas has more lenient tax rules - it does not collect income tax, in contrast to California, which has the highest income tax rates among US states, according to thinktank the Tax Foundation. Over the last few weeks, Mr Musk has sold around $14bn of Tesla shares, which Mr Willens said was likely to be in part in order to generate cash to satisfy his tax liabilities. While the numbers involved in the case of Mr Musk were exceptional, this was a standard approach for a corporate executive to take to expiring stock options, he added.

"Fraudsters are directing people on Facebook to sites claiming to sell fake Covid vaccine passes for those who have not been jabbed, the BBC has found. People in the UK are required to prove their vaccination status in order to access some places and to avoid self-isolation after travelling abroad. But posts on the social media site are offering unvaccinated people false certification to get around the rules. Facebook said it would remove the content ""whenever we find it"". NHS Covid passes were introduced in England in some settings, as part of the UK government's Plan B measures in the wake of the Omicron coronavirus variant spreading rapidly. To receive a pass the recipient must prove that they have been vaccinated with two doses of an approved vaccine, have completed a negative PCR test or negative rapid lateral flow test within the past 48 hours or are exempt from vaccination or vaccination and testing on the basis of a medical exemption or clinical trial participation. ""We were finding passes, certificates, cards, vaccine cards, even down to choice of what vaccine you wanted recording on the card,"" said Jonathan Benton, who runs cyber investigation firm Intelligent Sanctuary. Where will I need to use a Covid passport? Can the US crack down on fake vaccination cards? Mr Benton, a former senior detective, said a range of passes were available for sale, ranging from some which are legitimate cards but fraudulently filled in, to complete forgeries. Covid certificates have been found for sale alongside drugs, weapons and stolen goods on the dark web, with sellers claiming to provide documentation from many countries, including the US and the EU. A government spokesperson said: ""Fraud is a crime and falsifying evidence of Covid-19 status could not only put lives at risk but lead to a Â£10,000 fine. ""The NHS Covid Pass is a safe, secure and free way for individuals to share their Covid-19 vaccination record - it includes rigorous security features to minimise the risk of fraud and help organisations authenticate the Covid Pass presented to them. ""We continue to work closely with law enforcement and partners to tackle online scams, including Covid-19 related fraud."" In one post, one seller claimed to be able to provide certificates from 22 countries including Portugal, France, Greece, Spain, Australia, Latvia, Morocco and the UK. They were not only offering paper certificates, but purported to be able to provide national health authority Covid apps with QR codes, because they said they worked with people inside health authorities, who would able to add information to the database. ""Sadly, I would say [that claim] is probably highly credible,"" said Mr Benton, who also previously worked for the National Crime Agency (NCA). Mr Benton said it was difficult to know who is behind such sales, but he and his team believed organised crime groups were involved, with more criminals moving to online spaces. ""If I'm committing organised, violent crime out there on the street, and there's a risk of me getting caught and then going to prison for 10 years, versus being behind the screen of a laptop having a number of people committing fraud, I'm going to naturally migrate to that place,"" he said. Meanwhile, on Facebook, the BBC found several examples of posts or comments claiming to be selling Covid vaccination certificates for people who had not been jabbed. The posts advertised that passes would help people keep their jobs, attend events or travel more easily. And while some posts were taken down within a few days by Facebook, the BBC reported 10 posts and comments. The majority were taken down within 24 hours, but more posts and comments have appeared again on the same pages since then. The BBC also found several Facebook posts linked to channels on encrypted messaging app Telegram which offered to sell Covid certificates to unvaccinated people. Analysis by the BBC and cyber-security firm Checkpoint found that over a seven-month period between December 2020 and July 2021, Telegram channels offering Covid passes for unvaccinated people in multiple languages grew from below 10 to more than 1,000. Telegram channels are being used to sell fake Covid vaccination certificates to people One Telegram channel claiming to offer NHS and EU digital Covid passports has amassed more than 180,000 subscribers since 14 December. The BBC has contacted Telegram for comment. For Mr Benton, the task of catching fraudsters is a difficult one, and counterfeiting is ""impossible"" to stop. ""If you look at the sites that we are looking at, where you've got passes or QR passes for sale. On those same websites they are selling illegal drugs, firearms, a number of illicit materials,"" he said. ""Frankly law enforcement are struggling to keep on top of it and understand who is behind selling these goods. I can't see how they can possibly police it."" The problem of forged Covid passes is not new or unique to the UK, with fraudsters alsoadvertising fake Covid certificates in the US. For $100 (Â£70), one vendor said they could deliver a ""registered"" card, with either the logo of the US Centers for Diseases Control and Prevention (CDC) or the NHS. It is difficult to know how many fake passes are in circulation, but according to one Border Force union, some have been used to try to get into the UK. Lucy Moreton of the Immigration Services Union said fake passes had been available ever since official vaccination documentation was introduced. ""When border force were checking, we were seeing a significant minority. We would get a number of them every single day and we've no reason to believe that's changed,"" she added. The Immigration Services Union says border immigration queues would be unmanageable if extensive checks into the validity of Covid passports were to be introduced Earlier this year, Border Force was directed to stop checking people's Covid documentation and airlines have been doing so instead. ""Because Border Force no longer check routinely, we don't know how prevalent these are and how much this is actually being used and being missed by the airlines who are understandably not forgery experts,"" said Ms Moreton. She said spotting fakes was ""no different from spotting an email scam"", but added there was ""no model"" for extensive checks and that border queues would ""become really unmanageable"". But, she says, returning to paperwork checks would cause other problems. ""There's no model for running the UK border extends to controlling British citizen in a process that takes 10-12 minutes If we were to check from every individual, rapidly the queues would become really unmanageable."" The Labour Party said the UK needed ""much stronger action"" against this type of online crime and called on the Home Office to ""urgently make sure the border Covid system isn't full of gaps because of fake documents"". A statement from Meta, which owns Facebook, said it prohibited anyone from buying, selling, or trading fake, or even genuine, medical documents on its platforms. ""We'll continue to identify and remove this content whenever we find it, and will disable accounts, pages or groups that repeatedly break our rules,"" the company added.

"Bob Marley musical Get Up, Stand Up! was among those cancelled over the weekend Almost half of London's major theatres were forced to cancel performances this weekend because of Covid infections, as Omicron plays havoc with live events. Of the 46 full members of the Society of London Theatre that had shows running, 22 scrapped performances. They included Hamilton, Matilda, Wicked, The Lion King, Cinderella, Cabaret and Come From Away. Producer Sir Cameron Mackintosh said it was ""hugely disruptive"" and the industry was in a ""dreadful state"". He told BBC News: ""It's literally day-to-day. We spend all morning trying to work out if we can do the show or not. ""The important thing is, when we do it, it is safe, and the public have been remarkable in that they are, in our experience, turning up mostly to the shows."" However, bookings for the first part of 2022 are well below expectations, which is ""really worrying for almost everybody across the business"", he said. ""It's understandable why, but this is why we desperately need the government to step in and help the commercial theatre, because by and large the commercial theatre hasn't had any help at all across the pandemic. ""We've all used our reserves to get the shows back up. At the point that we're trying to recoup some of our losses, we are in a dreadful state at the moment and desperately need the government to help commercial theatre going through the next few weeks."" Most commercial theatres, which covers the mainstream West End and big regional venues that host hit shows, were not eligible for the government's Culture Recovery Fund. Les Miserables was called off in the West End on Sunday There have been numerous cancellations elsewhere in the country after outbreaks among casts or crews, with performances of Six and The Book of Mormon called off at the Lowry in Salford and the Palace Theatre in Manchester respectively. In Leeds, Bedknobs and Broomsticks could not be staged over the weekend at the Grand Theatre, and Wendy & Peter Pan succumbed at Leeds Playhouse. There was no White Christmas at the Edinburgh Playhouse on Saturday or Sunday, while Newcastle Theatre Royal has been forced to call off its pantomime, Snow White and the Seven Dwarves, on Monday and Tuesday. Performances of Wicked have been scrapped between Saturday and Tuesday On Monday, the government was considering further restrictions, which could potentially include closing indoor entertainment venues again. ""It's a terrible blow if we have to shut again,"" said Sir Cameron, who has eight productions in the West End, including Hamilton, Les Miserables and Mamma Mia! ""Whether we're shut by the government or shut by stealth because of all the mixed messages we've been getting - whatever happens, the government does need to step in and help the hospitality and the commercial theatres that help keep London going."" What are the new Covid rules across the UK? Gig tickets, Christmas and Covid: Can I get a refund? Where will I need to use a Covid passport? Some theatres have already decided to clear their schedules until after Christmas or New Year to allow infected cast and crew members to recover and isolate. West End musicals The Book of Mormon, Dear Evan Hansen and Come From Away are all suspended until 27 December, with The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time off until 29 December. Shakespeare's Globe's Measure For Measure will not return until 4 January, and the curtain will stay down on the National Theatre's festive show Hex 5 until January. Last week, arts union Equity called on Chancellor Rishi Sunak to take action to protect workers in the creative industries. ""This worrying situation threatens the fragile return of live performance in theatres, pubs, clubs and other venues across a critical Christmas season,""general secretary Paul Fleming wrote,external. Stephanie Sirr, chief executive of the Nottingham Playhouse and president of UK Theatre, told BBC Breakfast: ""Christmas for all theatres is the time when they make most of their money. ""It's when you can guarantee you're going to have a certain level of income, and a lot of theatres are charities. So yes it is concerning when your main earning period is under threat."" A spokesperson for the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport said: ""Our unprecedented Â£2bn Culture Recovery Fund has given out Â£1.5bn in grants and loans, and almost Â£200m to the devolved administrations. The Â£300m third round of the Culture Recovery Fund is still open for applications, providing vital ongoing support for the cultural, heritage and creative sectors. ""We will keep the delivery of the programme under active review and consider how best to adapt it in line with the needs of the sector."" Shows currently unaffected in the West End include Harry Potter and the Cursed Child, Back to the Future, Frozen, 2.22 A Ghost Story, Pretty Woman, The Shark Is Broken and The Drifters Girl.

"Fraudsters are directing people on Facebook to sites claiming to sell fake Covid vaccine passes for those who have not been jabbed, the BBC has found. People in the UK are required to prove their vaccination status in order to access some places and to avoid self-isolation after travelling abroad. But posts on the social media site are offering unvaccinated people false certification to get around the rules. Facebook said it would remove the content ""whenever we find it"". NHS Covid passes were introduced in England in some settings, as part of the UK government's Plan B measures in the wake of the Omicron coronavirus variant spreading rapidly. To receive a pass the recipient must prove that they have been vaccinated with two doses of an approved vaccine, have completed a negative PCR test or negative rapid lateral flow test within the past 48 hours or are exempt from vaccination or vaccination and testing on the basis of a medical exemption or clinical trial participation. ""We were finding passes, certificates, cards, vaccine cards, even down to choice of what vaccine you wanted recording on the card,"" said Jonathan Benton, who runs cyber investigation firm Intelligent Sanctuary. Where will I need to use a Covid passport? Can the US crack down on fake vaccination cards? Mr Benton, a former senior detective, said a range of passes were available for sale, ranging from some which are legitimate cards but fraudulently filled in, to complete forgeries. Covid certificates have been found for sale alongside drugs, weapons and stolen goods on the dark web, with sellers claiming to provide documentation from many countries, including the US and the EU. A government spokesperson said: ""Fraud is a crime and falsifying evidence of Covid-19 status could not only put lives at risk but lead to a Â£10,000 fine. ""The NHS Covid Pass is a safe, secure and free way for individuals to share their Covid-19 vaccination record - it includes rigorous security features to minimise the risk of fraud and help organisations authenticate the Covid Pass presented to them. ""We continue to work closely with law enforcement and partners to tackle online scams, including Covid-19 related fraud."" In one post, one seller claimed to be able to provide certificates from 22 countries including Portugal, France, Greece, Spain, Australia, Latvia, Morocco and the UK. They were not only offering paper certificates, but purported to be able to provide national health authority Covid apps with QR codes, because they said they worked with people inside health authorities, who would able to add information to the database. ""Sadly, I would say [that claim] is probably highly credible,"" said Mr Benton, who also previously worked for the National Crime Agency (NCA). Mr Benton said it was difficult to know who is behind such sales, but he and his team believed organised crime groups were involved, with more criminals moving to online spaces. ""If I'm committing organised, violent crime out there on the street, and there's a risk of me getting caught and then going to prison for 10 years, versus being behind the screen of a laptop having a number of people committing fraud, I'm going to naturally migrate to that place,"" he said. Meanwhile, on Facebook, the BBC found several examples of posts or comments claiming to be selling Covid vaccination certificates for people who had not been jabbed. The posts advertised that passes would help people keep their jobs, attend events or travel more easily. And while some posts were taken down within a few days by Facebook, the BBC reported 10 posts and comments. The majority were taken down within 24 hours, but more posts and comments have appeared again on the same pages since then. The BBC also found several Facebook posts linked to channels on encrypted messaging app Telegram which offered to sell Covid certificates to unvaccinated people. Analysis by the BBC and cyber-security firm Checkpoint found that over a seven-month period between December 2020 and July 2021, Telegram channels offering Covid passes for unvaccinated people in multiple languages grew from below 10 to more than 1,000. Telegram channels are being used to sell fake Covid vaccination certificates to people One Telegram channel claiming to offer NHS and EU digital Covid passports has amassed more than 180,000 subscribers since 14 December. The BBC has contacted Telegram for comment. For Mr Benton, the task of catching fraudsters is a difficult one, and counterfeiting is ""impossible"" to stop. ""If you look at the sites that we are looking at, where you've got passes or QR passes for sale. On those same websites they are selling illegal drugs, firearms, a number of illicit materials,"" he said. ""Frankly law enforcement are struggling to keep on top of it and understand who is behind selling these goods. I can't see how they can possibly police it."" The problem of forged Covid passes is not new or unique to the UK, with fraudsters alsoadvertising fake Covid certificates in the US. For $100 (Â£70), one vendor said they could deliver a ""registered"" card, with either the logo of the US Centers for Diseases Control and Prevention (CDC) or the NHS. It is difficult to know how many fake passes are in circulation, but according to one Border Force union, some have been used to try to get into the UK. Lucy Moreton of the Immigration Services Union said fake passes had been available ever since official vaccination documentation was introduced. ""When border force were checking, we were seeing a significant minority. We would get a number of them every single day and we've no reason to believe that's changed,"" she added. The Immigration Services Union says border immigration queues would be unmanageable if extensive checks into the validity of Covid passports were to be introduced Earlier this year, Border Force was directed to stop checking people's Covid documentation and airlines have been doing so instead. ""Because Border Force no longer check routinely, we don't know how prevalent these are and how much this is actually being used and being missed by the airlines who are understandably not forgery experts,"" said Ms Moreton. She said spotting fakes was ""no different from spotting an email scam"", but added there was ""no model"" for extensive checks and that border queues would ""become really unmanageable"". But, she says, returning to paperwork checks would cause other problems. ""There's no model for running the UK border extends to controlling British citizen in a process that takes 10-12 minutes If we were to check from every individual, rapidly the queues would become really unmanageable."" The Labour Party said the UK needed ""much stronger action"" against this type of online crime and called on the Home Office to ""urgently make sure the border Covid system isn't full of gaps because of fake documents"". A statement from Meta, which owns Facebook, said it prohibited anyone from buying, selling, or trading fake, or even genuine, medical documents on its platforms. ""We'll continue to identify and remove this content whenever we find it, and will disable accounts, pages or groups that repeatedly break our rules,"" the company added.

"This video can not be played Jason Leitch says there are things we can do to ""make the peak smaller, perhaps even delay it"" Scotland is ""nowhere near"" the peak of the Omicron wave, with cases likely to double or treble in coming days, the national clinical director has said. Jason Leitch told BBC Scotland that models suggested a late January or early February peak and a sharp rise in deaths and hospital admissions. But Prof Leitch said Scotland was not ""powerless"" and could fight to reduce or delay the peak. A return to stricter lockdown measure was also not ""inevitable"", he added. Omicron is much more infectious than previous Covid strains and now accounts for nearly 60% of all Scottish infections,according to Scottish government figures,external. Total daily cases have been rising since the end of November, when Omicron was first detected in Scotland. More than 6,700 new cases were confirmed on Monday and Public Health Scotland said many results had been delayed because of the ""larger volumes"" of tests being processed by labs. The percentage of positive tests also reached 15.2% - the highest it has been since January. Speaking onBBC Radio Scotland's Lunchtime Live programme, Prof Leitch said: ""Positive cases were rising over the weekend. We approached over 5,000 - I'm expecting that to go up again today and for the rest of this week. ""I'm afraid we're not in the foothills any more of this Omicron wave, we're in it."" In leaked minutes seen by the BBC last week, the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies suggested that if no further restrictions were introduced, UK hospital admissions could peak at between 3,000 and 10,000 a day - and deaths between 600 and 6,000. Prof Leitch said this could translate to between 60 and 600 Covid deaths a day in Scotland, but added there was not yet enough data on Omicron to know for sure. He told BBC Scotland that hospital admissions for Covid would begin to rise soon, reflecting the recent increase in cases. ""We are very hopeful that Omicron might not be as severe, so you might not get as many hospitalisations per 100 people,"" he said. ""But the fact you're going to get double, treble the number of cases means it's not long before our hospitals really struggle - and our hospitals are already finding it very challenging because of winter, postponed care, other diseases and some Covid."" More than 10,000 new Omicron cases found in UK Why more Omicron restrictions may cause harm Covid in Scotland: Where are the latest cases? Prof Leitch said it was not inevitable that hospitals would be overwhelmed, but warned of ""difficult choices"" around patient care as they became ""very, very busy"". ""The modelling suggests the peak of this wave is a little bit unpredictable, but probably into late January, early February, so that gives you some idea of where we're headed,"" he said. ""But we're not powerless. There are things we can do to make that peak smaller and perhaps even delay it to give us more time, because the more we delay, the more we vaccinate."" He said it was key that people reduced their socialising as much as they could and maintained social distancing with people outside their household. A speedy booster programme is considered vital in tackling the threat of Omicron as the third dose appears to offer much more protection against the strain. The Scottish government has saidit wants to give the booster to 80% of all eligible adultsby the end of the year, and the number of daily vaccinations has gone up to more than 60,000 a day since the end of last week. But the sharp rise in cases has led to hints thattougher Covid restrictions could be introducedaround the new year. Prof Leitch told BBC Scotland that Omicron needed a ""fast and hard"" response, but said a full lockdown was not ""inevitable"". ""I don't think we'll go back to what we knew as lockdown right at the beginning, [because of] the other harms - economic, educational, the mental health harms,"" he said. ""I think the politicians around the world will have to consider other protections, but that will depend on the state of the pandemic and their environment - Scotland included - but also dependent on what you can do financially.""

"Sir Richard Sutton's wealth was valued at Â£301m in the 2020 Sunday Times Rich List A man who killed one of the UK's richest men and paralysed his own mother in a ""ferocious"" knife attack has been given a life sentence. Thomas Schreiber fatally stabbed 83-year-old Sir Richard Sutton at his home near Gillingham, Dorset, in April. The 35-year-old also attacked his mother Anne Schreiber, who was Sir Richard's partner. He was convicted of murder and attempted murder. He was jailed for a minimum of 36 years at Winchester Crown Court. Armed police were called to Moorhill, Sir Richard's home in Higher Langham that he shared with both Anne and Thomas Schreiber, at 19:30 BST on 7 April. Ms Schreiber was ""barely conscious"" when she was discovered in the kitchen, before being carried out by police officers to waiting paramedics. Sir Richard was found dead outside his upstairs bedroom. He had suffered multiple stab wounds.

"Sir Richard Sutton's wealth was valued at Â£301m in the 2020 Sunday Times Rich List A man who killed one of the UK's richest men and paralysed his own mother in a ""ferocious"" knife attack has been given a life sentence. Thomas Schreiber fatally stabbed 83-year-old Sir Richard Sutton at his home near Gillingham, Dorset, in April. The 35-year-old also attacked his mother Anne Schreiber, who was Sir Richard's partner. He was convicted of murder and attempted murder. He was jailed for a minimum of 36 years at Winchester Crown Court. Armed police were called to Moorhill, Sir Richard's home in Higher Langham that he shared with both Anne and Thomas Schreiber, at 19:30 BST on 7 April. Ms Schreiber was ""barely conscious"" when she was discovered in the kitchen, before being carried out by police officers to waiting paramedics. Sir Richard was found dead outside his upstairs bedroom. He had suffered multiple stab wounds.

"The chancellor needs to ""get his act together"" and provide support for struggling hospitality businesses, the boss of two restaurant chains has said. David Page, chairman of the firm which runs the Real Greek and Franco Manca, said Rishi Sunak needed to provide financial help ""in the next 24 hours"". It comes as 100,000 retail, hospitality and leisure businesses called on government for more support. The government is yet to offer further measures for struggling businesses. Mr Page said the country was in ""lockdown by stealth"" due to government advice to limit social contacts. ""The chancellor better get his act together otherwise it's going to be a really horrible Christmas for our sector,"" said Mr Page, chairman of Fulham Shore. ""If you want a choice of restaurants the chancellor, needs to do something very, very quickly. ""I'm not sure any of the cabinet understand cash flow and cash flow is the problem at the moment, over the last week or two and over the next 10 days."" UK shoppers avoid High Streets amid Omicron fears Business alarm at prospect of more Covid measures Restaurants and pubs have been dealing with large numbers of cancellations in the run-up to Christmas as fears have risen over the spread of Omicron. The hospitality industry has estimated takings in December will be down by 40% - with the damage up to twice that in London. A letter to the chancellor, penned by 100,000 businesses, argued existing support from the government was ""insufficient"". Matthew Sims, head of Croydon Business Improvement District, said it was ""alarming"" that Mr Sunak was ""doggedly sticking to measures which are out of date and out of touch with the stark and desperate reality retail, hospitality and leisure businesses are facing"". Mr Page said that while city centre branches of Franco Manca and Real Greek restaurants were experiencing a dip in sales, trade in commuter areas across England was up. ""We have got a geographical spread, that helps us. If you're exposed to central London and you've only got one or two sites, you're in trouble at the moment,"" he said. Nick Mackenzie, boss of pub chain Greene King, said bookings had been ""decimated"" across the business amid the rapid spread of the Omicron coronavirus variant. He agreed with Mr Page that the country was in lockdown ""in all but name"", due to government messaging. He called on the government for ""urgent"" help, with others saying firms needed support ""in the next 24 hours"". Greene King, which manages 1,700 pubs and rents out 1,000, faced an ""incredibly difficult"" situation during what would usually be its busiest trading period of the year, Mr Mackenzie said. ""Demand has dropped, bookings have been decimated, in some parts of the country we are 70-80% down on 2019,"" he said. Mr Mackenzie said the government ""should be commended"" for the measures it brought in to help hospitality businesses earlier in the pandemic, but added that the situation was ""urgent again now"". ""We need them to move towards things like furlough support for [pubs] that we are having to close or those severely impacted, business rates relief, and removal of the cap on business rates."" The government has not ruled out bringing in further Covid restrictions before Christmas, with Health Secretary Sajid Javid telling the BBC's Andrew Marr Show there were ""no guarantees"" in a pandemic. Greene King said if it had to close sites due to government restrictions, the shut down and then reopening costs to the business would be about Â£5,000 per pub. The UK's food and drink wholesalers, which supply schools, care homes and hospitals as well as pubs and restaurants, have warned they face losing millions of pounds if a new lockdown is announced, with millions of tonnes of food currently in warehouses going to waste. The Federation of Wholesale Distributors (FWD) said businesses could ""no longer absorb the losses caused by last-minute closure of their customers"". Chancellor Mr Sunak met with representatives from the hospitality sector last Thursday to discuss their concerns, after Prime Minister Boris Johnson advised people to ""think carefully before you go"" out to socialise. The UK's chief medical officer Prof Chris Whitty also urged people not to ""mix with people you don't have to"". A Treasury spokesperson said: ""The chancellor has spoken to a range of business and industry leaders in recent days. ""We recognise how important the festive period is for so many businesses and the government will continue to engage constructively on how it can best provide ongoing support to the businesses and sectors affected.""

"Fans have had to use a Covid-19 pass in order to attend fixtures in recent weeks Premier League and EFL clubs have chosen to fulfil festive fixtures despite ongoing Covid-19 disruption. The decision comes despite Premier League players and club staff returning a record 90 positive tests last week. The Premier League's 20 clubs met on Monday to discuss the fixture list after six weekend games were postponed. No vote took place and so two rounds of fixtures are in place across five days from 26 December, while the EFL will play games ""where it is safe to do so"". It had been expected that the Premier League's gameweek 20, starting on 28 December, would be postponed in order to ease the pressure on Premier League squads. BBC Sport understands one discussion point at the meeting was for each club to play two fixtures over the festive period across three gameweeks, meaning no individual gameweek would have been fully postponed. Instead, clubs have been advised if they have 13 fit players, plus a goalkeeper, they should fulfil their games. FA Cup replays in rounds three and four have however been scrappedand talks are ongoing on whether to reduce EFL Cup semi-final ties to one-leg matches. Shortly after the meeting, the Premier League confirmed there had been 90 new positive cases from 12,345 tests on players and staff between 13 and 19 December. The figure was more than double last week's 42 cases, which was a record since the pandemic began. Jude Bellingham 'would advise' footballers to get vaccinated against Covid On Monday, Premier League figures showed 77% of players have had two vaccination jabs, a rise from 68% in October. In all, 84% of players have had at least one vaccination. If staff are included in the analysis the figure rises to 92%. There were 44 positive tests in the Women's Super League and Championship last week - the highest figure since the leagues began releasing test data. The Premier League said Monday's meeting saw ""a range of issues discussed"" including adapting the Covid-19 postponement process. Saturday's fixture between Aston Villa and Burnley wascalled off at two hours' notice. In Sunday's Premier League fixtures, Chelsea named just six substitutes for their draw at Wolves and Liverpool drew at Tottenham without a number of first-team names. Five of Saturday's six fixtures were called off. Chelsea tried to get Sunday's fixture at Wolves postponed and boss Thomas Tuchel said his players were put at ""huge risk... not just because of Covid but also physically"". It is understood Liverpool were among a group of clubs who pushed for the postponement of gameweek 20. After Sunday's draw at Spurs, Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp said playing on 26 and 28 December was not feasible. ""It's impossible, we don't have the players,"" Klopp said. ""We have to think we will get an extra case or two. We cannot just push it all through. The 26th and 28th, that's not possible. We would prefer to play but we need help with the fixtures."" The seven Premier League teams still in the Carabao Cup face ties on 21 and 22 December and will play three Premier League fixtures between then and 2 January. Wolves club tweeted a photo of captain Conor Coady and head coach Bruno Lage having their booster jabs. Lage added on Monday: ""Everyone in our building is fully vaccinated, which is the right thing to do, especially with the increase in positive cases in the Premier League and wider society.""

Two Championship matches and five League Two games on 26 December havealready been called offbecause of positive Covid-19 cases. The EFL said it anticipates further postponements but sees ""optimism that disruption can be minimised"". EFL chief executive Trevor Birch said: ""We will continue to work with clubs, authorities and other agencies to monitor the Covid-19 case rate and be prepared to respond accordingly, yet for now the view remains that we can continue to deliver games safely where clubs have sufficient healthy personnel in place, on and off the pitch. ""With club mitigation measures, the mass adoption of booster jabs and Covid certification now required for larger crowds, we are sure many fans will continue to feel confident in attending matches over the Christmas period and we look forward to welcoming them."" BBC Sport football reporter Simon Stone: There was discussion about a two-week circuit break at Monday's Premier League shareholders' meeting but there was not enough support for it to come close to being implemented. In the end, uncertainty over what lies ahead won the day - and some realities were reinforced. Chelsea boss Thomas Tuchel wanted Sunday's game at Wolves to be called off. The request was turned down. It was noted his squad contained two outfield substitutes who cost Â£55m - and in Saul Niguez's case an option to buy for Â£30m. They also have, by any criteria, one of the best academies in world football. The feeling within the game is that Tuchel - and managerial colleagues in the same situation - should get on with it and use the talent at their disposal and that having the ""best"" squad is different to having ""a"" squad. Clubs do not know what the future holds. Rumours abound about lockdown restrictions returning, which would slash attendances and income from the turnstiles. Knowing that is a possibility, the clubs are reluctant to agree to a pause that they might not need. Ten Premier League games already need to be rescheduled in a calendar that had no room for them until the FA removed the week allocated for third round replays in January. There has been discussion about whether the EFL Cup semi-finals next month should revert to one game rather than the usual two. Any decision around that will be impacted by whether this week's quarter-finals go ahead - and what the overall situation in the country is like. As always debate around the players is intense. Urged to return to the field during the first stages of the pandemic, now conversation is about whether they should stop. The Professional Footballers' Association, like the clubs, continues to urge members to get vaccinated while trying to ensure players are not used as pawns in a wider PR game.

"Pret A Manger has received thousands of complaints over its drinks subscription service following frustration that not all promised beverages are available. The Â£20 a month deal offers unlimited hot and cold drinks. But the BBC understands the High Street chain has received 5,000 complaints about the offer, such as smoothies often being unavailable. Ex-Pret staff have also told the BBC its introduction has meant workers feel overwhelmed by the increased workload. Pret a Manger launched the subscription in September 2020 after sales plunged during Covid lockdowns. The company said it was ""really pleased"" with the response to the subscription offer where it pledges: ""If our Baristas brew it, blend it or steam it, you can have it!"" ""While it's been incredibly popular, we're constantly working with our teams and customers to make it better, so that we're able to continue to deliver the outstanding service our people are known for,"" the company said. But some customers said that this is not always the case. Rachel, from Watford, who had been on furlough for months, recently started commuting again. ""As I was now travelling into London again I thought I'd treat myself to drinks I wouldn't usually try,"" she told the BBC. ""But most of the time I'm told that I can't have a cold drink because they're unavailable."" Another customer, Brendan, also subscribed, limiting himself to two drinks a day ""to stay healthy"". But he told the BBC that by mid-afternoon mango and pineapple preference is often not available. ""It's become a long standing joke with the staff now,"" he said. ""I laughed it off for a while, but now I'm getting angry and I'm starting to feel I've been ripped off`."" Pret to hire 3,000 staff as city workers return Pret a Manger makes staff pay cuts permanent Meanwhile another customer, Isabelle, tweeted: ""Have been to four Prets this morning that have 'stopped doing smoothies'. Is this because of the subscription? The smoothies were a key part of me wanting to sign up."" Other customers have taken their complaints to the UK's Advertising Standards Authority (ASA). The regulator has contacted Pret a Manger to say that they should ""consider reviewing the ads for their subscription service"". The ASA said it informed  Pret ""that their ads should not state or imply that the service was available in all store locations, or that it covers their entire range of products if that wasn't the case"". Pret said: ""We have spoken with the ASA to ensure all Pret marketing for the coffee subscription is in accordance with their latest guidance."" Meanwhile, some former Pret employees said working conditions became ""unbearable"" after the subscription was launched. One claimed that staff deliberately turned blending machines off as it takes one-and-a-half minutes to prepare a smoothie. If a ""mystery shopper"" is in store they'll be marked down - with the team missing out on financial bonuses - if they don't deliver drinks within a strict time frame. He also alleges that other colleagues pretend the machines are broken, are being washed or there's a supply issue and they've run out of the small blue bags which contain a carefully portioned amount of fruit. ""Staff are just frustrated and tired with the endless smoothie and frappes giveaway, and they just boycott it, "" he said. ""It is just easy to say that ice or smoothies or frappe are gone for today. ""They are really time consuming. Try to make 50 smoothies daily one by one and you will feel it."" A Pret barista who recently quit revealed that he had worked for his store in the Thames Valley since it opened three years ago: ""But the whole demeanour changed when they brought in the subscription. The blending machines can't take it. ""I can understand why Pret think it makes commercial sense but the staff can't take much more."" Another Pret worker was so disgruntled with the conditions that she set up a website to gather complaints. The site, expret.org, is kept up to date with the latest frustrations, as she felt no one was listening to her or her colleagues. Pret claims that less than 1% of the complaints about their subscription are about the lack of smoothies or frappes. A spokesman added that when Pret suggested frappes and smoothies would be removed from the subscription earlier in 2021: ""There was a public outcry so Pret listened and kept them as part of the subscription."" In the same month Pret launched the deal, rival Leon offered a similar promotion for Â£15 a month - but it was limited to 75 coffees a month and excluded other drinks such as teas and hot chocolate. Leon has since suspended it, stating: ""To help our teams during these difficult times, we have stopped taking on new subscribers.""

"This video can not be played Jason Leitch says there are things we can do to ""make the peak smaller, perhaps even delay it"" Scotland is ""nowhere near"" the peak of the Omicron wave, with cases likely to double or treble in coming days, the national clinical director has said. Jason Leitch told BBC Scotland that models suggested a late January or early February peak and a sharp rise in deaths and hospital admissions. But Prof Leitch said Scotland was not ""powerless"" and could fight to reduce or delay the peak. A return to stricter lockdown measure was also not ""inevitable"", he added. Omicron is much more infectious than previous Covid strains and now accounts for nearly 60% of all Scottish infections,according to Scottish government figures,external. Total daily cases have been rising since the end of November, when Omicron was first detected in Scotland. More than 6,700 new cases were confirmed on Monday and Public Health Scotland said many results had been delayed because of the ""larger volumes"" of tests being processed by labs. The percentage of positive tests also reached 15.2% - the highest it has been since January. Speaking onBBC Radio Scotland's Lunchtime Live programme, Prof Leitch said: ""Positive cases were rising over the weekend. We approached over 5,000 - I'm expecting that to go up again today and for the rest of this week. ""I'm afraid we're not in the foothills any more of this Omicron wave, we're in it."" In leaked minutes seen by the BBC last week, the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies suggested that if no further restrictions were introduced, UK hospital admissions could peak at between 3,000 and 10,000 a day - and deaths between 600 and 6,000. Prof Leitch said this could translate to between 60 and 600 Covid deaths a day in Scotland, but added there was not yet enough data on Omicron to know for sure. He told BBC Scotland that hospital admissions for Covid would begin to rise soon, reflecting the recent increase in cases. ""We are very hopeful that Omicron might not be as severe, so you might not get as many hospitalisations per 100 people,"" he said. ""But the fact you're going to get double, treble the number of cases means it's not long before our hospitals really struggle - and our hospitals are already finding it very challenging because of winter, postponed care, other diseases and some Covid."" More than 10,000 new Omicron cases found in UK Why more Omicron restrictions may cause harm Covid in Scotland: Where are the latest cases? Prof Leitch said it was not inevitable that hospitals would be overwhelmed, but warned of ""difficult choices"" around patient care as they became ""very, very busy"". ""The modelling suggests the peak of this wave is a little bit unpredictable, but probably into late January, early February, so that gives you some idea of where we're headed,"" he said. ""But we're not powerless. There are things we can do to make that peak smaller and perhaps even delay it to give us more time, because the more we delay, the more we vaccinate."" He said it was key that people reduced their socialising as much as they could and maintained social distancing with people outside their household. A speedy booster programme is considered vital in tackling the threat of Omicron as the third dose appears to offer much more protection against the strain. The Scottish government has saidit wants to give the booster to 80% of all eligible adultsby the end of the year, and the number of daily vaccinations has gone up to more than 60,000 a day since the end of last week. But the sharp rise in cases has led to hints thattougher Covid restrictions could be introducedaround the new year. Prof Leitch told BBC Scotland that Omicron needed a ""fast and hard"" response, but said a full lockdown was not ""inevitable"". ""I don't think we'll go back to what we knew as lockdown right at the beginning, [because of] the other harms - economic, educational, the mental health harms,"" he said. ""I think the politicians around the world will have to consider other protections, but that will depend on the state of the pandemic and their environment - Scotland included - but also dependent on what you can do financially.""

"This video can not be played Jason Leitch says there are things we can do to ""make the peak smaller, perhaps even delay it"" Scotland is ""nowhere near"" the peak of the Omicron wave, with cases likely to double or treble in coming days, the national clinical director has said. Jason Leitch told BBC Scotland that models suggested a late January or early February peak and a sharp rise in deaths and hospital admissions. But Prof Leitch said Scotland was not ""powerless"" and could fight to reduce or delay the peak. A return to stricter lockdown measure was also not ""inevitable"", he added. Omicron is much more infectious than previous Covid strains and now accounts for nearly 60% of all Scottish infections,according to Scottish government figures,external. Total daily cases have been rising since the end of November, when Omicron was first detected in Scotland. More than 6,700 new cases were confirmed on Monday and Public Health Scotland said many results had been delayed because of the ""larger volumes"" of tests being processed by labs. The percentage of positive tests also reached 15.2% - the highest it has been since January. Speaking onBBC Radio Scotland's Lunchtime Live programme, Prof Leitch said: ""Positive cases were rising over the weekend. We approached over 5,000 - I'm expecting that to go up again today and for the rest of this week. ""I'm afraid we're not in the foothills any more of this Omicron wave, we're in it."" In leaked minutes seen by the BBC last week, the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies suggested that if no further restrictions were introduced, UK hospital admissions could peak at between 3,000 and 10,000 a day - and deaths between 600 and 6,000. Prof Leitch said this could translate to between 60 and 600 Covid deaths a day in Scotland, but added there was not yet enough data on Omicron to know for sure. He told BBC Scotland that hospital admissions for Covid would begin to rise soon, reflecting the recent increase in cases. ""We are very hopeful that Omicron might not be as severe, so you might not get as many hospitalisations per 100 people,"" he said. ""But the fact you're going to get double, treble the number of cases means it's not long before our hospitals really struggle - and our hospitals are already finding it very challenging because of winter, postponed care, other diseases and some Covid.""

"Treasury money will be used to help businesses and the overall Covid effort Scotland is to receive Â£220m of emergency UK government money to help tackle Covid-19. Chancellor Rishi Sunak says the sum represents a doubling of additional funding being made available. The Scottish government has made repeated calls for more funds from the Treasury as Omicron numbers rise. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon welcomed the announcement but said it appeared to be an advance on money that would have come to Scotland anyway. She told BBC Scotland: ""We think last night's [funding announcement] has delivered us some extra spending powers now, although it might have to be repaid at a later date. ""So, we are working through all of the detail of that and we will consider that in the course of the other decisions that we think about at cabinet tomorrow."" Calls for hospitality support after 'bleak Friday' Sunak to hold Omicron crisis talks with businesses Music venues warn they will close without bailout Ms Sturgeon has been pressing the Treasury for more financial support as the Covid cases continue to rise again, suggesting that she may go further with restrictions if it were possible to cushion the blow to businesses. The UK government said the emergency funding was on top of the Â£220m announced earlier in the week, taking Scotland's total allocation to Â£440m. Money has also been allocated to other devolved administrations, with the Welsh  government receiving an extra Â£270m and the Northern Ireland Executive Â£150m. Chancellor Rishi Sunak said: ""Following discussions with the devolved administrations, we are now doubling the additional funding available. ""We will continue to listen to and work with the devolved administrations in the face of this serious health crisis, to ensure we're getting the booster to people all over the UK and that people in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland are supported."" This cash advance from the Treasury should allow the Scottish government to expand their Covid support scheme for struggling businesses, including bars and restaurants. They have found Â£100m from within their own budget but acknowledge that much more will be required to compensate for the economic disruption caused by official advice to the public to cut social contact. The initial Â£220m from the Treasury is not really available for that. It is an advance of Scotland's share of cash generated by new health spending in England and will be spent on health in Scotland too. The further Â£220m is also an advance of money that will become due to Scotland as a result of extra spending in England. But this time it is based on spending that has not yet been allocated. The Treasury is under pressure to come up with a support package for hospitality in England. It may be that the Scottish and other devolved governments have just received a down payment on that. If the cash comes from spending in some other area, like health, and the Scottish government has already spent it on helping business, they cannot then replicate the health spending. In the unlikely event there is no additional spending in England, the Scottish government would have to pay the money back. Ms Sturgeon insisted that Scotland did not have ""as much financial clout as I would like us to have"". She went on: ""And it isn't just about getting amounts of money announced randomly from time-to-time. ""It's also having clarity about - not just for Scotland, but for Wales and for Northern Ireland - how, if we are taking decisions that we think are necessary to protect public health, what is the process by which we can trigger financial support the way the UK government can for England when they take these decisions."" Kate Forbes delivered the Scottish budget earlier this month Finance Secretary Kate Forbes has asked for about Â£500m of immediate extra funding from Westminster, a figure based on the monthly costs of furlough and grants. She said: ""Ultimately this is about helping businesses right now that are struggling, but also knowing that when we need more support - because none of us can absolutely for definite know how this variant is going to play out - we know that we can access additional support for businesses."" Murdo Fraser, the Scottish Conservatives' spokesman for Covid Recovery, insisted the funding was ""real, additional money that has not been previously identified or accounted for"". He told the BBC'sGood Morning Scotlandprogramme: ""This is not an advance. It's very disappointing that rather than welcome this essential money that's coming from the UK government, we just hear the SNP attempt to stir up more grievance. ""It is money that will be available to the Scottish government to assist the many businesses and individuals who are really suffering because of the impact that guidance issued by the Scottish government has had."" Ms Sturgeon warned on Friday that Omicron was now the dominant strain of the virus and a ""tsunami"" was beginning to hit Scotland. New guidance for shops, hospitality venues and other businesses wasintroduced on Friday, in a bid to stem the transmission of Covid. RULES:What are the restrictions in your area?

"The group of refugees were to be split and settled in a location in Northern Ireland and in Monaghan in the Republic of Ireland A government scheme to resettle refugees from the Democratic Republic of Congo to Northern Ireland was cancelled after what the Home Office described as ""racist events"" in Belfast. BBC News NI understands the Home Office had concerns after racist attacks on the Roma community in 2009. The Congolese refugees were eventually resettled in Rochdale in England. More than 800 Afghan refugees are due to arrive in Northern Ireland in 2022. The UK Border Agency was involved in a project to bring 120 Congolese refugees from a camp in Tanzania to the UK and Ireland. The group were to be split between Monaghan in the Republic of Ireland and a location in Northern Ireland. The international programme was operating under the supervision of the United Nations. The scheme aimed to ""resettle the most vulnerable refugees currently living in refugee camps or urban areas whose life, liberty, safety, health or other fundamental human rights are at risk in the country of refuge"". Until now, little has been known about the schemebut an evaluation of the project carried out at the time,externalsaid ""in the event, difficulties were encountered working against a tight timetable to prepare the ground (politically, practically and socially) for the arrival and resettlement of the refugees in Northern Ireland, an area with little experience of managing the resettlement of refugees"". A freedom of information request led to more detail being provided. The response stated: ""Due to issues around timing and preparedness of Northern Ireland host communities, and taking into consideration the unfortunate impact of the negative media coverage following racist events in Northern Ireland in 2009, the decision was taken in July of that year, not to resettle refugees to Northern Ireland at that time."" Country profile: DR Congo The decision to delay the scheme meant some of those due to travel to Northern Ireland had to remain at the refugee camp for an extra year. In 2009, Northern Irelandmade headlines across the world,externalafter a number of racist attacks on Roma families. Nearly 2,000 Syrian refugees have been resettled in Northern Ireland since 2016 About 100 members of the Roma community left their homes and had to seek refuge in church halls and leisure centres beforethe Northern Ireland Executive arranged transport for them back to Romania,external. Baroness Margaret Ritchie met some of those affected at the time in her role as Stormont's social development minister, with responsibility for housing. She said the Roma people had to be relocated to Belfast's Olympia Leisure Centre ""for their own safety"". The baroness said she remembered the families carrying their belonging in plastic bags. ""My heart went out to these people and I felt that we had to do something in terms of social justice to help them."" The families were given temporary accommodation in former student halls of residence in Belfast, before the Romanian ambassador travelled over from London to organise their repatriation. ""He undertook to ensure that they were relocated back to their own homes in north-east Romania and we paid for that transportation by bus and by plane,"" Ms Ritchie said. BBC News NI's Good Morning Ulster programme understands that it was in the aftermath of those events that the decision was taken not to bring the refugees from DR Congo to Northern Ireland. Since 2009, things have changed and almost2,000 Syrian refugees have been resettled in Northern Ireland since 2016through a UK government scheme. The Stormont executive has also committed to resettle about 800 refugees from Afghanistan in 2022. When contacted by BBC News NI, neither the Home Office nor the Northern Ireland Executive answered our questions about the reasons for cancelling the scheme. The Stormont Executive Office said: ""The situation in respect of refugees and asylum seekers has changed considerably over the past number of years. Two new schools to welcome refugee children NI resettles highest proportion of Syrian refugees Fleeing the Syrian war for Belfast ""We have a relatively small but increasing minority ethnic population, which is bringing welcome diversity to our local communities. ""While we believe this is a welcoming place, we recognise that unfortunately there will be a small number of individuals in society who still demonstrate prejudice and bias. ""Through initiatives such as the racial equality strategy and the draft Refugee Integration Strategy, which is currently out for public consultation, we are committed to making this a place built on equality and respect where everyone can live fulfilled lives and realise their full potential."" The Home Office said the UK government had ""a proud history of supporting refugees through safe and legal routes"". ""We are grateful to Northern Ireland for their efforts in the UK's resettlement schemes and for their participation in supporting asylum seekers,"" it added. The Lord Mayor of Belfast of Kate Nicholl said she believed the people of Northern Ireland are more welcoming to refugees but there were ""serious issues"" with government policies. ""Things are really sensitive right now. We know that the public are generally more accepting but the services are really stretched,"" Ms Nicholl told Good Morning Ulster. ""We're seeing a much bigger jump now in the number of asylum seekers coming here and the services are struggling to respond."" The lord mayor added: ""If you look at how successful Syrian integration was, that was largely as a result of community doing great work, and I think that there's a lot that needs to be done."" The current South Belfast MP Claire Hanna said it was ""upsetting"" to learn that the Congolese resettlement did not go ahead but she said she believed Northern Ireland had changed a lot in the last 12 years and become a more diverse place. ""While there's always been, unfortunately here, a minority of people who are unable to accept difference, the vast majority of people understand that things like conflict and climate change are driving the movement of people and that some of them have to be able to find refuge and build new lives here. ""Many, many people want to be able to help them do that and we just need to have the governance support to allow that to happen in a managed and organised and constructive way,"" the MP added. Refugee support worker Suleiman Abdulahi said be believed that a lack of government support was the ""real reason"" that more people do not seek refuge in Northern Ireland, rather than racism. Mr Abdulahi fled his homeland of Somali in 1991 and later moved to Northern Ireland, where he founded the support group Horn of Africa People's Aid Northern Ireland (HAPANI). ""I think it's a lack of capacity, a lack of strategy, and that is the real cause of [why] people will not come to Northern Ireland,"" he told Good Morning Ulster. ""It could not be blamed on the public... Northern Ireland is a place of welcoming and sanctuary for people who come in and I have no doubt speaking from working over the last 10 years, that the support we get from the public is much greater than the support we get from the government.""

"NHS spending in Wales will jump next year to tackle record high waiting times created by Covid. An extra Â£893m will be pumped in during 2022, as part of the Â£24.6bn Welsh government budget. More cash has also been promised for councils, and Labour Finance Minister Rebecca Evans said the budget will help make Wales ""a fairer nation"". Welsh Conservatives said the budget had been made possible after record funding from the UK government. Shops and hospitality will get a 50% cut to business rates - a relief to some firms waiting to hear if there would be any help for the tax from April. Plaid Cymru said the spending plans will deliver a ""stronger"" Wales, following the party's co-operation agreement with Welsh Labour ministers. Welsh government cash boost as families squeezed Millions to be worse off in 2022, says think tank What's in the chancellor's Budget for Wales? The Welsh government say that over three years it will provide Â£1.3bn in extra direct funding to the Welsh NHS. Most of that - Â£893m - will arrive in the first financial year. That is a 10.7% increase on the current budget, or 7.8% when inflation is taken into account, with smaller increases in later years. Numbers waiting for treatmentshit record levelslast August. Budget documents say the government's ""highest priority is to address the backlog of treatments that have been delayed by the pandemic"". Helen Whyley of the Royal College of Nurses said a significant portion has to be spent on NHS salaries, with 1,719 vacancies in Wales. The union is currently in dispute with the Welsh government over pay. ""You can have all the money in the world for services,"" Ms Whyley said. ""But if you don't have the staff to care for patients, and to deliver that care safely, it won't buy you anything."" Despite the rise in day-to-day spending, funding for health care facilities will fall from Â£377m to Â£279m next year. Firms were worried they would face higher bills after the pandemic The Welsh NHS Confederation, which represents health organisations, said its ""members are disappointed in the lack of investment in capital infrastructure to improve and redesign NHS estates and facilities"". Cardiff University's Guto Ifan said the planned increase for NHS spending in Wales appears to be ""slightly below"" extra cash for Wales triggered because of NHS spending in England. ""There are huge uncertainties about the medium-term impact of the pandemic and these spending plans could well need to be revised upwards in later years."" Council funding will increase by Â£384m to Â£5.1bn - 8.1% in nominal terms or 5.2% when inflation is taken into account. Officials say this is the largest increase to the cash for local government - which is spent on social care and other services - since devolution began. Mr Ifan said councils should be able to meet their spending needs next year ""with relatively low increases in council tax"". The announcement follows a promise of more cash for Welsh public services from the Treasury, which provides the lion's share of the Welsh government's money. Experts at Cardiff University sayÂ£2.9bn will be available to spend by 2024. It also comes afteran agreementbetween the Welsh government and Plaid Cymru which included free school meals over three years and expanding free childcare to two-year-olds. Both were included in the budget, with Â£30m for early years and childcare, and Â£90m for free school meals over three years. The Vale Resort is starting to recover after a difficult 21 months According to the Welsh government, businesses in retail, leisure and hospitality will receive 50% rates relief for 2022-23, matching similar plans announced by Chancellor Rishi Sunak for England. It will be less than the 100% discount many such firms receive now. The scheme will be capped at Â£110,000 per business. With other relief schemes ministers say 85,000 properties will be supported, while a further Â£35m will be spent to freeze rates for 2022-23. Despite the announcement, Michael Manghan and Rhian Davies, who run the Crown and Sceptre in Cadoxton, Neath, are still concerned for what 2022 will hold. Ms Davies feared the rate bill they would now need to pay was a ""big chunk of money to find"". She said she would have like to have seen more, but added: ""It's better than nothing."" Mr Manghan said: ""The money we've lost over the last year - we're only just coming back to repay people."" Michael Manghan and Rhian Davies are concerned for the future of the business Sam Dabb, who runs Le Pub in Newport, was pleased to hear the news. ""It's one of the main costs of the business, it's absolutely massive."" One businessman said the Welsh government definitely had to meet the 50% cut introduced in England, and warned next year could be tough. The Vale Resort in Hensol, Vale of Glamorgan, is starting to recover after a difficult 21 months. Bookings have increased since Covid restrictions were lifted and the company has opened a distillery on site to expand the business. Its managing director, Stephen Leeke, said government support schemes such as furlough, business rate relief and the Economic Resilience Fund (ERF) had helped the company stay afloat. He said: ""There's certainly an argument to say that they might consider going further, because I think we are in for a bit of a roller coaster now in the next couple of months and I don't think there's any doubt the industry will need some support."" The Welsh government said it would spend Â£1.8bn on investments in its climate change department over three years, which includes Â£1.6bn on housing. Of that, Â£1bn will be spent on housing and Â£375m for building safety. Finance Minister Rebecca Evans said the Welsh government was still operating in a ""difficult financial context with our budget nearly Â£3bn lower than if it had increased in line with the economy since 2010-11"". ""This budget will support the Wales of today and shape the Wales of tomorrow. It will support our public services to be stronger, put Wales further down the path to being a net zero nation, and create a fairer nation with equality at its heart,"" she said. Welsh Conservative finance spokesman Peter Fox said: ""Today's budget has been made possible by the Conservative government delivering record funding for Wales. ""In that light, I welcome the much-needed business rates holiday to help firms recover from the ongoing challenges of the pandemic, along with an important uplift in funding for our local authorities who deliver so many key services in communities across Wales."" Llyr Gruffydd, Plaid Cymru finance spokesperson, said: ""Thanks to Plaid Cymru, this budget will deliver an even fairer, even greener, even stronger Wales through ambitious policy pledges. ""From free school meals for all primary pupils to extending free childcare to all two-year olds and much more, the commitments secured by Plaid Cymru as part of the co-operation agreement with Welsh government will secure transformational support for some of our poorest households and will change people's lives for the better across Wales."" There will be relief among the many thousands working in hospitality, retail and leisure across Wales. The Welsh government has matched what is happening in England and business rates for those industries will be halved. Most of them will still struggle to pay that as the pandemic continues to play havoc with trade with fewer people out shopping. With a new Welsh government department focused on climate change, it's hardly surprising that it's getting more money. What is interesting, and tells us about the departments priorities, is that of the Â£1.8bn for capital spending by the climate change minister almost all of it (Â£1.6bn) is to improve the quality and supply of housing. This budget is taking the long term view even though the immediate economic landscape is extremely fragile.

""But if you don't have the staff to care for patients, and to deliver that care safely, it won't buy you anything."" Despite the rise in day-to-day spending, funding for health care facilities will fall from Â£377m to Â£279m next year. Firms were worried they would face higher bills after the pandemic The Welsh NHS Confederation, which represents health organisations, said its ""members are disappointed in the lack of investment in capital infrastructure to improve and redesign NHS estates and facilities"". Cardiff University's Guto Ifan said the planned increase for NHS spending in Wales appears to be ""slightly below"" extra cash for Wales triggered because of NHS spending in England. ""There are huge uncertainties about the medium-term impact of the pandemic and these spending plans could well need to be revised upwards in later years."" Council funding will increase by Â£384m to Â£5.1bn - 8.1% in nominal terms or 5.2% when inflation is taken into account. Officials say this is the largest increase to the cash for local government - which is spent on social care and other services - since devolution began. Mr Ifan said councils should be able to meet their spending needs next year ""with relatively low increases in council tax"". The announcement follows a promise of more cash for Welsh public services from the Treasury, which provides the lion's share of the Welsh government's money. Experts at Cardiff University sayÂ£2.9bn will be available to spend by 2024. It also comes afteran agreementbetween the Welsh government and Plaid Cymru which included free school meals over three years and expanding free childcare to two-year-olds. Both were included in the budget, with Â£30m for early years and childcare, and Â£90m for free school meals over three years. The Vale Resort is starting to recover after a difficult 21 months According to the Welsh government, businesses in retail, leisure and hospitality will receive 50% rates relief for 2022-23, matching similar plans announced by Chancellor Rishi Sunak for England. It will be less than the 100% discount many such firms receive now. The scheme will be capped at Â£110,000 per business. With other relief schemes ministers say 85,000 properties will be supported, while a further Â£35m will be spent to freeze rates for 2022-23. Despite the announcement, Michael Manghan and Rhian Davies, who run the Crown and Sceptre in Cadoxton, Neath, are still concerned for what 2022 will hold. Ms Davies feared the rate bill they would now need to pay was a ""big chunk of money to find"". She said she would have like to have seen more, but added: ""It's better than nothing."" Mr Manghan said: ""The money we've lost over the last year - we're only just coming back to repay people."" Michael Manghan and Rhian Davies are concerned for the future of the business Sam Dabb, who runs Le Pub in Newport, was pleased to hear the news. ""It's one of the main costs of the business, it's absolutely massive."" One businessman said the Welsh government definitely had to meet the 50% cut introduced in England, and warned next year could be tough. The Vale Resort in Hensol, Vale of Glamorgan, is starting to recover after a difficult 21 months. Bookings have increased since Covid restrictions were lifted and the company has opened a distillery on site to expand the business. Its managing director, Stephen Leeke, said government support schemes such as furlough, business rate relief and the Economic Resilience Fund (ERF) had helped the company stay afloat. He said: ""There's certainly an argument to say that they might consider going further, because I think we are in for a bit of a roller coaster now in the next couple of months and I don't think there's any doubt the industry will need some support."" The Welsh government said it would spend Â£1.8bn on investments in its climate change department over three years, which includes Â£1.6bn on housing. Of that, Â£1bn will be spent on housing and Â£375m for building safety. Finance Minister Rebecca Evans said the Welsh government was still operating in a ""difficult financial context with our budget nearly Â£3bn lower than if it had increased in line with the economy since 2010-11"". ""This budget will support the Wales of today and shape the Wales of tomorrow. It will support our public services to be stronger, put Wales further down the path to being a net zero nation, and create a fairer nation with equality at its heart,"" she said. Welsh Conservative finance spokesman Peter Fox said: ""Today's budget has been made possible by the Conservative government delivering record funding for Wales. ""In that light, I welcome the much-needed business rates holiday to help firms recover from the ongoing challenges of the pandemic, along with an important uplift in funding for our local authorities who deliver so many key services in communities across Wales."" Llyr Gruffydd, Plaid Cymru finance spokesperson, said: ""Thanks to Plaid Cymru, this budget will deliver an even fairer, even greener, even stronger Wales through ambitious policy pledges. ""From free school meals for all primary pupils to extending free childcare to all two-year olds and much more, the commitments secured by Plaid Cymru as part of the co-operation agreement with Welsh government will secure transformational support for some of our poorest households and will change people's lives for the better across Wales."" There will be relief among the many thousands working in hospitality, retail and leisure across Wales. The Welsh government has matched what is happening in England and business rates for those industries will be halved. Most of them will still struggle to pay that as the pandemic continues to play havoc with trade with fewer people out shopping. With a new Welsh government department focused on climate change, it's hardly surprising that it's getting more money. What is interesting, and tells us about the departments priorities, is that of the Â£1.8bn for capital spending by the climate change minister almost all of it (Â£1.6bn) is to improve the quality and supply of housing. This budget is taking the long term view even though the immediate economic landscape is extremely fragile.

"Pret A Manger has received thousands of complaints over its drinks subscription service following frustration that not all promised beverages are available. The Â£20 a month deal offers unlimited hot and cold drinks. But the BBC understands the High Street chain has received 5,000 complaints about the offer, such as smoothies often being unavailable. Ex-Pret staff have also told the BBC its introduction has meant workers feel overwhelmed by the increased workload. Pret a Manger launched the subscription in September 2020 after sales plunged during Covid lockdowns. The company said it was ""really pleased"" with the response to the subscription offer where it pledges: ""If our Baristas brew it, blend it or steam it, you can have it!"" ""While it's been incredibly popular, we're constantly working with our teams and customers to make it better, so that we're able to continue to deliver the outstanding service our people are known for,"" the company said. But some customers said that this is not always the case. Rachel, from Watford, who had been on furlough for months, recently started commuting again. ""As I was now travelling into London again I thought I'd treat myself to drinks I wouldn't usually try,"" she told the BBC. ""But most of the time I'm told that I can't have a cold drink because they're unavailable."" Another customer, Brendan, also subscribed, limiting himself to two drinks a day ""to stay healthy"". But he told the BBC that by mid-afternoon mango and pineapple preference is often not available. ""It's become a long standing joke with the staff now,"" he said. ""I laughed it off for a while, but now I'm getting angry and I'm starting to feel I've been ripped off`."" Pret to hire 3,000 staff as city workers return Pret a Manger makes staff pay cuts permanent Meanwhile another customer, Isabelle, tweeted: ""Have been to four Prets this morning that have 'stopped doing smoothies'. Is this because of the subscription? The smoothies were a key part of me wanting to sign up."" Other customers have taken their complaints to the UK's Advertising Standards Authority (ASA). The regulator has contacted Pret a Manger to say that they should ""consider reviewing the ads for their subscription service"". The ASA said it informed  Pret ""that their ads should not state or imply that the service was available in all store locations, or that it covers their entire range of products if that wasn't the case"". Pret said: ""We have spoken with the ASA to ensure all Pret marketing for the coffee subscription is in accordance with their latest guidance."" Meanwhile, some former Pret employees said working conditions became ""unbearable"" after the subscription was launched. One claimed that staff deliberately turned blending machines off as it takes one-and-a-half minutes to prepare a smoothie. If a ""mystery shopper"" is in store they'll be marked down - with the team missing out on financial bonuses - if they don't deliver drinks within a strict time frame. He also alleges that other colleagues pretend the machines are broken, are being washed or there's a supply issue and they've run out of the small blue bags which contain a carefully portioned amount of fruit. ""Staff are just frustrated and tired with the endless smoothie and frappes giveaway, and they just boycott it, "" he said. ""It is just easy to say that ice or smoothies or frappe are gone for today. ""They are really time consuming. Try to make 50 smoothies daily one by one and you will feel it."" A Pret barista who recently quit revealed that he had worked for his store in the Thames Valley since it opened three years ago: ""But the whole demeanour changed when they brought in the subscription. The blending machines can't take it. ""I can understand why Pret think it makes commercial sense but the staff can't take much more."" Another Pret worker was so disgruntled with the conditions that she set up a website to gather complaints. The site, expret.org, is kept up to date with the latest frustrations, as she felt no one was listening to her or her colleagues. Pret claims that less than 1% of the complaints about their subscription are about the lack of smoothies or frappes. A spokesman added that when Pret suggested frappes and smoothies would be removed from the subscription earlier in 2021: ""There was a public outcry so Pret listened and kept them as part of the subscription."" In the same month Pret launched the deal, rival Leon offered a similar promotion for Â£15 a month - but it was limited to 75 coffees a month and excluded other drinks such as teas and hot chocolate. Leon has since suspended it, stating: ""To help our teams during these difficult times, we have stopped taking on new subscribers.""

"This video can not be played A green laser was shone at Chile president-elect Gabriel Boric as he made his victory speech on Sunday Leftist candidate Gabriel Boric has won Chile's presidential election to become the country's youngest ever leader. In what was expected to be a tight race, the 35-year-old former student protest leader defeated his far-right rival JosÃ© Antonio Kast by 10 points. Mr Boric told supporters he would look after democracy, promising curbs on Chile's neoliberal free market economy. He will lead a country that has been rocked in recent years by mass protests against inequality and corruption. Mr Boric's victory prompted celebrations on the streets of the capital Santiago, with his supporters waving flags and honking car horns. In his speech, Mr Boric said he was taking on the job with humility and a ""tremendous sense of responsibility"", vowing to ""firmly fight against the privileges of a few"". Official results gave Mr Boric 56% of the votes against Mr Kast's 44%. Mr Kast conceded defeat barely an hour-and-a-half after polls closed, and with around half of ballots counted. Both candidates offered starkly different visions for the country, and both are outsiders representing political parties that have never been in government. Jubilant supporters of Mr Boric reacted to his victory Once the most stable economy in Latin America, Chile has one of the world's largest income gaps, with 1% of the population owning 25% of the country's wealth, according to the United Nations. Mr Boric has promised to address this inequality by expanding social rights and reforming Chile's pension and healthcare systems, as well as reducing the work week from 45 to 40 hours, and boosting green investment. The president-elect also promised to block a controversial proposed mining project which he said would destroy communities and the national environment. Chile's currency, the peso, plunged to a record low against the US dollar after Mr Boric's victory. Stock markets fell by 10%, with mining stocks performing particularly badly. Investors are worried stability and profits will suffer as a result of higher taxes and tighter government regulation of business. Gabriel Boric's speech was one of inclusion, emphasising that everyone would be a protagonist in his government. And he said he would be a president for all, even those who had not voted for him. He knows that Congress is split and he has his political opponents, but he welcomed it as a chance for dialogue. This vote was deeply polarised, making Chileans decide between a man who praised the country's dictatorship and a protest leader who, his opponents said, would bring disorder and instability. But in the end Chileans voted for a new era. And a new kind of president. For many this result was a natural conclusion of the past few years. Protests exploded in 2019 with a rise in transport costs and, a year later, Chileans voted to rip-up the dictatorship-era constitution, and write a newer, more inclusive one. Now a new leader has come out of all of this. But one of Gabriel Boric's biggest challenges will be to unite the millions of Chileans who voted for the other side. Supporters responded to the victory with uncontained joy. ""I'm very excited because this is an achievement of the people,"" Andres Rodriques told Reuters news agency. ""There have been many years of abuse and we need a renovation within politics. I have a lot of faith and hope in the youth."" Patricia Alarcon said she was really happy. ""I always had faith in Boric because I think our country deserved this - we deserved freedom, integration - we deserved this result,"" she said. A former student protest leader, Mr Boric backed the mass demonstrations against inequality and alleged corruption that rocked Chile in 2019 and 2020. Conceding defeat, JosÃ© Antonio Kast said his rival ""deserves all our respect"" His rival, meanwhile, stood on a platform of law and order, pledging cuts to tax and social spending. Mr Kast also defended the legacy of Gen Pinochet, who took power in a coup and ruled the country from 1973 to 1990. Under his leadership more than 3,000 people were murdered by the state or disappeared. In a tweet,external, Mr Kast said he had called Mr Boric to congratulate him on his ""great triumph"", adding: ""From today he is the elected President of Chile and deserves all our respect and constructive collaboration"". PROFILE:From student protest leader to Chile's president ON THE GROUND:Dark past hangs over presidential run-off The country is going through huge changes after voting overwhelmingly last year to re-write Chile's Pinochet-era constitution. Outgoing President SebastiÃ¡n PiÃ±era said Chile was living in ""an environment of excessive polarisation, confrontation [and] disputes,"" and urged his successor to ""be the president of all Chileans"".

"The chancellor needs to ""get his act together"" and provide support for struggling hospitality businesses, the boss of two restaurant chains has said. David Page, chairman of the firm which runs the Real Greek and Franco Manca, said Rishi Sunak needed to provide financial help ""in the next 24 hours"". It comes as 100,000 retail, hospitality and leisure businesses called on government for more support. The government is yet to offer further measures for struggling businesses. Mr Page said the country was in ""lockdown by stealth"" due to government advice to limit social contacts. ""The chancellor better get his act together otherwise it's going to be a really horrible Christmas for our sector,"" said Mr Page, chairman of Fulham Shore. ""If you want a choice of restaurants the chancellor, needs to do something very, very quickly. ""I'm not sure any of the cabinet understand cash flow and cash flow is the problem at the moment, over the last week or two and over the next 10 days."" UK shoppers avoid High Streets amid Omicron fears Business alarm at prospect of more Covid measures Restaurants and pubs have been dealing with large numbers of cancellations in the run-up to Christmas as fears have risen over the spread of Omicron. The hospitality industry has estimated takings in December will be down by 40% - with the damage up to twice that in London. A letter to the chancellor, penned by 100,000 businesses, argued existing support from the government was ""insufficient"". Matthew Sims, head of Croydon Business Improvement District, said it was ""alarming"" that Mr Sunak was ""doggedly sticking to measures which are out of date and out of touch with the stark and desperate reality retail, hospitality and leisure businesses are facing"". Mr Page said that while city centre branches of Franco Manca and Real Greek restaurants were experiencing a dip in sales, trade in commuter areas across England was up. ""We have got a geographical spread, that helps us. If you're exposed to central London and you've only got one or two sites, you're in trouble at the moment,"" he said. Nick Mackenzie, boss of pub chain Greene King, said bookings had been ""decimated"" across the business amid the rapid spread of the Omicron coronavirus variant. He agreed with Mr Page that the country was in lockdown ""in all but name"", due to government messaging. He called on the government for ""urgent"" help, with others saying firms needed support ""in the next 24 hours"". Greene King, which manages 1,700 pubs and rents out 1,000, faced an ""incredibly difficult"" situation during what would usually be its busiest trading period of the year, Mr Mackenzie said. ""Demand has dropped, bookings have been decimated, in some parts of the country we are 70-80% down on 2019,"" he said. Mr Mackenzie said the government ""should be commended"" for the measures it brought in to help hospitality businesses earlier in the pandemic, but added that the situation was ""urgent again now"". ""We need them to move towards things like furlough support for [pubs] that we are having to close or those severely impacted, business rates relief, and removal of the cap on business rates."" The government has not ruled out bringing in further Covid restrictions before Christmas, with Health Secretary Sajid Javid telling the BBC's Andrew Marr Show there were ""no guarantees"" in a pandemic. Greene King said if it had to close sites due to government restrictions, the shut down and then reopening costs to the business would be about Â£5,000 per pub. The UK's food and drink wholesalers, which supply schools, care homes and hospitals as well as pubs and restaurants, have warned they face losing millions of pounds if a new lockdown is announced, with millions of tonnes of food currently in warehouses going to waste. The Federation of Wholesale Distributors (FWD) said businesses could ""no longer absorb the losses caused by last-minute closure of their customers"". Chancellor Mr Sunak met with representatives from the hospitality sector last Thursday to discuss their concerns, after Prime Minister Boris Johnson advised people to ""think carefully before you go"" out to socialise. The UK's chief medical officer Prof Chris Whitty also urged people not to ""mix with people you don't have to"". A Treasury spokesperson said: ""The chancellor has spoken to a range of business and industry leaders in recent days. ""We recognise how important the festive period is for so many businesses and the government will continue to engage constructively on how it can best provide ongoing support to the businesses and sectors affected.""

"England 192 all out, lose by 275 runs and trail series 2-0 Australia end tourists' resistance with 20.5 overs left in the day Buttler trods on stumps after brave 207-ball 26 Buttler & Woakes survive together for 31.2 overs after Pope & Stokes fall Use audio icon to listen to commentary shared between ABC and TMS Daily highlights programme on BBC iPlayer at 18:00 GMT Stephan Shemilt and Timothy Abraham Well, what a remarkable, and sometimes surreal, Test that was - and more disappointment for England on an already tough tour. Australia have won by 275 runs to take a dominant 2-0 series lead in the Ashes, with three matches left to play. Matthew Henry's report of how the hosts finally broke England's resistance is here. The scorecard is here. The Test Match Special podcast will be available later here. There are plenty of clips of all the action available on the BBC Sport website and app. And there will be full highlights available on BBC iPlayer at 18:00 GMT. We'll be back for the third Test in Melbourne, starting at 23:30 GMT on Christmas Day in the UK. Catch you then. For now - farewell. Final few words from Root on TMS:""You need to say 'over my dead body' and do the hard yards early on to get yourself in the game. ""That partnership from Jos and Woakesy was brilliant. It was over my dead boy stuff and we need more of that attitude, for five days and not just at the end of the game. ""Yesterday was a tough day for me but I feel a little better today and hopefully will be more myself in the next couple of days. I've been better."" Jonathan AgnewBBC cricket correspondent on BBC Test Match Special It sounds like there have been arguments in the England team about the lengths they should be bowling. More from Root on TMS:""We'll have to think about changes over the next couple of days, it's not the time to make emotional decisons ""We need to change what we're doing out on the field because it's not been good enough again. Asked if the series is realistically over:""No. I'm still convinced we can come back. It's so frusting because we're so much better than what we've done so far. ""I know the plans are right, we just need to execute them better. We need to show what we did today - that attitude and hunger - we have to take it into the next three games because that what it takes here."" Jonathan AgnewBBC cricket correspondent on BBC Test Match Special England have the players to compete. This isn't the hostile atmosphere you often get in Ashes series. Mitchell Starc had a laugh with Stuart Broad when he came out to bat. Australia are not making England's batters feel uncomfortable with sledging. Therefore it's purely a technical thing that England aren't scoring the runs. And they don't have the chance to play a warm-up, they're going to be facing the same bowlers - or Cummins and Hazlewood as well again - on Boxing Day. Allow Twitter content?

More from Root on TMS:""I'm talking about everything - in the field as well, we have to be better and take our chances. ""We have to get guys going on and making big scores. It's been the main difference between the sides in this series so far. If you don't match at least what they do in reasonable conditions then you can't put overs in their bowlers' legs. ""We did't leave the ball well enough again after last wek - we need to get this right in the rest of this series."" Steven FinnFormer England bowler on BBC Test Match Special I sense frustration from Root. I like the way he spoke about it. To build big totals in Australia you do have to soak up pressure and put miles in bowlers' legs. Australia did that here. Jonathan AgnewBBC cricket correspondent on BBC Test Match Special This Test did mirror the match here four years ago, although England put Australia in that time. Again we're talking about the bowling, but England should've scored 400 in their first innings and of course they fell short. Unless there's an absolute miracle, then you are out of the game conceding that deficit. I sound like a broken record but it's first innings runs that England need to work on. Along with the personnel selected, the apparent divide between batters and bowlers apportioning blame seems to be a strong theme in the fallout from this defeat in Adelaide. Jonathan AgnewBBC cricket correspondent on BBC Test Match Special I would stick with Rory Burns, because Zak Crawley is the alternative and he's had no cricket so you can't tell what form he is in. Ollie Pope is in trouble though. That was a good pitch to bat on and he got out twice in poor fashion. Steven FinnFormer England bowler on BBC Test Match Special Mark Wood should come back into the line-up but I'm not 100% who for. England did miss his pace in this Test. It then allows Ben Stokes to bowl the length that Cameron Green did and Stokes doesn't have to be the enforcer. That will suit England. England will have to consider playing a frontline spinner if the wicket is in any way conducive to spin. So that's either off-spinner Dom Bess or Jack Leach - but can they pick him after he was targeted at Brisbane? I'd like to see Ollie Pope keep his spot. He should have another go as the most promising young batter in England. Everyone else has to put it right - they've been picked as the seven best batters, they've got in a mess and have to be the ones to get England out of it. Jonathan AgnewBBC cricket correspondent on BBC Test Match Special England should pick Leach - Melbourne is a bigger ground than Brisbane so it may be harder for Australia to attack him there. And Wood has to come back. England need to win and they have to take chances. Woakes' bowling hasn't threatened so he perhaps drops out. That would make a long tail but England may have to do it to have the best chance of winning. What changes do England need to make to their side for the Boxing Day Test at the MCG? England captain Joe Root on Test Match Special:""We talk about what length to bowl all the time. We look at the data, what's going to hit the stumps on each surface. It's well communicated. But it's not always as simple as that and people get caught up in the emotion of the game. ""The guys did beat the edge a large amount but we have to be brave and bowl a bit fuller to create more chances. ""The most disappointing thing is we made the same mistakes again in this game as we did last week."" Here's the moment Australia wrapped up the Test to take a 2-0 lead. More from stand-in Australia captain Steve Smith:""Mitchell Starc bowled as well as he has for a long time, he led this attack well. He summed it up quickly that there wasn't a great deal of swing so he just wanted to bash a good length and hit some good areas - he did that as well as he has in his career. ""Part of our Covid protocols are going to level four from level three. We will do what we need to do. Fortunately we've been able to play cricket and entertain during this difficult period in people's lives and we'll keep doing that and stick to the protocols in place."" Sir Alastair CookFormer England captain on BT Sport England seem a slow side to adjust to situations. They only seemed to see leaving the ball as a positive option in the second innings. The same with bowling fuller. These things should happen with instruction from the coach ahead of the game. Jonathan AgnewBBC cricket correspondent on BBC Test Match Special Joe Root would not have said that publicly unless he wanted to get that message across to his bowlers. Steven FinnFormer England bowler on BBC Test Match Special Joe Root sounded angry. He said it with venom that they bowled too short and adjusted too late. The thing that would frustrate me would be if that wasn't communicated to the bowlers. You'd hope it would be.

Australia have won by 275 runs to take a dominant 2-0 series lead in the Ashes, with three matches left to play. Matthew Henry's report of how the hosts finally broke England's resistance is here. The scorecard is here. The Test Match Special podcast will be available later here. There are plenty of clips of all the action available on the BBC Sport website and app. And there will be full highlights available on BBC iPlayer at 18:00 GMT.

Final few words from Root on TMS:""You need to say 'over my dead body' and do the hard yards early on to get yourself in the game. ""That partnership from Jos and Woakesy was brilliant. It was over my dead boy stuff and we need more of that attitude, for five days and not just at the end of the game. ""Yesterday was a tough day for me but I feel a little better today and hopefully will be more myself in the next couple of days. I've been better."" Jonathan AgnewBBC cricket correspondent on BBC Test Match Special It sounds like there have been arguments in the England team about the lengths they should be bowling. More from Root on TMS:""We'll have to think about changes over the next couple of days, it's not the time to make emotional decisons ""We need to change what we're doing out on the field because it's not been good enough again. Asked if the series is realistically over:""No. I'm still convinced we can come back. It's so frusting because we're so much better than what we've done so far. ""I know the plans are right, we just need to execute them better. We need to show what we did today - that attitude and hunger - we have to take it into the next three games because that what it takes here."" Jonathan AgnewBBC cricket correspondent on BBC Test Match Special England have the players to compete. This isn't the hostile atmosphere you often get in Ashes series. Mitchell Starc had a laugh with Stuart Broad when he came out to bat. Australia are not making England's batters feel uncomfortable with sledging. Therefore it's purely a technical thing that England aren't scoring the runs. And they don't have the chance to play a warm-up, they're going to be facing the same bowlers - or Cummins and Hazlewood as well again - on Boxing Day. Allow Twitter content?

More from Root on TMS:""I'm talking about everything - in the field as well, we have to be better and take our chances. ""We have to get guys going on and making big scores. It's been the main difference between the sides in this series so far. If you don't match at least what they do in reasonable conditions then you can't put overs in their bowlers' legs. ""We did't leave the ball well enough again after last wek - we need to get this right in the rest of this series."" Steven FinnFormer England bowler on BBC Test Match Special I sense frustration from Root. I like the way he spoke about it. To build big totals in Australia you do have to soak up pressure and put miles in bowlers' legs. Australia did that here. Jonathan AgnewBBC cricket correspondent on BBC Test Match Special This Test did mirror the match here four years ago, although England put Australia in that time. Again we're talking about the bowling, but England should've scored 400 in their first innings and of course they fell short. Unless there's an absolute miracle, then you are out of the game conceding that deficit. I sound like a broken record but it's first innings runs that England need to work on. Along with the personnel selected, the apparent divide between batters and bowlers apportioning blame seems to be a strong theme in the fallout from this defeat in Adelaide. Jonathan AgnewBBC cricket correspondent on BBC Test Match Special I would stick with Rory Burns, because Zak Crawley is the alternative and he's had no cricket so you can't tell what form he is in. Ollie Pope is in trouble though. That was a good pitch to bat on and he got out twice in poor fashion. Steven FinnFormer England bowler on BBC Test Match Special Mark Wood should come back into the line-up but I'm not 100% who for. England did miss his pace in this Test. It then allows Ben Stokes to bowl the length that Cameron Green did and Stokes doesn't have to be the enforcer. That will suit England. England will have to consider playing a frontline spinner if the wicket is in any way conducive to spin. So that's either off-spinner Dom Bess or Jack Leach - but can they pick him after he was targeted at Brisbane? I'd like to see Ollie Pope keep his spot. He should have another go as the most promising young batter in England. Everyone else has to put it right - they've been picked as the seven best batters, they've got in a mess and have to be the ones to get England out of it. Jonathan AgnewBBC cricket correspondent on BBC Test Match Special England should pick Leach - Melbourne is a bigger ground than Brisbane so it may be harder for Australia to attack him there. And Wood has to come back. England need to win and they have to take chances. Woakes' bowling hasn't threatened so he perhaps drops out. That would make a long tail but England may have to do it to have the best chance of winning. What changes do England need to make to their side for the Boxing Day Test at the MCG? England captain Joe Root on Test Match Special:""We talk about what length to bowl all the time. We look at the data, what's going to hit the stumps on each surface. It's well communicated. But it's not always as simple as that and people get caught up in the emotion of the game. ""The guys did beat the edge a large amount but we have to be brave and bowl a bit fuller to create more chances. ""The most disappointing thing is we made the same mistakes again in this game as we did last week."" Here's the moment Australia wrapped up the Test to take a 2-0 lead. More from stand-in Australia captain Steve Smith:""Mitchell Starc bowled as well as he has for a long time, he led this attack well. He summed it up quickly that there wasn't a great deal of swing so he just wanted to bash a good length and hit some good areas - he did that as well as he has in his career. ""Part of our Covid protocols are going to level four from level three. We will do what we need to do. Fortunately we've been able to play cricket and entertain during this difficult period in people's lives and we'll keep doing that and stick to the protocols in place."" Sir Alastair CookFormer England captain on BT Sport England seem a slow side to adjust to situations. They only seemed to see leaving the ball as a positive option in the second innings. The same with bowling fuller. These things should happen with instruction from the coach ahead of the game. Jonathan AgnewBBC cricket correspondent on BBC Test Match Special Joe Root would not have said that publicly unless he wanted to get that message across to his bowlers. Steven FinnFormer England bowler on BBC Test Match Special Joe Root sounded angry. He said it with venom that they bowled too short and adjusted too late. The thing that would frustrate me would be if that wasn't communicated to the bowlers. You'd hope it would be.

"Plans to raise the state pension age from 66 should be shelved because we are not living as long as previously expected, a new report has suggested. Current plans would see the age at which people are eligible for the state pension go up to 67 by 2028, and then eventually to 68. Consultant LCP says life expectancy has stalled and no changes should be made for 30 years. The government has just launched its latest review of the state pension age. At present: The full, new flat-rate state pension (for those who reached state pension age after April 2016) is Â£179.60 a week The full, old basic state pension (for those who reached state pension age before April 2016) is Â£137.60 a week. They may also get a Pension Credit top-up Men and women are now entitled to claim the state pension from 66 - an age which had increased steadily until October last year. Under government plans state pension age would rise to 67 this decade, and 68 as early as 2039. This is based on calculations that ensure no-one spends more than one third of their adult life in retirement. However, since those plans were drawn up, official estimates of longevity have been scaled back, even before the effect of the Covid pandemic. As a result, LCP argues that the move to 67 should not come until 2051, and the rise to 68 not before the mid-2060s. Such an initial move would benefit 20 million people born in the 1960s, 1970s or early 1980s, but cost the Treasury an estimated Â£200bn. Steve Webb, partner at LCP and a former pensions minister, said: ""The government's plans for rapid increases in state pension age have been blown out of the water by this new analysis. ""Even before the pandemic hit, the improvements in life expectancy which we had seen over the last century had almost ground to a halt, but the schedule for state pension age increases has not caught up with this new world."" He said the government's plans should be revisited as ""a matter of urgency"" and there was ""no case"" for another state pension age increase so soon. State pension age hits 66 and set to rise further Triple lock pension pledge suspended for one year Earlier this month, the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) announced that the next review of the state pension age would start, headed by Baroness Neville Rolfe. ""The government needs to make sure that decisions on how to manage its costs are, robust, fair and transparent for taxpayers now and in the future. It must also ensure that as the population becomes older, the state pension continues to provide the foundation for retirement planning and financial security,"" the DWP said. Pensions experts have called for a rethink in the way state pension ages are calculated. Baroness Ros Altmann, also a former pensions minister, said the current system helped the healthy and wealthy, but not those likely to die early. ""At the moment, the state pension only has flexibility for those who are healthy and wealthy enough to wait longer. If they start their pension later they can receive a higher amount. But those in poor health with no private provision, cannot get any money sooner, even at a reduced rate,"" she said. Becky O'Connor, head of pensions and savings at Interactive Investor, said: ""The idea of a long, enjoyable retirement seems set to be consigned to the history books. ""Many will have spent much of their working life expecting to retire at 65. They have been disappointed before and look set to be disappointed again. It is no wonder today's younger workers have little faith in the state pension being there for them at all when they stop work, with many thinking they will end up working forever.""

"Northern Ireland's Covid-19 booster vaccination programme has opened to over 18s who received their second dose at least three months ago. It comes as the chief medical officer says that Omicron could be the most dominant variant in NI by Christmas. Earlier, Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill said that the Omicron variant of Covid-19 will hit Northern Ireland ""like a tonne of bricks"". She warned of up to 30,000 new cases a day in the ""worst-case scenario"". There are 1,281 confirmed Omicron cases in Northern but sources have told BBC News NI that the number is likely to be much higher. Lines were forming outside at South Lake Leisure Centre in Craigavon for vaccines Chief medical officer Prof Sir Michael McBride warned that Omicron is spreading rapidly and urged those eligible to come forward for their booster Covid-19 jab, in a bid to curb the spread of the new Omicron variant. Health trusts are operating walk-in booster vaccination clinic, with up-to-date information on each trust's social media platforms, the Department of Health said. Over 30s can currentlybook a slot online,external, while bookings are expected to be made available for people in the 18 to 29-year-old age group in the next few days. The chief medical officer said people ""need to keep making safer choices in our daily lives"" He said he understood that people are worried about ""potential effects of the booster in the run-up to Christmas"". ""My advice to them is straightforward; the potential effects of Covid are much more concerning,"" he said. ""The vast majority of reactions to the vaccines are minor and short-lived, like having a sore arm for a day."" NI records five more deaths, 2,075 new cases Your coronavirus questions answered What are Northern Ireland's Covid travel rules? Speaking earlier on theBBC's Sunday Politics programme, Ms O'Neill said added the next few weeks could be the worst and most challenging period of the pandemic. The Sinn FÃ©in minister said ministers were working ""around the clock"" with public health officials to work out what measures need to be introduced and when. But she said Stormont needed more money in order to support businesses through any potential new restrictions. Michelle O'Neill said the next few weeks had potential to be the most challenging She said the timing would be crucial and added that further information from health officials is expected on Monday which will help ministers understand the potential impact of Omicron on Northern Ireland's hospitals. However, Ms O'Neill said she expected the volume of cases to be ""overwhelming"". ""We know that we will peak in the middle of January, we know that it's going to spread very rapidly, but what we don't yet know is the impact in terms of our hospital situation.""

Ms O'Neill and other ministers are meeting on Sunday, Monday and Tuesday informally, ahead of a planned executive meeting on Wednesday, when they are expected to announce details of how they plan to curb the spread of the variant. However, the deputy first minister said action could be announced earlier than Wednesday if necessary. Hospitals in Northern Ireland could be under even more pressure in January, say health officials She restated public health officials' advice that a ""significant intervention"" would be needed to mitigate against the spread of Omicron. But she said the nature, the timing and the duration of that intervention was yet to be decided by ministers. Ms O'Neill added that ""everything is on the table"" in terms of the actions that might be required. But she said there was ""a danger of moving too early"", in terms of imposing further Covid-19 restrictions. ""The public health officials' advice is to wait. We're very much being led by the health and scientific advice,"" said Ms O'Neill. In terms of financial support for businesses which may face further disruption to their trade, the deputy first minister said she was meeting Treasury staff later on Sunday to make the case for more funding. ""We need money in order to support interventions because health [officials] are telling us that the booster programme in itself isn't enough,"" she said. ""We need to be able to support businesses if we have to intervene. You cannot do this without money."" On Sunday,two more deaths with Covid-19 were recordedby the Department of Health in Northern Ireland. Earlier,the Republic of Ireland's Chief Medical Officer Dr Tony Holohan announced that more than half of new Covid-19 cases there are believed to be Omicron cases, meaning it is now the Republic's dominant variant. From Monday,stricter Covid-19 restrictions will be in operationin the Republic.

Australia have won by 275 runs to take a dominant 2-0 series lead in the Ashes, with three matches left to play. Matthew Henry's report of how the hosts finally broke England's resistance is here. The scorecard is here. The Test Match Special podcast will be available later here. There are plenty of clips of all the action available on the BBC Sport website and app. And there will be full highlights available on BBC iPlayer at 18:00 GMT. We'll be back for the third Test in Melbourne, starting at 23:30 GMT on Christmas Day in the UK. Catch you then. For now - farewell. Final few words from Root on TMS:""You need to say 'over my dead body' and do the hard yards early on to get yourself in the game. ""That partnership from Jos and Woakesy was brilliant. It was over my dead boy stuff and we need more of that attitude, for five days and not just at the end of the game. ""Yesterday was a tough day for me but I feel a little better today and hopefully will be more myself in the next couple of days. I've been better."" Jonathan AgnewBBC cricket correspondent on BBC Test Match Special It sounds like there have been arguments in the England team about the lengths they should be bowling. More from Root on TMS:""We'll have to think about changes over the next couple of days, it's not the time to make emotional decisons ""We need to change what we're doing out on the field because it's not been good enough again. Asked if the series is realistically over:""No. I'm still convinced we can come back. It's so frusting because we're so much better than what we've done so far. ""I know the plans are right, we just need to execute them better. We need to show what we did today - that attitude and hunger - we have to take it into the next three games because that what it takes here."" Jonathan AgnewBBC cricket correspondent on BBC Test Match Special England have the players to compete. This isn't the hostile atmosphere you often get in Ashes series. Mitchell Starc had a laugh with Stuart Broad when he came out to bat. Australia are not making England's batters feel uncomfortable with sledging. Therefore it's purely a technical thing that England aren't scoring the runs. And they don't have the chance to play a warm-up, they're going to be facing the same bowlers - or Cummins and Hazlewood as well again - on Boxing Day. Allow Twitter content?

More from Root on TMS:""I'm talking about everything - in the field as well, we have to be better and take our chances. ""We have to get guys going on and making big scores. It's been the main difference between the sides in this series so far. If you don't match at least what they do in reasonable conditions then you can't put overs in their bowlers' legs. ""We did't leave the ball well enough again after last wek - we need to get this right in the rest of this series."" Steven FinnFormer England bowler on BBC Test Match Special I sense frustration from Root. I like the way he spoke about it. To build big totals in Australia you do have to soak up pressure and put miles in bowlers' legs. Australia did that here. Jonathan AgnewBBC cricket correspondent on BBC Test Match Special This Test did mirror the match here four years ago, although England put Australia in that time. Again we're talking about the bowling, but England should've scored 400 in their first innings and of course they fell short. Unless there's an absolute miracle, then you are out of the game conceding that deficit. I sound like a broken record but it's first innings runs that England need to work on. Along with the personnel selected, the apparent divide between batters and bowlers apportioning blame seems to be a strong theme in the fallout from this defeat in Adelaide. Jonathan AgnewBBC cricket correspondent on BBC Test Match Special I would stick with Rory Burns, because Zak Crawley is the alternative and he's had no cricket so you can't tell what form he is in. Ollie Pope is in trouble though. That was a good pitch to bat on and he got out twice in poor fashion. Steven FinnFormer England bowler on BBC Test Match Special Mark Wood should come back into the line-up but I'm not 100% who for. England did miss his pace in this Test. It then allows Ben Stokes to bowl the length that Cameron Green did and Stokes doesn't have to be the enforcer. That will suit England. England will have to consider playing a frontline spinner if the wicket is in any way conducive to spin. So that's either off-spinner Dom Bess or Jack Leach - but can they pick him after he was targeted at Brisbane? I'd like to see Ollie Pope keep his spot. He should have another go as the most promising young batter in England. Everyone else has to put it right - they've been picked as the seven best batters, they've got in a mess and have to be the ones to get England out of it. Jonathan AgnewBBC cricket correspondent on BBC Test Match Special England should pick Leach - Melbourne is a bigger ground than Brisbane so it may be harder for Australia to attack him there. And Wood has to come back. England need to win and they have to take chances. Woakes' bowling hasn't threatened so he perhaps drops out. That would make a long tail but England may have to do it to have the best chance of winning. What changes do England need to make to their side for the Boxing Day Test at the MCG? England captain Joe Root on Test Match Special:""We talk about what length to bowl all the time. We look at the data, what's going to hit the stumps on each surface. It's well communicated. But it's not always as simple as that and people get caught up in the emotion of the game. ""The guys did beat the edge a large amount but we have to be brave and bowl a bit fuller to create more chances. ""The most disappointing thing is we made the same mistakes again in this game as we did last week."" Here's the moment Australia wrapped up the Test to take a 2-0 lead. More from stand-in Australia captain Steve Smith:""Mitchell Starc bowled as well as he has for a long time, he led this attack well. He summed it up quickly that there wasn't a great deal of swing so he just wanted to bash a good length and hit some good areas - he did that as well as he has in his career. ""Part of our Covid protocols are going to level four from level three. We will do what we need to do. Fortunately we've been able to play cricket and entertain during this difficult period in people's lives and we'll keep doing that and stick to the protocols in place."" Sir Alastair CookFormer England captain on BT Sport England seem a slow side to adjust to situations. They only seemed to see leaving the ball as a positive option in the second innings. The same with bowling fuller. These things should happen with instruction from the coach ahead of the game. Jonathan AgnewBBC cricket correspondent on BBC Test Match Special Joe Root would not have said that publicly unless he wanted to get that message across to his bowlers. Steven FinnFormer England bowler on BBC Test Match Special Joe Root sounded angry. He said it with venom that they bowled too short and adjusted too late. The thing that would frustrate me would be if that wasn't communicated to the bowlers. You'd hope it would be. There has to be an element of acceptance that Australia bowled fuller and got more outside edge. When you're asked to bowl first your mentality is a bit more defensive than when you decied to bowl first. In that mindset you can bowl a little bit shorter and that's why the Australians left more on length. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Foreign Secretary Liz Truss will replace Lord Frost as the UK's lead negotiator with the EU in post-Brexit talks. She will retain her role as foreign minister alongside the new post leading negotiations over the Northern Ireland Protocol. It followsthe resignation of Lord Frostas Brexit minister on Saturday. MP Chris Heaton-Harris will become minister of state for Europe, Downing Street said. Mr Heaton-Harris will be replaced at the transport department by Wendy Morton, who was previously at the Foreign Office. Lord Frost resigns as Brexit minister Dorries ousted from WhatsApp group for praising PM Lord Frost's resignation letter in full Conservative MPsare split over the departure of Lord Frost, who resigned citing ""concerns about the current direction of travel"" of the government. The peer told Prime Minister Boris Johnson he had concerns over Covid policy, urging him to avoid introducing ""coercive measures"". Some Tory backbench MPs who share Lord Frost's views described his exit as a ""disaster"". But others in the party said it offered a chance to ""press the reset button"" in negotiations with the EU. Liz Truss has a lot of jobs. She's the foreign secretary, the minister for women and equalities, and now the lead negotiator with the EU on the Northern Ireland Protocol. This is a monster brief. Particularly noteworthy therefore is the appointment of her deputy, Chris Heaton-Harris - a former MEP who supported Leave in 2016. His presence may appease some Tory backbenchers who were particularly unhappy to see Lord Frost go. But will Liz Truss approach negotiations with the EU like her predecessor? It's early days but I've heard initial suggestions that there won't be a radical departure on policy. However the UK's approach, pre-Truss, was already softening in certain areas. A source close to the foreign secretary said: ""Liz and David are friends and come at things from the same direction but Liz will put her own stamp on it and do it the Liz Truss way."" But no matter how confident the foreign secretary may feel, she's inheriting a hard, and politically sensitive, task. Ms Truss campaigned for Remain ahead of the 2016 EU referendum, saying continued membership of the EU was ""in Britain's economic interest"". She has since said she would back Brexit, if another referendum were to be held. Maros Sefcovic, the EU's lead post-Brexit negotiator, said he would ""continue to co-operate with the UK in the same constructive spirit on all important tasks ahead, including the Protocol on Ireland/Northern Ireland"". The Northern Ireland Protocol has remained a sticking point since it was struck between the UK and EU in 2019, with some businesses saying it makes it more difficult to send goods to Northern Ireland from Great Britain. In a statement on Friday, Lord Frost said of recent talks over gaps between the UK and EU: ""There has been some progress, but not as much, and not as quickly as we had hoped."" Labour's Baroness Chapman said that, while she congratulated Ms Truss on her appointment, the government must ""now stop their needless posturing and work to reach an agreement"". Elizabeth Truss became foreign secretary at the last reshuffle in September - replacing Dominic Raab. Her rise to one of the great offices of state has seen her navigate a fast track through Whitehall - taking on her first government job just two years after first being elected as MP for south west Norfolk in 2010. She began in the education department, before moving to become secretary of state for environment, food and rural affairs in 2014. She was Lord Chancellor and justice secretary in 2016 - then chief secretary to the Treasury until 2019 when she became international trade secretary. In this role, Ms Truss helped the UK deliver a number of post-Brexit trade deals with countries including Japan, Australia and New Zealand. Liz Truss: Fast tracker who landed prime role Lord Frost's resignation came aftera major by-election defeatfor the Conservatives, losing the formerly safe seat of North Shropshire to the Liberal Democrats. In his resignation letter, Lord Frost spoke of disagreement with tightened coronavirus restrictions in England that saw Mr Johnson endure his biggest Commons rebellion so far.

Steven FinnFormer England bowler on BBC Test Match Special Joe Root sounded angry. He said it with venom that they bowled too short and adjusted too late. The thing that would frustrate me would be if that wasn't communicated to the bowlers. You'd hope it would be. There has to be an element of acceptance that Australia bowled fuller and got more outside edge. When you're asked to bowl first your mentality is a bit more defensive than when you decied to bowl first. In that mindset you can bowl a little bit shorter and that's why the Australians left more on length. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Almost half of the seats went to candidates picked by the pro-Beijing Election Committee Pro-Beijing candidates have claimed a victory in Hong Kong's Legislative Council (LegCo) election, as the city saw its lowest-ever voter turnout. It was the first LegCo election since China made sweeping and controversial changes to the city's electoral system. Officials argue the changes were needed to ensure stability, but critics say they weakened democracy. On Monday, Beijing also unveiled a statement outlining ""democracy with Hong Kong characteristics"". In a white paper released hours after election results were announced, China said Hong Kong was now entering a new stage of ""restored order"" as a result of these Beijing-introduced changes. Why Hong Kong's elections are so controversial What is China's 'patriot' plan for Hong Kong? How is Hong Kong run? But a group of Western nations expressed ""grave concern over the erosion of democratic elements"" in Hong Kong's electoral system. ""Since handover, candidates with diverse political views have contested elections in Hong Kong. Yesterday's election has reversed this trend,"" the foreign ministers of Australia, Canada and New Zealand, the British foreign secretary and US secretary of state said in a statement. ""These changes eliminated any political opposition."" The LegCo, Hong Kong's mini-parliament, is a powerful body that makes and amends laws in the city. One analysis by local news outlet HK01 found that 82 of the 90 seats were won by members from pro-establishment and pro-Beijing camp. Only one candidate was from a non-establishment camp, and the rest had unknown political backgrounds. Government officials had urged the city's 4.5 million registered voters to take part in the election, and had made public transport on Sunday free as well as sent out mass texts to encourage a higher turnout. But in the end only 30.2% of voters participated, amid wide apathy about the poll. One woman, an accountant in her 20s, told AFP news agency: ""My vote won't mean anything because ultimately it's Beijing's people winning."" Some activists were arrested after they had urged people to boycott the election or to leave their ballots blank as a protest. While casting a blank vote is legal, it is now against the law to incite anyone to do so, or to encourage them not to vote. People queue to vote at a polling station In March, Beijing had passed a ""patriots governing Hong Kong"" resolution that fundamentally altered LegCo. It drastically shrank the proportion of lawmakers who can be directly voted in by the people; ensured candidates had to be vetted by a separate screening committee; and gave seats to the Election Committee, a group that heavily skews pro-Beijing. Only 20 of the 90 legislative seats were directly elected by the public. Nearly half were picked by the pro-Beijing Election Committee and the rest chosen by special interest groups like business and trade - which also historically lean towards Beijing. The move was widely seen as a continuation of China's plan to tighten control over Hong Kong and push for loyalty from all levels of power, following 2019's huge pro-democracy protests. It was also the first general election since China introduced a new national security law, making it easier to punish pro-democracy protesters. Analysis by Martin Yip, BBC Chinese, Hong Kong For journalists, it has been an uneventful night at the press centre. But for the biggest pro-Beijing party, the DAB, it is a night of triumph. ""DAB sure win,"" they chanted.  The more seats they won, the louder they chanted. Just as people thought the ""non-establishment"" camp was to face a total loss, one candidate managed to win. This newbie legislator, Dik Chi-yuen, will from now on be the only opposition in this 90-seat legislature. But even he - as with all the other candidates - has been pre-approved by a separate committee and deemed to be loyal to Beijing. Then comes Beijing's white paper. It repeats a long-existing rhetoric that Britain gave Hong Kong no democracy, and the introduction of the LegCo election just a few years before the 1997 handover was nothing but a conspiracy to extend Britain's colonial control over the Chinese territory. The Communist Party of China ""designed, created, safeguarded and advanced Hong Kong's system of democracy"", it insists. Beijing now defines democracy on its own terms. The struggle for power over discourse goes on. The white paper is the second of its kind to be released by Beijing on Hong Kong's political reforms. In it, China insists that it had ""provided constant support to the [Hong Kong Special Administrative Region] in developing its democratic system"", ever since the ""one country, two systems"" principle was implemented. Under that principle, Hong Kong is promised certain democratic freedoms which no other part of mainland China has. It is enshrined in an agreement signed before Britain handed Hong Kong back to China in 1997. The UK, as well as rights groups, have accused Beijing of reneging on this principle with its recent changes to Hong Kong's laws. The white paper went on to accuse ""anti-China agitators"" of causing ""damaging social unrest"" in Hong Kong, and labelled their attempts to stage pro-democracy protests as ""a pretext."" It then asserted the electoral reforms and the national security law introduced by Beijing had paved the way in addressing ""the symptoms and root causes of the unrest"" and ""restored order"" to Hong Kong. The last white paper was released  in June 2014, three months before the Occupy protests erupted that brought downtown Hong Kong to a standstill.

"Foreign Secretary Liz Truss will replace Lord Frost as the UK's lead negotiator with the EU in post-Brexit talks. She will retain her role as foreign minister alongside the new post leading negotiations over the Northern Ireland Protocol. It followsthe resignation of Lord Frostas Brexit minister on Saturday. MP Chris Heaton-Harris will become minister of state for Europe, Downing Street said. Mr Heaton-Harris will be replaced at the transport department by Wendy Morton, who was previously at the Foreign Office. Lord Frost resigns as Brexit minister Dorries ousted from WhatsApp group for praising PM Lord Frost's resignation letter in full Conservative MPsare split over the departure of Lord Frost, who resigned citing ""concerns about the current direction of travel"" of the government. The peer told Prime Minister Boris Johnson he had concerns over Covid policy, urging him to avoid introducing ""coercive measures"". Some Tory backbench MPs who share Lord Frost's views described his exit as a ""disaster"". But others in the party said it offered a chance to ""press the reset button"" in negotiations with the EU. Liz Truss has a lot of jobs. She's the foreign secretary, the minister for women and equalities, and now the lead negotiator with the EU on the Northern Ireland Protocol. This is a monster brief. Particularly noteworthy therefore is the appointment of her deputy, Chris Heaton-Harris - a former MEP who supported Leave in 2016. His presence may appease some Tory backbenchers who were particularly unhappy to see Lord Frost go. But will Liz Truss approach negotiations with the EU like her predecessor? It's early days but I've heard initial suggestions that there won't be a radical departure on policy. However the UK's approach, pre-Truss, was already softening in certain areas. A source close to the foreign secretary said: ""Liz and David are friends and come at things from the same direction but Liz will put her own stamp on it and do it the Liz Truss way."" But no matter how confident the foreign secretary may feel, she's inheriting a hard, and politically sensitive, task. Ms Truss campaigned for Remain ahead of the 2016 EU referendum, saying continued membership of the EU was ""in Britain's economic interest"". She has since said she would back Brexit, if another referendum were to be held. Maros Sefcovic, the EU's lead post-Brexit negotiator, said he would ""continue to co-operate with the UK in the same constructive spirit on all important tasks ahead, including the Protocol on Ireland/Northern Ireland"". The Northern Ireland Protocol has remained a sticking point since it was struck between the UK and EU in 2019, with some businesses saying it makes it more difficult to send goods to Northern Ireland from Great Britain. In a statement on Friday, Lord Frost said of recent talks over gaps between the UK and EU: ""There has been some progress, but not as much, and not as quickly as we had hoped."" Labour's Baroness Chapman said that, while she congratulated Ms Truss on her appointment, the government must ""now stop their needless posturing and work to reach an agreement"". Elizabeth Truss became foreign secretary at the last reshuffle in September - replacing Dominic Raab. Her rise to one of the great offices of state has seen her navigate a fast track through Whitehall - taking on her first government job just two years after first being elected as MP for south west Norfolk in 2010. She began in the education department, before moving to become secretary of state for environment, food and rural affairs in 2014. She was Lord Chancellor and justice secretary in 2016 - then chief secretary to the Treasury until 2019 when she became international trade secretary. In this role, Ms Truss helped the UK deliver a number of post-Brexit trade deals with countries including Japan, Australia and New Zealand. Liz Truss: Fast tracker who landed prime role Lord Frost's resignation came aftera major by-election defeatfor the Conservatives, losing the formerly safe seat of North Shropshire to the Liberal Democrats. In his resignation letter, Lord Frost spoke of disagreement with tightened coronavirus restrictions in England that saw Mr Johnson endure his biggest Commons rebellion so far.
