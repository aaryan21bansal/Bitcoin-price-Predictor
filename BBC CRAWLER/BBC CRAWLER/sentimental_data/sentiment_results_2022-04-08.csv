"Chancellor Rishi Sunak's wife Akshata Murty has said she will pay UK taxes on her overseas income, following a row over her non-domicile status. She owns Â£700m in shares of the Indian IT giant Infosys, founded by her father, from which she received Â£11.6m in dividend income last year. As a non-domiciled (non-dom) UK resident she is not required by law to pay UK taxes on her overseas income. But she told the BBC she did not want to be a ""distraction"" for her husband. Her decision to change her tax arrangements follows accusations of hypocrisy against the chancellor, with opposition parties saying Mr Sunak's family is benefiting at a time when the cost of living is going up. The BBC estimates Ms Murty would have avoided Â£2.1m a year in UK tax through her non-dom status. Ms Murty said her tax arrangements had been ""entirely legal"", but added: ""It has become clear that many do not feel it is compatible with my husband's role as chancellor. ""I understand and appreciate the British sense of fairness and I do not wish my tax status to be a distraction for my husband or to affect my family."" Anon-domis someone who lives in the UK but declares their permanent home to be in another country. Sunak held US green card until last year Smearing my wife to get at me is awful, says Sunak Whatever happened to Sunak's political honeymoon? Mr Sunak has accused political opponents of ""smearing"" his wife to get at him. He has also said she is entitled to use the non-dom arrangement as she is an Indian citizen and plans to move back to her home country in the future to care for her parents. Ms Murty will retain her Indian citizenship and her non-dom status which,as the BBC revealed,allows her family to avoid paying inheritance tax in the UK - which at current valuation could amount to Â£280m. On Thursday, it emerged she pays Â£30,000 a year to maintain her non-dom status. In her statement, Ms Murty also said she would now be paying UK tax ""on all my worldwide income, including dividends and capital gains, wherever in the world that income arises"". ""I do this because I want to, not because the rules require me to. These new arrangements will begin immediately and will also be applied to the tax year just finished (2021-22),"" she added. Labour MP Louise Haigh said Mr Sunak had ""not been transparent"". The shadow transport secretary said: ""It is clear that was legal. ""I think the question many people will be asking is whether it was ethical and whether it was right that the Chancellor of the Exchequer, whilst piling on 15 separate tax rises to the British public, was benefiting from a tax scheme that allowed his household to pay significantly less to the tune of potentially tens of millions of pounds."" Lib Dem Treasury spokesperson Christine Jardine called on the Sunak household to backdate the taxes in full, adding: ""Doing something just because you've been found out isn't good enough."" While one former cabinet minister said he had ""mild sympathy"" for Mr Sunak as he had been subjected to a ""nasty ad hominem"" attack, he added that every leadership candidate, declared or otherwise, should expect this. He was naÃ¯ve if he thought families were ""off-limits for attacks"". His view was that the tax row could be as toxic for the chancellor as partygate has been for Mr Johnson. It was all about a disconnect with ordinary voters. They could not hold a children's birthday party during lockdown, but boozy get-togethers were apparently held at the heart of government. Similarly, their taxes were being put up by the chancellor, while his wife did not pay UK tax on some of her own earnings. Read Iain's full analysishere. Speaking to the Sun newspaper, Mr Sunak said it was unfair to attack his wife as she was a ""private citizen"", adding: ""I'm an elected politician. So I know what I signed up for."" It comes on the same day it was revealed thatthe couple retained their rights to live and work in the USby having green cards - which requires holders to consider America their permanent home - for more than a year after Mr Sunak became chancellor in 2020. He returned his green card in October last year, ahead of his first US trip as a UK government minister. Asked about the issue at a White House daily media briefing, press secretary Jen Psaki said it was a matter for other government departments and declined to comment. A spokeswoman for Mr Sunak said he had filed US tax returns while he held his green card ""in full compliance with the law"". Meanwhile, No 10 has rejected newspaper reports that its staff are leaking damaging stories about Mr Sunak to the media. And Prime Minister Boris Johnson told reporters at a Downing Street news conference: ""If there are such briefings, they are not coming from us in No 10, and heaven knows where they are coming from. I think that Rishi is doing an absolutely outstanding job."" A non-dom is a UK resident who declares their permanent home, or domicile, outside of the UK. A domicile is usually the country his or her father considered his permanent home when they were born, or it may be the place overseas where somebody has moved to with no intention of returning. For proof to the tax authority, non-doms have to provide evidence about their background, lifestyle and future intentions, such as where they own property or intend to be buried. Those who have the status must still pay UK tax on UK earnings but do not need to pay UK tax on foreign income. They can give up their non-dom status at any time. Ms Murty has chosen to be domiciled in India via her father, the billionaire Narayana Murty. Read morehere.

"Boris Johnson announced more weapons for Ukraine Boris Johnson has announced Â£100m worth of weapons for Ukraine after the ""unconscionable bombing"" of refugees at a railway station. The prime minister said the UK will send additional military equipment including Starstreak anti-aircraft missiles and 800 anti-tank missiles. It comes after dozens of people died when a crowded railway station in eastern Ukraine was hit by rockets. Vladimir Putin's daughters have also been sanctioned by the UK. Speaking at a Downing Street press conference with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, Mr Johnson warned Russia will not escape punishment after the attack at Kramatorsk station. He said: ""I know that Britain and Germany share exactly the same sense of horror and revulsion at the brutality unleashed including the unconscionable bombing of refugees fleeing their homes this morning. ""It is a war crime indiscriminately to attack civilians, and Russia's war crimes in Ukraine will not go unnoticed or unpunished."" Mr Johnson called the attack at Kramatorsk station ""unconscionable"" Mr Johnson added the UK will send precision munitions ""capable of lingering in the sky until directed to their target"" and more helmets, body armour, and night vision. Defence Secretary Ben Wallace said the UK will also be providing Ukraine with armoured Mastiff vehicles to fight Russia's invasion. Mastiffs are heavily armoured vehicles suitable for road patrols and convoys. The vehicles will be stripped of sensitive equipment and British troops will help with training in a neighbouring country,the Times reported,external. Mr Putin's daughters Maria Vorontsova and Katerina Tikhonova are subject to travel bans and asset freezes Earlier, the Foreign Office announced fresh sanctions on Mr Putin's daughters, Katerina Vladimirovna Tikhonova, 35, and Maria Vladimirovna Vorontsova, 36. They will be subject to travel bans and asset freezes, the government said. Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said the move ensures those benefitting from Mr Putin's rule will ""feel consequences"". Meanwhile, the daughter of Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov, Yekaterina Sergeyevna Vinokurova, 39, has also been sanctioned. It comes after the three women were sanctioned by the United States on Wednesday. Ms Truss said: ""By freezing the assets and limiting the travel of Putin's allies, the UK government is sealing off reservoirs of cash funding the conflict, while also making sure those who have benefited from Putin's rule feel the consequences. ""Oligarchs and other wealthy Russians are amongst those hit hardest by the sanctions, which have drastically limited their access to luxury consumer goods and access to international markets."" The UK government said Â£275bn of Russian foreign currency reserves, representing 60% of its total, have been frozen due to UK and international sanctions. It added the sanctions were having ""deep and damaging consequences for Putin's ability to wage war"". More than 1,200 individuals and businesses have been targeted by the UK, includingChelsea FC owner Roman AbramovichandMr Lavrov's stepdaughter Polina Kovaleva.

"One pregnant Shanghai resident received these vegetables as a food delivery China's President Xi Jinping has praised his country's handling of the Covid pandemic, even as Shanghai reported record case numbers. Speaking at an event marking China's hosting of the Winter Olympics, Mr Xi said some athletes said China deserved a gold medal for its approach. China's zero-Covid policy has come under strain with infections surging and signs of public anger. Shanghai's 25 million residents remain under lockdown. On Friday, the city - China's financial hub - announced a record 21,000 cases. An official said that out of 130,000 infections during the current outbreak, just one person was considered to be in a ""severe condition"". The low numbers of serious cases have led some to ask whether a lockdown is necessary, says BBC China correspondent Stephen McDonell. Shanghai hospital struggles with Covid infections How is China's zero-Covid strategy changing? Omicron vs Zero-Covid: How long can China hold on? In the north-eastern Jilin City, officials there said that the city had reached ""Social Zero Covid"" after 33 days of lockdown. But residents there have been given no indication when restrictions will be lifted. China is one of the last remaining nations still committed to eradicating Covid, in contrast to most of the world which is trying to live with the virus in its Omicron variation. Shanghai residents have taken to social media to complain about food supplies. People in the city are confined to their homes, and most have to order in food and water and wait for government drop-offs of vegetables, meat and eggs. Food distribution systems are under severe strain But the lockdown extension has overwhelmed delivery services, grocery shop websites and even the distribution of government supplies. Political scientist Dali Yang of the University of Chicago suggested several million people in Shanghaiwere running low on supplies,externaland many were restricted to eating one meal a day. He warned that elderly Shanghainese, who were more likely to live alone and less likely to use smartphones, were among those most at risk. Meanwhile, a video showing a worker in a hazmat costume beating a dog to death with a shovel has caused revulsion online. The dog's owner had reportedly been taken to quarantine after testing positive for Covid and had left the pet outside in the hope that it would survive. The city of 25 million remains under lockdown In his speech, Mr Xi said China's zero Covid policy had withstood the test of the Winter Olympics. There is little sign of China changing its approach.An editorial in state news agency Xinhua said the country would ""firmly adhere"" to its policy.,external ""It will not be long before Chinese citizens affected by the virus can enjoy warm sunshine in spring days as things get back to normal,"" it said.

"The Duchess and Duke of York have been named in this financial dispute The latest steps in a Turkish millionaire's fraud claim have linked a further payment to the Duchess of York. Court documents show lawyers of Nebahat Isbilen have updated who they claim received her assets, in allegations against business adviser Selman Turk. This suggests the Duchess of York could have received a further Â£20,000, in addition to Â£225,000 and more than Â£1m paid to her ex-husband Prince Andrew. Mr Turk has denied the allegations of misusing Mrs Isbilen's money. There are no suggestions of wrongdoing against the Duke or Duchess of York or their family. This complex case before the High Court in London revolves around claims that 77-year-old Mrs Isbilen has been the victim of ""systematic fraud"". She has accused Mr Turk of having ""dishonestly misappropriated"" about Â£38m of her assets. Princess Beatrice 'wedding gift' claim in court case Prince Andrew pays back cash in financial dispute Peters and Peters, the law firm representing Mrs Isbilen, have updated details of where they claim some of her money was directed by Mr Turk, clarifying a confusion over similarly-named businesses. Court papers say it now ""appears likely"" that a payment, previously identified as Â£20,000, was to a business ""connected with Sarah, Duchess of York"". A source close to the duchess said the Â£20,000 was for her advisory role with Alphabet Capital, the firm which had made the payment. Alphabet Capital is claimed in court papers as being used by Mr Turk to make payments - but a source close to the duchess said she was unaware of any link with Mr Turk. Court papers also show Alphabet Capital as the route for the duchess receiving Â£225,000. Prince Andrew has returned Â£750,000 It is understood the Duchess of York is not planning to repay the Â£225,000, because this was to cover her work as a brand ambassador for a US solar energy company. The duchess is understood to have wanted to be paid in a single payment by the US firm, rather than in instalments - and Mr Turk stepped in to forward the full amount. A spokesman for the Duchess of York said: ""The duchess was completely unaware of the allegations that have since emerged against Mr Turk. She is naturally concerned by what has been alleged against him."" Court documents also show claims of payments to her daughter Princess Eugenie, with about Â£15,000 referenced as a ""birthday gift"", and another payment of Â£10,000. Prince Andrew is claimed to have received Â£350,000 through Alphabet Capital. And he has repaid a separate payment of Â£750,000 given to him directly by Mrs Isbilen on 15 November 2019. Princess Beatrice was named in the financial court case Mrs Isbilen says she was misled into believing the Â£750,000 was for help with a passport. She also claims Mr Turk had explained the payment to her bank as a ""wedding gift"" for Princess Beatrice. But Mr Turk says the money for Prince Andrew was paid by Mrs Isbilen ""on her own initiative"" and not under his direction. Mrs Isbilen's lawyer Jonathan Tickner said Prince Andrew was contacted in March 2021 requesting an account of his dealings with Mr Turk. ""Prince Andrew declined to provide any such account but ...repaid Mrs Isbilen the sum of Â£750,000,"" said Mr Tickner. Prince Andrew's representatives have declined to comment on the ongoing court case. The week before the Â£750,000 was paid, Mr Turk's bank business, Heyman AI, had received an award at the Pitch at the Palace business event, headed by Prince Andrew, with Mr Turk and the prince appearing on stage at the awards. The court papers report Mrs Isbilen's claim that Mr Turk also attended a charity event that week hosted by Prince Andrew at St James's Palace, at which Mr Turk ""sought to promote his UK banking business"". But this prize-winning business also seems to have been funded by Mrs Isbilen, who says her assets were being used ""without my knowledge or consent"". She claims millions were taken from her accounts and transferred via other companies, including an offshore firm linked to Mr Turk, to pay for Heyman AI. But Mr Turk says Mrs Isbilen voluntarily offered to support his Heyman AI business, offering him a loan of Â£4m at 0% interest, although he says he convinced her to accept some interest. The business went into liquidation and court papers note that ""all of the money appears to have been spent"". Mrs Isbilen is from a wealthy Turkish business family, but when her politician husband was jailed she wanted help moving her assets out of Turkey. The claim before the High Court is that Mr Turk misused his role as business adviser, with her lawyers saying she had a limited grasp of English and had entrusted ""almost total control"" of her finances to Mr Turk. But Mr Turk rejects any claim of deceit, saying that ""at every step"" he acted in accordance with Mrs Isbilen's instructions. He says she gave her approval to all the financial transactions and investments he carried out, which had been signed by her ""confirming her instructions and authorisation"".

"Yuliia, left, and her mother Tatiana, described how bodies lay in the streets of Mariupol Civilians who have managed to flee Mariupol in recent days have described the increasingly desperate situation inside the besieged city, including accounts of bodies buried in shallow graves, looting by Chechen fighters, and starving residents being killed when they venture out of shelters to find water. The evacuees' accounts are emerging as they reach the town of Zaporizhzhia which is acting as a hub for refugees. They have risked journeys through Russian and Ukrainian lines that the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) describes as an evacuation ""from hell"". Waiting inside one aid facility was Yuliia, with her two daughters and her mother Tatiana. They finally managed to escape the city on Monday. ""There are starving people,"" said Yuliia, who spoke to the BBC on condition that her surname was not used, a frequent request from residents still concerned about their safety. ""People are having mental breakdowns. There is a woman we knew who hanged herself. People are being buried in the streets."" Her mother Tatiana said:  ""[There are] shallow graves, half a metre deep at best, with some earth on top. Dead bodies, all over the streets."" They said many of those with no choice but to remain in basements or wrecked apartment buildings are ""the incapacitated"" - a reference to elderly and disabled people. ""People were starvingâ¦ There was no re-supply. There was no humanitarian aid whatsoever. We were cooking whatever we could on bonfires. No water, no gas, no electricity, no power,"" said Yuliia. Their family survived underground for a month as Tatiana rationed the only food they had. ""Whatever we had in our fridges [when the invasion began], some porridge and butter, that's it. We were just bringing water from a well 3km away,"" Tatiana said. Many who managed to flee from Mariupol found themselves at aid stations in Zaporizhzhia Her other daughter's family have not been able to leave the city. ""There is no communication. We don't know what's happened to our relatives,"" she said. This week, the UK Ministry of Defence warned that the humanitarian crisis was deepening as fierce fighting continued for control of the city and Russian forces blocked aid. The chances of getting out diminished quickly for many residents, according to the accounts to the BBC. As the full extent of the siege took hold in early March, Russian-made Grad rockets ""destroyed a lot of cars"", said Yuliia. ""When we were in Mariupol, Chechens were looting. They were taking people's gold. It was becoming really dangerous, we heard they were raping women,"" she said. ""I was frightened for my kids and I realised we had to get them out in any way possible"". The BBC cannot independently verify the claims. Chechen militants loyal to Moscow have been fighting in Ukraine since the start of the invasion and are reported to have been heavily involved in the siege of Mariupol. Elsewhere in Zaporizhzhia, aid workers have been finding homes and handing out money for evacuated families. Putin demands Mariupol surrender to end shelling Mariupol's refugees carry wounds of battered city At one refugee staging centre, Liubov, aged 61, was waiting with her son Valerii. She had a picture of their apartment block, eviscerated by shelling or an airstrike. ""On some days [there were] 50 planes, on other days 70. Each carrying two bombs. They were hitting the drama theatre, museums, hotels, apartment buildings. They didn't discriminate at all."" When the water supply stopped, Luibov said people had to choose between nothing to drink or a deadly venture outside. Trips for water are laden with danger; Luibov says one man who did so never came back ""Those people who tried to get water got killed. Some people managed to bring small amounts of water for cooking,"" she said. ""We didn't have any water [for weeks]... A man went to get some, he didn't come back."" She said there were up to 300 people in some shelters. ""Russians would take them out from those shelters, take photos of those people and say, 'we came here to liberate you'. People were crying, scared to say anything back. Scared they might get executed or shot. ""The Russians would say: 'See, these are the tears of joy. People are happy to be free from the fascists'."" In the refugee staging centre, Liubov wept as she displayed the pictures on her phone, returning again and again to Mariupol's nightmare: the need for mass burials of the dead. Why Mariupol is so important to Russia's plan 'Russian soldiers held us as human shields' ""They bombed and destroyed Mariupol central market, so people dug a hole in the ground where they would be bringing bodies,"" she said. ""We were told they would be buried there. But we still don't know if that happened."" Liubov and Valerii managed to escape on 19 March. They reached the city of Melekino, also under Russian control, and were searched at a checkpoint where Valerii said the soldiers made him undress. All the men in the centre reported the same thing. Russian soldiers looking for fighters strip them to their underwear searching for tattoos or rifle butt marks on men's shoulders. Mariupol lies in ruins, as seen in this photo of a local resident on 4 April On Wednesday, eight buses carrying evacuees were escorted by the ICRC into Zaporizhzhia. The arrivals had all the belongings they could carry. They looked exhausted and shell-shocked. Some said the communication collapse in Mariupol is so bad they spent weeks not knowing whether the rest of the country had fallen to the Russians. One of the first off the buses was Anna. She had made her own way to the town of Berdyansk about 50 miles (80km) away, the closest the ICRC buses could get to Mariupol. ""Mariupol is a graveyard now. All the neighbourhoods are covered in the graves of civilians,"" she said. ""It was terrifying. People were sourcing water from a well."" ""Unfortunately, not everybody got out. We have relatives in Mariupol who we haven't had communications with since the end of February. We don't know if they are alive or not,"" she added. Anna described her city as a ""graveyard"" Moscow claims it has evacuated civilians held by ""Nazi battalion fighters"" in Mariupol. Ukraine says up to 40,000 people have been forcibly deported to Russia, with some held in ""filtration camps"" where they are investigated. Many people have lost contact with close relatives and have no way of knowing whether they have survived. Yevhenii Lysenko was also waiting at a refugee centre in Zaporizhzhia. He left Mariupol for a work trip before the war started. The invasion happened the day he was due to return home.

""The message [from her] was we're being bombed,"" he said. He scrolled through pages of text messages to his wife, asking where she was, whether she was safe. ""Last time I talked to her was 2 March. So for over a month I haven't spoken to her. I don't know what happened to her. I don't know whether she's alive."" He had considered trying to make a trip to Mariupol, back across Russian lines. ""[But] if I get caught by the separatists they're going to hand me a rifle and tell me to go and shoot my own peopleâ¦ or execute me if I refuse to do that,"" he said. I asked what he knows about his home. He replied: ""It doesn't exist anymore, it's been destroyed by shelling or an airstrike. So essentially there is nowhere for me to return to.""

"Mother clutches a portrait of her soldier son At least 50 people, including women and children, have been killed when rockets hit a train station in the eastern Ukrainian city of Kramatorsk, where thousands were preparing to flee ahead of an expected major Russian offensive. Ukraine accused Russia of deliberately targeting civilians, but Russia denied it was behind the attack - instead saying that Kyiv was responsible. US President Joe Biden - like a number of other Western leaders - put the blame squarely on Russia, accusing it of committing a ""horrific atrocity"". Meanwhile, the UK said it was sending more anti-aircraft and anti-tank missiles to Ukraine. And Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European Commission, visited the town ofBucha, near Kyiv, where bodies of civilians were found lying in the streets after Russia's withdrawal.""We have seen the cruel face of Putin's army,"" she said. Let's start this summary with that attack at Kramatorsk. This video can not be played WATCH: Burnt-out cars and remains of a missile outside Kramatorsk station The railway station was hit at about 10:30 local time (07:30 GMT) on Friday, Kramatorsk Mayor Oleksandr Honcharenko told the BBC. He added this happened as the crowds were ""waiting for the first train"" to be evacuated to safer regions in central and western Ukraine. Oleksandr Kamyshyn, who heads Ukraine's Ukrzaliznytsia state railway company, said two rockets struck the area. Meanwhile, Nathan Mook, an aid worker who saw people crowding at the station, counted between five and 10 explosions: ""Two minutes after we had driven by, you feel it before you hear it: the boom, the explosion."" Ukraine's prosecutor general's office later said that nearly 4,000 people - mainly women and children - were at the station at the time. Both Ukraine and Russia saidTochka-U missiles - which are known to be extremely inaccurate - were used. On Day 44 of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the BBC's Jeremy Bowen took stock of the key battlefield events so far. Ukrainian soldiers mourn at a military funeral Predictions at the start of a quick Russian victory have been upended by the Ukrainians' willingness to fight, he says, but the war is settling into a long struggle that could still endanger the wider world. It is ironic that one of Russia President Vladimir Putin's arguments for Ukraine to be in Russia's orbit is that it is not a proper country. His own actions, along with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky's well-judged messages as he leads a remarkable feat of mobilisation, are sharpening the national identity of Ukrainians. Russia suffered a serious defeat around Kyiv and had to pull back. But it has not lost the war, and is grinding out territorial gains in the east and south. Read Jeremy's article in full here Civilians who have managed to flee Mariupol in recent days have described to the BBC's Tom Bateman the increasingly desperate situation inside the besieged city, including accounts of bodies buried in shallow graves, looting by Chechen fighters, and starving residents being killed when they ventured out of shelters to find water. The evacuees' accounts are emerging as they reach the town of Zaporizhzhia, which is acting as a hub for refugees.

Yuliia, seen here on the left with her mother Tatiana, said people were being buried in the streets of Mariupol Waiting inside one aid facility was Yuliia, her two daughters and her mother Tatiana. They finally managed to escape the city on Monday. ""There are starving people,"" said Yuliia, who spoke to the BBC on condition that her surname was not used, a frequent request from residents still concerned about their safety. ""People are having mental breakdowns. There is a woman we knew who hanged herself. People are being buried in the streets."" Read evacuees' harrowing accounts in full here Ukraine is usually a major producer of cereals such as maize and wheat The Ukraine war led to a ""giant leap"" in food prices last month to another record high, the UN says. The war has cut off supplies from the world's biggest exporter of sunflower oil - which means the costs of alternatives have also climbed. Ukraine is also a major producer of cereals such as maize and wheat, which have risen sharply in price, too. The UN said ""war in the Black Sea region spread shocks through markets for staple grains and vegetable oils"". The UN Food Prices Index tracks the world's most-traded food commodities measuring the average prices of cereal, vegetable oil, dairy, meat, and sugar. Food prices are at their highest since records began 60 years agoaccording to the index, which jumped nearly 13% in March, following February's record high. Pink Floyd have reunited to record their first new material in 28 years - a protest song against the Ukraine war. Hey Hey, Rise Up! features David Gilmour and Nick Mason alongside long-time Floyd bassist Guy Pratt and Nitin Sawhney on keyboards.

"Mykola was forced into a school basement with dozens of others taken from their homes at gunpoint On the white, damp wall of the Yahidne school basement is a crude calendar, drawn in red crayon. It marks a period of unimaginable trauma - from 5 March to 2 April - for the people of this village. Yahidne, 140km (80 miles) north of Kyiv and just outside the city of Chernihiv which is close to the borders with Belarus and Russia, was occupied by Russian soldiers for nearly a month. When they entered, they took men, women and children from their homes at gunpoint and held them in the basement of the local school for four weeks - around 130 people cramped into a room roughly 65 sq m (700 sq ft) in size. Sixty-year-old Mykola Klymchuk was one of them. He offered to show us the basement. As we climbed down a short flight of stairs, we began to smell the stench of disease and decay. The room was dirty - some mattresses, clothes, shoes and books were strewn on the floor, there were four small cots in the centre and a stash of utensils in one corner. Mykola took us straight to the far end of the room. ""This was my half a metre of space. I was sleeping standing up,"" he said. His voice choked up and he started crying. ""I tied myself to the railing here with my scarf so I wouldn't fall over. I spent 25 nights like this."" This video can not be played Watch: Mykola tied himself to a wall so he could sleep standing up Mykola said you couldn't move at all for fear of stepping on people. About 40 or 50 children were among those held captive, including babies. The youngest was just two months old. Russian forces were quick to reach villages such as Yahidne as they launched their assault on Chernihiv. For weeks the city of about 300,000 people was cut off as Russian forces surrounded and bombed it, having met resistance. They also destroyed a bridge on the road to the capital Kyiv, leaving residents with nowhere to flee. Now the Russians have withdrawn following their failure to take Kyiv. The BBC is one of the first news organisations to reach the area and the horror of what happened under both occupation and bombardment can be revealed. So close to the border, people worry too that the Russians could soon return. About 130 people spent four weeks here Fifteen-year-old Anastasiia was in the Yahidne basement along with her father and grandmother. ""There was barely any room. We were living sitting up. We were sleeping sitting up. Not that we slept at all. It was impossible. So many shells were landing around here. It was unbearable,"" she said. The room had no ventilation. Its two windows were boarded up. ""During my time here, 12 people died,"" Mykola said. Most of them were elderly people. It's unclear what they died of, but Mykola believes some suffocated to death. When people died, the bodies couldn't immediately be removed. Russian soldiers would not allow it every day. And because of the constant fighting outside - mortar shelling, explosions and gunfire - it was dangerous as well. This meant that people, including children, lived amidst corpses for hours, and sometimes days, until they could be taken outside. Anastasiia is scared and clearly suffering from the stress of weeks under siege ""It was very scary. I knew the people who died,"" says Anastasiia. ""They treated us very kindly. I felt so sad, they just died here for no reason."" ""In normal conditions, they would not have died. Putin is a war criminal,"" said Mykola. ""My feet had begun to swell up. But I kept thinking to myself, I have to survive. I have to, for my daughter and two granddaughters."" Most of the time people were not allowed to go out even to use a toilet. They were made to use buckets instead. ""Sometimes the soldiers took people out to use them as shields,"" Mykola said. They were allowed to cook on open fires outside twice a day. The village had enough food stocks and a well for water. One of the Russian soldiers told Mykola they had been told they would be in Ukraine for just four days, which would be enough to take over Kyiv. On 3 April, the Russians withdrew from Yahidne. Ukrainian soldiers are now in the village, and most of those who were trapped have been evacuated to areas nearby. ""I wake up many times every night. I feel like I can hear the sound of shooting. I run to my parents, scared,"" says Anastasiia. The Russians occupied villages like Yahidne around Chernihiv in a bid to lay siege to the city and eventually take control of it. They weren't able to enter the city, but there's been extensive destruction to many parts of it and officials say around 350 civilians have been killed. Air strikes destroyed Chernihiv apartment blocks Since Russia's withdrawal from around Chernihiv, volunteers have been burying the dead. One part of the local graveyard is now entirely full of fresh graves, with a placard stuck in each, for the purpose of identification. Families who have been separated have been coming to see if they can find the grave of their loved ones. A local football stadium was bombed, Ukrainian officials say by Russian aircraft. A giant crater can be seen in the centre of the field where one bomb fell. Another destroyed a part of the stands, now a mangled mess of broken plastic seats and metal railings. Next to the stadium, a children's library housed in a historic building has also been badly damaged. As we drove through the city, we passed several residential neighbourhoods which have been almost flattened. Some Chernihiv neighbourhoods have been flattened At Novoselivka, in the north of Chernihiv, destruction is visible as far as the eye can see. Piles of stones and bricks lie where homes must have stood. We saw a child's pink winter jacket, a teddy bear, a stuffed elephant and pieces of Lego on one of the paths going into the residential area. Along the way, we saw more bomb craters. A woman and child on bicycles gestured to us to follow them. Sixty-two-year-old Nina Vynnyk and her grandson, 10-year-old Danylo, wanted to show us their home -  only a shell now, everything in and around it has been destroyed. ""There is nothing left,"" says Nina Nina's daughter and Danylo's mother, 39-year-old Ludmyla, has lost her leg and is in hospital. When Nina's home began to be shelled, they ran to another person's house hoping to seek shelter in their basement. But that was bombed too. ""We were knocked out by the explosion. Someone got a concussion, someone was injured. When we came to our senses, I saw that my daughter was screaming, 'Mummy, mummy I don't have a leg'. It was horrible,"" she said. Ludmyla crawled to safety and was taken to a hospital. ""I feel like this is a terrible nightmare. It can't be true. Why didn't our government warn us? Why didn't they evacuate us,"" said Nina. Four generations of her family lived in the home. ""In one moment, there is nothing left. I don't know where I will live in the winter,"" she said. She can't afford to pay for prosthetics for her daughter. On Russian statements that they have not targeted civilians, she says, ""He [Putin] is full of lies. There is a woman in a hospital without a leg. That is the truth. ""Let Putin pay for her surgery. Let Putin build this house. He wanted it so much, didn't he? Let him pay for all of it now.""

"Chancellor Rishi Sunak's wife Akshata Murty has said she will pay UK taxes on her overseas income, following a row over her non-domicile status. She owns Â£700m in shares of the Indian IT giant Infosys, founded by her father, from which she received Â£11.6m in dividend income last year. As a non-domiciled (non-dom) UK resident she is not required by law to pay UK taxes on her overseas income. But she told the BBC she did not want to be a ""distraction"" for her husband. Her decision to change her tax arrangements follows accusations of hypocrisy against the chancellor, with opposition parties saying Mr Sunak's family is benefiting at a time when the cost of living is going up. The BBC estimates Ms Murty would have avoided Â£2.1m a year in UK tax through her non-dom status. Ms Murty said her tax arrangements had been ""entirely legal"", but added: ""It has become clear that many do not feel it is compatible with my husband's role as chancellor. ""I understand and appreciate the British sense of fairness and I do not wish my tax status to be a distraction for my husband or to affect my family."" Anon-domis someone who lives in the UK but declares their permanent home to be in another country. Sunak held US green card until last year Smearing my wife to get at me is awful, says Sunak Whatever happened to Sunak's political honeymoon? Mr Sunak has accused political opponents of ""smearing"" his wife to get at him. He has also said she is entitled to use the non-dom arrangement as she is an Indian citizen and plans to move back to her home country in the future to care for her parents. Ms Murty will retain her Indian citizenship and her non-dom status which,as the BBC revealed,allows her family to avoid paying inheritance tax in the UK - which at current valuation could amount to Â£280m. On Thursday, it emerged she pays Â£30,000 a year to maintain her non-dom status. In her statement, Ms Murty also said she would now be paying UK tax ""on all my worldwide income, including dividends and capital gains, wherever in the world that income arises"". ""I do this because I want to, not because the rules require me to. These new arrangements will begin immediately and will also be applied to the tax year just finished (2021-22),"" she added. Labour MP Louise Haigh said Mr Sunak had ""not been transparent"". The shadow transport secretary said: ""It is clear that was legal. ""I think the question many people will be asking is whether it was ethical and whether it was right that the Chancellor of the Exchequer, whilst piling on 15 separate tax rises to the British public, was benefiting from a tax scheme that allowed his household to pay significantly less to the tune of potentially tens of millions of pounds."" Lib Dem Treasury spokesperson Christine Jardine called on the Sunak household to backdate the taxes in full, adding: ""Doing something just because you've been found out isn't good enough."" While one former cabinet minister said he had ""mild sympathy"" for Mr Sunak as he had been subjected to a ""nasty ad hominem"" attack, he added that every leadership candidate, declared or otherwise, should expect this. He was naÃ¯ve if he thought families were ""off-limits for attacks"". His view was that the tax row could be as toxic for the chancellor as partygate has been for Mr Johnson. It was all about a disconnect with ordinary voters. They could not hold a children's birthday party during lockdown, but boozy get-togethers were apparently held at the heart of government. Similarly, their taxes were being put up by the chancellor, while his wife did not pay UK tax on some of her own earnings. Read Iain's full analysishere. Speaking to the Sun newspaper, Mr Sunak said it was unfair to attack his wife as she was a ""private citizen"", adding: ""I'm an elected politician. So I know what I signed up for."" It comes on the same day it was revealed thatthe couple retained their rights to live and work in the USby having green cards - which requires holders to consider America their permanent home - for more than a year after Mr Sunak became chancellor in 2020. He returned his green card in October last year, ahead of his first US trip as a UK government minister. Asked about the issue at a White House daily media briefing, press secretary Jen Psaki said it was a matter for other government departments and declined to comment. A spokeswoman for Mr Sunak said he had filed US tax returns while he held his green card ""in full compliance with the law"". Meanwhile, No 10 has rejected newspaper reports that its staff are leaking damaging stories about Mr Sunak to the media. And Prime Minister Boris Johnson told reporters at a Downing Street news conference: ""If there are such briefings, they are not coming from us in No 10, and heaven knows where they are coming from. I think that Rishi is doing an absolutely outstanding job."" A non-dom is a UK resident who declares their permanent home, or domicile, outside of the UK. A domicile is usually the country his or her father considered his permanent home when they were born, or it may be the place overseas where somebody has moved to with no intention of returning. For proof to the tax authority, non-doms have to provide evidence about their background, lifestyle and future intentions, such as where they own property or intend to be buried. Those who have the status must still pay UK tax on UK earnings but do not need to pay UK tax on foreign income. They can give up their non-dom status at any time. Ms Murty has chosen to be domiciled in India via her father, the billionaire Narayana Murty. Read morehere.

"Rishi Sunak has argued it is wrong for people to criticise his wife Akshata Murty Chancellor Rishi Sunak's wife could save herself Â£280m in UK tax thanks to a loophole created by a treaty between the UK and India dating from the 1950s. Akshata Murtyhas ""non-dom"" status, meaning she does not have to pay UK tax on income earned abroad. Non-dom status ""wears off"" after 15 years and the person is subject to all tax requirements of a UK citizen - including on their estate. But there is an exception for Indian citizens around inheritance tax. A technicality means that even if Ms Murty agrees to pay UK taxes on her worldwide income, but retains her non-dom status, she can still benefit from a provision in a 1956 treaty that was designed to stop Indian citizens being double-taxed on their estates in the UK and India. Ms Murty earns money from shares in an Indian software giant founded by her billionaire father. India abolished inheritance tax in the 1980s, but this tax exemption was never revoked. So Ms Murty could have her estate taxed there at zero upon her death,rather than in the UK at 40% - saving Â£280m on her Â£700m stake in the company founded by her father. Like her current reduced tax rate on her worldwide income - this would be perfectly legal, and HMT Treasury has said that the chancellor provided all relevant information on his interests when he became a minister. Smearing my wife to get at me is awful, says Sunak Sunak under pressure over wife's non-dom status Firm part-owned by Sunak's wife closing Russia office Nevertheless, the very significant sums Ms Murty could have saved up to now - and may save in the future - pose some awkward questions for Rishi Sunak. As Chancellor, Rishi Sunak has ultimate oversight of all fiscal matters in the UK. That includes regular reviews of the non-dom rules. Reviewing rules which directly affect the financial arrangements of his own family members seems uncomfortable at best, a direct conflict of interest at worst. Others, including the chancellor's political opponents, have suggested that Mr Sunak should move his power over non-dom policy to another department. On reported dividends of Â£11.5m from Â£700m worth of shares, Ms Murty would have paid tax at 38.1% (39.5% from April 6, 2022) as a UK citizen, which works out as Â£4.4m. As an Indian citizen, the Indian government would tax dividends at 20% (a withholding tax). The UK government would tax the difference between that and the UK rate, or 19.5%. So Ms Murty saves Â£2.1m per year through her ""non-dom"" status. She has also reportedly received income from companies based in Mauritius, which enjoys a more favourable tax treaty with India where the Indian government withholds just 15% of dividend income from Indian companies. It is not known whether Murty holds these shares through a company based in a Mauritius or any other tax haven. Labour party leader Sir Keir Starmer has called for ""full transparency"" from the chancellor over his family's finances. A spokesperson for HM Treasury said: ""The chancellor provided a full list of all relevant interests when he first became a Minister in 2018, as required by the Ministerial Code. ""The Independent Adviser on Ministers' Interests has confirmed that they are completely satisfied with the steps the Chancellor has taken to meet the requirements of the Code."" To be clear, Akshata Murty is not accused of any wrongdoing whatsoever. But someone with preferential tax status living in Number 11 Downing Street does pose uncomfortable questions for the other adult resident. Clarification October 3: This article was edited to reflect the 38.1% tax rate that would have applied in the year to April 2022. This rate rose to 39.5% from April 6.

"Ukraine is usually a major producer of cereals such as maize and wheat The Ukraine war led to a ""giant leap"" in food prices last month to another record high, the United Nations says. The war has cut off supplies from the world's biggest exporter of sunflower oil which means the costs of alternatives have also climbed. Ukraine is also a major producer of cereals such as maize and wheat which have risen sharply in price too. The UN said ""war in the Black Sea region spread shocks through markets for staple grains and vegetable oils"". The UN Food Prices Index tracks the world's most-traded food commodities measuring the average prices of cereal, vegetable oil, dairy, meat, and sugar. Food prices are at their highest since records began 60 years ago according to the index, which jumped nearly 13% in March, following February's record high. The price of vegetable oils soared 23% while cereals were up 17%. Sugar rose 7%, meat was up 5%, while dairy - which has been less affected by the war - only climbed 3%. Food commodity prices were already at 10-year highs before the war in Ukraine according to the index because of global harvest issues. That has fuelled a cost-of-living crisis that is worrying politicians and has sparked warnings of social unrest across the world. In the UK, industry experts have warned that thecost of food could rise by up to 15%this year. The UN's Food and Agricultural Organisation warned last month that food prices could rise by up to 20% as a result of the conflict in Ukraine, raising the risk of increased malnutrition across the world. It has cut its world wheat projection for 2022 from 790 million tonnes to 784 million, because of the possibility that at least 20% of Ukraine's winter crop will not be harvested because of ""direct destruction"". But it said global cereal stocks could end the year 2.4% higher than the start because of stockpiles building up in Russia and Ukraine as both countries exports would shrink.

"The Duchess and Duke of York have been named in this financial dispute The latest steps in a Turkish millionaire's fraud claim have linked a further payment to the Duchess of York. Court documents show lawyers of Nebahat Isbilen have updated who they claim received her assets, in allegations against business adviser Selman Turk. This suggests the Duchess of York could have received a further Â£20,000, in addition to Â£225,000 and more than Â£1m paid to her ex-husband Prince Andrew. Mr Turk has denied the allegations of misusing Mrs Isbilen's money. There are no suggestions of wrongdoing against the Duke or Duchess of York or their family. This complex case before the High Court in London revolves around claims that 77-year-old Mrs Isbilen has been the victim of ""systematic fraud"". She has accused Mr Turk of having ""dishonestly misappropriated"" about Â£38m of her assets. Princess Beatrice 'wedding gift' claim in court case Prince Andrew pays back cash in financial dispute Peters and Peters, the law firm representing Mrs Isbilen, have updated details of where they claim some of her money was directed by Mr Turk, clarifying a confusion over similarly-named businesses. Court papers say it now ""appears likely"" that a payment, previously identified as Â£20,000, was to a business ""connected with Sarah, Duchess of York"". A source close to the duchess said the Â£20,000 was for her advisory role with Alphabet Capital, the firm which had made the payment. Alphabet Capital is claimed in court papers as being used by Mr Turk to make payments - but a source close to the duchess said she was unaware of any link with Mr Turk. Court papers also show Alphabet Capital as the route for the duchess receiving Â£225,000. Prince Andrew has returned Â£750,000 It is understood the Duchess of York is not planning to repay the Â£225,000, because this was to cover her work as a brand ambassador for a US solar energy company. The duchess is understood to have wanted to be paid in a single payment by the US firm, rather than in instalments - and Mr Turk stepped in to forward the full amount. A spokesman for the Duchess of York said: ""The duchess was completely unaware of the allegations that have since emerged against Mr Turk. She is naturally concerned by what has been alleged against him."" Court documents also show claims of payments to her daughter Princess Eugenie, with about Â£15,000 referenced as a ""birthday gift"", and another payment of Â£10,000. Prince Andrew is claimed to have received Â£350,000 through Alphabet Capital. And he has repaid a separate payment of Â£750,000 given to him directly by Mrs Isbilen on 15 November 2019. Princess Beatrice was named in the financial court case Mrs Isbilen says she was misled into believing the Â£750,000 was for help with a passport. She also claims Mr Turk had explained the payment to her bank as a ""wedding gift"" for Princess Beatrice. But Mr Turk says the money for Prince Andrew was paid by Mrs Isbilen ""on her own initiative"" and not under his direction. Mrs Isbilen's lawyer Jonathan Tickner said Prince Andrew was contacted in March 2021 requesting an account of his dealings with Mr Turk. ""Prince Andrew declined to provide any such account but ...repaid Mrs Isbilen the sum of Â£750,000,"" said Mr Tickner. Prince Andrew's representatives have declined to comment on the ongoing court case. The week before the Â£750,000 was paid, Mr Turk's bank business, Heyman AI, had received an award at the Pitch at the Palace business event, headed by Prince Andrew, with Mr Turk and the prince appearing on stage at the awards. The court papers report Mrs Isbilen's claim that Mr Turk also attended a charity event that week hosted by Prince Andrew at St James's Palace, at which Mr Turk ""sought to promote his UK banking business"". But this prize-winning business also seems to have been funded by Mrs Isbilen, who says her assets were being used ""without my knowledge or consent"". She claims millions were taken from her accounts and transferred via other companies, including an offshore firm linked to Mr Turk, to pay for Heyman AI. But Mr Turk says Mrs Isbilen voluntarily offered to support his Heyman AI business, offering him a loan of Â£4m at 0% interest, although he says he convinced her to accept some interest. The business went into liquidation and court papers note that ""all of the money appears to have been spent"". Mrs Isbilen is from a wealthy Turkish business family, but when her politician husband was jailed she wanted help moving her assets out of Turkey. The claim before the High Court is that Mr Turk misused his role as business adviser, with her lawyers saying she had a limited grasp of English and had entrusted ""almost total control"" of her finances to Mr Turk. But Mr Turk rejects any claim of deceit, saying that ""at every step"" he acted in accordance with Mrs Isbilen's instructions. He says she gave her approval to all the financial transactions and investments he carried out, which had been signed by her ""confirming her instructions and authorisation"".

"Rishi Sunak has defended his wife's tax affairs, calling reports on her non-domicile status ""unpleasant smears"". Akshata Murty opted to claim non-dom status, meaning she does not have to pay UK tax on her overseas income. The BBC estimates she would have avoided Â£2.1m a year in UK tax. The non-dom scheme is legal but Labour says it would be ""breathtaking hypocrisy"" if the chancellor's wife had reduced her tax bill as he raised taxes for millions of workers. In an interview with the Sun newspaper,external, Mr Sunak said he believed he was the victim of a campaign to discredit him, saying: ""To smear my wife to get at me is awful."" No 10 has rejected newspaper reports that its staff are leaking damaging material about the chancellor to the media. And Prime Minister Boris Johnson, holding a joint Downing Street press conference with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, said: ""If there are such briefings, they are not coming from us in No 10, and heaven knows where they are coming from. I think that Rishi is doing an absolutely outstanding job."" Chancellor's wife could save Â£280m in UK tax I know how Will Smith felt at Oscars, says Sunak National Insurance rise starts to hit pay packets Ms Murty, an Indian citizen, owns a 0.9% stake in Infosys, the software giant founded by her billionaire father. Her stake fluctuates in value but is estimated to be worth more than Â£500m. She receives annual dividend payments on the shares, which last year werereported to be worth Â£11.6m,external. On Thursday, it emerged that Ms Murty pays Â£30,000 a year to maintain her non-domicile status, meaning she does not pay tax in the UK on her overseas earnings. Under the rules, people can be granted non-dom status if they live in the UK but intend to return home. This is the government form people use to apply for non-dom status Mr Sunak insisted his wife had not broken any rules, telling the Sun: ""Every single penny she earns in the UK she pays UK taxes on... and every penny that she earns internationally, for example in India, she would pay the full taxes on that,"" he said. He said it was unfair to attack his wife when she was a ""private citizen"", adding: ""I'm an elected politician. So I know what I signed up for."" Mr Sunak said his wife was domiciled in India and would eventually return there to care for her parents as they got older. Labour has written to the chancellor to ask if his wife paid all foreign tax in India or in a tax haven such as the Cayman Islands. The party has also asked the chancellor if he benefits from his wife's tax arrangements. The Liberal Democrats have urged Mr Sunak to ban the partners of ministers from claiming non-dom status, calling it a ""loophole"". As the owner of a 0.93% stake - thought to be worth around Â£700m - in her father's company, Askshata Murty would receive Â£11.5m in annual dividends from her investment. The UK normally taxes such dividends at 39.5%, but because Infosys has its headquarters in India and Ms Murty herself is an Indian citizen, the Indian government would levy a 20% tax of its own. As you can't be double taxed, that would leave HM Treasury with the right to demand a remaining 19.5%, or Â£2.1m a year. Ms Murty has had shares in the company since at least 2015 and so may have avoided Â£15m in UK taxes. Non-dom status expires after 15 years, but thanks to a treaty signed between the UK and India in the 1950s, Indian citizens can still be considered non- domiciled when it comes to inheritance tax, levied on someone's estate. The treaty stopped Indians from being double-taxed when they died. In the 1980s, India abolished inheritance tax, but this treaty was never changed. This means Ms Murty can expect to pay no inheritance tax at all on her father's multi-billion-pound fortune. Meanwhile, the Treasury has not denied suggestions that Mr Sunak used to hold a US green card, allowing people to live and work permanently in that country. It has been reported he had a green card - the holder of which must pay US tax on their worldwide income - when he joined the government in 2017 and did not relinquish it until after he became chancellor in 2020. A Treasury source would not say when Mr Sunak gave up his card. The chancellor graduated from Oxford University in 2001 and then worked for investment bank Goldman Sachs until 2004. After that, he studied for a master of business administration (MBA) post-graduate degree at Stanford University, California, from 2004 to 2006, where met fellow student Ms Murty. The couple married in 2009 and have two daughters. A non-dom is a UK resident who declares their permanent home, or domicile, outside of the UK. A domicile is usually the country his or her father considered his permanent home when they were born, or it may be the place overseas where somebody has moved to with no intention of returning. For proof to the tax authority, non-doms have to provide evidence about their background, lifestyle and future intentions, such as where they own property or intend to be buried. Those who have the status must still pay UK tax on UK earnings but do not need to pay UK tax on foreign income. They can give up their non-dom status at any time by stating on a tax return that they intend to live in the UK and wish to be considered British for tax purposes. Ms Murty has chosen to be domiciled in India via her father, the billionaire Narayana Murty, which means she doesn't need to pay taxes in the UK on dividends she receives from her stake in his company.

"Boris Johnson announced more weapons for Ukraine Boris Johnson has announced Â£100m worth of weapons for Ukraine after the ""unconscionable bombing"" of refugees at a railway station. The prime minister said the UK will send additional military equipment including Starstreak anti-aircraft missiles and 800 anti-tank missiles. It comes after dozens of people died when a crowded railway station in eastern Ukraine was hit by rockets. Vladimir Putin's daughters have also been sanctioned by the UK. Speaking at a Downing Street press conference with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, Mr Johnson warned Russia will not escape punishment after the attack at Kramatorsk station. He said: ""I know that Britain and Germany share exactly the same sense of horror and revulsion at the brutality unleashed including the unconscionable bombing of refugees fleeing their homes this morning.

"Passengers queue for security screening in the departures area of Terminal 2 at Manchester Airport in Manchester The UK's aviation watchdog has written to airports and airlines to express concern over the impact of staff shortages on international travel. Thousands of people heading abroad in the run-up to Easter, some of them for the first time in two years, have faced long queues, delays and cancellations. The Civil Aviation Authority said late-notice cancellations and ""excessive"" delays could hit consumer confidence. Airports blame recruitment issues and Covid-linked absences for the delays. Staff sickness caused by coronavirus has seen airlines including EasyJet and British Airways axe dozens of flights, while the aviation industry has struggled to recruit quickly enough after making staff redundant earlier in the pandemic. Ken O'Toole, deputy chief executive at Manchester Airports Group, said: ""The speed and the scale of recovery has caught us and it has meant we are short-staffed at the moment."" Manchester Airport has seen some of the worst disruption, with passengers describing scenes of ""chaos"" after several missed their flights, and warnings that emergency services staff could be drafted in to help tackle the problems. The airport's managing director, Karen Smart, announced she would stand down following criticism of the long security queues. Travellers at Manchester Airport have faced long queues for check-in and security over the past month But in aletter,external, Richard Moriarty, chief executive of the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA), warned late notice cancellations and ""excessive"" delays at airports were not only distressing for consumers but could affect confidence just when passengers were returning to flying. He said that while firms had been working hard to recruit staff ahead of the rush for spring and summer holidays, it was clear this had not always happened fast enough to cope with the increased passenger travel. Mr Moriarty stressed it was important airlines were fixing their schedules in a way that was deliverable given their available staff, with contingencies for staff sickness including from coronavirus. ""Where capacity is unavoidably restricted"", he said, planning was needed to identify problems early so pre-emptive cancellations could be made. ""At at a minimum"" passengers should be given notice so that they do not travel to airports unnecessarily, he added. The CAA boss also reminded airlines that they were legally required to inform passengers of their rights when flights were disrupted, to provide care and assistance during the disruption and to offer a choice of refund or alternative travel. What's causing flight disruption this Easter? Airport boss warns queues could continue for weeks Rail delays and cancellations for Easter travellers A group of schoolchildren told the BBC how upsetting it was for their EasyJet flight from Gatwick to be cancelled, preventing them from joining their classmates on a skiing trip. ""It's really sad, because we had to get up really, really early in the morning for absolutely nothing, just to sit in the airport for about six hours, sitting next to our suitcases looking forward to something that wasn't going to happen,"" one of the girls said. EasyJet apologised and offered further assistance, including a refund. Some schools have already broken up for Easter - the first school holiday since the end of the pandemic travel restrictions - and that has fuelled the rise in demand for foreign trips. Stansted Airport said it is expecting 240,000 travellers this Easter weekend, compared with 8,000 this time last year. There are also warnings of delays over Easter for other modes of travel: Rail passengers facedisruption due to 530 engineering projects over Easter, including the closure of the West Coast Main line between London Euston and Milton Keynes The AA has warned of ""significant congestion"" on the roads during the Easter weekend, as 13.6 million people are expected to try to travel by car on Good Friday alone Ferry operator DFDS says this weekend it will not be able to accept passengers on cancelled P&O services following the mass sacking of staff, as it anticipates a 50% rise in its own passengers amidongoing disruption at Dover In addition to recruitment issues, the Airport Operators Association (AOA), which represents most UK airports, said Covid documentation checks and customers being unfamiliar with airport processes were also contributing to the delays and longer queues. Abta, a trade association for tour operators and travel agents, said in a statement its members had reported bookings for this year were approaching 2019 levels.

"Dmitry Peskov said Russia's troop losses were a ""huge tragedy"" Russia has admitted suffering ""significant losses of troops"" in Ukraine, as the invasion enters its 44th day. Presidential spokesman Dmitry Peskov told British channel Sky News the casualties were ""a huge tragedy for us"". He said he hoped Moscow would reach its war goals ""in the coming days"". Mr Peskov's comments followed Russia's expulsion from the United Nations Human Rights council on Wednesday. Some 93 of the 193 members of the UN General Assembly voted in favour of the diplomatic rebuke, which followed allegations of mass human rights abuses by Russian troops in the formerly occupied town of Bucha in northern Ukraine. Moscow announced its resignation from the council in response. The body expressed its ""grave concern at the ongoing human rights and humanitarian crisis"", and Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky accused Russia of further atrocities in Borodyanka, a town near the capital Kyiv. BORODYANKA: 'There are a lot of people left under the rubble' DONBAS: Why Russia is trying to encircle Ukraine's east Mr Peskov denied any suggestion that Russian troops were responsible for executions in the town of Bucha and told the broadcaster that ""we're living in days of fakes and lies"". He baselessly claimed that images of civilians murdered in the town were staged. However, his admission that Russia has suffered significant casualties is striking. On 25 March, Russia's Ministry of Defence said 1,351 of its soldiers had been killed in combat. Ukraine puts the Russian deaths at almost 19,000. Neither Russia nor Ukraine's estimates of Russian losses can be independently verified - and analysts have cautioned that Russia may be downplaying its casualty rate, while Ukraine could be inflating it to boost morale. Western leaders believe that between 7,000 and 15,000 Russian soldiers have been killed. The remnants of a Russian tank are cleared away near Kyiv Mr Peskov, who has served as Russian President Vladimir Putin's spokesperson since 2000, also claimed that Russia is searching for ways to end the war. ""Our military are doing their best to bring an end to that operation,"" he said. ""And we do hope that in coming days, in the foreseeable future, this operation will reach its goals or will finish it by the negotiations between Russian and Ukrainian delegation."" Russia has pulled troops away from Kyiv and shifted most of the focus of its war to eastern Ukraine - but the fighting shows no signs of ending. Ukraine's deputy prime minister hasurged Ukrainians living in the east to flee while they still can, and the intensity of the shelling there is already hampering evacuations. On Thursday, Western nations imposed further sanctions on the Russian economy in retaliation for alleged war crimes in Ukraine. The US Senate voted unanimously to remove Moscow's ""most favoured nation"" trade status, opening the door to damaging new tariffs and import controls on products like platinum, chemicals, iron and steel. And the EU agreed to gradually impose a ban on imports of Russian coal, worth around $4bn (Â£3.3bn) a year to the Russian economy, over the next 120 days. Speaking to Russia's parliament, the state Duma, Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin admitted that the cumulative impact of extensive sanctions means the country is facing its worst economic outlook in decades. ""No doubt, the current situation could be called the most difficult in three decades for Russia,"" he said. ""Such sanctions were not used even in the darkest times of the Cold War."" But he claimed that the impact of Western sanctions has been limited, telling MPs that the ""financial system, the lifeblood of the entire economy, has held up"". After collapsing to a historic low at the end of February, Russia's currency the rouble has rebounded to its pre-war level. Ukraine's President Zelensky has renewed his calls for fresh supplies of heavy weapons from the West, saying his forces need ""weapons which will give it the means to win on the battlefield and that will be the strongest possible sanction against Russia"".

"Rishi Sunak has defended his wife's tax affairs, calling reports on her non-domicile status ""unpleasant smears"". Akshata Murty opted to claim non-dom status, meaning she does not have to pay UK tax on her overseas income. The BBC estimates she would have avoided Â£2.1m a year in UK tax. The non-dom scheme is legal but Labour says it would be ""breathtaking hypocrisy"" if the chancellor's wife had reduced her tax bill as he raised taxes for millions of workers. In an interview with the Sun newspaper,external, Mr Sunak said he believed he was the victim of a campaign to discredit him, saying: ""To smear my wife to get at me is awful."" No 10 has rejected newspaper reports that its staff are leaking damaging material about the chancellor to the media. And Prime Minister Boris Johnson, holding a joint Downing Street press conference with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, said: ""If there are such briefings, they are not coming from us in No 10, and heaven knows where they are coming from. I think that Rishi is doing an absolutely outstanding job."" Chancellor's wife could save Â£280m in UK tax I know how Will Smith felt at Oscars, says Sunak National Insurance rise starts to hit pay packets Ms Murty, an Indian citizen, owns a 0.9% stake in Infosys, the software giant founded by her billionaire father. Her stake fluctuates in value but is estimated to be worth more than Â£500m. She receives annual dividend payments on the shares, which last year werereported to be worth Â£11.6m,external. On Thursday, it emerged that Ms Murty pays Â£30,000 a year to maintain her non-domicile status, meaning she does not pay tax in the UK on her overseas earnings. Under the rules, people can be granted non-dom status if they live in the UK but intend to return home. This is the government form people use to apply for non-dom status Mr Sunak insisted his wife had not broken any rules, telling the Sun: ""Every single penny she earns in the UK she pays UK taxes on... and every penny that she earns internationally, for example in India, she would pay the full taxes on that,"" he said. He said it was unfair to attack his wife when she was a ""private citizen"", adding: ""I'm an elected politician. So I know what I signed up for."" Mr Sunak said his wife was domiciled in India and would eventually return there to care for her parents as they got older. Labour has written to the chancellor to ask if his wife paid all foreign tax in India or in a tax haven such as the Cayman Islands. The party has also asked the chancellor if he benefits from his wife's tax arrangements. The Liberal Democrats have urged Mr Sunak to ban the partners of ministers from claiming non-dom status, calling it a ""loophole"". As the owner of a 0.93% stake - thought to be worth around Â£700m - in her father's company, Askshata Murty would receive Â£11.5m in annual dividends from her investment. The UK normally taxes such dividends at 39.5%, but because Infosys has its headquarters in India and Ms Murty herself is an Indian citizen, the Indian government would levy a 20% tax of its own. As you can't be double taxed, that would leave HM Treasury with the right to demand a remaining 19.5%, or Â£2.1m a year. Ms Murty has had shares in the company since at least 2015 and so may have avoided Â£15m in UK taxes. Non-dom status expires after 15 years, but thanks to a treaty signed between the UK and India in the 1950s, Indian citizens can still be considered non- domiciled when it comes to inheritance tax, levied on someone's estate. The treaty stopped Indians from being double-taxed when they died. In the 1980s, India abolished inheritance tax, but this treaty was never changed. This means Ms Murty can expect to pay no inheritance tax at all on her father's multi-billion-pound fortune. Meanwhile, the Treasury has not denied suggestions that Mr Sunak used to hold a US green card, allowing people to live and work permanently in that country. It has been reported he had a green card - the holder of which must pay US tax on their worldwide income - when he joined the government in 2017 and did not relinquish it until after he became chancellor in 2020. A Treasury source would not say when Mr Sunak gave up his card. The chancellor graduated from Oxford University in 2001 and then worked for investment bank Goldman Sachs until 2004. After that, he studied for a master of business administration (MBA) post-graduate degree at Stanford University, California, from 2004 to 2006, where met fellow student Ms Murty. The couple married in 2009 and have two daughters. A non-dom is a UK resident who declares their permanent home, or domicile, outside of the UK. A domicile is usually the country his or her father considered his permanent home when they were born, or it may be the place overseas where somebody has moved to with no intention of returning. For proof to the tax authority, non-doms have to provide evidence about their background, lifestyle and future intentions, such as where they own property or intend to be buried. Those who have the status must still pay UK tax on UK earnings but do not need to pay UK tax on foreign income. They can give up their non-dom status at any time by stating on a tax return that they intend to live in the UK and wish to be considered British for tax purposes. Ms Murty has chosen to be domiciled in India via her father, the billionaire Narayana Murty, which means she doesn't need to pay taxes in the UK on dividends she receives from her stake in his company.

"Passengers queue for security screening in the departures area of Terminal 2 at Manchester Airport in Manchester The UK's aviation watchdog has written to airports and airlines to express concern over the impact of staff shortages on international travel. Thousands of people heading abroad in the run-up to Easter, some of them for the first time in two years, have faced long queues, delays and cancellations. The Civil Aviation Authority said late-notice cancellations and ""excessive"" delays could hit consumer confidence. Airports blame recruitment issues and Covid-linked absences for the delays. Staff sickness caused by coronavirus has seen airlines including EasyJet and British Airways axe dozens of flights, while the aviation industry has struggled to recruit quickly enough after making staff redundant earlier in the pandemic. Ken O'Toole, deputy chief executive at Manchester Airports Group, said: ""The speed and the scale of recovery has caught us and it has meant we are short-staffed at the moment."" Manchester Airport has seen some of the worst disruption, with passengers describing scenes of ""chaos"" after several missed their flights, and warnings that emergency services staff could be drafted in to help tackle the problems. The airport's managing director, Karen Smart, announced she would stand down following criticism of the long security queues. Travellers at Manchester Airport have faced long queues for check-in and security over the past month But in aletter,external, Richard Moriarty, chief executive of the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA), warned late notice cancellations and ""excessive"" delays at airports were not only distressing for consumers but could affect confidence just when passengers were returning to flying. He said that while firms had been working hard to recruit staff ahead of the rush for spring and summer holidays, it was clear this had not always happened fast enough to cope with the increased passenger travel. Mr Moriarty stressed it was important airlines were fixing their schedules in a way that was deliverable given their available staff, with contingencies for staff sickness including from coronavirus. ""Where capacity is unavoidably restricted"", he said, planning was needed to identify problems early so pre-emptive cancellations could be made. ""At at a minimum"" passengers should be given notice so that they do not travel to airports unnecessarily, he added. The CAA boss also reminded airlines that they were legally required to inform passengers of their rights when flights were disrupted, to provide care and assistance during the disruption and to offer a choice of refund or alternative travel. What's causing flight disruption this Easter? Airport boss warns queues could continue for weeks Rail delays and cancellations for Easter travellers A group of schoolchildren told the BBC how upsetting it was for their EasyJet flight from Gatwick to be cancelled, preventing them from joining their classmates on a skiing trip. ""It's really sad, because we had to get up really, really early in the morning for absolutely nothing, just to sit in the airport for about six hours, sitting next to our suitcases looking forward to something that wasn't going to happen,"" one of the girls said. EasyJet apologised and offered further assistance, including a refund. Some schools have already broken up for Easter - the first school holiday since the end of the pandemic travel restrictions - and that has fuelled the rise in demand for foreign trips. Stansted Airport said it is expecting 240,000 travellers this Easter weekend, compared with 8,000 this time last year. There are also warnings of delays over Easter for other modes of travel: Rail passengers facedisruption due to 530 engineering projects over Easter, including the closure of the West Coast Main line between London Euston and Milton Keynes The AA has warned of ""significant congestion"" on the roads during the Easter weekend, as 13.6 million people are expected to try to travel by car on Good Friday alone Ferry operator DFDS says this weekend it will not be able to accept passengers on cancelled P&O services following the mass sacking of staff, as it anticipates a 50% rise in its own passengers amidongoing disruption at Dover In addition to recruitment issues, the Airport Operators Association (AOA), which represents most UK airports, said Covid documentation checks and customers being unfamiliar with airport processes were also contributing to the delays and longer queues. Abta, a trade association for tour operators and travel agents, said in a statement its members had reported bookings for this year were approaching 2019 levels. ""Our own research shows an increasing number of people have a foreign holiday booked for the next 12 months, up a third when compared to six months ago,"" it added.
