"This video can not be played Trump calls for an 'orderly transition of power' to the Biden administration on January 20th US President Donald Trump has said he will not attend the inauguration of his successor, Joe Biden, on 20 January. ""To all of those who have asked, I will not be going to the Inauguration on January 20th,"" the president tweeted. The president-elect welcomed the news, calling Mr Trump's absence ""a good thing"". Mr Trump is facing calls for his removal from office after five people died when a mob of his supporters invaded Congress. The president was not fit to serve in the White House, Mr Biden said. But he said he would happy for Vice-President Mike Pence to attend the inauguration. The latest death is that of US Capitol Police officer Brian Sicknick, who succumbed to his injuries in hospital. The FBI and Washington police will jointly investigate his death, although they have not yet said whether it will be treated as murder. Wednesday's violence came hours after Mr Trump encouraged his supporters to fight against the election results as Congress was certifying Mr Biden's victory in the November vote. Under pressure, Mr Trump released a recorded statement late on Thursday condemning the storming of the US Capitol as a ""heinous attack"". It is highly unusual but not unprecedented: the last president to skip the inauguration of his successor was Andrew Johnson, in 1869. Mr Trump has now admitted defeat in the 3 November election and has promised a peaceful transfer of power. However, he has repeated baseless claims of widespread voter fraud. Meanwhile, House Democrats plan to introduce articles of impeachment next Monday accusing the outgoing president of incitement of insurrection. Nearly 160 House Democrats have signed on to the bill, which was drafted by congressmen Ted Lieu of California and David Cicilline of Rhode Island while they were sheltering in place during Wednesday's chaos at the Capitol. If the House votes to pass an impeachment, proceedings would move to the Senate. But there is so far no sign that the two-thirds of votes required to convict the president can be found in the Republican-controlled upper chamber. The White House responded in a statement: ""A politically motivated impeachment against a President with 12 days remaining in his term will only serve to further divide our great country."" House Speaker Nancy Pelosi previously said her preference was for Mr Trump to be removedusing the 25th Amendment, which allows the vice-president to step up if the president is unable to perform his duties owing to a mental or physical illness. But there is no sign of the support from the vice-president and cabinet members needed to trigger this constitutional process. Americans 'shocked' and 'disgusted' by riots A visual guide to the Congress riots The US Air Force veteran who lost her life in riots Time is tight, with just 12 days remaining in Mr Trump's presidential term. On Friday, Mrs Pelosi said she had spoken to the top US military official, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, to prevent Mr Trump from accessing US nuclear codes. Separately, one of Mrs Pelosi's staff members revealed that a laptop had been stolen from her office during the mob invasion of Congress. This video can not be played Phone footage reveals chaotic scenes inside US Capitol Trump's announcement that he will not attend Joe Biden's inauguration, breaking with a long American tradition, should not come as a huge surprise. He only recently, and reluctantly, acknowledged his presidential defeat, after months of unfounded allegations that a landslide electoral victory had been stolen from him. The terse message, posted on Twitter, will undercut the president's call for ""healing and reconciliation"" made in the White House video he released last night. It suggests Trump, far from being at peace with his defeat, still harbours the kind of anger and resentment he has displayed in recent days. He will not graciously welcome the Bidens to Washington as part of his promised ""smooth, orderly and seamless transition of power"". He may not even be anywhere near Washington when they arrive. Instead, scripted Trump and Twitter Trump reveal two very different attitudes. Already, Trump has tweeted about the ""giant voice"" his supporters will continue to have. The question is whether Trump is writing a coda to his presidency or just clearing his throat.

"Democrats are expected to introduce the article of impeachment against President Trump in the House of Representatives on Monday US Democrats plan to introduce an article of impeachment against President Donald Trump for his role in Wednesday's invasion of the US Capitol. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said she would move forward with impeachment if Mr Trump did not resign immediately. The charge of ""incitement of insurrection"" is set to be introduced by House Democrats on Monday. They accuse Mr Trump of encouraging a riot in Congress in which five people died. President-elect Joe Biden said impeachment was for Congress to decide, but said he had thought ""for a long time President Trump was not fit to hold the job"". This video can not be played Voices from Trump land: 'We will continue to be divided' The White House dismissed the impeachment as a ""politically motivated"" move that would ""only serve to further divide our great country"". Nearly 160 House of Representatives Democrats have signed on to the bill, which congressmen Ted Lieu of California and David Cicilline of Rhode Island began drafting while they were sheltering in place during Wednesday's chaos at the Capitol. If the process does go ahead, it would be the second time the House has pursued impeachment against President Trump. In December 2019, the lower chamber impeached Mr Trump on charges of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress. But the Senate acquitted him on both charges in February 2020. Could Trump be removed from power? Trump acquitted by Senate in impeachment trial No US president has ever been impeached twice. However, the prospect of an impeachment conviction seems remote because of Mr Trump's Republican broad support in the Senate. One moderate Republican senator, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, told the Anchorage Daily News on Friday that Trump simply ""needs to get out"". And Republican Senator Ben Sasse of Nebraska, a regular critic of Trump, said he would ""definitely consider"" impeachment. But there is so far no indication that enough members of the president's party would agree to convict him. This video can not be played Capitol riots: âWe would have been murderedâ That means an impeachment in the House might only be a symbolic action to hold Mr Trump accountable for the invasion of Congress. An internal Senate memo says the soonest it could take up any articles of impeachment from the House would be on 19 January, the day before Mr Trump's term expires, and a trial could only begin after he had left office. Constitutional experts are split on whether impeachment can still proceed to a Senate trial in this event. If convicted, Mr Trump would lose benefits granted to former presidents, and senators could vote to bar him permanently from public office. This video can not be played Trump calls for an 'orderly transition of power' to the Biden administration on January 20th The unprecedented move comes as an isolated Mr Trump holed up at the White House on Friday and his main means of communication with the outside world, Twitter, banned him from its platform. The siege of the Capitol has put senior politicians on edge, prompting the Democratic House Speaker Pelosi to talk to the nation's top military officer about ways to prevent Mr Trump from accessing nuclear codes. In a dramatic day in Washington DC on Friday, other developments included: Mr Trump has said he would not attend the inauguration of his successor, Mr Biden, on 20 January The FBI joined an investigation into the death of police officer Brian Sicknick from injuries sustained during the siege of the Capitol Dozens of people were arrested and several charged in relation to the assault on the Capitol building One of Mrs Pelosi's staff members revealed that a laptop was stolen from her office during the mob invasion Democrats and several prominent Republicans reiterated their calls for Mr Trump's cabinet to invoke constitutional powers and remove him from office The draft resolution, which has been shared with BBC partner CBS News, consists of one article: ""incitement of insurrection"". ""Donald John Trump engaged in high Crimes and Misdemeanours by willfully inciting violence against the Government of the United States,"" the draft reads. In the resolution, the lawmakers accuse the president of making statements that encouraged and resulted in ""imminent lawless action at the Capitol"". This video can not be played What does it take to impeach a president? The draft also says this was ""consistent with his prior efforts to subvert and obstruct"" the certification of President-elect Biden's win in November's presidential election. ""He thereby betrayed his trust as President, to the manifest injury of the people of the United States,"" the draft says. The president urged his supporters to march on the Capitol on the day Mr Biden's electoral college victory was to be confirmed by Congress. Americans 'shocked' and 'disgusted' by riots A visual guide to the Congress riots The US Air Force veteran who lost her life in riots He held a rally at which he repeatedly cast doubt on the legitimacy of the presidential election, alleging, without evidence, that it was ""stolen"" from him. ""We're going to walk down to the Capitol and we're going to cheer on our brave senators and Congressmen and women,"" Mr Trump told the crowd, exhorting his supporters ""to fight"". Democrats and some Republicans have argued that these words amounted to incitement. Impeachment allows Congress - the part of the US government that writes and brings in laws - to put presidents on trial. Articles of impeachment are charges brought against a president by the House of Representatives. If the House votes to pass them, proceedings move to the Senate, which decides whether or not to convict. It is a rare event and a political process, rather than a criminal one. This video can not be played The impeachment saga from beginning to end Mr Trump was the third US president to have been impeached. The two others, Bill Clinton in 1999 and Andrew Johnson in 1868, were left in office by the Senate. President Richard Nixon resigned before he could be impeached. On Wednesday, with Washington still reeling from the Capitol riot, Democrats held a conference call in which they talked for three hours about the prospect of removing the president from office. CBS News reports that Democrats were overwhelmingly supportive of the effort, with just one, Oregon Representative Kurt Schrader, arguing that such a move would be too divisive for the country. This video can not be played Phone footage reveals chaotic scenes inside US Capitol Mrs Pelosi told her members that her preference would be to see Mr Trump removed by the 25th Amendment, which allows the vice-president to step up if the president is unable to perform his duties owing to a mental or physical illness. If that did not happen, impeachment would be on the table, she said. US media reports say Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has been personally involved in discussions about invoking the 25th Amendment. However, such a course of action is said to be highly unlikely, and there is no sign that Vice-President Pence is prepared to use the amendment. Five people died after incidents at the riots inside Congress On Friday, Mrs Pelosi called Mr Trump ""unhinged"" and said Congress must do everything possible to protect Americans while he is in office. In a later statement, Ms Pelosi said the House Democratic Caucus had a ""sad, moving and patriotic"" discussion about the possibility of impeachment.

aftermath of Wednesday's events at the US Capitol for now. Thanks for reading. The majority of Americans questioned (57%) said they thought President Donald Trump should be immediately removed from office following events in the Capitol on Wednesday, a Reuters/Ipsos poll suggests. As many as seven out of 10 Trump supporters - those who voted for Trump in November's presidential election - who participated in the national public opinion survey on Thursday and Friday condemned the violence, which led to the deaths of four civilians and a police officer. The poll useda sample of 1,005 Americans aged 18 or over.,externalThe sample included 490 Democrat voters, 363 Republican voters and a number of independent voters. The siege at the Capitol, as US Congress attempted to certify Joe Biden's victory in the presidential election, took place just hours after Trump addressed supporters and told them: ""We will never give up; we will never concede."" Following Wednesdayâs events,
there's been much discussion about whether Trump can be removed
from office, as Democrats are demanding. There are two ways that this
could be done. 25th amendment The 25th
amendment to the constitution allows the vice-president to become acting president when a sitting president
is deemed unable to continue his or her duties. Section four of the
amendment allows the vice-president and a majority of the cabinet to make this determination. Impeachment For a president to be impeached, charges must first be brought to the House and passed in a simple majority vote. It's possible the Democrats could do this next week, making Trump the first president in history to be impeached twice. Proceedings then move to the Senate but it's seen as unlikely that there would be enough time to complete the trial there. Even if this did happen, a two-thirds majority is required to vote for a president's removal, which would involve a lot of Republicans having to support it. We've put together a guide on these processes, if you'd like to read it. The FBI earlier released this image of a suspect wanted in connection with the planting of suspected pipe bombs in Washington The FBI is offering a reward of up to $50,000 (Â£37,000) for information as investigators try to track down those responsible for planting two pipe bombs in Republican and Democratic party headquarters during the attack on the US Capitol. Police received reports of suspected devices on Wednesday. Today, the FBI said in a statement that rewards would be issued on information that leads to ""the location, arrest and conviction"" of suspects. Bomb technicians used water cannon,externalto break the devices apart and render them harmless during the riots in Washington DC, ABC News reported. While rioters in the nation's capital made headlines, Trump supporters rallied at state capitols across America to protest against the election results. In the state of Washington, a crowd marched from the capitol and broke in to the grounds of the governor's mansion. This video can not be played How protests swept across the US In a break with her party, Republican Alaska Senator Lisa Murkowski says it's time for Trump to leave. ""He has caused enough damage,â Murkowskitold the Anchorage Daily News on Friday.,external ""I think he should leave. He said heâs not going to show up. Heâs not going to appear at the inauguration. He hasnât been focused on what is going on with Covid,"" she said. The senator added that Trump has been either golfing or ""fuming and throwing every single person who has been loyal and faithful to him under the bus"" - including Vice-President Mike Pence. ""He only wants to stay there for his ego. He needs to get out. He needs to do the good thing, but I donât think heâs capable of doing a good thing."" When asked about her ties to the Republican Party, Murkowski said: ""If the Republican Party has become nothing more than the party of Trump, I sincerely question whether this is the party for me."" Our North America reporter Anthony Zurcher noted that Murkowski won her senate race as a write-in candidate, and could survive without the Republican Party. A prominent left-wing activist from Utah was among the pro-Trump mob, according to multiple videos from Wednesday's invasion of the Capitol. But John Sullivan, 26, says he was just there to ""document"" it. Sullivan is the founder of Insurgence USA, which calls itself ""a group for racial justice and police reform"". In a series of media appearances after the riot, he defended his involvement, saying it was important for people ""to see the truth"" and ""see it raw"". When air force veteran and Trump supporter Ashli Babbitt was shot inside the building - the first known casualty of the violence - Sullivan and an associate were at close range. They later provided video to the Washington Post. Sullivan - who currently faces two criminal charges that stem from a separate protest in Utah - also spoke to major media outlets, including CNN and Fox News, on Wednesday and Thursday. Following these appearances, he was briefly detained by DC police, but he does not appear to have been arrested and formally charged for his role in the security breach. On the heels of the impeachment news, the White House has responded by saying this is a time for coming together. ""As President Trump said yesterday, this is a time for healing and unity as one nation,"" a White House statement to CNN reads. ""A politically motivated impeachment against a president with 12 days remaining in his term will only serve to further divide our great country."" Here's more on those impending impeachment articles. According to a four-page draft posted by NBC News, the first charge against Trump is ""incitement of insurrection"". ""Donald John Trump engaged in high Crimes and Misdemeanors by willfully inciting violence against the Government of the United States,"" the draft reads. The lawmakers accuse the president of making statements that encouraged and resulted in ""imminent lawless action at the Capitol"". The draft also says this was ""consistent with his prior efforts to subvert and obstruct"" the certification of President-elect Joe Biden's win. ""He thereby betrayed his trust as President, to the manifest injury of the people of the United States."" Three Democrats - Congressmen Ted Lieu, David Cicilline and Jamie Raskin - are planning on introducing articles of impeachment against President Trump on Monday. Articles of impeachment are charges brought against a president by the House of Rperesentatives. If the House votes to pass them, proceedings move to the Senate, which decides whether or not to convict. CBS News, the BBC's US partner, reports that the bill has nearly 160 co-sponsors in the House. The three authors reportedly began drafting it while they were sheltering-in-place during Wednesday's riot. Dozens of people have been taken into custody as the dust settles from Wednesday's violence at the US Capitol. Here are some of the offenders: Congresswoman Mary Miller had called Hitler 'right' A Republican lawmaker who had been in office for less than a week when she invoked German dictator Adolf Hitler in a Washington speech has apologised for saying that she agreed with the mass murderer. Illinois Congresswoman Mary Miller had said in a speech on Tuesday outside the Capitol, one day before her fellow Trump supporters ransacked the building, that Hitler had been ""right"". Miller told the crowd: ""You know, if we win a few elections weâre still going to be losing unless we win the hearts of our children. ""Itâs the battle. Hitler was right on one thing - that whoever has the youth has the future.""  Hitler, among his supporters in Germany in 1933 The comments drew large-scale condemnation, with the US Holocaust Memorial Museum saying in a statement that it ""unequivocally condemns any leader trying to advance a position by claiming Adolf Hitler was âright.â"" Under Hitler, millions of Jews and other minority groups were murdered across Europe by Germany and its allies during World War Two. On Friday, Miller insisted that she is not anti-semitic and accused other of ""trying to intentionally twist my words"". ""I sincerely apologise for any harm my words caused and regret using a reference to one of the most evil dictators in history to illustrate the dangers that outside influences can have on our youth,"" she said. Correction 23rd
June 2022: This post originally described Mary Miller as having praised Hitler
and has been amended to make clear that she invoked Hitler in her speech. Lindsey Graham, a senior Republican member of the US Senate, is the latest target of harassment by Trump supporters in Washington DC. On Wednesday - after an armed mob invaded the US Capitol building - Graham joined other members of Congress in returning to certify the election results. In a speech before his colleagues, he declared Joe Biden to be ""lawfully elected"" and thus ""the legitimate president"". On Friday, a crowd of angry Trump loyalists confronted him in a DC-area airport, labelling him a ""traitor"". ""You don't represent us anymore,"" shouted one, as Graham - surrounded by security - walked away. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

dysfunction, the leadership in Beijing is consolidating power, silencing
 dissent and advancing technologies. China is able to leverage the lack of stability in 
the US to promote two of its arguments. The first one is that democracy 
is messy and potentially violent, which does not make it an ideal political 
model for China. Second, the West is applying a double standard in its behaviour toward China. Foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua 
Chunying drew comparisons between the Washington riots with 
pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong: âSeeing those scenes in the United 
States has brought back a sense of dÃ©jÃ  vu.â She criticised
 western politicians and media for glorifying the Hong Kong protesters 
while condemning those storming into the US Congress. As many have pointed out, despite the superficial 
similarities of the two events, they are fundamentally different. Hong 
Kong activists were demanding a fully democratic election, while the 
Capitol rioters were trying to overturn the result
 of such a vote. But there is little doubt the mayhem in the US
 has reinforced Beijingâs messages and further damaged Washingtonâs 
reputation around the globe. Analysts have labeled the Capitol siege as the day 
when ""the post-American era"" began. Many in and outside of China 
believe the new era will be âthe China centuryâ. If that's so, what would it look like? This is just one among the many
 big questions arising from the extraordinary events in Washington this 
week. Tara McKelveyBBC News, Washington In the wake of Wednesday's assault, dozens of people have been arrested - many for curfew violations - but most of the culprits of the Capitol building break-in remain at large. These intruders could be charged with an array of crimes, ranging from trespassing and other relatively minor ones to serious offences involving firearms and explosive devices. They could be sentenced to many years in prison. Which is why the FBI is now asking: do you recognise anyone in this picture? If so, agents want to hear from you. They want everyone in Washington DC, and across the US, to join their crime-solving team. Read the full story about the FBI's outreach and citizen-sleuthing here. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau began his press conference today by addressing the ""assault on democracy by violent rioters"" that he says was ""incited by the current president and other politicians"". He says that US democracy has shown itself to be ""resilient"" since Wednesday's raid, adding that he has discussed the situation with the premiers of Canada's provinces last night. ""Democracy is not automatic. It takes work every day,"" says the liberal leader who has been forced to bite his tongue on more than a few occasion over the last four years. This video can not be played Justin Trudeau: DC riot was 'assault on democracy' President-elect Biden says there should be a full investigation into the security breakdown at the Capitol. He emphasised that the rioters who broke in were ""thugs"". ""These are a bunch of thugs. They're terrorists, domestic terrorists,"" he said, adding that they should be prosecuted. Biden also said the unfolding of the situation, with the ""active encouragement of a sitting president"", should be investigated. ""The idea that thousands of people could be marching up the steps of the United States Capitol, breaking the windows, breaking doors, forcing their way in... and it looked like you had some of the Capitol police taking selfies with these people. ""That has to be thoroughly investigated, the authorities responsible have to be held accountable for the failures that occurred and we have to make sure that this can never ever happen again."" Biden added: ""This reminded me more of states I've visited...in tin horn dictatorships."" Asked if he believes that law enforcement will be able to secure his inauguration ceremony on 20 January, when he officially takes over the keys to the White House, Biden says he has ""great confidence in the Secret Service"" and the inauguration committee. ""I have confidence in the planning that has been underway before this and continues with the Secret Service,"" he says during his speech from Delaware. When asked how he feels about Trump skipping the inauguration ceremony, Biden calls the decision ""one of the few things he and I agree on,"" adding that is a good thing Trump won't be there. Biden adds that Vice-President Mike Pence - who certified Biden's win on Wednesday after lawmakers retook control of the chamber - is still ""welcome"" to attend. President-elect Joe Biden says he's more focused on addressing the pandemic than impeaching his predecessor. When asked about Democrats in the House of Representatives saying they would introduce articles of impeachment against Donald Trump, Biden said his ""number one concern"" was getting Covid under control. ""I'm focused on the virus, vaccine and economic growth,"" Biden answered, adding that he plans on introducing legislation immediately upon taking office to deal with the virus and the economy.

In a series of media appearances after the riot, he defended his involvement, saying it was important for people ""to see the truth"" and ""see it raw"". When air force veteran and Trump supporter Ashli Babbitt was shot inside the building - the first known casualty of the violence - Sullivan and an associate were at close range. They later provided video to the Washington Post. Sullivan - who currently faces two criminal charges that stem from a separate protest in Utah - also spoke to major media outlets, including CNN and Fox News, on Wednesday and Thursday. Following these appearances, he was briefly detained by DC police, but he does not appear to have been arrested and formally charged for his role in the security breach. On the heels of the impeachment news, the White House has responded by saying this is a time for coming together. ""As President Trump said yesterday, this is a time for healing and unity as one nation,"" a White House statement to CNN reads. ""A politically motivated impeachment against a president with 12 days remaining in his term will only serve to further divide our great country."" Here's more on those impending impeachment articles. According to a four-page draft posted by NBC News, the first charge against Trump is ""incitement of insurrection"". ""Donald John Trump engaged in high Crimes and Misdemeanors by willfully inciting violence against the Government of the United States,"" the draft reads. The lawmakers accuse the president of making statements that encouraged and resulted in ""imminent lawless action at the Capitol"". The draft also says this was ""consistent with his prior efforts to subvert and obstruct"" the certification of President-elect Joe Biden's win. ""He thereby betrayed his trust as President, to the manifest injury of the people of the United States."" Three Democrats - Congressmen Ted Lieu, David Cicilline and Jamie Raskin - are planning on introducing articles of impeachment against President Trump on Monday. Articles of impeachment are charges brought against a president by the House of Rperesentatives. If the House votes to pass them, proceedings move to the Senate, which decides whether or not to convict. CBS News, the BBC's US partner, reports that the bill has nearly 160 co-sponsors in the House. The three authors reportedly began drafting it while they were sheltering-in-place during Wednesday's riot. Dozens of people have been taken into custody as the dust settles from Wednesday's violence at the US Capitol. Here are some of the offenders: Congresswoman Mary Miller had called Hitler 'right' A Republican lawmaker who had been in office for less than a week when she invoked German dictator Adolf Hitler in a Washington speech has apologised for saying that she agreed with the mass murderer. Illinois Congresswoman Mary Miller had said in a speech on Tuesday outside the Capitol, one day before her fellow Trump supporters ransacked the building, that Hitler had been ""right"". Miller told the crowd: ""You know, if we win a few elections weâre still going to be losing unless we win the hearts of our children. ""Itâs the battle. Hitler was right on one thing - that whoever has the youth has the future.""  Hitler, among his supporters in Germany in 1933 The comments drew large-scale condemnation, with the US Holocaust Memorial Museum saying in a statement that it ""unequivocally condemns any leader trying to advance a position by claiming Adolf Hitler was âright.â"" Under Hitler, millions of Jews and other minority groups were murdered across Europe by Germany and its allies during World War Two. On Friday, Miller insisted that she is not anti-semitic and accused other of ""trying to intentionally twist my words"". ""I sincerely apologise for any harm my words caused and regret using a reference to one of the most evil dictators in history to illustrate the dangers that outside influences can have on our youth,"" she said.

On Wednesday - after an armed mob invaded the US Capitol building - Graham joined other members of Congress in returning to certify the election results. In a speech before his colleagues, he declared Joe Biden to be ""lawfully elected"" and thus ""the legitimate president"". On Friday, a crowd of angry Trump loyalists confronted him in a DC-area airport, labelling him a ""traitor"".

These intruders could be charged with an array of crimes, ranging from trespassing and other relatively minor ones to serious offences involving firearms and explosive devices.

Biden also said the unfolding of the situation, with the ""active encouragement of a sitting president"", should be investigated. ""The idea that thousands of people could be marching up the steps of the United States Capitol, breaking the windows, breaking doors, forcing their way in... and it looked like you had some of the Capitol police taking selfies with these people.

"Democrats plan to start impeachment proceedings against Donald Trump on Monday, for inciting the invasion of the US Capitol It is extremely unlikely the proceedings would clear Congress, but they could be a symbolic gesture House speaker Nancy Pelosi said she had also spoken to the military about precautions to prevent Mr Trump ordering a war or nuclear strike 'I will not be going to the inauguration"" - Donald Trump says he will break custom and snub Joe Biden's swearing-in on 20 January Five people have died in relation to the riot, including Brian Sicknick, a US Capitol Police officer Several people have been charged in connection with the violence, including a politician from West Virginia Edited by Alix Kroeger We're pausing our live coverage on the
aftermath of Wednesday's events at the US Capitol for now. Thanks for reading. The majority of Americans questioned (57%) said they thought President Donald Trump should be immediately removed from office following events in the Capitol on Wednesday, a Reuters/Ipsos poll suggests. As many as seven out of 10 Trump supporters - those who voted for Trump in November's presidential election - who participated in the national public opinion survey on Thursday and Friday condemned the violence, which led to the deaths of four civilians and a police officer. The poll useda sample of 1,005 Americans aged 18 or over.,externalThe sample included 490 Democrat voters, 363 Republican voters and a number of independent voters. The siege at the Capitol, as US Congress attempted to certify Joe Biden's victory in the presidential election, took place just hours after Trump addressed supporters and told them: ""We will never give up; we will never concede."" Following Wednesdayâs events,
there's been much discussion about whether Trump can be removed
from office, as Democrats are demanding. There are two ways that this
could be done. 25th amendment The 25th
amendment to the constitution allows the vice-president to become acting president when a sitting president
is deemed unable to continue his or her duties. Section four of the
amendment allows the vice-president and a majority of the cabinet to make this determination. Impeachment For a president to be impeached, charges must first be brought to the House and passed in a simple majority vote. It's possible the Democrats could do this next week, making Trump the first president in history to be impeached twice. Proceedings then move to the Senate but it's seen as unlikely that there would be enough time to complete the trial there. Even if this did happen, a two-thirds majority is required to vote for a president's removal, which would involve a lot of Republicans having to support it. We've put together a guide on these processes, if you'd like to read it. The FBI earlier released this image of a suspect wanted in connection with the planting of suspected pipe bombs in Washington The FBI is offering a reward of up to $50,000 (Â£37,000) for information as investigators try to track down those responsible for planting two pipe bombs in Republican and Democratic party headquarters during the attack on the US Capitol. Police received reports of suspected devices on Wednesday. Today, the FBI said in a statement that rewards would be issued on information that leads to ""the location, arrest and conviction"" of suspects. Bomb technicians used water cannon,externalto break the devices apart and render them harmless during the riots in Washington DC, ABC News reported. While rioters in the nation's capital made headlines, Trump supporters rallied at state capitols across America to protest against the election results. In the state of Washington, a crowd marched from the capitol and broke in to the grounds of the governor's mansion. This video can not be played How protests swept across the US In a break with her party, Republican Alaska Senator Lisa Murkowski says it's time for Trump to leave. ""He has caused enough damage,â Murkowskitold the Anchorage Daily News on Friday.,external ""I think he should leave. He said heâs not going to show up. Heâs not going to appear at the inauguration. He hasnât been focused on what is going on with Covid,"" she said. The senator added that Trump has been either golfing or ""fuming and throwing every single person who has been loyal and faithful to him under the bus"" - including Vice-President Mike Pence. ""He only wants to stay there for his ego. He needs to get out. He needs to do the good thing, but I donât think heâs capable of doing a good thing."" When asked about her ties to the Republican Party, Murkowski said: ""If the Republican Party has become nothing more than the party of Trump, I sincerely question whether this is the party for me."" Our North America reporter Anthony Zurcher noted that Murkowski won her senate race as a write-in candidate, and could survive without the Republican Party.

"Jessica Allen (left) and Eliza Moore are now sticking to walks nearer their homes A police force that was criticised for its ""intimidating"" approach to two walkers is to review its lockdown fines policy. Jessica Allen and Eliza Moore said they were surrounded by police after driving five miles from their home for a walk on Wednesday, and fined Â£200 each. Derbyshire Police initially said driving to exercise was ""not in the spirit"" of lockdown. But it now says new national guidelines mean it will review its position. In a statement, the force said all of its fixed penalties issued during the new national lockdown will be reviewed. Ms Allen, from Ashby-de-la-Zouch in Leicestershire, said she assumed ""someone had been murdered"" when she arrived at Foremark Reservoir on Wednesday afternoon. When she and her friend were questioned by police, they were also told by officers the hot drinks they had brought along were not allowed as they were ""classed as a picnic"". Seal sightseeing couple fined for 130-mile trip What can police do to enforce lockdown rules? Covid 'out of control in London', Sadiq Khan says She said: ""The next thing, my car is surrounded. I got out of my car thinking 'There's no way they're coming to speak to us'. Straight away they start questioning us. ""I said we had come in separate cars, even parked two spaces away and even brought our own drinks with us. He said 'You can't do that as it's classed as a picnic'."" Ms Allen said the experience was ""very intimidating"" and had left her feeling scared of police in general. Foremark Reservoir is five miles away from where Jessica Allen and Eliza Moore live Her friend, Ms Moore, said she was ""stunned at the time"" so did not challenge police and gave her details so they could send a fixed penalty notice. At the time Derbyshire Police said that driving to a location to exercise ""is clearly not in the spirit of the national effort to reduce our travel, reduce the possible spread of the disease and reduce the number of deaths"". The force added: ""Where there are cases of blatant breaches of the regulations then fines will be issued by officers."" Derbyshire Police has also been giving fixed penalty notices to people who visit Calke Abbey and Elvaston Castle. Fixed penalty notices have been given to people who visit Calke Abbey, a National Trust property But in a statement, the force said further guidance issued by the National Police Chiefs Council (NPCC) had ""clarified the policing response concerning travel and exercise"". The guidance said: ""The Covid regulations which officers enforce and which enables them to issue FPNs [fixed penalty notices] for breaches, do not restrict the distance travelled for exercise."" The NPCC added that rather than issue fines for people who travel out of their local area ""but are not breaching regulations, officers will encourage people to follow the guidance"". The force has now said it will be ""aligning to adhere to this stance"". Assistant Chief Constable Kem Mehmet said: ""We are grateful for the guidance from the NPCC.

"Ms Sturgeon has rejected claims made by former first minister Alex Salmond Alex Salmond has accused Nicola Sturgeon of misleading parliament, calling evidence she gave to an inquiry into the handling of sexual harassment claims against him ""simply untrue"". Mr Salmond's comments emerged in a written submission to a separate investigation into whether the first minister breached the ministerial code. The submission has been shared with the Holyrood committee. Ms Sturgeon says she ""entirely rejects Mr Salmond's claims"". In the submission, the former first minister said that Ms Sturgeon had misled parliament and broken the ministerial code with breaches including failing to inform the civil service in good time of her meetings with him. He claimed she allowed the Scottish government to contest a civil court case against him despite having had legal advice that it was likely to collapse. Ms Sturgeon told the Holyrood inquiry she had become aware of allegations at a meeting with Mr Salmond at her home. Nicola Sturgeon 'forgot' about meeting with Alex Salmond aide Nicola Sturgeon says husband 'being used as a weapon' against her It since emerged she met his former chief of staff in the days before, but she said she had forgotten about that meeting. Mr Salmond said that claim was untenable. His submission said that she misled parliament, and that amounted to a breach of the code. He also said she breached the code by failing to to inform civil servants of the nature of the meetings that took place between the two of them at her home where the allegations were discussed. Alex Salmond walked free from court in March having been cleared of charges of sexual assault Mr Salmond's statement read: ""The pre-arranged meeting in the Scottish Parliament of 29 March 2018 was ""forgotten"" about because acknowledging it would have rendered ridiculous the claim made by the first minister in parliament that it had been believed that the meeting on 2 April was on SNP Party business and thus held at her private residence."" Both Mr Salmond and Ms Sturgeon are expected to give evidence to the committee in the coming weeks. Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross responded to the claims, saying: ""Nobody ever bought Nicola Sturgeon's tall tales to have suddenly turned forgetful, especially about the devastating moment she found out of sexual harassment allegations against her friend and mentor of 30 years. ""What has been revealed are allegations of shocking, deliberate and corrupt actions at the heart of government. There is now clear evidence of Nicola Sturgeon abusing her power to deceive the Scottish public. ""If this proves to be correct, it is a resignation matter. No first minister, at any time, can be allowed to get away with repeatedly and blatantly lying to the Scottish Parliament and breaking the ministerial code."" Scottish Labour deputy leader Jackie Baillie said Alex Salmond's explosive allegations demanded answers from the first minister to the committee. She said: ""The bombshell accusation that Nicola Sturgeon has broken the ministerial code has the potential to end her political career and demands a robust and honest answer from the first minister. ""This committee demands truthfulness and honesty from every witness it calls - it is vital that the first minister tells the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth when she appears."" Ms Sturgeon has repeatedly dismissed any notion of a conspiracy against Mr Salmond. Her spokeswoman said: ""The first minister entirely rejects Mr Salmond's claims about the ministerial code. ""We should always remember that the roots of this issue lie in complaints made by women about Alex Salmond's behaviour whilst he was first minister, aspects of which he has conceded. It is not surprising therefore that he continues to try to divert focus from that by seeking to malign the reputation of the first minister and by spinning false conspiracy theories. ""The first minister is concentrating on fighting the pandemic, stands by what she has said, and will address these matters in full when she appears at committee."" Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Any Questions on Friday evening, SNP Westminster leader Ian Blackford MP said he did not believe the accusations about the first minister were correct. He said: ""I believe that the first minister has acted in an honourable way, she's someone that I've every faith and trust in. ""I can tell you that the approval ratings for the first minister, the respect that she has right up and down the country of Scotland is enormous and this is something that will pass, when she appears in front of the committee these matters will be dealt with."" Alex Salmond has just turned up the heat on his successor with a submission that presents a direct and serious challenge to the reputation of Nicola Sturgeon - who was once his closest political ally. What he no doubt considers as an attempt to secure justice, some others will see as a case of deflection and revenge. Allegations of breaking the ministerial code of conduct and misleading parliament are serious and, if upheld, potentially career threatening. Yet even some of Ms Sturgeon's fiercest critics at Holyrood do not expect the inquiries into the Scottish government's mishandling of harassment complaints against Mr Salmond to force her from office. Mr Salmond seems to expect the review of the first minister's actions under the ministerial code of conduct to remain narrow enough that it could not possibly find against her. The first minister herself appears confident of persuading all comers, including a cross-party committee of MSPs (before which both she and Mr Salmond are due to appear in the coming weeks) that she has acted properly throughout.

"Fashion student Mhari Thurston-Tyler posted an advert for the ""crop top"" (right) on Depop after she says she found some discarded Chiltern Railways seat covers (like those on the left) A fashion student has been warned not to sell prohibited items on the clothes app, Depop, after she posted an advert for a top made from a train seat cover. Mhari Thurston-Tyler made the bandeau out of a Chiltern Railways seat cover designed to promote social distancing during the coronavirus pandemic. The 20-year-old sold the top for Â£15 but later refunded her customer and took the advert down. Depop said the item ""clearly violates our terms of service"". The app for buying and selling second-hand clothes said the sale of stolen goods was banned - but Ms Thurston-Tyler denied stealing. She told BBC News she found two of the blue seat covers ""balled up on the floor"" outside Marylebone station in London in September. Ms Thurston-Tyler, who is a fashion student at Central Saint Martins, re-sewed one of the covers to make it fit her, before deciding to advertise the second cover on Depop. ""I have no money at the moment so decided to put the second one on Depop to see if anyone would buy it,"" she said, adding that the app had become her main source of income as she has struggled to find other work during the pandemic. ""I have to resort to little things like this to make ends meet, to pay the bills."" Ms Thurston-Tyler's advert went viral on social media after being shared byDepop Drama's Instagram,externalandTwitter,externalaccounts. Mhari Thurston-Tyler said she has been unable to find a job during the coronavirus pandemic and sells clothes on Depop ""to make ends meet"" In the advert, Ms Thurston-Tyler models the seat cover and describes it as a ""social distancing crop"", adding: ""Got a few of these can do different sizes."" Ms Thurston-Tyler, from Kenilworth in Warwickshire, said a Depop customer paid her Â£15 and ordered a crop top ""in extra small"". But realising she should not be making money out of Chiltern Railways' property, Ms Thurston-Tyler refunded the customer 15 minutes later and took the advert down shortly afterwards. ""I didn't steal it but I understand it's not right to re-sell it,"" she said. 'I made Â£1,265 selling my clothes second-hand' Can pre-loved clothes make fast fashion sustainable? A Depop spokesperson said Ms Thurston-Tyler would be banned from the platform if she listed any other prohibited goods. ""We explicitly prohibit the sale of illegal and unlawful content on the app, including any stolen goods,"" they said. ""This item clearly violates our terms of service, but as it has been removed by the seller and is no longer for sale on the platform, we will not be taking immediate steps to ban this user."" Ms Thurston-Tyler said she hopes to make her own line of crop tops with the words ""children railways"" on the design, while ""the hype"" of the viral moment continues. Chiltern Railways said it has been using the social distancing ""seat sashes"" since the beginning of the UK's Covid epidemic. A spokeswoman added: ""Whilst we appreciate this new take on railway memorabilia, these items are there to help customers travel with confidence and we would respectfully ask that they are left in place.""

"Kelvin Hopkins, 79, has denied sexual harassment allegations A former Labour MP has quit the party before disciplinary proceedings against him concerning sexual harassment could be concluded, Labour has said. Kelvin Hopkins was suspended by the party in 2017 after a Labour activist, Ava Etemadzadeh, accused him of inappropriate physical contact. Ms Etemadzadeh said the ex-MP's exit from the party was ""disappointing"". The BBC has attempted to contact Mr Hopkins, 79, for a response, but he has previously denied the accusations. A Labour spokesperson said it ""takes all complaints of sexual harassment extremely seriously and they are fully investigated in line with our rules and procedures, and any appropriate disciplinary action is taken. ""We are disappointed that the party's disciplinary processes did not reach a conclusion due to Kelvin Hopkins' decision to resign his membership,"" they added. ""We are establishing an independent process to investigate complaints, including sexual harassment, to ensure complainants can feel confident that in coming forward they will be heard and get the justice they deserve."" Mr Hopkins, who first won the seat of Luton North from the Conservatives in 1997, stood down ahead of the 2019 election - a decision, he said, which was to do with his wife's health, not the accusations. He had originally been referred to the party's National Constitutional Committee following the allegations in 2017 and had expressed frustration at the length of time the hearing was taking. Responding to his decision to leave the party, Ms Etemadzadeh tweeted: ""This is very disappointing news. I hope Keir Starmer listens to my concerns and fixes this broken system.""

"Harley Watson's mother Jo described him as a ""kind, caring, selfless, intelligent and comical young man"" A man who killed a 12-year-old boy by driving into schoolchildren in a ""deliberate"" hit and run has been detained in a secure hospital. Harley Watson died after he was hit by a car outside Debden Park High School in Loughton, Essex, on 2 December 2019. Terence Glover, 52,pleaded guilty to manslaughter by diminished responsibilityat an earlier hearing.

"This video can not be played One floral tribute had Dame Barbara's photograph in the centre The funeral of EastEnders and Carry On actress Dame Barbara Windsor has taken place in London. Ross Kemp, who played her on-screen son in the soap, was among the 30 mourners and gave a reading, as did actor and friend Christopher Biggins. Dame Barbaradied in December at the age of 83, having had dementia. There were floral arrangements spelling Babs, The Dame and Saucy, and a mock pub sign showing her as The Queen Peggy in the style of the soap's Queen Vic. Dame Barbara played pub landlady Peggy Mitchell in EastEnders for more than two decades. A version of the EastEnders Queen Vic pub sign was painted in tribute Scott Mitchell, who was married to Dame Barbara for 20 years, was joined at Golders Green Crematorium by family and friends including comedians Matt Lucas and David Walliams. ""As Covid has denied so many of Barbara's family, friends and fans a chance to say farewell properly, I wanted to share the order of service to let people be a small part of it,"" Mr Mitchell told the PA news agency. ""My heart goes out to every family who have experienced the same restrictions at their loved ones' funerals."" Left-right: Christopher Biggins, Ross Kemp and David Walliams were among the mourners He added: ""I would again like to thank my family, friends, the media and the public for their incredible support and well wishes since Barbara's passing."" Dame Barbara's coffin was brought into the crematorium to sound of Frank Sinatra's On The Sunny Side Of The Street, and the service featured a recording of Sparrows Can't Sing from the actress's 1963 film of the same. It finished with the famous topless photo of Dame Barbara from the film Carry On Camping, alongside her quote: ""That picture will follow me to the end."" Long-time friend Anna Karen, who played Dame Barbara's on-screen sister Aunt Sal in EastEnders, also paid tribute during the service. The funeral was also attended by Loose Women's Jane Moore and EastEnders actor Jamie Borthwick. However, the numbers were limited due to coronavirus social distancing. Alzheimer's Research UK recently said it had seen a spike in donations since Dame Barbara's death, and a JustGiving page set up as a tribute to her and in aid of the charity has raised more than Â£150,000 (including Gift Aid).

"The switch has been welcomed by climate campaigners Alok Sharma is to leave his position as business secretary to focus full-time on his role as president of the UN COP26 climate conference in November. The Glasgow event is expected to be the biggest summit the UK has ever hosted. Mr Sharma, who will remain in the cabinet, said he was ""delighted to have been asked by the PM to dedicate all my energies"" to the position. Kwasi Kwarteng replaces him as business secretary while Anne-Marie Trevelyan becomes the new energy minister. The government says a successful summit will be critical if the UK wants to meet the objectives set out by the Paris Agreement and reduce global emissions. The event had originally been scheduled for November 2020 but was delayed by a year due to Covid-19. Sharma 'overloaded' to juggle UN summit role 2020 in a dead heat for warmest year on record Why 2021 could be turning point for tackling climate change The BBC's political correspondent Jessica Parker said the decision to move Alok Sharma wasn't a surprise and would be seen as a recognition of the need to free him up to do more of the crucial diplomatic leg-work required. SomeMPs had previously warnedthat Mr Sharma lacked the ""bandwidth"" to head the conference alongside his cabinet job, especially given the strains on business due to the pandemic. In his new role, which is based in the Cabinet Office, Mr Sharma's will remain a member of Boris Johnson's top team but be focused solely on coordinating global action to tackle climate change Boris Johnson chose Mr Sharma to head the event after ex-minister Claire O'Neill was ousted from the position in the summer of 2019. She later condemned what she called broken promises and backsliding on climate commitments. Former Conservative PM David Cameron turned down the chance to head the conference and ex-Foreign Secretary Lord Hague was also involved in discussions. Mr Sharma's move will be welcomed by climate campaigners, who worried he was over-stretched running a frantically busy department while also orchestrating the most important climate meeting on Earth. Many of these summits - known as COPs - yielded little because the leadership was poor. The French produced a triumphant agreement in the 2015 Paris COP after mustering the mighty force of French diplomacy. Mr Sharma is reported to accept that he now needs to concentrate full time on the challenge. He will need subtle diplomatic skills, a mastery of detail and the stamina of an ox as he attempts to corral world leaders into agreement on curbing emissions faster. He'll also need 100% support from the PM. The greatest obstacle to action - Donald Trump - will soon disappear from the scene, and with China making bold promises, the COP has potential. But politicians have been so slow to act that some key tipping points in the climate might already have been breached. Reflecting on his new role, Mr Sharma said: ""The biggest challenge of our time is climate change and we need to work together to deliver a cleaner, greener world and build back better for present and future generations. ""Through the UK's Presidency of COP26 we have a unique opportunity, working with friends and partners around the world, to deliver on this goal."" Richard Black, senior associate at the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit (ECIU) said: ""Allowing Alok Sharma to focus full-time on his COP26 role is a sensible decision, not least as it signals the government's commitment to ensuring that the summit is a success. Kwasi Kwarteng was succeed Mr Sharma as business secretary ""With the election of Joe Biden as the next US President and China's recent carbon neutrality pledge, the diplomatic opportunities have opened up for more ambitious action on climate change. Mr Sharma's job will be to seize them."" And ex-cabinet minister Amber Rudd, who led the UK delegation at the Paris climate change conference, said the move showed the government ""recognises the importance and opportunity for a global agreement this year"". Responding to his new appointment, Mr Kwarteng said he was ""thrilled"" and pledged to help businesses through this period of ""extremely challenging circumstances"". The Spelthorne MP, who entered Parliament in 2010, has been energy minister since July 2019. Labour's shadow business secretary Ed Miliband said Mr Kwarteng had ""a massive task"" in providing business with ""a plan to help them through this year, not the inadequate sticking plaster measures we have seen"". He welcomed the decision to make Mr Sharma's COP role full time. ""It's absolutely crucial that the full political, diplomatic and strategic resources of government are now directed to the most ambitious outcome at Glasgow, which is a 1.5 degree deal."" 2020 in a dead heat for warmest year on record Green body gives verdict on UK's climate policies At least 10 confirmed dead in Los Angeles wildfires What's the latest on the LA fires, and what caused them?

""This committee demands truthfulness and honesty from every witness it calls - it is vital that the first minister tells the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth when she appears."" Ms Sturgeon has repeatedly dismissed any notion of a conspiracy against Mr Salmond. Her spokeswoman said: ""The first minister entirely rejects Mr Salmond's claims about the ministerial code. ""We should always remember that the roots of this issue lie in complaints made by women about Alex Salmond's behaviour whilst he was first minister, aspects of which he has conceded. It is not surprising therefore that he continues to try to divert focus from that by seeking to malign the reputation of the first minister and by spinning false conspiracy theories. ""The first minister is concentrating on fighting the pandemic, stands by what she has said, and will address these matters in full when she appears at committee."" Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Any Questions on Friday evening, SNP Westminster leader Ian Blackford MP said he did not believe the accusations about the first minister were correct. He said: ""I believe that the first minister has acted in an honourable way, she's someone that I've every faith and trust in. ""I can tell you that the approval ratings for the first minister, the respect that she has right up and down the country of Scotland is enormous and this is something that will pass, when she appears in front of the committee these matters will be dealt with."" Alex Salmond has just turned up the heat on his successor with a submission that presents a direct and serious challenge to the reputation of Nicola Sturgeon - who was once his closest political ally. What he no doubt considers as an attempt to secure justice, some others will see as a case of deflection and revenge. Allegations of breaking the ministerial code of conduct and misleading parliament are serious and, if upheld, potentially career threatening. Yet even some of Ms Sturgeon's fiercest critics at Holyrood do not expect the inquiries into the Scottish government's mishandling of harassment complaints against Mr Salmond to force her from office. Mr Salmond seems to expect the review of the first minister's actions under the ministerial code of conduct to remain narrow enough that it could not possibly find against her. The first minister herself appears confident of persuading all comers, including a cross-party committee of MSPs (before which both she and Mr Salmond are due to appear in the coming weeks) that she has acted properly throughout.

"Jessica Allen (left) and Eliza Moore are now sticking to walks nearer their homes A police force that was criticised for its ""intimidating"" approach to two walkers is to review its lockdown fines policy. Jessica Allen and Eliza Moore said they were surrounded by police after driving five miles from their home for a walk on Wednesday, and fined Â£200 each. Derbyshire Police initially said driving to exercise was ""not in the spirit"" of lockdown. But it now says new national guidelines mean it will review its position. In a statement, the force said all of its fixed penalties issued during the new national lockdown will be reviewed. Ms Allen, from Ashby-de-la-Zouch in Leicestershire, said she assumed ""someone had been murdered"" when she arrived at Foremark Reservoir on Wednesday afternoon. When she and her friend were questioned by police, they were also told by officers the hot drinks they had brought along were not allowed as they were ""classed as a picnic"". Seal sightseeing couple fined for 130-mile trip What can police do to enforce lockdown rules? Covid 'out of control in London', Sadiq Khan says She said: ""The next thing, my car is surrounded. I got out of my car thinking 'There's no way they're coming to speak to us'. Straight away they start questioning us. ""I said we had come in separate cars, even parked two spaces away and even brought our own drinks with us. He said 'You can't do that as it's classed as a picnic'."" Ms Allen said the experience was ""very intimidating"" and had left her feeling scared of police in general. Foremark Reservoir is five miles away from where Jessica Allen and Eliza Moore live Her friend, Ms Moore, said she was ""stunned at the time"" so did not challenge police and gave her details so they could send a fixed penalty notice. At the time Derbyshire Police said that driving to a location to exercise ""is clearly not in the spirit of the national effort to reduce our travel, reduce the possible spread of the disease and reduce the number of deaths"". The force added: ""Where there are cases of blatant breaches of the regulations then fines will be issued by officers."" Derbyshire Police has also been giving fixed penalty notices to people who visit Calke Abbey and Elvaston Castle. Fixed penalty notices have been given to people who visit Calke Abbey, a National Trust property But in a statement, the force said further guidance issued by the National Police Chiefs Council (NPCC) had ""clarified the policing response concerning travel and exercise"". The guidance said: ""The Covid regulations which officers enforce and which enables them to issue FPNs [fixed penalty notices] for breaches, do not restrict the distance travelled for exercise."" The NPCC added that rather than issue fines for people who travel out of their local area ""but are not breaching regulations, officers will encourage people to follow the guidance"". The force has now said it will be ""aligning to adhere to this stance"". Assistant Chief Constable Kem Mehmet said: ""We are grateful for the guidance from the NPCC. ""The actions of our officers continues to be to protect the public, the NHS and to help save lives."" It is not the first time the force has been accused of being overzealous in enforcing alleged lockdown breaches. In the country's first lockdown in March the use of adrone to film people walking in the Peak District was labelled ""nanny policing"".

"Film director Michael Apted, best known for the Up series of TV documentaries following the lives of 14 people every seven years, has died aged 79. He also directed Coal Miner's Daughter, Gorillas In The Mist and the 1999 Bond movie The World Is Not Enough. The original 7 Up in 1964 set out to document the life prospects of a range of children from all walks of life. The show was inspired by the Aristotle quote ""give me a child until he is seven and I will show you the man"". The first 7 Up show was followed by 14 Up at the start of the next decade, which interviewed the same children as teenagers - and the pattern was set right up until 63 Up in 2019. Throughout all those intervening years ITV viewers became engrossed with the stories of private school trio Andrew, Charles and John, of Jackie who went through two divorces, of Neil who went from jobless and homeless to Liberal Democrat councillor, and of working class chatterbox Tony, whose life ambition was to become a jockey. Apted: '7 Up needed more girls' Apted's shows - which won three Bafta awards - have often been described as the forerunner of modern-day reality TV series, giving its participants the time to tell their own stories on screen. But unlike their modern counterparts, the original Up children tended to fade away from the limelight in the seven years between each chapter. In 2008, Apted was made a companion of the Most Distinguished Order of Saint Michael and Saint George in the Queen's Birthday Honours for services to the British film and television industries. Thomas Schlamme, president of the Directors Guild of America, said Apted was a ""fearless visionary"" whose legacy would live on. He said Apted, who was born in Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire, ""saw the trajectory of things when others didn't and we were all beneficiaries of his wisdom and lifelong dedication"". ITV's managing director Kevin Lygo said the director's six-decade career was ""in itself truly remarkable"". He said the Up series ""demonstrated the possibilities of television at its finest in its ambition and its capacity to hold up a mirror to society and engage with and entertain people while enriching our perspective on the human condition"". Apted directed the 19th James Bond film The World Is Not Enough ""The influence of Michael's contribution to film and programme-making continues to be felt and he will be sadly missed,"" Lygo added. Michael G Wilson and Barbara Broccoli, producers of the James Bond film franchise, said Apted ""was a director of enormous talent"" and ""beloved by all those who worked with him"". ""We loved working with him on The World Is Not Enough and send our love and support to his family, friends and colleagues,"" they said. A post on the Twitter account of the band Garbage, who performed the theme for The World Is Not Enough, labelled Apted a ""delightful, charming soul"". Allow Twitter content?

Composer David G Arnold, who composed the Bond theme and worked with Apted on three other non-Bond movies, said he felt ""lucky"" to work with him. ""A more trusting, funny, friendly and, most importantly, kind, person you'd never meet. So pleased to have known him and so sad that he's gone,"" Arnold wrote on Twitter.

"The number of people in Scotland who have died within 28 days of testing positive for the virus now stands at 4,872 Scotland's hospitals have more Covid patients than ever before - with the number of deaths also ""distressingly high"", the first minister has said. The latest figures showed that the deaths of 93 people who had tested positive for the virus have been recorded in the past 24 hours. But the figure includes some people who died over Christmas and New Year. There were also 1,530 people in hospital with the virus, higher than the peak of 1,520 last April. Of these, 102 patients were in intensive care - with Ms Sturgeon saying the statistics showed the ""severity of the pressure"" that hospitals are facing. The 93 deaths recorded on Friday is the highest daily figure since the outbreak began - with the previous high being 84 on 15 April. How many Covid cases have there been in your area? Third Covid vaccine approved in the UK When will I be vaccinated against Covid? Travellers to UK will need to show negative test But Ms Sturgeon said the figure will ""undoubtedly include some people who died over the Christmas and New Year period and the delay in registration because of the bank holidays means that their deaths are only being reported today."" She added: ""To be clear, that is not more than 90 people who died yesterday. It will be people who have died over a period of time. ""That does not change the fact they are all individuals who have died and have died of Covid."" A further 2,309 people have tested positive for Covid-19, which was 8.1% of the tests carried out on Thursday and takes the total number of cases in Scotland to 146,024. The figures mean that the total number of people in Scotland who have died within 28 days of testing positive for the virus now stands at 4,872. The Scottish government has said it is concerned that too many people have not been following the ""stay at home"" rules that are in place across the whole of the mainland and some islands. It believes that more people are using the country's road and public transport networks than during the lockdown last spring. And it has warned that tougher restrictions could be needed to increase compliance with the travel restrictions. What are the latest Covid rules in Scotland? Ms Sturgeon told her daily briefing that the areas being looked at included non-essential click and collect shopping, further restrictions on takeaway food, non-essential construction and whether more people should be working from home. The first minister also confirmed that universities and colleges will not resume in-person teaching until at least the end of February. This means that students should stay at home rather than travelling back to their campus or accommodation. There will be exceptions for cases where remote study is not possible - for example for a student nurse or a doctor on a practical placement. And Ms Sturgeon said any students who have remained on campus will be ""fully supported"" by their institution. All of mainland Scotland was placed into level four restrictions from 26 December before additional measures, including closing schools to most pupils until at least the end of the month, was introduced on Tuesday. Scotland's interim chief medical officer, Dr Dave Caesar, insisted on Friday morning that coronavirus case numbers in January ""could have been worse"". He said the restrictions that were introduced on Boxing Day had helped to ""blunt the spike"" but warned that the country was ""not out of the woods yet"". Dr Caesar told the BBC'sGood Morning Scotlandprogramme: ""Our case numbers are high, but they're not as high as they could have been if we hadn't taken the measures that we undertook from Boxing Day. ""Our health system is under serious pressure but is coping. ""I hate to say it, but it could have been worse by this time in January. We're not out of the woods yet by any stretch of the imagination, but I suppose we're holding our own in very significantly challenging circumstances."" New Covid testing measures for international travellers are to be introduced New plans tomake international passengers test negative for Covid-19before travelling to Scotland and England have also been unveiled, with Ms Sturgeon saying she hoped the scheme could start by the end of next week. It will mean people arriving by plane, train or boat - including UK nationals - will have to take a test up to 72 hours before leaving the country they are travelling from. Prof Linda Bauld of Edinburgh University said the move was long overdue as the UK had ""really struggled from the beginning"" with limiting the impact of international travel on the pandemic. But she said the country should also consider introducing supervised quarantine for people arriving from overseas. LEVELS:What are the restrictions in your area?

"Marks & Spencer has temporarily stopped selling hundreds of items in its Northern Ireland stores due to Brexit red tape. The retailer said it feared its food would be blocked due to new rules governing shipments between Great Britain and Northern Ireland. A growing number of firms have spoken out about paperwork delays at ports. The government said traders and hauliers need to take steps to comply with new border rules. M&S took the decision to temporarily drop hundreds of products, including chocolate fudge pudding and sweet and sour chicken, from its Northern Ireland stores after it saw competitors' lorries barred from travelling between the mainland and Northern Ireland. An entire consignment in a lorry can be held up if only one item in the truck doesn't have the correct customs forms filled out. The retailer said it aimed to get the products back up for sale soon. An M&S spokesperson said: ""We have served customers in Northern Ireland for over 50 years and our priority is to make sure we continue to deliver the same choice and great quality range that our loyal customers have always enjoyed. ""Stores have been receiving regular deliveries this week, however following the UK's recent departure from the EU, we are transitioning to new processes and we're working closely with our partners and suppliers to ensure customers can continue to enjoy a great range of products."" In addition to problems shipping goods internally in the UK, the new Brexit trade rules are creating problems for exporters and traders transporting goods to and from the EU, say firms. The UK sealed a trade deal with the European Union (EU) on 24 December that was billed as preserving its zero-tariff and zero-quota access to the bloc's single market. But in addition to red tape causing delays, major retailers that use the UK as a distribution hub for European business could face possible tariffs if they re-export goods to the EU. On Friday, M&S chief executive Steve Rowe warned of more red tape and a rise in export costs to some countries. ""The best example I can give you of that is Percy Pig,"" he said, ""Percy Pig is actually manufactured in Germany. If it comes to the UK and we then send it to Ireland, in theory it would have some tax on it,"" he added. M&S said it was ""actively working to mitigate"" the effects of the ""rules of origin"" regulations, under which products are taxed differently depending on which country they come from. Other firms have also been hit by the confusion caused by new Brexit trading rules. Parcels giant DPD has suspended some services, while seafood exporter John Ross said the chaos was like being ""thrown in the cold Atlantic without a lifejacket"". Shane Brennan, chief executive of the Cold Chain Federation, which represents chilled transport and storage companies, said the emerging problems had come despite the amount of cross-border traffic still being quite low. ""Trade flows are still only about 50% of what we would expect, but even at those levels we are seeing levels of confusion and delays,"" he told the BBC's Today programme. ""The feeling is we are building to quite a significant potential disruption."" John Lewis scrapping overseas deliveries Were there hold-ups in first week after Brexit? Why are there empty shelves in some supermarkets? Covid tests for Channel hauliers to continue A government spokesman acknowledged that there had been ""some issues"", but said ministers had always been clear there would be some disruption at the end of the transition period. The Cabinet Office said in a statement that the volume of border crossings had been low so far this year, but that it expected crossings to steadily increase to normal levels. This brings the potential for ""significant disruption if traders and hauliers have not taken the necessary steps to comply with the new rules,"" the Cabinet Office said. Out of about 1,500 lorries per day trying to get from Great Britain to the EU in the new year, 700 have been turned away - mainly due to a lack of a negative Covid test for drivers, it said. ""We have always been clear there would be changes now that we are out of the customs union and single market, so full compliance with the new rules is vital to avoid disruption,"" said Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove. However, anger is growing among companies whose livelihoods depend on export trade. In a letter on Friday to Business Secretary Alok Sharma, Scottish salmon producer John Ross Jr launched a stinging attack on the government's handling of the situation. The firm's sales director, Victoria Leigh-Pearson, wrote that the company had in recent months ""had to endure the government issuing a barrage of useless information"" and an ""absence of factually correct information from all government agencies."" It amounted, she said, to ""gross incompetence"". John Ross exports to 36 countries and has won the Queen's Award twice Part of the letter to Alok Sharma: As I write, perishable goods that were dispatched from our facility five days ago, headed for France following a process that your department advised, have still not crossed the border. This usually takes only 24 hours because they are consolidated with the produce of other companies, which have not been able to follow the correct procedures due to a knowledge gap directly attributable to your department. Entire trucks are currently being rejected without explanation by the French customs authority. Our hauliers have now pulled their services as such a backlog has been created. Other hauliers are not taking on new customers. Today, we've even had confirmation that the IT systems of the UK and France are incompatible. After four years you only establish this now? Your so-called 'deal' is worthless if this situation is not fixed immediately, and unless you put in place measures to address the issues that continue to unfold on a daily basis. Moreover, as a seafood exporter, it feels as though our own government has thrown us into the cold Atlantic waters without a lifejacket. Yours sincerely, Victoria Leigh-Pearson, Sales Director, John Ross John Ross is not the only Scottish seafood exporter suffering. The industry says it has been hit by a ""perfect storm"" of Brexit disruption, which could sink a centuries-old industry. ""These businesses are not transporting toilet rolls or widgets. They are exporting the highest quality, perishable seafood which has a finite window to get to markets in peak condition,"" said Donna Fordyce, chief executive of Seafood Scotland. ""If the window closes, these consignments go to landfill."" She said the sector has already been weakened by Covid-19, the closure of the French border before Christmas as well as ""layer upon layer"" of problems associated with Brexit. The group fears that without exports, the fishing fleet will have little reason to go out. ""In a very short time, we could see the destruction of a centuries-old market which contributes significantly to the Scottish economy,"" added Ms Fordyce. UK government Minister for Scotland David Duguid blamed Scottish leaders for the issues. ""The Scottish Government has persistently refused to accept the democratic vote to leave the EU, but that does not allow them to abdicate their responsibilities to Scottish businesses,"" he said. ""Over the past 18 months they have assured the fishing industry that the systems they were putting in place would be adequate. They clearly are not."" Parcel delivery service DPD UK said it had paused its European Road Service because of the '""increased burden"" of customs paperwork for packages heading to the EU, including the Republic of Ireland. DPD said 20% of parcels had ""incorrect or incomplete data attached"", which meant they would have to be returned. This video can not be played What Brexit means for Britons travelling, shopping, studying or owning properties in the EU. In an email to its business customers, the company said that it had been a ""challenging few days"" for its international operation, and that it would ""pause and review"" its service.  It plans to restart on 13 January. ""It has now become evident that we have an increased burden with the new, more complex processes, and additional customs data we require from you for your parcels destined to Europe"" the firm wrote. The boss of one of Wales' largest hauliers said logistical problems have emerged at the Irish border too. Andrew Kinsella, managing director of Gwynedd Shipping, said his company has a backlog of 60 lorries waiting to be shipped to Dublin. He said many hauliers are finding that their customers are not able to generate the special declarations that are needed to ultimately enable a lorry to get onto a ferry. ""Whilst you don't see queues at ports and terminals the reality is that these queues are developing elsewhere in our depot in Holyhead, in our depot in Deeside and in our depot in Newport in South Wales, and lots of hauliers have depots in the proximity of ports,"" he said. ""There are a lot of issues about demarcation about who is going to arrange the export declaration with the UK revenue authorities, who's going to arrange the import declaration, the hauliers then trying to arrange the import safety and security declaration to create an ENS number which helps you generate a PBN number so there has been a lot of everyone finding their feet"".

"Edwin Poots said he has asked senior UK government figures to consider unilaterally revoking the NI Protocol The Stormont minister whose officials are responsible for the new Irish Sea border has said some food will be unavailable if changes are not made. DUP Agriculture Minister Edwin Poots has also said jobs could be at risk. He said problems at the ports were being caused by new rules applied on imports of food and other products from Britain to Northern Ireland. Earlier Cabinet Office Minister Michael Gove said trade from GB to NI ""will get worse before it gets better"". Mr Gove said that ""work is ongoing"" and it is ""all part of the process of leaving the European Union"". He added that he had spoken to ministers from all parties in the Northern Ireland Executive. After speaking with hauliers, supermarkets and processors this week, Mr Poots predicted the loss of jobs and rising costs. ""A wide range of frozen and chilled foods will be unavailable after the temporary exemption period ends,"" he tweeted. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

That exemption period applies to supermarkets and other food importers and runs out in April. After that they will have to comply with all the paperwork required to ship food in, or find suppliers on the island of Ireland or elsewhere in the EU. New rules - called the Northern Ireland Protocol - were introduced because while the UK has left the EU, Northern Ireland has remained in the Single Market for goods and is continuing to apply EU customs rules. The arrangement was agreed between the UK and the EU to prevent a hard border on the island of Ireland. Mr Poots said he had spoken to senior UK government figures to ask them to consider unilaterally revoking the protocol as it was ""damaging Northern Ireland at the economic and societal level"". And he hit out at members of Sinn Fein, the SDLP, and Alliance Party who he claimed had supported it. Members of those parties have countered similar claims from other DUP politicians in recent days. They said DUP MPs had voted against alternative arrangements that would have been simpler to manage before the government pushed ahead with the protocol plan. Responding to Mr Poot's tweet on Friday evening, SDLP leader Colum Eastwood wrote: ""You broke it, you own it."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) has called for the assembly to be recalled to discuss difficulties over trading between Great Britain and Northern Ireland due to Brexit. The party has submitted a recall petition. UUP MLA Roy Beggs said: ""The impact of the Irish Sea border is causing horrendous difficulties for hauliers and this is being seen in shops and businesses across Northern Ireland. ""It is damaging the Northern Ireland economy and the situation is escalating."" Earlier on Friday, Michael Gove said it had been expected that there would be ""some initial disruption"" to trade between GB and NI, but that the government is ""ironing"" issues out. He said discussions with the executive in Northern Ireland were ""in order to make sure that the [Northern Ireland] protocol works"". ""[To make sure] that businesses in Northern Ireland can continue to have access to the rest of the UK market, and that Northern Ireland businesses can have the goods that they need on the shelves, that they have access to at the moment,"" he said. Northern Ireland has remained a part of the EU's single market for goods while the rest of the UK has left. This means food products from Great Britain are subject to checks when they enter Northern Ireland. Similar processes and checks also apply when moving food products from Great Britain into the Republic of Ireland. Meanwhile, an organisation representing haulage firms has called on the UK and Irish government to relax some of the new Irish Sea trade border rules. The Road Haulage Association (RHA) said there is serious disruption to freight movements into the island of Ireland. The RHA said relaxing the controls on food products and customs declarations ""would help traders to ship goods that have struggled to move over recent days."" ""The problems have led to gaps in supermarket shelves and lorries delayed at ports because of problems with red-tape and the situation is worsening,"" the organisation added. ""We are facing an inflexible, cumbersome and time consuming process just to move goods."" The UK government said the flow of goods ""between GB and NI has been smooth overall and arrivals of freight have continued to increase substantially over this week"". Why are there empty shelves in some NI supermarkets? Five steps that led to an Irish Sea border Why a Brexit trade deal is different for NI ""There are no significant queues at NI ports and supermarkets are reporting healthy supplies into their Northern Ireland stores,"" a spokesperson added. ""We recognise the need to provide as much support to the haulage sector as possible as industry adapts to new processes. That's why hauliers can benefit from the Trader Support Service, which provides free advice and support to businesses of all sizes moving goods under the Northern Ireland Protocol. ""We have been engaging intensively with the Irish authorities and hauliers on the issues that have been encountered for goods transiting through Dublin port."" On Thursday customs authorities in the Republic of Ireland announced a temporary relaxation of one customs process. Hauliers will be able to use an override code to complete a piece of administration known as ENS. The letters ENS refer to an entry summary declaration, an online form which goods carriers are now legally obliged to submit to Irish customs when transporting goods from Great Britain into Ireland. Lorries arriving in Ireland from Great Britain have faced new checks since 1 January On Thursday night the Irish Revenue Commissioners said it recognised that ""some businesses are experiencing difficulties on lodging their safety and security ENS declarations"". It said that in response it was providing a ""temporary easement"" which would allow an ENS to be produced without all the normally required information. An Irish government spokesperson said it is ""absolutely essential that Ireland fulfils its obligations as a member of the EU and that we protect the integrity of the single market and the customs union"". ""We appreciate that the new requirements and customs formalities present significant challenges and impose additional burdens on businesses."" Meanwhile Stena, the ferry company, said it was cancelling a dozen sailings between Wales and Ireland next week due to ""a decline in freight volumes during the first week of Brexit.""

"Fashion student Mhari Thurston-Tyler posted an advert for the ""crop top"" (right) on Depop after she says she found some discarded Chiltern Railways seat covers (like those on the left) A fashion student has been warned not to sell prohibited items on the clothes app, Depop, after she posted an advert for a top made from a train seat cover. Mhari Thurston-Tyler made the bandeau out of a Chiltern Railways seat cover designed to promote social distancing during the coronavirus pandemic. The 20-year-old sold the top for Â£15 but later refunded her customer and took the advert down. Depop said the item ""clearly violates our terms of service"". The app for buying and selling second-hand clothes said the sale of stolen goods was banned - but Ms Thurston-Tyler denied stealing. She told BBC News she found two of the blue seat covers ""balled up on the floor"" outside Marylebone station in London in September. Ms Thurston-Tyler, who is a fashion student at Central Saint Martins, re-sewed one of the covers to make it fit her, before deciding to advertise the second cover on Depop. ""I have no money at the moment so decided to put the second one on Depop to see if anyone would buy it,"" she said, adding that the app had become her main source of income as she has struggled to find other work during the pandemic. ""I have to resort to little things like this to make ends meet, to pay the bills."" Ms Thurston-Tyler's advert went viral on social media after being shared byDepop Drama's Instagram,externalandTwitter,externalaccounts. Mhari Thurston-Tyler said she has been unable to find a job during the coronavirus pandemic and sells clothes on Depop ""to make ends meet"" In the advert, Ms Thurston-Tyler models the seat cover and describes it as a ""social distancing crop"", adding: ""Got a few of these can do different sizes."" Ms Thurston-Tyler, from Kenilworth in Warwickshire, said a Depop customer paid her Â£15 and ordered a crop top ""in extra small"". But realising she should not be making money out of Chiltern Railways' property, Ms Thurston-Tyler refunded the customer 15 minutes later and took the advert down shortly afterwards. ""I didn't steal it but I understand it's not right to re-sell it,"" she said. 'I made Â£1,265 selling my clothes second-hand' Can pre-loved clothes make fast fashion sustainable? A Depop spokesperson said Ms Thurston-Tyler would be banned from the platform if she listed any other prohibited goods. ""We explicitly prohibit the sale of illegal and unlawful content on the app, including any stolen goods,"" they said. ""This item clearly violates our terms of service, but as it has been removed by the seller and is no longer for sale on the platform, we will not be taking immediate steps to ban this user."" Ms Thurston-Tyler said she hopes to make her own line of crop tops with the words ""children railways"" on the design, while ""the hype"" of the viral moment continues. Chiltern Railways said it has been using the social distancing ""seat sashes"" since the beginning of the UK's Covid epidemic. A spokeswoman added: ""Whilst we appreciate this new take on railway memorabilia, these items are there to help customers travel with confidence and we would respectfully ask that they are left in place.""

"Stormont ministers have clashed over the planned school transfer test scheduled for next month. Sinn FÃ©in, SDLP and Alliance ministers argued the test run by the Association for Quality Education (AQE) should not go ahead due to the Covid-19 crisis. DUP leader and First Minister Arlene Foster, who chaired the meeting, rejected a call to put it to a vote. It was agreed that Education Minister Peter Weir would present a paper on the issue at a future meeting. The exchanges at the executive have been described as ""tense"" by some observers. Speaking on Friday evening, Mrs Foster said it was ""about parental choice"" and if parents wished to pursue academic selection, it was ""a legal route"". She said ""using Covid as an excuse"" to try and get rid of academic selection, was ""very, very wrong"". Mrs Foster said it was important to prevent the misuse of the executive's any-other-business function, and ""that is why today's vote could not happen"". ""Other parties wanted it to happen,"" she said. Mrs Foster said Stormont rules prevented an executive vote on stopping February's transfer test from going ahead ""If you allowed that to happen, then any majority of ministers could come along, and raise any sort of issue without having looked at the policy implications, or the procedures."" The attempt during the meeting at Stormont to halt the test was opposed by DUP ministers, who accused others of using the coronavirus crisis to attack grammar schools which use it. The ministers who wanted the test to be cancelled insisted their position was not linked to the wider debate about academic selection in Northern Ireland. The issue was raised during the any-other-business section of the meeting and First Minister Mrs Foster said that Stormont rules prevented a vote on substantive matters discussed during that time. Later Sinn FÃ©in minister Deirdre Hargey said: ""Unfortunately there was a decision taken today by some not to allow a vote to take place on this issue. ""I feel there would have been parties that would have clearly backed my position and understand the concerns around this. ""I do see that some of the grammar schools under AQE have moved, in not going ahead with academic selection. I commend the leadership that they have shown. I hope that others can follow in that leadership."" The transfer test has long been a controversial issue, with some political parties opposing its use Meanwhile, four grammar schools, Royal School Dungannon, Belfast Royal Academy, Victoria College and Campbell College have said they will not be using the AQE test to admit pupils this year. However Campbell College said it is obliged to host an AQE test if it goes ahead. Strabane Academy had already announced on Wednesday that it would not facilitate the additional test and would instead apply contingency criteria. There has been controversy throughout this week about whether the transfer test should go ahead as lockdown restrictions tightened in Northern Ireland. It is used by the majority of Northern Ireland grammar schools to select pupils. AQE plans to hold transfer test in February Post-primary transfer tests cancelled in NI The first in a series of tests was due to take place on Saturday but on Tuesday the exam providers said that would not happen. One provider cancelled its test while another - the AQE - said it wasmoving its test to a single sitting in February. On Friday, three of the 34 schools that normally use the test said they would not be proceeding with it this year. Royal School Dungannon (RSD) in County Tyrone, one of Northern Ireland's oldest grammar schools, told parents of primary seven pupils in the area that its governers had ""unanimously decided"" against using the test. Royal School Dungannon said its decision not to use the test was in children's ""best interests"" The school was established in 1614 and has about 650 pupils. In its letter to parents, the school said it still supported the principle of academic selection but would use its ""contingency admissions criteria"" for admitting pupils to year eight in September. ""Our most important consideration was giving certainty to P7 pupils and families during the Covid-19 public health crisis,"" said the school. ""The AQE test will therefore not take place at RSD on 27 February."" It added: ""We realise that the children have worked hard in preparing for the tests and that this is not how any of us would have wanted the transfer process to have worked this year."" It said its decision was ""in the best interests of the children's immediate welfare and their longer term prospects of success"". The school said its contingency admissions criteria would soon be available on its website. Victoria College said AQE would contact with parents about alternative testing arrangements Some grammar schools have already published criteriafor how they would admit pupils if the transfer test does not take place. Two Belfast schools have also pulled out of using the test. Victoria College said it ""did not consider it appropriate"" to run academic selection this year in the interests of the ""safety, health and wellbeing of parents, pupils and staff"". ""We understand fully that this is an emotive and divisive issue and that whilst this news will be welcomed by some it will cause anxiety for others,"" a letter from the school board read. The school said it would review its contingency admissions criteria and publish it ""in due course"". Belfast Royal Academy has also decided against using the test this year, saying it hoped the move would ""alleviate any further anxiety"" for children and their parents. The school said it would publish its contingency admissions criteria on Monday.

"Kelvin Hopkins, 79, has denied sexual harassment allegations A former Labour MP has quit the party before disciplinary proceedings against him concerning sexual harassment could be concluded, Labour has said. Kelvin Hopkins was suspended by the party in 2017 after a Labour activist, Ava Etemadzadeh, accused him of inappropriate physical contact. Ms Etemadzadeh said the ex-MP's exit from the party was ""disappointing"". The BBC has attempted to contact Mr Hopkins, 79, for a response, but he has previously denied the accusations. A Labour spokesperson said it ""takes all complaints of sexual harassment extremely seriously and they are fully investigated in line with our rules and procedures, and any appropriate disciplinary action is taken. ""We are disappointed that the party's disciplinary processes did not reach a conclusion due to Kelvin Hopkins' decision to resign his membership,"" they added. ""We are establishing an independent process to investigate complaints, including sexual harassment, to ensure complainants can feel confident that in coming forward they will be heard and get the justice they deserve."" Mr Hopkins, who first won the seat of Luton North from the Conservatives in 1997, stood down ahead of the 2019 election - a decision, he said, which was to do with his wife's health, not the accusations. He had originally been referred to the party's National Constitutional Committee following the allegations in 2017 and had expressed frustration at the length of time the hearing was taking. Responding to his decision to leave the party, Ms Etemadzadeh tweeted: ""This is very disappointing news. I hope Keir Starmer listens to my concerns and fixes this broken system.""

"The band recently became a trio (left-right): Leigh-Anne Pinnock, Jade Thirlwall and Perrie Edwards Little Mix have risen to top the top of UK singles chart after Christmas songs released their grip on the top 40. Sweet Melody has become the band's fifth number one, three months after it was released - and will be their last with Jesy Nelson, who quit last year. The 29-year-oldsaid in Decemberthat nine years in the girl group had taken ""a toll on her mental health"". Little Mix's victory is part of a huge chart upheaval, after 56 Christmas songs dropped out of the top 100. Among them was last week's number one, Wham's Last Christmas, which set a new record for the biggest-ever fall from the top. The festive ballad has now left the chart altogether. The previous record-holder - Three Lions, by The Lightning Seeds with Frank Skinner and David Baddiel - fell from number one to 96 after England crashed out of the World Cup in 2018. Sweet Melody has risen from number nine to number one this week, giving Little Mix their first chart-topper since Shout Out To My Ex in 2016. Jade Thirlwall told BBC Radio 1 the milestone was particularly important because it was ""the last single we did as a four with Jesy"". ""And it's even more special that now, going into 2021 as a three, we've got the first number one,"" she added. Allow YouTube content? This article contains content provided by Google YouTube.

Dua Lipa's Levitating jumped 63 places to number five, reclaiming a position it last held on 3 December; and Tate McRae's You Broke Me First rocketed from number 74 to nine. In total, there were 39 new entries or re-entries in the top 75. In the album chart, Taylor Swift's Evermore returned to number one, four weeks after its surprise pre-Christmas release, while companion album Folklore climbed to number 12. Meanwhile, Harry Styles' Fine Line reached a new chart peak at number two following the release of a video for his latest single Treat People With Kindness, which sees him dance with Fleabag's Phoebe Waller-Bridge. Lewis Capaldi's Divinely Uninspired To A Hellish Extent - the UK's biggest-selling album of both 2019 and 2020 - also climbed to number six, notching up its 86th week in the top 10.

"Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said it is ""excellent news"" that a third coronavirus vaccine has been approved for use in the UK. It is made by US company Moderna and works in a similar way to the Pfizer one already being offered on the NHS. The UK has pre-ordered 17 million doses of the Moderna vaccine - 10 million more than planned - but supplies are not expected to arrive until spring. It is the last Covid vaccine with final trial data published. There are hundreds still in development, with some expected to report findings in the near future. Around 1.5 million people in the UK have had at least one dose of a Covid vaccine so far, with either the Pfizer or AstraZeneca vaccines already approved by UK regulators. That figure includes almost a quarter of those aged over 80 in England - people at highest risk of severe illness or death from the virus. How will the UK vaccinate millions of people? When will you be eligible for a Covid vaccine? Vaccines are being given to the most vulnerable first, as set out in a list of nine high-priority groups, covering around 30 million people in the UK. This video can not be played Vaccine Deployment Minister Nadhim Zahawi welcomed the approval of the Moderna jab The prime minister has said the aim is to vaccinate 15 million people in the UK by mid-February, including care homes residents and staff, frontline NHS staff, everyone over 70 and those who are clinically extremely vulnerable. Health and Social Care Secretary Matt Hancock said: ""This is further great news and another weapon in our arsenal to tame this awful disease."" The UK had originally ordered 7 million doses of the Moderna jab, but has increased this to get even more people immunised as quickly as possible. In total, the UK has now ordered 367 million doses of vaccines to protect against Covid-19. Nadhim Zahawi, vaccine deployment minister, said: ""The NHS is pulling out all the stops to vaccinate those most at risk as quickly as possible, with over 1,000 vaccination sites live across the UK by the end of the week to provide easy access to everyone, regardless of where they live. ""The Moderna vaccine will be a vital boost to these efforts and will help us return to normal faster."" This video can not be played Covid vaccine safety: How does a vaccine get approved? The Moderna vaccine, an RNA vaccine like Pfizer's, injects part of the virus's genetic code in order to provoke an immune response. It requires temperatures of around -20C for shipping - similar to a normal freezer. In comparison, the Pfizer/BioNTech one requires temperatures closer to -75C, making transport logistics much more difficult. The AstraZeneca jab is easier to store and distribute, as it can be kept at normal fridge temperature. All of these vaccines require a second booster shot, but a first dose is likely to be given to as many people as possible. In trials with more than 30,000, the Moderna vaccine offered nearly 95% protection from severe Covid. No vaccine is 100% effective and it takes time for protection to build. For all of the Covid vaccines, we still do not know how long immunity will last. People who have received a coronavirus vaccine should continue to follow social distancing rules to protect themselves and others. EU and US regulators have already approved the Moderna vaccine.

"Harley Watson's mother Jo described him as a ""kind, caring, selfless, intelligent and comical young man"" A man who killed a 12-year-old boy by driving into schoolchildren in a ""deliberate"" hit and run has been detained in a secure hospital. Harley Watson died after he was hit by a car outside Debden Park High School in Loughton, Essex, on 2 December 2019. Terence Glover, 52,pleaded guilty to manslaughter by diminished responsibilityat an earlier hearing. He also admitted 10 counts of attempted murder and has been detained under the Mental Health Act indefinitely. At the sentencing hearing at Snaresbrook Crown Court, Harley's mother Jo described her son as a ""kind, caring, selfless, intelligent and comical young man"". He was hit by Glover's Ford Ka as he left school with friends and died later in Whipps Cross University Hospital. Terence Glover has been sentenced indefinitely under the Mental Health Act Christine Agnew, prosecuting, said eye-witnesses saw Glover's car ""ploughing through and hitting children from behind"". She said he ""deliberately mounted the pavement... and drove directly at a group of people, mostly children, intending to kill them"". Glover, previously of Newmans Lane, Loughton, also pleaded guilty to the attempted murder of 23-year-old Raquel Jimeno and six boys and three girls aged between 12 and 16 who were outside the school. The crash happened outside Debden Park High School The court heard he suffered from paranoid schizophrenia and medical experts agreed his ""significant"" mental illness ""provided an explanation for his conduct"".

Kwasi Kwarteng replaces him as business secretary while Anne-Marie Trevelyan becomes the new energy minister. The government says a successful summit will be critical if the UK wants to meet the objectives set out by the Paris Agreement and reduce global emissions. The event had originally been scheduled for November 2020 but was delayed by a year due to Covid-19. Sharma 'overloaded' to juggle UN summit role 2020 in a dead heat for warmest year on record Why 2021 could be turning point for tackling climate change The BBC's political correspondent Jessica Parker said the decision to move Alok Sharma wasn't a surprise and would be seen as a recognition of the need to free him up to do more of the crucial diplomatic leg-work required. SomeMPs had previously warnedthat Mr Sharma lacked the ""bandwidth"" to head the conference alongside his cabinet job, especially given the strains on business due to the pandemic. In his new role, which is based in the Cabinet Office, Mr Sharma's will remain a member of Boris Johnson's top team but be focused solely on coordinating global action to tackle climate change Boris Johnson chose Mr Sharma to head the event after ex-minister Claire O'Neill was ousted from the position in the summer of 2019. She later condemned what she called broken promises and backsliding on climate commitments. Former Conservative PM David Cameron turned down the chance to head the conference and ex-Foreign Secretary Lord Hague was also involved in discussions. Mr Sharma's move will be welcomed by climate campaigners, who worried he was over-stretched running a frantically busy department while also orchestrating the most important climate meeting on Earth. Many of these summits - known as COPs - yielded little because the leadership was poor. The French produced a triumphant agreement in the 2015 Paris COP after mustering the mighty force of French diplomacy. Mr Sharma is reported to accept that he now needs to concentrate full time on the challenge. He will need subtle diplomatic skills, a mastery of detail and the stamina of an ox as he attempts to corral world leaders into agreement on curbing emissions faster. He'll also need 100% support from the PM. The greatest obstacle to action - Donald Trump - will soon disappear from the scene, and with China making bold promises, the COP has potential. But politicians have been so slow to act that some key tipping points in the climate might already have been breached. Reflecting on his new role, Mr Sharma said: ""The biggest challenge of our time is climate change and we need to work together to deliver a cleaner, greener world and build back better for present and future generations. ""Through the UK's Presidency of COP26 we have a unique opportunity, working with friends and partners around the world, to deliver on this goal."" Richard Black, senior associate at the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit (ECIU) said: ""Allowing Alok Sharma to focus full-time on his COP26 role is a sensible decision, not least as it signals the government's commitment to ensuring that the summit is a success. Kwasi Kwarteng was succeed Mr Sharma as business secretary ""With the election of Joe Biden as the next US President and China's recent carbon neutrality pledge, the diplomatic opportunities have opened up for more ambitious action on climate change. Mr Sharma's job will be to seize them."" And ex-cabinet minister Amber Rudd, who led the UK delegation at the Paris climate change conference, said the move showed the government ""recognises the importance and opportunity for a global agreement this year"". Responding to his new appointment, Mr Kwarteng said he was ""thrilled"" and pledged to help businesses through this period of ""extremely challenging circumstances"". The Spelthorne MP, who entered Parliament in 2010, has been energy minister since July 2019. Labour's shadow business secretary Ed Miliband said Mr Kwarteng had ""a massive task"" in providing business with ""a plan to help them through this year, not the inadequate sticking plaster measures we have seen"". He welcomed the decision to make Mr Sharma's COP role full time. ""It's absolutely crucial that the full political, diplomatic and strategic resources of government are now directed to the most ambitious outcome at Glasgow, which is a 1.5 degree deal."" 2020 in a dead heat for warmest year on record Green body gives verdict on UK's climate policies At least 10 confirmed dead in Los Angeles wildfires What's the latest on the LA fires, and what caused them?

"Face masks are no longer legally required in Welsh shops The last Covid restrictions are set to end in Wales on Monday after 26 months. The wearing of face masks will no longer be legally required in health and social care services from Monday 30 May. It will be the first time there will be no Covid restrictions in Wales since the first lockdown in March 2020. The country is currently atalert level zero,external, the lowest tier of Covid rules, with numbers testing positive having fallen in recent weeks. The UK's last remaining Covid restrictions New Zealand to scrap some Covid vaccine mandates The lowest set of restrictions since the start of the pandemic. We were last in alert level zero at Christmas. Under it, most curbs to our daily life have been removed, and all businesses have been allowed to reopen. Self-isolation rules did still apply, but were scrapped from 28 March. It is no longer a legal requirement but people are still strongly recommended to use face coverings in any health setting to protect the most vulnerable. The Welsh government said the NHS continued to experience ""emergency and pandemic pressures"". Since 22 December, those identified as being a close contact of someone who tests positive for Covid-19 in Wales have not had to self-isolate automatically, if they are fully vaccinated, aged between five and 18, or participating in a vaccine clinical trial. Instead, the Welsh government strongly advises them to take lateral flow tests for seven days as a precautionary measure. Children under five do not need to isolate and are not required to take a PCR test or do lateral flow tests. Since 28 January, people who have tested positive must isolate for a minimum of five full days, with two negative lateral flow tests required on days five and six. Until then, the self-isolation period was seven days,down from the 10 days it was previously, with negative lateral flow tests needed on days six and seven. The Welsh government put the measures in place on 26 December to protect customers and staff in businesses The Welsh government has urged people to take lateral flow tests before socialising, shopping or visiting people and not to go out if it is positive. It advised meeting outdoors where possible and to make sure indoor meetings are well ventilated. People, it said, should leave at least a day between social events. From 26 December, groups of no more than six people were allowed to meet in pubs, cinemas and restaurants in Wales, with licensed premises having to offer table service only, and face masks worn, along with contact tracing details collected. But under the Welsh government announcement, all of this changed on 28 January. The rule of six was scrapped, meaning people can go to the pub with whoever they like, can go to the bar for a drink, and social distancing has ended. People are also able to be served at bars again, as table service only rules were scrapped. While wearing a face mask in a pub or bar is no longer required by law, the Welsh government has advised staff and customers to wear them indoors, when not eating, drinking or dancing. Limits on indoor or outdoor event numbers were lifted on 7 August and remain the same Limits on indoor or outdoor event numbers were lifted on 7 August. For important life events such as weddings, civil partnerships, funerals and wakes, the numbers will be determined by the ability of the venue to manage social distancing and other reasonable measures. All guests will need to take a lateral flow test. People attending weddings, civil partnerships or alternative wedding ceremonies or receptions, no longer have to wear face coverings by law under alert level zero. The Welsh government advised people to wear face coverings indoors when not eating, drinking or dancing. You can, and international travel is allowed, although local rules and quarantine will apply. On 25 January 2022, theWelsh government stopped advising people against travelling abroad for holidaysfor the first time since the start of the pandemic. Nightclubs were closed from 26 December, but under the four-stage plan, they have been allowed to open since 28 January, when Wales moved to alert level zero. Covid passes were scrapped on 18 February for nightclubs, along with cinemas, theatres and other large events. As cases continued to remain low, sports fans were allowed to return to events From 15 January the number of people allowed to attend an outdoor event rose from 50 to 500. On 21 January all outdoor activities moved to alert level zero, with no limits on the number of people who can take part and crowds were able to return to sporting events. Gyms, swimming pools, leisure centres, community centres and fitness facilities are open Pupils returned later than planned for the start of the new spring term in January. From 18 February, they were no longer required to wear face coverings and schools could decide their own rules. Working from home is no longer law in Wales A legal restriction to work from home unless unavoidable, with Â£60 fines for anyone who did not comply and had no reasonable excuse, was scrapped on 28 January. You have been able to travel anywhere in the UK since 12 April 2021, subject to restrictions in force in the other nations. It also means people from other parts of the UK can come here. All holiday accommodation was able to fully reopen from 17 May.

"The Welsh Government is in discussions about bringing in ""more visible"" coronavirus regulations. Stricter enforcement of coronavirus rules could return to supermarkets in Wales, Mark Drakeford has said. The first minister said he had heard concerns from people ""expressing anxiety"" about a lack of ""visible protections"" in supermarkets. The Welsh Government is now in talks with stores about social-distancing measures. Mr Drakeford said he wanted to see stores policed as they were during the first lockdown. Among the measures previously used was a strict limit of the numbers of people allowed in a store however Mr Drakeford said people were worried the rules ""don't appear to be there this time"". ""Given the fact the new variant is so much easier to catch... we are looking at supermarkets and other places where people leave their homes, to make sure they are organised in a way that keeps their staff and customers safe,"" he said. Supermarket websites struggle amid new lockdown Meat factories warn Covid absences could hit supplies Supermarkets try to calm food shortage fears amid border chaos He said previously sanitising arrangements had been ""very visible"", one-way markings were prominently displayed, regular reminders were announced to customers and staff were also posted at the front entrance of supermarkets ""That person was carefully controlling the numbers of people going in, to make sure that they were no more than a certain number of people in the store at any one time,"" he said. ""There was somebody directing people to the checkout, to make sure people weren't queuing next to each other over prolonged periods, and markings on the floor so people kept at a two-metre distance"". However the first minister said some of those measures are no longer as apparent to people. ""I want to make sure that those visible signs of the protections that are being offered to the public and the shop workers are in place again."" Federation of Small Businesses Wales said has called for clarity on what support would be available and the possible new measures required of shops. Policy Chair, Ben Francis, said: ""We've already asked to see more information on the technical data that informs the decisions that Welsh Government are making. ""It seems clear that businesses will require funding support for longer than was originally anticipated if they are to survive this troubling period. ""Welsh Government should urgently give clarity on what additional funding will be made available to support businesses beyond this next three week period to allow them to plan.""

"This video can not be played Covid lockdown: 'This is why we say to you do not come out' People are being warned about breaking lockdown restrictions after the police got stuck in snow due to rule-breakers. A car driving on Moel Famau hill, Flintshire, despite roadblocks, skidded off the road on Thursday night, with officers deployed to help the passengers. However, they then became stuck and had to call mountain rescuers. Ayellow warning for snow and ice,externalhas been issued by the Met Office for all of Wales, until midnight on Friday. Police said: ""This is why we say to you do not come out."" On a video posted on Twitter, an officer for the North Wales Police Rural Crime Team warned people about the consequences of breaking the rules. ""It is now involving two agencies, two police vehicles, two mountain rescue vehicles and three police officers and the casualty."" Snowdonia car parks to shut after Covid breaches Beacons visitors travel 180 miles despite Covid rules Crowds head for Brecon Beacons as snow falls Rob Taylor from North Wales Police Rural Crime Team said the person who was driving the car, which travelled 200m when it lost control was ""very, very lucky to be alive and escape uninjured"". ""We've been having problems with people lately flouting the law and going where they shouldn't be going,"" he said. ""People have been going through them for various reasons whether that's a walk or sledge and gathering in large groups. So we have been paying attention. ""This issue that was highlighted perfectly yesterday where someone's gone there thinking it's okay to flout the law. They get themselves in trouble and cause an emergency response from police and actually put those police officers' lives at risk. ""Their actions can really affect many people."" Snow and ice warnings are in place for all of Wales The snow warning for Friday said 5cm of snow could also fall on hills and mountains, with a widespread frost forecast for the morning. Road agencies said driving conditions on the A55 in Flintshire were difficult, with snow on Rhuallt Hill. One lane on the expressway has been closed eastbound between Pentre Halkyn and Northop following a crash. Roads have also been closed in Denbighshire following the heavy snow. Snow on the Denbigh Moors The Met Office warned there was a risk of slips and falls with sleet and snow predicted to fall on to already-frozen ground, creating icy patches. Forecasters said that while snow was likely to fall on hills and mountains, flurries could be seen elsewhere, but this was likely to ""be slight and temporary"".

"This video can not be played Senior doctor Amanda Farrow said the hospital faced ""unrelenting"" pressure A nurse felt ""overwhelming fear"" as 13 ambulances queued at her hospital's A&E department - in the Welsh region currently hardest hit by Covid deaths. To date Cwm Taf Morgannwg health board, which runs Royal Glamorgan Hospital, has reported 1,091 deaths of patients with coronavirus. BBC Wales was granted access to A&E at the hospital in Rhondda Cynon Taf. Senior doctor Amanda Farrow said the whole hospital had faced ""unrelenting"" pressure last Saturday. Sarah Fogarasy was the senior nurse on duty as 13 ambulances queued up outside her A&E department Senior A&E nurse Sarah Fogarasy, who was on shift as the ambulances arrived, said there was no capacity at the unit - a situation that left her wanting ""to leave"". ""We had to escalate it to our site manager and deputy head of nursing who were liaising with the executive team on call,"" she said. ""And then it got to 13 patients outside - I had no capacity in this unit, no resuscitation capacity, no capacity to put a patient on CPAP [continuous positive airway pressure] should they require that and no physical areas to put a patient in. ""It was overwhelming."" On Saturday, 13 ambulances queued outside the hospital's A&E department She said she found it hard to keep going. ""This bit makes me quite emotionalâ¦ for the first time I was sat trying to coordinate this department and I had that overwhelming fear that I just wanted to leave,"" Ms Fogarasy continued. ""I was just - 'I'm done. I'm done with this'... and it's scary, it fills you full of fear when you have got 13 ambulances outside, queuing around the carpark. Where do you go from that?"" She said it was the team that kept her going: ""I started looking around to all the staff working tirelessly and just trying to remember what we're here for and why I became a nurse. ""I know it sounds soppy but it's literally the humanitarian effort that has gone into [fighting] this pandemic that has kept people going. ""It's the sheer determination and guts of the staff working in these times that is so powerful, that keeps the shift going."" Emergency Medicine Consultant Amanda Farrow said it was a ""very emotional time for everyone"" Dr Farrow, emergency medicine consultant, said staffing and bed numbers were of particular concern. ""In the emergency department the challenge we have is with regards to flow, so that is our daily challenge,"" she explained. ""And we say it's like playing a game of Tetris trying to work out which patient you can put where."" Staff reported feeling overwhelmed as they work through the second Covid wave She said the second wave of the virus had also seen more staff off sick with Covid and isolating - with some becoming very ill. ""We've had staff in as patients and one of my colleagues - I saw them when they were critically ill and ended up going to intensive care,"" continued Dr Farrow. ""So it's very emotional time for everyone as well you know, looking after the sick patients and looking after your colleagues. ""There's a level of anxiety still around -  will you be the next person to get this disease?"" She said although fewer people were attending A&E, they were seeing more people arriving by ambulance and presenting with more complex needs. ""The group of patients we are seeing this time I think is different, we're definitely having more younger people with Covid that are becoming sick, the volume is very high in the community. ""I think people are afraid of come into the hospital as well, so there are still quite a lot of patients who leave it maybe a bit too late before they're seeking hospital attention."" Speaking from her intensive care bed, Helen Whatmore said she was extremely grateful to staff Helen Whatmore, 45, from Beddau, has been hospital since early December after developing Covid symptoms. Speaking from her intensive care bed, she said she had been unwell in February so assumed she had already caught the virus. ""I honestly didn't believe it was as bad until I caught [Covid] this time,"" she said. ""This time it's absolutely knocked the socks off me. It's nearly killed me. ""A friend of mine passed away as I came into hospital and I came down very rapidly with Covid, kidney problems and pneumonia."" She said she was grateful for the care she had received: ""The nurses are coming in [working] all shifts, they're fighting for your loved ones, from the time they enter right until the time they leave, then they're changing over and doing the same again. ""People are passing awayâ¦ how much more have they got to do? We're asking them to protect our children and our families. Why are we not protecting them ourselves? Saving our families and our own children."" At least 10 confirmed dead in Los Angeles wildfires What's the latest on the LA fires, and what caused them?

"Jessica Allen (left) and Eliza Moore are now sticking to walks nearer their homes Two women have described how they were surrounded by police, read their rights and fined Â£200 each after driving five miles to take a walk. The women were also told the hot drinks they had brought along were not allowed as they were ""classed as a picnic"". Guidance for the current lockdown says people can travel for exercise as long as it is in their ""local area"". The police force involved, Derbyshire Police, said driving for exercise was ""not in the spirit"" of lockdown. One of the would-be walkers, Jessica Allen, assumed ""someone had been murdered"" when she arrived at Foremark Reservoir on Wednesday afternoon. Foremark Reservoir is five miles away from where Jessica Allen and Eliza Moore live ""As we drove in there was a police van, a police car, and there were loads of police there,"" said Ms Allen, who lives in Ashby-de-la-Zouch in Leicestershire. ""I genuinely thought someone had been murdered; the place is normally so quiet. The next thing, my car is surrounded. I got out of my car thinking 'There's no way they're coming to speak to us'. Straight away they start questioning us. ""One of them started reading my rights and I was looking at my friend thinking 'This must be a joke'. ""I said we had come in separate cars, even parked two spaces away and even brought our own drinks with us. He said 'You can't do that as it's classed as a picnic'."" Seal sightseeing couple fined for 130-mile trip What can police do to enforce lockdown rules? Covid 'out of control in London', Sadiq Khan says Her friend, Eliza Moore, said she was ""stunned at the time"" so did not challenge police and gave her details so they could send a fixed penalty notice. ""Just seeing a police officer anyway is quite scary for some people and we were really not expecting to be approached and to be told we were doing something wrong,"" she said. ""We don't want to get away with it if we have broken the rule, but it seems a bit unfair that you can be fined on something that's so vague."" Guidance issued by the Cabinet Office,externalstates that people can leave their homes for exercise but should not travel outside their ""local area"". However, the actuallegislation does not specify a maximum distance,externalthat people are allowed to travel for exercise. Both the guidance and legislation state people can exercise with one other person, as Jessica Allen and Eliza Moore did. Human rights barrister Adam Wagner said: ""There is no law against travelling to exercise. The guidance is not legally binding and the police have no power to enforce it unless it is reflected in the lockdown regulations which in this case it is not."" Derbyshire Police said: ""It is up to each individual officer on a case-by-case basis to decide what is reasonable as the legislation does not proscribe a distance."" The BBC contacted the Cabinet Office, Home Office, College of Policing and National Police Chiefs' Council to ask for clarification over what they define as ""local area"" in relation to exercise. None could clarify this. However, the College of Policing said: ""In overall terms police officers across England and Wales will be using their discretion and professional judgement about whether or not someone has a reasonable excuse for travelling for exercise and being outside the place where they are living."" Jessica Allen (right) said walking at the reservoir benefits her mental health during lockdown Ms Allen said she is taking the pandemic ""very seriously"" as her brother is a doctor working on a Covid ward in London, and her parents have both had coronavirus. She said she drove to the reservoir as she knew it would be less crowded than near her house. ""I'm self-employed but my business is closed and I'm trying to fill my time,"" she said. ""I suffer from anxiety and when you go by the water you feel so much better. The only thing I've got to look forward to is planning a walk with my friend."" Ms Allen said the experience was ""very intimidating"" and had left her feeling scared of police in general. ""I was so shook up afterwards,"" she said. ""The fact they read my rights. I thought 'Am I going to prison for going on a walk?' ""I'm not a criminal but we were treated as if we were criminals and it really made me feel for those people who are wrongly arrested and questioned by police, because it wasn't a nice situation to be in."" Jessica Allen, whose brother is a doctor on a Covid ward, went to the reservoir as she knew it would be quiet Derbyshire Police said in a statement: ""Driving to a location - where exercise could easily have been taken closer to a person's home - is clearly not in the spirit of the national effort to reduce our travel, reduce the possible spread of the disease and reduce the number of deaths. ""Each officer will use their professional judgement on a case-by-case basis, however, people should expect to be challenged and understand the clear reasons why they may be asked about their movements given the critical situation the NHS currently finds itself in."" Andrew Bridgen, MP for North West Leicestershire, said he regarded the reservoir as a local area. He tweeted:,external""I'm concerned that my constituents are facing fines from Derbyshire Police for taking exercise in what I would class as the local area. ""It is important that common sense is used when enforcing guidelines, and a fine rather than issuing guidance appears to be rather over zealous."" Derbyshire Police has also been giving fixed penalty notices to people who visit Calke Abbey and Elvaston Castle. Fixed penalty notices have been given to people who visit Calke Abbey, a National Trust property One man said his parents were given a fixed penalty notice after driving seven miles to Calke Abbey from their home in Whitwick, Leicestershire. ""Upon approaching the park there was a team of police officers so my parents decided to pull in and check that no laws were being broken,"" he said. ""Immediately they were hit with a Â£200 fine. When my parents said that they weren't aware this was too far and they'd go home immediately, the police officer simply said 'It's too late'."" Guidance from the College of Policing says officers shouldfollow the ""Four Es"" and only give fixed penalty notices as a last resort,external. When asked about this, Derbyshire Police said: ""The four Es are still in use, however, where there are cases of blatant breaches of the regulations then fines will be issued by officers."" During the first lockdown, the force wascriticised for releasing drone footage of people walking in the Peak District. Speaking at the time, Lord Sumption - a former Supreme Court judge -said it was ""disgraceful"" and ""shamed our policing traditions"".

"This video can not be played One floral tribute had Dame Barbara's photograph in the centre The funeral of EastEnders and Carry On actress Dame Barbara Windsor has taken place in London. Ross Kemp, who played her on-screen son in the soap, was among the 30 mourners and gave a reading, as did actor and friend Christopher Biggins. Dame Barbaradied in December at the age of 83, having had dementia. There were floral arrangements spelling Babs, The Dame and Saucy, and a mock pub sign showing her as The Queen Peggy in the style of the soap's Queen Vic. Dame Barbara played pub landlady Peggy Mitchell in EastEnders for more than two decades. A version of the EastEnders Queen Vic pub sign was painted in tribute Scott Mitchell, who was married to Dame Barbara for 20 years, was joined at Golders Green Crematorium by family and friends including comedians Matt Lucas and David Walliams. ""As Covid has denied so many of Barbara's family, friends and fans a chance to say farewell properly, I wanted to share the order of service to let people be a small part of it,"" Mr Mitchell told the PA news agency. ""My heart goes out to every family who have experienced the same restrictions at their loved ones' funerals."" Left-right: Christopher Biggins, Ross Kemp and David Walliams were among the mourners He added: ""I would again like to thank my family, friends, the media and the public for their incredible support and well wishes since Barbara's passing."" Dame Barbara's coffin was brought into the crematorium to sound of Frank Sinatra's On The Sunny Side Of The Street, and the service featured a recording of Sparrows Can't Sing from the actress's 1963 film of the same. It finished with the famous topless photo of Dame Barbara from the film Carry On Camping, alongside her quote: ""That picture will follow me to the end."" Long-time friend Anna Karen, who played Dame Barbara's on-screen sister Aunt Sal in EastEnders, also paid tribute during the service. The funeral was also attended by Loose Women's Jane Moore and EastEnders actor Jamie Borthwick. However, the numbers were limited due to coronavirus social distancing. Alzheimer's Research UK recently said it had seen a spike in donations since Dame Barbara's death, and a JustGiving page set up as a tribute to her and in aid of the charity has raised more than Â£150,000 (including Gift Aid). Mr Mitchell said that was ""beyond anything we may have dreamed of"". Follow us onFacebook,external, or on Twitter@BBCNewsEnts,external.

Mr Trump is facing calls for his removal from office after five people died when a mob of his supporters invaded Congress. The president was not fit to serve in the White House, Mr Biden said. But he said he would happy for Vice-President Mike Pence to attend the inauguration. The latest death is that of US Capitol Police officer Brian Sicknick, who succumbed to his injuries in hospital. The FBI and Washington police will jointly investigate his death, although they have not yet said whether it will be treated as murder. Wednesday's violence came hours after Mr Trump encouraged his supporters to fight against the election results as Congress was certifying Mr Biden's victory in the November vote. Under pressure, Mr Trump released a recorded statement late on Thursday condemning the storming of the US Capitol as a ""heinous attack"". It is highly unusual but not unprecedented: the last president to skip the inauguration of his successor was Andrew Johnson, in 1869. Mr Trump has now admitted defeat in the 3 November election and has promised a peaceful transfer of power. However, he has repeated baseless claims of widespread voter fraud. Meanwhile, House Democrats plan to introduce articles of impeachment next Monday accusing the outgoing president of incitement of insurrection. Nearly 160 House Democrats have signed on to the bill, which was drafted by congressmen Ted Lieu of California and David Cicilline of Rhode Island while they were sheltering in place during Wednesday's chaos at the Capitol. If the House votes to pass an impeachment, proceedings would move to the Senate. But there is so far no sign that the two-thirds of votes required to convict the president can be found in the Republican-controlled upper chamber. The White House responded in a statement: ""A politically motivated impeachment against a President with 12 days remaining in his term will only serve to further divide our great country."" House Speaker Nancy Pelosi previously said her preference was for Mr Trump to be removedusing the 25th Amendment, which allows the vice-president to step up if the president is unable to perform his duties owing to a mental or physical illness.

The terse message, posted on Twitter, will undercut the president's call for ""healing and reconciliation"" made in the White House video he released last night.

"The number of people in Scotland who have died within 28 days of testing positive for the virus now stands at 4,872 Scotland's hospitals have more Covid patients than ever before - with the number of deaths also ""distressingly high"", the first minister has said. The latest figures showed that the deaths of 93 people who had tested positive for the virus have been recorded in the past 24 hours. But the figure includes some people who died over Christmas and New Year. There were also 1,530 people in hospital with the virus, higher than the peak of 1,520 last April. Of these, 102 patients were in intensive care - with Ms Sturgeon saying the statistics showed the ""severity of the pressure"" that hospitals are facing. The 93 deaths recorded on Friday is the highest daily figure since the outbreak began - with the previous high being 84 on 15 April. How many Covid cases have there been in your area? Third Covid vaccine approved in the UK When will I be vaccinated against Covid? Travellers to UK will need to show negative test But Ms Sturgeon said the figure will ""undoubtedly include some people who died over the Christmas and New Year period and the delay in registration because of the bank holidays means that their deaths are only being reported today."" She added: ""To be clear, that is not more than 90 people who died yesterday. It will be people who have died over a period of time. ""That does not change the fact they are all individuals who have died and have died of Covid."" A further 2,309 people have tested positive for Covid-19, which was 8.1% of the tests carried out on Thursday and takes the total number of cases in Scotland to 146,024. The figures mean that the total number of people in Scotland who have died within 28 days of testing positive for the virus now stands at 4,872. The Scottish government has said it is concerned that too many people have not been following the ""stay at home"" rules that are in place across the whole of the mainland and some islands. It believes that more people are using the country's road and public transport networks than during the lockdown last spring. And it has warned that tougher restrictions could be needed to increase compliance with the travel restrictions. What are the latest Covid rules in Scotland? Ms Sturgeon told her daily briefing that the areas being looked at included non-essential click and collect shopping, further restrictions on takeaway food, non-essential construction and whether more people should be working from home. The first minister also confirmed that universities and colleges will not resume in-person teaching until at least the end of February. This means that students should stay at home rather than travelling back to their campus or accommodation. There will be exceptions for cases where remote study is not possible - for example for a student nurse or a doctor on a practical placement. And Ms Sturgeon said any students who have remained on campus will be ""fully supported"" by their institution. All of mainland Scotland was placed into level four restrictions from 26 December before additional measures, including closing schools to most pupils until at least the end of the month, was introduced on Tuesday. Scotland's interim chief medical officer, Dr Dave Caesar, insisted on Friday morning that coronavirus case numbers in January ""could have been worse"". He said the restrictions that were introduced on Boxing Day had helped to ""blunt the spike"" but warned that the country was ""not out of the woods yet"". Dr Caesar told the BBC'sGood Morning Scotlandprogramme: ""Our case numbers are high, but they're not as high as they could have been if we hadn't taken the measures that we undertook from Boxing Day. ""Our health system is under serious pressure but is coping. ""I hate to say it, but it could have been worse by this time in January. We're not out of the woods yet by any stretch of the imagination, but I suppose we're holding our own in very significantly challenging circumstances."" New Covid testing measures for international travellers are to be introduced New plans tomake international passengers test negative for Covid-19before travelling to Scotland and England have also been unveiled, with Ms Sturgeon saying she hoped the scheme could start by the end of next week. It will mean people arriving by plane, train or boat - including UK nationals - will have to take a test up to 72 hours before leaving the country they are travelling from. Prof Linda Bauld of Edinburgh University said the move was long overdue as the UK had ""really struggled from the beginning"" with limiting the impact of international travel on the pandemic. But she said the country should also consider introducing supervised quarantine for people arriving from overseas. LEVELS:What are the restrictions in your area?

"Jessica Allen (left) and Eliza Moore are now sticking to walks nearer their homes Two women have described how they were surrounded by police, read their rights and fined Â£200 each after driving five miles to take a walk. The women were also told the hot drinks they had brought along were not allowed as they were ""classed as a picnic"". Guidance for the current lockdown says people can travel for exercise as long as it is in their ""local area"". The police force involved, Derbyshire Police, said driving for exercise was ""not in the spirit"" of lockdown. One of the would-be walkers, Jessica Allen, assumed ""someone had been murdered"" when she arrived at Foremark Reservoir on Wednesday afternoon. Foremark Reservoir is five miles away from where Jessica Allen and Eliza Moore live ""As we drove in there was a police van, a police car, and there were loads of police there,"" said Ms Allen, who lives in Ashby-de-la-Zouch in Leicestershire. ""I genuinely thought someone had been murdered; the place is normally so quiet. The next thing, my car is surrounded. I got out of my car thinking 'There's no way they're coming to speak to us'. Straight away they start questioning us. ""One of them started reading my rights and I was looking at my friend thinking 'This must be a joke'. ""I said we had come in separate cars, even parked two spaces away and even brought our own drinks with us. He said 'You can't do that as it's classed as a picnic'."" Seal sightseeing couple fined for 130-mile trip What can police do to enforce lockdown rules? Covid 'out of control in London', Sadiq Khan says Her friend, Eliza Moore, said she was ""stunned at the time"" so did not challenge police and gave her details so they could send a fixed penalty notice. ""Just seeing a police officer anyway is quite scary for some people and we were really not expecting to be approached and to be told we were doing something wrong,"" she said. ""We don't want to get away with it if we have broken the rule, but it seems a bit unfair that you can be fined on something that's so vague."" Guidance issued by the Cabinet Office,externalstates that people can leave their homes for exercise but should not travel outside their ""local area"". However, the actuallegislation does not specify a maximum distance,externalthat people are allowed to travel for exercise. Both the guidance and legislation state people can exercise with one other person, as Jessica Allen and Eliza Moore did. Human rights barrister Adam Wagner said: ""There is no law against travelling to exercise. The guidance is not legally binding and the police have no power to enforce it unless it is reflected in the lockdown regulations which in this case it is not."" Derbyshire Police said: ""It is up to each individual officer on a case-by-case basis to decide what is reasonable as the legislation does not proscribe a distance."" The BBC contacted the Cabinet Office, Home Office, College of Policing and National Police Chiefs' Council to ask for clarification over what they define as ""local area"" in relation to exercise. None could clarify this. However, the College of Policing said: ""In overall terms police officers across England and Wales will be using their discretion and professional judgement about whether or not someone has a reasonable excuse for travelling for exercise and being outside the place where they are living."" Jessica Allen (right) said walking at the reservoir benefits her mental health during lockdown Ms Allen said she is taking the pandemic ""very seriously"" as her brother is a doctor working on a Covid ward in London, and her parents have both had coronavirus. She said she drove to the reservoir as she knew it would be less crowded than near her house. ""I'm self-employed but my business is closed and I'm trying to fill my time,"" she said. ""I suffer from anxiety and when you go by the water you feel so much better. The only thing I've got to look forward to is planning a walk with my friend."" Ms Allen said the experience was ""very intimidating"" and had left her feeling scared of police in general. ""I was so shook up afterwards,"" she said. ""The fact they read my rights. I thought 'Am I going to prison for going on a walk?' ""I'm not a criminal but we were treated as if we were criminals and it really made me feel for those people who are wrongly arrested and questioned by police, because it wasn't a nice situation to be in."" Jessica Allen, whose brother is a doctor on a Covid ward, went to the reservoir as she knew it would be quiet Derbyshire Police said in a statement: ""Driving to a location - where exercise could easily have been taken closer to a person's home - is clearly not in the spirit of the national effort to reduce our travel, reduce the possible spread of the disease and reduce the number of deaths. ""Each officer will use their professional judgement on a case-by-case basis, however, people should expect to be challenged and understand the clear reasons why they may be asked about their movements given the critical situation the NHS currently finds itself in."" Andrew Bridgen, MP for North West Leicestershire, said he regarded the reservoir as a local area. He tweeted:,external""I'm concerned that my constituents are facing fines from Derbyshire Police for taking exercise in what I would class as the local area. ""It is important that common sense is used when enforcing guidelines, and a fine rather than issuing guidance appears to be rather over zealous."" Derbyshire Police has also been giving fixed penalty notices to people who visit Calke Abbey and Elvaston Castle. Fixed penalty notices have been given to people who visit Calke Abbey, a National Trust property One man said his parents were given a fixed penalty notice after driving seven miles to Calke Abbey from their home in Whitwick, Leicestershire. ""Upon approaching the park there was a team of police officers so my parents decided to pull in and check that no laws were being broken,"" he said. ""Immediately they were hit with a Â£200 fine. When my parents said that they weren't aware this was too far and they'd go home immediately, the police officer simply said 'It's too late'."" Guidance from the College of Policing says officers shouldfollow the ""Four Es"" and only give fixed penalty notices as a last resort,external. When asked about this, Derbyshire Police said: ""The four Es are still in use, however, where there are cases of blatant breaches of the regulations then fines will be issued by officers."" During the first lockdown, the force wascriticised for releasing drone footage of people walking in the Peak District. Speaking at the time, Lord Sumption - a former Supreme Court judge -said it was ""disgraceful"" and ""shamed our policing traditions"".

On Friday, Mrs Pelosi said she had spoken to the top US military official, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, to prevent Mr Trump from accessing US nuclear codes. Separately, one of Mrs Pelosi's staff members revealed that a laptop had been stolen from her office during the mob invasion of Congress. This video can not be played Phone footage reveals chaotic scenes inside US Capitol Trump's announcement that he will not attend Joe Biden's inauguration, breaking with a long American tradition, should not come as a huge surprise. He only recently, and reluctantly, acknowledged his presidential defeat, after months of unfounded allegations that a landslide electoral victory had been stolen from him. The terse message, posted on Twitter, will undercut the president's call for ""healing and reconciliation"" made in the White House video he released last night. It suggests Trump, far from being at peace with his defeat, still harbours the kind of anger and resentment he has displayed in recent days. He will not graciously welcome the Bidens to Washington as part of his promised ""smooth, orderly and seamless transition of power"". He may not even be anywhere near Washington when they arrive. Instead, scripted Trump and Twitter Trump reveal two very different attitudes. Already, Trump has tweeted about the ""giant voice"" his supporters will continue to have. The question is whether Trump is writing a coda to his presidency or just clearing his throat.

"This video can not be played Trump calls for an 'orderly transition of power' to the Biden administration on January 20th US President Donald Trump has said he will not attend the inauguration of his successor, Joe Biden, on 20 January. ""To all of those who have asked, I will not be going to the Inauguration on January 20th,"" the president tweeted. The president-elect welcomed the news, calling Mr Trump's absence ""a good thing"". Mr Trump is facing calls for his removal from office after five people died when a mob of his supporters invaded Congress. The president was not fit to serve in the White House, Mr Biden said. But he said he would happy for Vice-President Mike Pence to attend the inauguration. The latest death is that of US Capitol Police officer Brian Sicknick, who succumbed to his injuries in hospital. The FBI and Washington police will jointly investigate his death, although they have not yet said whether it will be treated as murder. Wednesday's violence came hours after Mr Trump encouraged his supporters to fight against the election results as Congress was certifying Mr Biden's victory in the November vote. Under pressure, Mr Trump released a recorded statement late on Thursday condemning the storming of the US Capitol as a ""heinous attack"". It is highly unusual but not unprecedented: the last president to skip the inauguration of his successor was Andrew Johnson, in 1869. Mr Trump has now admitted defeat in the 3 November election and has promised a peaceful transfer of power. However, he has repeated baseless claims of widespread voter fraud. Meanwhile, House Democrats plan to introduce articles of impeachment next Monday accusing the outgoing president of incitement of insurrection. Nearly 160 House Democrats have signed on to the bill, which was drafted by congressmen Ted Lieu of California and David Cicilline of Rhode Island while they were sheltering in place during Wednesday's chaos at the Capitol. If the House votes to pass an impeachment, proceedings would move to the Senate. But there is so far no sign that the two-thirds of votes required to convict the president can be found in the Republican-controlled upper chamber. The White House responded in a statement: ""A politically motivated impeachment against a President with 12 days remaining in his term will only serve to further divide our great country."" House Speaker Nancy Pelosi previously said her preference was for Mr Trump to be removedusing the 25th Amendment, which allows the vice-president to step up if the president is unable to perform his duties owing to a mental or physical illness. But there is no sign of the support from the vice-president and cabinet members needed to trigger this constitutional process.

"Heads are calling for limits to the number of pupils in school during lockdown in England, with attendance rates surging to 50% in some places. The two head teachers' unions, NAHT and ASCL, say the high numbers attending could hamper the fight against the virus. The Department for Education has widened the categories of vulnerable and key worker pupils who can attend. It is insisting that schools ensure all children who qualify can attend. The widened categories not only include vulnerable pupils and children of workers in critical occupations but also those who cannot access remote learning either because they do not have devices or space to study. Children of parents working on the Brexit arrangements are also included. Teachers have described streets around schools being packed with parents dropping off their children and almost all staff having to come in and work despite the lockdown. Heads say theyfear schools could be overwhelmed by children who do not have access to lap topsto learn remotely. Jessica Jane, a learning assistant at a school in Hampshire, told the BBC: ""I work in a primary school where we are having to bring in every single member of staff as the list of key-workers is vast in our area and over 50% of our children are attending. ""Our community school is not closed and streets are packed with parents morning and afternoon collecting their children from open schools."" She added: ""My colleagues and I are still being put at risk every single day as are our families."" A teacher from the Midlands who did not wish to be named said the number had risen from 10 pupils a day in the first lockdown to about 90 a day this week. ""We're talking just under to just over a third of the usual amount of pupils for our school here. ""The vast majority are key worker children, not vulnerable. ""I also know that other primary schools in our area have similar amounts of children in school - one neighbouring school in particular, which is only slightly larger than us, is estimating/averaging 100 to 160 children in school every day."" Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, called the lack of limits ""bizarre... in a week when the prime minister has told the nation that it is necessary to move schools to remote education in order to suppress coronavirus transmission"". ""We are hearing reports that attendance in some primary schools is in excess of 50% because of demand from critical workers and families with children classed as vulnerable under criteria which has been significantly widened,"" he said. ""We are urgently seeking clarification about the maximum number who should be in school while protecting public health. ""This seems completely illogical given the fact that the government has taken the drastic action of a full national lockdown precisely in order to limit contacts."" Paul Whiteman, general secretary of National Association of Head Teachers, said schools could not ""meet the demand created by government and reduce social mixing in the way the prime minister announced"". ""The government acknowledges that schools do play a role in the transmission of the virus. Therefore, there comes a point when occupancy levels might be so high that they work against the efforts to bring down infection rates in communities, as is the national aim. ""This could result in prolonging the amount of time pupils are away from the classroom, which we are all anxious to avoid."" A Department for Education spokesman said: ""Schools are open for vulnerable children and the children of critical workers. We expect schools to work with families to ensure all critical worker children are given access to a place if this is required. ""If critical workers can work from home and look after their children at the same time then they should do so, but otherwise this provision is in place to enable them to provide vital services. ""The protective measures that schools have been following throughout the autumn term remain in place to help protect staff and students, while the national lockdown helps reduce transmission in the wider community."" But Emma Knights, chief executive of the National Governance Association, reflected head teachers' concerns, saying between 40 and 60% of pupils were attending schools across England. ""The real problem is we have got two different national narratives going on,"" she said - with the prime minister saying ""stay at home"" but the DfE telling schools to take all eligible children who turn up. Dr Mary Bousted, joint general secretary of the National Education Union, said the government seemed unable to decide whether schools were safe or unsafe. Commenting on the latestCoronavirus Infection Survey from the Office for National Statistics,external, Dr Bousted, said: ""Let this data end their confusion. Schools are clearly driving infection amongst children, and then onto the wider community. ""This peaked on Christmas Day with one in every 27 secondary-age children and one in 40 primary-age children infected. ""In London this rises to one in 18 secondary pupils and one in 23 primary pupils. These figures are truly shocking and entirely the result of government negligence.""

Thank you for reading. The team was Alex Therrien, Mary O'Connor, Alexandra Fouche, Kevin Ponniah, Max Matza, Owen Amos, and James Clarke. We're pausing our live coverage of the coronavirus pandemic for today. It's been a busy day in the UK - here's a roundup of the day's top headlines: Richmond upon Thames was the one area in England not to see a rise in cases All but one of England's 315 local areas have seen a recent rise in coronavirus case rates, figures released today show. Richmond upon Thames, in south-west London, was the one exception, with a fall in infections. The figures, for the seven days to 4 January, are based on tests carried out in laboratories (pillar one of the government's testing programme) and in the wider community (pillar two). Barking & Dagenham in London continues to have the highest rate in England, with 1,687.1 cases per 100,000 people - up from 1,150.3 in the seven days to 28 December. Redbridge, also in London, has the second highest rate, up from 1,166.4 to 1,559.2. Thurrock in Essex has the third highest rate, up from 1,252.1 to 1,540.1. Richmond upon Thames has 629.7 - down from 639.3. If you're just joining us, here's a roundup of today's international headlines: Throughout the pandemic, the BBC is working hard to answer your questions on everything from vaccines to the latest rules where you live. New lockdowns are now in force in England and most of Scotland, as well as Wales and Northern Ireland. Tina Howson from Leicester asks: My elderly mum is my support bubble but she does not live locally (about a 90-minute drive away). Am I still allowed to go to see her? Find out how the BBC answered Tina's question - and others asked since then -here. A number of sporting fixtures in the UK have been cancelled after players tested positive for coronavirus. Among them are the FA Cup third round clash between Southampton and Shrewsbury and rugby union's Premiership game between Northampton Saints and Leicester Tigers - both of which were due to take place on Saturday. Other sides will field reserve or youth teams after their first team were forced to isolate. You can check the full list of affected fixtures, which the BBC will update,here. Meanwhile,Newcastle boss Steve Bruce has said it is ""morally wrong"" for football to continueamid increasing coronavirus outbreaks at clubs. The Magpies were the first team to have a Premier League match postponed this season, but more than 60 games in England have been called off. ""Financially it's right to play on, but for me, morally, it's probably wrong,"" said Bruce. ""I understand people want to see a game of football but we are just as vulnerable as everybody else."" Prof Chris Whitty will front one of the adverts The government is urging people in England to stay at home and ""act like you've got it"" as part of a new advertising campaign. The ""stay at home, save lives"" campaign will run across TV, radio, out-of-home advertising and social media. The campaign will include a new advert fronted by England's Chief Medical Officer, Prof Chris Whitty, which will air for the first time on ITV at 19:15 GMT tonight. The UK reported arecord number of deaths and casestoday, as hospitals come under growing pressure, with some in the South East at extreme capacity. Around one in three people with Covid-19 donât have any symptoms and can pass it on without realising, the government said, ""which is why itâs essential everyone stays at home and remembers Hands, Face, Space"". Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: ""Our hospitals are under more pressure than at any other time since the start of the pandemic, and infection rates across the entire country continue to soar at an alarming rate. âThe vaccine has given us renewed hope in our fight against the virus but we must not be complacent. ""The NHS is under severe strain and we must take action to protect it, both so our doctors and nurses can continue to save lives and so they can vaccinate as many people as possible as quickly as we can. âI know the last year has taken its toll â but your compliance is now more vital than ever. So once again, I must urge everyone to stay at home, protect the NHS and save lives.â Kevin PeacheyPersonal finance reporter England's eviction ban has been extended for six weeks, following a similar move in Scotland on Thursday. The move will mean eviction notices - which could have started again on Monday - will not be served on tenants during lockdown. It follows calls from charities for more financial support for tenants. Councils are also being given extra funding to house rough sleepers during the cold winter months. They will be asked to go back to people on the streets who had previously refused help, given the rising Covid infection rates. Evictions were banned at the start of the first lockdown in March - and the UK government has also extended the notice period landlords must give from three to six months. Concerns about homelessness and crowded accommodation have risen during the Covid crisis. Half a million private tenants in the UK are behind with their rent, according to research by Citizens Advice. You can read morehere. As we just reported, police and local leaders in Cumbria are urging people not to visit the Lake District this weekend. In Surrey, the council says an advertising van will tour busy areas, warning people to stick to the rules. In recent days the car parks at places including Box Hill, popular with walkers and cyclists, have been overcrowded. ""If youâre heading out for exercise, please stay local to where you live and do not mix in groups,"" says Steve Owen-Hughes,chair of Surreyâs Local Resilience Forum.,external Derwent Isle on Derwentwater Police in Cumbria, in north-west England, have urged residents and visitors to comply with national lockdown restrictions by not visiting the Lake District. In a tweet,external, the force shared a letter - backed by Cumbria's six MPs, several local councillors, NHS and tourism bosses - which urged people not to visit the Lake District National Park and instead ""stay local"" for exercise and essential shopping. It read: ""Whilst it may be tempting to go out for a scenic drive in the Lake District, now is the time to stay home, look after one another and play your part to make sure that Cumbria is ready for the return of visitors when it is safe to do so."" Maddy SavageBBC News, Stockholm Unlike many European leaders, Prime Minister Stefan LÃ¶fven has so far decided against a national lockdown As we reported at 12:01 GMT, Swedenâs parliament has agreed a new pandemic law allowing ministers to introduce stricter measures in the country. Within hours of the law being passed, Prime
Minister Stefan LÃ¶fven announced plans to limit numbers in gyms,
swimming pools and shops in relation to how big they are. Managers will need to
make sure thereâs at least 10 square metres available per person. The Social
Democrat leader also says there will be a ban of more than eight people at
bookable private party venues - from dining halls to common rooms in apartment
blocks. There is already a ban on holding public events for more than eight
people, such as concerts, plays or demonstrations. The law comes into force on
Sunday. Those who break new rules emerging from the legislation will face a
fine - with businesses told they may also be forced to close. Philippa RoxbyHealth reporter, BBC News The number of deaths with Covid-19 reported for the UK today has hita new high of 1,325. Even in the first peak of the pandemic, the daily record was 1,224 (on 21 April). It is a sad and sobering figure â and the grim truth is that the next few weeks are likely to see even more people dying and that figure rising further. That is because cases are continuing to rise, which means hospitals will fill up with more Covid patients, leading to the most seriously ill dying in several weeksâ time. It is an unstoppable trend. Of course, not all those 1,325 deaths happened today. This figure includes deaths that happened mostly over the past few days â but some will have occurred even earlier and a few before Christmas, and will only have been reported today. This lag in recording and reporting deaths over Christmas is why the deaths figures in the past three days have been over 1,000. A more even spread of deaths occurring every day is likely to be seen when we look back at the figures in several weeksâ time. But it doesnât take away from the fact that nearly 80,000 people have now died with Covid-19 in the UK. Alice EvansBBC News Fashion student Mhari Thurston-Tyler posted an advert for the ""crop top"" (right) on Depop after she says she found some discarded Chiltern Railways seat covers (like those on the left) A fashion student is being warned not to sell prohibited items on the clothes app Depop after she posted an advert for a top made from a train seat cover. Mhari Thurston-Tyler made the bandeau out of a Chiltern Railways seat cover designed to promote social distancing during the coronavirus pandemic. The 20-year-old sold the top for Â£15 but later refunded her customer and took the advert down. Depop says the item ""clearly violates our terms of service"". Chiltern Railways says it has been using the social distancing ""seat sashes"" since the beginning of the UK's Covid epidemic.

Organization says there is a ""clear problem"" of poorer countries not receiving supplies of
Covid-19 vaccines. ""Rich countries have the majority of the supply,"" Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus tells reporters in Geneva. He urges countries and manufacturers to
stop making bilateral deals at the expense of the Covax vaccine-sharing scheme. That scheme aims,external""to ensure that people in all corners of the world will get access to vaccines once they are available, regardless of their wealth"". As these graphics show, wealthier countries have made the quickest start on vaccinations - although not all countries are reporting data. Earlier this afternoon, the UK reported 1,325 coronavirus deaths within 28 days of a positive test - the highest daily figure of the pandemic. But Dr William Welfare, director for the Covid-19 response at Public Health England, says the daily death toll is likely to continue to rise. He says: âEach life lost to this virus is a tragedy, but sadly we can expect the death toll to continue to rise until we stop the spread. âApproximately one-in-three people who have coronavirus have no symptoms and could be spreading it without realising it. âTo protect our loved ones it is essential we all stay at home where possible. This will reduce new infections, ease the pressure on the NHS and save lives.â  Some Canadian snowbirds - retired people who travel south for the winter - are finding they are able to get vaccinations in Florida earlier than they could if they remained at home. Florida is allowing anyone over the age of 65 to be vaccinated for no charge. That includes non-citizens. Canada is prioritising health workers and people living in group homes. Getting a vaccine there is like winning the lottery, one coupletell CBC News,external. They say they were able to book vaccinations for other Canadian friends, who are now planning to travel to Florida for the jab after initially postponing their trip due to lack of vaccination. As we reported earlier this hour, the UK today reported a record number of coronavirus deaths and cases - 1,325 and 68,053 respectively. In the below graphics we explore the trends behind the numbers. This video can not be played As we've been reporting, London Mayor Sadiq Khan has declared a ""major incident"" as coronavirus threatens to overwhelm the capital's hospitals. Major incidents have previously been called for the Grenfell Tower fire in June 2017 and the terror attacks at Westminster Bridge and London Bridge. Mr Khan said: ""Unless the virus reduces... we could run out of beds."" A major incident is defined as being âbeyond the scope of business-as-usual operations, and is likely to involve serious harm, damage, disruption or risk to human life or welfare, essential services, the environment or national securityâ, according tothe mayor's statement.,external Julie Hambleton said she was issued with the penalty notice on 20 December, after the event a month earlier Campaigners attending a memorial to the Birmingham pub bombings have been issued with fixed penalty notices for breaching coronavirus restrictions. Six people, including Julie Hambleton, whose sister Maxine was killed in the 1974 attack, were given the fine over a memorial event on 21 November, the anniversary of the blasts that killed 21 people. Lawyers acting for the six say the notices will be challenged. The notices relate to a breach of regulations over the gathering of two or more in a public place, police say.

He calls the Moderna vaccine ""another weapon in our armoury"" against coronavirus. He says the UK government is aiming to offer a jab to ""between 14 and 15 million"" people by mid-February, who make up the four top priority groups - including theover-70s, the clinically extremely vulnerable, care home residents, and frontline health and social care workers. Zahawi adds he now has ""a much clearer line of sight"" in terms of the NHS's plan for the vaccination programme rollout and is confident the government can meet its targets. He says teachers will be ""top of the list"" in terms of phase two of the programme, as will be ""many other key workers"". Â© 2025 BBC.

"This video can not be played London mayor Sadiq Khan: ""Unless the virus reduces... we could run out of beds"" The spread of Covid in London is ""out of control"" according to Sadiq Khan, who has declared a ""major incident"". The coronavirus infection rate in London has exceeded 1,000 per 100,000 people, based on the latest figures from Public Health England. However, the Office for National Statistics recently estimatedas many as one in 30 Londoners,externalhas coronavirus. Mr Khan told BBC political reporter Karl Mercer that the figure is as high as one in 20 in some parts of London. Major incidents have previously been called for the Grenfell Tower fire in June 2017 and the terror attacks at Westminster Bridge and London Bridge. A major incident is any emergency that requires the implementation of special arrangements by one or all of the emergency services, the NHS or the local authority. It means the emergency services and hospitals cannot guarantee their normal level of response. Currently, there are more than 7,000 people in hospital with Covid-19, the mayor said. This is a 35% increase compared to last April's peak of the pandemic, he added. Dr Samantha Batt-Rawden, an ICU registrar and President of the Doctors' Association UK, tweeted: ""We tried. We really tried. NHS staff pleaded with people that Christmas is not worth it. Now one in 30 people in London have Covid and ICUs are overwhelmed. My heart is broken."" An analysis of Public Health England figures show in the week to 3 January, the number of cases rose across all of the London's boroughs compared with the previous week, with 17 individually recording more than 1,000 cases per 100,000 people. Testing increased in parts of the city after a drop over the Christmas period but positivity was high among people taking lab-based tests - suggesting more testing is needed to find undiagnosed cases in the community. In the past week, many parts of the capital saw a rise in deaths where a person had tested positive for coronavirus in the previous 28 days - with some areas recording more than double the number of deaths compared with the previous week. However, reporting over the Christmas period may have affected this. Out of the 18 acute hospital trusts in London providing figures to the government, all of them recorded having more beds being filled by coronavirus patients than in the previous week. Barts NHS Health, one of London's largest trusts, saw a 30% increase in coronavirus patients between 29 December and 5 January, to 830. The London Ambulance Service is now taking up to 8,000 emergency calls a day, the mayor says The mayor of London's announcement comes after the counties ofSussex and Surrey declared similar major incidentson Thursday. He said the London Ambulance Service was currently taking up to 8,000 emergency calls a day, compared to 5,500 on a typical busy day. The London Fire Brigade said more than 100 firefighters had been drafted in to drive ambulances to help cope with the demand. Every frontline agency involved in protecting the public has a legal duty to prepare for emergencies by devising and testing major incident plans. These public bodies declare a major incident when the situation they're confronting is so big or terrible that it's not only likely to cause serious harm, but it will also compromise their ability to respond effectively. In general terms, that means public bodies can legally stop delivering some everyday services, so that their personnel, attention and resources can be diverted to the emergency confronting them. At other times, the plans will lead to the military sending soldiers to aid the civilian effort, as we have seen already during the pandemic. Previous major incidents include the Grenfell Tower disaster in London, the Salisbury Novichok poisonings and the 2017 terrorism attacks. London's regional director for Public Health England Kevin Fenton said the current wave of coronavirus was ""the biggest threat"" the capital has faced in this pandemic to date. Prof Fenton urged Londoners to ""cut contacts"" and ""reduce movements"". He added: ""The emergence of the new variant means we are setting record case rates at almost double the national average, with at least one in 30 people now thought to be carrying the virus. ""We know this will sadly lead to large numbers of deaths, so strong and immediate action is needed."" This video can not be played What does it mean if the NHS is overwhelmed? Mr Khan is warning that London is ""at crisis point"". ""If we do not take immediate action now, our NHS could be overwhelmed and more people will die,"" he said. ""Londoners continue to make huge sacrifices and I am today imploring them to please stay at home unless it is absolutely necessary for you to leave. Stay at home to protect yourself, your family, friends and other Londoners and to protect our NHS."" He said he had written to Prime Minister Boris Johnson asking for more financial support for Londoners who need to self-isolate and are unable to work, and for daily vaccination data. Mr Khan also called for the closure of places of worship and for face masks to be worn routinely outside the home, including in crowded places and supermarket queues, in a bid to curb case numbers. BBC London political correspondent Karl Mercer Two hospital trusts in London have recorded more than 1,000 coronavirus deaths The mayor of London was in a sombre mood when I spoke to him earlier this afternoon. One in 20 Londoners in some areas now has Covid, and there is a real fear that hospitals will simply be overwhelmed in the next two weeks. Declaring a major incident is a real indication of the levels of concern felt not just at City Hall but across London's emergency services and the NHS. More Londoners are now in hospital with coronavirus than at the peak of the first wave last April - and those numbers are growing by more than 800 every day. It's believed the last mayor to declare a London-wide major incident was Boris Johnson in response to the 2011 riots. The coming days will be some of the most challenging in the city's recent history. Katie Sanderson, a junior doctor working in London, said she is worried how long medical staff can cope with the surge of patients. ""[Staff] are working on wards and spending long amounts of time with patients who need high-intensive oxygen therapy,"" she said. ""It is technically challenging and the emotional burden is enormous. I see it in a flatness in their demeanour, like we've all got used to doing things which before were totally inconceivable."" Georgia Gould, chair of London Councils, described London's rising coronavirus rate as ""dangerous"". She added: ""One in 30 Londoners now has Covid. This is why public services across London are urging all Londoners to please stay at home except for absolutely essential shopping and exercise. ""This is a dark and difficult time for our city but there is light at end of the tunnel with the vaccine rollout. We are asking Londoners to come together one last time to stop the spread - lives really do depend on it."" Hunt for vaccine fraudster who injected woman, 92 Everything you need to know about the Covid vaccine in the UK What has coronavirus done to TfL's finances? Earlier this week as the prime minister introduced an England-wide lockdown, the Met Police said officers were going to be""more inquisitive"" towards Londoners seen outside. The Met handed out 1,761 fines for breaches of coronavirus laws between 27 March and 20 December. Deputy Assistant Commissioner Matt Twist said the major incident was a ""stark reminder"" of the point London is at in the pandemic. He said: ""These rule-breakers cannot continue to feign ignorance of the risk that this virus poses or listen to the false information and lies that some promote downplaying the dangers. ""Every time the virus spreads it increases the risk of someone needlessly losing their life."" This video can not be played 'One of the worst shifts of my life - it's overwhelming' In response to Mr Khan's announcement the government said the NHS is continuing to ""face a huge challenge"" A spokeswoman added: ""It is absolutely paramount people in London, and the rest of the country, follow the rules and stay at home to protect the NHS and save lives. ""We are working closely with NHS England to support hospitals in the capital, including additional bed capacity at the London Nightingale. ""Financial support is in place for workers who need to self-isolate - including a Â£500 payment for those on the lowest incomes who have been contacted by NHS Test and Trace.""

"Marks & Spencer has temporarily stopped selling hundreds of items in its Northern Ireland stores due to Brexit red tape. The retailer said it feared its food would be blocked due to new rules governing shipments between Great Britain and Northern Ireland. A growing number of firms have spoken out about paperwork delays at ports. The government said traders and hauliers need to take steps to comply with new border rules. M&S took the decision to temporarily drop hundreds of products, including chocolate fudge pudding and sweet and sour chicken, from its Northern Ireland stores after it saw competitors' lorries barred from travelling between the mainland and Northern Ireland. An entire consignment in a lorry can be held up if only one item in the truck doesn't have the correct customs forms filled out. The retailer said it aimed to get the products back up for sale soon. An M&S spokesperson said: ""We have served customers in Northern Ireland for over 50 years and our priority is to make sure we continue to deliver the same choice and great quality range that our loyal customers have always enjoyed. ""Stores have been receiving regular deliveries this week, however following the UK's recent departure from the EU, we are transitioning to new processes and we're working closely with our partners and suppliers to ensure customers can continue to enjoy a great range of products."" In addition to problems shipping goods internally in the UK, the new Brexit trade rules are creating problems for exporters and traders transporting goods to and from the EU, say firms. The UK sealed a trade deal with the European Union (EU) on 24 December that was billed as preserving its zero-tariff and zero-quota access to the bloc's single market. But in addition to red tape causing delays, major retailers that use the UK as a distribution hub for European business could face possible tariffs if they re-export goods to the EU. On Friday, M&S chief executive Steve Rowe warned of more red tape and a rise in export costs to some countries. ""The best example I can give you of that is Percy Pig,"" he said, ""Percy Pig is actually manufactured in Germany. If it comes to the UK and we then send it to Ireland, in theory it would have some tax on it,"" he added. M&S said it was ""actively working to mitigate"" the effects of the ""rules of origin"" regulations, under which products are taxed differently depending on which country they come from. Other firms have also been hit by the confusion caused by new Brexit trading rules. Parcels giant DPD has suspended some services, while seafood exporter John Ross said the chaos was like being ""thrown in the cold Atlantic without a lifejacket"". Shane Brennan, chief executive of the Cold Chain Federation, which represents chilled transport and storage companies, said the emerging problems had come despite the amount of cross-border traffic still being quite low. ""Trade flows are still only about 50% of what we would expect, but even at those levels we are seeing levels of confusion and delays,"" he told the BBC's Today programme. ""The feeling is we are building to quite a significant potential disruption."" John Lewis scrapping overseas deliveries Were there hold-ups in first week after Brexit? Why are there empty shelves in some supermarkets? Covid tests for Channel hauliers to continue A government spokesman acknowledged that there had been ""some issues"", but said ministers had always been clear there would be some disruption at the end of the transition period. The Cabinet Office said in a statement that the volume of border crossings had been low so far this year, but that it expected crossings to steadily increase to normal levels. This brings the potential for ""significant disruption if traders and hauliers have not taken the necessary steps to comply with the new rules,"" the Cabinet Office said. Out of about 1,500 lorries per day trying to get from Great Britain to the EU in the new year, 700 have been turned away - mainly due to a lack of a negative Covid test for drivers, it said. ""We have always been clear there would be changes now that we are out of the customs union and single market, so full compliance with the new rules is vital to avoid disruption,"" said Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove. However, anger is growing among companies whose livelihoods depend on export trade. In a letter on Friday to Business Secretary Alok Sharma, Scottish salmon producer John Ross Jr launched a stinging attack on the government's handling of the situation. The firm's sales director, Victoria Leigh-Pearson, wrote that the company had in recent months ""had to endure the government issuing a barrage of useless information"" and an ""absence of factually correct information from all government agencies."" It amounted, she said, to ""gross incompetence"". John Ross exports to 36 countries and has won the Queen's Award twice Part of the letter to Alok Sharma: As I write, perishable goods that were dispatched from our facility five days ago, headed for France following a process that your department advised, have still not crossed the border. This usually takes only 24 hours because they are consolidated with the produce of other companies, which have not been able to follow the correct procedures due to a knowledge gap directly attributable to your department. Entire trucks are currently being rejected without explanation by the French customs authority. Our hauliers have now pulled their services as such a backlog has been created. Other hauliers are not taking on new customers. Today, we've even had confirmation that the IT systems of the UK and France are incompatible. After four years you only establish this now? Your so-called 'deal' is worthless if this situation is not fixed immediately, and unless you put in place measures to address the issues that continue to unfold on a daily basis. Moreover, as a seafood exporter, it feels as though our own government has thrown us into the cold Atlantic waters without a lifejacket. Yours sincerely, Victoria Leigh-Pearson, Sales Director, John Ross John Ross is not the only Scottish seafood exporter suffering. The industry says it has been hit by a ""perfect storm"" of Brexit disruption, which could sink a centuries-old industry. ""These businesses are not transporting toilet rolls or widgets. They are exporting the highest quality, perishable seafood which has a finite window to get to markets in peak condition,"" said Donna Fordyce, chief executive of Seafood Scotland. ""If the window closes, these consignments go to landfill."" She said the sector has already been weakened by Covid-19, the closure of the French border before Christmas as well as ""layer upon layer"" of problems associated with Brexit. The group fears that without exports, the fishing fleet will have little reason to go out. ""In a very short time, we could see the destruction of a centuries-old market which contributes significantly to the Scottish economy,"" added Ms Fordyce. UK government Minister for Scotland David Duguid blamed Scottish leaders for the issues. ""The Scottish Government has persistently refused to accept the democratic vote to leave the EU, but that does not allow them to abdicate their responsibilities to Scottish businesses,"" he said. ""Over the past 18 months they have assured the fishing industry that the systems they were putting in place would be adequate. They clearly are not."" Parcel delivery service DPD UK said it had paused its European Road Service because of the '""increased burden"" of customs paperwork for packages heading to the EU, including the Republic of Ireland. DPD said 20% of parcels had ""incorrect or incomplete data attached"", which meant they would have to be returned. This video can not be played What Brexit means for Britons travelling, shopping, studying or owning properties in the EU. In an email to its business customers, the company said that it had been a ""challenging few days"" for its international operation, and that it would ""pause and review"" its service.  It plans to restart on 13 January. ""It has now become evident that we have an increased burden with the new, more complex processes, and additional customs data we require from you for your parcels destined to Europe"" the firm wrote. The boss of one of Wales' largest hauliers said logistical problems have emerged at the Irish border too. Andrew Kinsella, managing director of Gwynedd Shipping, said his company has a backlog of 60 lorries waiting to be shipped to Dublin. He said many hauliers are finding that their customers are not able to generate the special declarations that are needed to ultimately enable a lorry to get onto a ferry. ""Whilst you don't see queues at ports and terminals the reality is that these queues are developing elsewhere in our depot in Holyhead, in our depot in Deeside and in our depot in Newport in South Wales, and lots of hauliers have depots in the proximity of ports,"" he said. ""There are a lot of issues about demarcation about who is going to arrange the export declaration with the UK revenue authorities, who's going to arrange the import declaration, the hauliers then trying to arrange the import safety and security declaration to create an ENS number which helps you generate a PBN number so there has been a lot of everyone finding their feet"".

"Covid infections rose by almost a third between 26 December and 3 January, reaching 70,000 new cases a dayaccording to a major study,external. In a different piece of research, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) estimated 1.2 million people in total had Covid over a similar time period. Daily infections are understood to have risen to about 150,000 since then. That would bring daily coronavirus cases above the first peak. The R or reproduction number for the virus is nowbetween 1 and 1.4 for the UK,external, reflecting the sharp rise in cases in recent weeks. SeparateONS data,externalsuggests just under half (44%) of British adults formed a Christmas bubble. These temporary rules let up to three households mix indoors on 25 December -unless they were living in a Tier 4 area. The ONS estimated how much of the population had Covid in the week of 27 December- 2 January: One in 50 in England (upfrom one in 70) One in 70 in Wales (downfrom one in 50) One in 200 in Northern Ireland (upfrom one in 230) One in 115 in Scotland (upfrom one in 145) The ONS data suggests cases rose by three-quarters between its two most recent study periods: 12-18 December and 27 December - 2 January. The ZOE Covid Symptom Study was able to track more recent changes since there was no pause in its research for Christmas. It found the epidemic is growing throughout the UK. Researchers estimate the virus's reproduction or R number is currently 1.2 across the UK. Both sources indicate London has the most severe epidemic with the highest number of cases. Confirmed cases, published on the government's dashboard, are always lower than those in surveys because they mainly reflect the test results of people coming in with symptoms. Both the ONS and ZOE also look at asymptomatic cases - people who may not otherwise get tests. Some asymptomatic testing is now available in the community but it is not being widely taken up. About a fifth of people responding to a separate ONS survey looking at the social impacts of the pandemic, said they had found it difficult to follow the Christmas rules. And half of those gave the fact that they had already made plans as the reason. Rules, which were set to allow everyone in the UK to mix in a five-day window, were changed at the last minute, on 19 December. In England, people living in Tiers 1-3 were allowed to form a one-day Christmas bubble with a maximum of two other households. Those in Tier 4, including about 10 million people in Greater London, were not permitted to mix at all. Mixing was permitted in Scotland and Wales for Christmas Day only.

"Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said it is ""excellent news"" that a third coronavirus vaccine has been approved for use in the UK. It is made by US company Moderna and works in a similar way to the Pfizer one already being offered on the NHS. The UK has pre-ordered 17 million doses of the Moderna vaccine - 10 million more than planned - but supplies are not expected to arrive until spring. It is the last Covid vaccine with final trial data published. There are hundreds still in development, with some expected to report findings in the near future. Around 1.5 million people in the UK have had at least one dose of a Covid vaccine so far, with either the Pfizer or AstraZeneca vaccines already approved by UK regulators. That figure includes almost a quarter of those aged over 80 in England - people at highest risk of severe illness or death from the virus. How will the UK vaccinate millions of people? When will you be eligible for a Covid vaccine? Vaccines are being given to the most vulnerable first, as set out in a list of nine high-priority groups, covering around 30 million people in the UK. This video can not be played Vaccine Deployment Minister Nadhim Zahawi welcomed the approval of the Moderna jab The prime minister has said the aim is to vaccinate 15 million people in the UK by mid-February, including care homes residents and staff, frontline NHS staff, everyone over 70 and those who are clinically extremely vulnerable. Health and Social Care Secretary Matt Hancock said: ""This is further great news and another weapon in our arsenal to tame this awful disease."" The UK had originally ordered 7 million doses of the Moderna jab, but has increased this to get even more people immunised as quickly as possible. In total, the UK has now ordered 367 million doses of vaccines to protect against Covid-19. Nadhim Zahawi, vaccine deployment minister, said: ""The NHS is pulling out all the stops to vaccinate those most at risk as quickly as possible, with over 1,000 vaccination sites live across the UK by the end of the week to provide easy access to everyone, regardless of where they live. ""The Moderna vaccine will be a vital boost to these efforts and will help us return to normal faster."" This video can not be played Covid vaccine safety: How does a vaccine get approved? The Moderna vaccine, an RNA vaccine like Pfizer's, injects part of the virus's genetic code in order to provoke an immune response. It requires temperatures of around -20C for shipping - similar to a normal freezer. In comparison, the Pfizer/BioNTech one requires temperatures closer to -75C, making transport logistics much more difficult. The AstraZeneca jab is easier to store and distribute, as it can be kept at normal fridge temperature. All of these vaccines require a second booster shot, but a first dose is likely to be given to as many people as possible. In trials with more than 30,000, the Moderna vaccine offered nearly 95% protection from severe Covid. No vaccine is 100% effective and it takes time for protection to build. For all of the Covid vaccines, we still do not know how long immunity will last. People who have received a coronavirus vaccine should continue to follow social distancing rules to protect themselves and others. EU and US regulators have already approved the Moderna vaccine.

"Marks & Spencer has temporarily stopped selling hundreds of items in its Northern Ireland stores due to Brexit red tape. The retailer said it feared its food would be blocked due to new rules governing shipments between Great Britain and Northern Ireland. A growing number of firms have spoken out about paperwork delays at ports. The government said traders and hauliers need to take steps to comply with new border rules. M&S took the decision to temporarily drop hundreds of products, including chocolate fudge pudding and sweet and sour chicken, from its Northern Ireland stores after it saw competitors' lorries barred from travelling between the mainland and Northern Ireland. An entire consignment in a lorry can be held up if only one item in the truck doesn't have the correct customs forms filled out. The retailer said it aimed to get the products back up for sale soon. An M&S spokesperson said: ""We have served customers in Northern Ireland for over 50 years and our priority is to make sure we continue to deliver the same choice and great quality range that our loyal customers have always enjoyed. ""Stores have been receiving regular deliveries this week, however following the UK's recent departure from the EU, we are transitioning to new processes and we're working closely with our partners and suppliers to ensure customers can continue to enjoy a great range of products."" In addition to problems shipping goods internally in the UK, the new Brexit trade rules are creating problems for exporters and traders transporting goods to and from the EU, say firms. The UK sealed a trade deal with the European Union (EU) on 24 December that was billed as preserving its zero-tariff and zero-quota access to the bloc's single market. But in addition to red tape causing delays, major retailers that use the UK as a distribution hub for European business could face possible tariffs if they re-export goods to the EU. On Friday, M&S chief executive Steve Rowe warned of more red tape and a rise in export costs to some countries. ""The best example I can give you of that is Percy Pig,"" he said, ""Percy Pig is actually manufactured in Germany. If it comes to the UK and we then send it to Ireland, in theory it would have some tax on it,"" he added. M&S said it was ""actively working to mitigate"" the effects of the ""rules of origin"" regulations, under which products are taxed differently depending on which country they come from. Other firms have also been hit by the confusion caused by new Brexit trading rules. Parcels giant DPD has suspended some services, while seafood exporter John Ross said the chaos was like being ""thrown in the cold Atlantic without a lifejacket"". Shane Brennan, chief executive of the Cold Chain Federation, which represents chilled transport and storage companies, said the emerging problems had come despite the amount of cross-border traffic still being quite low. ""Trade flows are still only about 50% of what we would expect, but even at those levels we are seeing levels of confusion and delays,"" he told the BBC's Today programme. ""The feeling is we are building to quite a significant potential disruption."" John Lewis scrapping overseas deliveries Were there hold-ups in first week after Brexit? Why are there empty shelves in some supermarkets? Covid tests for Channel hauliers to continue A government spokesman acknowledged that there had been ""some issues"", but said ministers had always been clear there would be some disruption at the end of the transition period. The Cabinet Office said in a statement that the volume of border crossings had been low so far this year, but that it expected crossings to steadily increase to normal levels. This brings the potential for ""significant disruption if traders and hauliers have not taken the necessary steps to comply with the new rules,"" the Cabinet Office said. Out of about 1,500 lorries per day trying to get from Great Britain to the EU in the new year, 700 have been turned away - mainly due to a lack of a negative Covid test for drivers, it said. ""We have always been clear there would be changes now that we are out of the customs union and single market, so full compliance with the new rules is vital to avoid disruption,"" said Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove. However, anger is growing among companies whose livelihoods depend on export trade. In a letter on Friday to Business Secretary Alok Sharma, Scottish salmon producer John Ross Jr launched a stinging attack on the government's handling of the situation. The firm's sales director, Victoria Leigh-Pearson, wrote that the company had in recent months ""had to endure the government issuing a barrage of useless information"" and an ""absence of factually correct information from all government agencies."" It amounted, she said, to ""gross incompetence"". John Ross exports to 36 countries and has won the Queen's Award twice Part of the letter to Alok Sharma: As I write, perishable goods that were dispatched from our facility five days ago, headed for France following a process that your department advised, have still not crossed the border. This usually takes only 24 hours because they are consolidated with the produce of other companies, which have not been able to follow the correct procedures due to a knowledge gap directly attributable to your department. Entire trucks are currently being rejected without explanation by the French customs authority. Our hauliers have now pulled their services as such a backlog has been created. Other hauliers are not taking on new customers. Today, we've even had confirmation that the IT systems of the UK and France are incompatible. After four years you only establish this now? Your so-called 'deal' is worthless if this situation is not fixed immediately, and unless you put in place measures to address the issues that continue to unfold on a daily basis. Moreover, as a seafood exporter, it feels as though our own government has thrown us into the cold Atlantic waters without a lifejacket. Yours sincerely, Victoria Leigh-Pearson, Sales Director, John Ross John Ross is not the only Scottish seafood exporter suffering. The industry says it has been hit by a ""perfect storm"" of Brexit disruption, which could sink a centuries-old industry. ""These businesses are not transporting toilet rolls or widgets. They are exporting the highest quality, perishable seafood which has a finite window to get to markets in peak condition,"" said Donna Fordyce, chief executive of Seafood Scotland. ""If the window closes, these consignments go to landfill."" She said the sector has already been weakened by Covid-19, the closure of the French border before Christmas as well as ""layer upon layer"" of problems associated with Brexit. The group fears that without exports, the fishing fleet will have little reason to go out. ""In a very short time, we could see the destruction of a centuries-old market which contributes significantly to the Scottish economy,"" added Ms Fordyce. UK government Minister for Scotland David Duguid blamed Scottish leaders for the issues. ""The Scottish Government has persistently refused to accept the democratic vote to leave the EU, but that does not allow them to abdicate their responsibilities to Scottish businesses,"" he said. ""Over the past 18 months they have assured the fishing industry that the systems they were putting in place would be adequate. They clearly are not."" Parcel delivery service DPD UK said it had paused its European Road Service because of the '""increased burden"" of customs paperwork for packages heading to the EU, including the Republic of Ireland. DPD said 20% of parcels had ""incorrect or incomplete data attached"", which meant they would have to be returned. This video can not be played What Brexit means for Britons travelling, shopping, studying or owning properties in the EU. In an email to its business customers, the company said that it had been a ""challenging few days"" for its international operation, and that it would ""pause and review"" its service.  It plans to restart on 13 January. ""It has now become evident that we have an increased burden with the new, more complex processes, and additional customs data we require from you for your parcels destined to Europe"" the firm wrote. The boss of one of Wales' largest hauliers said logistical problems have emerged at the Irish border too. Andrew Kinsella, managing director of Gwynedd Shipping, said his company has a backlog of 60 lorries waiting to be shipped to Dublin. He said many hauliers are finding that their customers are not able to generate the special declarations that are needed to ultimately enable a lorry to get onto a ferry. ""Whilst you don't see queues at ports and terminals the reality is that these queues are developing elsewhere in our depot in Holyhead, in our depot in Deeside and in our depot in Newport in South Wales, and lots of hauliers have depots in the proximity of ports,"" he said. ""There are a lot of issues about demarcation about who is going to arrange the export declaration with the UK revenue authorities, who's going to arrange the import declaration, the hauliers then trying to arrange the import safety and security declaration to create an ENS number which helps you generate a PBN number so there has been a lot of everyone finding their feet"".

"UK house prices rose by 6% last year, according to the Halifax, but the lender is predicting ""downward pressure"" on values in 2021. The mortgage lender, part of Lloyds Banking Group, said that prices ""soared"" in the second half of 2020. Pent-up demand, a clamour for more space, and stamp duty holidays led to higher prices. But the Halifax said the economic realities of 2021 meant activity would slow as the year progressed. ""With the pace of the UK's economic recovery expected to be constrained by the renewed national lockdown, and unemployment widely predicted to rise in the coming months, downward pressure on house prices remains likely as we move through 2021,"" said Russell Galley, managing director at the Halifax. He said that last year was a market of two halves - starting with slow growth, and stalling when the market was closed during the first national lockdown, but then booming when it reopened. This meant that overall, demand and price growth were relatively high. UK house prices see highest growth in six years Government vows to end complex leasehold costs Where can I afford to live? The conclusion mirrors the findings of rival lender, the Nationwide, which said that UK house prices climbed 7.5% in 2020, the highest growth rate for six years. Both mortgage lenders base their findings on their customer data. Lucy Pendleton, from estate agents James Pendleton, said: ""The simple truth is that extra space has become non-negotiable for legions of homeowners with families, and the usual winter slowdown has met the immovable force that is hundreds of thousands of people all trying to jump to larger properties at the same time."" The Halifax said there were already signs of the market slowing, with prices rising by 0.2% in December compared with the previous month. That was the slowest monthly rise of the last six months. The lender said the average home was valued at Â£253,374. Government vows to end complex leasehold costs Where can I afford to live?

"David Bowie left his mark with songs like Space Oddity, Let's Dance and Under Pressure A series of streamed music events, shows and new releases are marking David Bowie's birthday and the fifth anniversary of his death. The musician would have turned 74 on Friday, while Sunday is five years since he died of cancer. A star-studded tribute concert and his 2015 stage musical Lazarus will both be streamed over the weekend. Two previously unreleased Bowie tracks have also been released, while his music has now arrived on TikTok. BBC Sounds: Bowie Five Years On BBC Culture: The photos that made David Bowie an icon A career that shaped modern pop The tribute gig, titled A Bowie Celebration: Just For One Day, will feature Bowie's former bandmates alongside stars including Boy George, Duran Duran, Trent Reznor, Adam Lambert, Gary Barlow and actor Gary Oldman. Starting at 18:00 PT on Friday (02:00 GMT Saturday), the show will be led by Bowie's longtime pianist Mike Garson and will be available for 24 hours. Duran Duran released,externala timely cover of Bowie's track Five Years ahead of the show. ""My life as a teenager was all about David Bowie,"" singer Simon Le Bon said. ""He is the reason why I started writing songs. Part of me still can't believe in his death five years ago, but maybe that's because there's a part of me where he's still alive and always will be."" On Friday, Bowie's previously unreleased covers of Bob Dylan's Tryin' to Get to Heaven and John Lennon's Mother were also put out into the world. Allow YouTube content?

BBC Four is hosting a Bowie Night on Friday, while there will be special programmes on BBC Radio 4 and 6 Music. They include Bowie: Dancing Out in Space, which will air simultaneously on the two stations on Sunday. In it, producer Tony Visconti describes how Bowie and Lennon first met awkwardly in a New York hotel room ahead of their collaborations on the former's cover of The Beatles' Across the Universe and his own 1975 song Fame. ""He was terrified of meeting John Lennon,"" says Visconti. ""About one in the morning I knocked on the door and for about the next two hours, John Lennon and David weren't speaking to each other. ""Instead, David was sitting on the floor with an art pad and a charcoal and he was sketching things and he was completely ignoring Lennon. ""So, after about two hours of that, he [John] finally said to David, 'Rip that pad in half and give me a few sheets. I want to draw you.' So David said, 'Oh, that's a good idea', and he finally opened up. So John started making caricatures of David, and David started doing the same of John and they kept swapping them and then they started laughing and that broke the ice."" Meanwhile, next weekend will see the release of Stardust, a film biopic about Bowie's journey to becoming Ziggy Stardust, starring singer and actor Johnny Flynn. However, Bowie's family have not given it their blessing, meaning the film-makers were not allowed to use any of his music. Instead Flynn, as Bowie, is seen performing songs by Jacques Brel, The Yardbirds and one of Flynn's own compositions. Follow us onFacebook,external, or on Twitter@BBCNewsEnts,external.

"The band recently became a trio (left-right): Leigh-Anne Pinnock, Jade Thirlwall and Perrie Edwards Little Mix have risen to top the top of UK singles chart after Christmas songs released their grip on the top 40. Sweet Melody has become the band's fifth number one, three months after it was released - and will be their last with Jesy Nelson, who quit last year. The 29-year-oldsaid in Decemberthat nine years in the girl group had taken ""a toll on her mental health"". Little Mix's victory is part of a huge chart upheaval, after 56 Christmas songs dropped out of the top 100. Among them was last week's number one, Wham's Last Christmas, which set a new record for the biggest-ever fall from the top. The festive ballad has now left the chart altogether. The previous record-holder - Three Lions, by The Lightning Seeds with Frank Skinner and David Baddiel - fell from number one to 96 after England crashed out of the World Cup in 2018. Sweet Melody has risen from number nine to number one this week, giving Little Mix their first chart-topper since Shout Out To My Ex in 2016. Jade Thirlwall told BBC Radio 1 the milestone was particularly important because it was ""the last single we did as a four with Jesy"". ""And it's even more special that now, going into 2021 as a three, we've got the first number one,"" she added. Allow YouTube content? This article contains content provided by Google YouTube.

In the album chart, Taylor Swift's Evermore returned to number one, four weeks after its surprise pre-Christmas release, while companion album Folklore climbed to number 12. Meanwhile, Harry Styles' Fine Line reached a new chart peak at number two following the release of a video for his latest single Treat People With Kindness, which sees him dance with Fleabag's Phoebe Waller-Bridge.

"This video can not be played Transport Secretary Grant Shapps: 'We're trying to stop a new variant coming here' All international passengers will soon have to test negative for Covid-19 before travelling to the UK. People arriving by plane, train or boat, including UK nationals, will have to take a test up to 72 hours before leaving the country they are in. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said travellers ""can't board... without having that negative test"". But even with a negative test, arrivals from countries not on the travel corridor list must still quarantine. Mr Shapps said the government was ""very keen"" to set up compulsory testing now because of the new variant of the virus circulating in South Africa, which he said was ""causing great concern with the scientists"". ""They're not sure whether, for example, the vaccine will be able to deal with it in the first place, and we're very, very keen to keep it out,"" he told BBC Breakfast. The new variant prevalent in South Africa has got some potentially concerning changes that experts are closely monitoring. While it is extremely unlikely the mutations would render vaccines useless, scientists are doing tests to make sure immunisation will still work well. Even in the worst case scenario, vaccines can be redesigned and tweaked in a matter of weeks or months to be a better match if necessary, experts say. South Africa coronavirus variant: What's the risk? What are the new UK travel rules? Why Instagram is still full of influencers 'on holiday' Covid cases rise 27% in week after Christmas It comes after a further 1,162 deaths within 28 days of a positive test were reported in the UK on Thursday - the second consecutive day of more than 1,000 recorded fatalities. There were also 52,618 new cases. The R number - the average number of people that one infected person will infect - is now between one and 1.4,scientists have estimated.,external Amid the surge in cases, Prime Minister Boris Johnson has pledgedto offer ""hundreds of thousands"" of Covid vaccines per day in Englandby 15 January. On Friday, a third vaccine - made by Moderna -was approved for usein the UK. Under the new rules,external- which are expected to come in from next week - anyone who arrives in the UK and has not got proof of a negative test could face an immediate Â£500 fine. But there will be exemptions for: children under 11 hauliers those travelling from countries without the infrastructure to deliver tests - although details of those have not been released yet arrivals from the Common Travel Area with Ireland. All passengers arriving from countries not on the government'stravel corridor list,externalmust still self-isolate for 10 days, regardless of their test result. Mr Shappstold LBC,externalthe testing rule will come into force ""likely on Wednesday or Thursday next week"", and details of how to get tests abroad will be published on the gov.uk website. The rule will be UK-wide, although Northern Ireland said it had only ""agreed in principle"" and was working to solve any policy and operational issues. Non-essential travel abroad is not currently allowed in the UK, after lockdowns were brought in. People on holiday abroad could now face a scramble to book a test before their flight home ""All in all, the thought of an idyllic holiday 'away from it all' has been about as far from the truth as possible,"" says Rob Howard, who is is currently on holiday in Tenerife. He flew out before Christmas and - after deciding to extend his holiday by a week and rebooking a cancelled flight - is due to fly back next Wednesday. Reacting to the news that he will now likely need to take a Covid test before travelling, Rob, from Nuneaton, says: ""We are going to be expected to self isolate for 10 days so what is the point of this?"" Meanwhile, freelance MOT tester Matthew Auty, who lives in Normandy in France but works in Portsmouth during the week, says he's unhappy about the potential cost. ""These restrictions are reasonable for tourist travel but they are unfair for people in my position,"" he says. Figures from the aviation industry have urged the government to lift the rules as quickly as possible. ""This measure will destroy any confidence in forward bookings for air travel and for ferries, and it will essentially close off the UK,"" said Ryanair chief Michael O'Leary. He called for the government to set an ""end date"" for the rules, adding: ""The real solution to this is vaccination, not artificial travel restrictions. ""Boris Johnson has told us he will have vaccinated the 14 million high risk categories by the middle of February. What we need Grant Shapps to do today is confirm then that this ridiculous pre-arrival testing will then be removed by the middle of February."" The boss of Heathrow, John Holland-Kaye, said of the rule: ""If this will help, then so be it."" But he called it a ""really belt and braces approach"", adding: ""We have always argued for pre-departure testing as an alternative to quarantine... now we're going to have both"". ""And it can only be a temporary measure, very few people will travel with this in place,"" he added to BBC Radio 4's Today programme. Tim Alderslade, the chief executive of the industry body Airlines UK, said the move should be ""a short-term, emergency measure only"". ""Once the rollout of the vaccine accelerates, the focus must be on returning travel to normal as quickly as possible"", he added, including ""removing the need to quarantine or test"". Labour's shadow home secretary Nick Thomas-Symonds said the new measures were ""necessary"" but highlighted that the opposition party ""has been calling for a comprehensive strategy on testing for international travel since April"".

It comes afterEngland banned travellers from countries near South Africato stop the spread of the new local Covid variant. The latest travel curbs come as all of the UK is under strict Covid rules, with lockdowns in England, Wales, Northern Ireland and most of Scotland - meaning there is very little international travel. At a Downing Street press conference on Thursday,the prime minister confirmedalmost 1.5 million people in the UK had now received at least one dose of a Covid vaccine, but warned there would likely be ""lumpiness and bumpiness"" as the rollout continued.

"A further 1,325 people have died in the UK within 28 days of a positive Covid test - the biggest figure reported in a single day since the pandemic began. It means there have been just short of 80,000 deaths by that measure - as another 68,053 new cases were recorded. Public Health England (PHE) said the number of deaths would ""continue to rise until we stop the spread"". It comes as the government launches a new campaign in England urging people to ""act like you've got"" the virus. The campaign, including an advert fronted by England's chief medical officer, Prof Chris Whitty, is intended to remind the public Covid is spreading fast, with large numbers showing no symptoms. In the advert, Prof Whitty says: ""Covid-19, especially the new variant, is spreading quickly across the country. ""This puts many people at risk of serious disease and is placing a lot of pressure on our NHS. ""Once more, we must all stay home. If it is essential to go out remember, wash your hands, cover your face indoors and keep your distance from others."" Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: ""Our hospitals are under more pressure than at any other time since the start of the pandemic, and infection rates across the entire country continue to soar at an alarming rate.""

Hospital leaders have warned of stretched staffing with 31,624 coronavirus patients in UK hospitals on Wednesday - 46% above the peak during the first wave last year. Dr Ian Higginson, vice president of Royal College of Emergency Medicine, said the situation in London and south-east England was ""pretty dire"" and would get worse in the rest of the country before long. ""We're heading for some really dark times, I fear, in this phase of the pandemic,"" he said. Richard Mitchell, chief executive of Sherwood Forest Hospitals NHS Trust, said the increase in patients seen in London was now affecting his area in Nottinghamshire. He said: ""Critical care is exceptionally busy and the colleagues who work here are tired, they're fatigued and they're worn out."" Meanwhile, a third Covid vaccine receivedemergency approval for use in the UKwith 17 million doses of the jab, made by US firm Moderna, pre-ordered by the UK. The vaccine joins the Pfizer-BioNTech and Oxford-AstraZeneca jabs in being approved, with close to 1.5 million people now vaccinated in the UK. Check case numbers in your area Find out the rules where you live Your tributes to those who have died Dr William Welfare, Covid-19 response director at PHE, said: ""Each life lost to this virus is a tragedy, but sadly we can expect the death toll to continue to rise until we stop the spread. ""Approximately one in three people who have coronavirus have no symptoms and could be spreading it without realising it. ""To protect our loved ones it is essential we all stay at home where possible. This will reduce new infections, ease the pressure on the NHS and save lives."" London Mayor Sadiq Khan said the spread of Covid in the capital was now ""out of control"", as hedeclared a ""major incident"". This means the emergency services and hospitals cannot guarantee their normal level of response, and allows special arrangements to be implemented. The previous highest daily death toll - 1,224 - was recorded on 21 April 2020 during the UK's first lockdown. Daily deaths were in the single figures as recently as September. The UK has recorded the fifth-highest number of deaths behind the United States, Brazil, India and Mexico, according to Johns Hopkins University. We are now seeing the record numbers of cases over the Christmas period translate into record numbers of deaths. And with new infections rising rapidly - more than 1.1 million people in England estimated to be infected with Covid-19 last week - these tragic numbers are set to continue for some time. And that is mainly because of the new variant form of the virus which is thought to be between 30-70% more transmissible. The administration of the vaccines to at-risk groups should see a reduction in the numbers dying by the end of the month and the numbers having to go into hospital going down sometime after that. That is the other way around from what you normally hear - but that it because a successful vaccine programme will initially remove those most likely to die from the path of the virus. Fitter or younger people - who are less likely to die but could still end up occupying hospital beds - won't be getting their jabs for some time yet. The advent of spring's better weather should also help cases to fall, but ministers will have to decide what level of risk - and deaths - society is prepared to tolerate. Friday saw 619,941 tests conducted in the 24 hours to 09:00 GMT - also a new record. England, much of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland continue to be under strict national measures, withstay-at-home ordersin place for most people. The R number - the rate at which an infected person passes on the virus to someone else - is now estimated to be between 1.0 to 1.4, meaning the epidemic is growing between 0% and 6% per day. Covid infections rose by almost a third between Boxing Day and 3 January, reaching 70,000 new cases a dayaccording to a major study. In a different piece of research, an estimated 1.2 million people in total had Covid over a similar time period, the Office for National Statistics said. Boris Johnson pledged on Thursday to use England's lockdown to implement an ""unprecedented national effort"" to offer vaccination to those at the highest risk from Covid by 15 February. He said the Army would be drafted into use ""battle preparation techniques"" to achieve the goal, which could see up to 15 million people offered a vaccine by the middle of next month. In another development, from next week all travellers to the UKwill need to show a recent negative test resultbefore they arrive. Have you been affected by the issues raised in this story?

"Covid vaccination campaigns are under way in the UK and across the world. A range of vaccines are being used to reduce people's chances of getting sick, needing hospital treatment or dying. It is more than a year since the virus first emerged, yet many people are still vulnerable. The restrictions on our lives help keep the virus in check as they reduce opportunities for the virus to spread. Vaccines teach our bodies to fight the infection and are ""the"" exit strategy from the pandemic. The three vaccine frontrunners are those developed byPfizer-BioNTech,ModernaandOxford-AstraZeneca. Pfizer and Moderna both developed RNA vaccines - a new approach that is incredibly quick to design. They inject a tiny fragment of the virus's genetic code into the body, which starts producing part of the coronavirus and pushes the body to mount a defence. These have been approved for use in the UK, Europe and the US. The Oxford vaccine is subtly different as it uses a harmless virus to carry the same genetic material into the body. This has been approved in the UK and Europe. It is the easiest of the three to use as it can be stored in a fridge, rather than needing very cold temperatures. All three are supposed to be given as two doses. When will I get my Covid jab? How many people have been vaccinated in the UK so far? A single-dose Covid vaccine made by Janssen has now beenapproved for use in the UK. Twenty million doses of the jab, which was 85% effective in stopping severe illness from Covid-19 in trials, will arrive later this year. Because only one dose is needed - and the vaccine can be stored in a fridge - it could have a significant impact around the world. A billion doses are planned this year. Another jab,Novavax, is also being reviewed by drugs regulators. It uses a different, old-school, approach to vaccines - proteins from the virus and a chemical to prime the immune system are injected into the body. UK orders extra 40m doses of Valneva vaccine There are other noteworthy vaccines, even if they are not being used in Europe and the US. The Sinovac, CanSino and Sinopharm vaccines have been developed by scientists in China and deals have signed with other countries in Asia and South America. Around one million people in China are reported to have been given the Sinopharm injection. The Sputnik V vaccine, developed by Russia's Gamaleya Research Centre, is also effective according tolate stage trial results published in The Lancet. Some people have been immunised. The vaccine, which works in a similar way to the Oxford-AstraZeneca and Janssen vaccines has also been deemed to be safe - and offer complete protection against hospitalisation and death. What do we know about China's coronavirus vaccines? What we know about India's coronavirus vaccines Covid vaccines: How fast is worldwide progress? It is hard to compare one company's results with another as their trials will have been conducted in slightly different ways and at different points in the pandemic. However, all the main vaccines seem to have a large impact on your chances of needing hospital treatment or dying from Covid. Nonetheless, one of the most important questions - do they stop you spreading the virus - remains unknown. Understanding which method produces the best results will be explored inchallenge trialswhere people are deliberately infected with the virus. What drugs can help treat coronavirus? New versions of the coronavirus are emerging in countries around the world. However, there is a warning sign from Janssen and Novavax, which have the first ""real-world"" data on the new variants. Both showed a dip in their overall effectiveness in South Africa, where a new and worrying variant has been spreading. The results were still good and clearly better than no vaccine at all, but they emphasise how coronavirus is a moving target. We may need to change the vaccines we use in the future.

"The UK's Covid vaccine campaign has shifted its focus to boosters - an attempt to reduce the impact of the Omicron variant. Almost seven in 10 of those aged 12 or over in the UK have had a booster, while nine in 10 have had a single jab and more than eight in 10 have had a second dose. But despite more than 38 million boosters, or third doses, being given so far, more people are being urged to come forward and jabs are being rolled out to all five to 11-year-olds. The vaccine rollout was launched in winter 2020 and began with those considered most vulnerable before later moving down the adult age groups. All those aged 12 and over are eligible for two full doses while all five to 11-year-olds are now being offered two low-dose jabs, at least 12 weeks apart. Booster jabs are also available to all over-16s, as well as children aged 12-15 in at-risk groups. The JCVI says a fourth Covid jab is not yet needed because data shows, three months after a booster shot, people aged 65 and over still haveabout 90% protection against hospitalisation. The UK has approved five vaccines for use: Pfizer-BioNTech, Oxford-AstraZeneca, Moderna, Janssen and Novavax; four of which require two doses for maximum protection. Those receiving boosters have so far been receiving one dose of Pfizer or half a dose of Moderna. So far, more than 52 million people have had a first vaccine dose - some 92% of over-12s.  More than 49 million - 85% of over-12s - have had both doses. While uptake of first and second doses dropped off late last year, there was a steep rise in people having boosters. However, booster numbers dipped over the Christmas holiday period and remain low. More than 38 million booster doses have been administered across the UK so far. Overall vaccination rates have now levelled off in every age group in England apart from the youngest bands. The aim of the vaccination programme is toprotect as many people as possible from serious illness,externalthrough developing the UK population's immunity against Covid-19. Data from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) suggests more thannine in 10 adults,externalin the UK now have coronavirus antibodies - which is evidence of a past Covid infection or having received at least one dose of a vaccine. However, this figure does not tell us how many people are protected from infection or how close we are to reaching herd immunity - the point at which everyone is protected, directly or indirectly, as a result of high immunity levels in the population. Will a vaccine give us our old lives back? Is Covid at risk of becoming a disease of the poor? Across the country, there continues to be some variation in the vaccine programme. Scotland has vaccinated 93% of those aged 12 and over with at least one dose, while England and Wales have hit 92% and Northern Ireland 89%. Second doses are also being rolled out, with all nations reaching more than 80% of over-12s so far. Across the English regions, the South West has vaccinated 87% of the same age group with at least one dose, while London has reached 70%. When looking at boosters, the South West has reached 68% of people aged 12 and over, while for London the figure is 46%. There have also been disparities between ethnic groups and poorer and wealthier areas. Analysis of NHS records by theOpenSAFELY group,external- a collaboration between Oxford University and the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine - shows that black people were the least likely to have received a booster vaccine. The study was based on more than 20 million patient records in England and covers people not living in care homes. Areas of London are under-represented in the data. In addition, booster take-up in poorer areas is lower than in more affluent areas. Currently, the Pfizer-BioNTech, Oxford-AstraZeneca, Moderna, Novavax and one-shot Janssen vaccines are approved for use throughout the UK. Others, such that produced by CureVac, have not yet been given the green light. The UK had ordered more than 540 million doses of seven of the most promising vaccines, including the four so far approved for use. In addition, the government has now signed deals to buy 114 million more doses of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines to use in 2022 and 2023. French vaccine maker Valneva said the UK government had scrapped a deal for 100m doses of its vaccine, which is yet to be approved. LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area?

"Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said it is ""excellent news"" that a third coronavirus vaccine has been approved for use in the UK. It is made by US company Moderna and works in a similar way to the Pfizer one already being offered on the NHS. The UK has pre-ordered 17 million doses of the Moderna vaccine - 10 million more than planned - but supplies are not expected to arrive until spring. It is the last Covid vaccine with final trial data published. There are hundreds still in development, with some expected to report findings in the near future. Around 1.5 million people in the UK have had at least one dose of a Covid vaccine so far, with either the Pfizer or AstraZeneca vaccines already approved by UK regulators. That figure includes almost a quarter of those aged over 80 in England - people at highest risk of severe illness or death from the virus. How will the UK vaccinate millions of people? When will you be eligible for a Covid vaccine? Vaccines are being given to the most vulnerable first, as set out in a list of nine high-priority groups, covering around 30 million people in the UK. This video can not be played Vaccine Deployment Minister Nadhim Zahawi welcomed the approval of the Moderna jab The prime minister has said the aim is to vaccinate 15 million people in the UK by mid-February, including care homes residents and staff, frontline NHS staff, everyone over 70 and those who are clinically extremely vulnerable. Health and Social Care Secretary Matt Hancock said: ""This is further great news and another weapon in our arsenal to tame this awful disease."" The UK had originally ordered 7 million doses of the Moderna jab, but has increased this to get even more people immunised as quickly as possible. In total, the UK has now ordered 367 million doses of vaccines to protect against Covid-19. Nadhim Zahawi, vaccine deployment minister, said: ""The NHS is pulling out all the stops to vaccinate those most at risk as quickly as possible, with over 1,000 vaccination sites live across the UK by the end of the week to provide easy access to everyone, regardless of where they live. ""The Moderna vaccine will be a vital boost to these efforts and will help us return to normal faster."" This video can not be played Covid vaccine safety: How does a vaccine get approved? The Moderna vaccine, an RNA vaccine like Pfizer's, injects part of the virus's genetic code in order to provoke an immune response. It requires temperatures of around -20C for shipping - similar to a normal freezer. In comparison, the Pfizer/BioNTech one requires temperatures closer to -75C, making transport logistics much more difficult. The AstraZeneca jab is easier to store and distribute, as it can be kept at normal fridge temperature. All of these vaccines require a second booster shot, but a first dose is likely to be given to as many people as possible. In trials with more than 30,000, the Moderna vaccine offered nearly 95% protection from severe Covid. No vaccine is 100% effective and it takes time for protection to build. For all of the Covid vaccines, we still do not know how long immunity will last. People who have received a coronavirus vaccine should continue to follow social distancing rules to protect themselves and others. EU and US regulators have already approved the Moderna vaccine.

"A further 1,325 people have died in the UK within 28 days of a positive Covid test - the biggest figure reported in a single day since the pandemic began. It means there have been just short of 80,000 deaths by that measure - as another 68,053 new cases were recorded. Public Health England (PHE) said the number of deaths would ""continue to rise until we stop the spread"". It comes as the government launches a new campaign in England urging people to ""act like you've got"" the virus. The campaign, including an advert fronted by England's chief medical officer, Prof Chris Whitty, is intended to remind the public Covid is spreading fast, with large numbers showing no symptoms. In the advert, Prof Whitty says: ""Covid-19, especially the new variant, is spreading quickly across the country. ""This puts many people at risk of serious disease and is placing a lot of pressure on our NHS. ""Once more, we must all stay home. If it is essential to go out remember, wash your hands, cover your face indoors and keep your distance from others."" Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: ""Our hospitals are under more pressure than at any other time since the start of the pandemic, and infection rates across the entire country continue to soar at an alarming rate.""

Hospital leaders have warned of stretched staffing with 31,624 coronavirus patients in UK hospitals on Wednesday - 46% above the peak during the first wave last year. Dr Ian Higginson, vice president of Royal College of Emergency Medicine, said the situation in London and south-east England was ""pretty dire"" and would get worse in the rest of the country before long. ""We're heading for some really dark times, I fear, in this phase of the pandemic,"" he said. Richard Mitchell, chief executive of Sherwood Forest Hospitals NHS Trust, said the increase in patients seen in London was now affecting his area in Nottinghamshire. He said: ""Critical care is exceptionally busy and the colleagues who work here are tired, they're fatigued and they're worn out."" Meanwhile, a third Covid vaccine receivedemergency approval for use in the UKwith 17 million doses of the jab, made by US firm Moderna, pre-ordered by the UK. The vaccine joins the Pfizer-BioNTech and Oxford-AstraZeneca jabs in being approved, with close to 1.5 million people now vaccinated in the UK. Check case numbers in your area Find out the rules where you live Your tributes to those who have died Dr William Welfare, Covid-19 response director at PHE, said: ""Each life lost to this virus is a tragedy, but sadly we can expect the death toll to continue to rise until we stop the spread. ""Approximately one in three people who have coronavirus have no symptoms and could be spreading it without realising it. ""To protect our loved ones it is essential we all stay at home where possible. This will reduce new infections, ease the pressure on the NHS and save lives."" London Mayor Sadiq Khan said the spread of Covid in the capital was now ""out of control"", as hedeclared a ""major incident"". This means the emergency services and hospitals cannot guarantee their normal level of response, and allows special arrangements to be implemented. The previous highest daily death toll - 1,224 - was recorded on 21 April 2020 during the UK's first lockdown. Daily deaths were in the single figures as recently as September. The UK has recorded the fifth-highest number of deaths behind the United States, Brazil, India and Mexico, according to Johns Hopkins University. We are now seeing the record numbers of cases over the Christmas period translate into record numbers of deaths. And with new infections rising rapidly - more than 1.1 million people in England estimated to be infected with Covid-19 last week - these tragic numbers are set to continue for some time. And that is mainly because of the new variant form of the virus which is thought to be between 30-70% more transmissible. The administration of the vaccines to at-risk groups should see a reduction in the numbers dying by the end of the month and the numbers having to go into hospital going down sometime after that. That is the other way around from what you normally hear - but that it because a successful vaccine programme will initially remove those most likely to die from the path of the virus. Fitter or younger people - who are less likely to die but could still end up occupying hospital beds - won't be getting their jabs for some time yet. The advent of spring's better weather should also help cases to fall, but ministers will have to decide what level of risk - and deaths - society is prepared to tolerate. Friday saw 619,941 tests conducted in the 24 hours to 09:00 GMT - also a new record. England, much of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland continue to be under strict national measures, withstay-at-home ordersin place for most people. The R number - the rate at which an infected person passes on the virus to someone else - is now estimated to be between 1.0 to 1.4, meaning the epidemic is growing between 0% and 6% per day. Covid infections rose by almost a third between Boxing Day and 3 January, reaching 70,000 new cases a dayaccording to a major study. In a different piece of research, an estimated 1.2 million people in total had Covid over a similar time period, the Office for National Statistics said. Boris Johnson pledged on Thursday to use England's lockdown to implement an ""unprecedented national effort"" to offer vaccination to those at the highest risk from Covid by 15 February. He said the Army would be drafted into use ""battle preparation techniques"" to achieve the goal, which could see up to 15 million people offered a vaccine by the middle of next month. In another development, from next week all travellers to the UKwill need to show a recent negative test resultbefore they arrive. Have you been affected by the issues raised in this story?

"Covid infections rose by almost a third between 26 December and 3 January, reaching 70,000 new cases a dayaccording to a major study,external. In a different piece of research, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) estimated 1.2 million people in total had Covid over a similar time period.

The R or reproduction number for the virus is nowbetween 1 and 1.4 for the UK,external, reflecting the sharp rise in cases in recent weeks. SeparateONS data,externalsuggests just under half (44%) of British adults formed a Christmas bubble. These temporary rules let up to three households mix indoors on 25 December -unless they were living in a Tier 4 area. The ONS estimated how much of the population had Covid in the week of 27 December- 2 January: One in 50 in England (upfrom one in 70) One in 70 in Wales (downfrom one in 50) One in 200 in Northern Ireland (upfrom one in 230) One in 115 in Scotland (upfrom one in 145) The ONS data suggests cases rose by three-quarters between its two most recent study periods: 12-18 December and 27 December - 2 January. The ZOE Covid Symptom Study was able to track more recent changes since there was no pause in its research for Christmas. It found the epidemic is growing throughout the UK. Researchers estimate the virus's reproduction or R number is currently 1.2 across the UK. Both sources indicate London has the most severe epidemic with the highest number of cases. Confirmed cases, published on the government's dashboard, are always lower than those in surveys because they mainly reflect the test results of people coming in with symptoms. Both the ONS and ZOE also look at asymptomatic cases - people who may not otherwise get tests. Some asymptomatic testing is now available in the community but it is not being widely taken up. About a fifth of people responding to a separate ONS survey looking at the social impacts of the pandemic, said they had found it difficult to follow the Christmas rules. And half of those gave the fact that they had already made plans as the reason. Rules, which were set to allow everyone in the UK to mix in a five-day window, were changed at the last minute, on 19 December. In England, people living in Tiers 1-3 were allowed to form a one-day Christmas bubble with a maximum of two other households. Those in Tier 4, including about 10 million people in Greater London, were not permitted to mix at all. Mixing was permitted in Scotland and Wales for Christmas Day only.

"This video can not be played One floral tribute had Dame Barbara's photograph in the centre The funeral of EastEnders and Carry On actress Dame Barbara Windsor has taken place in London. Ross Kemp, who played her on-screen son in the soap, was among the 30 mourners and gave a reading, as did actor and friend Christopher Biggins. Dame Barbaradied in December at the age of 83, having had dementia. There were floral arrangements spelling Babs, The Dame and Saucy, and a mock pub sign showing her as The Queen Peggy in the style of the soap's Queen Vic. Dame Barbara played pub landlady Peggy Mitchell in EastEnders for more than two decades. A version of the EastEnders Queen Vic pub sign was painted in tribute Scott Mitchell, who was married to Dame Barbara for 20 years, was joined at Golders Green Crematorium by family and friends including comedians Matt Lucas and David Walliams. ""As Covid has denied so many of Barbara's family, friends and fans a chance to say farewell properly, I wanted to share the order of service to let people be a small part of it,"" Mr Mitchell told the PA news agency. ""My heart goes out to every family who have experienced the same restrictions at their loved ones' funerals."" Left-right: Christopher Biggins, Ross Kemp and David Walliams were among the mourners He added: ""I would again like to thank my family, friends, the media and the public for their incredible support and well wishes since Barbara's passing."" Dame Barbara's coffin was brought into the crematorium to sound of Frank Sinatra's On The Sunny Side Of The Street, and the service featured a recording of Sparrows Can't Sing from the actress's 1963 film of the same. It finished with the famous topless photo of Dame Barbara from the film Carry On Camping, alongside her quote: ""That picture will follow me to the end."" Long-time friend Anna Karen, who played Dame Barbara's on-screen sister Aunt Sal in EastEnders, also paid tribute during the service. The funeral was also attended by Loose Women's Jane Moore and EastEnders actor Jamie Borthwick. However, the numbers were limited due to coronavirus social distancing. Alzheimer's Research UK recently said it had seen a spike in donations since Dame Barbara's death, and a JustGiving page set up as a tribute to her and in aid of the charity has raised more than Â£150,000 (including Gift Aid). Mr Mitchell said that was ""beyond anything we may have dreamed of"". Follow us onFacebook,external, or on Twitter@BBCNewsEnts,external.

"Vincent Kane - pictured with his grandson Sonny - is facing uncertainty about his operation The son of a man with pancreatic cancer has said the last-minute cancellation of his surgery has been ""devastating"". Jodie Kane said his father Vincent was due to have his operation on Friday. However, that procedure was cancelled by the Belfast Health Trust on Tuesday as the worsening coronavirus crisis increases the pressure on hospitals. The trust apologised, saying it had faced an 80% rise in the number of patients with Covid-19 admitted to hospitals since Christmas Day. Speaking on BBC Radio Ulster's Nolan Show, Jodie said that there was now ""no guarantee"" his 68-year-old father would get the treatment. ""To be told we had the chance of a very successful surgery on offer and then to have it taken away at the last minute is pretty devastating,"" he said. Belfast Trust cancels urgent cancer surgeries ""Even the surgeon himself said they would be concerned if it was to go on more than four weeks. ""There is an uncertainty hanging over us now that we don't know when he'll actually get that surgery or what the impact on his health is going to be."" Vincent Kane - pictured with his with wife Karen - has been suffering other health issues arising from his cancer Vincent, from Newtownards, County Down, did not receive treatment for some of his other symptoms as it was planned that the surgery would help with those. ""Because they were hoping to get him straight into surgery he hasn't had the blockage in his gall bladder addressed so he's jaundiced, he's covered in a rash, can't sleep, he's lost a lot of weight,"" Jodie said. 'I would beg for a hospital appointment' ""Undoubtedly there are people worse off than us out there but it is still a critical illness that he has got and it is one that we don't have an end in sight for, in terms of treatment. ""There must be a way of helping all those in need, or I suppose if you were being really honest about it those who stand the best chance of surviving - making the decisions for the benefit of them. ""There's no guarantee that in six weeks' time surgery is going to be an option because who knows what's going to happen with Covid?"" The Belfast Health Trust said it had to reduce the number of ill patients on wards to protect them from coronavirus Jodie called on those who were breaking Covid-19 regulations to think about the the ""direct and indirect impacts"" of their actions. ""We've every sympathy for anyone who has a loved one who needs [intensive] care because of Covid but cancer and Covid are both life-and-death situations. ""We can minimise the risks of one of them as a collective society just by taking the necessary precautions. ""It could be someone they love or their neighbour or someone in their community that's in the same situation as us in the very near future."" Flo McClements, who was diagnosed with ovarian cancer in December, found out on Tuesday that her surgery - scheduled for Thursday - had been cancelled by the Belfast Health Trust. Speaking to BBC Radio Foyle, her son Gregg said the pressure was ""mounting day by day"" on the the 72-year-old from Ballymoney, County Antrim. ""She had waited all through Christmas for the date and due to the Covid-19 restrictions we as a family had stayed away from her,"" he added. Flo McClements' family wants to ""give her a hug"" after her operation was cancelled ""We left her on her own with my dad just to make sure she didn't catch Covid and risk the operation. ""When you get the date you like to think it's the next step to recovery but unfortunately that didn't happen."" Gregg said his mother was ""putting on a brave face"" but it was difficult for the family to not be with her in person during what was a difficult time. ""That's actually the hardest part that we can't go up and have a cup of tea with her or give her a hug to make her feel a bit better even for a few minutes."" The Belfast Health Trust said it ""would like to sincerely apologise"" to those affected by the postponement of surgeries. It said the decision was taken to reduce the number of ill patients on wards that would be more at risk from the virus than others. ""This was an incredibly difficult decision to make and we did not take it without considering all the information available to us,"" said the trust. ""We do not underestimate the anxiety and distress this causes the patients and families affected and we deeply regret this. It said it would do ""everything in our power"" to reschedule their operations ""as soon as possible"".

In England, people living in Tiers 1-3 were allowed to form a one-day Christmas bubble with a maximum of two other households. Those in Tier 4, including about 10 million people in Greater London, were not permitted to mix at all. Mixing was permitted in Scotland and Wales for Christmas Day only.

"Marks & Spencer says sales of sleepwear have soared as people spend more time at home because of Covid restrictions. The retailer sold 20% more women's pyjamas during the 13 weeks to 26 December, with many of them being bought as Christmas presents. ""The great British public are back in their pyjamas,"" said chief executive Steve Rowe. Despite this, clothing sales as a whole fell nearly a quarter, although food sales showed modest growth. M&S said its trading was ""robust"" over the Christmas period, but UK revenues for the quarter were Â£2.52bn, 8.2% lower than last year. M&S blamed ""on-off restrictions and distortions in demand patterns"" due to the coronavirus crisis. International revenues also took a big hit, falling 10.4%. M&S also said that potential post-Brexit tariffs on part of its range exported to the EU, together with ""very complex"" administrative processes, would ""significantly impact"" its businesses in Ireland and the Czech Republic, as well as its franchise business in France. Mr Rowe said the chain's popular Percy Pig sweets, made in Germany, were one product that could face tax rises. It said it was ""actively working to mitigate"" those effects. Sainsbury's festive boost despite smaller turkeys Champagne puts fizz in Morrisons' Christmas sales Mr Rowe thanked staff for ""a first-class execution of Christmas for our customers in near impossible conditions"". The High Street stalwart said customers had responded to its ""innovative seasonal product"" during the four-week run-up to Christmas. Like-for-like food sales had risen 2.6% during the period, it said. However, clothing and home sales fell by 24.1%, and UK sales overall were down 7.6% on a like-for-like basis. Trading was hit particularly badly in November by the national lockdown in England, with clothing and home sales slumping 40.5% in the month and food sales down 4.5%. ""Near-term trading remains very challenging, but we are continuing to accelerate change under our Never the Same Again programme to ensure the business emerges from the pandemic in very different shape,"" Mr Rowe said. On the positive side, M&S said its tie-up with online firm Ocado had produced ""very strong"" results, while customers had responded to its ""innovative seasonal product"" during the four-week run-up to Christmas. Ross Hindle, retail sector analyst at Third Bridge, said: ""Despite the pressure faced by their clothing division, the M&S food division is expected to deliver solid results, propelled by both stockpiling and its Ocado partnership. He pointed to reports that M&S was poised to acquire the Jaeger clothing brand as a possible way forward, saying it ""hints at the potential for a more aggressive shift into the multi-brand space"". ""M&S have numerous large stores which could be filled with non-M&S merchandise in order to drive their top-line. The risk here is whether such brands might cannibalise M&S branded products,"" he added.

She saw little point in a potential purchase of Jaeger, as it would be ""costly to turn around and do little to boost the retailer's fortunes"".

"Police have issued CCTV footage of a man they want to speak to in connection with the incident A fraudster claiming to work for the NHS injected a 92-year-old woman with a fake Covid-19 vaccine, City of London Police has said. Detectives are hunting the man who charged the victim in Surbiton, south-west London, Â£160. Police said it was ""crucial"" he was caught as soon as possible as he ""may endanger people's lives"". Det Insp Kevin Ives described it as a ""disgusting and totally unacceptable assault"". It comes after the NHS warned people that no-one should be turning up at doorsteps offering a vaccine for payment,following a spate of fake text messages. Under the current coronavirus vaccine rollout plans, people will be invited to receive the vaccine by their GP or healthcare provider. Police said the victim allowed the man into her home on the afternoon of 30 December after he said he was from the NHS and there to administer the Covid-19 vaccine. She said she was jabbed in the arm with a ""dart-like implement"" before being charged Â£160, which the man said would be refunded by the NHS. Everything you need to know about the Covid vaccine in the UK Police said it was not known what substance, if any, was administered, but the woman had been checked at her local hospital and showed no ill effects. Det Insp Ives appealed for information to help identify the suspect. He added: ""It is crucial we catch him as soon as possible as not only is he defrauding individuals of money, he may endanger people's lives."" The man made a second visit to the woman's home on 4 January, when he asked for another Â£100, police said. The man was spotted in the Tolworth area of Kingston-upon-Thames on 4 January Officers released CCTV footage on Friday of a man dressed in a navy blue tracksuit with white stripes down the side, who they want to speak to in connection with the incident. He is described as a white man in his early 30s, who is about 5ft 9ins (1.75m) tall, of medium build, with light brown hair that is combed back. He speaks with a London accent. A spokesman for the Department of Health said: ""NHS England will never ask for bank details, Pin numbers or passwords, when contacting you about a vaccination.

"Donald Trump became the first US president to be impeached twice Former US President Donald Trump is being put on trial by lawmakers for allegedly inciting a riot at the US Capitol. Last month Mr Trump became the first president in US history to be charged with misconduct - or impeached - twice by the lower chamber of Congress. Republicans and Democrats in the House of Representatives voted to pass an article of impeachment that accused Mr Trump of ""incitement of insurrection"". The article alleged that Mr Trump had made false allegations of election fraud and encouraged his supporters to storm Congress on 6 January. Now a trial is being held in the upper chamber of Congress, the Senate, which will decide whether to convict or clear Mr Trump of the charge. This is an unprecedented moment for the US, which has never put an impeached president on trial after they have left office. So, what can we expect? The trial in the Senate is political, rather than criminal. A vote will be held at the end of the trial to determine whether Mr Trump is guilty of the charge. A two-thirds majority of the 100-member Senate must back a guilty verdict to convict Mr Trump. If Mr Trump is convicted, senators could also vote to bar him from ever holding public office again. This video can not be played House delivers impeachment charge against Donald Trump to the Senate The trial opened on Tuesday with a four-hour debate on whether the proceedings were unconstitutional because Mr Trump is no longer president. A 56-44 majority then voted in favour of continuing, with six Republicans backing the measure. Each side will then be given 16 hours in total to make their arguments, and this will be limited to eight hours in any one day. There will be an option to request a debate and a vote on whether witnesses should be called. Both Democrats and Republicans are said to favour a speedy trial, amid an ongoing effort to get President Joe Biden's Covid-19 relief plan approved. It is thought a vote on a conviction could come as early as Monday if no witnesses are called. Democrats prosecuting the case opened the proceedings by showing a dramatic video montage of Mr Trump's 6 January speech and the deadly rioting by some of his supporters. ""That's a high crime and misdemeanour,"" Representative Jamie Raskin of Maryland - who is leading the case - said of the footage. ""If that's not an impeachable offence, then there's no such thing."" They say Mr Trump is ""personally responsible"" for the riot and must be convicted. This video can not be played Jamie Raskin: 'They thought they were going to die' According toa pre-trial legal brief, they will say his repeated refusal to concede the election led to an ""incitement of insurrection against the republic he swore to protect"". Mr Trump's ""statements turned his 'wild' rally on 6 January into a powder keg waiting to blow"", they will argue. Although he is no longer in office, Mr Trump ""must answer comprehensively for his conduct in office from his first day in office through his last"", Democrats argue. They have called for Mr Trump to be disqualified from ever running for office again. On the opening day, his defence lawyers argued unsuccessfully that it was unconstitutional to put a private citizen through the impeachment process. Defence lawyer David Schoen said the Democrats were using ""the guise of impeachment as a tool to disenfranchise"" those who support Donald Trump. His lawyers are now likely to change tack and argue that Mr Trump's supporters stormed Congress of their own accord. This video can not be played Trump's lawyer, David Schoen: 'Overriding emotion is to cry for the US Constitution' According to their own pre-trial brief, they will argue that Mr Trump's pre-riot remarks did not amount to incitement. The former president's call to ""fight"" was not meant to be taken literally, they say. ""To characterise this statement alone as 'incitement to insurrection' is to ignore, wholesale, the remainder of Mr Trump's speech that day, including his call for his supporters to 'peacefully' making their 'voices heard,'"" they add. Moreover, FBI documents had shown that the riot was planned days in advance, the lawyers said. It is never happened before, so it is untested and the US Constitution does not say. Impeachment proceedings against President Richard Nixon were ended when he quit in 1974. So Mr Trump could take his case to the Supreme Court, claiming his trial was unconstitutional. Some lower ranked officials have been impeached after leaving office. What happens to impeached presidents? What impeachment means for Trump, Biden and America That is certainly what prosecutors wanted. Last week, they sent a letter inviting him to testify under oath ""at a mutually convenient time and place"". The prosecution team suggested that they would cite Mr Trump's silence as further proof that their allegations were true. Within hours, however, the former president's lawyers had rejected the request as a publicity stunt. They made clear he would not testify voluntarily. The prosecutors do have the power to issue a subpoena - or an order to compel him to appear in court to testify - but that is considered unlikely. Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts presided over the first impeachment trial of Mr Trump, but will not do so again. Democratic Senator Patrick Leahy - third in the line of presidential succession - is presiding over the trial instead. Prosecuting the case are nine House Democrats, known as the impeachment managers. Mr Trump is being represented by two attorneys - Bruce Castor and David Schoen. All 100 US senators have been sworn in as jurors in the trial. Democrats only hold half the 100 seats so they would require 17 Republicans to vote against someone from their own party. That is a high bar for a party that has largely remained publicly loyal to Mr Trump. Ten Republicans in the House supported impeachment and a handful of senators have indicated they are open to it. But Tuesday's vote implied loyalty toward the former president in his party remained high enough to avoid a conviction. At the Capitol: Trump's Christian supporters 'Like a medieval battle': The riots frontline If he is convicted by the Senate, lawmakers must hold another vote to block him from running for elected office again - which he had indicated he planned to do in 2024. This could be the biggest consequence of this impeachment. If he is convicted, a simple majority of senators would be needed to block Mr Trump from holding ""any office of honour, trust or profit under the United States"". So 50 senators plus a casting vote from Vice-President Kamala Harris would be enough to damn Mr Trump's hopes of political power. This could be appealing to Republicans hoping to run for president in the future and those who want Mr Trump out of the party. There has been talk of Mr Trump losing benefits granted to his predecessors under the 1958 Former Presidents Act, which include a pension and health insurance, and potentially a lifetime security detail at taxpayers' expense. However, Mr Trump is likely to keep these benefits if he is convicted after leaving office. That was over his dealings with Ukraine, although he denied any wrongdoing. He was accused of pressing the country's leader to open an investigation into Mr Biden, then his emerging rival for the White House, and his son Hunter. Mr Trump appeared to use military aid as leverage. He was impeached by the House and cleared by the then Republican-controlled Senate. Hang on, why was Trump impeached again?

"Brian Sicknick ""was physically engaging with protesters"" when he was injured The FBI will join an investigation into the death of a police officer from injuries sustained during the pro-Trump siege of the US Capitol, authorities say. Brian Sicknick, 42, was injured while ""physically engaging with protesters"", police said. Acting Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen said no resources would be spared to hold those responsible to account. Flags over the Capitol were lowered in the officer's honour on Friday. Sicknick's death was the fifth linked to Wednesday's riots, which have led to calls for President Donald Trump to be removed from office. Air Force veteran Ashli Babbitt was shot by a police officer, while three others died after suffering unspecified medical emergencies. Follow our live updates Questions mount over Capitol security failure The US vet shot dead breaking into the Capitol The chief of the US Capitol Police (USCP) said more than 50 law enforcement officers had been injured during the siege. The details surrounding Sicknick's death are still unclear. In a statement, the USCP said Sicknick died at approximately 21:30 local time (02:30 GMT) on Thursday ""due to injuries sustained while on duty"". He was responding to the riots at the US Capitol when he was injured, the force said.

Citing two law enforcement officials,the New York Times reported,externalthat Sicknick was struck with a fire extinguisher at some point during the breach of Congress. However, reports of an attack haven't been confirmed. On Friday, Mr Rosen said the FBI and Washington police would jointly investigate Sicknick's death, although he did not say if it would be treated as suspected murder. US broadcaster CNN, citing a law enforcement official, reported,externalthat federal prosecutors were planning to open a murder investigation. Sicknick was born the youngest of three brothers in South River, New Jersey. He ""wanted to be a police officer his entire life"", his brother, Ken Sicknick, said in a statement. ""Brian is a hero and that is what we would like people to remember,"" his brother said. Sicknick joined the Capitol Police in July 2008 and most recently served in the department's First Responder's Unit. The police officer killed during the riot at the US Capitol has been named as Brian Sicknick Prior to that, he served in the New Jersey Air National Guard, which he joined in 1997. He was deployed to Saudi Arabia in 1999 in support of Operation Southern Watch, and in Kyrgyzstan in 2003 in support of Operation Enduring Freedom, the Iraq War. He was honourably discharged in 2003. ""Staff Sgt Sicknick's commitment to service and protect his community, state, and nation will never be forgotten,""the New Jersey National Guard said,external. The White House and senior politicians, both Democratic and Republican, have been paying their respects to Sicknick. Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi ordered the flags at the Capitol building to be lowered to half-mast. ""The violent and deadly act of insurrection targeting the Capitol, our temple of American democracy, and its workers was a profound tragedy and stain on our nation's history,"" she said in a statement. Flags were flown at half mast at the US Capitol on Friday A spokesman for President Trump said that he and his ""entire administration extend our prayers to Capitol Police Officer Brian Sicknick's family as we all grieve the loss of this American hero"". Virginia Democrat Don Beyer has called for Sicknick to lie in state in the Capitol Rotunda, saying ""he made the ultimate sacrifice"" to protect lawmakers. Republican Senator Marsha Blackburn said she was ""truly devastated"" by the news. Muriel Bowser, the Democratic mayor of the district of Columbia, paid tribute to Sicknick in a tweet.

"James Jordan (left) and his younger brother David both tested positive for coronavirus on 30 December The brother of a man who died in his sleep at home with coronavirus is warning people not to ""naively walk into the abyss"" by ignoring symptoms. James Jordan, 40, and his younger brother David, 36, of Salisbury, both tested positive on 30 December. David went to bed with a cough and ""tight chest"" on 2 January but James ""woke up at six in the morning to find him dead in his sleep"". He said he should have ""read"" how his brother was doing and contacted 111. ""That's what we should have done - had we done that he would have gone off to hospital the night before and he'd probably still be with us,"" he said. ""But we just sat there because we thought we were all right because we were relatively young."" Mr Jordan said his brother was a ""big chap but a fit chap"" who swam 80 lengths of the local leisure centre pool each morning. ""He swam Lake Windermere, which is 10 miles long, in a good time a few years ago and completed a middle-distance triathlon with me,"" he said. ""We weren't aware of any underlying health conditions so it's a complete shock."" People dying with Covid aged under 40 remain rare with less than 1% of the UK's deaths being from this age group. On average, for every 3,000 people infected who are aged in their 30s, one person will die with the disease. David Jordan, who worked as a warehouse manager for Woolley and Wallis in Salisbury, was a keen swimmer and runner He said on the night before his brother died, they had been getting ready to isolate and had ordered some shopping to be delivered. ""We were getting set to to just concentrate on staying in and getting fit,"" he said. ""He was coughing quite a lot but beyond that we went off to bed at a sensible sort of time.

"Former Det Insp Tim Ireson led the unit for two years and would have been sacked if he was still serving Three members of a ""toxic"" police unit have been sacked for gross misconduct after their ""offensive"" conversations were secretly bugged. The devices picked up ""homophobic, racist and sexist"" conversations in the offices of Hampshire's Serious and Organised Crime Unit in Basingstoke in 2018, a misconduct panel heard. A number of force staff referred to it as a ""lads' pad"". Two other officers would have been sacked but had already left the force. The misconduct hearing was told in the 24 days the office was bugged - following concerns raised by a whistleblower - there was ""enough profanity, casual sexism and racism to last a lifetime"". Det Sgt Oliver Lage, Det Sgt Gregory Willcox and PC James Oldfield have been dismissed while retired Det Insp Tim Ireson and former PC Craig Bannerman were the two who had previously left the force. Trainee Det Con Andrew Ferguson, who sent colleagues a fake pornographic image of members of the royal family, has been given a final written warning. The six men were based at the Serious and Organised Crime Unit in Basingstoke Imposing the sanctions, panel chairman John Bassett said the conduct had been ""shameful"". He said police officers could not ""pick and choose the standards they will abide by"" in order to create more ""cohesive"" teams. Mr Bassett said PC Ferguson was ""essentially a good officer"" who joined the team three months before the recordings, by which time the ""culture was well-established"". He said the officer was ""conflicted by what he witnessed"" and ""felt unable to raise the matter with a supervisor"". Chief Constable Olivia Pinkney said the force's internal investigation had revealed a ""catalogue of sexist, racist, homophobic and ableist language and commentary that has rightly shocked us all"". She added: ""These officers have failed to deliver on the promise they made to uphold fundamental human rights and accord equal respect to all people. ""[They] have undermined the trust and confidence of our communities and damaged the reputations of their colleagues."" The six officers have apologised but some told the disciplinary panel swearing was in the ""fabric"" of the police force. One also said they felt they were being ""made an example of"" by the force which should have learned from other previous incidents. In all, 20 police officers and staff from the unit have faced some sort of disciplinary action. During the misconduct hearing at Hampshire Constabulary's headquarters in Eastleigh, it was heard a ""toxic, abhorrent culture"" developed with officers using offensive terms for women, black people, immigrants, disabled, gay and transgender people and foreign nationals. Jason Beer QC, prosecuting, said the only black member of the team was referred to using racist tropes and references to slavery. Women were described using derogatory terms and stared at in the canteen, he added. The men admitted some of the charges of breaching standards of professional behaviour against them but claimed it only amounted to misconduct not gross misconduct. Zoe Wakefield, chair of Hampshire Police Federation, said: ""The outdated and offensive views we heard during the hearing have no place in society and they certainly have no place in policing. ""We should not let the awful language and terminology used by a very small number of police officers tarnish the hard work and dedication of thousands of police officers and staff in Hampshire..."" 'Toxic' police unit officers guilty of misconduct Officers 'permitted toxic culture in police unit' Detective breaks down at misconduct hearing Offensive words 'widely used' in police force Police officer 'used work email' for football club Officers 'shared fake explicit images of royals' Police unit 'homophobic, racist and sexist' Hampshire Constabulary Popular Southampton Pub Relaunches With Brand-New Menu and Glamourous Look Portsmouth Covid loan company directors âsleepwalkingâ into disqualification Queen Anne departs Southampton for historic maiden world voyage Hampshire County Council urges Government to delay May elections Service of thanksgiving for former Alton mayor Paddy Mendham Southampton death notices: Tributes to 12 people who have died At least 10 confirmed dead in Los Angeles wildfires What's the latest on the LA fires, and what caused them?

"While GCSEs and A-levels are being cancelled, the IGCSE exams will go ahead this summer The IGCSE exams, usually only taken in private schools, are still going ahead this summer - even though GCSEs and A-levels have been cancelled. Exam boards that run IGCSEs plan to offer them, while many other exams have been stopped by the pandemic. IGCSE qualifications, alternative exams to GCSEs, are not usually available in state schools. Pupils in England whose A-levels and GCSEs are cancelled will depend on replacement grades from teachers. But Education Secretary Gavin Williamson's scrapping of exams this summer does not apply to students taking IGCSEs. A Department for Education report in 2019 found 94% of IGCSEs were taken in private schools, accounting for 164,000 exam entries. The decision not to cancel them was welcomed by the Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference (HMC), representing some of the most prestigious independent schools. The HMC's general secretary, Simon Hyde, said their schools ""would be the first to cheer if pupils educated by the state had the same opportunity"". Teachers' grades to be used to replace GCSEs and A-levels Cancelled exams a 'big disappointment' say students Vocational exams to go ahead ""The decision to cancel GCSEs was premature. Exams are the fairest way of assessing what learners know and understand and we would like to see as many pupils as possible take a form of exam in the summer,"" said Dr Hyde. Independent schools often offer a mix of IGCSEs and GCSEs for different subjects, although IGCSEs do not count towards school league tables. The qualifications - International GCSEs - are offered by Cambridge Assessment and Pearson and are taken in other countries as well as the UK. Both boards say they are planning to go ahead with exam papers for UK schools this summer. IGCSEs were not included in the cancellation of exams announced by England's Department for Education and it will be up to individual schools to decide whether to continue with them. Julie McCullloch of the ASCL head teachers' union said: ""It creates another inconsistency, but none of this is easy."" She said it created an ""odd situation"" when GCSEs were cancelled but IGCSEs were going ahead, but she recognised that an international qualification could need a common approach across different countries. With the latest lockdown and most pupils studying at home, GCSEs and A-levels have been cancelled in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. In England, the exams watchdog Ofqual will launch a consultation next week on a replacement way of deciding grades - but Ofqual does not regulate IGCSEs and they will not be part of the watchdog's proposals.

"The UK's Covid vaccine campaign has shifted its focus to boosters - an attempt to reduce the impact of the Omicron variant. Almost seven in 10 of those aged 12 or over in the UK have had a booster, while nine in 10 have had a single jab and more than eight in 10 have had a second dose. But despite more than 38 million boosters, or third doses, being given so far, more people are being urged to come forward and jabs are being rolled out to all five to 11-year-olds. The vaccine rollout was launched in winter 2020 and began with those considered most vulnerable before later moving down the adult age groups. All those aged 12 and over are eligible for two full doses while all five to 11-year-olds are now being offered two low-dose jabs, at least 12 weeks apart. Booster jabs are also available to all over-16s, as well as children aged 12-15 in at-risk groups. The JCVI says a fourth Covid jab is not yet needed because data shows, three months after a booster shot, people aged 65 and over still haveabout 90% protection against hospitalisation. The UK has approved five vaccines for use: Pfizer-BioNTech, Oxford-AstraZeneca, Moderna, Janssen and Novavax; four of which require two doses for maximum protection. Those receiving boosters have so far been receiving one dose of Pfizer or half a dose of Moderna. So far, more than 52 million people have had a first vaccine dose - some 92% of over-12s.  More than 49 million - 85% of over-12s - have had both doses. While uptake of first and second doses dropped off late last year, there was a steep rise in people having boosters. However, booster numbers dipped over the Christmas holiday period and remain low. More than 38 million booster doses have been administered across the UK so far. Overall vaccination rates have now levelled off in every age group in England apart from the youngest bands. The aim of the vaccination programme is toprotect as many people as possible from serious illness,externalthrough developing the UK population's immunity against Covid-19. Data from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) suggests more thannine in 10 adults,externalin the UK now have coronavirus antibodies - which is evidence of a past Covid infection or having received at least one dose of a vaccine. However, this figure does not tell us how many people are protected from infection or how close we are to reaching herd immunity - the point at which everyone is protected, directly or indirectly, as a result of high immunity levels in the population. Will a vaccine give us our old lives back? Is Covid at risk of becoming a disease of the poor? Across the country, there continues to be some variation in the vaccine programme. Scotland has vaccinated 93% of those aged 12 and over with at least one dose, while England and Wales have hit 92% and Northern Ireland 89%. Second doses are also being rolled out, with all nations reaching more than 80% of over-12s so far. Across the English regions, the South West has vaccinated 87% of the same age group with at least one dose, while London has reached 70%. When looking at boosters, the South West has reached 68% of people aged 12 and over, while for London the figure is 46%. There have also been disparities between ethnic groups and poorer and wealthier areas. Analysis of NHS records by theOpenSAFELY group,external- a collaboration between Oxford University and the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine - shows that black people were the least likely to have received a booster vaccine. The study was based on more than 20 million patient records in England and covers people not living in care homes. Areas of London are under-represented in the data. In addition, booster take-up in poorer areas is lower than in more affluent areas. Currently, the Pfizer-BioNTech, Oxford-AstraZeneca, Moderna, Novavax and one-shot Janssen vaccines are approved for use throughout the UK. Others, such that produced by CureVac, have not yet been given the green light. The UK had ordered more than 540 million doses of seven of the most promising vaccines, including the four so far approved for use. In addition, the government has now signed deals to buy 114 million more doses of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines to use in 2022 and 2023. French vaccine maker Valneva said the UK government had scrapped a deal for 100m doses of its vaccine, which is yet to be approved. LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area?

"Covid infections rose by almost a third between 26 December and 3 January, reaching 70,000 new cases a dayaccording to a major study,external. In a different piece of research, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) estimated 1.2 million people in total had Covid over a similar time period. Daily infections are understood to have risen to about 150,000 since then. That would bring daily coronavirus cases above the first peak. The R or reproduction number for the virus is nowbetween 1 and 1.4 for the UK,external, reflecting the sharp rise in cases in recent weeks. SeparateONS data,externalsuggests just under half (44%) of British adults formed a Christmas bubble. These temporary rules let up to three households mix indoors on 25 December -unless they were living in a Tier 4 area. The ONS estimated how much of the population had Covid in the week of 27 December- 2 January: One in 50 in England (upfrom one in 70) One in 70 in Wales (downfrom one in 50) One in 200 in Northern Ireland (upfrom one in 230) One in 115 in Scotland (upfrom one in 145) The ONS data suggests cases rose by three-quarters between its two most recent study periods: 12-18 December and 27 December - 2 January. The ZOE Covid Symptom Study was able to track more recent changes since there was no pause in its research for Christmas. It found the epidemic is growing throughout the UK. Researchers estimate the virus's reproduction or R number is currently 1.2 across the UK. Both sources indicate London has the most severe epidemic with the highest number of cases. Confirmed cases, published on the government's dashboard, are always lower than those in surveys because they mainly reflect the test results of people coming in with symptoms. Both the ONS and ZOE also look at asymptomatic cases - people who may not otherwise get tests. Some asymptomatic testing is now available in the community but it is not being widely taken up. About a fifth of people responding to a separate ONS survey looking at the social impacts of the pandemic, said they had found it difficult to follow the Christmas rules. And half of those gave the fact that they had already made plans as the reason. Rules, which were set to allow everyone in the UK to mix in a five-day window, were changed at the last minute, on 19 December. In England, people living in Tiers 1-3 were allowed to form a one-day Christmas bubble with a maximum of two other households. Those in Tier 4, including about 10 million people in Greater London, were not permitted to mix at all. Mixing was permitted in Scotland and Wales for Christmas Day only.

"This video can not be played London mayor Sadiq Khan: ""Unless the virus reduces... we could run out of beds"" The spread of Covid in London is ""out of control"" according to Sadiq Khan, who has declared a ""major incident"". The coronavirus infection rate in London has exceeded 1,000 per 100,000 people, based on the latest figures from Public Health England. However, the Office for National Statistics recently estimatedas many as one in 30 Londoners,externalhas coronavirus. Mr Khan told BBC political reporter Karl Mercer that the figure is as high as one in 20 in some parts of London. Major incidents have previously been called for the Grenfell Tower fire in June 2017 and the terror attacks at Westminster Bridge and London Bridge. A major incident is any emergency that requires the implementation of special arrangements by one or all of the emergency services, the NHS or the local authority. It means the emergency services and hospitals cannot guarantee their normal level of response. Currently, there are more than 7,000 people in hospital with Covid-19, the mayor said. This is a 35% increase compared to last April's peak of the pandemic, he added. Dr Samantha Batt-Rawden, an ICU registrar and President of the Doctors' Association UK, tweeted: ""We tried. We really tried. NHS staff pleaded with people that Christmas is not worth it. Now one in 30 people in London have Covid and ICUs are overwhelmed. My heart is broken."" An analysis of Public Health England figures show in the week to 3 January, the number of cases rose across all of the London's boroughs compared with the previous week, with 17 individually recording more than 1,000 cases per 100,000 people. Testing increased in parts of the city after a drop over the Christmas period but positivity was high among people taking lab-based tests - suggesting more testing is needed to find undiagnosed cases in the community. In the past week, many parts of the capital saw a rise in deaths where a person had tested positive for coronavirus in the previous 28 days - with some areas recording more than double the number of deaths compared with the previous week. However, reporting over the Christmas period may have affected this. Out of the 18 acute hospital trusts in London providing figures to the government, all of them recorded having more beds being filled by coronavirus patients than in the previous week. Barts NHS Health, one of London's largest trusts, saw a 30% increase in coronavirus patients between 29 December and 5 January, to 830. The London Ambulance Service is now taking up to 8,000 emergency calls a day, the mayor says The mayor of London's announcement comes after the counties ofSussex and Surrey declared similar major incidentson Thursday. He said the London Ambulance Service was currently taking up to 8,000 emergency calls a day, compared to 5,500 on a typical busy day. The London Fire Brigade said more than 100 firefighters had been drafted in to drive ambulances to help cope with the demand. Every frontline agency involved in protecting the public has a legal duty to prepare for emergencies by devising and testing major incident plans. These public bodies declare a major incident when the situation they're confronting is so big or terrible that it's not only likely to cause serious harm, but it will also compromise their ability to respond effectively. In general terms, that means public bodies can legally stop delivering some everyday services, so that their personnel, attention and resources can be diverted to the emergency confronting them. At other times, the plans will lead to the military sending soldiers to aid the civilian effort, as we have seen already during the pandemic. Previous major incidents include the Grenfell Tower disaster in London, the Salisbury Novichok poisonings and the 2017 terrorism attacks. London's regional director for Public Health England Kevin Fenton said the current wave of coronavirus was ""the biggest threat"" the capital has faced in this pandemic to date. Prof Fenton urged Londoners to ""cut contacts"" and ""reduce movements"". He added: ""The emergence of the new variant means we are setting record case rates at almost double the national average, with at least one in 30 people now thought to be carrying the virus. ""We know this will sadly lead to large numbers of deaths, so strong and immediate action is needed."" This video can not be played What does it mean if the NHS is overwhelmed? Mr Khan is warning that London is ""at crisis point"". ""If we do not take immediate action now, our NHS could be overwhelmed and more people will die,"" he said. ""Londoners continue to make huge sacrifices and I am today imploring them to please stay at home unless it is absolutely necessary for you to leave. Stay at home to protect yourself, your family, friends and other Londoners and to protect our NHS."" He said he had written to Prime Minister Boris Johnson asking for more financial support for Londoners who need to self-isolate and are unable to work, and for daily vaccination data. Mr Khan also called for the closure of places of worship and for face masks to be worn routinely outside the home, including in crowded places and supermarket queues, in a bid to curb case numbers. BBC London political correspondent Karl Mercer Two hospital trusts in London have recorded more than 1,000 coronavirus deaths The mayor of London was in a sombre mood when I spoke to him earlier this afternoon. One in 20 Londoners in some areas now has Covid, and there is a real fear that hospitals will simply be overwhelmed in the next two weeks. Declaring a major incident is a real indication of the levels of concern felt not just at City Hall but across London's emergency services and the NHS. More Londoners are now in hospital with coronavirus than at the peak of the first wave last April - and those numbers are growing by more than 800 every day. It's believed the last mayor to declare a London-wide major incident was Boris Johnson in response to the 2011 riots. The coming days will be some of the most challenging in the city's recent history. Katie Sanderson, a junior doctor working in London, said she is worried how long medical staff can cope with the surge of patients. ""[Staff] are working on wards and spending long amounts of time with patients who need high-intensive oxygen therapy,"" she said. ""It is technically challenging and the emotional burden is enormous. I see it in a flatness in their demeanour, like we've all got used to doing things which before were totally inconceivable."" Georgia Gould, chair of London Councils, described London's rising coronavirus rate as ""dangerous"". She added: ""One in 30 Londoners now has Covid. This is why public services across London are urging all Londoners to please stay at home except for absolutely essential shopping and exercise. ""This is a dark and difficult time for our city but there is light at end of the tunnel with the vaccine rollout. We are asking Londoners to come together one last time to stop the spread - lives really do depend on it."" Hunt for vaccine fraudster who injected woman, 92 Everything you need to know about the Covid vaccine in the UK What has coronavirus done to TfL's finances? Earlier this week as the prime minister introduced an England-wide lockdown, the Met Police said officers were going to be""more inquisitive"" towards Londoners seen outside. The Met handed out 1,761 fines for breaches of coronavirus laws between 27 March and 20 December. Deputy Assistant Commissioner Matt Twist said the major incident was a ""stark reminder"" of the point London is at in the pandemic. He said: ""These rule-breakers cannot continue to feign ignorance of the risk that this virus poses or listen to the false information and lies that some promote downplaying the dangers. ""Every time the virus spreads it increases the risk of someone needlessly losing their life."" This video can not be played 'One of the worst shifts of my life - it's overwhelming' In response to Mr Khan's announcement the government said the NHS is continuing to ""face a huge challenge"" A spokeswoman added: ""It is absolutely paramount people in London, and the rest of the country, follow the rules and stay at home to protect the NHS and save lives. ""We are working closely with NHS England to support hospitals in the capital, including additional bed capacity at the London Nightingale. ""Financial support is in place for workers who need to self-isolate - including a Â£500 payment for those on the lowest incomes who have been contacted by NHS Test and Trace.""

"Growing numbers of students in England have pledged to withhold rent on university accommodation they cannot use during the Covid lockdown. Organisers say this is building up to be a major protest, estimating that about 15,000 students at dozens of universities have signed up so far. They want a rebate on rent when many students are being kept off campus at the start of term. But universities say they only provide 20% of student accommodation. Universities UK says this means ""many decisions on refunds will be made by private landlords and other providers"". In November, University of Manchester offereda 30% rent rebate for the first half of the academic year, worth about Â£1,000 to each student in halls. The move followed protests over lack of support during the coronavirus pandemic which saw students tear downtemporary fencing in one demonstration. University of Manchester students have been calling for a rent strike The reduction will be applied to direct debit payments this month, with students who have already paid for the whole year getting a refund. But organiser of the Rent Strike Now campaign, Ben McGowan, said the new lockdown means students are still paying for halls they are unable to return to which has prompted a wave of student anger. On Twitter, campaigners listed more than 40 universities where they said students were pledging to withhold rent. The campaign group Rent Strike Now tweeted a list of universities where there are campaigns ""Most of us are being told not to go back so we're paying for accommodation we can't use and there's been no extra support from universities and government,"" added Saranya Thambiranjah, a first year at Bristol University who also helps run the campaign. ""Rent striking is a great way to make our voices heard and get universities to listen our concerns."" Students at universities not yet part of this campaign have said they will organise similar challenges on their own campuses, including Coventry and Keele. Rebecca Hyde is having to do her journalism course in her bedroom At Nottingham Trent University, student campaigner Rebecca Hyde, who is doing a masters in broadcast journalism, said 244 students had so far pledged to withhold rent on university halls since their campaign was launched a few days ago. She believes universities should do more to help students who are having to pay for rooms they are unable to use through no fault of their own. She says her course leaders have been brilliant but missing out on using studios and running ""news days"" with her fellow students ""is just so disappointing"". Nottingham Trent University says it understands student concerns over rents and urged the government ""to show leadership to find a solution that is fair to all students"". ""At NTU, only a minority of our students are in accommodation operated by or on behalf of the university. ""We do not want a repeat of the situation in the summer term of 2020 where most of our students were reliant on the goodwill of private accommodation providers who did not always do the right thing,"" said the university in a statement. At King's College London, campaign secretary ""Juno"" likewise reported hundreds of new pledges to withhold rent in the past few days, saying students felt they had been ""lured"" into their accommodation  at the start of the academic year. A King's spokesperson promised that students would not be charged for accommodation they are unable to use during lockdown. About a quarter of students are in privately-run purpose built accommodation, and one of the biggest of these providers, Unite Students, is also facing demands. Liverpool John Moores student Suhail Accad, in Unite accommodation, says his rent strike post on Instagram has gained 3,000 followers and has had 8,000 shares in just a few days. ""It's expensive to stay here,"" says Suhail. Unite was unable to comment directly on the threat of rent strikes but maintains that it is doing all it can to help keep students and staff safe ""during this challenging period"". Universities UK said universities were looking at the issue ""actively"" and considering what support they can offer students. ""Universities recognise the financial pressures the pandemic has placed on students and are providing increased financial and other support as a result. ""With government restrictions reducing the numbers of students returning in person to universities, now is the time for the government to seriously consider the financial implications for students and institutions and what support they will provide.""

"Jessica Allen (left) and Eliza Moore are now sticking to walks nearer their homes Two women have described how they were surrounded by police, read their rights and fined Â£200 each after driving five miles to take a walk. The women were also told the hot drinks they had brought along were not allowed as they were ""classed as a picnic"". Guidance for the current lockdown says people can travel for exercise as long as it is in their ""local area"". The police force involved, Derbyshire Police, said driving for exercise was ""not in the spirit"" of lockdown. One of the would-be walkers, Jessica Allen, assumed ""someone had been murdered"" when she arrived at Foremark Reservoir on Wednesday afternoon. Foremark Reservoir is five miles away from where Jessica Allen and Eliza Moore live ""As we drove in there was a police van, a police car, and there were loads of police there,"" said Ms Allen, who lives in Ashby-de-la-Zouch in Leicestershire. ""I genuinely thought someone had been murdered; the place is normally so quiet. The next thing, my car is surrounded. I got out of my car thinking 'There's no way they're coming to speak to us'. Straight away they start questioning us. ""One of them started reading my rights and I was looking at my friend thinking 'This must be a joke'. ""I said we had come in separate cars, even parked two spaces away and even brought our own drinks with us. He said 'You can't do that as it's classed as a picnic'."" Seal sightseeing couple fined for 130-mile trip What can police do to enforce lockdown rules? Covid 'out of control in London', Sadiq Khan says Her friend, Eliza Moore, said she was ""stunned at the time"" so did not challenge police and gave her details so they could send a fixed penalty notice. ""Just seeing a police officer anyway is quite scary for some people and we were really not expecting to be approached and to be told we were doing something wrong,"" she said. ""We don't want to get away with it if we have broken the rule, but it seems a bit unfair that you can be fined on something that's so vague."" Guidance issued by the Cabinet Office,externalstates that people can leave their homes for exercise but should not travel outside their ""local area"". However, the actuallegislation does not specify a maximum distance,externalthat people are allowed to travel for exercise. Both the guidance and legislation state people can exercise with one other person, as Jessica Allen and Eliza Moore did. Human rights barrister Adam Wagner said: ""There is no law against travelling to exercise. The guidance is not legally binding and the police have no power to enforce it unless it is reflected in the lockdown regulations which in this case it is not."" Derbyshire Police said: ""It is up to each individual officer on a case-by-case basis to decide what is reasonable as the legislation does not proscribe a distance."" The BBC contacted the Cabinet Office, Home Office, College of Policing and National Police Chiefs' Council to ask for clarification over what they define as ""local area"" in relation to exercise. None could clarify this. However, the College of Policing said: ""In overall terms police officers across England and Wales will be using their discretion and professional judgement about whether or not someone has a reasonable excuse for travelling for exercise and being outside the place where they are living."" Jessica Allen (right) said walking at the reservoir benefits her mental health during lockdown Ms Allen said she is taking the pandemic ""very seriously"" as her brother is a doctor working on a Covid ward in London, and her parents have both had coronavirus. She said she drove to the reservoir as she knew it would be less crowded than near her house. ""I'm self-employed but my business is closed and I'm trying to fill my time,"" she said. ""I suffer from anxiety and when you go by the water you feel so much better. The only thing I've got to look forward to is planning a walk with my friend."" Ms Allen said the experience was ""very intimidating"" and had left her feeling scared of police in general. ""I was so shook up afterwards,"" she said. ""The fact they read my rights. I thought 'Am I going to prison for going on a walk?' ""I'm not a criminal but we were treated as if we were criminals and it really made me feel for those people who are wrongly arrested and questioned by police, because it wasn't a nice situation to be in."" Jessica Allen, whose brother is a doctor on a Covid ward, went to the reservoir as she knew it would be quiet Derbyshire Police said in a statement: ""Driving to a location - where exercise could easily have been taken closer to a person's home - is clearly not in the spirit of the national effort to reduce our travel, reduce the possible spread of the disease and reduce the number of deaths. ""Each officer will use their professional judgement on a case-by-case basis, however, people should expect to be challenged and understand the clear reasons why they may be asked about their movements given the critical situation the NHS currently finds itself in."" Andrew Bridgen, MP for North West Leicestershire, said he regarded the reservoir as a local area. He tweeted:,external""I'm concerned that my constituents are facing fines from Derbyshire Police for taking exercise in what I would class as the local area. ""It is important that common sense is used when enforcing guidelines, and a fine rather than issuing guidance appears to be rather over zealous."" Derbyshire Police has also been giving fixed penalty notices to people who visit Calke Abbey and Elvaston Castle. Fixed penalty notices have been given to people who visit Calke Abbey, a National Trust property One man said his parents were given a fixed penalty notice after driving seven miles to Calke Abbey from their home in Whitwick, Leicestershire. ""Upon approaching the park there was a team of police officers so my parents decided to pull in and check that no laws were being broken,"" he said. ""Immediately they were hit with a Â£200 fine. When my parents said that they weren't aware this was too far and they'd go home immediately, the police officer simply said 'It's too late'."" Guidance from the College of Policing says officers shouldfollow the ""Four Es"" and only give fixed penalty notices as a last resort,external. When asked about this, Derbyshire Police said: ""The four Es are still in use, however, where there are cases of blatant breaches of the regulations then fines will be issued by officers."" During the first lockdown, the force wascriticised for releasing drone footage of people walking in the Peak District.

"While GCSEs and A-levels are being cancelled, the IGCSE exams will go ahead this summer The IGCSE exams, usually only taken in private schools, are still going ahead this summer - even though GCSEs and A-levels have been cancelled. Exam boards that run IGCSEs plan to offer them, while many other exams have been stopped by the pandemic. IGCSE qualifications, alternative exams to GCSEs, are not usually available in state schools. Pupils in England whose A-levels and GCSEs are cancelled will depend on replacement grades from teachers. But Education Secretary Gavin Williamson's scrapping of exams this summer does not apply to students taking IGCSEs. A Department for Education report in 2019 found 94% of IGCSEs were taken in private schools, accounting for 164,000 exam entries. The decision not to cancel them was welcomed by the Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference (HMC), representing some of the most prestigious independent schools. The HMC's general secretary, Simon Hyde, said their schools ""would be the first to cheer if pupils educated by the state had the same opportunity"". Teachers' grades to be used to replace GCSEs and A-levels Cancelled exams a 'big disappointment' say students Vocational exams to go ahead ""The decision to cancel GCSEs was premature. Exams are the fairest way of assessing what learners know and understand and we would like to see as many pupils as possible take a form of exam in the summer,"" said Dr Hyde. Independent schools often offer a mix of IGCSEs and GCSEs for different subjects, although IGCSEs do not count towards school league tables. The qualifications - International GCSEs - are offered by Cambridge Assessment and Pearson and are taken in other countries as well as the UK. Both boards say they are planning to go ahead with exam papers for UK schools this summer. IGCSEs were not included in the cancellation of exams announced by England's Department for Education and it will be up to individual schools to decide whether to continue with them. Julie McCullloch of the ASCL head teachers' union said: ""It creates another inconsistency, but none of this is easy."" She said it created an ""odd situation"" when GCSEs were cancelled but IGCSEs were going ahead, but she recognised that an international qualification could need a common approach across different countries. With the latest lockdown and most pupils studying at home, GCSEs and A-levels have been cancelled in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. In England, the exams watchdog Ofqual will launch a consultation next week on a replacement way of deciding grades - but Ofqual does not regulate IGCSEs and they will not be part of the watchdog's proposals.

"The number of people in Scotland who have died within 28 days of testing positive for the virus now stands at 4,872 Scotland's hospitals have more Covid patients than ever before - with the number of deaths also ""distressingly high"", the first minister has said. The latest figures showed that the deaths of 93 people who had tested positive for the virus have been recorded in the past 24 hours. But the figure includes some people who died over Christmas and New Year. There were also 1,530 people in hospital with the virus, higher than the peak of 1,520 last April. Of these, 102 patients were in intensive care - with Ms Sturgeon saying the statistics showed the ""severity of the pressure"" that hospitals are facing. The 93 deaths recorded on Friday is the highest daily figure since the outbreak began - with the previous high being 84 on 15 April. How many Covid cases have there been in your area? Third Covid vaccine approved in the UK When will I be vaccinated against Covid? Travellers to UK will need to show negative test But Ms Sturgeon said the figure will ""undoubtedly include some people who died over the Christmas and New Year period and the delay in registration because of the bank holidays means that their deaths are only being reported today."" She added: ""To be clear, that is not more than 90 people who died yesterday. It will be people who have died over a period of time. ""That does not change the fact they are all individuals who have died and have died of Covid."" A further 2,309 people have tested positive for Covid-19, which was 8.1% of the tests carried out on Thursday and takes the total number of cases in Scotland to 146,024. The figures mean that the total number of people in Scotland who have died within 28 days of testing positive for the virus now stands at 4,872. The Scottish government has said it is concerned that too many people have not been following the ""stay at home"" rules that are in place across the whole of the mainland and some islands. It believes that more people are using the country's road and public transport networks than during the lockdown last spring. And it has warned that tougher restrictions could be needed to increase compliance with the travel restrictions. What are the latest Covid rules in Scotland? Ms Sturgeon told her daily briefing that the areas being looked at included non-essential click and collect shopping, further restrictions on takeaway food, non-essential construction and whether more people should be working from home. The first minister also confirmed that universities and colleges will not resume in-person teaching until at least the end of February. This means that students should stay at home rather than travelling back to their campus or accommodation. There will be exceptions for cases where remote study is not possible - for example for a student nurse or a doctor on a practical placement. And Ms Sturgeon said any students who have remained on campus will be ""fully supported"" by their institution. All of mainland Scotland was placed into level four restrictions from 26 December before additional measures, including closing schools to most pupils until at least the end of the month, was introduced on Tuesday. Scotland's interim chief medical officer, Dr Dave Caesar, insisted on Friday morning that coronavirus case numbers in January ""could have been worse"". He said the restrictions that were introduced on Boxing Day had helped to ""blunt the spike"" but warned that the country was ""not out of the woods yet"". Dr Caesar told the BBC'sGood Morning Scotlandprogramme: ""Our case numbers are high, but they're not as high as they could have been if we hadn't taken the measures that we undertook from Boxing Day. ""Our health system is under serious pressure but is coping. ""I hate to say it, but it could have been worse by this time in January. We're not out of the woods yet by any stretch of the imagination, but I suppose we're holding our own in very significantly challenging circumstances."" New Covid testing measures for international travellers are to be introduced New plans tomake international passengers test negative for Covid-19before travelling to Scotland and England have also been unveiled, with Ms Sturgeon saying she hoped the scheme could start by the end of next week. It will mean people arriving by plane, train or boat - including UK nationals - will have to take a test up to 72 hours before leaving the country they are travelling from. Prof Linda Bauld of Edinburgh University said the move was long overdue as the UK had ""really struggled from the beginning"" with limiting the impact of international travel on the pandemic. But she said the country should also consider introducing supervised quarantine for people arriving from overseas. LEVELS:What are the restrictions in your area?

"James Jordan (left) and his younger brother David both tested positive for coronavirus on 30 December The brother of a man who died in his sleep at home with coronavirus is warning people not to ""naively walk into the abyss"" by ignoring symptoms. James Jordan, 40, and his younger brother David, 36, of Salisbury, both tested positive on 30 December. David went to bed with a cough and ""tight chest"" on 2 January but James ""woke up at six in the morning to find him dead in his sleep"". He said he should have ""read"" how his brother was doing and contacted 111. ""That's what we should have done - had we done that he would have gone off to hospital the night before and he'd probably still be with us,"" he said. ""But we just sat there because we thought we were all right because we were relatively young."" Mr Jordan said his brother was a ""big chap but a fit chap"" who swam 80 lengths of the local leisure centre pool each morning. ""He swam Lake Windermere, which is 10 miles long, in a good time a few years ago and completed a middle-distance triathlon with me,"" he said. ""We weren't aware of any underlying health conditions so it's a complete shock."" People dying with Covid aged under 40 remain rare with less than 1% of the UK's deaths being from this age group. On average, for every 3,000 people infected who are aged in their 30s, one person will die with the disease. David Jordan, who worked as a warehouse manager for Woolley and Wallis in Salisbury, was a keen swimmer and runner He said on the night before his brother died, they had been getting ready to isolate and had ordered some shopping to be delivered. ""We were getting set to to just concentrate on staying in and getting fit,"" he said. ""He was coughing quite a lot but beyond that we went off to bed at a sensible sort of time. ""I heard him up at about one o'clock in the morning but when I shouted out to him: 'Are you OK bruv?' he said: 'yeah absolutely fine'. ""I then woke up at six in the morning to find him dead in his sleep."" Mr Jordan he should have ""read"" how his brother was doing and contacted NHS 111 Mr Jordan, a director of Jordan and Mason estate agents in Salisbury, said: ""I don't know how but I should have saved him."" He added: ""I was his big brother and you are supposed to look after little brothers."" He said anyone under the age of 50 has to ""understand that this can affect them as well"" and they should ""be vigilant"". ""I can see others like us naively walking into the abyss because you don't think it applies to you,"" he said. ""In your 30s and 40s you probably are a lot safer but what I'm desperately concerned about is that people ignore it. I know that we did and that's something that we live to regret. ""In hindsight I would have taken professional advice when we should have and that's a regret I will have to live with."" A post-mortem examination into Mr Jordan's death has not yet taken place.

"This video can not be played London mayor Sadiq Khan: ""Unless the virus reduces... we could run out of beds"" The spread of Covid in London is ""out of control"" according to Sadiq Khan, who has declared a ""major incident"". The coronavirus infection rate in London has exceeded 1,000 per 100,000 people, based on the latest figures from Public Health England. However, the Office for National Statistics recently estimatedas many as one in 30 Londoners,externalhas coronavirus. Mr Khan told BBC political reporter Karl Mercer that the figure is as high as one in 20 in some parts of London. Major incidents have previously been called for the Grenfell Tower fire in June 2017 and the terror attacks at Westminster Bridge and London Bridge. A major incident is any emergency that requires the implementation of special arrangements by one or all of the emergency services, the NHS or the local authority. It means the emergency services and hospitals cannot guarantee their normal level of response. Currently, there are more than 7,000 people in hospital with Covid-19, the mayor said. This is a 35% increase compared to last April's peak of the pandemic, he added. Dr Samantha Batt-Rawden, an ICU registrar and President of the Doctors' Association UK, tweeted: ""We tried. We really tried. NHS staff pleaded with people that Christmas is not worth it. Now one in 30 people in London have Covid and ICUs are overwhelmed. My heart is broken."" An analysis of Public Health England figures show in the week to 3 January, the number of cases rose across all of the London's boroughs compared with the previous week, with 17 individually recording more than 1,000 cases per 100,000 people. Testing increased in parts of the city after a drop over the Christmas period but positivity was high among people taking lab-based tests - suggesting more testing is needed to find undiagnosed cases in the community. In the past week, many parts of the capital saw a rise in deaths where a person had tested positive for coronavirus in the previous 28 days - with some areas recording more than double the number of deaths compared with the previous week. However, reporting over the Christmas period may have affected this. Out of the 18 acute hospital trusts in London providing figures to the government, all of them recorded having more beds being filled by coronavirus patients than in the previous week. Barts NHS Health, one of London's largest trusts, saw a 30% increase in coronavirus patients between 29 December and 5 January, to 830. The London Ambulance Service is now taking up to 8,000 emergency calls a day, the mayor says The mayor of London's announcement comes after the counties ofSussex and Surrey declared similar major incidentson Thursday. He said the London Ambulance Service was currently taking up to 8,000 emergency calls a day, compared to 5,500 on a typical busy day. The London Fire Brigade said more than 100 firefighters had been drafted in to drive ambulances to help cope with the demand. Every frontline agency involved in protecting the public has a legal duty to prepare for emergencies by devising and testing major incident plans. These public bodies declare a major incident when the situation they're confronting is so big or terrible that it's not only likely to cause serious harm, but it will also compromise their ability to respond effectively. In general terms, that means public bodies can legally stop delivering some everyday services, so that their personnel, attention and resources can be diverted to the emergency confronting them. At other times, the plans will lead to the military sending soldiers to aid the civilian effort, as we have seen already during the pandemic. Previous major incidents include the Grenfell Tower disaster in London, the Salisbury Novichok poisonings and the 2017 terrorism attacks. London's regional director for Public Health England Kevin Fenton said the current wave of coronavirus was ""the biggest threat"" the capital has faced in this pandemic to date. Prof Fenton urged Londoners to ""cut contacts"" and ""reduce movements"". He added: ""The emergence of the new variant means we are setting record case rates at almost double the national average, with at least one in 30 people now thought to be carrying the virus. ""We know this will sadly lead to large numbers of deaths, so strong and immediate action is needed."" This video can not be played What does it mean if the NHS is overwhelmed? Mr Khan is warning that London is ""at crisis point"". ""If we do not take immediate action now, our NHS could be overwhelmed and more people will die,"" he said. ""Londoners continue to make huge sacrifices and I am today imploring them to please stay at home unless it is absolutely necessary for you to leave. Stay at home to protect yourself, your family, friends and other Londoners and to protect our NHS."" He said he had written to Prime Minister Boris Johnson asking for more financial support for Londoners who need to self-isolate and are unable to work, and for daily vaccination data. Mr Khan also called for the closure of places of worship and for face masks to be worn routinely outside the home, including in crowded places and supermarket queues, in a bid to curb case numbers. BBC London political correspondent Karl Mercer Two hospital trusts in London have recorded more than 1,000 coronavirus deaths The mayor of London was in a sombre mood when I spoke to him earlier this afternoon. One in 20 Londoners in some areas now has Covid, and there is a real fear that hospitals will simply be overwhelmed in the next two weeks. Declaring a major incident is a real indication of the levels of concern felt not just at City Hall but across London's emergency services and the NHS. More Londoners are now in hospital with coronavirus than at the peak of the first wave last April - and those numbers are growing by more than 800 every day. It's believed the last mayor to declare a London-wide major incident was Boris Johnson in response to the 2011 riots. The coming days will be some of the most challenging in the city's recent history. Katie Sanderson, a junior doctor working in London, said she is worried how long medical staff can cope with the surge of patients. ""[Staff] are working on wards and spending long amounts of time with patients who need high-intensive oxygen therapy,"" she said. ""It is technically challenging and the emotional burden is enormous. I see it in a flatness in their demeanour, like we've all got used to doing things which before were totally inconceivable."" Georgia Gould, chair of London Councils, described London's rising coronavirus rate as ""dangerous"". She added: ""One in 30 Londoners now has Covid. This is why public services across London are urging all Londoners to please stay at home except for absolutely essential shopping and exercise. ""This is a dark and difficult time for our city but there is light at end of the tunnel with the vaccine rollout. We are asking Londoners to come together one last time to stop the spread - lives really do depend on it."" Hunt for vaccine fraudster who injected woman, 92 Everything you need to know about the Covid vaccine in the UK What has coronavirus done to TfL's finances? Earlier this week as the prime minister introduced an England-wide lockdown, the Met Police said officers were going to be""more inquisitive"" towards Londoners seen outside. The Met handed out 1,761 fines for breaches of coronavirus laws between 27 March and 20 December. Deputy Assistant Commissioner Matt Twist said the major incident was a ""stark reminder"" of the point London is at in the pandemic. He said: ""These rule-breakers cannot continue to feign ignorance of the risk that this virus poses or listen to the false information and lies that some promote downplaying the dangers. ""Every time the virus spreads it increases the risk of someone needlessly losing their life."" This video can not be played 'One of the worst shifts of my life - it's overwhelming' In response to Mr Khan's announcement the government said the NHS is continuing to ""face a huge challenge"" A spokeswoman added: ""It is absolutely paramount people in London, and the rest of the country, follow the rules and stay at home to protect the NHS and save lives. ""We are working closely with NHS England to support hospitals in the capital, including additional bed capacity at the London Nightingale. ""Financial support is in place for workers who need to self-isolate - including a Â£500 payment for those on the lowest incomes who have been contacted by NHS Test and Trace.""

"Growing numbers of students in England have pledged to withhold rent on university accommodation they cannot use during the Covid lockdown. Organisers say this is building up to be a major protest, estimating that about 15,000 students at dozens of universities have signed up so far. They want a rebate on rent when many students are being kept off campus at the start of term. But universities say they only provide 20% of student accommodation. Universities UK says this means ""many decisions on refunds will be made by private landlords and other providers"". In November, University of Manchester offereda 30% rent rebate for the first half of the academic year, worth about Â£1,000 to each student in halls. The move followed protests over lack of support during the coronavirus pandemic which saw students tear downtemporary fencing in one demonstration. University of Manchester students have been calling for a rent strike The reduction will be applied to direct debit payments this month, with students who have already paid for the whole year getting a refund. But organiser of the Rent Strike Now campaign, Ben McGowan, said the new lockdown means students are still paying for halls they are unable to return to which has prompted a wave of student anger. On Twitter, campaigners listed more than 40 universities where they said students were pledging to withhold rent. The campaign group Rent Strike Now tweeted a list of universities where there are campaigns ""Most of us are being told not to go back so we're paying for accommodation we can't use and there's been no extra support from universities and government,"" added Saranya Thambiranjah, a first year at Bristol University who also helps run the campaign. ""Rent striking is a great way to make our voices heard and get universities to listen our concerns."" Students at universities not yet part of this campaign have said they will organise similar challenges on their own campuses, including Coventry and Keele. Rebecca Hyde is having to do her journalism course in her bedroom At Nottingham Trent University, student campaigner Rebecca Hyde, who is doing a masters in broadcast journalism, said 244 students had so far pledged to withhold rent on university halls since their campaign was launched a few days ago. She believes universities should do more to help students who are having to pay for rooms they are unable to use through no fault of their own. She says her course leaders have been brilliant but missing out on using studios and running ""news days"" with her fellow students ""is just so disappointing"". Nottingham Trent University says it understands student concerns over rents and urged the government ""to show leadership to find a solution that is fair to all students"". ""At NTU, only a minority of our students are in accommodation operated by or on behalf of the university. ""We do not want a repeat of the situation in the summer term of 2020 where most of our students were reliant on the goodwill of private accommodation providers who did not always do the right thing,"" said the university in a statement. At King's College London, campaign secretary ""Juno"" likewise reported hundreds of new pledges to withhold rent in the past few days, saying students felt they had been ""lured"" into their accommodation  at the start of the academic year. A King's spokesperson promised that students would not be charged for accommodation they are unable to use during lockdown. About a quarter of students are in privately-run purpose built accommodation, and one of the biggest of these providers, Unite Students, is also facing demands. Liverpool John Moores student Suhail Accad, in Unite accommodation, says his rent strike post on Instagram has gained 3,000 followers and has had 8,000 shares in just a few days. ""It's expensive to stay here,"" says Suhail. Unite was unable to comment directly on the threat of rent strikes but maintains that it is doing all it can to help keep students and staff safe ""during this challenging period"". Universities UK said universities were looking at the issue ""actively"" and considering what support they can offer students. ""Universities recognise the financial pressures the pandemic has placed on students and are providing increased financial and other support as a result. ""With government restrictions reducing the numbers of students returning in person to universities, now is the time for the government to seriously consider the financial implications for students and institutions and what support they will provide.""

"While GCSEs and A-levels are being cancelled, the IGCSE exams will go ahead this summer The IGCSE exams, usually only taken in private schools, are still going ahead this summer - even though GCSEs and A-levels have been cancelled. Exam boards that run IGCSEs plan to offer them, while many other exams have been stopped by the pandemic. IGCSE qualifications, alternative exams to GCSEs, are not usually available in state schools. Pupils in England whose A-levels and GCSEs are cancelled will depend on replacement grades from teachers. But Education Secretary Gavin Williamson's scrapping of exams this summer does not apply to students taking IGCSEs. A Department for Education report in 2019 found 94% of IGCSEs were taken in private schools, accounting for 164,000 exam entries. The decision not to cancel them was welcomed by the Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference (HMC), representing some of the most prestigious independent schools. The HMC's general secretary, Simon Hyde, said their schools ""would be the first to cheer if pupils educated by the state had the same opportunity"". Teachers' grades to be used to replace GCSEs and A-levels Cancelled exams a 'big disappointment' say students Vocational exams to go ahead ""The decision to cancel GCSEs was premature. Exams are the fairest way of assessing what learners know and understand and we would like to see as many pupils as possible take a form of exam in the summer,"" said Dr Hyde. Independent schools often offer a mix of IGCSEs and GCSEs for different subjects, although IGCSEs do not count towards school league tables. The qualifications - International GCSEs - are offered by Cambridge Assessment and Pearson and are taken in other countries as well as the UK. Both boards say they are planning to go ahead with exam papers for UK schools this summer. IGCSEs were not included in the cancellation of exams announced by England's Department for Education and it will be up to individual schools to decide whether to continue with them. Julie McCullloch of the ASCL head teachers' union said: ""It creates another inconsistency, but none of this is easy."" She said it created an ""odd situation"" when GCSEs were cancelled but IGCSEs were going ahead, but she recognised that an international qualification could need a common approach across different countries. With the latest lockdown and most pupils studying at home, GCSEs and A-levels have been cancelled in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. In England, the exams watchdog Ofqual will launch a consultation next week on a replacement way of deciding grades - but Ofqual does not regulate IGCSEs and they will not be part of the watchdog's proposals.

"Police named the victim as 19-year-old Kaelah Marlow A young woman has died after a rare suspected shark attack in New Zealand. Police named the victim as 19-year-old Kaelah Marlow, from Hamilton. Marlow was taken out of the water still alive but died at the scene despite efforts to save her life. Police said it appeared she had been injured by a shark. The attack happened at Waihi Beach on North Island not far from the country's biggest city Auckland. ""Police extend our deepest sympathies to Kaelah's family and loved ones at this very difficult time,"" police said in a statement. ""We appreciate her death was extremely traumatic for those who were at Waihi Beach yesterday and we are offering victim support services to anyone who requires it,"" the statement said. Shark attacks are unusual in the country and this is thought to be the first fatality since 2013. Local media cited witnesses as saying the woman had been swimming right in front of the lifeguard flags on Thursday. When they heard screams, lifeguards went out by boat immediately and pulled her to shore. How do you stop sharks attacking? Shark attack was like 'being hit by a truck' It is not clear what kind of shark attacked Kaelah Marlow, but an eyewitness reportedly claimed it was a great white, a species which is protected in the waters around New Zealand. ""Sharks are reasonably common near all northern beaches of New Zealand, most are harmless and even species considered dangerous very rarely interact with swimmers,"" shark researcher Kina Scollay told the BBC. ""My thoughts and sympathies are with the victim's family and we need to remember that this is a real tragedy to real people. I worry that this gets lost sight of in the media scramble after such events."" One witness quoted by local media said he believed a great white shark attacked the woman Mr Scolley said that while attacks were rare, there were ways to be careful about interactions that could go wrong. Among the risk factors are, for instance, fish feeding events or dead animals in the water. ""If a large shark approaches or is seen nearby people should stay calm, warn those nearby and calmly exit the water,"" he said. A seven-day rahui, a traditional Maori prohibition restricting access to an area, has been placed on the beach. The last recorded shark attack was in 2018 when a man was injured - but survived  - at Baylys Beach. Over the past 170 years, there have only been 13 fatal shark attacks documented in New Zealand,according to the country's department of conservation.,external This video can not be played The shark net debate Shark attack was like 'being hit by a truck' Man killed by shark in Western Australia At least 10 confirmed dead in Los Angeles wildfires What's the latest on the LA fires, and what caused them?

"Stormont ministers have clashed over the planned school transfer test scheduled for next month. Sinn FÃ©in, SDLP and Alliance ministers argued the test run by the Association for Quality Education (AQE) should not go ahead due to the Covid-19 crisis. DUP leader and First Minister Arlene Foster, who chaired the meeting, rejected a call to put it to a vote. It was agreed that Education Minister Peter Weir would present a paper on the issue at a future meeting. The exchanges at the executive have been described as ""tense"" by some observers. Speaking on Friday evening, Mrs Foster said it was ""about parental choice"" and if parents wished to pursue academic selection, it was ""a legal route"". She said ""using Covid as an excuse"" to try and get rid of academic selection, was ""very, very wrong"". Mrs Foster said it was important to prevent the misuse of the executive's any-other-business function, and ""that is why today's vote could not happen"". ""Other parties wanted it to happen,"" she said. Mrs Foster said Stormont rules prevented an executive vote on stopping February's transfer test from going ahead ""If you allowed that to happen, then any majority of ministers could come along, and raise any sort of issue without having looked at the policy implications, or the procedures."" The attempt during the meeting at Stormont to halt the test was opposed by DUP ministers, who accused others of using the coronavirus crisis to attack grammar schools which use it. The ministers who wanted the test to be cancelled insisted their position was not linked to the wider debate about academic selection in Northern Ireland. The issue was raised during the any-other-business section of the meeting and First Minister Mrs Foster said that Stormont rules prevented a vote on substantive matters discussed during that time. Later Sinn FÃ©in minister Deirdre Hargey said: ""Unfortunately there was a decision taken today by some not to allow a vote to take place on this issue. ""I feel there would have been parties that would have clearly backed my position and understand the concerns around this. ""I do see that some of the grammar schools under AQE have moved, in not going ahead with academic selection. I commend the leadership that they have shown. I hope that others can follow in that leadership."" The transfer test has long been a controversial issue, with some political parties opposing its use Meanwhile, four grammar schools, Royal School Dungannon, Belfast Royal Academy, Victoria College and Campbell College have said they will not be using the AQE test to admit pupils this year. However Campbell College said it is obliged to host an AQE test if it goes ahead. Strabane Academy had already announced on Wednesday that it would not facilitate the additional test and would instead apply contingency criteria. There has been controversy throughout this week about whether the transfer test should go ahead as lockdown restrictions tightened in Northern Ireland. It is used by the majority of Northern Ireland grammar schools to select pupils. AQE plans to hold transfer test in February Post-primary transfer tests cancelled in NI The first in a series of tests was due to take place on Saturday but on Tuesday the exam providers said that would not happen. One provider cancelled its test while another - the AQE - said it wasmoving its test to a single sitting in February. On Friday, three of the 34 schools that normally use the test said they would not be proceeding with it this year. Royal School Dungannon (RSD) in County Tyrone, one of Northern Ireland's oldest grammar schools, told parents of primary seven pupils in the area that its governers had ""unanimously decided"" against using the test. Royal School Dungannon said its decision not to use the test was in children's ""best interests"" The school was established in 1614 and has about 650 pupils. In its letter to parents, the school said it still supported the principle of academic selection but would use its ""contingency admissions criteria"" for admitting pupils to year eight in September. ""Our most important consideration was giving certainty to P7 pupils and families during the Covid-19 public health crisis,"" said the school. ""The AQE test will therefore not take place at RSD on 27 February."" It added: ""We realise that the children have worked hard in preparing for the tests and that this is not how any of us would have wanted the transfer process to have worked this year."" It said its decision was ""in the best interests of the children's immediate welfare and their longer term prospects of success"". The school said its contingency admissions criteria would soon be available on its website. Victoria College said AQE would contact with parents about alternative testing arrangements Some grammar schools have already published criteriafor how they would admit pupils if the transfer test does not take place. Two Belfast schools have also pulled out of using the test. Victoria College said it ""did not consider it appropriate"" to run academic selection this year in the interests of the ""safety, health and wellbeing of parents, pupils and staff"". ""We understand fully that this is an emotive and divisive issue and that whilst this news will be welcomed by some it will cause anxiety for others,"" a letter from the school board read. The school said it would review its contingency admissions criteria and publish it ""in due course"". Belfast Royal Academy has also decided against using the test this year, saying it hoped the move would ""alleviate any further anxiety"" for children and their parents. The school said it would publish its contingency admissions criteria on Monday.

Thank you for reading. The team was Alex Therrien, Mary O'Connor, Alexandra Fouche, Kevin Ponniah, Max Matza, Owen Amos, and James Clarke. We're pausing our live coverage of the coronavirus pandemic for today. It's been a busy day in the UK - here's a roundup of the day's top headlines: Richmond upon Thames was the one area in England not to see a rise in cases All but one of England's 315 local areas have seen a recent rise in coronavirus case rates, figures released today show. Richmond upon Thames, in south-west London, was the one exception, with a fall in infections. The figures, for the seven days to 4 January, are based on tests carried out in laboratories (pillar one of the government's testing programme) and in the wider community (pillar two). Barking & Dagenham in London continues to have the highest rate in England, with 1,687.1 cases per 100,000 people - up from 1,150.3 in the seven days to 28 December. Redbridge, also in London, has the second highest rate, up from 1,166.4 to 1,559.2. Thurrock in Essex has the third highest rate, up from 1,252.1 to 1,540.1. Richmond upon Thames has 629.7 - down from 639.3. If you're just joining us, here's a roundup of today's international headlines: Throughout the pandemic, the BBC is working hard to answer your questions on everything from vaccines to the latest rules where you live. New lockdowns are now in force in England and most of Scotland, as well as Wales and Northern Ireland. Tina Howson from Leicester asks: My elderly mum is my support bubble but she does not live locally (about a 90-minute drive away). Am I still allowed to go to see her? Find out how the BBC answered Tina's question - and others asked since then -here. A number of sporting fixtures in the UK have been cancelled after players tested positive for coronavirus. Among them are the FA Cup third round clash between Southampton and Shrewsbury and rugby union's Premiership game between Northampton Saints and Leicester Tigers - both of which were due to take place on Saturday. Other sides will field reserve or youth teams after their first team were forced to isolate. You can check the full list of affected fixtures, which the BBC will update,here. Meanwhile,Newcastle boss Steve Bruce has said it is ""morally wrong"" for football to continueamid increasing coronavirus outbreaks at clubs. The Magpies were the first team to have a Premier League match postponed this season, but more than 60 games in England have been called off. ""Financially it's right to play on, but for me, morally, it's probably wrong,"" said Bruce. ""I understand people want to see a game of football but we are just as vulnerable as everybody else."" Prof Chris Whitty will front one of the adverts The government is urging people in England to stay at home and ""act like you've got it"" as part of a new advertising campaign. The ""stay at home, save lives"" campaign will run across TV, radio, out-of-home advertising and social media. The campaign will include a new advert fronted by England's Chief Medical Officer, Prof Chris Whitty, which will air for the first time on ITV at 19:15 GMT tonight. The UK reported arecord number of deaths and casestoday, as hospitals come under growing pressure, with some in the South East at extreme capacity. Around one in three people with Covid-19 donât have any symptoms and can pass it on without realising, the government said, ""which is why itâs essential everyone stays at home and remembers Hands, Face, Space"". Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: ""Our hospitals are under more pressure than at any other time since the start of the pandemic, and infection rates across the entire country continue to soar at an alarming rate. âThe vaccine has given us renewed hope in our fight against the virus but we must not be complacent. ""The NHS is under severe strain and we must take action to protect it, both so our doctors and nurses can continue to save lives and so they can vaccinate as many people as possible as quickly as we can. âI know the last year has taken its toll â but your compliance is now more vital than ever. So once again, I must urge everyone to stay at home, protect the NHS and save lives.â Kevin PeacheyPersonal finance reporter England's eviction ban has been extended for six weeks, following a similar move in Scotland on Thursday. The move will mean eviction notices - which could have started again on Monday - will not be served on tenants during lockdown. It follows calls from charities for more financial support for tenants. Councils are also being given extra funding to house rough sleepers during the cold winter months. They will be asked to go back to people on the streets who had previously refused help, given the rising Covid infection rates.

Maddy SavageBBC News, Stockholm Unlike many European leaders, Prime Minister Stefan LÃ¶fven has so far decided against a national lockdown As we reported at 12:01 GMT, Swedenâs parliament has agreed a new pandemic law allowing ministers to introduce stricter measures in the country. Within hours of the law being passed, Prime
Minister Stefan LÃ¶fven announced plans to limit numbers in gyms,
swimming pools and shops in relation to how big they are. Managers will need to
make sure thereâs at least 10 square metres available per person. The Social
Democrat leader also says there will be a ban of more than eight people at
bookable private party venues - from dining halls to common rooms in apartment
blocks. There is already a ban on holding public events for more than eight
people, such as concerts, plays or demonstrations. The law comes into force on
Sunday. Those who break new rules emerging from the legislation will face a
fine - with businesses told they may also be forced to close. Philippa RoxbyHealth reporter, BBC News The number of deaths with Covid-19 reported for the UK today has hita new high of 1,325. Even in the first peak of the pandemic, the daily record was 1,224 (on 21 April). It is a sad and sobering figure â and the grim truth is that the next few weeks are likely to see even more people dying and that figure rising further. That is because cases are continuing to rise, which means hospitals will fill up with more Covid patients, leading to the most seriously ill dying in several weeksâ time. It is an unstoppable trend. Of course, not all those 1,325 deaths happened today. This figure includes deaths that happened mostly over the past few days â but some will have occurred even earlier and a few before Christmas, and will only have been reported today. This lag in recording and reporting deaths over Christmas is why the deaths figures in the past three days have been over 1,000. A more even spread of deaths occurring every day is likely to be seen when we look back at the figures in several weeksâ time. But it doesnât take away from the fact that nearly 80,000 people have now died with Covid-19 in the UK.

As these graphics show, wealthier countries have made the quickest start on vaccinations - although not all countries are reporting data. Earlier this afternoon, the UK reported 1,325 coronavirus deaths within 28 days of a positive test - the highest daily figure of the pandemic. But Dr William Welfare, director for the Covid-19 response at Public Health England, says the daily death toll is likely to continue to rise. He says: âEach life lost to this virus is a tragedy, but sadly we can expect the death toll to continue to rise until we stop the spread. âApproximately one-in-three people who have coronavirus have no symptoms and could be spreading it without realising it. âTo protect our loved ones it is essential we all stay at home where possible. This will reduce new infections, ease the pressure on the NHS and save lives.â  Some Canadian snowbirds - retired people who travel south for the winter - are finding they are able to get vaccinations in Florida earlier than they could if they remained at home.

We're pausing our live coverage of the coronavirus pandemic for today. It's been a busy day in the UK - here's a roundup of the day's top headlines: Richmond upon Thames was the one area in England not to see a rise in cases All but one of England's 315 local areas have seen a recent rise in coronavirus case rates, figures released today show. Richmond upon Thames, in south-west London, was the one exception, with a fall in infections. The figures, for the seven days to 4 January, are based on tests carried out in laboratories (pillar one of the government's testing programme) and in the wider community (pillar two). Barking & Dagenham in London continues to have the highest rate in England, with 1,687.1 cases per 100,000 people - up from 1,150.3 in the seven days to 28 December. Redbridge, also in London, has the second highest rate, up from 1,166.4 to 1,559.2. Thurrock in Essex has the third highest rate, up from 1,252.1 to 1,540.1. Richmond upon Thames has 629.7 - down from 639.3. If you're just joining us, here's a roundup of today's international headlines: Throughout the pandemic, the BBC is working hard to answer your questions on everything from vaccines to the latest rules where you live. New lockdowns are now in force in England and most of Scotland, as well as Wales and Northern Ireland. Tina Howson from Leicester asks: My elderly mum is my support bubble but she does not live locally (about a 90-minute drive away). Am I still allowed to go to see her? Find out how the BBC answered Tina's question - and others asked since then -here. A number of sporting fixtures in the UK have been cancelled after players tested positive for coronavirus. Among them are the FA Cup third round clash between Southampton and Shrewsbury and rugby union's Premiership game between Northampton Saints and Leicester Tigers - both of which were due to take place on Saturday. Other sides will field reserve or youth teams after their first team were forced to isolate. You can check the full list of affected fixtures, which the BBC will update,here. Meanwhile,Newcastle boss Steve Bruce has said it is ""morally wrong"" for football to continueamid increasing coronavirus outbreaks at clubs. The Magpies were the first team to have a Premier League match postponed this season, but more than 60 games in England have been called off. ""Financially it's right to play on, but for me, morally, it's probably wrong,"" said Bruce. ""I understand people want to see a game of football but we are just as vulnerable as everybody else."" Prof Chris Whitty will front one of the adverts The government is urging people in England to stay at home and ""act like you've got it"" as part of a new advertising campaign. The ""stay at home, save lives"" campaign will run across TV, radio, out-of-home advertising and social media. The campaign will include a new advert fronted by England's Chief Medical Officer, Prof Chris Whitty, which will air for the first time on ITV at 19:15 GMT tonight. The UK reported arecord number of deaths and casestoday, as hospitals come under growing pressure, with some in the South East at extreme capacity. Around one in three people with Covid-19 donât have any symptoms and can pass it on without realising, the government said, ""which is why itâs essential everyone stays at home and remembers Hands, Face, Space"". Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: ""Our hospitals are under more pressure than at any other time since the start of the pandemic, and infection rates across the entire country continue to soar at an alarming rate. âThe vaccine has given us renewed hope in our fight against the virus but we must not be complacent. ""The NHS is under severe strain and we must take action to protect it, both so our doctors and nurses can continue to save lives and so they can vaccinate as many people as possible as quickly as we can. âI know the last year has taken its toll â but your compliance is now more vital than ever. So once again, I must urge everyone to stay at home, protect the NHS and save lives.â Kevin PeacheyPersonal finance reporter England's eviction ban has been extended for six weeks, following a similar move in Scotland on Thursday. The move will mean eviction notices - which could have started again on Monday - will not be served on tenants during lockdown. It follows calls from charities for more financial support for tenants. Councils are also being given extra funding to house rough sleepers during the cold winter months. They will be asked to go back to people on the streets who had previously refused help, given the rising Covid infection rates.

"Google's plan to replace web browser cookies with a system that shares less data with advertisers is being investigated in the UK. The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) said Google's plan could have a ""significant impact"" on news websites and the digital advertising market. It hadalready raised concerns that publishers' profits could sink,externalif they were unable to run personalised ads. But Google said digital advertising practices had to ""evolve"". Cookies are small files a web browser stores on a user's device when they visit a webpage. They can be used to remember what items a person has added to their online basket and deliver personalised content. They can also be used to track somebody's activity online and deliver targeted advertising. Some cookies known as cross-site or third-party cookies can let publishers track a person's web activity as they move from one website to another. By default, Apple's Safari and Mozilla's Firefox browsers already block cross-site cookies. But Google intends to go further by ending support for all cookies except first-party ones - those used by sites to track activity within their own pages. It wants to replace them with new tools that give advertisers more limited, anonymised information such as how many users visited a promoted product's page after seeing a relevant ad - but not tie this information to individual users. According to one industry group opposing the move, Google's Chrome browser is installed on more than 70% of computers in the UK. So even if other web browsers do not adopt the same approach the move would still be significant. ""Google's Privacy Sandbox proposals will potentially have a very significant impact on publishers like newspapers, and the digital advertising market. But there are also privacy concerns to consider,"" saidAndrea Coscelli, chief executive of the CMA,external. A coalition of about a dozen small tech companies and publishers - Marketers for an Open Web (Mow) - claims some of its members' revenues could drop by as much as two-thirds. Moreover, it suggests the move would put too much power into Google's hands. ""Google will effectively control how websites can monetise and operate their business,"" it warned last month. ""This means that any business that buys or sells advertising will be reliant on Google for a part of the process, whether they like it or not. ""This will reduce the ability of independent players to compete with Google, strengthening its monopoly control of online commerce."" The group has also raised concerns about other related matters, including the tech firm's plan to end support for user-agent strings. These are bits of text that browsers send to websites at the start of a user's visit to reveal details about the device and browser being used. Publishers use this information to optimise the way their sites appear. But Google is phasing out support on the grounds that they are also used as an alternative to cookies to track users, and sometimes cause compatibility issues. The CMA previously issued a report into the matter in July. Nvidia takeover of chip designer Arm investigated UK plans tailored set of rules for each tech giant UK to impose new rules to limit tech giants' power At that point it acknowledged that while there were benefits to consumers from the kinds of privacy measures Google was proposing, they might be outweighed by other concerns. It added that ""many news publishers"" had expressed concern that their news sites would become ""unsustainable"". Until recently, the European Commission was responsible for most large and complex competition cases involving the UK. On 1 January, the CMA tookover these responsibilities on a local level due to Brexit,external. Last November, the government announced itwould create a new Digital Markets Unit within the CMA,external.

The new unit becomes operational in April, but is dependent on legislation going through Parliament before it gets new powers, and that may not happen until 2022. Since that would be too late to block Google's Privacy Sandbox plans, the probe is being carried out under the existing regime.

"Democrats plan to start impeachment proceedings against Donald Trump on Monday, for inciting the invasion of the US Capitol It is extremely unlikely the proceedings would clear Congress, but they could be a symbolic gesture House speaker Nancy Pelosi said she had also spoken to the military about precautions to prevent Mr Trump ordering a war or nuclear strike 'I will not be going to the inauguration"" - Donald Trump says he will break custom and snub Joe Biden's swearing-in on 20 January Five people have died in relation to the riot, including Brian Sicknick, a US Capitol Police officer Several people have been charged in connection with the violence, including a politician from West Virginia Edited by Alix Kroeger We're pausing our live coverage on the
aftermath of Wednesday's events at the US Capitol for now. Thanks for reading. The majority of Americans questioned (57%) said they thought President Donald Trump should be immediately removed from office following events in the Capitol on Wednesday, a Reuters/Ipsos poll suggests. As many as seven out of 10 Trump supporters - those who voted for Trump in November's presidential election - who participated in the national public opinion survey on Thursday and Friday condemned the violence, which led to the deaths of four civilians and a police officer. The poll useda sample of 1,005 Americans aged 18 or over.,externalThe sample included 490 Democrat voters, 363 Republican voters and a number of independent voters. The siege at the Capitol, as US Congress attempted to certify Joe Biden's victory in the presidential election, took place just hours after Trump addressed supporters and told them: ""We will never give up; we will never concede."" Following Wednesdayâs events,
there's been much discussion about whether Trump can be removed
from office, as Democrats are demanding. There are two ways that this
could be done. 25th amendment The 25th
amendment to the constitution allows the vice-president to become acting president when a sitting president
is deemed unable to continue his or her duties. Section four of the
amendment allows the vice-president and a majority of the cabinet to make this determination. Impeachment For a president to be impeached, charges must first be brought to the House and passed in a simple majority vote. It's possible the Democrats could do this next week, making Trump the first president in history to be impeached twice. Proceedings then move to the Senate but it's seen as unlikely that there would be enough time to complete the trial there. Even if this did happen, a two-thirds majority is required to vote for a president's removal, which would involve a lot of Republicans having to support it. We've put together a guide on these processes, if you'd like to read it. The FBI earlier released this image of a suspect wanted in connection with the planting of suspected pipe bombs in Washington The FBI is offering a reward of up to $50,000 (Â£37,000) for information as investigators try to track down those responsible for planting two pipe bombs in Republican and Democratic party headquarters during the attack on the US Capitol. Police received reports of suspected devices on Wednesday. Today, the FBI said in a statement that rewards would be issued on information that leads to ""the location, arrest and conviction"" of suspects. Bomb technicians used water cannon,externalto break the devices apart and render them harmless during the riots in Washington DC, ABC News reported. While rioters in the nation's capital made headlines, Trump supporters rallied at state capitols across America to protest against the election results. In the state of Washington, a crowd marched from the capitol and broke in to the grounds of the governor's mansion. This video can not be played How protests swept across the US In a break with her party, Republican Alaska Senator Lisa Murkowski says it's time for Trump to leave. ""He has caused enough damage,â Murkowskitold the Anchorage Daily News on Friday.,external ""I think he should leave. He said heâs not going to show up. Heâs not going to appear at the inauguration. He hasnât been focused on what is going on with Covid,"" she said. The senator added that Trump has been either golfing or ""fuming and throwing every single person who has been loyal and faithful to him under the bus"" - including Vice-President Mike Pence. ""He only wants to stay there for his ego. He needs to get out. He needs to do the good thing, but I donât think heâs capable of doing a good thing."" When asked about her ties to the Republican Party, Murkowski said: ""If the Republican Party has become nothing more than the party of Trump, I sincerely question whether this is the party for me."" Our North America reporter Anthony Zurcher noted that Murkowski won her senate race as a write-in candidate, and could survive without the Republican Party. A prominent left-wing activist from Utah was among the pro-Trump mob, according to multiple videos from Wednesday's invasion of the Capitol. But John Sullivan, 26, says he was just there to ""document"" it. Sullivan is the founder of Insurgence USA, which calls itself ""a group for racial justice and police reform"". In a series of media appearances after the riot, he defended his involvement, saying it was important for people ""to see the truth"" and ""see it raw"". When air force veteran and Trump supporter Ashli Babbitt was shot inside the building - the first known casualty of the violence - Sullivan and an associate were at close range. They later provided video to the Washington Post. Sullivan - who currently faces two criminal charges that stem from a separate protest in Utah - also spoke to major media outlets, including CNN and Fox News, on Wednesday and Thursday. Following these appearances, he was briefly detained by DC police, but he does not appear to have been arrested and formally charged for his role in the security breach. On the heels of the impeachment news, the White House has responded by saying this is a time for coming together. ""As President Trump said yesterday, this is a time for healing and unity as one nation,"" a White House statement to CNN reads. ""A politically motivated impeachment against a president with 12 days remaining in his term will only serve to further divide our great country."" Here's more on those impending impeachment articles. According to a four-page draft posted by NBC News, the first charge against Trump is ""incitement of insurrection"". ""Donald John Trump engaged in high Crimes and Misdemeanors by willfully inciting violence against the Government of the United States,"" the draft reads. The lawmakers accuse the president of making statements that encouraged and resulted in ""imminent lawless action at the Capitol"". The draft also says this was ""consistent with his prior efforts to subvert and obstruct"" the certification of President-elect Joe Biden's win. ""He thereby betrayed his trust as President, to the manifest injury of the people of the United States."" Three Democrats - Congressmen Ted Lieu, David Cicilline and Jamie Raskin - are planning on introducing articles of impeachment against President Trump on Monday. Articles of impeachment are charges brought against a president by the House of Rperesentatives. If the House votes to pass them, proceedings move to the Senate, which decides whether or not to convict. CBS News, the BBC's US partner, reports that the bill has nearly 160 co-sponsors in the House. The three authors reportedly began drafting it while they were sheltering-in-place during Wednesday's riot. Dozens of people have been taken into custody as the dust settles from Wednesday's violence at the US Capitol. Here are some of the offenders: Congresswoman Mary Miller had called Hitler 'right' A Republican lawmaker who had been in office for less than a week when she invoked German dictator Adolf Hitler in a Washington speech has apologised for saying that she agreed with the mass murderer. Illinois Congresswoman Mary Miller had said in a speech on Tuesday outside the Capitol, one day before her fellow Trump supporters ransacked the building, that Hitler had been ""right"". Miller told the crowd: ""You know, if we win a few elections weâre still going to be losing unless we win the hearts of our children. ""Itâs the battle. Hitler was right on one thing - that whoever has the youth has the future.""  Hitler, among his supporters in Germany in 1933 The comments drew large-scale condemnation, with the US Holocaust Memorial Museum saying in a statement that it ""unequivocally condemns any leader trying to advance a position by claiming Adolf Hitler was âright.â"" Under Hitler, millions of Jews and other minority groups were murdered across Europe by Germany and its allies during World War Two. On Friday, Miller insisted that she is not anti-semitic and accused other of ""trying to intentionally twist my words"". ""I sincerely apologise for any harm my words caused and regret using a reference to one of the most evil dictators in history to illustrate the dangers that outside influences can have on our youth,"" she said. Correction 23rd
June 2022: This post originally described Mary Miller as having praised Hitler
and has been amended to make clear that she invoked Hitler in her speech. Lindsey Graham, a senior Republican member of the US Senate, is the latest target of harassment by Trump supporters in Washington DC. On Wednesday - after an armed mob invaded the US Capitol building - Graham joined other members of Congress in returning to certify the election results. In a speech before his colleagues, he declared Joe Biden to be ""lawfully elected"" and thus ""the legitimate president"". On Friday, a crowd of angry Trump loyalists confronted him in a DC-area airport, labelling him a ""traitor"". ""You don't represent us anymore,"" shouted one, as Graham - surrounded by security - walked away. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

response to this week's events, the Association of Flight Attendants - a
 labour union that represents nearly 50,000 flight attendants - called 
for a travel blacklist of such passengers for unruly conduct that 
endangers flight safety. Zhaoyin FengBBC Chinese, Washington DC When Washington is mired in division and 
dysfunction, the leadership in Beijing is consolidating power, silencing
 dissent and advancing technologies. China is able to leverage the lack of stability in 
the US to promote two of its arguments. The first one is that democracy 
is messy and potentially violent, which does not make it an ideal political 
model for China. Second, the West is applying a double standard in its behaviour toward China. Foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua 
Chunying drew comparisons between the Washington riots with 
pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong: âSeeing those scenes in the United 
States has brought back a sense of dÃ©jÃ  vu.â She criticised
 western politicians and media for glorifying the Hong Kong protesters 
while condemning those storming into the US Congress. As many have pointed out, despite the superficial 
similarities of the two events, they are fundamentally different. Hong 
Kong activists were demanding a fully democratic election, while the 
Capitol rioters were trying to overturn the result
 of such a vote. But there is little doubt the mayhem in the US
 has reinforced Beijingâs messages and further damaged Washingtonâs 
reputation around the globe. Analysts have labeled the Capitol siege as the day 
when ""the post-American era"" began. Many in and outside of China 
believe the new era will be âthe China centuryâ. If that's so, what would it look like? This is just one among the many
 big questions arising from the extraordinary events in Washington this 
week. Tara McKelveyBBC News, Washington In the wake of Wednesday's assault, dozens of people have been arrested - many for curfew violations - but most of the culprits of the Capitol building break-in remain at large. These intruders could be charged with an array of crimes, ranging from trespassing and other relatively minor ones to serious offences involving firearms and explosive devices. They could be sentenced to many years in prison. Which is why the FBI is now asking: do you recognise anyone in this picture? If so, agents want to hear from you. They want everyone in Washington DC, and across the US, to join their crime-solving team. Read the full story about the FBI's outreach and citizen-sleuthing here. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau began his press conference today by addressing the ""assault on democracy by violent rioters"" that he says was ""incited by the current president and other politicians"". He says that US democracy has shown itself to be ""resilient"" since Wednesday's raid, adding that he has discussed the situation with the premiers of Canada's provinces last night. ""Democracy is not automatic. It takes work every day,"" says the liberal leader who has been forced to bite his tongue on more than a few occasion over the last four years. This video can not be played Justin Trudeau: DC riot was 'assault on democracy' President-elect Biden says there should be a full investigation into the security breakdown at the Capitol. He emphasised that the rioters who broke in were ""thugs"". ""These are a bunch of thugs. They're terrorists, domestic terrorists,"" he said, adding that they should be prosecuted. Biden also said the unfolding of the situation, with the ""active encouragement of a sitting president"", should be investigated. ""The idea that thousands of people could be marching up the steps of the United States Capitol, breaking the windows, breaking doors, forcing their way in... and it looked like you had some of the Capitol police taking selfies with these people. ""That has to be thoroughly investigated, the authorities responsible have to be held accountable for the failures that occurred and we have to make sure that this can never ever happen again."" Biden added: ""This reminded me more of states I've visited...in tin horn dictatorships."" Asked if he believes that law enforcement will be able to secure his inauguration ceremony on 20 January, when he officially takes over the keys to the White House, Biden says he has ""great confidence in the Secret Service"" and the inauguration committee. ""I have confidence in the planning that has been underway before this and continues with the Secret Service,"" he says during his speech from Delaware. When asked how he feels about Trump skipping the inauguration ceremony, Biden calls the decision ""one of the few things he and I agree on,"" adding that is a good thing Trump won't be there. Biden adds that Vice-President Mike Pence - who certified Biden's win on Wednesday after lawmakers retook control of the chamber - is still ""welcome"" to attend. President-elect Joe Biden says he's more focused on addressing the pandemic than impeaching his predecessor. When asked about Democrats in the House of Representatives saying they would introduce articles of impeachment against Donald Trump, Biden said his ""number one concern"" was getting Covid under control. ""I'm focused on the virus, vaccine and economic growth,"" Biden answered, adding that he plans on introducing legislation immediately upon taking office to deal with the virus and the economy. ""What the Congress decides to do is for them to decide,"" he said. ""We're gonna do our job and Congress can decide how to proceed with theirs."" This video can not be played 'President Donald Trump is likely to pardon himself' Prof Bruce Ackerman from Yale law school says he believes President Trump will pardon himself before leaving office. But he told BBC World News it didn't mean he wouldn't face charges. ""The president can only pardon people for their offences against federal law,"" Prof Ackerman said. ""There is every reason to believe, however, that President Trump will be charged with a large number of criminal offences especially under the law of the state of New York,"" he added. President Trump faces numerous investigations,including New York State inquiriesinto whether he misled tax authorities, banks or business partners. He has repeatedly dismissed the investigations, calling them a ""witch hunt"" Â© 2025 BBC.

Thank you for reading. The team was Alex Therrien, Mary O'Connor, Alexandra Fouche, Kevin Ponniah, Max Matza, Owen Amos, and James Clarke. We're pausing our live coverage of the coronavirus pandemic for today. It's been a busy day in the UK - here's a roundup of the day's top headlines: Richmond upon Thames was the one area in England not to see a rise in cases All but one of England's 315 local areas have seen a recent rise in coronavirus case rates, figures released today show. Richmond upon Thames, in south-west London, was the one exception, with a fall in infections. The figures, for the seven days to 4 January, are based on tests carried out in laboratories (pillar one of the government's testing programme) and in the wider community (pillar two). Barking & Dagenham in London continues to have the highest rate in England, with 1,687.1 cases per 100,000 people - up from 1,150.3 in the seven days to 28 December. Redbridge, also in London, has the second highest rate, up from 1,166.4 to 1,559.2. Thurrock in Essex has the third highest rate, up from 1,252.1 to 1,540.1. Richmond upon Thames has 629.7 - down from 639.3. If you're just joining us, here's a roundup of today's international headlines: Throughout the pandemic, the BBC is working hard to answer your questions on everything from vaccines to the latest rules where you live. New lockdowns are now in force in England and most of Scotland, as well as Wales and Northern Ireland. Tina Howson from Leicester asks: My elderly mum is my support bubble but she does not live locally (about a 90-minute drive away). Am I still allowed to go to see her? Find out how the BBC answered Tina's question - and others asked since then -here. A number of sporting fixtures in the UK have been cancelled after players tested positive for coronavirus. Among them are the FA Cup third round clash between Southampton and Shrewsbury and rugby union's Premiership game between Northampton Saints and Leicester Tigers - both of which were due to take place on Saturday. Other sides will field reserve or youth teams after their first team were forced to isolate. You can check the full list of affected fixtures, which the BBC will update,here. Meanwhile,Newcastle boss Steve Bruce has said it is ""morally wrong"" for football to continueamid increasing coronavirus outbreaks at clubs. The Magpies were the first team to have a Premier League match postponed this season, but more than 60 games in England have been called off. ""Financially it's right to play on, but for me, morally, it's probably wrong,"" said Bruce. ""I understand people want to see a game of football but we are just as vulnerable as everybody else."" Prof Chris Whitty will front one of the adverts The government is urging people in England to stay at home and ""act like you've got it"" as part of a new advertising campaign. The ""stay at home, save lives"" campaign will run across TV, radio, out-of-home advertising and social media. The campaign will include a new advert fronted by England's Chief Medical Officer, Prof Chris Whitty, which will air for the first time on ITV at 19:15 GMT tonight. The UK reported arecord number of deaths and casestoday, as hospitals come under growing pressure, with some in the South East at extreme capacity. Around one in three people with Covid-19 donât have any symptoms and can pass it on without realising, the government said, ""which is why itâs essential everyone stays at home and remembers Hands, Face, Space"". Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: ""Our hospitals are under more pressure than at any other time since the start of the pandemic, and infection rates across the entire country continue to soar at an alarming rate. âThe vaccine has given us renewed hope in our fight against the virus but we must not be complacent. ""The NHS is under severe strain and we must take action to protect it, both so our doctors and nurses can continue to save lives and so they can vaccinate as many people as possible as quickly as we can. âI know the last year has taken its toll â but your compliance is now more vital than ever. So once again, I must urge everyone to stay at home, protect the NHS and save lives.â Kevin PeacheyPersonal finance reporter England's eviction ban has been extended for six weeks, following a similar move in Scotland on Thursday. The move will mean eviction notices - which could have started again on Monday - will not be served on tenants during lockdown. It follows calls from charities for more financial support for tenants. Councils are also being given extra funding to house rough sleepers during the cold winter months. They will be asked to go back to people on the streets who had previously refused help, given the rising Covid infection rates. Evictions were banned at the start of the first lockdown in March - and the UK government has also extended the notice period landlords must give from three to six months. Concerns about homelessness and crowded accommodation have risen during the Covid crisis. Half a million private tenants in the UK are behind with their rent, according to research by Citizens Advice. You can read morehere. As we just reported, police and local leaders in Cumbria are urging people not to visit the Lake District this weekend. In Surrey, the council says an advertising van will tour busy areas, warning people to stick to the rules. In recent days the car parks at places including Box Hill, popular with walkers and cyclists, have been overcrowded. ""If youâre heading out for exercise, please stay local to where you live and do not mix in groups,"" says Steve Owen-Hughes,chair of Surreyâs Local Resilience Forum.,external Derwent Isle on Derwentwater Police in Cumbria, in north-west England, have urged residents and visitors to comply with national lockdown restrictions by not visiting the Lake District. In a tweet,external, the force shared a letter - backed by Cumbria's six MPs, several local councillors, NHS and tourism bosses - which urged people not to visit the Lake District National Park and instead ""stay local"" for exercise and essential shopping. It read: ""Whilst it may be tempting to go out for a scenic drive in the Lake District, now is the time to stay home, look after one another and play your part to make sure that Cumbria is ready for the return of visitors when it is safe to do so."" Maddy SavageBBC News, Stockholm Unlike many European leaders, Prime Minister Stefan LÃ¶fven has so far decided against a national lockdown As we reported at 12:01 GMT, Swedenâs parliament has agreed a new pandemic law allowing ministers to introduce stricter measures in the country. Within hours of the law being passed, Prime
Minister Stefan LÃ¶fven announced plans to limit numbers in gyms,
swimming pools and shops in relation to how big they are. Managers will need to
make sure thereâs at least 10 square metres available per person. The Social
Democrat leader also says there will be a ban of more than eight people at
bookable private party venues - from dining halls to common rooms in apartment
blocks. There is already a ban on holding public events for more than eight
people, such as concerts, plays or demonstrations. The law comes into force on
Sunday. Those who break new rules emerging from the legislation will face a
fine - with businesses told they may also be forced to close. Philippa RoxbyHealth reporter, BBC News The number of deaths with Covid-19 reported for the UK today has hita new high of 1,325. Even in the first peak of the pandemic, the daily record was 1,224 (on 21 April). It is a sad and sobering figure â and the grim truth is that the next few weeks are likely to see even more people dying and that figure rising further. That is because cases are continuing to rise, which means hospitals will fill up with more Covid patients, leading to the most seriously ill dying in several weeksâ time. It is an unstoppable trend. Of course, not all those 1,325 deaths happened today. This figure includes deaths that happened mostly over the past few days â but some will have occurred even earlier and a few before Christmas, and will only have been reported today. This lag in recording and reporting deaths over Christmas is why the deaths figures in the past three days have been over 1,000. A more even spread of deaths occurring every day is likely to be seen when we look back at the figures in several weeksâ time. But it doesnât take away from the fact that nearly 80,000 people have now died with Covid-19 in the UK. Alice EvansBBC News Fashion student Mhari Thurston-Tyler posted an advert for the ""crop top"" (right) on Depop after she says she found some discarded Chiltern Railways seat covers (like those on the left) A fashion student is being warned not to sell prohibited items on the clothes app Depop after she posted an advert for a top made from a train seat cover. Mhari Thurston-Tyler made the bandeau out of a Chiltern Railways seat cover designed to promote social distancing during the coronavirus pandemic. The 20-year-old sold the top for Â£15 but later refunded her customer and took the advert down. Depop says the item ""clearly violates our terms of service"". Chiltern Railways says it has been using the social distancing ""seat sashes"" since the beginning of the UK's Covid epidemic.

Organization says there is a ""clear problem"" of poorer countries not receiving supplies of
Covid-19 vaccines. ""Rich countries have the majority of the supply,"" Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus tells reporters in Geneva. He urges countries and manufacturers to
stop making bilateral deals at the expense of the Covax vaccine-sharing scheme. That scheme aims,external""to ensure that people in all corners of the world will get access to vaccines once they are available, regardless of their wealth"". As these graphics show, wealthier countries have made the quickest start on vaccinations - although not all countries are reporting data. Earlier this afternoon, the UK reported 1,325 coronavirus deaths within 28 days of a positive test - the highest daily figure of the pandemic. But Dr William Welfare, director for the Covid-19 response at Public Health England, says the daily death toll is likely to continue to rise. He says: âEach life lost to this virus is a tragedy, but sadly we can expect the death toll to continue to rise until we stop the spread. âApproximately one-in-three people who have coronavirus have no symptoms and could be spreading it without realising it. âTo protect our loved ones it is essential we all stay at home where possible. This will reduce new infections, ease the pressure on the NHS and save lives.â  Some Canadian snowbirds - retired people who travel south for the winter - are finding they are able to get vaccinations in Florida earlier than they could if they remained at home. Florida is allowing anyone over the age of 65 to be vaccinated for no charge. That includes non-citizens. Canada is prioritising health workers and people living in group homes. Getting a vaccine there is like winning the lottery, one coupletell CBC News,external. They say they were able to book vaccinations for other Canadian friends, who are now planning to travel to Florida for the jab after initially postponing their trip due to lack of vaccination.

Major incidents have previously been called for the Grenfell Tower fire in June 2017 and the terror attacks at Westminster Bridge and London Bridge. Mr Khan said: ""Unless the virus reduces... we could run out of beds."" A major incident is defined as being âbeyond the scope of business-as-usual operations, and is likely to involve serious harm, damage, disruption or risk to human life or welfare, essential services, the environment or national securityâ, according tothe mayor's statement.,external Julie Hambleton said she was issued with the penalty notice on 20 December, after the event a month earlier Campaigners attending a memorial to the Birmingham pub bombings have been issued with fixed penalty notices for breaching coronavirus restrictions.

"Marks & Spencer has temporarily stopped selling hundreds of items in its Northern Ireland stores due to Brexit red tape. The retailer said it feared its food would be blocked due to new rules governing shipments between Great Britain and Northern Ireland. A growing number of firms have spoken out about paperwork delays at ports. The government said traders and hauliers need to take steps to comply with new border rules. M&S took the decision to temporarily drop hundreds of products, including chocolate fudge pudding and sweet and sour chicken, from its Northern Ireland stores after it saw competitors' lorries barred from travelling between the mainland and Northern Ireland. An entire consignment in a lorry can be held up if only one item in the truck doesn't have the correct customs forms filled out. The retailer said it aimed to get the products back up for sale soon. An M&S spokesperson said: ""We have served customers in Northern Ireland for over 50 years and our priority is to make sure we continue to deliver the same choice and great quality range that our loyal customers have always enjoyed. ""Stores have been receiving regular deliveries this week, however following the UK's recent departure from the EU, we are transitioning to new processes and we're working closely with our partners and suppliers to ensure customers can continue to enjoy a great range of products."" In addition to problems shipping goods internally in the UK, the new Brexit trade rules are creating problems for exporters and traders transporting goods to and from the EU, say firms. The UK sealed a trade deal with the European Union (EU) on 24 December that was billed as preserving its zero-tariff and zero-quota access to the bloc's single market. But in addition to red tape causing delays, major retailers that use the UK as a distribution hub for European business could face possible tariffs if they re-export goods to the EU. On Friday, M&S chief executive Steve Rowe warned of more red tape and a rise in export costs to some countries. ""The best example I can give you of that is Percy Pig,"" he said, ""Percy Pig is actually manufactured in Germany. If it comes to the UK and we then send it to Ireland, in theory it would have some tax on it,"" he added. M&S said it was ""actively working to mitigate"" the effects of the ""rules of origin"" regulations, under which products are taxed differently depending on which country they come from. Other firms have also been hit by the confusion caused by new Brexit trading rules. Parcels giant DPD has suspended some services, while seafood exporter John Ross said the chaos was like being ""thrown in the cold Atlantic without a lifejacket"". Shane Brennan, chief executive of the Cold Chain Federation, which represents chilled transport and storage companies, said the emerging problems had come despite the amount of cross-border traffic still being quite low. ""Trade flows are still only about 50% of what we would expect, but even at those levels we are seeing levels of confusion and delays,"" he told the BBC's Today programme. ""The feeling is we are building to quite a significant potential disruption."" John Lewis scrapping overseas deliveries Were there hold-ups in first week after Brexit? Why are there empty shelves in some supermarkets? Covid tests for Channel hauliers to continue A government spokesman acknowledged that there had been ""some issues"", but said ministers had always been clear there would be some disruption at the end of the transition period. The Cabinet Office said in a statement that the volume of border crossings had been low so far this year, but that it expected crossings to steadily increase to normal levels. This brings the potential for ""significant disruption if traders and hauliers have not taken the necessary steps to comply with the new rules,"" the Cabinet Office said. Out of about 1,500 lorries per day trying to get from Great Britain to the EU in the new year, 700 have been turned away - mainly due to a lack of a negative Covid test for drivers, it said. ""We have always been clear there would be changes now that we are out of the customs union and single market, so full compliance with the new rules is vital to avoid disruption,"" said Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove. However, anger is growing among companies whose livelihoods depend on export trade. In a letter on Friday to Business Secretary Alok Sharma, Scottish salmon producer John Ross Jr launched a stinging attack on the government's handling of the situation. The firm's sales director, Victoria Leigh-Pearson, wrote that the company had in recent months ""had to endure the government issuing a barrage of useless information"" and an ""absence of factually correct information from all government agencies."" It amounted, she said, to ""gross incompetence"". John Ross exports to 36 countries and has won the Queen's Award twice Part of the letter to Alok Sharma: As I write, perishable goods that were dispatched from our facility five days ago, headed for France following a process that your department advised, have still not crossed the border. This usually takes only 24 hours because they are consolidated with the produce of other companies, which have not been able to follow the correct procedures due to a knowledge gap directly attributable to your department. Entire trucks are currently being rejected without explanation by the French customs authority. Our hauliers have now pulled their services as such a backlog has been created. Other hauliers are not taking on new customers. Today, we've even had confirmation that the IT systems of the UK and France are incompatible. After four years you only establish this now? Your so-called 'deal' is worthless if this situation is not fixed immediately, and unless you put in place measures to address the issues that continue to unfold on a daily basis. Moreover, as a seafood exporter, it feels as though our own government has thrown us into the cold Atlantic waters without a lifejacket. Yours sincerely, Victoria Leigh-Pearson, Sales Director, John Ross John Ross is not the only Scottish seafood exporter suffering. The industry says it has been hit by a ""perfect storm"" of Brexit disruption, which could sink a centuries-old industry. ""These businesses are not transporting toilet rolls or widgets. They are exporting the highest quality, perishable seafood which has a finite window to get to markets in peak condition,"" said Donna Fordyce, chief executive of Seafood Scotland. ""If the window closes, these consignments go to landfill."" She said the sector has already been weakened by Covid-19, the closure of the French border before Christmas as well as ""layer upon layer"" of problems associated with Brexit. The group fears that without exports, the fishing fleet will have little reason to go out. ""In a very short time, we could see the destruction of a centuries-old market which contributes significantly to the Scottish economy,"" added Ms Fordyce. UK government Minister for Scotland David Duguid blamed Scottish leaders for the issues. ""The Scottish Government has persistently refused to accept the democratic vote to leave the EU, but that does not allow them to abdicate their responsibilities to Scottish businesses,"" he said. ""Over the past 18 months they have assured the fishing industry that the systems they were putting in place would be adequate. They clearly are not."" Parcel delivery service DPD UK said it had paused its European Road Service because of the '""increased burden"" of customs paperwork for packages heading to the EU, including the Republic of Ireland. DPD said 20% of parcels had ""incorrect or incomplete data attached"", which meant they would have to be returned. This video can not be played What Brexit means for Britons travelling, shopping, studying or owning properties in the EU. In an email to its business customers, the company said that it had been a ""challenging few days"" for its international operation, and that it would ""pause and review"" its service.  It plans to restart on 13 January. ""It has now become evident that we have an increased burden with the new, more complex processes, and additional customs data we require from you for your parcels destined to Europe"" the firm wrote. The boss of one of Wales' largest hauliers said logistical problems have emerged at the Irish border too. Andrew Kinsella, managing director of Gwynedd Shipping, said his company has a backlog of 60 lorries waiting to be shipped to Dublin. He said many hauliers are finding that their customers are not able to generate the special declarations that are needed to ultimately enable a lorry to get onto a ferry. ""Whilst you don't see queues at ports and terminals the reality is that these queues are developing elsewhere in our depot in Holyhead, in our depot in Deeside and in our depot in Newport in South Wales, and lots of hauliers have depots in the proximity of ports,"" he said. ""There are a lot of issues about demarcation about who is going to arrange the export declaration with the UK revenue authorities, who's going to arrange the import declaration, the hauliers then trying to arrange the import safety and security declaration to create an ENS number which helps you generate a PBN number so there has been a lot of everyone finding their feet"".

"Face masks are no longer legally required in Welsh shops The last Covid restrictions are set to end in Wales on Monday after 26 months. The wearing of face masks will no longer be legally required in health and social care services from Monday 30 May. It will be the first time there will be no Covid restrictions in Wales since the first lockdown in March 2020. The country is currently atalert level zero,external, the lowest tier of Covid rules, with numbers testing positive having fallen in recent weeks. The UK's last remaining Covid restrictions New Zealand to scrap some Covid vaccine mandates The lowest set of restrictions since the start of the pandemic. We were last in alert level zero at Christmas. Under it, most curbs to our daily life have been removed, and all businesses have been allowed to reopen. Self-isolation rules did still apply, but were scrapped from 28 March. It is no longer a legal requirement but people are still strongly recommended to use face coverings in any health setting to protect the most vulnerable. The Welsh government said the NHS continued to experience ""emergency and pandemic pressures"". Since 22 December, those identified as being a close contact of someone who tests positive for Covid-19 in Wales have not had to self-isolate automatically, if they are fully vaccinated, aged between five and 18, or participating in a vaccine clinical trial. Instead, the Welsh government strongly advises them to take lateral flow tests for seven days as a precautionary measure. Children under five do not need to isolate and are not required to take a PCR test or do lateral flow tests. Since 28 January, people who have tested positive must isolate for a minimum of five full days, with two negative lateral flow tests required on days five and six. Until then, the self-isolation period was seven days,down from the 10 days it was previously, with negative lateral flow tests needed on days six and seven. The Welsh government put the measures in place on 26 December to protect customers and staff in businesses The Welsh government has urged people to take lateral flow tests before socialising, shopping or visiting people and not to go out if it is positive. It advised meeting outdoors where possible and to make sure indoor meetings are well ventilated. People, it said, should leave at least a day between social events. From 26 December, groups of no more than six people were allowed to meet in pubs, cinemas and restaurants in Wales, with licensed premises having to offer table service only, and face masks worn, along with contact tracing details collected. But under the Welsh government announcement, all of this changed on 28 January. The rule of six was scrapped, meaning people can go to the pub with whoever they like, can go to the bar for a drink, and social distancing has ended. People are also able to be served at bars again, as table service only rules were scrapped. While wearing a face mask in a pub or bar is no longer required by law, the Welsh government has advised staff and customers to wear them indoors, when not eating, drinking or dancing. Limits on indoor or outdoor event numbers were lifted on 7 August and remain the same Limits on indoor or outdoor event numbers were lifted on 7 August. For important life events such as weddings, civil partnerships, funerals and wakes, the numbers will be determined by the ability of the venue to manage social distancing and other reasonable measures. All guests will need to take a lateral flow test. People attending weddings, civil partnerships or alternative wedding ceremonies or receptions, no longer have to wear face coverings by law under alert level zero. The Welsh government advised people to wear face coverings indoors when not eating, drinking or dancing. You can, and international travel is allowed, although local rules and quarantine will apply. On 25 January 2022, theWelsh government stopped advising people against travelling abroad for holidaysfor the first time since the start of the pandemic. Nightclubs were closed from 26 December, but under the four-stage plan, they have been allowed to open since 28 January, when Wales moved to alert level zero. Covid passes were scrapped on 18 February for nightclubs, along with cinemas, theatres and other large events. As cases continued to remain low, sports fans were allowed to return to events From 15 January the number of people allowed to attend an outdoor event rose from 50 to 500. On 21 January all outdoor activities moved to alert level zero, with no limits on the number of people who can take part and crowds were able to return to sporting events. Gyms, swimming pools, leisure centres, community centres and fitness facilities are open Pupils returned later than planned for the start of the new spring term in January. From 18 February, they were no longer required to wear face coverings and schools could decide their own rules. Working from home is no longer law in Wales A legal restriction to work from home unless unavoidable, with Â£60 fines for anyone who did not comply and had no reasonable excuse, was scrapped on 28 January. You have been able to travel anywhere in the UK since 12 April 2021, subject to restrictions in force in the other nations. It also means people from other parts of the UK can come here. All holiday accommodation was able to fully reopen from 17 May.

"First Minister Mark Drakeford has been giving an update on the pandemic in Wales The lockdown will be strengthened and remains in place for at least another three weeks, he says Schools and colleges will stay closed to most pupils until February half term unless there is a ""significant"" fall in Covid cases Mr Drakeford has defended the slower roll-out of Covid vaccines in Wales, saying it was ""not a sprint"" and claiming the difference with other UK nations was ""marginal"" Zara Morgan and Andy Roberts That's all from our live coverage of the first minister's coronavirus update. Here's a reminder of the main points from Friday:  Thanks for joining us - have a good weekend. Large stones were laid in front of a car park in Llanuwchllyn today Car parks in Snowdonia are to close followinga rise in lockdown rulebreakers, national park bosses have said. Authority chairman Wyn Ellis Jones said a ""high volume of people"" had been seen ignoring Covid rules in the area since Christmas. It follows reports ofabuse towards staff at a Snowdonia car park amid crowds gathering last weekend. The park authority said there had been an increase ""in examples of people disregarding current Welsh Government guidelines"".  The first minister has said he wants supermarkets to have ""visible"" Covid-19 protections, in the wake of people ""expressing anxiety"" over their absence. Mark Drakeford said he was
getting a lot of inquiries about how visible protections in supermarkets earlier in the
pandemic ""don't appear to be there this time, despite... a more aggressive strain of the virus"". He said: ""Those protections are
needed even more, so what we are talking to the supermarkets about is a more
visible set of measures. The first minister said that in March, April and
May last year ""if you went to a supermarket there was always somebody at
the front door"" who was controlling shop numbers. ""Some of that is no longer as apparent to people as it was in the early
days of the pandemic,"" he said. BBC Radio Wales Mother-of-four Kaarina Rutta is juggling work with home schooling Parents and teachers are ""frustrated"" about plans to keep schools closed until the February half term and concerned about the impact on children. Speaking to the BBC Radio Wales phone-in,callers said they felt young people were being ""thrown under the bus"". Others said they were fed up with ""bitty information"" from the Welsh Government. Kaarina Rutta from Sully, Vale of Glamorgan, told the programme she was having to work at night when her four children had gone to bed after home schooling. ""It's a challenge trying to help all four at the same time and also having in the back of your mind I should also be working and doing other things,"" she said. ""I was quite sure that this was going to happen,"" she added. ""It didn't come as a surprise I have to say, because the situation is just so bad I think there is no other way out of it at the moment. ""I just wish we had known earlier on and it would have been easier to plan."" First Minister Mark Drakeford said it was the ""best certainty"" he could offer ""in a world which is highly uncertain"". The share of the Welsh population infected with Covid-19 has fallen, according to the Office for National Statistics. Its latest infection survey shows the proportion has fallen from 1 in 50 people on 23 December to around 1 in 70 on 2 January, a fall from an estimated 58,000 people to 44,100. England's infection rate has now risen to 1 in 50 and Scotland's has increased to 1 in 115 in the most recent week, with Northern Ireland having stopped falling at 1 in 200. Plaid Cymru's health spokesman Rhun ap Iorwerth has called for vaccination targets to be set in Wales ""to measure performance"". The Ynys Mon member of the Senedd (MS) said that people need confidence ""so they can not get too frustrated and worrying that things are happening tardily"". âPeople are being told, 'wait at home, your turn will come',"" he told BBC Wales. âWe need to know exactly how many vaccines we have, how many are being distributed to each health board so we know that itâs equitable throughout Wales, and how many are being stuck in peopleâs arms, so we know how many are being administered, and to each of the priority groups.""  The leader of the Welsh Conservatives has criticised the Welsh Government for falling behind other UK nations on vaccinating people. Paul Davies told BBC Wales he was âvery surprised"" the Welsh Government had not published ""a detailed and comprehensive plan regarding vaccination"". âWe need to know when these vaccines are coming through, how
they are coming through, who is going to receive them,"" he said. ""People need to know
answers to these questions because at the end of the day people need confidence
that the Welsh Government are doing the right thing when it comes to
vaccination.â First Minister Mark Drakeford hasinsisted the difference in vaccination rates is ""marginal"". Wales' First Minister Mark Drakeford has said he âshares the ambitionâ set out by Boris Johnson of vaccinating the top priority groups by mid-February. The UK government has seta target to offer vaccination slots to 15 million in the top four priority groups by 15 February. However Mr Drakeford warned that both administrations were dependent on supply of the vaccine to meet any target. He said the number of vaccination centres was rising to 35 in Wales, with 100 GP practices vaccinating by next Friday and 250 by the end of the month. Mr Drakeford said having received 22,000 doses of the Oxford vaccine for Wales this week, there would 25,000 doses next week and 80,000 the following week. He was unable to give a figure of the number of Pfizer vaccines available, other than to say there had been âsignificantâ deliveries in December, and the current numbers were higher than the Oxford vaccine. Setting a target on vaccination delivery numbers without knowing how much supply there is beyond a fortnight ""simply does not make sense"", according to the first minister. Mark Drakeford said: ""We do not have infinite supply, and we don't even know how much supply we will have three weeks from today. ""That simply would not be a sensible basis on which to plan for the sort of future that we want to have for vaccination in Wales."" The first minister added he was ""very keen"" to publish Wales' plan on vaccination next week, which will explain how the system will operate. First Minister Mark Drakeford has said that
""at the moment"" he did not expect to announce further rules for Wales beyond those announced today. Schools will not re-open before February half term unless there is a ""significant"" fall in Covid rates, and the rules for shops now require showrooms to close. Mr Drakeford said the measures taken so far ""appear to be succeeding"". However he said ""if that position were to
reverse"" then the Welsh Government would look at strengthening rules. He added that the Welsh Government had not ""exhausted the repertoire"" of possible further measures. Discussions are continuing with teachers and education officials over ways children can catch up having missed out on time in school, First Minister Mark Drakeford has said. He did not comment on suggestions children could be taught during the summer holidays, but said he would be looking at âthe wider pictureâ. A total of Â£29m had already been allocated to schemes to help pupils catch up, Mr Drakeford said. He added: âI will want to talk to others about how we can, in the rest of 2021, look at further ways of how we can make good the lack of face to face education which our young people have experienced, and which we are having to face again in the circumstances that are currently pertaining across Wales.â Wales' first minister has advised people
receiving the Covid-19 vaccine to ""continue to act in a precautionary
way"". Mark Drakeford said those
people should ""recognise the new protection that they have"" but
""recognise as well that for many weeks, and for some months ahead,
coronavirus is going to continue to be a feature of all our lives"". ""Given that we are
vaccinating the most vulnerable people, and those people who come into contact
with others with coronavirus to the greatest extent, then a precautionary
approach would still be recommended,"" he said. The process of vaccinating the population against Covid-19 is âneither a sprint nor a contestâ, the first minister has said. It comes as figures showWales is lagging behind other parts of the UK with a lower proportion of the population having had the first dose. Speaking to reporters at today's Covid briefing, Mark Drakeford insisted the difference with other UK nations was ""marginal"". He added: âWe will roll out vaccination here in Wales as quickly as we are able in order to make sure that over the weeks ahead the maximum number of people in those priority groups are vaccinated here in Wales."" The announcement to further delay the full re-opening of schools in Wales was left until today because ""circumstances change so rapidly"", the first minister has said. Schools will not fully re-open until 29 January at the earliest,and not before the February half-term breakunless there is a ""significant"" fall in Covid cases. Mark Drakeford said UK chief medical officers raised the alert level from four to five on Monday. ""We have further evidence this week of the continuing spread of a new strain of coronavirus in Wales,"" he said. ""It is all that extra development that has led us today to decide to bring the decision-making on schools and colleges into line with our three-week decision-making cycle [on reviewing all Covid restrictions]. ""It offers the best certainty we can provide in these very uncertain times, and it allows our college and school leaders to plan for the weeks ahead.""  Paramedics in Wales will all get their first dose of Covid vaccine by next week, according to the first minister. The Welsh Government has faced
criticism after it emergedWales has vaccinated a smaller proportion of thepopulationso far than the other UK nations. Mark Drakeford said: âAll front-line ambulance staff in
Wales will have had their first dose by next week and we will be extending
vaccination to staff working in special schools and to school and college staff
who are at risk."" He added that Wales' vaccination roll-out will ""carry on getting faster in the weeks ahead"". Wales is currently under alert level 4 of Covid restrictions Police and councils in Wales will continue to crack down on those who
break lockdown rules, First Minister Mark Drakeford has said. He confirmed the current restrictions will remain in place
for at least another three weeks, including the closure of schools to most pupils. Hundreds of fines for breaches of the rules had already been levied, Mr Drakeford said, adding that âthis stepped-up enforcement will continueâ. âItâs always frustrating when a
small minority act as though those rules do not apply to them,"" he said. âToo many lives have been lost to
this awful virus to allow anybody to believe that they do not share in the
responsibility that binds us all.â All international passengers will soon have totest negative for Covid-19 before travelling to the UK. People arriving by plane, train or boat, including UK nationals, will have to take a test up to 72 hours before leaving the country they are in. However, even with a negative test, arrivals from countries not on the travel corridor list must still quarantine. Wales is inalert level 4, meaning non-essential travel is banned. The new strain of coronavirus has taken a ""firm foothold"" in north Wales, according to the First Minister Mark Drakeford. Giving today's Welsh Government update on the pandemic, he said cases of the virus in the region were ""rising rapidly"". ""We expect the new strain will become the dominant form of the virus in south Wales as well,"" he said. A third Covid vaccine has been approved for use in the UK. It is made by the company Modernaand works in a similar way to the Pfizer one that is already being offered on the NHS. Supplies of the new jab are not expected to be available until the Spring however. The UK has pre-ordered 7 million doses.

Thank you for reading. The team was Alex Therrien, Mary O'Connor, Alexandra Fouche, Kevin Ponniah, Max Matza, Owen Amos, and James Clarke. We're pausing our live coverage of the coronavirus pandemic for today. It's been a busy day in the UK - here's a roundup of the day's top headlines: Richmond upon Thames was the one area in England not to see a rise in cases All but one of England's 315 local areas have seen a recent rise in coronavirus case rates, figures released today show. Richmond upon Thames, in south-west London, was the one exception, with a fall in infections. The figures, for the seven days to 4 January, are based on tests carried out in laboratories (pillar one of the government's testing programme) and in the wider community (pillar two). Barking & Dagenham in London continues to have the highest rate in England, with 1,687.1 cases per 100,000 people - up from 1,150.3 in the seven days to 28 December. Redbridge, also in London, has the second highest rate, up from 1,166.4 to 1,559.2. Thurrock in Essex has the third highest rate, up from 1,252.1 to 1,540.1. Richmond upon Thames has 629.7 - down from 639.3. If you're just joining us, here's a roundup of today's international headlines: Throughout the pandemic, the BBC is working hard to answer your questions on everything from vaccines to the latest rules where you live. New lockdowns are now in force in England and most of Scotland, as well as Wales and Northern Ireland. Tina Howson from Leicester asks: My elderly mum is my support bubble but she does not live locally (about a 90-minute drive away). Am I still allowed to go to see her? Find out how the BBC answered Tina's question - and others asked since then -here. A number of sporting fixtures in the UK have been cancelled after players tested positive for coronavirus. Among them are the FA Cup third round clash between Southampton and Shrewsbury and rugby union's Premiership game between Northampton Saints and Leicester Tigers - both of which were due to take place on Saturday. Other sides will field reserve or youth teams after their first team were forced to isolate. You can check the full list of affected fixtures, which the BBC will update,here. Meanwhile,Newcastle boss Steve Bruce has said it is ""morally wrong"" for football to continueamid increasing coronavirus outbreaks at clubs. The Magpies were the first team to have a Premier League match postponed this season, but more than 60 games in England have been called off. ""Financially it's right to play on, but for me, morally, it's probably wrong,"" said Bruce. ""I understand people want to see a game of football but we are just as vulnerable as everybody else."" Prof Chris Whitty will front one of the adverts The government is urging people in England to stay at home and ""act like you've got it"" as part of a new advertising campaign. The ""stay at home, save lives"" campaign will run across TV, radio, out-of-home advertising and social media. The campaign will include a new advert fronted by England's Chief Medical Officer, Prof Chris Whitty, which will air for the first time on ITV at 19:15 GMT tonight. The UK reported arecord number of deaths and casestoday, as hospitals come under growing pressure, with some in the South East at extreme capacity. Around one in three people with Covid-19 donât have any symptoms and can pass it on without realising, the government said, ""which is why itâs essential everyone stays at home and remembers Hands, Face, Space"". Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: ""Our hospitals are under more pressure than at any other time since the start of the pandemic, and infection rates across the entire country continue to soar at an alarming rate. âThe vaccine has given us renewed hope in our fight against the virus but we must not be complacent. ""The NHS is under severe strain and we must take action to protect it, both so our doctors and nurses can continue to save lives and so they can vaccinate as many people as possible as quickly as we can. âI know the last year has taken its toll â but your compliance is now more vital than ever. So once again, I must urge everyone to stay at home, protect the NHS and save lives.â Kevin PeacheyPersonal finance reporter England's eviction ban has been extended for six weeks, following a similar move in Scotland on Thursday. The move will mean eviction notices - which could have started again on Monday - will not be served on tenants during lockdown. It follows calls from charities for more financial support for tenants. Councils are also being given extra funding to house rough sleepers during the cold winter months. They will be asked to go back to people on the streets who had previously refused help, given the rising Covid infection rates. Evictions were banned at the start of the first lockdown in March - and the UK government has also extended the notice period landlords must give from three to six months. Concerns about homelessness and crowded accommodation have risen during the Covid crisis. Half a million private tenants in the UK are behind with their rent, according to research by Citizens Advice. You can read morehere. As we just reported, police and local leaders in Cumbria are urging people not to visit the Lake District this weekend. In Surrey, the council says an advertising van will tour busy areas, warning people to stick to the rules. In recent days the car parks at places including Box Hill, popular with walkers and cyclists, have been overcrowded. ""If youâre heading out for exercise, please stay local to where you live and do not mix in groups,"" says Steve Owen-Hughes,chair of Surreyâs Local Resilience Forum.,external Derwent Isle on Derwentwater Police in Cumbria, in north-west England, have urged residents and visitors to comply with national lockdown restrictions by not visiting the Lake District. In a tweet,external, the force shared a letter - backed by Cumbria's six MPs, several local councillors, NHS and tourism bosses - which urged people not to visit the Lake District National Park and instead ""stay local"" for exercise and essential shopping. It read: ""Whilst it may be tempting to go out for a scenic drive in the Lake District, now is the time to stay home, look after one another and play your part to make sure that Cumbria is ready for the return of visitors when it is safe to do so."" Maddy SavageBBC News, Stockholm Unlike many European leaders, Prime Minister Stefan LÃ¶fven has so far decided against a national lockdown As we reported at 12:01 GMT, Swedenâs parliament has agreed a new pandemic law allowing ministers to introduce stricter measures in the country. Within hours of the law being passed, Prime
Minister Stefan LÃ¶fven announced plans to limit numbers in gyms,
swimming pools and shops in relation to how big they are. Managers will need to
make sure thereâs at least 10 square metres available per person. The Social
Democrat leader also says there will be a ban of more than eight people at
bookable private party venues - from dining halls to common rooms in apartment
blocks. There is already a ban on holding public events for more than eight
people, such as concerts, plays or demonstrations. The law comes into force on
Sunday. Those who break new rules emerging from the legislation will face a
fine - with businesses told they may also be forced to close. Philippa RoxbyHealth reporter, BBC News The number of deaths with Covid-19 reported for the UK today has hita new high of 1,325. Even in the first peak of the pandemic, the daily record was 1,224 (on 21 April). It is a sad and sobering figure â and the grim truth is that the next few weeks are likely to see even more people dying and that figure rising further. That is because cases are continuing to rise, which means hospitals will fill up with more Covid patients, leading to the most seriously ill dying in several weeksâ time. It is an unstoppable trend. Of course, not all those 1,325 deaths happened today. This figure includes deaths that happened mostly over the past few days â but some will have occurred even earlier and a few before Christmas, and will only have been reported today. This lag in recording and reporting deaths over Christmas is why the deaths figures in the past three days have been over 1,000. A more even spread of deaths occurring every day is likely to be seen when we look back at the figures in several weeksâ time. But it doesnât take away from the fact that nearly 80,000 people have now died with Covid-19 in the UK. Alice EvansBBC News Fashion student Mhari Thurston-Tyler posted an advert for the ""crop top"" (right) on Depop after she says she found some discarded Chiltern Railways seat covers (like those on the left) A fashion student is being warned not to sell prohibited items on the clothes app Depop after she posted an advert for a top made from a train seat cover. Mhari Thurston-Tyler made the bandeau out of a Chiltern Railways seat cover designed to promote social distancing during the coronavirus pandemic. The 20-year-old sold the top for Â£15 but later refunded her customer and took the advert down. Depop says the item ""clearly violates our terms of service"". Chiltern Railways says it has been using the social distancing ""seat sashes"" since the beginning of the UK's Covid epidemic. A spokeswoman adds: ""Whilst we appreciate this new take on railway memorabilia, these items are there to help customers travel with confidence and we would respectfully ask that they are left in place."" Read more here. The head of the World Health
Organization says there is a ""clear problem"" of poorer countries not receiving supplies of
Covid-19 vaccines. ""Rich countries have the majority of the supply,"" Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus tells reporters in Geneva. He urges countries and manufacturers to
stop making bilateral deals at the expense of the Covax vaccine-sharing scheme. That scheme aims,external""to ensure that people in all corners of the world will get access to vaccines once they are available, regardless of their wealth"". As these graphics show, wealthier countries have made the quickest start on vaccinations - although not all countries are reporting data. Earlier this afternoon, the UK reported 1,325 coronavirus deaths within 28 days of a positive test - the highest daily figure of the pandemic. But Dr William Welfare, director for the Covid-19 response at Public Health England, says the daily death toll is likely to continue to rise. He says: âEach life lost to this virus is a tragedy, but sadly we can expect the death toll to continue to rise until we stop the spread. âApproximately one-in-three people who have coronavirus have no symptoms and could be spreading it without realising it. âTo protect our loved ones it is essential we all stay at home where possible. This will reduce new infections, ease the pressure on the NHS and save lives.â  Some Canadian snowbirds - retired people who travel south for the winter - are finding they are able to get vaccinations in Florida earlier than they could if they remained at home. Florida is allowing anyone over the age of 65 to be vaccinated for no charge. That includes non-citizens. Canada is prioritising health workers and people living in group homes. Getting a vaccine there is like winning the lottery, one coupletell CBC News,external. They say they were able to book vaccinations for other Canadian friends, who are now planning to travel to Florida for the jab after initially postponing their trip due to lack of vaccination. As we reported earlier this hour, the UK today reported a record number of coronavirus deaths and cases - 1,325 and 68,053 respectively. In the below graphics we explore the trends behind the numbers. This video can not be played As we've been reporting, London Mayor Sadiq Khan has declared a ""major incident"" as coronavirus threatens to overwhelm the capital's hospitals. Major incidents have previously been called for the Grenfell Tower fire in June 2017 and the terror attacks at Westminster Bridge and London Bridge.

"High temperatures persisted across the year New data from EU satellites shows that 2020 is in a statistical dead heat with 2016 as the world's warmest year. TheCopernicus Climate Change Service,externalsays that last year was around 1.25C above the long-term average. The scientists say that unprecedented levels of heat in the Arctic and Siberia were key factors in driving up the overall temperature. The past 12 months also saw a new record for Europe, around 0.4C warmer than 2019. Alaskan wilderness opens up for oil exploration Five reasons to feel hopeful about climate change Green body gives verdict on UK's climate policies Last December, the World Meteorological Organizationpredicted that 2020 would be one of the three warmest years on record. This new, more complete report from Copernicus says that last year is right at the top of the list. High temperatures saw fires rage in spring and summer in many locations inside the Arctic circle The Copernicus data comes from a constellation of Sentinel satellites that monitor the Earth from orbit, as well as measurements taken at ground level. Temperature data from the system,externalshows that 2020 was 1.25C warmer than the average from 1850-1900, a time often described as the ""pre-industrial"" period. One key factor driving up the temperatures was the heating experienced in the Arctic andSiberia. In some locations there,temperatures for the yearas a whole were 6C above the long-term average. This video can not be played 2020 joint warmest year on record This exceptional warming led to a very active wildfire season. Fires in the Arctic Circle released a record amount of CO2, according to the study, up over a third from 2019. The Copernicus service concludes that while 2020 was very marginally cooler than 2016, the two years are statistically on a par as the differences between the figures for the two years are smaller than the typical differences found in other temperature databases for the same period. More data on 2020's temperature will be released in the next week or so from other agencies, including Nasa and the UK Met Office. The scientists say that the closeness between the years is all the more remarkable considering the impacts of the El NiÃ±o/La NiÃ±a weather cycle. People saw their homes burnt down in some parts of Siberia Twenty-sixteen wasmade warmer by a strong El NiÃ±o eventwhile 2020 wasmade slightly cooler by an emerging La NiÃ±ain the second half of the year. Europe also saw a new record level of warming for the year, 0.4C warmer than 2019. A major heat wave in July and August was an important factor driving up the mercury across the continent. Globally, the 10-year period from 2011-2020 is the warmest decade, with the last six years being the six hottest on record. ""Twenty-twenty stands out for its exceptional warmth in the Arctic and a record number of tropical storms in the North Atlantic,"" said Carlo Buontempo, director of the Copernicus Climate Change Service. ""It is no surprise that the last decade was the warmest on record, and is yet another reminder of the urgency of ambitious emissions reductions to prevent adverse climate impacts in the future."" While a strong La NiÃ±a may cool temperatures a little in 2021, levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere are likely to remain high, contributing to ongoing warming. New data from the UK's Met Office suggests that average concentrations of CO2 will reach levels that are 50% higher than they were before the industrial revolution. Researchers predict that annual average CO2 concentration at the Mauna Loa recording station in Hawaii will be around 2.29 parts per million (ppm) higher in 2021 than in 2020. Despite the global slowdowns caused by the Covid-19 pandemic, the scientists say this rise is being driven by emissions from the use of fossil fuels and from deforestation. Europe saw a prolonged heat wave in July and August that pushed the year to a new record While weather patterns linked to the La NiÃ±a event may boost growth in tropical forests and increase the amount of the gas that's absorbed, it won't be enough to slow the overall rise. The Met Office says that CO2 will exceed 417ppm in the atmosphere for several weeks from April to June. This is 50% higher than the level of 278ppm that pertained in the late 18th Century as widespread industrial activity was just beginning. ""The human-caused build-up of CO2 in the atmosphere is accelerating,"" said Prof Richard Betts from the Met Office. ""It took over 200 years for levels to increase by 25%, but now just over 30 years later we are approaching a 50% increase."" ""Reversing this trend and slowing the atmospheric CO2 rise will need global emissions to reduce, and bringing them to a halt will need global emissions to be brought down to net zero. This needs to happen within about the next 30 years if global warming is to be limited to 1.5C."" Follow Matt on Twitter@mattmcgrathbbc,external.

"Covid infections rose by almost a third between 26 December and 3 January, reaching 70,000 new cases a dayaccording to a major study,external. In a different piece of research, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) estimated 1.2 million people in total had Covid over a similar time period. Daily infections are understood to have risen to about 150,000 since then. That would bring daily coronavirus cases above the first peak. The R or reproduction number for the virus is nowbetween 1 and 1.4 for the UK,external, reflecting the sharp rise in cases in recent weeks. SeparateONS data,externalsuggests just under half (44%) of British adults formed a Christmas bubble. These temporary rules let up to three households mix indoors on 25 December -unless they were living in a Tier 4 area. The ONS estimated how much of the population had Covid in the week of 27 December- 2 January: One in 50 in England (upfrom one in 70) One in 70 in Wales (downfrom one in 50) One in 200 in Northern Ireland (upfrom one in 230) One in 115 in Scotland (upfrom one in 145) The ONS data suggests cases rose by three-quarters between its two most recent study periods: 12-18 December and 27 December - 2 January. The ZOE Covid Symptom Study was able to track more recent changes since there was no pause in its research for Christmas. It found the epidemic is growing throughout the UK. Researchers estimate the virus's reproduction or R number is currently 1.2 across the UK. Both sources indicate London has the most severe epidemic with the highest number of cases. Confirmed cases, published on the government's dashboard, are always lower than those in surveys because they mainly reflect the test results of people coming in with symptoms. Both the ONS and ZOE also look at asymptomatic cases - people who may not otherwise get tests. Some asymptomatic testing is now available in the community but it is not being widely taken up. About a fifth of people responding to a separate ONS survey looking at the social impacts of the pandemic, said they had found it difficult to follow the Christmas rules. And half of those gave the fact that they had already made plans as the reason. Rules, which were set to allow everyone in the UK to mix in a five-day window, were changed at the last minute, on 19 December. In England, people living in Tiers 1-3 were allowed to form a one-day Christmas bubble with a maximum of two other households. Those in Tier 4, including about 10 million people in Greater London, were not permitted to mix at all. Mixing was permitted in Scotland and Wales for Christmas Day only.

"Donald Trump became the first US president to be impeached twice Former US President Donald Trump is being put on trial by lawmakers for allegedly inciting a riot at the US Capitol. Last month Mr Trump became the first president in US history to be charged with misconduct - or impeached - twice by the lower chamber of Congress. Republicans and Democrats in the House of Representatives voted to pass an article of impeachment that accused Mr Trump of ""incitement of insurrection"". The article alleged that Mr Trump had made false allegations of election fraud and encouraged his supporters to storm Congress on 6 January. Now a trial is being held in the upper chamber of Congress, the Senate, which will decide whether to convict or clear Mr Trump of the charge. This is an unprecedented moment for the US, which has never put an impeached president on trial after they have left office. So, what can we expect? The trial in the Senate is political, rather than criminal. A vote will be held at the end of the trial to determine whether Mr Trump is guilty of the charge. A two-thirds majority of the 100-member Senate must back a guilty verdict to convict Mr Trump. If Mr Trump is convicted, senators could also vote to bar him from ever holding public office again. This video can not be played House delivers impeachment charge against Donald Trump to the Senate The trial opened on Tuesday with a four-hour debate on whether the proceedings were unconstitutional because Mr Trump is no longer president. A 56-44 majority then voted in favour of continuing, with six Republicans backing the measure. Each side will then be given 16 hours in total to make their arguments, and this will be limited to eight hours in any one day. There will be an option to request a debate and a vote on whether witnesses should be called. Both Democrats and Republicans are said to favour a speedy trial, amid an ongoing effort to get President Joe Biden's Covid-19 relief plan approved. It is thought a vote on a conviction could come as early as Monday if no witnesses are called. Democrats prosecuting the case opened the proceedings by showing a dramatic video montage of Mr Trump's 6 January speech and the deadly rioting by some of his supporters. ""That's a high crime and misdemeanour,"" Representative Jamie Raskin of Maryland - who is leading the case - said of the footage. ""If that's not an impeachable offence, then there's no such thing."" They say Mr Trump is ""personally responsible"" for the riot and must be convicted. This video can not be played Jamie Raskin: 'They thought they were going to die' According toa pre-trial legal brief, they will say his repeated refusal to concede the election led to an ""incitement of insurrection against the republic he swore to protect"". Mr Trump's ""statements turned his 'wild' rally on 6 January into a powder keg waiting to blow"", they will argue. Although he is no longer in office, Mr Trump ""must answer comprehensively for his conduct in office from his first day in office through his last"", Democrats argue. They have called for Mr Trump to be disqualified from ever running for office again. On the opening day, his defence lawyers argued unsuccessfully that it was unconstitutional to put a private citizen through the impeachment process. Defence lawyer David Schoen said the Democrats were using ""the guise of impeachment as a tool to disenfranchise"" those who support Donald Trump. His lawyers are now likely to change tack and argue that Mr Trump's supporters stormed Congress of their own accord. This video can not be played Trump's lawyer, David Schoen: 'Overriding emotion is to cry for the US Constitution' According to their own pre-trial brief, they will argue that Mr Trump's pre-riot remarks did not amount to incitement. The former president's call to ""fight"" was not meant to be taken literally, they say. ""To characterise this statement alone as 'incitement to insurrection' is to ignore, wholesale, the remainder of Mr Trump's speech that day, including his call for his supporters to 'peacefully' making their 'voices heard,'"" they add. Moreover, FBI documents had shown that the riot was planned days in advance, the lawyers said. It is never happened before, so it is untested and the US Constitution does not say. Impeachment proceedings against President Richard Nixon were ended when he quit in 1974. So Mr Trump could take his case to the Supreme Court, claiming his trial was unconstitutional. Some lower ranked officials have been impeached after leaving office. What happens to impeached presidents? What impeachment means for Trump, Biden and America That is certainly what prosecutors wanted. Last week, they sent a letter inviting him to testify under oath ""at a mutually convenient time and place"". The prosecution team suggested that they would cite Mr Trump's silence as further proof that their allegations were true. Within hours, however, the former president's lawyers had rejected the request as a publicity stunt. They made clear he would not testify voluntarily. The prosecutors do have the power to issue a subpoena - or an order to compel him to appear in court to testify - but that is considered unlikely. Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts presided over the first impeachment trial of Mr Trump, but will not do so again. Democratic Senator Patrick Leahy - third in the line of presidential succession - is presiding over the trial instead. Prosecuting the case are nine House Democrats, known as the impeachment managers. Mr Trump is being represented by two attorneys - Bruce Castor and David Schoen. All 100 US senators have been sworn in as jurors in the trial. Democrats only hold half the 100 seats so they would require 17 Republicans to vote against someone from their own party. That is a high bar for a party that has largely remained publicly loyal to Mr Trump. Ten Republicans in the House supported impeachment and a handful of senators have indicated they are open to it. But Tuesday's vote implied loyalty toward the former president in his party remained high enough to avoid a conviction. At the Capitol: Trump's Christian supporters 'Like a medieval battle': The riots frontline If he is convicted by the Senate, lawmakers must hold another vote to block him from running for elected office again - which he had indicated he planned to do in 2024. This could be the biggest consequence of this impeachment. If he is convicted, a simple majority of senators would be needed to block Mr Trump from holding ""any office of honour, trust or profit under the United States"". So 50 senators plus a casting vote from Vice-President Kamala Harris would be enough to damn Mr Trump's hopes of political power. This could be appealing to Republicans hoping to run for president in the future and those who want Mr Trump out of the party. There has been talk of Mr Trump losing benefits granted to his predecessors under the 1958 Former Presidents Act, which include a pension and health insurance, and potentially a lifetime security detail at taxpayers' expense. However, Mr Trump is likely to keep these benefits if he is convicted after leaving office. That was over his dealings with Ukraine, although he denied any wrongdoing. He was accused of pressing the country's leader to open an investigation into Mr Biden, then his emerging rival for the White House, and his son Hunter. Mr Trump appeared to use military aid as leverage. He was impeached by the House and cleared by the then Republican-controlled Senate. Hang on, why was Trump impeached again?

"This video can not be played Education minister Kirsty Williams says online learning must continue for now Schools and colleges in Wales will stay closed to most pupils until the February half term unless there is a ""significant"" fall in Covid cases. First Minister Mark Drakeford also confirmedcurrent lockdown restrictionswould be extended and ""strengthened"". This means non-essential retail, hospitality venues, licensed premises and leisure facilities remain closed and showrooms must now shut as well. Mr Drakeford said: ""The pandemic has reached a significant point."" He told BBC Radio Wales the announcement was the ""best certainty"" he could offer parents, pupils and teachers, ""in a world which is highly uncertain and where things change almost every single day"". The phased return to face-to-face learning at some Welsh universities has also been postponed, while internal GCSE, A-level and AS-level assessments have been cancelled. The announcement follows a similar move in England, where Prime Minister Boris Johnson has already saidschools would not open before half term. Spring half term in Wales is scheduled to take place the week beginning Monday 15 February. Wales has been in analert level four lockdown since 20 Decemberin an attempt to reduce the transmission of coronavirus. On Thursday,63 further deaths from coronaviruswere reported by Public Health Wales. What are Wales' lockdown rules? What is the latest Covid advice for children? School closures 'throwing children under the bus' Speaking to BBC Radio Wales, Mr Drakeford said the new variant was more easily spread and stricter lockdown measures were now needed to keep people safe. Ministers are in talks with employers and unions and changes are set to be announced for workplaces - to protect workers - early next week. Mr Drakeford said he wanted to see the way supermarkets were policed return to the way they were during the first lockdown,with strict number limits in stores and social distancing measures abided to. But he said a curfew, meaning people would have to be in their homes by a certain time,similar to that seen in Northern Ireland, was not currently being considered. This video can not be played Parents and teachers say they want to know when schools will reopen in Wales Schools and colleges had already been told they would have toteach online until 18 January at the earliest, however this will now continue if cases of the virus do not fall ""materially"" before the next review date on 29 January. If cases do not drop, that would mean schools would reopen on 22 February at the earliest, and internal exams have also been cancelled. But teaching unions have warned that moreuniformed lateral flow testing needs to be in placeand teachers must be vaccinated before talks on how to reopen schools can begin. Speaking at the Welsh Government coronavirus briefing, Mr Drakeford said people working at special schools and school and college staff who were at risk would soon be vaccinated. Cardiff University has also confirmed that a phased return to in-person teaching has been cancelled, with learning continuing online for most students until 22 February. Students currently have to have hadtwo lateral flow tests confirming they are negative for Covid-19 before they return to Welsh campuses- and face to face teaching is only resuming for medical students and those who have practical parts of their courses on campus. Mr Drakeford said: ""Universities have worked hard to make sure that when students do return it is done in a careful and controlled way, with the safety of those young people and their communities at the forefront of their planning."" The announcement affecting showrooms means any retailers which allow people to browse and then order for a future date - such as kitchens, bathrooms, furniture and car sales - must close. Click and collect will still be allowed. Confirmingalert level four,externalrestrictions would continue for at least three more weeks, Mr Drakeford told Radio Wales the lockdown measures were already leading to cases falling, but the rate remained high. ""There are some positive signs that the huge collective effort we are making is making a difference, but the numbers are stubbornly high,"" he said. ""We have not yet seen an impact of those falls feeding into the number of people being admitted to hospital and becoming, sometimes, so ill they need intensive care. ""We need to see the numbers come down as well so that our NHS is genuinely able to cope with the enormous pressure it is currently facing."" Mr Drakeford said huge efforts were being made to rollout the Covid-19 vaccines, and with the ""end being in sight"" it was more important than ever for people to follow the rules and stay home. ""We have made so many sacrifices together and we mustn't stop now,"" he said. Schools in Wales closed early before the Christmas break and may not reopen until late February Schools and colleges are open for children of critical workers, as well as vulnerable learners and anyone who needs to complete essential exams or assessments All nurseries and childcare settings remain open Universities in Wales had already agreed a staggered start to term, but these are now being pushed back with learning continuing online Welsh university students studying in England should not return to campuses and will be taught online after a separatelockdownwas imposed Education Minister Kirsty Williams said: ""Schools and colleges have been safe and secure environments throughout the pandemic and that continues to be the case. ""However, the latestTAC,externalreport is clear on education's contribution. We know that school and college settings can contribute to wider social mixing outside the education environment and, right now, we all have to play our part in supressing this virus."" Ms Williams said the government would use the period until the next review date to ""look at all the possibilities for a phased and safe return of some pupils, such as those studying for qualifications, or the youngest children who find distance learning the most difficult"". Following the announcement, exams regulator Qualifications Wales cancelled the spring ""internal assessment window"" for GCSE, AS and A-level pupils, which was scheduled for 22 February - 23 April. This was introduced following the decision that exams would be cancelledin 2021. Chief executive Philip Blaker said: ""We know that learners need clarity about how they will be assessed and there will be clarity on revised arrangements soon."" Mr Drakeford said discussions were under way between teachers and education officials over ways children could catch up after missing time in school. This video can not be played This map shows the pattern of death rates involving Covid-19 by week since the pandemic began Speaking at Friday's Welsh Government coronavirus briefing, Mr Drakeford said police and local authorities would continue to crack down on people who break lockdown rules. Since the start of the pandemic, 3,585 fines have been handed out by police forces in Wales. ""Of course I want to thank everyone for following the rules and helping to keep Wales safe. It's always frustrating when a small minority act as though those rules do not apply to them,"" he added. ""I want everybody to know that where people knowingly and persistently break the rules, action will be taken. Too many lives have been lost to this awful virus to allow anybody to believe that they do not share in the responsibility that binds us all."" Unions welcomed the news saying the health and safety of pupils and staff ""had to be a priority"", but said teachers must now be given the vaccine as a priority, and pupils and staff must be protected before talks about reopening schools began. Currently teachers are not on the priority list for immunisation, and have to wait to get the jab dependent on their age and if they have a medical condition. When will I get the vaccine and what does it mean? Laura Doel, director of The National Association of Headteachers Cymru, said a ""properly organised"" testing regime needed to be put in place for schools, and special schools and pupil referral units needed support to remain open. ""Any plan that sees school staff return to face-to-face learning should be afforded as much protection as possible against the virus,"" she said.""Once these issues have been addressed, then we can discuss the orderly return to school we all want."" Meanwhile, Eithne Hughes, director of the Association of School and College Leaders Cymru said: ""I think we would be happier if we had clarity about what that date looks like, it would give confidence in the system."" Opposition parties called for clear plans on how schools would return and for support to make sure pupils from poorer backgrounds did not fall behind due to a ""digital divide"". Plaid Cymru's education spokeswoman Sian Gwenllian said: ""The Welsh Government must plan now for the gradual and safe reopening of schools, putting in place safety measures, and should lay out plans for a vaccination programme for schools staff."" Welsh Conservative education spokeswoman Suzy Davies called for the Welsh Government to publish evidence on its reasons for closing schools, bring forward vaccines for teachers, and that money must be made available for all pupils to access laptops for online learning. ""This is another bleak day for education in Wales,"" she said. ""Decisions aren't easy to make and I urge everyone involved in the journeys to and from school to consider how they might help schools open again and stay open.""

"The number of hours ambulances spent waiting to offload patients in parts of England is ""off the scale"", the Royal College of Emergency Medicine says. Data leaked to BBC News shows ambulance waiting times at hospitals in the South East rose by 36% in December compared to the same month in 2019. People are also having to wait longer for ambulances to arrive when called. Ambulance services say it is taking longer to hand over patients but they are doing all they can to meet demand. It comes as the NHS faces unprecedented pressure because of the Covid pandemic. A paramedic working in London told BBC News he had encountered patients left waiting up to 12 hours for an ambulance in the last week. One patient in London with a broken leg had to wait outside at night for six hours before an ambulance arrived to collect him, he said. On another occasion, paramedics were called to attend to a young man with Covid-19 whose oxygen levels were ""so low"". He was given oxygen when they arrived - but that was eight hours after the ambulance was called. Incidents such as these are ""dangerous"" and the service is ""on its knees"", the paramedic added. London 999 calls as high as Covid first wave peak Ambulance service records busiest day ever The figures also show that at one point on Monday this week more than 700 patients were left waiting for an ambulance to arrive in London when none was available. Different statistics obtained by BBC News highlight the number of hours spent waiting to offload patients at hospitals half an hour after ambulances arrived at hospitals in the South East. This video can not be played What does it mean if the NHS is overwhelmed? South East Coast Ambulance service lost 7,803 hours queuing outside hospitals, an increase on 5,732 hours in 2019. Kent saw the greatest rise in this period. One of its hospitals, Medway Maritime Hospital, saw a doubling in ambulance waiting times. These figures are ""off the scale"", according to Royal College of Emergency Medicine Vice President Adrian Boyle. ""It is not because more ambulances are being called, it's because the amount of time they're spending outside a hospital has increased,"" he said. Dr Boyle says ambulances left queuing outside hospitals meant crews were not available to respond to other emergencies. He says services are facing a ""crisis"" unlike any other he has seen. ""People may feel they have a winter crisis every year but this is a different order of magnitude"", he added.

"Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk said the move aimed to halt the virus at its source The Australian city of Brisbane has begun a snap three-day lockdown after a cleaner in its hotel quarantine system became infected with coronavirus. Health officials said the cleaner had the highly transmissible UK variant and they were afraid it could spread. Brisbane has seen very few cases of the virus beyond quarantined travellers since Australia's first wave last year. It is the first known instance of this variant entering the Australian community outside of hotel quarantine. The lockdown is for five populous council areas in Queensland's state capital. Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk announced the measure on Friday morning local time, about 16 hours after the woman tested positive. Ms Palaszczuk said the lockdown aimed to halt the virus as rapidly as possible, adding: ""Doing three days now could avoid doing 30 days in the future."" ""I think everybody in Queensland... knows what we are seeing in the UK and other places around the world is high rates of infection from this particular strain,"" she said. ""And we do not want to see that happening here in our great state."" New coronavirus variant: What do we know? Australia has reported 28,500 coronavirus infections and 909 deaths since the pandemic began. By contrast, the US, which is the hardest-hit country, has recorded more than 21 million infections while nearly 362,000 people have died of the disease. How Melbourne beat its second wave 'Crushed' on Melbourne's path to success This video can not be played I cycled every street allowed under Melbourneâs tough lockdown The lockdown will begin at 18:00 on Friday (08:00 GMT) in the Brisbane city, Logan and the Ipswich, Moreton and Redlands local government areas. Residents will only be allowed to leave home for certain reasons, such as buying essential items and seeking medical care. For the first time, residents in those areas will also be required to wear masks outside of their homes. Australia has faced sporadic outbreaks over the past year, with the most severe one in Melbourne triggering a lockdown for almost four months. A pre-Christmas outbreak in Sydney caused fresh alarm, but aggressive testing and contact-tracing has kept infection numbers low. The city recorded four local cases on Friday. Prime Minister Scott Morrison's government has pledged to start mass vaccinationsin February instead of March as was planned. Simon Atkinson, BBC News in Brisbane At 8:00 today I popped to the local supermarket for some bread, milk - and because it's summer here - a mango. I was pretty much the only customer. When I went past the same shop a couple of hours later it was a different story - 50 people standing in the drizzle - queuing to get inside as others emerged with bulging shopping bags. ""Heaps busier than Christmas,""  a cheery trolley attendant told me. ""It's off the scale"". People queue for groceries outside a supermarket in Brisbane on Friday Despite the ""don't panic"" messages from authorities, pictures on social media show it's a pattern being repeated across the city. While shutdowns are common around the world, the tough and sudden stay-at-home order for Brisbane has caught people on the hop here after months of near normality. But while such a rapid, hard lockdown off the back of just a single case of Covid-19 will seem crazy in some parts of the world, I've not come across too many people complaining. And I don't think that's just because Aussies love to follow a rule. This is the first time the UK variant of the virus has been detected in the community in Australia. And nobody here wants Brisbane to go through what Melbourne suffered last year. Even if it means going without mangoes.

"The storming of the US Capitol building in Washington DC stunned viewers around the world. But how did Americans feel seeing the seat of their government being ransacked? We asked members of our BBC voter panel for their views. Simon grew up in Uganda during its civil war and became a US citizen last year. A master's student and stay-at-home father, he warns that, while things may settle down, ""democracy is not guaranteed"". I'm disgusted but not surprised. I anticipated this would happen and it was a matter of when, not if. I didn't anticipate that it would happen in the capital. This is the president whose people - since the racial justice movement in the summer - said they were for ""law and order"". So the ""law and order"" people broke into the Capitol and changed the American flag with the Trump flag. History shows that has not happened in over 200 years, so it tells you how dangerous this man is. In Uganda, in November, when the opposition was arrested, people took to the streets and got shot. Here, in the summer, the Capitol building was protected and they were breaking up peaceful protests. World reacts to 'attack on US democracy' A visual guide to the Congress riots It's clear that [Trump supporters] have been organising, we've seen this was going to happen, yet we subconsciously did not think that white people are a threat. That is the construct of this country and how law enforcement viewed it. This video can not be played 'Treason, traitors and thugs'  - the words lawmakers used to describe Capitol riot Taylor is a staunch Trump supporter and recently travelled to Washington DC for a post-election pro-Trump rally. A photographer by trade, she was upset by the rioting but believes unsubstantiated claims that left-wing radicals were behind the violence. It was just heart-breaking to watch what was going on and the behaviour of protesters is just not like the Trump people I've been around. If it did come from any conservatives, then I condemn it. There's no excuse for violence. It doesn't change my support for Trump. The people that love Trump, that's not going to change no matter if he gets a second term or not. It just means we're going to hold out for 2024 and hope either he runs again or his kids do. What does a deadly day mean for Trump's legacy? Who stormed the Capitol? The deep roots of Trumpâs 'voter fraud' strategy Our country is going to go downhill over the next four years if Biden does take office. I'm actually moving today out of the city into the suburbs of a Republican county because I am afraid of how Democratic counties will end up under a Biden presidency. We're going to catapult towards socialism and communism. I'm worried for the country's future, but regardless of who takes office, we have a lot of healing to do. I hope we can all find our common humanity and embrace each other when this is all over, which is hopefully soon. James is a lifelong Republican who worked on Capitol Hill for the party for nearly two decades, but cast his first ever vote for a Democrat in the 2020 election. He was stunned by 6 January's events and expects it to become a bad footnote in the country's history. I find it absolutely shocking. I didn't think it would come to this. I had actually thought about going down to the protests with a sign that said ""Republicans Against Trump"". My brother said, if I had done that, there would have been five deaths, not four, and he may have been right. I'm astounded by the stupidity of these people who show up without masks and who are being filmed. Quite a few of them are going to prison. It's a serious situation when you break past a police barricade and go into a building that's supposed to be secure. I have a lot of friends who say things couldn't get worse, but I have to remind them, as a student of history, that it has been worse. The Civil War was much worse. There was a lot of violence in the South during the Reconstruction period. This is something the country will get over. I was heartened by President-elect Biden's speech yesterday. Finally we've got someone who's sounding presidential. We haven't had it for the last four years. This video can not be played Phone footage reveals chaotic scenes inside US Capitol A'Kayla is a college student who supports the Black Lives Matter movement. She says law enforcement ""coddled"" the rioters at the Capitol and thus made an argument for police reform because they were far more aggressive at protests she attended. It's so irritating I can't put into words how frustrating it is. They stormed the Capitol and the police were gentle and lackadaisical with them. I expected the police to use force, but they were so kind and gentle. During the summer, when the Black Lives Matter protests were going on, so many people were injured, locked up and lost their lives. From my own experience, marching peacefully on the front lines in Charleston, we had tear gas thrown at us and had to pour milk in our eyes. It was excruciating. And for what? We're marching for a cause, because we had the murder of somebody by the police. What are they upset about? They're upset because we are living in a democracy and they didn't get their way. During one of the debates, when Trump said ""stand back and stand by"", is this what he was talking about? This is the calm before the storm. I think it's going to get way more ugly, but Kamala [Harris] and Joe [Biden] are a symbol of change and hope. Whether [Trump supporters] like it or not, America is moving towards a more progressive country and there's going to be a lot of changes.

"The Liberia-flagged oil tanker Nave Andromeda docked at Southampton after the incident Seven men, including two who had already been charged, will face no action over a suspected hijacking of an oil tanker off the Isle of Wight. Special forces stormed the Nave Andromeda on 25 October after the crew raised concerns about stowaways. Matthew Okorie, 25, and Sunday Sylvester, 22, had been charged with conduct endangering ships. But prosecutors dropped their case after evidence analysis ""cast doubt"" on whether the tanker was put in danger. The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) said initial reports had indicated there was a ""real and imminent threat"" to the vessel, but added mobile phone footage and witness accounts ""could not show that the ship or crew were threatened"" and there was no evidence the men had any intention to seize control of the vessel. The CPS said the new evidence meant the ""legal test"" for the offence was ""no longer met"". ""Our case was that the actions of the men were responsible for the endangerment of the vessel, but further material was then supplied by a maritime expert which significantly undermined whether there was a threat of danger,"" prosecutors said in a statement. The Home Office said it was ""disappointed"" by the CPS's decision and added it was working with prosecutors to ""urgently resolve the issues raised by this case"". A spokesman said: ""It is frustrating that there will be no prosecution in relation to this very serious incident and the British people will struggle to understand how this can be the case."" Hampshire Constabulary said the five other men, who were arrested on suspicion of seizing or exercising control of a ship by use of threats or force, also face no police action. They will remain detained under immigration regulations. The 748ft-long (228m) ship left Lagos in Nigeria on 5 October bound for Southampton. As it approached the Isle of Wight 20 days later, an emergency call came from the ship concerned about stowaways on board while the 22 crew members had locked themselves in the ship's citadel - secure area. The men had been found on the ship earlier in the voyage and the vessel had made unsuccessful attempts to dock in other ports. It was reported the men became hostile as the tanker approached the UK - but the CPS said it was thought this may have occurred while the ship was outside of UK waters. At the time the Ministry of Defence called the incident a ""suspected hijacking"" and said Defence Secretary Ben Wallace and Home Secretary Priti Patel authorised a special forces operation in response to a police request following a 10-hour stand-off. In a nine-minute operation carried out under the cover of darkness, Special Boat Service commandos boarded the vessel and arrested the seven men, believed to be Nigerian nationals seeking asylum in the UK. The Liberian-registered tanker later docked in Southampton.

"US President Donald Trump has less than two weeks left in office, but the Senate's top Democrat has called for his presidential powers to be removed immediately after his supporters violently stormed the US Capitol on Wednesday. ""What happened at the US Capitol yesterday was an insurrection against the United States, incited by the president. This president should not hold office one day longer,"" Senator Chuck Schumer said in a statement. He added that Mike Pence should invoke the 25th Amendment, which allows for a transfer of power from the president to the vice-president, either temporarily or permanently. ""If the vice-president and the cabinet refuse to stand up, Congress should reconvene to impeach the president,"" he said. Democrats of the House Judiciary Committee have also written a letter to Vice-President Pence urging him to act to remove Donald Trump from office, saying he had stoked an act of insurrection and ""sought to undermine our democracy"".

In pictures: Pro-Trump protesters storm Capitol 'They tried to break in - then I heard a shot' The 25th Amendment allows the vice-president to become acting president when a president is unable to continue his duties, if for example, he or she becomes incapacitated due to a physical or mental illness. The part of the amendment being discussed is section four, which allows the vice-president and a majority of the cabinet to declare President Trump unable to perform his duties. Vice-President Mike Pence (L) would take over as acting president if Donald Trump's powers are removed They would need to sign a letter to the speaker of the House of Representatives and the presiding officer of the Senate declaring the president is unfit to govern or incapable ""of discharging the powers and duties of his office"".  At this point, Vice-President Mike Pence would automatically take over. The president is given the chance to offer a written response, and if he contests the finding, then it falls on Congress to decide. Any vote in the Senate and House of Representatives ordering the president's removal requires a two-thirds majority. Until the issue is resolved, the vice-president would act as president. Nancy Pelosi introduced legislation based on the 25th Amendment after President Trump's Covid-19 diagnosis Discussions about invoking the 25th Amendment also arose after President Trump's Covid-19 diagnosis in October last year, amid concern he may be too sick to run the country. What happens when a US president is too sick to work? Around the same time, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi introduced legislation based on the 25th Amendment that created a commission to review a president's fitness for office. The 25th Amendment was ratified in 1967, four years after the assassination of John F Kennedy, and was intended to address questions of presidential succession if a president becomes incapacitated. Republican President Ronald Reagan transferred powers to his vice-president for eight hours in 1985 whilst having surgery for cancer And for this reason, a number of presidents have used the amendment - specifically section three - which allows them to temporarily hand over power to their vice-presidents. In 2002 and 2007, President George W Bush placed his vice-president in charge when he was sedated during routine colonoscopies. President Ronald Reagan did the same in 1985 when he was in hospital for cancer surgery. But to date, no sitting president has ever been permanently removed using the 25th Amendment. There have been calls for President Trump to be impeached for a second time. Minnesota Democratic Congresswoman Ilhan Omar announced she was drawing up articles of impeachment against him, with a growing number of fellow Democrats voicing their support. Allow Twitter content?

Donald Trump has already been impeached once - by the Democrat-led House in December 2019 over allegations he improperly sought help from Ukraine to boost his chances of re-election. He faced two charges - abuse of power and the obstruction of Congress - but was later acquitted by the Republican-led Senate. He is only the third US president in history to have been impeached. Trump impeachment: The short, medium and long story To impeach means to bring charges in Congress that will form the basis for a trial. The US constitution states a president ""shall be removed from office on impeachment for, and conviction of, treason, bribery, or other high crimes or misdemeanours"". It is a political process, rather than a criminal one. It happens in two stages - articles are brought to the House of Representatives where, if passed, they proceed to the Senate for a trial. But here, a two-thirds vote is necessary for a president's removal - and this milestone has never been reached in US history. If President Trump were replaced through the impeachment process, Vice-President Mike Pence would move into the Oval Office. No president has ever been impeached twice during his time in office. Questions remain as to whether there would be enough time to impeach Donald Trump before his term ends on 20 January, when President-elect Joe Biden is inaugurated.

"Democrats plan to start impeachment proceedings against Donald Trump on Monday, for inciting the invasion of the US Capitol It is extremely unlikely the proceedings would clear Congress, but they could be a symbolic gesture House speaker Nancy Pelosi said she had also spoken to the military about precautions to prevent Mr Trump ordering a war or nuclear strike 'I will not be going to the inauguration"" - Donald Trump says he will break custom and snub Joe Biden's swearing-in on 20 January Five people have died in relation to the riot, including Brian Sicknick, a US Capitol Police officer Several people have been charged in connection with the violence, including a politician from West Virginia Edited by Alix Kroeger We're pausing our live coverage on the
aftermath of Wednesday's events at the US Capitol for now. Thanks for reading. The majority of Americans questioned (57%) said they thought President Donald Trump should be immediately removed from office following events in the Capitol on Wednesday, a Reuters/Ipsos poll suggests. As many as seven out of 10 Trump supporters - those who voted for Trump in November's presidential election - who participated in the national public opinion survey on Thursday and Friday condemned the violence, which led to the deaths of four civilians and a police officer. The poll useda sample of 1,005 Americans aged 18 or over.,externalThe sample included 490 Democrat voters, 363 Republican voters and a number of independent voters. The siege at the Capitol, as US Congress attempted to certify Joe Biden's victory in the presidential election, took place just hours after Trump addressed supporters and told them: ""We will never give up; we will never concede."" Following Wednesdayâs events,
there's been much discussion about whether Trump can be removed
from office, as Democrats are demanding. There are two ways that this
could be done. 25th amendment The 25th
amendment to the constitution allows the vice-president to become acting president when a sitting president
is deemed unable to continue his or her duties. Section four of the
amendment allows the vice-president and a majority of the cabinet to make this determination. Impeachment For a president to be impeached, charges must first be brought to the House and passed in a simple majority vote. It's possible the Democrats could do this next week, making Trump the first president in history to be impeached twice. Proceedings then move to the Senate but it's seen as unlikely that there would be enough time to complete the trial there. Even if this did happen, a two-thirds majority is required to vote for a president's removal, which would involve a lot of Republicans having to support it. We've put together a guide on these processes, if you'd like to read it. The FBI earlier released this image of a suspect wanted in connection with the planting of suspected pipe bombs in Washington The FBI is offering a reward of up to $50,000 (Â£37,000) for information as investigators try to track down those responsible for planting two pipe bombs in Republican and Democratic party headquarters during the attack on the US Capitol. Police received reports of suspected devices on Wednesday. Today, the FBI said in a statement that rewards would be issued on information that leads to ""the location, arrest and conviction"" of suspects. Bomb technicians used water cannon,externalto break the devices apart and render them harmless during the riots in Washington DC, ABC News reported. While rioters in the nation's capital made headlines, Trump supporters rallied at state capitols across America to protest against the election results. In the state of Washington, a crowd marched from the capitol and broke in to the grounds of the governor's mansion. This video can not be played How protests swept across the US In a break with her party, Republican Alaska Senator Lisa Murkowski says it's time for Trump to leave. ""He has caused enough damage,â Murkowskitold the Anchorage Daily News on Friday.,external ""I think he should leave. He said heâs not going to show up. Heâs not going to appear at the inauguration. He hasnât been focused on what is going on with Covid,"" she said. The senator added that Trump has been either golfing or ""fuming and throwing every single person who has been loyal and faithful to him under the bus"" - including Vice-President Mike Pence. ""He only wants to stay there for his ego. He needs to get out. He needs to do the good thing, but I donât think heâs capable of doing a good thing."" When asked about her ties to the Republican Party, Murkowski said: ""If the Republican Party has become nothing more than the party of Trump, I sincerely question whether this is the party for me."" Our North America reporter Anthony Zurcher noted that Murkowski won her senate race as a write-in candidate, and could survive without the Republican Party. A prominent left-wing activist from Utah was among the pro-Trump mob, according to multiple videos from Wednesday's invasion of the Capitol. But John Sullivan, 26, says he was just there to ""document"" it. Sullivan is the founder of Insurgence USA, which calls itself ""a group for racial justice and police reform"". In a series of media appearances after the riot, he defended his involvement, saying it was important for people ""to see the truth"" and ""see it raw"". When air force veteran and Trump supporter Ashli Babbitt was shot inside the building - the first known casualty of the violence - Sullivan and an associate were at close range. They later provided video to the Washington Post. Sullivan - who currently faces two criminal charges that stem from a separate protest in Utah - also spoke to major media outlets, including CNN and Fox News, on Wednesday and Thursday. Following these appearances, he was briefly detained by DC police, but he does not appear to have been arrested and formally charged for his role in the security breach. On the heels of the impeachment news, the White House has responded by saying this is a time for coming together. ""As President Trump said yesterday, this is a time for healing and unity as one nation,"" a White House statement to CNN reads. ""A politically motivated impeachment against a president with 12 days remaining in his term will only serve to further divide our great country."" Here's more on those impending impeachment articles. According to a four-page draft posted by NBC News, the first charge against Trump is ""incitement of insurrection"". ""Donald John Trump engaged in high Crimes and Misdemeanors by willfully inciting violence against the Government of the United States,"" the draft reads. The lawmakers accuse the president of making statements that encouraged and resulted in ""imminent lawless action at the Capitol"". The draft also says this was ""consistent with his prior efforts to subvert and obstruct"" the certification of President-elect Joe Biden's win. ""He thereby betrayed his trust as President, to the manifest injury of the people of the United States."" Three Democrats - Congressmen Ted Lieu, David Cicilline and Jamie Raskin - are planning on introducing articles of impeachment against President Trump on Monday. Articles of impeachment are charges brought against a president by the House of Rperesentatives. If the House votes to pass them, proceedings move to the Senate, which decides whether or not to convict. CBS News, the BBC's US partner, reports that the bill has nearly 160 co-sponsors in the House. The three authors reportedly began drafting it while they were sheltering-in-place during Wednesday's riot. Dozens of people have been taken into custody as the dust settles from Wednesday's violence at the US Capitol. Here are some of the offenders: Congresswoman Mary Miller had called Hitler 'right' A Republican lawmaker who had been in office for less than a week when she invoked German dictator Adolf Hitler in a Washington speech has apologised for saying that she agreed with the mass murderer. Illinois Congresswoman Mary Miller had said in a speech on Tuesday outside the Capitol, one day before her fellow Trump supporters ransacked the building, that Hitler had been ""right"". Miller told the crowd: ""You know, if we win a few elections weâre still going to be losing unless we win the hearts of our children. ""Itâs the battle. Hitler was right on one thing - that whoever has the youth has the future.""  Hitler, among his supporters in Germany in 1933 The comments drew large-scale condemnation, with the US Holocaust Memorial Museum saying in a statement that it ""unequivocally condemns any leader trying to advance a position by claiming Adolf Hitler was âright.â"" Under Hitler, millions of Jews and other minority groups were murdered across Europe by Germany and its allies during World War Two. On Friday, Miller insisted that she is not anti-semitic and accused other of ""trying to intentionally twist my words"". ""I sincerely apologise for any harm my words caused and regret using a reference to one of the most evil dictators in history to illustrate the dangers that outside influences can have on our youth,"" she said. Correction 23rd
June 2022: This post originally described Mary Miller as having praised Hitler
and has been amended to make clear that she invoked Hitler in her speech. Lindsey Graham, a senior Republican member of the US Senate, is the latest target of harassment by Trump supporters in Washington DC. On Wednesday - after an armed mob invaded the US Capitol building - Graham joined other members of Congress in returning to certify the election results. In a speech before his colleagues, he declared Joe Biden to be ""lawfully elected"" and thus ""the legitimate president"". On Friday, a crowd of angry Trump loyalists confronted him in a DC-area airport, labelling him a ""traitor"". ""You don't represent us anymore,"" shouted one, as Graham - surrounded by security - walked away. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Earlier this week, videos posted to social media showed another 
pro-Trump crowd heckling another Republican senator - Mitt Romney - both
 while he waited for his flight and on board the plane. In 
response to this week's events, the Association of Flight Attendants - a
 labour union that represents nearly 50,000 flight attendants - called 
for a travel blacklist of such passengers for unruly conduct that 
endangers flight safety. Zhaoyin FengBBC Chinese, Washington DC When Washington is mired in division and 
dysfunction, the leadership in Beijing is consolidating power, silencing
 dissent and advancing technologies. China is able to leverage the lack of stability in 
the US to promote two of its arguments. The first one is that democracy 
is messy and potentially violent, which does not make it an ideal political 
model for China. Second, the West is applying a double standard in its behaviour toward China. Foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua 
Chunying drew comparisons between the Washington riots with 
pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong: âSeeing those scenes in the United 
States has brought back a sense of dÃ©jÃ  vu.â She criticised
 western politicians and media for glorifying the Hong Kong protesters 
while condemning those storming into the US Congress. As many have pointed out, despite the superficial 
similarities of the two events, they are fundamentally different. Hong 
Kong activists were demanding a fully democratic election, while the 
Capitol rioters were trying to overturn the result
 of such a vote. But there is little doubt the mayhem in the US
 has reinforced Beijingâs messages and further damaged Washingtonâs 
reputation around the globe. Analysts have labeled the Capitol siege as the day 
when ""the post-American era"" began. Many in and outside of China 
believe the new era will be âthe China centuryâ. If that's so, what would it look like? This is just one among the many
 big questions arising from the extraordinary events in Washington this 
week. Tara McKelveyBBC News, Washington In the wake of Wednesday's assault, dozens of people have been arrested - many for curfew violations - but most of the culprits of the Capitol building break-in remain at large. These intruders could be charged with an array of crimes, ranging from trespassing and other relatively minor ones to serious offences involving firearms and explosive devices. They could be sentenced to many years in prison. Which is why the FBI is now asking: do you recognise anyone in this picture? If so, agents want to hear from you. They want everyone in Washington DC, and across the US, to join their crime-solving team. Read the full story about the FBI's outreach and citizen-sleuthing here. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau began his press conference today by addressing the ""assault on democracy by violent rioters"" that he says was ""incited by the current president and other politicians"". He says that US democracy has shown itself to be ""resilient"" since Wednesday's raid, adding that he has discussed the situation with the premiers of Canada's provinces last night. ""Democracy is not automatic. It takes work every day,"" says the liberal leader who has been forced to bite his tongue on more than a few occasion over the last four years. This video can not be played Justin Trudeau: DC riot was 'assault on democracy' President-elect Biden says there should be a full investigation into the security breakdown at the Capitol. He emphasised that the rioters who broke in were ""thugs"". ""These are a bunch of thugs. They're terrorists, domestic terrorists,"" he said, adding that they should be prosecuted. Biden also said the unfolding of the situation, with the ""active encouragement of a sitting president"", should be investigated. ""The idea that thousands of people could be marching up the steps of the United States Capitol, breaking the windows, breaking doors, forcing their way in... and it looked like you had some of the Capitol police taking selfies with these people. ""That has to be thoroughly investigated, the authorities responsible have to be held accountable for the failures that occurred and we have to make sure that this can never ever happen again."" Biden added: ""This reminded me more of states I've visited...in tin horn dictatorships."" Asked if he believes that law enforcement will be able to secure his inauguration ceremony on 20 January, when he officially takes over the keys to the White House, Biden says he has ""great confidence in the Secret Service"" and the inauguration committee. ""I have confidence in the planning that has been underway before this and continues with the Secret Service,"" he says during his speech from Delaware. When asked how he feels about Trump skipping the inauguration ceremony, Biden calls the decision ""one of the few things he and I agree on,"" adding that is a good thing Trump won't be there. Biden adds that Vice-President Mike Pence - who certified Biden's win on Wednesday after lawmakers retook control of the chamber - is still ""welcome"" to attend. President-elect Joe Biden says he's more focused on addressing the pandemic than impeaching his predecessor. When asked about Democrats in the House of Representatives saying they would introduce articles of impeachment against Donald Trump, Biden said his ""number one concern"" was getting Covid under control. ""I'm focused on the virus, vaccine and economic growth,"" Biden answered, adding that he plans on introducing legislation immediately upon taking office to deal with the virus and the economy. ""What the Congress decides to do is for them to decide,"" he said. ""We're gonna do our job and Congress can decide how to proceed with theirs.""

But he told BBC World News it didn't mean he wouldn't face charges. ""The president can only pardon people for their offences against federal law,"" Prof Ackerman said. ""There is every reason to believe, however, that President Trump will be charged with a large number of criminal offences especially under the law of the state of New York,"" he added.

"The storming of the US Capitol building in Washington DC stunned viewers around the world. But how did Americans feel seeing the seat of their government being ransacked? We asked members of our BBC voter panel for their views. Simon grew up in Uganda during its civil war and became a US citizen last year. A master's student and stay-at-home father, he warns that, while things may settle down, ""democracy is not guaranteed"". I'm disgusted but not surprised. I anticipated this would happen and it was a matter of when, not if. I didn't anticipate that it would happen in the capital. This is the president whose people - since the racial justice movement in the summer - said they were for ""law and order"". So the ""law and order"" people broke into the Capitol and changed the American flag with the Trump flag. History shows that has not happened in over 200 years, so it tells you how dangerous this man is. In Uganda, in November, when the opposition was arrested, people took to the streets and got shot. Here, in the summer, the Capitol building was protected and they were breaking up peaceful protests. World reacts to 'attack on US democracy' A visual guide to the Congress riots It's clear that [Trump supporters] have been organising, we've seen this was going to happen, yet we subconsciously did not think that white people are a threat. That is the construct of this country and how law enforcement viewed it. This video can not be played 'Treason, traitors and thugs'  - the words lawmakers used to describe Capitol riot Taylor is a staunch Trump supporter and recently travelled to Washington DC for a post-election pro-Trump rally. A photographer by trade, she was upset by the rioting but believes unsubstantiated claims that left-wing radicals were behind the violence. It was just heart-breaking to watch what was going on and the behaviour of protesters is just not like the Trump people I've been around. If it did come from any conservatives, then I condemn it. There's no excuse for violence. It doesn't change my support for Trump. The people that love Trump, that's not going to change no matter if he gets a second term or not. It just means we're going to hold out for 2024 and hope either he runs again or his kids do. What does a deadly day mean for Trump's legacy? Who stormed the Capitol? The deep roots of Trumpâs 'voter fraud' strategy Our country is going to go downhill over the next four years if Biden does take office. I'm actually moving today out of the city into the suburbs of a Republican county because I am afraid of how Democratic counties will end up under a Biden presidency. We're going to catapult towards socialism and communism. I'm worried for the country's future, but regardless of who takes office, we have a lot of healing to do. I hope we can all find our common humanity and embrace each other when this is all over, which is hopefully soon. James is a lifelong Republican who worked on Capitol Hill for the party for nearly two decades, but cast his first ever vote for a Democrat in the 2020 election. He was stunned by 6 January's events and expects it to become a bad footnote in the country's history. I find it absolutely shocking. I didn't think it would come to this. I had actually thought about going down to the protests with a sign that said ""Republicans Against Trump"". My brother said, if I had done that, there would have been five deaths, not four, and he may have been right. I'm astounded by the stupidity of these people who show up without masks and who are being filmed. Quite a few of them are going to prison. It's a serious situation when you break past a police barricade and go into a building that's supposed to be secure. I have a lot of friends who say things couldn't get worse, but I have to remind them, as a student of history, that it has been worse. The Civil War was much worse. There was a lot of violence in the South during the Reconstruction period. This is something the country will get over. I was heartened by President-elect Biden's speech yesterday. Finally we've got someone who's sounding presidential. We haven't had it for the last four years. This video can not be played Phone footage reveals chaotic scenes inside US Capitol A'Kayla is a college student who supports the Black Lives Matter movement. She says law enforcement ""coddled"" the rioters at the Capitol and thus made an argument for police reform because they were far more aggressive at protests she attended. It's so irritating I can't put into words how frustrating it is. They stormed the Capitol and the police were gentle and lackadaisical with them. I expected the police to use force, but they were so kind and gentle. During the summer, when the Black Lives Matter protests were going on, so many people were injured, locked up and lost their lives. From my own experience, marching peacefully on the front lines in Charleston, we had tear gas thrown at us and had to pour milk in our eyes. It was excruciating. And for what? We're marching for a cause, because we had the murder of somebody by the police. What are they upset about? They're upset because we are living in a democracy and they didn't get their way. During one of the debates, when Trump said ""stand back and stand by"", is this what he was talking about? This is the calm before the storm. I think it's going to get way more ugly, but Kamala [Harris] and Joe [Biden] are a symbol of change and hope.

"This video can not be played Trump calls for an 'orderly transition of power' to the Biden administration on January 20th A US Capitol police officer has died from injuries sustained in the attack on Congress by a pro-Trump mob as top Democrats have called for the president to be removed for ""inciting"" the riot. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi urged Vice-President Mike Pence to invoke the 25th amendment to the Constitution to declare the president unfit for office. Alternatively, she vowed to initiate the process to impeach the president. Under pressure, Donald Trump finally condemned the ""heinous attack"". Wednesday's violence came hours after Mr Trump encouraged his supporters to fight against the election results as Congress was certifying President-elect Joe Biden's victory in the November vote. Five people have died in relation to the riot, including Brian Sicknick, an officer at the US Capitol Police (USCP) who was ""injured while physically engaging with protesters"", the police said. Americans 'shocked' and 'disgusted' by riots A visual guide to the Congress riots The US Air Force veteran who lost her life in riots Meanwhile, the top congressional Democrats - Speaker Pelosi and Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer - have urged Vice-President Pence and Mr Trump's cabinet to remove the president for ""his incitement of insurrection"". ""The President's dangerous and seditious acts necessitate his immediate removal from office,"" they said in a joint statement. The duo called forMr Trump to be ousted using the 25th Amendment, which allows the vice-president to step up if the president is unable to perform his duties owing to a mental or physical illness. But it would require Mr Pence and at least eight cabinet members to break with Mr Trump and invoke the amendment, something they have so far seemed unlikely to do. Mr Trump is due to leave office on 20 January, when Mr Biden will be sworn in. This video can not be played Phone footage reveals chaotic scenes inside US Capitol Mrs Pelosi indicated that if the vice-president failed to act, she would convene the House to launch their second impeachment proceedings against Mr Trump. However, to succeed in convicting and removing the president, Democrats would need a two-thirds majority in the Senate, and there is no indication they would get those numbers. And it was not clear whether enough time remained to carry out the process. Mrs Pelosi's deputy, Katherine Clark, told CNN the House could move on impeachment next week. Media reports, quoting unnamed sources, said Mr Trump had suggested to aides he was considering granting a pardon to himself in the final days of his presidency.The legality of such a move is untested. It wasn't until Thursday night, more than 24 hours after the US Capitol had been ransacked by his supporters, that Donald Trump released a recorded statement calling for ""healing and reconciliation"" in a wounded nation. That was the very least that could be expected from a US president in a time of crises, and it probably will not be enough to silence calls for his removal, impeachment or resignation. Those demands have been coming from the political left, of course, but also from parts of the right  - longtime critics, from former allies and, remarkably, even the conservative editorial page of Rupert Murdoch's Wall Street Journal. Ever since November's election, when Trump chose to attack the results rather than admit defeat, a reckoning was coming. The pressure, like a malfunctioning steam engine, was building toward a catastrophic ending. On Thursday night, the president began trying to pick up the pieces. Teleprompter Trump had spoken. In past crises, unscripted Trump has quickly returned, with words and actions that reveal his earlier comments were insincere. With 12 days left in his presidency, the question is whether, or more likely when, that Trump will return - and what happens when he does. President Trump returned to Twitter on Thursdayfollowing a 12-hour freeze of his account. His message was the closest he has come to a formal acceptance of his defeat after weeks of falsely insisting he actually won the election in a ""landslide"". ""Now Congress has certified the results a new administration will be inaugurated on January 20th,"" the Republican said in a video, without mentioning Mr Biden by name. ""My focus now turns to ensuring a smooth, orderly and seamless transition of power. This moment calls for healing and reconciliation."" This video can not be played 'Treason, traitors and thugs'  - the words lawmakers used to describe Capitol riot Mr Trump said he had ""immediately deployed"" the National Guard to expel the intruders, though some US media reported he had hesitated to send in the troops, leaving his vice-president to give the order. He also praised his ""wonderful supporters"" and promised ""our incredible journey is only just beginning"". Law enforcement have been heavily criticised after they were overrun by the protesters. Mr Biden said: ""Nobody could tell me that if it was a group of Black Lives Matter protesters yesterday they wouldn't have been treated very differently than the thugs that stormed the Capitol."" Images captured inside the Capitol building showed protesters roaming through some of the corridors unimpeded. The FBI is seeking to identify those involved in the rampage, andthe Washington DC police have released pictures of ""persons of interest"" for their involvement in the riot.,externalThe Department of Justice says people could face charges of seditious conspiracy, as well as rioting and insurrection. Questions mount over security failure How the 25th Amendment could be used Who stormed the Capitol? Washington police say 68 people have so far been arrested. One of those detained at the Capitol had a ""military-style automatic weapon and 11 Molotov cocktails (petrol bombs)"", according to the federal attorney for Washington DC. The official responsible for security in the House of Representatives, the sergeant at arms, has resigned. Mr Schumer has called for his counterpart in the Senate to be sacked. USCP chief Steven Sund is also resigning, effective 16 January, following calls from Mrs Pelosi. On Thursday, crews began installing a non-scalable 7ft (2m) fence around the Capitol which will remain in place for at least 30 days. This video can not be played Joe Biden: Black Lives Matter protesters would have been treated ""differently"" Ashli Babbitt, a 35-year-old US Air Force veteran from San Diego, California,was named as the woman fatally shot by a police officerwho has now been placed on leave. Law enforcement told US media the victim was unarmed. Three others died after sufferingÂ unspecified medical emergencies on Capitol grounds: Benjamin Philips, 50, from Pennsylvania; Kevin Greeson, 55, from Alabama; and Rosanne Boyland, 34, from Georgia. Mr Greeson's family said he died of a heart attack. Police said that 14 officers had been injured in the riot. On Thursday evening, Education Secretary Betsy DeVos - one of the longest serving members of the president's administration - became the second cabinet member to quit following the Capitol riot. In her resignation letter, Ms DeVos accused the president of fomenting Wednesday's disorder. ""There is no mistaking the impact your rhetoric had on the situation, and it is the inflection point for me."" Earlier in the day, Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao stepped down, saying she had been ""deeply troubled"" by the rampage. Other aides to quit include special envoy Mick Mulvaney, a senior national security official, and the chief of staff to First Lady Melania Trump.

"Former Det Insp Tim Ireson led the unit for two years and would have been sacked if he was still serving Three members of a ""toxic"" police unit have been sacked for gross misconduct after their ""offensive"" conversations were secretly bugged. The devices picked up ""homophobic, racist and sexist"" conversations in the offices of Hampshire's Serious and Organised Crime Unit in Basingstoke in 2018, a misconduct panel heard. A number of force staff referred to it as a ""lads' pad"". Two other officers would have been sacked but had already left the force. The misconduct hearing was told in the 24 days the office was bugged - following concerns raised by a whistleblower - there was ""enough profanity, casual sexism and racism to last a lifetime"". Det Sgt Oliver Lage, Det Sgt Gregory Willcox and PC James Oldfield have been dismissed while retired Det Insp Tim Ireson and former PC Craig Bannerman were the two who had previously left the force. Trainee Det Con Andrew Ferguson, who sent colleagues a fake pornographic image of members of the royal family, has been given a final written warning. The six men were based at the Serious and Organised Crime Unit in Basingstoke Imposing the sanctions, panel chairman John Bassett said the conduct had been ""shameful"". He said police officers could not ""pick and choose the standards they will abide by"" in order to create more ""cohesive"" teams. Mr Bassett said PC Ferguson was ""essentially a good officer"" who joined the team three months before the recordings, by which time the ""culture was well-established"". He said the officer was ""conflicted by what he witnessed"" and ""felt unable to raise the matter with a supervisor"". Chief Constable Olivia Pinkney said the force's internal investigation had revealed a ""catalogue of sexist, racist, homophobic and ableist language and commentary that has rightly shocked us all"". She added: ""These officers have failed to deliver on the promise they made to uphold fundamental human rights and accord equal respect to all people. ""[They] have undermined the trust and confidence of our communities and damaged the reputations of their colleagues."" The six officers have apologised but some told the disciplinary panel swearing was in the ""fabric"" of the police force. One also said they felt they were being ""made an example of"" by the force which should have learned from other previous incidents. In all, 20 police officers and staff from the unit have faced some sort of disciplinary action. During the misconduct hearing at Hampshire Constabulary's headquarters in Eastleigh, it was heard a ""toxic, abhorrent culture"" developed with officers using offensive terms for women, black people, immigrants, disabled, gay and transgender people and foreign nationals. Jason Beer QC, prosecuting, said the only black member of the team was referred to using racist tropes and references to slavery. Women were described using derogatory terms and stared at in the canteen, he added. The men admitted some of the charges of breaching standards of professional behaviour against them but claimed it only amounted to misconduct not gross misconduct. Zoe Wakefield, chair of Hampshire Police Federation, said: ""The outdated and offensive views we heard during the hearing have no place in society and they certainly have no place in policing. ""We should not let the awful language and terminology used by a very small number of police officers tarnish the hard work and dedication of thousands of police officers and staff in Hampshire..."" 'Toxic' police unit officers guilty of misconduct Officers 'permitted toxic culture in police unit' Detective breaks down at misconduct hearing Offensive words 'widely used' in police force Police officer 'used work email' for football club Officers 'shared fake explicit images of royals' Police unit 'homophobic, racist and sexist' Hampshire Constabulary Popular Southampton Pub Relaunches With Brand-New Menu and Glamourous Look Portsmouth Covid loan company directors âsleepwalkingâ into disqualification Queen Anne departs Southampton for historic maiden world voyage Hampshire County Council urges Government to delay May elections Service of thanksgiving for former Alton mayor Paddy Mendham Southampton death notices: Tributes to 12 people who have died At least 10 confirmed dead in Los Angeles wildfires What's the latest on the LA fires, and what caused them?

"The UK's Covid vaccine campaign has shifted its focus to boosters - an attempt to reduce the impact of the Omicron variant. Almost seven in 10 of those aged 12 or over in the UK have had a booster, while nine in 10 have had a single jab and more than eight in 10 have had a second dose. But despite more than 38 million boosters, or third doses, being given so far, more people are being urged to come forward and jabs are being rolled out to all five to 11-year-olds. The vaccine rollout was launched in winter 2020 and began with those considered most vulnerable before later moving down the adult age groups. All those aged 12 and over are eligible for two full doses while all five to 11-year-olds are now being offered two low-dose jabs, at least 12 weeks apart. Booster jabs are also available to all over-16s, as well as children aged 12-15 in at-risk groups. The JCVI says a fourth Covid jab is not yet needed because data shows, three months after a booster shot, people aged 65 and over still haveabout 90% protection against hospitalisation. The UK has approved five vaccines for use: Pfizer-BioNTech, Oxford-AstraZeneca, Moderna, Janssen and Novavax; four of which require two doses for maximum protection. Those receiving boosters have so far been receiving one dose of Pfizer or half a dose of Moderna. So far, more than 52 million people have had a first vaccine dose - some 92% of over-12s.  More than 49 million - 85% of over-12s - have had both doses. While uptake of first and second doses dropped off late last year, there was a steep rise in people having boosters. However, booster numbers dipped over the Christmas holiday period and remain low. More than 38 million booster doses have been administered across the UK so far. Overall vaccination rates have now levelled off in every age group in England apart from the youngest bands. The aim of the vaccination programme is toprotect as many people as possible from serious illness,externalthrough developing the UK population's immunity against Covid-19. Data from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) suggests more thannine in 10 adults,externalin the UK now have coronavirus antibodies - which is evidence of a past Covid infection or having received at least one dose of a vaccine. However, this figure does not tell us how many people are protected from infection or how close we are to reaching herd immunity - the point at which everyone is protected, directly or indirectly, as a result of high immunity levels in the population. Will a vaccine give us our old lives back? Is Covid at risk of becoming a disease of the poor? Across the country, there continues to be some variation in the vaccine programme. Scotland has vaccinated 93% of those aged 12 and over with at least one dose, while England and Wales have hit 92% and Northern Ireland 89%. Second doses are also being rolled out, with all nations reaching more than 80% of over-12s so far. Across the English regions, the South West has vaccinated 87% of the same age group with at least one dose, while London has reached 70%. When looking at boosters, the South West has reached 68% of people aged 12 and over, while for London the figure is 46%. There have also been disparities between ethnic groups and poorer and wealthier areas. Analysis of NHS records by theOpenSAFELY group,external- a collaboration between Oxford University and the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine - shows that black people were the least likely to have received a booster vaccine. The study was based on more than 20 million patient records in England and covers people not living in care homes. Areas of London are under-represented in the data. In addition, booster take-up in poorer areas is lower than in more affluent areas. Currently, the Pfizer-BioNTech, Oxford-AstraZeneca, Moderna, Novavax and one-shot Janssen vaccines are approved for use throughout the UK. Others, such that produced by CureVac, have not yet been given the green light. The UK had ordered more than 540 million doses of seven of the most promising vaccines, including the four so far approved for use. In addition, the government has now signed deals to buy 114 million more doses of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines to use in 2022 and 2023. French vaccine maker Valneva said the UK government had scrapped a deal for 100m doses of its vaccine, which is yet to be approved. LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area?

"Police have issued CCTV footage of a man they want to speak to in connection with the incident A fraudster claiming to work for the NHS injected a 92-year-old woman with a fake Covid-19 vaccine, City of London Police has said. Detectives are hunting the man who charged the victim in Surbiton, south-west London, Â£160. Police said it was ""crucial"" he was caught as soon as possible as he ""may endanger people's lives"". Det Insp Kevin Ives described it as a ""disgusting and totally unacceptable assault"". It comes after the NHS warned people that no-one should be turning up at doorsteps offering a vaccine for payment,following a spate of fake text messages. Under the current coronavirus vaccine rollout plans, people will be invited to receive the vaccine by their GP or healthcare provider. Police said the victim allowed the man into her home on the afternoon of 30 December after he said he was from the NHS and there to administer the Covid-19 vaccine. She said she was jabbed in the arm with a ""dart-like implement"" before being charged Â£160, which the man said would be refunded by the NHS. Everything you need to know about the Covid vaccine in the UK Police said it was not known what substance, if any, was administered, but the woman had been checked at her local hospital and showed no ill effects. Det Insp Ives appealed for information to help identify the suspect. He added: ""It is crucial we catch him as soon as possible as not only is he defrauding individuals of money, he may endanger people's lives."" The man made a second visit to the woman's home on 4 January, when he asked for another Â£100, police said. The man was spotted in the Tolworth area of Kingston-upon-Thames on 4 January Officers released CCTV footage on Friday of a man dressed in a navy blue tracksuit with white stripes down the side, who they want to speak to in connection with the incident. He is described as a white man in his early 30s, who is about 5ft 9ins (1.75m) tall, of medium build, with light brown hair that is combed back. He speaks with a London accent. A spokesman for the Department of Health said: ""NHS England will never ask for bank details, Pin numbers or passwords, when contacting you about a vaccination. ""Any communication which claims to be from the NHS but asks for payment, or bank details, is fraudulent and can be ignored. It can be reported to police viaAction Fraud,external.

"Marks & Spencer has temporarily stopped selling hundreds of items in its Northern Ireland stores due to Brexit red tape. The retailer said it feared its food would be blocked due to new rules governing shipments between Great Britain and Northern Ireland. A growing number of firms have spoken out about paperwork delays at ports. The government said traders and hauliers need to take steps to comply with new border rules. M&S took the decision to temporarily drop hundreds of products, including chocolate fudge pudding and sweet and sour chicken, from its Northern Ireland stores after it saw competitors' lorries barred from travelling between the mainland and Northern Ireland. An entire consignment in a lorry can be held up if only one item in the truck doesn't have the correct customs forms filled out. The retailer said it aimed to get the products back up for sale soon. An M&S spokesperson said: ""We have served customers in Northern Ireland for over 50 years and our priority is to make sure we continue to deliver the same choice and great quality range that our loyal customers have always enjoyed. ""Stores have been receiving regular deliveries this week, however following the UK's recent departure from the EU, we are transitioning to new processes and we're working closely with our partners and suppliers to ensure customers can continue to enjoy a great range of products."" In addition to problems shipping goods internally in the UK, the new Brexit trade rules are creating problems for exporters and traders transporting goods to and from the EU, say firms. The UK sealed a trade deal with the European Union (EU) on 24 December that was billed as preserving its zero-tariff and zero-quota access to the bloc's single market. But in addition to red tape causing delays, major retailers that use the UK as a distribution hub for European business could face possible tariffs if they re-export goods to the EU. On Friday, M&S chief executive Steve Rowe warned of more red tape and a rise in export costs to some countries. ""The best example I can give you of that is Percy Pig,"" he said, ""Percy Pig is actually manufactured in Germany. If it comes to the UK and we then send it to Ireland, in theory it would have some tax on it,"" he added. M&S said it was ""actively working to mitigate"" the effects of the ""rules of origin"" regulations, under which products are taxed differently depending on which country they come from. Other firms have also been hit by the confusion caused by new Brexit trading rules. Parcels giant DPD has suspended some services, while seafood exporter John Ross said the chaos was like being ""thrown in the cold Atlantic without a lifejacket"". Shane Brennan, chief executive of the Cold Chain Federation, which represents chilled transport and storage companies, said the emerging problems had come despite the amount of cross-border traffic still being quite low. ""Trade flows are still only about 50% of what we would expect, but even at those levels we are seeing levels of confusion and delays,"" he told the BBC's Today programme. ""The feeling is we are building to quite a significant potential disruption."" John Lewis scrapping overseas deliveries Were there hold-ups in first week after Brexit? Why are there empty shelves in some supermarkets? Covid tests for Channel hauliers to continue A government spokesman acknowledged that there had been ""some issues"", but said ministers had always been clear there would be some disruption at the end of the transition period. The Cabinet Office said in a statement that the volume of border crossings had been low so far this year, but that it expected crossings to steadily increase to normal levels. This brings the potential for ""significant disruption if traders and hauliers have not taken the necessary steps to comply with the new rules,"" the Cabinet Office said. Out of about 1,500 lorries per day trying to get from Great Britain to the EU in the new year, 700 have been turned away - mainly due to a lack of a negative Covid test for drivers, it said. ""We have always been clear there would be changes now that we are out of the customs union and single market, so full compliance with the new rules is vital to avoid disruption,"" said Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove. However, anger is growing among companies whose livelihoods depend on export trade. In a letter on Friday to Business Secretary Alok Sharma, Scottish salmon producer John Ross Jr launched a stinging attack on the government's handling of the situation. The firm's sales director, Victoria Leigh-Pearson, wrote that the company had in recent months ""had to endure the government issuing a barrage of useless information"" and an ""absence of factually correct information from all government agencies."" It amounted, she said, to ""gross incompetence"". John Ross exports to 36 countries and has won the Queen's Award twice Part of the letter to Alok Sharma: As I write, perishable goods that were dispatched from our facility five days ago, headed for France following a process that your department advised, have still not crossed the border. This usually takes only 24 hours because they are consolidated with the produce of other companies, which have not been able to follow the correct procedures due to a knowledge gap directly attributable to your department. Entire trucks are currently being rejected without explanation by the French customs authority. Our hauliers have now pulled their services as such a backlog has been created. Other hauliers are not taking on new customers. Today, we've even had confirmation that the IT systems of the UK and France are incompatible. After four years you only establish this now? Your so-called 'deal' is worthless if this situation is not fixed immediately, and unless you put in place measures to address the issues that continue to unfold on a daily basis. Moreover, as a seafood exporter, it feels as though our own government has thrown us into the cold Atlantic waters without a lifejacket. Yours sincerely, Victoria Leigh-Pearson, Sales Director, John Ross John Ross is not the only Scottish seafood exporter suffering. The industry says it has been hit by a ""perfect storm"" of Brexit disruption, which could sink a centuries-old industry. ""These businesses are not transporting toilet rolls or widgets. They are exporting the highest quality, perishable seafood which has a finite window to get to markets in peak condition,"" said Donna Fordyce, chief executive of Seafood Scotland. ""If the window closes, these consignments go to landfill."" She said the sector has already been weakened by Covid-19, the closure of the French border before Christmas as well as ""layer upon layer"" of problems associated with Brexit. The group fears that without exports, the fishing fleet will have little reason to go out. ""In a very short time, we could see the destruction of a centuries-old market which contributes significantly to the Scottish economy,"" added Ms Fordyce. UK government Minister for Scotland David Duguid blamed Scottish leaders for the issues. ""The Scottish Government has persistently refused to accept the democratic vote to leave the EU, but that does not allow them to abdicate their responsibilities to Scottish businesses,"" he said. ""Over the past 18 months they have assured the fishing industry that the systems they were putting in place would be adequate. They clearly are not."" Parcel delivery service DPD UK said it had paused its European Road Service because of the '""increased burden"" of customs paperwork for packages heading to the EU, including the Republic of Ireland. DPD said 20% of parcels had ""incorrect or incomplete data attached"", which meant they would have to be returned. This video can not be played What Brexit means for Britons travelling, shopping, studying or owning properties in the EU. In an email to its business customers, the company said that it had been a ""challenging few days"" for its international operation, and that it would ""pause and review"" its service.  It plans to restart on 13 January. ""It has now become evident that we have an increased burden with the new, more complex processes, and additional customs data we require from you for your parcels destined to Europe"" the firm wrote. The boss of one of Wales' largest hauliers said logistical problems have emerged at the Irish border too. Andrew Kinsella, managing director of Gwynedd Shipping, said his company has a backlog of 60 lorries waiting to be shipped to Dublin. He said many hauliers are finding that their customers are not able to generate the special declarations that are needed to ultimately enable a lorry to get onto a ferry. ""Whilst you don't see queues at ports and terminals the reality is that these queues are developing elsewhere in our depot in Holyhead, in our depot in Deeside and in our depot in Newport in South Wales, and lots of hauliers have depots in the proximity of ports,"" he said. ""There are a lot of issues about demarcation about who is going to arrange the export declaration with the UK revenue authorities, who's going to arrange the import declaration, the hauliers then trying to arrange the import safety and security declaration to create an ENS number which helps you generate a PBN number so there has been a lot of everyone finding their feet"".

"Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk said the move aimed to halt the virus at its source The Australian city of Brisbane has begun a snap three-day lockdown after a cleaner in its hotel quarantine system became infected with coronavirus. Health officials said the cleaner had the highly transmissible UK variant and they were afraid it could spread. Brisbane has seen very few cases of the virus beyond quarantined travellers since Australia's first wave last year. It is the first known instance of this variant entering the Australian community outside of hotel quarantine. The lockdown is for five populous council areas in Queensland's state capital. Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk announced the measure on Friday morning local time, about 16 hours after the woman tested positive. Ms Palaszczuk said the lockdown aimed to halt the virus as rapidly as possible, adding: ""Doing three days now could avoid doing 30 days in the future."" ""I think everybody in Queensland... knows what we are seeing in the UK and other places around the world is high rates of infection from this particular strain,"" she said. ""And we do not want to see that happening here in our great state."" New coronavirus variant: What do we know? Australia has reported 28,500 coronavirus infections and 909 deaths since the pandemic began. By contrast, the US, which is the hardest-hit country, has recorded more than 21 million infections while nearly 362,000 people have died of the disease. How Melbourne beat its second wave 'Crushed' on Melbourne's path to success This video can not be played I cycled every street allowed under Melbourneâs tough lockdown The lockdown will begin at 18:00 on Friday (08:00 GMT) in the Brisbane city, Logan and the Ipswich, Moreton and Redlands local government areas. Residents will only be allowed to leave home for certain reasons, such as buying essential items and seeking medical care. For the first time, residents in those areas will also be required to wear masks outside of their homes. Australia has faced sporadic outbreaks over the past year, with the most severe one in Melbourne triggering a lockdown for almost four months. A pre-Christmas outbreak in Sydney caused fresh alarm, but aggressive testing and contact-tracing has kept infection numbers low. The city recorded four local cases on Friday. Prime Minister Scott Morrison's government has pledged to start mass vaccinationsin February instead of March as was planned. Simon Atkinson, BBC News in Brisbane At 8:00 today I popped to the local supermarket for some bread, milk - and because it's summer here - a mango. I was pretty much the only customer. When I went past the same shop a couple of hours later it was a different story - 50 people standing in the drizzle - queuing to get inside as others emerged with bulging shopping bags. ""Heaps busier than Christmas,""  a cheery trolley attendant told me. ""It's off the scale"". People queue for groceries outside a supermarket in Brisbane on Friday Despite the ""don't panic"" messages from authorities, pictures on social media show it's a pattern being repeated across the city. While shutdowns are common around the world, the tough and sudden stay-at-home order for Brisbane has caught people on the hop here after months of near normality. But while such a rapid, hard lockdown off the back of just a single case of Covid-19 will seem crazy in some parts of the world, I've not come across too many people complaining. And I don't think that's just because Aussies love to follow a rule. This is the first time the UK variant of the virus has been detected in the community in Australia. And nobody here wants Brisbane to go through what Melbourne suffered last year. Even if it means going without mangoes.

"This video can not be played Education minister Kirsty Williams says online learning must continue for now Schools and colleges in Wales will stay closed to most pupils until the February half term unless there is a ""significant"" fall in Covid cases. First Minister Mark Drakeford also confirmedcurrent lockdown restrictionswould be extended and ""strengthened"". This means non-essential retail, hospitality venues, licensed premises and leisure facilities remain closed and showrooms must now shut as well. Mr Drakeford said: ""The pandemic has reached a significant point."" He told BBC Radio Wales the announcement was the ""best certainty"" he could offer parents, pupils and teachers, ""in a world which is highly uncertain and where things change almost every single day"". The phased return to face-to-face learning at some Welsh universities has also been postponed, while internal GCSE, A-level and AS-level assessments have been cancelled. The announcement follows a similar move in England, where Prime Minister Boris Johnson has already saidschools would not open before half term. Spring half term in Wales is scheduled to take place the week beginning Monday 15 February. Wales has been in analert level four lockdown since 20 Decemberin an attempt to reduce the transmission of coronavirus. On Thursday,63 further deaths from coronaviruswere reported by Public Health Wales. What are Wales' lockdown rules? What is the latest Covid advice for children? School closures 'throwing children under the bus' Speaking to BBC Radio Wales, Mr Drakeford said the new variant was more easily spread and stricter lockdown measures were now needed to keep people safe. Ministers are in talks with employers and unions and changes are set to be announced for workplaces - to protect workers - early next week. Mr Drakeford said he wanted to see the way supermarkets were policed return to the way they were during the first lockdown,with strict number limits in stores and social distancing measures abided to. But he said a curfew, meaning people would have to be in their homes by a certain time,similar to that seen in Northern Ireland, was not currently being considered. This video can not be played Parents and teachers say they want to know when schools will reopen in Wales Schools and colleges had already been told they would have toteach online until 18 January at the earliest, however this will now continue if cases of the virus do not fall ""materially"" before the next review date on 29 January. If cases do not drop, that would mean schools would reopen on 22 February at the earliest, and internal exams have also been cancelled. But teaching unions have warned that moreuniformed lateral flow testing needs to be in placeand teachers must be vaccinated before talks on how to reopen schools can begin. Speaking at the Welsh Government coronavirus briefing, Mr Drakeford said people working at special schools and school and college staff who were at risk would soon be vaccinated. Cardiff University has also confirmed that a phased return to in-person teaching has been cancelled, with learning continuing online for most students until 22 February. Students currently have to have hadtwo lateral flow tests confirming they are negative for Covid-19 before they return to Welsh campuses- and face to face teaching is only resuming for medical students and those who have practical parts of their courses on campus. Mr Drakeford said: ""Universities have worked hard to make sure that when students do return it is done in a careful and controlled way, with the safety of those young people and their communities at the forefront of their planning."" The announcement affecting showrooms means any retailers which allow people to browse and then order for a future date - such as kitchens, bathrooms, furniture and car sales - must close. Click and collect will still be allowed. Confirmingalert level four,externalrestrictions would continue for at least three more weeks, Mr Drakeford told Radio Wales the lockdown measures were already leading to cases falling, but the rate remained high. ""There are some positive signs that the huge collective effort we are making is making a difference, but the numbers are stubbornly high,"" he said. ""We have not yet seen an impact of those falls feeding into the number of people being admitted to hospital and becoming, sometimes, so ill they need intensive care. ""We need to see the numbers come down as well so that our NHS is genuinely able to cope with the enormous pressure it is currently facing."" Mr Drakeford said huge efforts were being made to rollout the Covid-19 vaccines, and with the ""end being in sight"" it was more important than ever for people to follow the rules and stay home. ""We have made so many sacrifices together and we mustn't stop now,"" he said. Schools in Wales closed early before the Christmas break and may not reopen until late February Schools and colleges are open for children of critical workers, as well as vulnerable learners and anyone who needs to complete essential exams or assessments All nurseries and childcare settings remain open Universities in Wales had already agreed a staggered start to term, but these are now being pushed back with learning continuing online Welsh university students studying in England should not return to campuses and will be taught online after a separatelockdownwas imposed Education Minister Kirsty Williams said: ""Schools and colleges have been safe and secure environments throughout the pandemic and that continues to be the case. ""However, the latestTAC,externalreport is clear on education's contribution. We know that school and college settings can contribute to wider social mixing outside the education environment and, right now, we all have to play our part in supressing this virus."" Ms Williams said the government would use the period until the next review date to ""look at all the possibilities for a phased and safe return of some pupils, such as those studying for qualifications, or the youngest children who find distance learning the most difficult"". Following the announcement, exams regulator Qualifications Wales cancelled the spring ""internal assessment window"" for GCSE, AS and A-level pupils, which was scheduled for 22 February - 23 April. This was introduced following the decision that exams would be cancelledin 2021. Chief executive Philip Blaker said: ""We know that learners need clarity about how they will be assessed and there will be clarity on revised arrangements soon."" Mr Drakeford said discussions were under way between teachers and education officials over ways children could catch up after missing time in school. This video can not be played This map shows the pattern of death rates involving Covid-19 by week since the pandemic began Speaking at Friday's Welsh Government coronavirus briefing, Mr Drakeford said police and local authorities would continue to crack down on people who break lockdown rules. Since the start of the pandemic, 3,585 fines have been handed out by police forces in Wales. ""Of course I want to thank everyone for following the rules and helping to keep Wales safe. It's always frustrating when a small minority act as though those rules do not apply to them,"" he added. ""I want everybody to know that where people knowingly and persistently break the rules, action will be taken. Too many lives have been lost to this awful virus to allow anybody to believe that they do not share in the responsibility that binds us all."" Unions welcomed the news saying the health and safety of pupils and staff ""had to be a priority"", but said teachers must now be given the vaccine as a priority, and pupils and staff must be protected before talks about reopening schools began. Currently teachers are not on the priority list for immunisation, and have to wait to get the jab dependent on their age and if they have a medical condition. When will I get the vaccine and what does it mean? Laura Doel, director of The National Association of Headteachers Cymru, said a ""properly organised"" testing regime needed to be put in place for schools, and special schools and pupil referral units needed support to remain open. ""Any plan that sees school staff return to face-to-face learning should be afforded as much protection as possible against the virus,"" she said.""Once these issues have been addressed, then we can discuss the orderly return to school we all want."" Meanwhile, Eithne Hughes, director of the Association of School and College Leaders Cymru said: ""I think we would be happier if we had clarity about what that date looks like, it would give confidence in the system."" Opposition parties called for clear plans on how schools would return and for support to make sure pupils from poorer backgrounds did not fall behind due to a ""digital divide"". Plaid Cymru's education spokeswoman Sian Gwenllian said: ""The Welsh Government must plan now for the gradual and safe reopening of schools, putting in place safety measures, and should lay out plans for a vaccination programme for schools staff."" Welsh Conservative education spokeswoman Suzy Davies called for the Welsh Government to publish evidence on its reasons for closing schools, bring forward vaccines for teachers, and that money must be made available for all pupils to access laptops for online learning. ""This is another bleak day for education in Wales,"" she said. ""Decisions aren't easy to make and I urge everyone involved in the journeys to and from school to consider how they might help schools open again and stay open.""

"Marks & Spencer says sales of sleepwear have soared as people spend more time at home because of Covid restrictions. The retailer sold 20% more women's pyjamas during the 13 weeks to 26 December, with many of them being bought as Christmas presents. ""The great British public are back in their pyjamas,"" said chief executive Steve Rowe. Despite this, clothing sales as a whole fell nearly a quarter, although food sales showed modest growth. M&S said its trading was ""robust"" over the Christmas period, but UK revenues for the quarter were Â£2.52bn, 8.2% lower than last year. M&S blamed ""on-off restrictions and distortions in demand patterns"" due to the coronavirus crisis. International revenues also took a big hit, falling 10.4%. M&S also said that potential post-Brexit tariffs on part of its range exported to the EU, together with ""very complex"" administrative processes, would ""significantly impact"" its businesses in Ireland and the Czech Republic, as well as its franchise business in France. Mr Rowe said the chain's popular Percy Pig sweets, made in Germany, were one product that could face tax rises. It said it was ""actively working to mitigate"" those effects. Sainsbury's festive boost despite smaller turkeys Champagne puts fizz in Morrisons' Christmas sales Mr Rowe thanked staff for ""a first-class execution of Christmas for our customers in near impossible conditions"". The High Street stalwart said customers had responded to its ""innovative seasonal product"" during the four-week run-up to Christmas. Like-for-like food sales had risen 2.6% during the period, it said. However, clothing and home sales fell by 24.1%, and UK sales overall were down 7.6% on a like-for-like basis. Trading was hit particularly badly in November by the national lockdown in England, with clothing and home sales slumping 40.5% in the month and food sales down 4.5%. ""Near-term trading remains very challenging, but we are continuing to accelerate change under our Never the Same Again programme to ensure the business emerges from the pandemic in very different shape,"" Mr Rowe said. On the positive side, M&S said its tie-up with online firm Ocado had produced ""very strong"" results, while customers had responded to its ""innovative seasonal product"" during the four-week run-up to Christmas. Ross Hindle, retail sector analyst at Third Bridge, said: ""Despite the pressure faced by their clothing division, the M&S food division is expected to deliver solid results, propelled by both stockpiling and its Ocado partnership. He pointed to reports that M&S was poised to acquire the Jaeger clothing brand as a possible way forward, saying it ""hints at the potential for a more aggressive shift into the multi-brand space"". ""M&S have numerous large stores which could be filled with non-M&S merchandise in order to drive their top-line. The risk here is whether such brands might cannibalise M&S branded products,"" he added. Emily Salter, retail analyst at GlobalData, said M&S was ""paying the cost for its inability to adapt fast enough to changing shopping habits"". ""M&S's recovery is slow versus other apparel players, as it continues to be hurt by an online platform unable to make up for lost store sales,"" she added. She saw little point in a potential purchase of Jaeger, as it would be ""costly to turn around and do little to boost the retailer's fortunes"". However, she said M&S's focus on value in food had ""started to pay off, with decent sales growth, especially considering dampened footfall on High Streets"".

"US President Donald Trump has less than two weeks left in office, but the Senate's top Democrat has called for his presidential powers to be removed immediately after his supporters violently stormed the US Capitol on Wednesday. ""What happened at the US Capitol yesterday was an insurrection against the United States, incited by the president. This president should not hold office one day longer,"" Senator Chuck Schumer said in a statement. He added that Mike Pence should invoke the 25th Amendment, which allows for a transfer of power from the president to the vice-president, either temporarily or permanently. ""If the vice-president and the cabinet refuse to stand up, Congress should reconvene to impeach the president,"" he said. Democrats of the House Judiciary Committee have also written a letter to Vice-President Pence urging him to act to remove Donald Trump from office, saying he had stoked an act of insurrection and ""sought to undermine our democracy"".

In pictures: Pro-Trump protesters storm Capitol 'They tried to break in - then I heard a shot' The 25th Amendment allows the vice-president to become acting president when a president is unable to continue his duties, if for example, he or she becomes incapacitated due to a physical or mental illness. The part of the amendment being discussed is section four, which allows the vice-president and a majority of the cabinet to declare President Trump unable to perform his duties. Vice-President Mike Pence (L) would take over as acting president if Donald Trump's powers are removed They would need to sign a letter to the speaker of the House of Representatives and the presiding officer of the Senate declaring the president is unfit to govern or incapable ""of discharging the powers and duties of his office"".  At this point, Vice-President Mike Pence would automatically take over. The president is given the chance to offer a written response, and if he contests the finding, then it falls on Congress to decide. Any vote in the Senate and House of Representatives ordering the president's removal requires a two-thirds majority. Until the issue is resolved, the vice-president would act as president. Nancy Pelosi introduced legislation based on the 25th Amendment after President Trump's Covid-19 diagnosis Discussions about invoking the 25th Amendment also arose after President Trump's Covid-19 diagnosis in October last year, amid concern he may be too sick to run the country. What happens when a US president is too sick to work? Around the same time, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi introduced legislation based on the 25th Amendment that created a commission to review a president's fitness for office. The 25th Amendment was ratified in 1967, four years after the assassination of John F Kennedy, and was intended to address questions of presidential succession if a president becomes incapacitated. Republican President Ronald Reagan transferred powers to his vice-president for eight hours in 1985 whilst having surgery for cancer And for this reason, a number of presidents have used the amendment - specifically section three - which allows them to temporarily hand over power to their vice-presidents. In 2002 and 2007, President George W Bush placed his vice-president in charge when he was sedated during routine colonoscopies. President Ronald Reagan did the same in 1985 when he was in hospital for cancer surgery. But to date, no sitting president has ever been permanently removed using the 25th Amendment. There have been calls for President Trump to be impeached for a second time. Minnesota Democratic Congresswoman Ilhan Omar announced she was drawing up articles of impeachment against him, with a growing number of fellow Democrats voicing their support. Allow Twitter content?

Donald Trump has already been impeached once - by the Democrat-led House in December 2019 over allegations he improperly sought help from Ukraine to boost his chances of re-election. He faced two charges - abuse of power and the obstruction of Congress - but was later acquitted by the Republican-led Senate. He is only the third US president in history to have been impeached. Trump impeachment: The short, medium and long story To impeach means to bring charges in Congress that will form the basis for a trial. The US constitution states a president ""shall be removed from office on impeachment for, and conviction of, treason, bribery, or other high crimes or misdemeanours"". It is a political process, rather than a criminal one. It happens in two stages - articles are brought to the House of Representatives where, if passed, they proceed to the Senate for a trial. But here, a two-thirds vote is necessary for a president's removal - and this milestone has never been reached in US history. If President Trump were replaced through the impeachment process, Vice-President Mike Pence would move into the Oval Office. No president has ever been impeached twice during his time in office. Questions remain as to whether there would be enough time to impeach Donald Trump before his term ends on 20 January, when President-elect Joe Biden is inaugurated.

"The UK's Covid vaccine campaign has shifted its focus to boosters - an attempt to reduce the impact of the Omicron variant. Almost seven in 10 of those aged 12 or over in the UK have had a booster, while nine in 10 have had a single jab and more than eight in 10 have had a second dose. But despite more than 38 million boosters, or third doses, being given so far, more people are being urged to come forward and jabs are being rolled out to all five to 11-year-olds. The vaccine rollout was launched in winter 2020 and began with those considered most vulnerable before later moving down the adult age groups. All those aged 12 and over are eligible for two full doses while all five to 11-year-olds are now being offered two low-dose jabs, at least 12 weeks apart. Booster jabs are also available to all over-16s, as well as children aged 12-15 in at-risk groups. The JCVI says a fourth Covid jab is not yet needed because data shows, three months after a booster shot, people aged 65 and over still haveabout 90% protection against hospitalisation. The UK has approved five vaccines for use: Pfizer-BioNTech, Oxford-AstraZeneca, Moderna, Janssen and Novavax; four of which require two doses for maximum protection. Those receiving boosters have so far been receiving one dose of Pfizer or half a dose of Moderna. So far, more than 52 million people have had a first vaccine dose - some 92% of over-12s.  More than 49 million - 85% of over-12s - have had both doses. While uptake of first and second doses dropped off late last year, there was a steep rise in people having boosters. However, booster numbers dipped over the Christmas holiday period and remain low. More than 38 million booster doses have been administered across the UK so far. Overall vaccination rates have now levelled off in every age group in England apart from the youngest bands. The aim of the vaccination programme is toprotect as many people as possible from serious illness,externalthrough developing the UK population's immunity against Covid-19. Data from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) suggests more thannine in 10 adults,externalin the UK now have coronavirus antibodies - which is evidence of a past Covid infection or having received at least one dose of a vaccine. However, this figure does not tell us how many people are protected from infection or how close we are to reaching herd immunity - the point at which everyone is protected, directly or indirectly, as a result of high immunity levels in the population. Will a vaccine give us our old lives back? Is Covid at risk of becoming a disease of the poor? Across the country, there continues to be some variation in the vaccine programme. Scotland has vaccinated 93% of those aged 12 and over with at least one dose, while England and Wales have hit 92% and Northern Ireland 89%. Second doses are also being rolled out, with all nations reaching more than 80% of over-12s so far. Across the English regions, the South West has vaccinated 87% of the same age group with at least one dose, while London has reached 70%. When looking at boosters, the South West has reached 68% of people aged 12 and over, while for London the figure is 46%. There have also been disparities between ethnic groups and poorer and wealthier areas. Analysis of NHS records by theOpenSAFELY group,external- a collaboration between Oxford University and the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine - shows that black people were the least likely to have received a booster vaccine. The study was based on more than 20 million patient records in England and covers people not living in care homes. Areas of London are under-represented in the data. In addition, booster take-up in poorer areas is lower than in more affluent areas. Currently, the Pfizer-BioNTech, Oxford-AstraZeneca, Moderna, Novavax and one-shot Janssen vaccines are approved for use throughout the UK. Others, such that produced by CureVac, have not yet been given the green light. The UK had ordered more than 540 million doses of seven of the most promising vaccines, including the four so far approved for use. In addition, the government has now signed deals to buy 114 million more doses of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines to use in 2022 and 2023. French vaccine maker Valneva said the UK government had scrapped a deal for 100m doses of its vaccine, which is yet to be approved. LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area?

"Marks & Spencer has temporarily stopped selling hundreds of items in its Northern Ireland stores due to Brexit red tape. The retailer said it feared its food would be blocked due to new rules governing shipments between Great Britain and Northern Ireland. A growing number of firms have spoken out about paperwork delays at ports. The government said traders and hauliers need to take steps to comply with new border rules. M&S took the decision to temporarily drop hundreds of products, including chocolate fudge pudding and sweet and sour chicken, from its Northern Ireland stores after it saw competitors' lorries barred from travelling between the mainland and Northern Ireland. An entire consignment in a lorry can be held up if only one item in the truck doesn't have the correct customs forms filled out. The retailer said it aimed to get the products back up for sale soon. An M&S spokesperson said: ""We have served customers in Northern Ireland for over 50 years and our priority is to make sure we continue to deliver the same choice and great quality range that our loyal customers have always enjoyed. ""Stores have been receiving regular deliveries this week, however following the UK's recent departure from the EU, we are transitioning to new processes and we're working closely with our partners and suppliers to ensure customers can continue to enjoy a great range of products."" In addition to problems shipping goods internally in the UK, the new Brexit trade rules are creating problems for exporters and traders transporting goods to and from the EU, say firms. The UK sealed a trade deal with the European Union (EU) on 24 December that was billed as preserving its zero-tariff and zero-quota access to the bloc's single market. But in addition to red tape causing delays, major retailers that use the UK as a distribution hub for European business could face possible tariffs if they re-export goods to the EU. On Friday, M&S chief executive Steve Rowe warned of more red tape and a rise in export costs to some countries. ""The best example I can give you of that is Percy Pig,"" he said, ""Percy Pig is actually manufactured in Germany. If it comes to the UK and we then send it to Ireland, in theory it would have some tax on it,"" he added. M&S said it was ""actively working to mitigate"" the effects of the ""rules of origin"" regulations, under which products are taxed differently depending on which country they come from. Other firms have also been hit by the confusion caused by new Brexit trading rules. Parcels giant DPD has suspended some services, while seafood exporter John Ross said the chaos was like being ""thrown in the cold Atlantic without a lifejacket"". Shane Brennan, chief executive of the Cold Chain Federation, which represents chilled transport and storage companies, said the emerging problems had come despite the amount of cross-border traffic still being quite low. ""Trade flows are still only about 50% of what we would expect, but even at those levels we are seeing levels of confusion and delays,"" he told the BBC's Today programme. ""The feeling is we are building to quite a significant potential disruption."" John Lewis scrapping overseas deliveries Were there hold-ups in first week after Brexit? Why are there empty shelves in some supermarkets? Covid tests for Channel hauliers to continue A government spokesman acknowledged that there had been ""some issues"", but said ministers had always been clear there would be some disruption at the end of the transition period. The Cabinet Office said in a statement that the volume of border crossings had been low so far this year, but that it expected crossings to steadily increase to normal levels. This brings the potential for ""significant disruption if traders and hauliers have not taken the necessary steps to comply with the new rules,"" the Cabinet Office said. Out of about 1,500 lorries per day trying to get from Great Britain to the EU in the new year, 700 have been turned away - mainly due to a lack of a negative Covid test for drivers, it said. ""We have always been clear there would be changes now that we are out of the customs union and single market, so full compliance with the new rules is vital to avoid disruption,"" said Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove. However, anger is growing among companies whose livelihoods depend on export trade. In a letter on Friday to Business Secretary Alok Sharma, Scottish salmon producer John Ross Jr launched a stinging attack on the government's handling of the situation. The firm's sales director, Victoria Leigh-Pearson, wrote that the company had in recent months ""had to endure the government issuing a barrage of useless information"" and an ""absence of factually correct information from all government agencies."" It amounted, she said, to ""gross incompetence"". John Ross exports to 36 countries and has won the Queen's Award twice Part of the letter to Alok Sharma: As I write, perishable goods that were dispatched from our facility five days ago, headed for France following a process that your department advised, have still not crossed the border. This usually takes only 24 hours because they are consolidated with the produce of other companies, which have not been able to follow the correct procedures due to a knowledge gap directly attributable to your department. Entire trucks are currently being rejected without explanation by the French customs authority. Our hauliers have now pulled their services as such a backlog has been created. Other hauliers are not taking on new customers. Today, we've even had confirmation that the IT systems of the UK and France are incompatible. After four years you only establish this now? Your so-called 'deal' is worthless if this situation is not fixed immediately, and unless you put in place measures to address the issues that continue to unfold on a daily basis. Moreover, as a seafood exporter, it feels as though our own government has thrown us into the cold Atlantic waters without a lifejacket. Yours sincerely, Victoria Leigh-Pearson, Sales Director, John Ross John Ross is not the only Scottish seafood exporter suffering. The industry says it has been hit by a ""perfect storm"" of Brexit disruption, which could sink a centuries-old industry. ""These businesses are not transporting toilet rolls or widgets. They are exporting the highest quality, perishable seafood which has a finite window to get to markets in peak condition,"" said Donna Fordyce, chief executive of Seafood Scotland. ""If the window closes, these consignments go to landfill."" She said the sector has already been weakened by Covid-19, the closure of the French border before Christmas as well as ""layer upon layer"" of problems associated with Brexit. The group fears that without exports, the fishing fleet will have little reason to go out. ""In a very short time, we could see the destruction of a centuries-old market which contributes significantly to the Scottish economy,"" added Ms Fordyce. UK government Minister for Scotland David Duguid blamed Scottish leaders for the issues. ""The Scottish Government has persistently refused to accept the democratic vote to leave the EU, but that does not allow them to abdicate their responsibilities to Scottish businesses,"" he said. ""Over the past 18 months they have assured the fishing industry that the systems they were putting in place would be adequate. They clearly are not."" Parcel delivery service DPD UK said it had paused its European Road Service because of the '""increased burden"" of customs paperwork for packages heading to the EU, including the Republic of Ireland. DPD said 20% of parcels had ""incorrect or incomplete data attached"", which meant they would have to be returned. This video can not be played What Brexit means for Britons travelling, shopping, studying or owning properties in the EU. In an email to its business customers, the company said that it had been a ""challenging few days"" for its international operation, and that it would ""pause and review"" its service.  It plans to restart on 13 January. ""It has now become evident that we have an increased burden with the new, more complex processes, and additional customs data we require from you for your parcels destined to Europe"" the firm wrote. The boss of one of Wales' largest hauliers said logistical problems have emerged at the Irish border too. Andrew Kinsella, managing director of Gwynedd Shipping, said his company has a backlog of 60 lorries waiting to be shipped to Dublin. He said many hauliers are finding that their customers are not able to generate the special declarations that are needed to ultimately enable a lorry to get onto a ferry. ""Whilst you don't see queues at ports and terminals the reality is that these queues are developing elsewhere in our depot in Holyhead, in our depot in Deeside and in our depot in Newport in South Wales, and lots of hauliers have depots in the proximity of ports,"" he said. ""There are a lot of issues about demarcation about who is going to arrange the export declaration with the UK revenue authorities, who's going to arrange the import declaration, the hauliers then trying to arrange the import safety and security declaration to create an ENS number which helps you generate a PBN number so there has been a lot of everyone finding their feet"".

"Marion Ramsey will be remembered by fans for her notable role in the US comedy series Police Academy Marion Ramsey, best known for her acting in the American film series Police Academy, has died at the age of 73, her agent has announced. Her management at Roger Paul Inc told the BBC she died at her Los Angeles home on Thursday morning. The agency said Ramsey had recently fallen ill, but did not give a cause of death. Ramsey was adored by fans for her portrayal of the squeaky-voiced Officer Laverne Hooks in Police Academy. She also had an illustrious career on Broadway, starring in the 1978 production Eubie!, a biographical musical about celebrated jazz pianist Eubie Blake. ""Her passion for performing and sharing her heart with the world was immense,"" Roger Paul Inc said in a statement. ""Marion carried with her a kindness and permeating light that instantly filled a room upon her arrival. ""The dimming of her light is already felt by those who knew her well. We will miss her, and always love her."" Ramsey featured in six Police Academy films as Officer Laverne Hooks Born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania in 1947, Ramsey started her career in the theatre, appearing in both the original Broadway and subsequent touring productions of Hello, Dolly!. She was prolific on Broadway, co-starring in many shows, including Harold Prince's Grind with Ben Vereen, and Eubie! with Gregory and Maurice Hines. Her agent said Ramsey was ""particularly proud"" about Broadway's Dreamgirls finally becoming a major motion picture in 2006, because she was one of the singers that the original Broadway show's producer, Tom Eyen, based the three main characters on. Ramsey's career in TV and film career took off after she appeared as a guest on the hit sitcom The Jeffersons in 1976. Following that, she was a regular on Cos, Bill Cosby's sketch show. She starred in six Police Academy films in total, making her a familiar face to fans of the franchise. Ramsey's agent said she had an immense passion for performing American actor Michael Winslow wrote in a tweet,externalthat he had ""no words to say or explain the pain"" of losing Ramsey. ""In the 80s the Police Academy films cast a long shadow over the comedy genre - they were everywhere & everyone watched them,""British producer Jonathan Sothcott wrote,external. ""#MarionRamsey was hilarious as Hooks - a fine comedic actress.""

Thank you for reading. The team was Alex Therrien, Mary O'Connor, Alexandra Fouche, Kevin Ponniah, Max Matza, Owen Amos, and James Clarke. We're pausing our live coverage of the coronavirus pandemic for today. It's been a busy day in the UK - here's a roundup of the day's top headlines: Richmond upon Thames was the one area in England not to see a rise in cases All but one of England's 315 local areas have seen a recent rise in coronavirus case rates, figures released today show. Richmond upon Thames, in south-west London, was the one exception, with a fall in infections. The figures, for the seven days to 4 January, are based on tests carried out in laboratories (pillar one of the government's testing programme) and in the wider community (pillar two). Barking & Dagenham in London continues to have the highest rate in England, with 1,687.1 cases per 100,000 people - up from 1,150.3 in the seven days to 28 December. Redbridge, also in London, has the second highest rate, up from 1,166.4 to 1,559.2. Thurrock in Essex has the third highest rate, up from 1,252.1 to 1,540.1. Richmond upon Thames has 629.7 - down from 639.3.

Among them are the FA Cup third round clash between Southampton and Shrewsbury and rugby union's Premiership game between Northampton Saints and Leicester Tigers - both of which were due to take place on Saturday. Other sides will field reserve or youth teams after their first team were forced to isolate. You can check the full list of affected fixtures, which the BBC will update,here. Meanwhile,Newcastle boss Steve Bruce has said it is ""morally wrong"" for football to continueamid increasing coronavirus outbreaks at clubs. The Magpies were the first team to have a Premier League match postponed this season, but more than 60 games in England have been called off. ""Financially it's right to play on, but for me, morally, it's probably wrong,"" said Bruce. ""I understand people want to see a game of football but we are just as vulnerable as everybody else.""

So once again, I must urge everyone to stay at home, protect the NHS and save lives.â Kevin PeacheyPersonal finance reporter England's eviction ban has been extended for six weeks, following a similar move in Scotland on Thursday. The move will mean eviction notices - which could have started again on Monday - will not be served on tenants during lockdown. It follows calls from charities for more financial support for tenants. Councils are also being given extra funding to house rough sleepers during the cold winter months. They will be asked to go back to people on the streets who had previously refused help, given the rising Covid infection rates. Evictions were banned at the start of the first lockdown in March - and the UK government has also extended the notice period landlords must give from three to six months.

As we just reported, police and local leaders in Cumbria are urging people not to visit the Lake District this weekend. In Surrey, the council says an advertising van will tour busy areas, warning people to stick to the rules. In recent days the car parks at places including Box Hill, popular with walkers and cyclists, have been overcrowded.

It read: ""Whilst it may be tempting to go out for a scenic drive in the Lake District, now is the time to stay home, look after one another and play your part to make sure that Cumbria is ready for the return of visitors when it is safe to do so."" Maddy SavageBBC News, Stockholm Unlike many European leaders, Prime Minister Stefan LÃ¶fven has so far decided against a national lockdown As we reported at 12:01 GMT, Swedenâs parliament has agreed a new pandemic law allowing ministers to introduce stricter measures in the country. Within hours of the law being passed, Prime
Minister Stefan LÃ¶fven announced plans to limit numbers in gyms,
swimming pools and shops in relation to how big they are. Managers will need to
make sure thereâs at least 10 square metres available per person. The Social
Democrat leader also says there will be a ban of more than eight people at
bookable private party venues - from dining halls to common rooms in apartment
blocks. There is already a ban on holding public events for more than eight
people, such as concerts, plays or demonstrations. The law comes into force on
Sunday. Those who break new rules emerging from the legislation will face a
fine - with businesses told they may also be forced to close. Philippa RoxbyHealth reporter, BBC News The number of deaths with Covid-19 reported for the UK today has hita new high of 1,325. Even in the first peak of the pandemic, the daily record was 1,224 (on 21 April). It is a sad and sobering figure â and the grim truth is that the next few weeks are likely to see even more people dying and that figure rising further. That is because cases are continuing to rise, which means hospitals will fill up with more Covid patients, leading to the most seriously ill dying in several weeksâ time. It is an unstoppable trend. Of course, not all those 1,325 deaths happened today. This figure includes deaths that happened mostly over the past few days â but some will have occurred even earlier and a few before Christmas, and will only have been reported today. This lag in recording and reporting deaths over Christmas is why the deaths figures in the past three days have been over 1,000. A more even spread of deaths occurring every day is likely to be seen when we look back at the figures in several weeksâ time. But it doesnât take away from the fact that nearly 80,000 people have now died with Covid-19 in the UK. Alice EvansBBC News Fashion student Mhari Thurston-Tyler posted an advert for the ""crop top"" (right) on Depop after she says she found some discarded Chiltern Railways seat covers (like those on the left) A fashion student is being warned not to sell prohibited items on the clothes app Depop after she posted an advert for a top made from a train seat cover. Mhari Thurston-Tyler made the bandeau out of a Chiltern Railways seat cover designed to promote social distancing during the coronavirus pandemic. The 20-year-old sold the top for Â£15 but later refunded her customer and took the advert down. Depop says the item ""clearly violates our terms of service"". Chiltern Railways says it has been using the social distancing ""seat sashes"" since the beginning of the UK's Covid epidemic.

Organization says there is a ""clear problem"" of poorer countries not receiving supplies of
Covid-19 vaccines. ""Rich countries have the majority of the supply,"" Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus tells reporters in Geneva. He urges countries and manufacturers to
stop making bilateral deals at the expense of the Covax vaccine-sharing scheme. That scheme aims,external""to ensure that people in all corners of the world will get access to vaccines once they are available, regardless of their wealth"". As these graphics show, wealthier countries have made the quickest start on vaccinations - although not all countries are reporting data. Earlier this afternoon, the UK reported 1,325 coronavirus deaths within 28 days of a positive test - the highest daily figure of the pandemic. But Dr William Welfare, director for the Covid-19 response at Public Health England, says the daily death toll is likely to continue to rise. He says: âEach life lost to this virus is a tragedy, but sadly we can expect the death toll to continue to rise until we stop the spread. âApproximately one-in-three people who have coronavirus have no symptoms and could be spreading it without realising it. âTo protect our loved ones it is essential we all stay at home where possible. This will reduce new infections, ease the pressure on the NHS and save lives.â  Some Canadian snowbirds - retired people who travel south for the winter - are finding they are able to get vaccinations in Florida earlier than they could if they remained at home. Florida is allowing anyone over the age of 65 to be vaccinated for no charge. That includes non-citizens. Canada is prioritising health workers and people living in group homes. Getting a vaccine there is like winning the lottery, one coupletell CBC News,external. They say they were able to book vaccinations for other Canadian friends, who are now planning to travel to Florida for the jab after initially postponing their trip due to lack of vaccination. As we reported earlier this hour, the UK today reported a record number of coronavirus deaths and cases - 1,325 and 68,053 respectively. In the below graphics we explore the trends behind the numbers. This video can not be played As we've been reporting, London Mayor Sadiq Khan has declared a ""major incident"" as coronavirus threatens to overwhelm the capital's hospitals. Major incidents have previously been called for the Grenfell Tower fire in June 2017 and the terror attacks at Westminster Bridge and London Bridge. Mr Khan said: ""Unless the virus reduces... we could run out of beds."" A major incident is defined as being âbeyond the scope of business-as-usual operations, and is likely to involve serious harm, damage, disruption or risk to human life or welfare, essential services, the environment or national securityâ, according tothe mayor's statement.,external Julie Hambleton said she was issued with the penalty notice on 20 December, after the event a month earlier Campaigners attending a memorial to the Birmingham pub bombings have been issued with fixed penalty notices for breaching coronavirus restrictions. Six people, including Julie Hambleton, whose sister Maxine was killed in the 1974 attack, were given the fine over a memorial event on 21 November, the anniversary of the blasts that killed 21 people. Lawyers acting for the six say the notices will be challenged. The notices relate to a breach of regulations over the gathering of two or more in a public place, police say.

He calls the Moderna vaccine ""another weapon in our armoury"" against coronavirus. He says the UK government is aiming to offer a jab to ""between 14 and 15 million"" people by mid-February, who make up the four top priority groups - including theover-70s, the clinically extremely vulnerable, care home residents, and frontline health and social care workers. Zahawi adds he now has ""a much clearer line of sight"" in terms of the NHS's plan for the vaccination programme rollout and is confident the government can meet its targets. He says teachers will be ""top of the list"" in terms of phase two of the programme, as will be ""many other key workers"". Â© 2025 BBC.

"The UK's Covid vaccine campaign has shifted its focus to boosters - an attempt to reduce the impact of the Omicron variant. Almost seven in 10 of those aged 12 or over in the UK have had a booster, while nine in 10 have had a single jab and more than eight in 10 have had a second dose. But despite more than 38 million boosters, or third doses, being given so far, more people are being urged to come forward and jabs are being rolled out to all five to 11-year-olds. The vaccine rollout was launched in winter 2020 and began with those considered most vulnerable before later moving down the adult age groups. All those aged 12 and over are eligible for two full doses while all five to 11-year-olds are now being offered two low-dose jabs, at least 12 weeks apart. Booster jabs are also available to all over-16s, as well as children aged 12-15 in at-risk groups. The JCVI says a fourth Covid jab is not yet needed because data shows, three months after a booster shot, people aged 65 and over still haveabout 90% protection against hospitalisation. The UK has approved five vaccines for use: Pfizer-BioNTech, Oxford-AstraZeneca, Moderna, Janssen and Novavax; four of which require two doses for maximum protection. Those receiving boosters have so far been receiving one dose of Pfizer or half a dose of Moderna. So far, more than 52 million people have had a first vaccine dose - some 92% of over-12s.  More than 49 million - 85% of over-12s - have had both doses. While uptake of first and second doses dropped off late last year, there was a steep rise in people having boosters. However, booster numbers dipped over the Christmas holiday period and remain low. More than 38 million booster doses have been administered across the UK so far. Overall vaccination rates have now levelled off in every age group in England apart from the youngest bands. The aim of the vaccination programme is toprotect as many people as possible from serious illness,externalthrough developing the UK population's immunity against Covid-19. Data from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) suggests more thannine in 10 adults,externalin the UK now have coronavirus antibodies - which is evidence of a past Covid infection or having received at least one dose of a vaccine. However, this figure does not tell us how many people are protected from infection or how close we are to reaching herd immunity - the point at which everyone is protected, directly or indirectly, as a result of high immunity levels in the population. Will a vaccine give us our old lives back? Is Covid at risk of becoming a disease of the poor? Across the country, there continues to be some variation in the vaccine programme. Scotland has vaccinated 93% of those aged 12 and over with at least one dose, while England and Wales have hit 92% and Northern Ireland 89%. Second doses are also being rolled out, with all nations reaching more than 80% of over-12s so far. Across the English regions, the South West has vaccinated 87% of the same age group with at least one dose, while London has reached 70%. When looking at boosters, the South West has reached 68% of people aged 12 and over, while for London the figure is 46%. There have also been disparities between ethnic groups and poorer and wealthier areas. Analysis of NHS records by theOpenSAFELY group,external- a collaboration between Oxford University and the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine - shows that black people were the least likely to have received a booster vaccine. The study was based on more than 20 million patient records in England and covers people not living in care homes. Areas of London are under-represented in the data. In addition, booster take-up in poorer areas is lower than in more affluent areas. Currently, the Pfizer-BioNTech, Oxford-AstraZeneca, Moderna, Novavax and one-shot Janssen vaccines are approved for use throughout the UK. Others, such that produced by CureVac, have not yet been given the green light. The UK had ordered more than 540 million doses of seven of the most promising vaccines, including the four so far approved for use. In addition, the government has now signed deals to buy 114 million more doses of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines to use in 2022 and 2023. French vaccine maker Valneva said the UK government had scrapped a deal for 100m doses of its vaccine, which is yet to be approved. LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area?

"Marks & Spencer says sales of sleepwear have soared as people spend more time at home because of Covid restrictions. The retailer sold 20% more women's pyjamas during the 13 weeks to 26 December, with many of them being bought as Christmas presents. ""The great British public are back in their pyjamas,"" said chief executive Steve Rowe. Despite this, clothing sales as a whole fell nearly a quarter, although food sales showed modest growth. M&S said its trading was ""robust"" over the Christmas period, but UK revenues for the quarter were Â£2.52bn, 8.2% lower than last year. M&S blamed ""on-off restrictions and distortions in demand patterns"" due to the coronavirus crisis. International revenues also took a big hit, falling 10.4%. M&S also said that potential post-Brexit tariffs on part of its range exported to the EU, together with ""very complex"" administrative processes, would ""significantly impact"" its businesses in Ireland and the Czech Republic, as well as its franchise business in France. Mr Rowe said the chain's popular Percy Pig sweets, made in Germany, were one product that could face tax rises. It said it was ""actively working to mitigate"" those effects. Sainsbury's festive boost despite smaller turkeys Champagne puts fizz in Morrisons' Christmas sales Mr Rowe thanked staff for ""a first-class execution of Christmas for our customers in near impossible conditions"". The High Street stalwart said customers had responded to its ""innovative seasonal product"" during the four-week run-up to Christmas. Like-for-like food sales had risen 2.6% during the period, it said. However, clothing and home sales fell by 24.1%, and UK sales overall were down 7.6% on a like-for-like basis. Trading was hit particularly badly in November by the national lockdown in England, with clothing and home sales slumping 40.5% in the month and food sales down 4.5%. ""Near-term trading remains very challenging, but we are continuing to accelerate change under our Never the Same Again programme to ensure the business emerges from the pandemic in very different shape,"" Mr Rowe said. On the positive side, M&S said its tie-up with online firm Ocado had produced ""very strong"" results, while customers had responded to its ""innovative seasonal product"" during the four-week run-up to Christmas. Ross Hindle, retail sector analyst at Third Bridge, said: ""Despite the pressure faced by their clothing division, the M&S food division is expected to deliver solid results, propelled by both stockpiling and its Ocado partnership. He pointed to reports that M&S was poised to acquire the Jaeger clothing brand as a possible way forward, saying it ""hints at the potential for a more aggressive shift into the multi-brand space"". ""M&S have numerous large stores which could be filled with non-M&S merchandise in order to drive their top-line. The risk here is whether such brands might cannibalise M&S branded products,"" he added. Emily Salter, retail analyst at GlobalData, said M&S was ""paying the cost for its inability to adapt fast enough to changing shopping habits"". ""M&S's recovery is slow versus other apparel players, as it continues to be hurt by an online platform unable to make up for lost store sales,"" she added. She saw little point in a potential purchase of Jaeger, as it would be ""costly to turn around and do little to boost the retailer's fortunes"". However, she said M&S's focus on value in food had ""started to pay off, with decent sales growth, especially considering dampened footfall on High Streets"".

Maddy SavageBBC News, Stockholm Unlike many European leaders, Prime Minister Stefan LÃ¶fven has so far decided against a national lockdown As we reported at 12:01 GMT, Swedenâs parliament has agreed a new pandemic law allowing ministers to introduce stricter measures in the country. Within hours of the law being passed, Prime
Minister Stefan LÃ¶fven announced plans to limit numbers in gyms,
swimming pools and shops in relation to how big they are. Managers will need to
make sure thereâs at least 10 square metres available per person. The Social
Democrat leader also says there will be a ban of more than eight people at
bookable private party venues - from dining halls to common rooms in apartment
blocks. There is already a ban on holding public events for more than eight
people, such as concerts, plays or demonstrations. The law comes into force on
Sunday. Those who break new rules emerging from the legislation will face a
fine - with businesses told they may also be forced to close. Philippa RoxbyHealth reporter, BBC News The number of deaths with Covid-19 reported for the UK today has hita new high of 1,325. Even in the first peak of the pandemic, the daily record was 1,224 (on 21 April). It is a sad and sobering figure â and the grim truth is that the next few weeks are likely to see even more people dying and that figure rising further. That is because cases are continuing to rise, which means hospitals will fill up with more Covid patients, leading to the most seriously ill dying in several weeksâ time. It is an unstoppable trend. Of course, not all those 1,325 deaths happened today. This figure includes deaths that happened mostly over the past few days â but some will have occurred even earlier and a few before Christmas, and will only have been reported today. This lag in recording and reporting deaths over Christmas is why the deaths figures in the past three days have been over 1,000. A more even spread of deaths occurring every day is likely to be seen when we look back at the figures in several weeksâ time. But it doesnât take away from the fact that nearly 80,000 people have now died with Covid-19 in the UK.

Organization says there is a ""clear problem"" of poorer countries not receiving supplies of
Covid-19 vaccines. ""Rich countries have the majority of the supply,"" Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus tells reporters in Geneva. He urges countries and manufacturers to
stop making bilateral deals at the expense of the Covax vaccine-sharing scheme. That scheme aims,external""to ensure that people in all corners of the world will get access to vaccines once they are available, regardless of their wealth"". As these graphics show, wealthier countries have made the quickest start on vaccinations - although not all countries are reporting data. Earlier this afternoon, the UK reported 1,325 coronavirus deaths within 28 days of a positive test - the highest daily figure of the pandemic. But Dr William Welfare, director for the Covid-19 response at Public Health England, says the daily death toll is likely to continue to rise. He says: âEach life lost to this virus is a tragedy, but sadly we can expect the death toll to continue to rise until we stop the spread. âApproximately one-in-three people who have coronavirus have no symptoms and could be spreading it without realising it. âTo protect our loved ones it is essential we all stay at home where possible. This will reduce new infections, ease the pressure on the NHS and save lives.â  Some Canadian snowbirds - retired people who travel south for the winter - are finding they are able to get vaccinations in Florida earlier than they could if they remained at home. Florida is allowing anyone over the age of 65 to be vaccinated for no charge. That includes non-citizens. Canada is prioritising health workers and people living in group homes. Getting a vaccine there is like winning the lottery, one coupletell CBC News,external. They say they were able to book vaccinations for other Canadian friends, who are now planning to travel to Florida for the jab after initially postponing their trip due to lack of vaccination.

"Police have issued CCTV footage of a man they want to speak to in connection with the incident A fraudster claiming to work for the NHS injected a 92-year-old woman with a fake Covid-19 vaccine, City of London Police has said. Detectives are hunting the man who charged the victim in Surbiton, south-west London, Â£160. Police said it was ""crucial"" he was caught as soon as possible as he ""may endanger people's lives"". Det Insp Kevin Ives described it as a ""disgusting and totally unacceptable assault"". It comes after the NHS warned people that no-one should be turning up at doorsteps offering a vaccine for payment,following a spate of fake text messages. Under the current coronavirus vaccine rollout plans, people will be invited to receive the vaccine by their GP or healthcare provider. Police said the victim allowed the man into her home on the afternoon of 30 December after he said he was from the NHS and there to administer the Covid-19 vaccine. She said she was jabbed in the arm with a ""dart-like implement"" before being charged Â£160, which the man said would be refunded by the NHS. Everything you need to know about the Covid vaccine in the UK Police said it was not known what substance, if any, was administered, but the woman had been checked at her local hospital and showed no ill effects. Det Insp Ives appealed for information to help identify the suspect. He added: ""It is crucial we catch him as soon as possible as not only is he defrauding individuals of money, he may endanger people's lives."" The man made a second visit to the woman's home on 4 January, when he asked for another Â£100, police said. The man was spotted in the Tolworth area of Kingston-upon-Thames on 4 January Officers released CCTV footage on Friday of a man dressed in a navy blue tracksuit with white stripes down the side, who they want to speak to in connection with the incident. He is described as a white man in his early 30s, who is about 5ft 9ins (1.75m) tall, of medium build, with light brown hair that is combed back. He speaks with a London accent. A spokesman for the Department of Health said: ""NHS England will never ask for bank details, Pin numbers or passwords, when contacting you about a vaccination.

"Demand for staff picked up in December for the first time in three months, new research by UK recruiters suggests. The spike was mostly due to temporary vacancies, said the Recruitment and Employment Confederation (REC) and financial services firm KPMG. Firms are looking to take on more temporary staff due to uncertainty over the Covid crisis and Brexit, they said. Permanent jobs saw a small uplift, according to data from 400 recruitment and employment consultancies. Although temporary vacancies rose at their fastest rate in more than two years, the increase in permanent roles marked the first boost seen since September. Neil Carberry, chief executive of the REC, said that starting pay rates also increased last month, with employers encouraged by positive news around the coronavirus vaccine rollout. ""The important thing now is to maintain as much of that momentum as possible through the new lockdown,"" he said.

"The Pfizer-BioNtech vaccine started being rolled out in the UK last month People who have had Covid vaccines are being warned to still take care. Vaccination has been shown to prevent severe infection, so even if people do catch the virus, they would be protected from getting seriously ill. The call comes as an NHS nurse working for the Hywel Dda University Health Board area said she contracted Covid-19 while waiting for her second dose. The health board said while the vaccine ""reduces your chance of suffering"", ""no vaccine is 100% effective"". The Pfizer-BioNtech vaccine, which started being rolled out in the UK last month, offersup to 95% protection against Covid-19 after a second dose. On Friday, the First Minister advised people receiving the vaccine to ""continue to act in a precautionary way"". Mark Drakeford said those people should ""recognise the new protection that they have"" but ""recognise as well that for many weeks, and for some months ahead, coronavirus is going to continue to be a feature of all our lives"". The hospital nurse, who works in the Hywel Dda University Health Board area in west Wales, said she felt ""angry and heartbroken"" about catching Covid at this stage. The nurse, who has asked not to be identified, said she was initially relieved to be offered the chance of a vaccine and despite difficulties getting an appointment, she said she received her first dose of the Pfizer-BioNtech vaccine last month. ""It gave me peace of mind. It made me feel safer and that I was doing the right thing for my family... but it gives a false sense of security,"" she said. The nurse said she was told it would take 10 days for the vaccine to offer some protection and reduce the risk of transmission. However, three weeks after the jab, she said she began to feel unwell - with ""quite severe symptoms"" of a bad cough, high temperature and breathlessness - and said she was ""shocked"" when she tested positive for coronavirus. Q&A: When will I get the Covid-19 vaccines? Wales lags behind England as 50,000 vaccinated She said her partner and one of her children also tested positive. The first vaccination rollout - the Pfizer vaccine -began on 8 December last year. Two doses are needed and to date around a million people have already received the first dose. The original advice - in Wales and the rest of the UK - was that people would need the second dose of the Pfizer vaccine three weeks after the first injection. But that changed last month to 12 weeks between doses on the advice of the UK's chief medical officers. The World Health Organisation does not recommend following the UK's decision, but has ""made a provision for countries in exceptional circumstances of vaccine supply constraints and epidemiological settings"" to delay the second dose for a few weeks to maximise the number of people getting a first dose. Pfizer said it has tested the vaccine's efficacy only when the two doses were given up to 21 days apart. The British Medical Association Cymru Wales has previously expressed concern about the length of time between doses. Doctors' union, BMA Cymru Wales, said there was a lack of evidence to support waiting 12 weeks for a second vaccine dose. Chair Dr David Bailey said: ""Our families don't choose to be exposed to a much higher dose of Covid, so we feel it's right that we should be protecting health workers and their families."" Hywel Dda health board said it had already vaccinated more than 10,000 high-risk people, including frontline NHS staff. Deputy Chief Executive Dr Philip Kloer, said: ""It is always distressing to hear about staff contracting the virus. Whilst the vaccine reduces your chance of suffering from Covid-19, no vaccine is 100% effective. ""There is particular risk that you may have contracted Covid-19 immediately prior to having the vaccine without knowing it, or that you may contract it in the week or two following vaccination as your body builds up protection. ""We have communicated the UK policy and assurances on second doses to our staff and assured them they will receive their second dose within 12 weeks of the first."" He added: ""Working within the NHS at the moment is very challenging and we acknowledge how difficult this is. ""Staff have worked tirelessly and made many sacrifices on behalf of caring for our communities and we are extremely grateful. We have put in place additional support and counselling and psychological support services."" Q&A: When will I get my Covid-19 vaccine?

"An image sent to BBC News Indonesia shows Ba'asyir (second from the right) in a vehicle with his family after being released early on Friday A radical Muslim cleric linked to the 2002 Bali bombings has been freed amid concerns over his ongoing influence on extremists. Abu Bakar Ba'asyir was picked up by his family from a jail outside Indonesia's capital Jakarta early on Friday. The 82-year-old is the former head of Jemaah Islamiah, an al-Qaeda-inspired group behind the attack that killed 202 people. Authorities say he will enter a deradicalisation programme. People from 21 nations died in the blasts on 12 October 2002 on the popular holiday island of Bali. The two bombs had ripped through Paddy's Irish Bar and the nearby Sari Club in the Kuta tourist district. Profile:The radical cleric linked to Bali bombings The 12 October 2002 Bali bombing plot It remains to this day Indonesia's deadliest terrorist attack. The release has drawn mixed reactions in Indonesia as well as Australia, where most of the victims were from. Australia's Prime Minister Scott Morrison said it was ""distressing"" for victims' families and that ""it's sometimes not a fair world"". The firebrand preacher was freed after completing a jail term for a conviction unrelated to the bombings. He had been sentenced to 15 years in jail in 2011 for supporting militant training in conservative Aceh province, but the term was later cut due to sentence reductions. Officials reportedly said he had ""served his punishment well"". Previously Ba'asyir had been jailed in 2005 for conspiracy over the Bali bombings, but this conviction was overturned on appeal. He has always denied any involvement in terrorism. Ba'asyir was commander of Jemaah Islamiah (JI), the militant Islamist group, at the time of the Bali bombings. Some described the cleric as the ""mastermind"" behind the blasts but his exact role remains unclear. Sidney Jones, director of the Institute for Policy Analysis of Conflict in Jakarta, said operational decisions were headed by someone else in JI but Ba'asyir would have given a ""de-facto green light"". ""He didn't plan it. But he is the person who could have stopped it if he said no."" Ba'asyir later broke off with JI, going on to found another extremist group, Jamaah Anshorut Tauhid. Ahead of the cleric's release Garil Arnandha, whose father was among the bombing victims, told the BBC: ""I don't agree with Abu Bakar Ba'asyir being released because in my opinion he is still very dangerous and has the potential to revive terrorism in Indonesia."" Endang, his mother, had a different view. ""As a bomb victim I have forgiven him,"" she told the BBC. ""He has served time in jail for his crimes and I really hope he will return to the right path. I am worried but I am trying to have positive thinking because the trauma of losing my husband in the bombing has been horrific."" This video can not be played Garil Arnandha, whose father died in the Bali bombings in 2002, met Ali Imron who is serving a life sentence for the attack In Australia, Prime Minister Scott Morrison said Ba'asyir's release was ""very distressing"" for relatives of those killed, but added it was ""a matter for the Indonesian justice system"". ""That doesn't make it any easier for any Australian to accept that, ultimately. That those who are responsible for the murder of Australians would now be free,"" he said. Eighty-eight Australians were among those who died in Bali. Bali marks deadly bomb attacks The bomb maker turned peacemaker Albert Talarico, a spokesman for the Coogee Dolphins rugby league club in Sydney that lost six members in the nightclub bombings, said it was ""very frustrating for the families"" who had to ""live through the same painful memories again"". ""I don't believe he should be released, but that's their rules,"" added Mr Talarico, speaking to the BBC earlier this week. ""It doesn't seem to be fair to the families."" The jerseys of the Coogee Dolphins club members who died were displayed at a memorial service in 2002 The club honours the six members who lost their lives each day - through the Coogee Dolphins emblem that was changed to reflect their position numbers, and during matches when these numbers are proudly displayed on the team jerseys. ""We carry their numbers on our chests in every match. They were young men in the prime of their lives. We make sure their stories are not forgotten,"" Mr Talarico said. Dr Jones told the BBC she didn't think Ba'asyir's release would have a major impact on the risk of violence in Indonesia. ""I think he will be treated as an elder statesman by conservative Muslim groups that would like to see greater Islamic law in Indonesia. But I don't think he is likely to inspire a new round of violent extremism,"" she said. That's partly down to his waning influence but also the change in how extremists operate today, she added. ""We're seeing less influence of individual clerics and more inspiration and instruction taken from the internet,"" Dr Jones explained. ""We're also seeing the proliferation of very small autonomous cells, not large hierarchical organisations that look to a single leader."" The preacher has always denied any involvement in terrorism After the Bali attacks, Indonesia - backed by Australia and the United States - set up an elite anti-terrorist unit that weakened JI. In 2008 three men were executed for their role in the bombings, and several others have either been jailed or killed by the security forces. Ba'asyir is reported to have pledged allegiance to the Islamic State in 2014 while in jail. The head of Indonesia's anti-terrorism agency Eddy Hartono has said the octogenarian would undergo a deradicalisation programme. ""We're hoping Abu Bakar Bashir after he's free can give peaceful, soothing preachings,"" he said in a statement, according to Reuters news agency. Additional reporting by BBC News Indonesia.

She added: ""We know this is a difficult time for people and through our Plan for Jobs we're continuing to support jobseekers to get skills for new sectors and find the work that is out there.""

"This video can not be played Trump calls for an 'orderly transition of power' to the Biden administration on January 20th A US Capitol police officer has died from injuries sustained in the attack on Congress by a pro-Trump mob as top Democrats have called for the president to be removed for ""inciting"" the riot. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi urged Vice-President Mike Pence to invoke the 25th amendment to the Constitution to declare the president unfit for office. Alternatively, she vowed to initiate the process to impeach the president. Under pressure, Donald Trump finally condemned the ""heinous attack"". Wednesday's violence came hours after Mr Trump encouraged his supporters to fight against the election results as Congress was certifying President-elect Joe Biden's victory in the November vote. Five people have died in relation to the riot, including Brian Sicknick, an officer at the US Capitol Police (USCP) who was ""injured while physically engaging with protesters"", the police said. Americans 'shocked' and 'disgusted' by riots A visual guide to the Congress riots The US Air Force veteran who lost her life in riots Meanwhile, the top congressional Democrats - Speaker Pelosi and Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer - have urged Vice-President Pence and Mr Trump's cabinet to remove the president for ""his incitement of insurrection"". ""The President's dangerous and seditious acts necessitate his immediate removal from office,"" they said in a joint statement. The duo called forMr Trump to be ousted using the 25th Amendment, which allows the vice-president to step up if the president is unable to perform his duties owing to a mental or physical illness. But it would require Mr Pence and at least eight cabinet members to break with Mr Trump and invoke the amendment, something they have so far seemed unlikely to do. Mr Trump is due to leave office on 20 January, when Mr Biden will be sworn in. This video can not be played Phone footage reveals chaotic scenes inside US Capitol Mrs Pelosi indicated that if the vice-president failed to act, she would convene the House to launch their second impeachment proceedings against Mr Trump. However, to succeed in convicting and removing the president, Democrats would need a two-thirds majority in the Senate, and there is no indication they would get those numbers. And it was not clear whether enough time remained to carry out the process. Mrs Pelosi's deputy, Katherine Clark, told CNN the House could move on impeachment next week. Media reports, quoting unnamed sources, said Mr Trump had suggested to aides he was considering granting a pardon to himself in the final days of his presidency.The legality of such a move is untested. It wasn't until Thursday night, more than 24 hours after the US Capitol had been ransacked by his supporters, that Donald Trump released a recorded statement calling for ""healing and reconciliation"" in a wounded nation. That was the very least that could be expected from a US president in a time of crises, and it probably will not be enough to silence calls for his removal, impeachment or resignation. Those demands have been coming from the political left, of course, but also from parts of the right  - longtime critics, from former allies and, remarkably, even the conservative editorial page of Rupert Murdoch's Wall Street Journal. Ever since November's election, when Trump chose to attack the results rather than admit defeat, a reckoning was coming. The pressure, like a malfunctioning steam engine, was building toward a catastrophic ending. On Thursday night, the president began trying to pick up the pieces. Teleprompter Trump had spoken. In past crises, unscripted Trump has quickly returned, with words and actions that reveal his earlier comments were insincere. With 12 days left in his presidency, the question is whether, or more likely when, that Trump will return - and what happens when he does. President Trump returned to Twitter on Thursdayfollowing a 12-hour freeze of his account. His message was the closest he has come to a formal acceptance of his defeat after weeks of falsely insisting he actually won the election in a ""landslide"". ""Now Congress has certified the results a new administration will be inaugurated on January 20th,"" the Republican said in a video, without mentioning Mr Biden by name. ""My focus now turns to ensuring a smooth, orderly and seamless transition of power. This moment calls for healing and reconciliation."" This video can not be played 'Treason, traitors and thugs'  - the words lawmakers used to describe Capitol riot Mr Trump said he had ""immediately deployed"" the National Guard to expel the intruders, though some US media reported he had hesitated to send in the troops, leaving his vice-president to give the order. He also praised his ""wonderful supporters"" and promised ""our incredible journey is only just beginning"". Law enforcement have been heavily criticised after they were overrun by the protesters. Mr Biden said: ""Nobody could tell me that if it was a group of Black Lives Matter protesters yesterday they wouldn't have been treated very differently than the thugs that stormed the Capitol."" Images captured inside the Capitol building showed protesters roaming through some of the corridors unimpeded. The FBI is seeking to identify those involved in the rampage, andthe Washington DC police have released pictures of ""persons of interest"" for their involvement in the riot.,externalThe Department of Justice says people could face charges of seditious conspiracy, as well as rioting and insurrection. Questions mount over security failure How the 25th Amendment could be used Who stormed the Capitol? Washington police say 68 people have so far been arrested. One of those detained at the Capitol had a ""military-style automatic weapon and 11 Molotov cocktails (petrol bombs)"", according to the federal attorney for Washington DC. The official responsible for security in the House of Representatives, the sergeant at arms, has resigned. Mr Schumer has called for his counterpart in the Senate to be sacked. USCP chief Steven Sund is also resigning, effective 16 January, following calls from Mrs Pelosi. On Thursday, crews began installing a non-scalable 7ft (2m) fence around the Capitol which will remain in place for at least 30 days. This video can not be played Joe Biden: Black Lives Matter protesters would have been treated ""differently"" Ashli Babbitt, a 35-year-old US Air Force veteran from San Diego, California,was named as the woman fatally shot by a police officerwho has now been placed on leave. Law enforcement told US media the victim was unarmed. Three others died after sufferingÂ unspecified medical emergencies on Capitol grounds: Benjamin Philips, 50, from Pennsylvania; Kevin Greeson, 55, from Alabama; and Rosanne Boyland, 34, from Georgia. Mr Greeson's family said he died of a heart attack. Police said that 14 officers had been injured in the riot. On Thursday evening, Education Secretary Betsy DeVos - one of the longest serving members of the president's administration - became the second cabinet member to quit following the Capitol riot. In her resignation letter, Ms DeVos accused the president of fomenting Wednesday's disorder. ""There is no mistaking the impact your rhetoric had on the situation, and it is the inflection point for me."" Earlier in the day, Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao stepped down, saying she had been ""deeply troubled"" by the rampage. Other aides to quit include special envoy Mick Mulvaney, a senior national security official, and the chief of staff to First Lady Melania Trump. A state department adviser was also sacked after calling Mr Trump ""unfit for office"" in a tweet. What's the 25th Amendment? Who stormed the Capitol?

"This video can not be played Education minister Kirsty Williams says online learning must continue for now Schools and colleges in Wales will stay closed to most pupils until the February half term unless there is a ""significant"" fall in Covid cases. First Minister Mark Drakeford also confirmedcurrent lockdown restrictionswould be extended and ""strengthened"". This means non-essential retail, hospitality venues, licensed premises and leisure facilities remain closed and showrooms must now shut as well. Mr Drakeford said: ""The pandemic has reached a significant point."" He told BBC Radio Wales the announcement was the ""best certainty"" he could offer parents, pupils and teachers, ""in a world which is highly uncertain and where things change almost every single day"". The phased return to face-to-face learning at some Welsh universities has also been postponed, while internal GCSE, A-level and AS-level assessments have been cancelled. The announcement follows a similar move in England, where Prime Minister Boris Johnson has already saidschools would not open before half term. Spring half term in Wales is scheduled to take place the week beginning Monday 15 February. Wales has been in analert level four lockdown since 20 Decemberin an attempt to reduce the transmission of coronavirus. On Thursday,63 further deaths from coronaviruswere reported by Public Health Wales. What are Wales' lockdown rules? What is the latest Covid advice for children? School closures 'throwing children under the bus' Speaking to BBC Radio Wales, Mr Drakeford said the new variant was more easily spread and stricter lockdown measures were now needed to keep people safe. Ministers are in talks with employers and unions and changes are set to be announced for workplaces - to protect workers - early next week. Mr Drakeford said he wanted to see the way supermarkets were policed return to the way they were during the first lockdown,with strict number limits in stores and social distancing measures abided to. But he said a curfew, meaning people would have to be in their homes by a certain time,similar to that seen in Northern Ireland, was not currently being considered. This video can not be played Parents and teachers say they want to know when schools will reopen in Wales Schools and colleges had already been told they would have toteach online until 18 January at the earliest, however this will now continue if cases of the virus do not fall ""materially"" before the next review date on 29 January. If cases do not drop, that would mean schools would reopen on 22 February at the earliest, and internal exams have also been cancelled. But teaching unions have warned that moreuniformed lateral flow testing needs to be in placeand teachers must be vaccinated before talks on how to reopen schools can begin. Speaking at the Welsh Government coronavirus briefing, Mr Drakeford said people working at special schools and school and college staff who were at risk would soon be vaccinated. Cardiff University has also confirmed that a phased return to in-person teaching has been cancelled, with learning continuing online for most students until 22 February. Students currently have to have hadtwo lateral flow tests confirming they are negative for Covid-19 before they return to Welsh campuses- and face to face teaching is only resuming for medical students and those who have practical parts of their courses on campus. Mr Drakeford said: ""Universities have worked hard to make sure that when students do return it is done in a careful and controlled way, with the safety of those young people and their communities at the forefront of their planning."" The announcement affecting showrooms means any retailers which allow people to browse and then order for a future date - such as kitchens, bathrooms, furniture and car sales - must close. Click and collect will still be allowed. Confirmingalert level four,externalrestrictions would continue for at least three more weeks, Mr Drakeford told Radio Wales the lockdown measures were already leading to cases falling, but the rate remained high. ""There are some positive signs that the huge collective effort we are making is making a difference, but the numbers are stubbornly high,"" he said. ""We have not yet seen an impact of those falls feeding into the number of people being admitted to hospital and becoming, sometimes, so ill they need intensive care. ""We need to see the numbers come down as well so that our NHS is genuinely able to cope with the enormous pressure it is currently facing."" Mr Drakeford said huge efforts were being made to rollout the Covid-19 vaccines, and with the ""end being in sight"" it was more important than ever for people to follow the rules and stay home. ""We have made so many sacrifices together and we mustn't stop now,"" he said. Schools in Wales closed early before the Christmas break and may not reopen until late February Schools and colleges are open for children of critical workers, as well as vulnerable learners and anyone who needs to complete essential exams or assessments All nurseries and childcare settings remain open Universities in Wales had already agreed a staggered start to term, but these are now being pushed back with learning continuing online Welsh university students studying in England should not return to campuses and will be taught online after a separatelockdownwas imposed Education Minister Kirsty Williams said: ""Schools and colleges have been safe and secure environments throughout the pandemic and that continues to be the case. ""However, the latestTAC,externalreport is clear on education's contribution. We know that school and college settings can contribute to wider social mixing outside the education environment and, right now, we all have to play our part in supressing this virus."" Ms Williams said the government would use the period until the next review date to ""look at all the possibilities for a phased and safe return of some pupils, such as those studying for qualifications, or the youngest children who find distance learning the most difficult"". Following the announcement, exams regulator Qualifications Wales cancelled the spring ""internal assessment window"" for GCSE, AS and A-level pupils, which was scheduled for 22 February - 23 April. This was introduced following the decision that exams would be cancelledin 2021. Chief executive Philip Blaker said: ""We know that learners need clarity about how they will be assessed and there will be clarity on revised arrangements soon."" Mr Drakeford said discussions were under way between teachers and education officials over ways children could catch up after missing time in school. This video can not be played This map shows the pattern of death rates involving Covid-19 by week since the pandemic began Speaking at Friday's Welsh Government coronavirus briefing, Mr Drakeford said police and local authorities would continue to crack down on people who break lockdown rules. Since the start of the pandemic, 3,585 fines have been handed out by police forces in Wales. ""Of course I want to thank everyone for following the rules and helping to keep Wales safe. It's always frustrating when a small minority act as though those rules do not apply to them,"" he added. ""I want everybody to know that where people knowingly and persistently break the rules, action will be taken. Too many lives have been lost to this awful virus to allow anybody to believe that they do not share in the responsibility that binds us all."" Unions welcomed the news saying the health and safety of pupils and staff ""had to be a priority"", but said teachers must now be given the vaccine as a priority, and pupils and staff must be protected before talks about reopening schools began. Currently teachers are not on the priority list for immunisation, and have to wait to get the jab dependent on their age and if they have a medical condition. When will I get the vaccine and what does it mean? Laura Doel, director of The National Association of Headteachers Cymru, said a ""properly organised"" testing regime needed to be put in place for schools, and special schools and pupil referral units needed support to remain open. ""Any plan that sees school staff return to face-to-face learning should be afforded as much protection as possible against the virus,"" she said.""Once these issues have been addressed, then we can discuss the orderly return to school we all want."" Meanwhile, Eithne Hughes, director of the Association of School and College Leaders Cymru said: ""I think we would be happier if we had clarity about what that date looks like, it would give confidence in the system."" Opposition parties called for clear plans on how schools would return and for support to make sure pupils from poorer backgrounds did not fall behind due to a ""digital divide"". Plaid Cymru's education spokeswoman Sian Gwenllian said: ""The Welsh Government must plan now for the gradual and safe reopening of schools, putting in place safety measures, and should lay out plans for a vaccination programme for schools staff."" Welsh Conservative education spokeswoman Suzy Davies called for the Welsh Government to publish evidence on its reasons for closing schools, bring forward vaccines for teachers, and that money must be made available for all pupils to access laptops for online learning. ""This is another bleak day for education in Wales,"" she said. ""Decisions aren't easy to make and I urge everyone involved in the journeys to and from school to consider how they might help schools open again and stay open.""

"The storming of the US Capitol building in Washington DC stunned viewers around the world. But how did Americans feel seeing the seat of their government being ransacked? We asked members of our BBC voter panel for their views. Simon grew up in Uganda during its civil war and became a US citizen last year. A master's student and stay-at-home father, he warns that, while things may settle down, ""democracy is not guaranteed"". I'm disgusted but not surprised. I anticipated this would happen and it was a matter of when, not if. I didn't anticipate that it would happen in the capital. This is the president whose people - since the racial justice movement in the summer - said they were for ""law and order"". So the ""law and order"" people broke into the Capitol and changed the American flag with the Trump flag. History shows that has not happened in over 200 years, so it tells you how dangerous this man is. In Uganda, in November, when the opposition was arrested, people took to the streets and got shot. Here, in the summer, the Capitol building was protected and they were breaking up peaceful protests. World reacts to 'attack on US democracy' A visual guide to the Congress riots It's clear that [Trump supporters] have been organising, we've seen this was going to happen, yet we subconsciously did not think that white people are a threat. That is the construct of this country and how law enforcement viewed it. This video can not be played 'Treason, traitors and thugs'  - the words lawmakers used to describe Capitol riot Taylor is a staunch Trump supporter and recently travelled to Washington DC for a post-election pro-Trump rally. A photographer by trade, she was upset by the rioting but believes unsubstantiated claims that left-wing radicals were behind the violence. It was just heart-breaking to watch what was going on and the behaviour of protesters is just not like the Trump people I've been around. If it did come from any conservatives, then I condemn it. There's no excuse for violence. It doesn't change my support for Trump. The people that love Trump, that's not going to change no matter if he gets a second term or not. It just means we're going to hold out for 2024 and hope either he runs again or his kids do. What does a deadly day mean for Trump's legacy? Who stormed the Capitol? The deep roots of Trumpâs 'voter fraud' strategy Our country is going to go downhill over the next four years if Biden does take office. I'm actually moving today out of the city into the suburbs of a Republican county because I am afraid of how Democratic counties will end up under a Biden presidency. We're going to catapult towards socialism and communism. I'm worried for the country's future, but regardless of who takes office, we have a lot of healing to do. I hope we can all find our common humanity and embrace each other when this is all over, which is hopefully soon. James is a lifelong Republican who worked on Capitol Hill for the party for nearly two decades, but cast his first ever vote for a Democrat in the 2020 election. He was stunned by 6 January's events and expects it to become a bad footnote in the country's history. I find it absolutely shocking. I didn't think it would come to this. I had actually thought about going down to the protests with a sign that said ""Republicans Against Trump"". My brother said, if I had done that, there would have been five deaths, not four, and he may have been right. I'm astounded by the stupidity of these people who show up without masks and who are being filmed. Quite a few of them are going to prison. It's a serious situation when you break past a police barricade and go into a building that's supposed to be secure. I have a lot of friends who say things couldn't get worse, but I have to remind them, as a student of history, that it has been worse. The Civil War was much worse. There was a lot of violence in the South during the Reconstruction period. This is something the country will get over. I was heartened by President-elect Biden's speech yesterday. Finally we've got someone who's sounding presidential. We haven't had it for the last four years. This video can not be played Phone footage reveals chaotic scenes inside US Capitol A'Kayla is a college student who supports the Black Lives Matter movement. She says law enforcement ""coddled"" the rioters at the Capitol and thus made an argument for police reform because they were far more aggressive at protests she attended. It's so irritating I can't put into words how frustrating it is. They stormed the Capitol and the police were gentle and lackadaisical with them. I expected the police to use force, but they were so kind and gentle. During the summer, when the Black Lives Matter protests were going on, so many people were injured, locked up and lost their lives. From my own experience, marching peacefully on the front lines in Charleston, we had tear gas thrown at us and had to pour milk in our eyes. It was excruciating. And for what? We're marching for a cause, because we had the murder of somebody by the police. What are they upset about? They're upset because we are living in a democracy and they didn't get their way. During one of the debates, when Trump said ""stand back and stand by"", is this what he was talking about? This is the calm before the storm. I think it's going to get way more ugly, but Kamala [Harris] and Joe [Biden] are a symbol of change and hope. Whether [Trump supporters] like it or not, America is moving towards a more progressive country and there's going to be a lot of changes.

"This video can not be played Transport Secretary Grant Shapps: 'We're trying to stop a new variant coming here' All international passengers will soon have to test negative for Covid-19 before travelling to the UK. People arriving by plane, train or boat, including UK nationals, will have to take a test up to 72 hours before leaving the country they are in. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said travellers ""can't board... without having that negative test"". But even with a negative test, arrivals from countries not on the travel corridor list must still quarantine. Mr Shapps said the government was ""very keen"" to set up compulsory testing now because of the new variant of the virus circulating in South Africa, which he said was ""causing great concern with the scientists"". ""They're not sure whether, for example, the vaccine will be able to deal with it in the first place, and we're very, very keen to keep it out,"" he told BBC Breakfast. The new variant prevalent in South Africa has got some potentially concerning changes that experts are closely monitoring. While it is extremely unlikely the mutations would render vaccines useless, scientists are doing tests to make sure immunisation will still work well. Even in the worst case scenario, vaccines can be redesigned and tweaked in a matter of weeks or months to be a better match if necessary, experts say. South Africa coronavirus variant: What's the risk? What are the new UK travel rules? Why Instagram is still full of influencers 'on holiday' Covid cases rise 27% in week after Christmas It comes after a further 1,162 deaths within 28 days of a positive test were reported in the UK on Thursday - the second consecutive day of more than 1,000 recorded fatalities. There were also 52,618 new cases. The R number - the average number of people that one infected person will infect - is now between one and 1.4,scientists have estimated.,external Amid the surge in cases, Prime Minister Boris Johnson has pledgedto offer ""hundreds of thousands"" of Covid vaccines per day in Englandby 15 January. On Friday, a third vaccine - made by Moderna -was approved for usein the UK. Under the new rules,external- which are expected to come in from next week - anyone who arrives in the UK and has not got proof of a negative test could face an immediate Â£500 fine. But there will be exemptions for: children under 11 hauliers those travelling from countries without the infrastructure to deliver tests - although details of those have not been released yet arrivals from the Common Travel Area with Ireland. All passengers arriving from countries not on the government'stravel corridor list,externalmust still self-isolate for 10 days, regardless of their test result. Mr Shappstold LBC,externalthe testing rule will come into force ""likely on Wednesday or Thursday next week"", and details of how to get tests abroad will be published on the gov.uk website. The rule will be UK-wide, although Northern Ireland said it had only ""agreed in principle"" and was working to solve any policy and operational issues. Non-essential travel abroad is not currently allowed in the UK, after lockdowns were brought in. People on holiday abroad could now face a scramble to book a test before their flight home ""All in all, the thought of an idyllic holiday 'away from it all' has been about as far from the truth as possible,"" says Rob Howard, who is is currently on holiday in Tenerife. He flew out before Christmas and - after deciding to extend his holiday by a week and rebooking a cancelled flight - is due to fly back next Wednesday. Reacting to the news that he will now likely need to take a Covid test before travelling, Rob, from Nuneaton, says: ""We are going to be expected to self isolate for 10 days so what is the point of this?"" Meanwhile, freelance MOT tester Matthew Auty, who lives in Normandy in France but works in Portsmouth during the week, says he's unhappy about the potential cost. ""These restrictions are reasonable for tourist travel but they are unfair for people in my position,"" he says. Figures from the aviation industry have urged the government to lift the rules as quickly as possible. ""This measure will destroy any confidence in forward bookings for air travel and for ferries, and it will essentially close off the UK,"" said Ryanair chief Michael O'Leary. He called for the government to set an ""end date"" for the rules, adding: ""The real solution to this is vaccination, not artificial travel restrictions. ""Boris Johnson has told us he will have vaccinated the 14 million high risk categories by the middle of February. What we need Grant Shapps to do today is confirm then that this ridiculous pre-arrival testing will then be removed by the middle of February."" The boss of Heathrow, John Holland-Kaye, said of the rule: ""If this will help, then so be it."" But he called it a ""really belt and braces approach"", adding: ""We have always argued for pre-departure testing as an alternative to quarantine... now we're going to have both"". ""And it can only be a temporary measure, very few people will travel with this in place,"" he added to BBC Radio 4's Today programme. Tim Alderslade, the chief executive of the industry body Airlines UK, said the move should be ""a short-term, emergency measure only"". ""Once the rollout of the vaccine accelerates, the focus must be on returning travel to normal as quickly as possible"", he added, including ""removing the need to quarantine or test"". Labour's shadow home secretary Nick Thomas-Symonds said the new measures were ""necessary"" but highlighted that the opposition party ""has been calling for a comprehensive strategy on testing for international travel since April"".

The latest travel curbs come as all of the UK is under strict Covid rules, with lockdowns in England, Wales, Northern Ireland and most of Scotland - meaning there is very little international travel. At a Downing Street press conference on Thursday,the prime minister confirmedalmost 1.5 million people in the UK had now received at least one dose of a Covid vaccine, but warned there would likely be ""lumpiness and bumpiness"" as the rollout continued.

"Police named the victim as 19-year-old Kaelah Marlow A young woman has died after a rare suspected shark attack in New Zealand. Police named the victim as 19-year-old Kaelah Marlow, from Hamilton. Marlow was taken out of the water still alive but died at the scene despite efforts to save her life. Police said it appeared she had been injured by a shark. The attack happened at Waihi Beach on North Island not far from the country's biggest city Auckland. ""Police extend our deepest sympathies to Kaelah's family and loved ones at this very difficult time,"" police said in a statement. ""We appreciate her death was extremely traumatic for those who were at Waihi Beach yesterday and we are offering victim support services to anyone who requires it,"" the statement said. Shark attacks are unusual in the country and this is thought to be the first fatality since 2013. Local media cited witnesses as saying the woman had been swimming right in front of the lifeguard flags on Thursday. When they heard screams, lifeguards went out by boat immediately and pulled her to shore. How do you stop sharks attacking? Shark attack was like 'being hit by a truck' It is not clear what kind of shark attacked Kaelah Marlow, but an eyewitness reportedly claimed it was a great white, a species which is protected in the waters around New Zealand. ""Sharks are reasonably common near all northern beaches of New Zealand, most are harmless and even species considered dangerous very rarely interact with swimmers,"" shark researcher Kina Scollay told the BBC. ""My thoughts and sympathies are with the victim's family and we need to remember that this is a real tragedy to real people. I worry that this gets lost sight of in the media scramble after such events."" One witness quoted by local media said he believed a great white shark attacked the woman Mr Scolley said that while attacks were rare, there were ways to be careful about interactions that could go wrong. Among the risk factors are, for instance, fish feeding events or dead animals in the water. ""If a large shark approaches or is seen nearby people should stay calm, warn those nearby and calmly exit the water,"" he said. A seven-day rahui, a traditional Maori prohibition restricting access to an area, has been placed on the beach. The last recorded shark attack was in 2018 when a man was injured - but survived  - at Baylys Beach. Over the past 170 years, there have only been 13 fatal shark attacks documented in New Zealand,according to the country's department of conservation.,external This video can not be played The shark net debate Shark attack was like 'being hit by a truck' Man killed by shark in Western Australia At least 10 confirmed dead in Los Angeles wildfires What's the latest on the LA fires, and what caused them?

"Hyundai has sparked confusion over a possible electric car tie-up with Apple. The South Korean car company initially said it was in the ""early stage"" of talks with the iPhone maker about a possible electric car partnership. But hours later it backtracked and said it was talking with a number of potential partners without naming Apple. Hyundai's share price rose more than 20% when the tie-up was announced. ""Apple and Hyundai are in discussions but they are at an early stage and nothing has been decided,"" it said in a statement which was later revised. Hyundai's value shot up $9bn (Â£6.5bn) after the Apple announcement. While an updated statement said it was talking to a number of companies about a possible electric car tie-up including Apple, a later version omitted the US tech firm. Apple is known for its secretiveness when it comes to new products and partnerships. ""I'm not surprised to see a big jump in the valuation of Hyundai. The stock market loves car companies who are tech firms as seen with Tesla rise,"" said Sarwant Singh, managing partner at consultants Frost & Sullivan. ""This partnership helps Hyundai be seen as a tech innovator."" Last month, news emerged that Apple was moving forward with self-driving car technology with a 2024 launch date. The electric vehicle (EV) market is becoming increasingly competitive, with companies such as Tesla grabbing the headlines with its rapidly-increasing valuation. Tesla chief executive Elon Musk is now the richest man in the world, displacing Amazon founder Jeff Bezos. Hyundai releases car with solar panel roof Hyundai shows off 'walking car' Elon Musk says Apple's boss snubbed takeover deal Soaring share price creates army of 'Teslanaires' Experts say an electric vehicle from Apple is still at least five years away. They say pandemic-related delays could push the start of production into 2025 or beyond. Hyundai has already been pushing into new technologies such as electric, driverless and flying cars. Last month, it took a controlling stake in Boston Dynamics in a deal that valued the mobile robot firm at $1.1bn. The company is also setting up a $4bn autonomous-driving joint venture with auto parts supplier Aptiv. Both partners will invest $2bn, while Ireland-based Aptiv will contribute about 700 engineers and transfer patents and intellectual property to the venture.

"This video can not be played Education minister Kirsty Williams says online learning must continue for now Schools and colleges in Wales will stay closed to most pupils until the February half term unless there is a ""significant"" fall in Covid cases. First Minister Mark Drakeford also confirmedcurrent lockdown restrictionswould be extended and ""strengthened"". This means non-essential retail, hospitality venues, licensed premises and leisure facilities remain closed and showrooms must now shut as well. Mr Drakeford said: ""The pandemic has reached a significant point."" He told BBC Radio Wales the announcement was the ""best certainty"" he could offer parents, pupils and teachers, ""in a world which is highly uncertain and where things change almost every single day"". The phased return to face-to-face learning at some Welsh universities has also been postponed, while internal GCSE, A-level and AS-level assessments have been cancelled. The announcement follows a similar move in England, where Prime Minister Boris Johnson has already saidschools would not open before half term. Spring half term in Wales is scheduled to take place the week beginning Monday 15 February. Wales has been in analert level four lockdown since 20 Decemberin an attempt to reduce the transmission of coronavirus. On Thursday,63 further deaths from coronaviruswere reported by Public Health Wales. What are Wales' lockdown rules? What is the latest Covid advice for children? School closures 'throwing children under the bus' Speaking to BBC Radio Wales, Mr Drakeford said the new variant was more easily spread and stricter lockdown measures were now needed to keep people safe. Ministers are in talks with employers and unions and changes are set to be announced for workplaces - to protect workers - early next week. Mr Drakeford said he wanted to see the way supermarkets were policed return to the way they were during the first lockdown,with strict number limits in stores and social distancing measures abided to. But he said a curfew, meaning people would have to be in their homes by a certain time,similar to that seen in Northern Ireland, was not currently being considered. This video can not be played Parents and teachers say they want to know when schools will reopen in Wales Schools and colleges had already been told they would have toteach online until 18 January at the earliest, however this will now continue if cases of the virus do not fall ""materially"" before the next review date on 29 January. If cases do not drop, that would mean schools would reopen on 22 February at the earliest, and internal exams have also been cancelled. But teaching unions have warned that moreuniformed lateral flow testing needs to be in placeand teachers must be vaccinated before talks on how to reopen schools can begin. Speaking at the Welsh Government coronavirus briefing, Mr Drakeford said people working at special schools and school and college staff who were at risk would soon be vaccinated. Cardiff University has also confirmed that a phased return to in-person teaching has been cancelled, with learning continuing online for most students until 22 February. Students currently have to have hadtwo lateral flow tests confirming they are negative for Covid-19 before they return to Welsh campuses- and face to face teaching is only resuming for medical students and those who have practical parts of their courses on campus. Mr Drakeford said: ""Universities have worked hard to make sure that when students do return it is done in a careful and controlled way, with the safety of those young people and their communities at the forefront of their planning."" The announcement affecting showrooms means any retailers which allow people to browse and then order for a future date - such as kitchens, bathrooms, furniture and car sales - must close. Click and collect will still be allowed. Confirmingalert level four,externalrestrictions would continue for at least three more weeks, Mr Drakeford told Radio Wales the lockdown measures were already leading to cases falling, but the rate remained high. ""There are some positive signs that the huge collective effort we are making is making a difference, but the numbers are stubbornly high,"" he said. ""We have not yet seen an impact of those falls feeding into the number of people being admitted to hospital and becoming, sometimes, so ill they need intensive care. ""We need to see the numbers come down as well so that our NHS is genuinely able to cope with the enormous pressure it is currently facing."" Mr Drakeford said huge efforts were being made to rollout the Covid-19 vaccines, and with the ""end being in sight"" it was more important than ever for people to follow the rules and stay home. ""We have made so many sacrifices together and we mustn't stop now,"" he said. Schools in Wales closed early before the Christmas break and may not reopen until late February Schools and colleges are open for children of critical workers, as well as vulnerable learners and anyone who needs to complete essential exams or assessments All nurseries and childcare settings remain open Universities in Wales had already agreed a staggered start to term, but these are now being pushed back with learning continuing online Welsh university students studying in England should not return to campuses and will be taught online after a separatelockdownwas imposed Education Minister Kirsty Williams said: ""Schools and colleges have been safe and secure environments throughout the pandemic and that continues to be the case. ""However, the latestTAC,externalreport is clear on education's contribution. We know that school and college settings can contribute to wider social mixing outside the education environment and, right now, we all have to play our part in supressing this virus."" Ms Williams said the government would use the period until the next review date to ""look at all the possibilities for a phased and safe return of some pupils, such as those studying for qualifications, or the youngest children who find distance learning the most difficult"". Following the announcement, exams regulator Qualifications Wales cancelled the spring ""internal assessment window"" for GCSE, AS and A-level pupils, which was scheduled for 22 February - 23 April. This was introduced following the decision that exams would be cancelledin 2021.

Since the start of the pandemic, 3,585 fines have been handed out by police forces in Wales. ""Of course I want to thank everyone for following the rules and helping to keep Wales safe. It's always frustrating when a small minority act as though those rules do not apply to them,"" he added. ""I want everybody to know that where people knowingly and persistently break the rules, action will be taken. Too many lives have been lost to this awful virus to allow anybody to believe that they do not share in the responsibility that binds us all."" Unions welcomed the news saying the health and safety of pupils and staff ""had to be a priority"", but said teachers must now be given the vaccine as a priority, and pupils and staff must be protected before talks about reopening schools began. Currently teachers are not on the priority list for immunisation, and have to wait to get the jab dependent on their age and if they have a medical condition. When will I get the vaccine and what does it mean? Laura Doel, director of The National Association of Headteachers Cymru, said a ""properly organised"" testing regime needed to be put in place for schools, and special schools and pupil referral units needed support to remain open. ""Any plan that sees school staff return to face-to-face learning should be afforded as much protection as possible against the virus,"" she said.""Once these issues have been addressed, then we can discuss the orderly return to school we all want."" Meanwhile, Eithne Hughes, director of the Association of School and College Leaders Cymru said: ""I think we would be happier if we had clarity about what that date looks like, it would give confidence in the system."" Opposition parties called for clear plans on how schools would return and for support to make sure pupils from poorer backgrounds did not fall behind due to a ""digital divide"". Plaid Cymru's education spokeswoman Sian Gwenllian said: ""The Welsh Government must plan now for the gradual and safe reopening of schools, putting in place safety measures, and should lay out plans for a vaccination programme for schools staff."" Welsh Conservative education spokeswoman Suzy Davies called for the Welsh Government to publish evidence on its reasons for closing schools, bring forward vaccines for teachers, and that money must be made available for all pupils to access laptops for online learning.

"At least five deaths have been linked to the violence, which saw dozens of police injured With the country still reeling from Wednesday's violence in Washington, serious questions are being asked about how such a massive security breach was able to happen at the heart of US government. Crowds of pro-Trump supporters were able to force their way inside one of the country's most historically and politically significant buildings while elected lawmakers were inside moving to certify Joe Biden's election victory. The world watched as a mob of rioters seemed to roam free around inside -  looting and vandalising symbols of US democracy as they went. What does a deadly day mean for Trump's legacy? In pictures: Pro-Trump protesters storm Capitol Could Trump be removed from power? President-Elect Joe Biden has been scathing of the ""unacceptable"" handling of the rioters and compared it to the heavy-handed militarised response to last year's Black Lives Matter protests. Lindsey Graham, a Republican Senator, also railed against the security failures. ""They could have blown the building up. They could have killed us all. They could've destroyed the government,"" he said. Criticism centres on preparation by police and their failure to anticipate possible violence, despite evidence that radical pro-Trump supporters and other groups were openly discussing their plans online. This video can not be played Phone footage reveals chaotic scenes inside US Capitol The Washington Post, citing sources close to the matter,says that Capitol Police charged with guarding the building and its grounds did not make early requests for help from the city's main police force or the National Guard,externalnor set-up a multiagency command centre to coordinate response to any violence. And without an adequate security perimeter in place, their sparse police lines were quickly overwhelmed by thousands descending on the Capitol. Dozens of officers were injured, and one later died, in the effort to retake control -  including some with armour, weapons and chemical spray agents. To many, the optics were a sharp contrast to last year's protests following the death of George Floyd, when rows of National Guard Troops guarded and enforced order in the capital. The violence came against a surreal backdrop of US historical figures and scenes Even hours into Wednesday's violence, protesters were filmed being escorted or guided out of the building without arrest - even appearing to be helped down the Capitol stairs and having doors held open for them to exit. Another viral clip appeared to show a police officer posing for a selfie with a man inside. Many rioters photographed and even live-streamed their crimes. One was pictured, his face uncovered, with his feet up on House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's desk, and then showing off a letter he appeared to have stolen from her office. A Confederate flag was paraded by another unmasked man and a well-known conspiracy theorist - wearing horns, fur and facepaint - was seen posing by a Senate chair that had been occupied by Vice President Mike Pence just hours earlier. Nick Ochs, a known member of the Proud Boys far-right group, tweeted a selfie of himself inside and later told CNN: ""There were thousands of people in there - [the police] had no control of the situation. I didn't get stopped or questioned."" The striking image of Richard Barnett, 60, is one of several to have gone viral But despite the severity and scale of the chaos, relatively few arrests had been made by nightfall Wednesday. A visual guide to the Congress riots 'They tried to break in - then I heard a shot' Supporters of BLM and others on the left have voiced their outrage at the perceived double-standard of policing the events. The incoming vice-president, Kamala Harris, said the disconnect was ""unacceptable"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Former First Lady Michelle Obama also released a lengthy statement,external. ""I cannot think about moving on or turning the page until we reckon with the reality of what we saw yesterday,"" she wrote. ""True progress will be possible only once we acknowledge that this disconnect exists and take steps to repair it."" Top congressional Democrats Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi were damning in their criticism of security failures - helping to force the departures of top officials. The chief of the US Capitol Police, Steven Sund, had initially defended his force in a statement on Thursday - describing the actions of law enforcement as ""heroic"" and their plan robust. But within hours his resignation was announced, alongside the departures of the sergeant-at-arms for both the House and Senate. This video can not be played 'Treason, traitors and thugs'  - the words lawmakers used to describe Capitol riot Aside from the clear lack of preparation, confusion mounted during the violence about when and if other security forces were being deployed to help. According to the Washington Post,Pentagon officials had placed strict operational limits on the DC National Guard,externalahead of protests and remained concerned about the ""optics"" of armed military personnel at the Capitol. Defence officials on Thursday sought to defend the speed in which they authorised and mobilised Guardsmen to respond to the violence. Multiple US media outlets, citing senior sources, have suggested that President Donald Trump allegedly showed reluctance for the National Guard to be used to quell the unrest. If true, this is a complete contrast to the highly visible show of force the president has repeatedly called for against left-wing and BLM protesters. Gordon Corera, the BBC's security correspondent, says this emphasises how security decisions appear to have become politicised under the Trump administration. This video can not be played US Capitol riots: How the world's media reacted Professor Clifford Stott, a specialist in the policing of crowds who advises the UK government, has been analysing the police response to BLM protests in Seattle. He told the BBC there would be ""powerful and important"" questions to be asked about how officials failed to prepared for the escalation by Trump supporters. ""It was the failure to predict that that led them to be inadequately prepared when it did happen and led them to be reactive and have to mobilise more resources,"" he said.  ""It's not just about the complexities of the police response, it's also about what appears to be a poor level of risk assessments around how they understand whether resources might be necessary in the first place."" The gathering of the president's supporters, while Congress was certifying the election result, was not spontaneous. The protest was pre-planned and followed months of escalating rhetoric from President Trump and some of his Republican allies seeking to undermine the result. This video can not be played ""We will never give up, we will never concede"", Trump tells supporters In the days (and indeed weeks and months) before the attack, people monitoring online platforms used by extreme pro-Trump supporters and far-right groups had warned of rhetoric encouraging violence at the Capitol, including toward lawmakers, over the election result. Some were even pictured wearing clothing that said ""MAGA: CIVIL WAR"" printed alongside the 6 January 2021 date. Prof Stott, who researches the psychology of group violence and hooliganism, told the BBC he found the overarching mood of ""joy"" among rioters openly committing crimes particularly interesting. ""There was a very clear purpose to that crowd and that was driven by the idea their actions were legitimate, given their perception that their president - as their commander in chief - had sanctioned them to go and do this,"" he says. ""And that sense that Capitol Hill itself had been over taken by corruption."" How could 25th amendment be used? A history of violence at the US Capitol Some appeared confused and angry at why officers had used force against them. One Yahoo News video, viewed more than 25m times on TikTok, shows a woman visibly upset that she had been maced by police, despite declaring: ""We're storming the capitol - it's a revolution!""

Some radical supporters have responded with disbelief and frustration at the concession video shared by President Trump on Thursday following the violence. The U-turn came only a day after he told supporters: ""We will never give up, we will never concede"" and openly pressured his vice-president to overturn the election result. Vice-President Mike Pence is among those who have called for those involved in the breach to be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law and given the brazen behaviour of many involved, prosecutors surely have no shortage of evidence to draw from. As Facebook moved to remove videos seen to incite or encourage the events, some open-source investigators called for people to archive evidence to help with crowdsourced identification. Meanwhile, many seen in viral images from inside are already known figures within far-right groups and QAnon and related conspiracy networks. Who stormed the Capitol? Dozens of people are already facing charges - including one man officials say had a semi-automatic rifle and 11 Molotov cocktails - and police have also appealed for help identifying offenders not yet in custody. Michael Sherwin, the acting US Attorney for DC, said on Thursday that prosecutors would bring ""the most maximum charges we can"", when asked if crimes such as seditious conspiracy and insurrection could be tabled. He also refused to rule out investigating anyone deemed to have incited the violence, including President Trump. ""We're trying to deal with the closest alligators to the boat right now,"" he said. ""Those are the people who obviously breached the Capitol, created violence and mayhem there and then exited. But yes, we are looking at all actors here, not only the people that went into the building.""

"An image sent to BBC News Indonesia shows Ba'asyir (second from the right) in a vehicle with his family after being released early on Friday A radical Muslim cleric linked to the 2002 Bali bombings has been freed amid concerns over his ongoing influence on extremists. Abu Bakar Ba'asyir was picked up by his family from a jail outside Indonesia's capital Jakarta early on Friday. The 82-year-old is the former head of Jemaah Islamiah, an al-Qaeda-inspired group behind the attack that killed 202 people. Authorities say he will enter a deradicalisation programme. People from 21 nations died in the blasts on 12 October 2002 on the popular holiday island of Bali. The two bombs had ripped through Paddy's Irish Bar and the nearby Sari Club in the Kuta tourist district. Profile:The radical cleric linked to Bali bombings The 12 October 2002 Bali bombing plot It remains to this day Indonesia's deadliest terrorist attack. The release has drawn mixed reactions in Indonesia as well as Australia, where most of the victims were from. Australia's Prime Minister Scott Morrison said it was ""distressing"" for victims' families and that ""it's sometimes not a fair world"". The firebrand preacher was freed after completing a jail term for a conviction unrelated to the bombings. He had been sentenced to 15 years in jail in 2011 for supporting militant training in conservative Aceh province, but the term was later cut due to sentence reductions. Officials reportedly said he had ""served his punishment well"". Previously Ba'asyir had been jailed in 2005 for conspiracy over the Bali bombings, but this conviction was overturned on appeal. He has always denied any involvement in terrorism. Ba'asyir was commander of Jemaah Islamiah (JI), the militant Islamist group, at the time of the Bali bombings. Some described the cleric as the ""mastermind"" behind the blasts but his exact role remains unclear. Sidney Jones, director of the Institute for Policy Analysis of Conflict in Jakarta, said operational decisions were headed by someone else in JI but Ba'asyir would have given a ""de-facto green light"". ""He didn't plan it. But he is the person who could have stopped it if he said no."" Ba'asyir later broke off with JI, going on to found another extremist group, Jamaah Anshorut Tauhid. Ahead of the cleric's release Garil Arnandha, whose father was among the bombing victims, told the BBC: ""I don't agree with Abu Bakar Ba'asyir being released because in my opinion he is still very dangerous and has the potential to revive terrorism in Indonesia."" Endang, his mother, had a different view. ""As a bomb victim I have forgiven him,"" she told the BBC. ""He has served time in jail for his crimes and I really hope he will return to the right path. I am worried but I am trying to have positive thinking because the trauma of losing my husband in the bombing has been horrific."" This video can not be played Garil Arnandha, whose father died in the Bali bombings in 2002, met Ali Imron who is serving a life sentence for the attack In Australia, Prime Minister Scott Morrison said Ba'asyir's release was ""very distressing"" for relatives of those killed, but added it was ""a matter for the Indonesian justice system"". ""That doesn't make it any easier for any Australian to accept that, ultimately. That those who are responsible for the murder of Australians would now be free,"" he said. Eighty-eight Australians were among those who died in Bali. Bali marks deadly bomb attacks The bomb maker turned peacemaker Albert Talarico, a spokesman for the Coogee Dolphins rugby league club in Sydney that lost six members in the nightclub bombings, said it was ""very frustrating for the families"" who had to ""live through the same painful memories again"". ""I don't believe he should be released, but that's their rules,"" added Mr Talarico, speaking to the BBC earlier this week. ""It doesn't seem to be fair to the families."" The jerseys of the Coogee Dolphins club members who died were displayed at a memorial service in 2002 The club honours the six members who lost their lives each day - through the Coogee Dolphins emblem that was changed to reflect their position numbers, and during matches when these numbers are proudly displayed on the team jerseys. ""We carry their numbers on our chests in every match. They were young men in the prime of their lives. We make sure their stories are not forgotten,"" Mr Talarico said. Dr Jones told the BBC she didn't think Ba'asyir's release would have a major impact on the risk of violence in Indonesia. ""I think he will be treated as an elder statesman by conservative Muslim groups that would like to see greater Islamic law in Indonesia. But I don't think he is likely to inspire a new round of violent extremism,"" she said. That's partly down to his waning influence but also the change in how extremists operate today, she added. ""We're seeing less influence of individual clerics and more inspiration and instruction taken from the internet,"" Dr Jones explained. ""We're also seeing the proliferation of very small autonomous cells, not large hierarchical organisations that look to a single leader."" The preacher has always denied any involvement in terrorism After the Bali attacks, Indonesia - backed by Australia and the United States - set up an elite anti-terrorist unit that weakened JI. In 2008 three men were executed for their role in the bombings, and several others have either been jailed or killed by the security forces. Ba'asyir is reported to have pledged allegiance to the Islamic State in 2014 while in jail. The head of Indonesia's anti-terrorism agency Eddy Hartono has said the octogenarian would undergo a deradicalisation programme. ""We're hoping Abu Bakar Bashir after he's free can give peaceful, soothing preachings,"" he said in a statement, according to Reuters news agency. Additional reporting by BBC News Indonesia.

"The Pfizer-BioNtech vaccine started being rolled out in the UK last month People who have had Covid vaccines are being warned to still take care. Vaccination has been shown to prevent severe infection, so even if people do catch the virus, they would be protected from getting seriously ill. The call comes as an NHS nurse working for the Hywel Dda University Health Board area said she contracted Covid-19 while waiting for her second dose. The health board said while the vaccine ""reduces your chance of suffering"", ""no vaccine is 100% effective"". The Pfizer-BioNtech vaccine, which started being rolled out in the UK last month, offersup to 95% protection against Covid-19 after a second dose. On Friday, the First Minister advised people receiving the vaccine to ""continue to act in a precautionary way"". Mark Drakeford said those people should ""recognise the new protection that they have"" but ""recognise as well that for many weeks, and for some months ahead, coronavirus is going to continue to be a feature of all our lives"". The hospital nurse, who works in the Hywel Dda University Health Board area in west Wales, said she felt ""angry and heartbroken"" about catching Covid at this stage. The nurse, who has asked not to be identified, said she was initially relieved to be offered the chance of a vaccine and despite difficulties getting an appointment, she said she received her first dose of the Pfizer-BioNtech vaccine last month. ""It gave me peace of mind. It made me feel safer and that I was doing the right thing for my family... but it gives a false sense of security,"" she said. The nurse said she was told it would take 10 days for the vaccine to offer some protection and reduce the risk of transmission. However, three weeks after the jab, she said she began to feel unwell - with ""quite severe symptoms"" of a bad cough, high temperature and breathlessness - and said she was ""shocked"" when she tested positive for coronavirus. Q&A: When will I get the Covid-19 vaccines? Wales lags behind England as 50,000 vaccinated She said her partner and one of her children also tested positive. The first vaccination rollout - the Pfizer vaccine -began on 8 December last year. Two doses are needed and to date around a million people have already received the first dose. The original advice - in Wales and the rest of the UK - was that people would need the second dose of the Pfizer vaccine three weeks after the first injection. But that changed last month to 12 weeks between doses on the advice of the UK's chief medical officers. The World Health Organisation does not recommend following the UK's decision, but has ""made a provision for countries in exceptional circumstances of vaccine supply constraints and epidemiological settings"" to delay the second dose for a few weeks to maximise the number of people getting a first dose. Pfizer said it has tested the vaccine's efficacy only when the two doses were given up to 21 days apart. The British Medical Association Cymru Wales has previously expressed concern about the length of time between doses. Doctors' union, BMA Cymru Wales, said there was a lack of evidence to support waiting 12 weeks for a second vaccine dose. Chair Dr David Bailey said: ""Our families don't choose to be exposed to a much higher dose of Covid, so we feel it's right that we should be protecting health workers and their families."" Hywel Dda health board said it had already vaccinated more than 10,000 high-risk people, including frontline NHS staff. Deputy Chief Executive Dr Philip Kloer, said: ""It is always distressing to hear about staff contracting the virus. Whilst the vaccine reduces your chance of suffering from Covid-19, no vaccine is 100% effective. ""There is particular risk that you may have contracted Covid-19 immediately prior to having the vaccine without knowing it, or that you may contract it in the week or two following vaccination as your body builds up protection. ""We have communicated the UK policy and assurances on second doses to our staff and assured them they will receive their second dose within 12 weeks of the first."" He added: ""Working within the NHS at the moment is very challenging and we acknowledge how difficult this is. ""Staff have worked tirelessly and made many sacrifices on behalf of caring for our communities and we are extremely grateful.

"This video can not be played When a mob stormed the US capitol US President Donald Trump's opponents in the two houses of Congress have called for him to be removed from office after the violent invasion of the Capitol by a mob of his supporters. Democratic Senator Chuck Schumer said Mr Trump should be removed immediately. If he is not, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi says he could be impeached. Removal would need Republican support and only a few have so far backed it. In a video speech, Mr Trump said he was committed to an ""orderly"" transition. The president said a new administration would be inaugurated on 20 January, and called for ""healing and reconciliation"". He also said he was ""outraged by the violence, lawlessness and mayhem"" on Wednesday and that ""tempers must be cooled and calm restored"". The video was shared on his Twitter account, which was reactivated on Thursday after being suspended following the Capitol riot. At least four people died during the unrest, and 68 have now been arrested. The actions of the police have come under scrutiny, with officers facing criticism for failing to stop the rioters breaking in. The official responsible for security in the House of Representatives, the sergeant at arms, has resigned. Reports say US Capitol Police (USCP) chief Steven Sund is also resigning, effective 16 January, following calls from Ms Pelosi. Mr Schumer has called for his counterpart in the Senate to be sacked. Transport Secretary Elaine Chao is the latest member of the Trump administration to quit in protest over the riots. Several lower-level officials have also resigned. Questions mount over security failure The US Air Force veteran who lost her life in riots Johnson condemns Trump over US Capitol siege President-elect Joe Biden said: ""Nobody could tell me that if it was a group of Black Lives Matter protesters yesterday they wouldn't have been treated very differently than the thugs that stormed the Capitol."" This video can not be played Joe Biden: Black Lives Matter protesters would have been treated ""differently"" A growing number have called for Mr Trump to be removed as president. Most of them are from Mr Biden's Democratic Party but a few Republicans have joined in. ""This president should not hold office one day longer,"" said Mr Schumer, who will lead the Democratic majority in the Senate when it begins its new session later this month. What does a deadly day mean for Trump's legacy? 'They tried to break in - then I heard a shot' Who broke into the building? He urged Mr Trump's cabinet to remove him from office using the 25th Amendment to the US Constitution, which allows the vice-president to step up if the president is unable to perform his duties owing to a mental or physical illness. It would require Vice-President Mike Pence and at least eight cabinet members to break with Mr Trump and invoke the amendment - something they have so far seemed unlikely to do. Ms Pelosi described Mr Trump as ""a very dangerous person"" and said: ""This is an emergency of the highest magnitude."" She left open the option of impeachment if Mr Trump's colleagues did not start 25th Amendment proceedings. However, the Democrats would need to rely on the support of Republicans to secure the necessary two-thirds majority in the Senate to convict Mr Trump under the articles of impeachment in the constitution, and would be unlikely to get those numbers. A visual guide to the storming of Congress Congressman Adam Kinzinger from Illinois was one of the first Republicans to call for use of the 25th Amendment, saying: ""Fires stoked by the president finally leapt out of the pan."" This video can not be played Phone footage reveals chaotic scenes inside US Capitol The Republican governors of Maryland and Vermont have also called for Mr Trump to be removed from office. Democrats on the House Judiciary Committee have said that Mr Trump's actions meet the amendment's requirements. Separately, both the House and the Senate have adjourned until after Mr Biden is sworn in on 20 January. Both houses would have to be recalled in order to start impeachment proceedings. In pictures: Pro-Trump protesters storm Capitol Facebook blocks Trump 'until transition complete' Several Trump administration officials have now resigned over the riots - Elaine Chao is the most high-profile. Ms Chao, who has served through the whole presidency and is married to the top Senate Republican, Mitch McConnell, said the events had ""deeply troubled me in a way that I simply cannot set aside"". Others to quit include special envoy Mick Mulvaney, a senior national security official, and the chief of staff to First Lady Melania Trump. A State Department adviser was also sacked after calling Mr Trump ""unfit for office"" in a tweet. The president is also facing new restrictions on his use of social media. Facebook, which owns Instagram, has suspended him from both platforms at least until he leaves office and possibly indefinitely. Twitter suspended his account for 12 hours. The 25th Amendment, enacted in 1967, was designed to provide a more detailed process for the succession of presidential power. The writers envisioned national catastrophes or a medically incapacitated president as situations the amendment could address. It was not contemplated, at least initially, as a means to drag a president who is viewed as a threat to the nation from office. That, however, is exactly what many Democrats - including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi - are suggesting should happen to Donald Trump. It's what one current Republican congressman, Adam Kinzinger of Illinois, is calling for and what one of Trump's former White House chiefs of staff, John Kelly, said he supported. With just 13 days left in the Trump presidency, the unprecedented step of stripping an unwilling president of power, which requires the consent of the vice-president and a majority of the 15-member presidential cabinet, seems unlikely. But the report that such steps are being contemplated underline the gravity of the current situation. Democrats are also once again talking about impeachment and conviction by the Senate, a process that would take more time but would, as an additional benefit in their minds, prohibit Mr Trump from running for office in the future. Police have been heavily criticised for their response to the violence. Images captured inside the Capitol building showed rioters strolling through some of the corridors unimpeded. One man occupied Ms Pelosi's office, putting his feet up on her desk, while another was photographed walking out carrying a lectern. Police stand guard during the curfew overnight on Wednesday Washington police say 68 people have so far been arrested, only one of them from the DC area. One USCP officer has been placed on leave after a woman was shot dead on the floor of the House of Representatives. The woman, who has been named as air force veteran Ashli Babbitt, 35, was part of a group that forced its way into the chamber while it was still in session. Police said three other people - 50-year-old Benjamin Philips from Pennsylvania; 55-year-old Kevin Greeson from Alabama; and 34-year-old Rosanne Boyland from Georgia - died of unspecified ""medical emergencies"". Mr Greeson's family said he died of a heart attack. The FBI is seeking to identify those involved in the rampage. The Department of Justice says those arrested could face charges of seditious conspiracy, as well as rioting and insurrection. One of those detained at the Capitol had a ""military-style automatic weapon and 11 Molotov cocktails (petrol bombs)"", according to the federal attorney for Washington DC. On Thursday, crews began installing a non-scalable 7ft (2m) fence around the Capitol. It will remain in place for at least 30 days. Michelle Obama, wife of Mr Trump's presidential predecessor, Barack Obama, released a statement calling attention to the racial disparity in the way different protests were policed. She described Mr Trump as ""an infantile and unpatriotic president"", and said it would be impossible to move on until there was a reckoning with Wednesday's events. ""Yesterday made it painfully clear that certain Americans are, in fact, allowed to denigrate the flag and symbols of our nation. They've just got to look the right way,"" she wrote.

"This video can not be played Trump calls for an 'orderly transition of power' to the Biden administration on January 20th A US Capitol police officer has died from injuries sustained in the attack on Congress by a pro-Trump mob as top Democrats have called for the president to be removed for ""inciting"" the riot. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi urged Vice-President Mike Pence to invoke the 25th amendment to the Constitution to declare the president unfit for office. Alternatively, she vowed to initiate the process to impeach the president. Under pressure, Donald Trump finally condemned the ""heinous attack"". Wednesday's violence came hours after Mr Trump encouraged his supporters to fight against the election results as Congress was certifying President-elect Joe Biden's victory in the November vote. Five people have died in relation to the riot, including Brian Sicknick, an officer at the US Capitol Police (USCP) who was ""injured while physically engaging with protesters"", the police said. Americans 'shocked' and 'disgusted' by riots A visual guide to the Congress riots The US Air Force veteran who lost her life in riots Meanwhile, the top congressional Democrats - Speaker Pelosi and Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer - have urged Vice-President Pence and Mr Trump's cabinet to remove the president for ""his incitement of insurrection"". ""The President's dangerous and seditious acts necessitate his immediate removal from office,"" they said in a joint statement. The duo called forMr Trump to be ousted using the 25th Amendment, which allows the vice-president to step up if the president is unable to perform his duties owing to a mental or physical illness. But it would require Mr Pence and at least eight cabinet members to break with Mr Trump and invoke the amendment, something they have so far seemed unlikely to do. Mr Trump is due to leave office on 20 January, when Mr Biden will be sworn in. This video can not be played Phone footage reveals chaotic scenes inside US Capitol Mrs Pelosi indicated that if the vice-president failed to act, she would convene the House to launch their second impeachment proceedings against Mr Trump. However, to succeed in convicting and removing the president, Democrats would need a two-thirds majority in the Senate, and there is no indication they would get those numbers. And it was not clear whether enough time remained to carry out the process. Mrs Pelosi's deputy, Katherine Clark, told CNN the House could move on impeachment next week. Media reports, quoting unnamed sources, said Mr Trump had suggested to aides he was considering granting a pardon to himself in the final days of his presidency.The legality of such a move is untested. It wasn't until Thursday night, more than 24 hours after the US Capitol had been ransacked by his supporters, that Donald Trump released a recorded statement calling for ""healing and reconciliation"" in a wounded nation. That was the very least that could be expected from a US president in a time of crises, and it probably will not be enough to silence calls for his removal, impeachment or resignation. Those demands have been coming from the political left, of course, but also from parts of the right  - longtime critics, from former allies and, remarkably, even the conservative editorial page of Rupert Murdoch's Wall Street Journal. Ever since November's election, when Trump chose to attack the results rather than admit defeat, a reckoning was coming. The pressure, like a malfunctioning steam engine, was building toward a catastrophic ending. On Thursday night, the president began trying to pick up the pieces. Teleprompter Trump had spoken. In past crises, unscripted Trump has quickly returned, with words and actions that reveal his earlier comments were insincere. With 12 days left in his presidency, the question is whether, or more likely when, that Trump will return - and what happens when he does. President Trump returned to Twitter on Thursdayfollowing a 12-hour freeze of his account. His message was the closest he has come to a formal acceptance of his defeat after weeks of falsely insisting he actually won the election in a ""landslide"". ""Now Congress has certified the results a new administration will be inaugurated on January 20th,"" the Republican said in a video, without mentioning Mr Biden by name. ""My focus now turns to ensuring a smooth, orderly and seamless transition of power. This moment calls for healing and reconciliation."" This video can not be played 'Treason, traitors and thugs'  - the words lawmakers used to describe Capitol riot Mr Trump said he had ""immediately deployed"" the National Guard to expel the intruders, though some US media reported he had hesitated to send in the troops, leaving his vice-president to give the order. He also praised his ""wonderful supporters"" and promised ""our incredible journey is only just beginning"". Law enforcement have been heavily criticised after they were overrun by the protesters. Mr Biden said: ""Nobody could tell me that if it was a group of Black Lives Matter protesters yesterday they wouldn't have been treated very differently than the thugs that stormed the Capitol."" Images captured inside the Capitol building showed protesters roaming through some of the corridors unimpeded. The FBI is seeking to identify those involved in the rampage, andthe Washington DC police have released pictures of ""persons of interest"" for their involvement in the riot.,externalThe Department of Justice says people could face charges of seditious conspiracy, as well as rioting and insurrection. Questions mount over security failure How the 25th Amendment could be used Who stormed the Capitol? Washington police say 68 people have so far been arrested. One of those detained at the Capitol had a ""military-style automatic weapon and 11 Molotov cocktails (petrol bombs)"", according to the federal attorney for Washington DC. The official responsible for security in the House of Representatives, the sergeant at arms, has resigned. Mr Schumer has called for his counterpart in the Senate to be sacked. USCP chief Steven Sund is also resigning, effective 16 January, following calls from Mrs Pelosi. On Thursday, crews began installing a non-scalable 7ft (2m) fence around the Capitol which will remain in place for at least 30 days. This video can not be played Joe Biden: Black Lives Matter protesters would have been treated ""differently"" Ashli Babbitt, a 35-year-old US Air Force veteran from San Diego, California,was named as the woman fatally shot by a police officerwho has now been placed on leave.

Three others died after sufferingÂ unspecified medical emergencies on Capitol grounds: Benjamin Philips, 50, from Pennsylvania; Kevin Greeson, 55, from Alabama; and Rosanne Boyland, 34, from Georgia. Mr Greeson's family said he died of a heart attack. Police said that 14 officers had been injured in the riot. On Thursday evening, Education Secretary Betsy DeVos - one of the longest serving members of the president's administration - became the second cabinet member to quit following the Capitol riot. In her resignation letter, Ms DeVos accused the president of fomenting Wednesday's disorder. ""There is no mistaking the impact your rhetoric had on the situation, and it is the inflection point for me."" Earlier in the day, Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao stepped down, saying she had been ""deeply troubled"" by the rampage.

"Young women clap for heroes outside Chelsea and Westminster Hospital in London A revived initiative to applaud the heroes of the pandemic has returned - but much more quietly than last year. It comes after the founder of Clap for Carers distanced herself from its return after facing online abuse. Annemarie Plas wanted to bring back the weekly applause under a new name of Clap for Heroes to lift spirits in the new lockdown but it fell a little flat. Some health workers have said they would rather people stay at home and wear a mask than clap for them. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said he participated at 20:00 GMT on Thursday, but clapping ""isn't enough"". ""They need to be paid properly and given the respect they deserve,"" hetweeted.,external, of the health workers. This video can not be played The weekly clap returned but Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said clapping alone ""wasn't enough"" The idea of clapping and banging pots from doorsteps originally began as a one-off to support NHS staff on 26 March - three days after the UK went into lockdown for the first time. After proving popular it was expanded to cover all key workers and continued every Thursday for 10 weeks last year, with millions of people across the UK taking part. Is this the last hurrah for clap for carers? Clap for Carers creator on her viral challenge Members of the Royal Family and politicians including Prime Minister Boris Johnson also joined in with the show of support. However, the event faced criticism for becoming politicised, with some suggesting the NHS would benefit more from extra funding than applause. Thursday's newly-revived event drew fewer supporters than previously. People in some streets stood on doorsteps and leaned out windows to clap for the pandemic's heroes, and landmarks in London were illuminated blue for the occasion - but reports suggested the applause was noticeably quieter than last year. Annemarie Plas and her family were threatened online for her efforts On Wednesday, Ms Plas, a 36-year-old mother-of-one, announced the return of the initiative, saying she hoped to ""lift the spirit of all of us"" including ""all who are pushing through this difficult time"". But some NHS workers were less than enthusiastic. Ami Jones, an intensive care consultant from Wales,tweeted:,external""No thanks.

And palliative care doctor Rachel Clarke said: ""Please don't clap us. Just wear a mask, wash your hands and respect lockdown."" Ina tweet,externalposted hours before the weekly clap was due to return, Ms Plas, a Dutch national living in south London, said she had been targeted with personal abuse and threats against her and her family by ""a hateful few"" on social media. ""I have no political agenda, I am not employed by the government, I do not work in PR, I am just an average mum at home trying to cope with the lockdown situation,"" she said, in a statement. She said the newly revived clap could and should still happen at 20:00 GMT. ""It's up to each person to decide how relevant or worthwhile they feel it is to participate,"" she said.

"Nursery staff are not advised to wear face coverings Childcare organisations are demanding to see evidence that it is safe for them to remain open while schools and colleges have closed to most pupils. Staff have close contact with children and babies daily, when they change nappies and receive them by the hand from parents, for example. Ministers have insisted early years settings are safe as young children have very low rates of the virus. Nurseries argue the evidence cited is based on data about old variant Covid. 'Very little' virus risk at nurseries - minister Why are nurseries still open this time around? 'It is more important my daughter goes to nursery' England's three main nursery organisations, the Early Years Alliance, the National Day Nurseries Association and childminders' group, Pacey, have joined together to mount a #ProtectEarlyYears campaign. They want the government to provide clear scientific evidence on the risks to early years staff of staying open, particularly in light of the increased transmissibility of the new variant of Covid-19. Sue Cardy, owner and manager of Ready Teddy Go Pre School, in Shoeburyness, Essex said: ""There isn't anyone who has asked: 'Is it 100% safe for us to remain fully open? No one can see the virus and staff may be asymptomatic, and so we all run an element of risk of catching or spreading it."" She added: ""Staff have families and are not all young... 50% of my staff are over 50 and some have underlying medical conditions."" Vicky, the manager of a church pre-school in Cheshire West and Chester said she could potentially have 30 children plus 10 staff in a church hall, with no PPE recommended, and limited social distancing. ""As an early years provider, I am increasingly worried about the safety of both staff and children, yet if we chose to partially close, we could be financially penalised."" And Georgie Morrell from Brighton and Hove said: ""Since re-opening, I have had four households tell me. they are Covid positive. ""This is clearly very close to home and yet we have been given no choice or support but to remain open and carry on."" Neil Leitch, chief executive of the Early Years Alliance, said: ""It is simply not acceptable that, at the height of a global pandemic, early years providers are being asked to work with no support, no protection and no clear evidence that is safe for them to do so. ""We know how vital access to early education and care is to many families, but it cannot be right to ask the early years workforce to put themselves at risk. That is why it is vital that the government takes the urgent steps needed to safeguard those working in the sector, particularly mass testing and priority access to vaccinations. Nursery providers are calling for staff to be tested, priority for vaccination and for state funding lost due to lower numbers during the pandemic, to be replaced by government. SYMPTOMS:What are they and how to guard against them? TESTING:How do I get a virus test? SUPPORT BUBBLES:What are they and who can be in yours? TEST AND TRACE:How does it work? Purnima Tanuku, chief Executive of National Day Nurseries Association, said nurseries were determined to support families during the current lockdown. But, she added: ""Time and again, whether it's on PPE, cleaning costs, testing or staffing, early years providers have been overlooked by the Department for Education. ""Now, they are the only part of the education sector fully open to all children and must be given priority."" On Wednesday, vaccines minister Nadim Zahawi said there was very little risk to younger children. ""The nursery sector has taken tremendous care in making sure the premises are also Covid safe. It is the right thing to do."" The Department for Education is yet to comment on the #ProtectEarlyYears demands. 'Very little' virus risk at nurseries - minister How long will nurseries stay open?
