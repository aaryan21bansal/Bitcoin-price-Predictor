" Who pays? By Alison Holt Over 10 months, a small team from the BBC’s Panorama programme documented the realities of how the care system is working in England. Based in Somerset, they followed the stories of people needing care and of the people trying to provide it. The pressures faced here are being felt across the country as the demand for help from an ageing population increases and local authorities struggle with tight finances. “I won't forget you,” whispers 87-year-old Jean Chapman to the care worker, who has leaned forward to hear her words more clearly. “I’ll miss you too,” the woman replies, reaching forward to hold Jean’s hand. Other staff kiss Jean goodbye as she is pushed in her wheelchair towards a waiting ambulance. Jean and her 96-year-old husband Owen are moving because their care home, where they have lived for a year, is closing. “It’s incredibly sad,” says their son-in-law, Nigel. “We thought we’d found the care home from heaven really with the support here, the carers here. We just hope and pray that this is going to be the last change for them.” Popham Court, an elegant cream-fronted building in Wellington, Somerset, is closing because it’s in need of modernisation but there isn’t the money to do it. According to the then chief executive of the not-for-profit company that ran it, council fees don’t cover the costs. “I’ve been on the board of Somerset Care for seven years,” says Jane Townson. “And at no point has the home not made a loss. We’ve been losing money for years and we’re talking hundreds of thousands of pounds.” Jean and Owen, who both have dementia, are heading to another home run by the company seven miles away. Over six months last year, at least 2,500 frail, elderly people in England had to move because their care home closed - a 39% rise on the same period in the previous year. It is one sign of the increasing pressures on a care system which is meant to look after some of the most vulnerable people in our society. Local authorities provide adult social care - support with day-to-day tasks like washing, dressing and medication either in a care home or in someone’s own home. To be eligible you have to show you have a significant need for help and in England you have to have savings and assets of less than £23,250. The care systems in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland operate in slightly different ways, but many of the pressures they face are the same. The ageing population means more people need help as they live longer with more complex conditions. In England, councils spend about £15bn a year from their own budgets on adult social care. In addition, they get some money from the NHS and many of those who qualify for council care have to make contributions to the cost. This brings the total amount local authorities spend on care services to around £21bn. But since 2010, councils in England have had the money they receive from central governmentcut by nearly half, as part of the government’s austerity measures. Some of that loss has been offset by increasing local taxes, but the amount they can spend on all the services they provide from fixing potholes to libraries to social care,has been cut by almost 30% during that time. A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson says it is “committed to ensuring everyone has access to the care and support they need, and have provided local authorities with access to up to £3.6bn more dedicated funding for adult social care this year and up to £3.9bn for next year"". The government says councils’ access to additional dedicated funding for adult social care is worth up to £3.6bn this year and will increase to £3.9bn in 2019/20. Even so, many councils say they remain under intense financial pressure. Last year, Jean and Owen’s local authority, Somerset County Council, came close to going bust. It had to make £13m worth of cuts to balance its books. Part of the problem has been overspending in areas such as children’s services, but the cuts are being made across the authority. Stephen Chandler, who runs adult social care in the county, has had to find £9m worth of savings from his budget of nearly £140m. In the year ahead, he must find another £4m of cuts. “It is really difficult,” says Stephen. “What I say to my staff is, think about what you would want for you, your loved ones.  But for me, I’m thinking about how am I going to afford that? We’re talking about costs that can be anything from £1,000 to £2,000, or £3,000 a week.” Stephen is in charge of providing care for about 6,500 people in Somerset and spending on adult social care takes nearly half of the council’s budget. In the months that we follow him and his team, it’s clear how heavily this complicated balancing act weighs on him. “We’ve become good at ensuring that our money is only spent on those people with the most complex of needs. We can do that for a little bit longer but not much longer."" Despite the growing demand for support, fewer people now qualify for council-funded care than did in 2010. This is partly because the financial threshold for receiving support hasn’t risen with inflation. Many, like Jean and Owen Chapman, spend years bouncing round what has become a very confusing system. Seven years ago, the Chapmans were struggling to cope and asked for council help. As they were living in the family home, its value was not included in the financial assessment and their savings were below the £23,250 threshold. It meant they got local authority help. When living in the house became unmanageable for them, they downsized to a flat. The extra money from the sale of the house meant their savings were taken above £23,250 and they had to fund their care privately, according to their daughter Helen. “That ticked along for quite a while until the amount of savings they had dropped to the minimum whereby they went back on to state care,” she says. Now they are both in residential care, the pattern is being repeated. The value of their home is now included in the council’s calculations, so it is being sold to pay for their care. “That money will then go into their bank account for use paying for the care home for as long as it lasts. When that is gone I assume they will go back to being state-funded again,” says Helen. But while they are self-funders, they will also be helping prop up the care system. Watch more on this story A 2017 report by the Competitions and Markets Authority estimated that on average self-funders paid £44,000 a year for a care home place - £12,000 more than the average paid by councils for a place. Jane Townson, who has now moved from Somerset Care to become chief executive of the United Kingdom Homecare Association, says that self-funders subsidising the lower fees paid by councils in care homes is endemic. “We completely disagree with this, as a matter of principle…. It is a national problem and it is wrong, but what can you do if you want to keep the whole care sector afloat?” Home care companies are more likely to focus either on state-funded clients or on self-funders. At their new care home, Lavender Court, Jean and Owen have rooms next to each other. Jean is wheeled into Owen’s room to sit with him. “I want to go home,” she says as she is hoisted into an armchair next to her husband. “You are in your new home and we are going to look after you,” the care worker reassures her. When we visit four months later they seem to have settled. Their daughter Helen and son-in-law, Nigel are pleased with the care they are getting. The couple’s flat has been sold and that will pay for their bills for about 10 months before it runs out. Then the council will take over the cost of their care again. Some care homes won’t accept the lower rate paid by councils – at the back of Nigel and Helen’s minds is the worry that the elderly couple could be asked to move again. Like many families they have found navigating the care system takes its toll. “It’s exhausting, are you exhausted?” says Nigel, turning to Helen. “It’s been a long haul,” she replies. “Not physical weariness, it’s the mental fatigue of trying to hold it all together. Making sure you are doing the right things for them at the right time.” Nigel says the current system is a mess. “Families need to know what to expect when they care for their relatives in the future,” he says. “How to access the care, how to access the funds and everything like that, and it is a worry and it won’t go away.” On 7 February, Owen died peacefully. It’s a beautiful sunny day in June and three little boys are playing on their trampoline. Their father ducks below the level of the trampoline, out of their sight. There are shrieks of joy as he suddenly reappears. The sound of the fun drifts into the house, where their mother sits in an armchair, her arms and legs heavily strapped. Martine Evans is 37 and has idiopathic juvenile arthritis.  Movement has become increasingly painful for her, making it impossible for her to join her husband, David, and their three-year-old triplets in the games being played in the garden. Martine’s health began to deteriorate soon after giving birth. “About six months after they were born, my arthritis just went haywire and every joint is now highly arthritic,” says Martine. “And I’ve also snapped a tendon, due to the arthritis.” Martine Evans Martine Evans This means she relies on David for nearly everything. Somerset County Council pays for a nanny to help with the boys some of the time, but David still has to juggle looking after them with working as a self-employed mechanic and caring for Martine. After months of doing this he is exhausted. “I’ve been awake hourly during the night some nights, sometimes more. I barely sleep at night, then I’m awake all day,” he says. “I knew there would be care needed at some point and for the rest of her life, but didn’t expect it quite so soon.” David Evans is Martine's husband and carer David Evans is Martine's husband and carer The couple have gone back to the council to ask for help with Martine’s care during the day and if possible at night. Sara Sharratt, an occupational therapist, who is part of the authority’s West Somerset social work team, is on her way to see them. A specialised bed has just been delivered to the family, which Sara hopes will make their lives easier. By pressing buttons on the hand control, Martine should be able to move herself a little. “I have ordered a profiling bed for her which would give her a bit of independence in terms of control,” says Sara. “She can sit up, get her feet up.” But when Sara arrives at Martine and David’s home, it quickly becomes clear that the bed isn’t doing what they need it to do. “I’m just getting folded like a sandwich,” says Martine as the bed raises her up.” Sara agrees it’s not working. She’s also worried when she sees David lifting Martine from the bed back to her armchair. “It’s the first time I’ve actually seen you do that physically,” she says to David. “Yeah, I’ve told you he is going to kill himself,” Martine responds. Sara nods, “Yes, it’s not just a simple lift. Right, I need to get a bed ASAP.” She will also get a hoist so David doesn’t have the strain of lifting Martine several times a day. Getting the right equipment is important because it allows the family to have more control over their own lives. It will also keep costs down for the council. “What is challenging for us as a council is to keep her at home,” says Sara later. “It is incredibly costly, or will be incredibly costly, but for her I think it’s really important that she stays at home just to maintain that family life, bring back a little bit of normality because I think at the minute those lines are all skewed. Her husband isn’t a husband, he’s a carer. It’s hard.” Nearly half of the money that local authorities currently spend on adult social care goes on younger people with disabilities. Over the 20 years to 2040 spending on this group is expected to more than double. Cases like Martine’s underline the pressures being faced by social work teams across the country as they juggle the needs of the people they are seeing, along with the squeeze on council budgets. Somerset’s financial problems mean all spending is closely scrutinised. The social work team is usually expected to keep the cost of packages of care provided in someone’s own home below a benchmark of £540 a week. That is what the authority would pay for a place in a residential home. Martine needs visits from carers four times a day. The cost of that, added to help with childcare, comes to more than £600 a week. For the moment, the help the family is desperate for at night is off the agenda. Chris Denovan leads the West Somerset social work team. She has the difficult job of balancing Martine’s need for support against all the other people needing help in her patch. She’s spent her working life in social care teams in the county and she exudes warmth as she talks about what they do. “I love it because I came into it wanting to make a difference. That passion has never gone away.” When I ask Chris how she felt when she was told there was a danger of the council going bust, her response is quick. “My first reaction was over my dead body…. because it is the last thing that I want to happen to Somerset.” But balancing the financial pressures and staff shortages with increasing demand for help has been extremely difficult. “This has been the toughest year of my working life,” she says. “And my service years have been over 40. We have had to make decisions that I have never had to make [before].” Chris has to get the spending on Martine’s case approved by her boss. She worries that if the cost of keeping Martine at home rises too much then they and the family may face a dilemma. “It is never our decision to say that someone has to go into a residential placement,” says Chris. “What we say is, this is the personal budget we can give you and it is of course for them as a family to make the decision how they spend that money.” Within three months, it is clear that Martine and David can’t go on without help at night. “David is absolutely exhausted which is terrible”, says Martine. “He doesn’t complain. He just carries on, he is amazing. He’s falling asleep on his feet, bless him. I just feel so guilty that I’m causing him this much sleep deprivation. We should be a team and working together and not me being a weak link all of the time.” David is sleeping on the floor beside Martine’s bed so he can be there as soon as she calls. “Drinks, painkillers, toilet, turning to make her comfortable, I can do that four-five times an hour in one night,"" says David. “You keep going for the things you love, I suppose.” By December, the council agrees to pay for a carer to come in two nights a week to give David the chance to sleep. This brings the cost of Martine’s care to more than £900 a week. The council has also applied to the NHS for funding for her care. When that is agreed, the number of nights of help the family get is increased to five. As Martine lies on her bed, the noise of family life surrounds her. Above, she can hear David getting the children bathed and changed. She finds it difficult not being able to help settle the boys for the night. For the family, coping with Martine’s deteriorating health has been hard enough without the added complication of trying to get enough support. When she reflects on their experience of the care system her thoughts are not about them, but about the people who’ve tried to help them. “Our social worker has gone out and fought tooth-and-nail for us to get that,” says Martine. “The social workers, the key workers, occupational therapists, everybody wants to help. And they are continually hamstrung by the budget.” For many people, the line between what the NHS will help with and what local authorities will do is a blur. That’s certainly what Rita McAllister’s family has found. “I don’t think you realise what goes on until you are involved in the system,” says Rita’s daughter, Siobhan Madden. Rita, 77, is sitting in her armchair watching the world out of her window. The other side of the glass, the streets of Taunton are set out in a patchwork before them. Rita has Parkinson’s disease and needs a lot of help. For a long time, she was cared for at home by her family. Siobhan gave up her job to look after Rita for six years, but as Rita’s health deteriorated they needed more help. At first, because of Rita’s very high needs, the NHS paid for her social care under a scheme called Continuing Health Care - the same scheme that eventually provided support for Martine Evans. The social care provided by the NHS is not means-tested and is only available for those assessed with the highest health needs. But many people don’t realise that.A recent poll for the Local Government Associationfound that 44% of people questioned believed that the NHS provides adult social care for everyone, not councils, and 28% thought generally social care was free. When someone does qualify for health-service-funded social care, they often find their budget is more generous than it is when they are supported by their council. Rita’s health seemed to improve with the level of support the NHS was providing and her family believed that because it was working well, it would continue.  But a year later in 2017, Rita’s case was reviewed. It was decided she no longer met the criteria for free NHS social care. Even though her family argued that it was the level of support she was getting that had stabilised her condition, NHS funding was withdrawn. This meant responsibility for her care now fell to Somerset County Council, but it wouldn’t pay for as much support. The family were already doing a lot of care. Now they had to fill in the gaps. “Obviously Siobhan was getting tired,” Rita’s son Sean says. “It was difficult for me because I was working full time. If I was staying the night I might be up for long periods, and then going straight to work. Over a period of time that becomes quite draining and difficult to manage.” Siobhan became ill and her mother’s health got worse too. Rita’s pain levels were increasingly hard to manage and eventually she ended up in hospital. From there, she was moved to a nursing home. Once again, the question of who will pay for her care is being discussed.  With Rita in a nursing home, the value of her home is now included in the council’s financial calculations. It means she is expected to sell the house she loves. Georgia Ayling, Rita’s social worker, has got to know the family well over the past few months. “Rita has very, very strongly said all the way through she doesn’t want to sell her home. It will be a situation she is forced into if funding comes back to the local authority,” says Georgia. “I can’t agree with it, but it is the way it is. There are no allowances for people, because everyone who has social care is in the same situation.” “They moved into this house in 1964,” says Siobhan standing in the kitchen of her mother’s home. “They were the first people to move in as a council house and eventually they bought it.” Lined up on top of a cupboard are teapots of all shapes, sizes and patterns. Siobhan and her brother Sean chuckle at the memories of how their Mum would welcome everyone into their home with the offer of a cup of tea and a chat. “Everyone would leave feeling better,” says Sean, smiling. Rita’s children accept the house may have to be sold, but say it will break their mother’s heart. “It is like being penalised, for being ill and seemingly doing the right thing for your family and buying your property.” “I appreciate care costs a lot of money,” says Sean, “but Mum did not ask to be where she is. It seems like a cop-out to say if you’ve got an illness that is progressive, that’s not going to get better, then you have to fund yourself.” The alternative is to once again apply to the NHS for Continuing Health Care funding. Social worker Georgia has been helping the family fill out the forms in what all of them find a complicated process. A photo of Rita as a young mother A photo of Rita as a young mother “Rita’s health is very, very complex,” says Georgia. “It’s an expensive package of care, with a lot of care going in because of Rita’s complex needs. I relied very heavily on the Parkinson's nurse to support the risk assessments and to give me the information about the support and care that Rita needed.” On a cold January day Georgia and Rita’s children arrive at the nursing home to meet a nurse assessor. She will go through a checklist to decide whether Rita’s needs meet their criteria. The meeting lasts a couple of hours. Georgia emerges from it feeling hopeful, but they won’t know the decision for several weeks. “I think that Rita should always have been health-funded,” she says. “But I don’t know, I simply can’t say what the outcome is going to be.” The information gathered by the assessor now goes to a panel which will decide whether or not Rita once again qualifies for NHS-funded care. Three weeks later, the family receive a letter telling them that the health service will pay for Rita’s care. It’s a relief, but the decision will be reviewed in three months. “What's going to change really in three months? It's a progressive disease,” says Siobhan as she and her brother sit at the table in the kitchen of their mother’s house. “She's not going to get any better. It's just ridiculous really. The whole system of what happens when you become this ill is horrendous really. It's so long-winded, it's so stressful for the family and for Mum.” “From what I’ve seen it seems to be a battle,” says Sean. “Health wants social care to pay, social care wants health to pay so you’ve got to go through these assessment processes to determine, is it health need?  Is it a social need? We’ve been through that and gone backwards again and gone through it again. Politicians need to realise the impact it does have on extended family.” Pat Lees laughs readily as she pushes a trolley around the supermarket. She leans on it to steady herself as she makes her way up and down the aisles of food, picking out the things she needs. It is October 2018, and Pat has just returned home after spending six months in hospital recuperating from two falls. John, a Red Cross volunteer, is alongside her, helping with her shopping. Pat spots a jar of instant coffee, which she asks him to reach. “There’s one at the front that looks bigger, but it’s probably my eyesight,” she says. She is waiting for a cataract operation and a patch covers her left eye. “No, they are the same,” John responds. She is one ofan increasing number of older people who live alone. Her nearest family and close friends are more than 200 miles away. “I’m hoping when we get to the end of the year and get my eye fixed and have proper glasses, that I shall be able to drive myself,” Pat says laughing. “I’m 84, but I’m still determined to get on with it properly.” John will see Pat about three times and once the sessions are over she’ll be largely on her own. The last thing she or the health service want is for her to end up back in hospital. In response to the pressures on the adult care system, the government has allowed local authorities to raise more money through council tax and provided extra short-terms funds. It’s often been targeted at getting people home from hospital to ease NHS pressures. But experts in the field say it doesn’t allow councils to invest in the sort of preventative services that can pick problems up before people reach the sort of crisis that takes them to hospital in the first place. In January 2019, we return to see Pat. The change from the woman walking determinedly around the supermarket is a shock. She speaks very quietly and is hard to hear. When she gets out of her chair to go to the kitchen she moves slowly, leaning much more heavily on her walking frame. She fell a few days before our visit. “I don’t want to fall,” she whispers. “It gets to a point where you are so off balance you actually do go down.” She points to the spot in the kitchen where she landed. “I just suddenly went. And of course, when you go, there’s nothing you can do. You have to just go and wait for help.” She pressed the emergency button on a cord around her neck and help came fairly quickly, but she is clearly shaken. Pat is paying for two one-hour visits from carers a week, but it isn’t enough. The charity, Age UK, estimates that there are 1.6 million people in the UK, who like Pat, don’t get enough help with their care. It estimates there are another 1.4 million people, who need support, but don’t get any. The danger is that people become increasingly isolated. Certainly, Pat would like more company. “Occasionally, I feel like I’d like to see somebody, there isn’t anybody who can come,” she says. “Mike, my neighbour, he died. It was terribly upsetting. I got on with Mike. We used to phone each other and chat.” In the three months since leaving hospital and that early support finished, Pat seems to have dropped off nearly everyone’s radar and be heading towards a crisis. With her permission, we contacted the council’s social care team to ask them to look at her situation. An appointment is made to see her and a couple of weeks later Hannah Croft, one of Somerset’s social workers, knocks on Pat’s door. It’s two in the afternoon and it takes a while for her to answer as she makes her way slowly and carefully along the hallway leaning on her walking frame. She’s still in her dressing gown. Hannah asks her how she is getting on with preparing her meals. “I do it myself, yes, it takes a bit of time.” Pat pauses for a minute, breathes heavily, then continues. “It wears me out.” “Do you feel that you need any support on a daily basis?” Hannah asks. “I doubt I’ll get that,” Pat replies. “I don’t think they do that kind of job.” Hannah reassures her that it will be possible to get help each day, the question is whether Pat will pay for it herself or whether the council will fund it. “Sorry to have to ask you this question,” says Hannah. “Do you have savings over £23,250?” “No,” Pat replies. It means that the council should pick up most of the bill for her care if her need for support is viewed as significant. Later that day, Hannah is back in her office filling in the forms asking for help for Pat. The next step is to discuss the request with colleagues. If they agree with her assessment that Pat has a significant need for support, then funding will be approved. “She inferred she could do so many things for herself and she wants to do so many things for herself,” Hannah says. “I would say that the evidence, the fact Pat was in her dressing gown in the middle of the day, indicates that maybe she needs just a little bit more support.” A few weeks later, Pat is being visited by care staff twice a day. Hannah has also asked for a colleague to look at whether there are local lunch clubs or other activities that Pat might be interested in. When we visit Pat again she is still frail, but pleased to be seeing people more often. “I think to have someone calling on you helps a lot,” she says. “I can tell you, if it wasn’t for these lifts there would be thousands more people in hospital,” says 74-year-old Alan Kinge as he presses the buttons to move an electric ceiling hoist along its tracks into position above his wife Val’s armchair, ready to lift her into a wheelchair. “She cannot live here without it. I can sometimes lift her three times a day, sometimes four.” Val Kinge has multiple sclerosis, and her husband Alan is her main carer. Val says they “muddle along”. The couple met in 1965 and married two years later. Alan proudly shows off photos of Val at 18, on their wedding day and one taken 18 years ago. They get two care visits a day, which are paid for by the council, but most of the time Alan copes on his own. He is one of about 5.5 million unpaid family carers in the UK. It’s been estimated that if you put a price tag on the informal care currently being provided, it would be worth somewhere between £57bn and a £100bn a year. But if there isn’t enough back-up for carers, it’s all too easy to reach the point where you can no longer cope.  “I had a scare about three years ago with heart problems,” Alan remembers. “The consultant’s report concluded I was technically all right with my heart. It was just sheer physical exhaustion. “When you are caring for someone, we’re not on an eight-hour day, we’re on a 24-hour day. Non-negotiable. You can’t walk away, you can’t think I’ve had enough, I’m going to chuck in my notice on a Friday. You just have to get on with it.” Research for the charity Carers UK shows that the impact on the economy as a whole is huge. It is estimated that one person in every seven in the workforce is caring for someone who is older, disabled or ill. Alan and Val like to get out as much as they can. On a sunny day, they often head to the coast. “You’ve got to go out. You’ve got to get away,” says Alan. “That’s the worst part about being disabled – being stuck at home.” Val agrees as he manoeuvres her wheelchair out of their adapted car and pushes her towards a picnic table that has stunning views of the sea and cliffs. Alan points to others out enjoying the good weather. Many, like them, are over the age of 65. “One of the problems of the future is people that retire like to move down here away from the hustle and bustle of cities. “You do need the help. It’s not an easy job,” he says, reflecting his worries about finding the care staff that he and Val rely on. “The carer system is breaking down bit by bit because there is just not the money,” he says. “They can’t get the staff, they won’t work for the wages, and the hours. I’m not for a minute suggesting that the companies are trying to employ people on the cheap. I just think that if the money is not there, the government is not paying this money, what can you do?” Successive governments have promised then failed to reform the funding of adult social care. Plans for the publication of the current government’s proposals, or green paper, have so far been delayed six times. The government says it will set out “plans to reform the social care system at the earliest opportunity to ensure it is sustainable for the future"". The lack of a long-term plan worries Somerset’s director of adult social care, Stephen Chandler. “The green paper has been delayed and delayed and delayed,” he says. “And we pride ourselves on prevention and early intervention, which needs us to be able to plan longer term.” Without a plan for the future he will continue to face really tough decisions. “This last year has been the hardest of my professional career, because I see ever more people for whom we are not providing the level and type of support that they want and need. Whilst we have improved a number of services, I’m conscious that has been at the cost of other services that people valued no longer being available.” Alan Kinge has a blunter message for politicians of all parties. “In the next 10 years, it is going to be a really serious problem. Ignore it at the moment if you want, but it is going to be there as sure as day follows night.”",Negative,6.614007e-17
"The road would have replaced the section of the M4 through Newport The Welsh Government will not build the Â£1.6bn M4 relief road, First Minister Mark Drakeford has decided. He axed the scheme because of its cost and impact on the environment. The plans would have seen a 14-mile motorway built as a gateway into south Wales in a bid to tackle the congestion faced by motorists around Newport. Welsh Secretary Alun Cairns said it was a ""dark day"" but Friends of the Earth welcomed the decision, saying it was ""great news for Wales and the planet"". Mr Drakeford's move to scrap the six-lane scheme follows a public inquiry overseen by planning inspector Bill Wadrup, who said the case for the road had been ""compelling"". Ministers had decided that, with austerity and Brexit in the background, the uncertainty of the financial position of the Welsh Government meant the project was too expensive. But Mark Drakeford said he would not have gone ahead even if it was affordable because of the impact on the Gwent Levels. Mr Cairns said: ""It appears that the first minister thinks he knows better than the independent inquiry.""

This was because he ""took a different view to the inspector on the impact of the relief road of environmental considerations around Gwent"", he said. Asked by BBC Wales if he was comfortable with breaking a manifesto pledge, he added: ""I'm comfortable that the circumstances that the promise was made in have altered."" In a statement to AMs, Mr Drakeford said there were ""no easy answers"" to the issue of congestion on the M4. He said he would set up a new ""expert commission"" to look at alternative solutions to solving traffic problems on the M4 around Newport. It will be guided by ministers' hopes for a ""high-quality"" integrated and low-carbon transport system, and have ""first call on the money that otherwise would have been set aside for the M4 relief road"", he said. The Welsh Government will also implement ""a series of fast-tracked"" measures ""to alleviate congestion on the M4 in south Wales"", including enhanced traffic officer patrols and live journey time information. Environmentalists have long-opposed the plans for the new motorway Newport Council leader, Labour's Debbie Wilcox, said the authority was ""disappointed"" with the outcome, but recognised ""this decision was always going to be a delicate balance"". There was concern from business lobby group CBI Wales. Its director Ian Price said: ""No problem has been solved today."" ""Congestion and road pollution around Newport can only increase. Economic growth will be stifled, confidence in the region will weaken and the cost of an eventual relief road will rise,"" he added. But Friends of the Earth Cymru directorÂ HafÂ Elgar said: ""This is a great news for Wales and the planet.Â Â ""As well as costing Welsh taxpayers over Â£2bn, this devastating road would have ploughed through the unique, wildlife-rich Gwent Levels, pumped more climate-wrecking emissions into our atmosphere, and ultimately caused even more congestion and air pollution."" The main proposal for a six-lane motorway south of Newport had been known as the black route -an alternative called the blue routewas proposed by its opponents, which would have meant an upgrade of the A48 in Newport, with new flyovers to improve the flow of traffic. Backers have said it would be cheaper.

""Welsh Government must move immediately to engage with business to give an assurance that it has some sort of plan B option and/or re-visit the blue route,"" a spokesman said. Carwyn Jones had intended to take the decision on the M4 relief road last year, but after delays the decision fell to Mr Drakeford. He said he had also been concerned about how affordable the scheme was. ""We were looking at something between Â£1.5bn-Â£1.6bn to Â£2bn,"" he said. ""To hear Mark say today it would have eaten into the roads budget would have been very difficult indeed. It would have meant projects would have had to be cancelled."" Costs had risen because of the UK's government intention to charge 20% VAT, as well as other factors such as inflation, Mr Jones said. Karis Jones said the rejection of the road was ""disappointing"" and ""frustrating"" Karis Jones is an associate solicitor who commutes to Cardiff and Newport from Monmouth every day. She said the rejection of the M4 relief road was ""disappointing"" and ""frustrating"". ""I would even have to consider potentially either moving to Cardiff, or potentially looking to move the other side, Bristol way, actually moving outside of Wales,"" she said.

""His decision means fewer growing businesses, fewer jobs, lower wages and less prosperity,"" Brexit Party group leader Mark Reckless added.

Mr Drakeford notes that the allocation of Welsh Government funds is beyond the scope of the public inquiry  - which begs the question: why did the Welsh Government commission a public inquiry that cost tens of millions of pounds, when the cabinet made the decision based on factors the inquiry could never consider? The answer to that is the change of leadership at the top of the Welsh Labour. Mark Drakeford was always cooler on the M4 relief road proposals than his predecessor, Carwyn Jones. Nevertheless today's decision marks an expensive U-turn on his party's 2016 manifesto commitment. For emphasis Mr Drakeford goes on to say that even if cost had not been an issue, he wouldn't have gone ahead because of the environmental impact. TheFuture Generations Commissioner,externalSophie Howe had been a prominent opponent of the project. She said it was a brave decision and the ""right one for people and planet"".

Rare birds, plants and insects have found a home on the Gwent Levels By Steffan Messenger, BBC Wales environment correspondent Today's announcement by the first minister is a huge win for environmentalists and others who have long campaigned to protect the Gwent Levels. It is striking that Mark Drakeford says he attaches ""very significant weight"" to the environmental concerns and would have rejected the plans even if the costs of building the new motorway were lower. It may not be the most famous of Wales' beauty spots, but the wetlands south of Newport have been compared by campaigners to the Amazon rainforest in terms of biodiversity. Rare birds, plants and insects have found a home here - especially in the unique drainage ditches known as reens - dug during Roman times. The first minister said the ""substantial adverse impact"" the plans would have had on nature could not be justified, contrary - we now know - to the conclusions of the public inquiry.

"GÃ©rard Depardieu at last year's Paris Book Fair French prosecutors have dropped an investigation into rape allegations made against actor GÃ©rard Depardieu. The 70-year-old had always denied the accusations, made by a young French actress last year. The prosecutor's office said the investigators were not able to stand up the allegations. Mr Depardieu is one of France's most recognisable actors, and has starred in films such as Cyrano de Bergerac and Jean de Florette. The accuser claimed the alleged crimes had occurred last Augustin one of Mr Depardieu's Paris residences when she was 22 years old, French media reported at the time. When the allegations emerged, Mr Depardieu's lawyer, HervÃ© Temime, said the actor was ""shaken"" and that the claims went against ""everything [the actor] is and respects"". In a statement, the prosecutor's office said: ""A number of investigations undertaken as part of this procedure have not enabled us to characterise the crimes alleged in all of their individual parts."" Mr Depardieu is one of France's most recognisable actors Able to combine bearish physicality with emotional delicacy on screen, Mr Depardieu has acted in some 170 films, getting his big break in 1973 with Les Valseuses (Going Places). He won the best actor award for Cyrano at Cannes in 1990, and was nominated for an Oscar for the same role. Green Card, an English-language comedy made the same year, brought him further acclaim outside the French-speaking world. Off-screen, he has made headlines in recent years for attacking French tax laws, moving to Belgium in protest and later developing close ties to Vladimir Putin's Russia.

"The road would have replaced the section of the M4 through Newport The Welsh Government will not build the Â£1.6bn M4 relief road, First Minister Mark Drakeford has decided. He axed the scheme because of its cost and impact on the environment. The plans would have seen a 14-mile motorway built as a gateway into south Wales in a bid to tackle the congestion faced by motorists around Newport. Welsh Secretary Alun Cairns said it was a ""dark day"" but Friends of the Earth welcomed the decision, saying it was ""great news for Wales and the planet"". Mr Drakeford's move to scrap the six-lane scheme follows a public inquiry overseen by planning inspector Bill Wadrup, who said the case for the road had been ""compelling"". Ministers had decided that, with austerity and Brexit in the background, the uncertainty of the financial position of the Welsh Government meant the project was too expensive. But Mark Drakeford said he would not have gone ahead even if it was affordable because of the impact on the Gwent Levels. Mr Cairns said: ""It appears that the first minister thinks he knows better than the independent inquiry."" This video can not be played Life on the coastal wetlands between Newport and the Severn estuary A commission will now look at alternative solutions to the problem of congestion on the M4 in Newport. Estimated costs stand at Â£1.6bn, a Welsh Government spokesman said - up on the Â£1.4bn previously quoted. Mr Drakeford's predecessor Carwyn Jones said he had seen estimates of up to Â£2bn. As it happened: Reaction to M4 relief road scrapping What do people living near the M4 think? Is there One Direction for Â£1.4bn road? It is the third time Welsh ministers have shelved plans for the M4 relief road. It had been supported by Carwyn Jones and breaks a Welsh Labour manifesto pledge from 2016. Newport West Labour AM Jayne Bryant said ""the decision condemns Newport to further decades of heavy congestion, idling traffic and toxic fumes"". At least Â£44m was spent by the Welsh Government on a public inquiry and other development costs. This video can not be played Why has the M4 relief road been axed? In a decision made in April and revealed on Tuesday cabinet ministers ruled they would not fund the scheme due to ""the financial position of the Welsh Government"" and ""the cost of the project"" Mark Drakeford said the Welsh Government's financial future is ""at a point of maximum uncertainty"" But the first minister said he also attached more weight than the inspector did to the effect on the environment Mr Drakeford said the project would have an ""adverse impact"" on the Gwent Levels's wildlife, its sites of special scientific interest and its historic landscape In his judgement the environmental concerns ""outweigh"" the road's advantages This video can not be played What is it like living next to the M4? Planning inspector Mr Wadrup, who has died since the end of the inquiry last year, had concluded there was a ""compelling case for the scheme to be implemented in order [to] relieve an acute problem on the strategic motorway network"". ""It is accordingly my view that the scheme is in the public interest,"" he said. ""The scheme would not, to my mind, have any disproportionate adverse impacts.""

We share a sacred responsibility to keep veteransâ stories alive, to recognize the cost of war, and honour their immeasurable sacrifices."" You can read the full statement here,external. Netherlands defence minister Ank Bijleveld has travelled to Normandy to honour Dutch forces who landed at Arromanches in August 1944.

"Thousands of people attended the 2018 event at Drumlanrig Castle in 2018 The Electric Fields music festival has been cancelled less than two months after it was moved from southern Scotland to a new venue in Glasgow. Metronomy, The Vaccines and Frank Turnerwere among the acts due to perform at the event between 4-6 July. Organisers announced in April that they weremoving the festival from Drumlanrig Castle in Dumfries and Galloway to SWG3 in Finnieston. However, on Tuesday they confirmed the event would not now go ahead. The announcement followed fans' complaints on social media, after attempts to buy tickets via the Electric Fields website were greeted with the message: ""This show has been cancelled"". Fans trying to buy tickets via the Electric Fields website were told the show was cancelled It included a Manchester-based number for the festival's ticketing company, Ticketline, for fans wishing to claim a refund. On Tuesday afternoon,Electric Fields posted a statement on their Facebook page,externalsaying it was ""with a heavy heart"" the festival had now been cancelled. It said: ""This decision has not come lightly and we have put in our all to try avoid this outcome, however we have been faced with challenges that we simply cannot overcome. ""As of today, Electric Fields ceases trading. For information on ticket refunds, please contact your location of purchase. ""We cannot thank you enough for your support over the years and we are truly sorry that we have not been able to make this work."" It continued: ""Never did we think the party we threw in a field in Thornhill for 100 of our friends would turn into a party for 7,000 in the grounds of a castle. Especially not in five short years. ""But it did, and that is thanks to all of you who came along and made it what it was."" One fan who had previously attended the festival but was given a refund last month after the switch to Glasgow explained why he had asked for his money back. Iain Kyle said: ""It was a great family weekend and it introduced the kids to some fantastic music they may otherwise not have experienced. ""The move to SWG3 just killed the whole vibe for me as it was no longer going to be time away and highly unlikely to be a similar atmosphere. ""It is a fairly congested market in Glasgow with TRNSMT and Summer Sessions already and they lost that family-friendly feature which made it so different."" Anger over Electric Fields move to Glasgow Electric Fields organisers in refund u-turn Electric Fields could return home In April, Electric Fields blamed ""ongoing logistical and transport challenges"" for the decision to leave Drumlanrig. SWG3 said that fans who had bought tickets for the event once it had been moved to Glasgow via the venue's ticket provider, Ticketweb, would receive refunds within 14-28 days. A spokeswoman for SWG3 added that this would apply to about 80 customers.

"Jack Letts, from Oxford, was dubbed ""Jihadi Jack"" after he travelled to Syria in 2014 The mother of a Muslim convert dubbed ""Jihadi Jack"" told a court she was ""horrified"" when he called to say he was in Syria. Sally Lane, 56, and her husband are accused of sending or trying to send her son Â£1,723, despite having reason to believe he had joined Islamic State. Jack Letts left his Oxford home at 18, married an Iraqi tribesman's daughter and moved to Syria, jurors have heard. Mrs Lane and John Letts, 58, deny three charges of funding terrorism. They are alleged to have ignored repeated warnings that they faced prosecution if they tried to help their son while he was in IS territory. Giving evidence at the Old Bailey, Mrs Lane told jurors her son had initially gone to Jordan and Kuwait for study and tourism. She said: ""He seemed like he was enjoying himself, relaxing and enjoying the country."" But on 2 September 2014, phone records showed a flurry of calls. Lane said: ""That was the day I found out. Jack phoned me. I was alone in the house. It was just a very quick phone call. He said 'Mum, I'm in Syria'. ""I was horrified. I screamed at him, 'How could you be so stupid? You will get killed. You will get beheaded'."" Organic farmer John Letts and former marketing officer Sally Lane deny funding terrorism Jack Letts, who is said to suffer from obsessive compulsive disorder, did not phone again until 24 September 2014. Mrs Lane said: ""He did not say exactly where he was. He tried to be reassuring, saying everything is fine. It's a civilian area, it's not a war zone."" Defence lawyer Tim Moloney QC asked: ""How did all that contact make you feel?"" She replied: ""We did not know whether he was alive or dead. At least we were reassured he was alive."" A month later, Mrs Lane attempted to use a Â£5,000 inheritance from her son's grandfather ""as a bribe"" to encourage him and his new wife Asmaa to get ""somewhere safe"". The trial continues.

"For any prime minister, handling a president like Donald Trump is like trying to hold on to a Ming vase walking across a recently polished, slippery parquet floor. He's a leader who glories in the unpredictable, who seems to wake up every morning wondering what controversy he can provoke, what headlines he can create. His reason for being is therefore from the start in contrast with the stiff choreography of a state visit. But No 10 will be relieved that the formalities with the PM today were free of mishap. And, as Theresa May readies herself for the exit, Donald Trump, who has definitely embarrassed her in the past, didn't repeat that habit today. Instead, he spoke warmly of her, suggesting that history may judge her much more kindly than the manner of her departure suggests. But some of the most notable remarks were not related to the prime minister in any case, but to what's next. Trump declines to meet 'negative' Corbyn UK will get 'phenomenal' trade deal Trump says May deserves 'credit' for Brexit efforts Whether you are overjoyed about Theresa May leaving or not, it is telling that the three names Donald Trump mentioned immediately when asked about the next leader were Boris Johnson, Jeremy Hunt, and Michael Gove, categorising them deliberately or not as the three most likely candidates to win the keys to No 10. All three have been invited to meet Donald Trump. You wouldn't expect the US president to invite the football team of candidates for the job to spend time with him on this visit. But it's notable that neither Sajid Javid nor Matt Hancock - both cabinet contenders - received invites to talk or to meet. Nor did one of the other Brexiteer frontrunners, Dominic Raab. Of course, smart candidates could even turn the lack of invitation to their advantage. Donald Trump won't of course have a say in this race and he is such a Marmite politician that chumming up to him is not necessarily an advantage for any of the wannabes. But the invite list does tell us something about the state of the race right now. And in the next 24 hours we'll see whom, beyond Nigel Farage, the president actually meets one-on-one. The other striking note was not about Theresa May either, even though, as her last big appearance alongside a foreign leader it was, in a way, a very grand leaving do. Instead, it was the Labour leader who featured. It's not exactly surprising that the two men would not be bosom buddies. Politically they have a greater distance between them than the width of the Atlantic. Mr Trump revealed not just (no real surprise) that he doesn't think much of Jeremy Corbyn, apt when Jeremy Corbyn doesn't think much of him either. He also revealed that Mr Corbyn had asked him to meet and that he, after considering his request, had decided not to do so. The Labour leader has always said that he is interested in dialogue. But his position does appear rather curious. Mr Corbyn chose very publicly not to attend the dinner for Mr Trump last night at the Queen's invitiation. He then led - very publicly - the protests against the president today. Yet we now know that he had actually asked for a meeting of his own, but was then rebuffed. Diplomacy, or the lack of it, can be a complicated business. We've learnt that from observing Donald Trump and Theresa May over the last few years. But those pitfalls won't disappear when the prime minister does. Now Jeremy Corbyn and the contenders for the Tory crown are all too aware of that.

"This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn said he wanted ""a dialogue"" with the president about building ""a better and more peaceful"" world Donald Trump has turned down a request from Jeremy Corbyn to meet during his state visit, calling Labour's leader ""somewhat of a negative force"". The US president said he had been approached by Mr Corbyn,who boycotted Monday's banquetheld in his honour. Explaining his refusal, Mr Trump said: ""I really don't like critics as much as I respect people who get things done."" Earlier, Mr Corbyn said Mr Trump's policies on immigration, human rights, trade and climate change were divisive. Speaking at a protest rally in Westminster, the Labour leader said he was ""very disappointed"" by Mr Trump's latest attack on London Mayor Sadiq Khan,whom the president called a ""stone cold loser"". But he told protesters he was prepared to have ""a dialogue"" with anybody about building a more peaceful, just world. Latest on Trump state visit UK will get 'phenomenal' trade deal Trump says May deserves 'credit' for Brexit efforts The Labour leadership confirmed they had sought a meeting with Mr Trump during his three-day visit to the UK and said Mr Corbyn remained ""ready to engage with the president on a range of issues, including the climate emergency, threats to peace and the refugee crisis"". Meanwhile, Mr Trump spoke by phone to former foreign secretary Boris Johnson - one of the favourites to succeed Theresa May - on Tuesday night and is due to meet rival candidate Michael Gove. He also had a private meeting with the Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage, one of the president's strongest political supporters in the UK. Mr Farage said afterwards it had been a ""good meeting"".

Asked about the snub to Mr Corbyn during a press conference with Theresa May, Mr Trump said he had ""never spoken"" to the leader of the opposition. ""He wanted to meet with me and I told him no,"" he said. ""I think that he is, from where I come from, somewhat of a negative force. I think people should look to do things correctly rather than criticise."" However, he later told Piers Morgan in an interview for Good Morning Britain that although it had been ""tough"" and ""probably inappropriate"" to meet Mr Corbyn on this occasion, he would have ""no problem"" with meeting him another time. While it is not mandatory for US presidents to meet opposition leaders and other non-government figures during state visits, it has been standard diplomatic practice. Barack Obama held talks with Ed Miliband in 2011 and also met David Cameron during his first visit to the UK as president in 2009. This video can not be played President Trump gives his opinion on three Tory leadership hopefuls In his speech, the Labour leader did not mention Mr Trump by name but did refer to ""our visitors"", and said all governments had a duty to oppose racism and misogyny. Mr Corbyn told demonstrators he wanted to have a ""conversation"" with the US president despite their multiple disagreements. ""I am absolutely not refusing to meet anybody. I want to be able to have that dialogue to bring about that better, more peaceful world that we all want to live in."" He appealed to Mr Trump to ""chase down"" all forms of racism, including Islamophobia, and take a more compassionate approach to the plight of refugees from war, religious persecution and the effects of climate change. ""Racism divides, exploitation of minorities divides, exploitation of minorities brings about hatred,"" he said. Mr Corbyn said he would oppose any post-Brexit trade deal with the US that allowed foreign companies ""in to take over the NHS"" - insisting he would defend a health service free at the point of use ""with every breath in his body"". But after holding talks with Mrs May, Mr Trump said no area could be excluded from future trade discussions, including the NHS. ""When you are dealing with trade, everything is on the table, so the NHS and anything else."" This prompted an immediate response from Health Secretary Matt Hancock, one of the leading candidates to succeed Mrs May in Downing Street, as well as other candidates. Allow Twitter content?

And Dominic Raab, who is also standing,tweeted that,externalthe NHS ""is not for sale to any country and never would be"" if he became prime minister. The BBC's political editor Laura Kuenssberg said the issue was now likely to be a factor in the leadership race. On Sunday, the US ambassador to the UK, Woody Johnson, told the BBC ""all things that are traded would be on the table"" - including healthcare. The SNP's Ian Blackford, who also addressed the anti-Trump demonstration, said Scotland must ""stand up for progressive values and against a damaging Tory-Trump trade deal"". The Welsh government said devolution must be respected and there was ""absolutely no prospect"" of the NHS being included in any post-Brexit negotiations. Mr Trump later told Good Morning Britain's Morgan that actually he did not see the NHS as being on the table. ""Somebody asked me a question today and I said everything's up for negotiation because everything is, but I don't see that being... that's something that I would not consider part of trade. That's not trade,"" he said. Analysis: By Hugh Pym, BBC Health editor There is nothing to stop American or any other foreign firms bidding for NHS contracts under current rules. The health reforms in England in 2012 required local commissioners to put large contracts out to tender.  A subsidiary of the US company United Health, along with British firms like Virgin and Circle, is among private groups which has won such contracts. Around 7% of the English health budget goes to private providers. There are different contracting arrangements in other parts of the UK. The head of NHS England, Simon Stevens, has called for new legislation to drop the requirement for health commissioners to put contracts out to tender. But if the government decides to do this it's not clear whether that might be overridden by the sort of trade deal Mr Trump would like to negotiate for the US. That's the suspicion of those who argue the NHS is vulnerable to covert privatisation. Asked about the Tory leadership hopefuls, the president said: ""I know Boris. I like him. I have liked him for a long time. I think he would do a very good job."" Referring to Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt, he continued: ""I know Jeremy, I think he would do a very good job."" On Mr Gove - to laughter from the audience - he added: ""I don't know Michael - would he do a good job Jeremy?"" Nigel Farage met Donald Trump after the president's press conference with Theresa May Mr Trump said he had only seen one ""very small protest"" on Tuesday, in contrast to what he claimed were the ""thousands of people"" on the streets welcoming him and his family. ""I heard there were protests so I said 'where are the protests?'... A lot of it is fake news, I hate to say.""

"This video can not be played Hong Kong is one of the few places in Chinese territory where an annual remembrance vigil can be held. Tens of thousands of people have gathered in Hong Kong to mark the 30th anniversary of the crackdown on protests in Beijing's Tiananmen Square. Hong Kong and Macau are the only places in Chinese territory where people can commemorate the activists killed in 1989. China has never given an official figure for how many people died, but estimates begin in the hundreds. Organisers say 180,000 people joined a vigil in the city's Victoria Park. But police put the number of attendees at under 40,000. In mainland China, the authorities have banned even oblique references to the crackdown, which took place after weeks of mass protests that were tolerated by the government. The numbers gathered in and around Tiananmen Square are estimated to have reached a peak of one million people. What were the Tiananmen Square protests about? Tiananmen: China's great act of 'forgettance' Hundreds of security personnel and police were monitoring the square in Beijing on Tuesday. by Grace Tsoi, BBC World Service, Hong Kong Hong Kong's Victoria Park is once again a sea of candlelight as far as the eye can see. The crowd, many dressed in black, is mostly silent whilst holding up their candles in mourning. Some are crying.  In between protest songs, they chant ""the people will not forget"". The crowd claps and cheers when Liane Lee - who took part in the 1989 protests - shouts: ""We refuse to forget. We refuse to believe the lies"". Standing watching is Teresa Chan. She has attended the commemoration every year since 1990, except once when she was ill. ""I wanted to go Beijing to be with the movement but I couldn't,"" she says. ""I never imagined it would end the way it did, it's very hard to forget."" But there are also new faces in the crowd this year. Protestor Teresa Chan has come to the protest in Hong Kong nearly every year Ms Leung, who is in her 30s, says she decided to come for the first time because she is worried about Hong Kong's future. ""I am very angry with what the Chinese government is doing here,"" she says. Amongst the remembrance flowers and candles, there are posters protesting against proposed amendments to laws concerning extraditions to mainland China. Many fear the changes will lead to the further erosion of civil liberties here in Hong Kong. Here in Victoria Park are also some mainland Chinese residents like Mr Zeng who travelled to Hong Kong with his wife and 11-year-old daughter just to attend tonight's event. His daughter says it's an eye-opening experience. ""I am here to learn the real history about China. Now I feel like China is no better than other countries,"" she says. This video can not be played Returning to Tiananmen Square for the first time The vigils in Hong Kong come at a sensitive time for its leadership, with public backlash over a proposed bill that would allow fugitives captured in the city to be extradited to mainland China. Smaller vigils are also expected 64km (40 miles) away in Macau's city centre, and on the self-governing island of Taiwan. The gatherings come at a sensitive time for Hong Kong's leadership The Tiananmen anniversary earlier prompted a war of words between Washington and Beijing. US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo criticised China's human rights record and called on it to finally reveal how many people died in the crackdown. In response, a Chinese embassy spokesman in Washington DC said his comments were ""an affront to the Chinese people"". On Tuesday, China issued separate travel warnings to its citizens travelling to the US, citing police harassment and crime. Its foreign ministry accused American law enforcement agencies of ""harassing"" Chinese citizens in the US through immigration checks and other methods. Pro-democracy protesters occupied Tiananmen Square in April 1989 and began the largest political demonstrations in communist China's history. They lasted six weeks. On the night of 3 June tanks moved in and troops opened fire, killing and injuring many unarmed people in and around Tiananmen Square. Afterwards the authorities claimed no-one had been shot dead in the square itself. Estimates of those killed in the crackdown range from a few hundred to several thousand. This video can not be played Wang Dan one of the leaders of the Tiananmen Square protests At the weekend, Chinese Defence Minister Wei Fenghe made a rare mention of the protests during a regional forum in Singapore. ""That incident was a political turbulence and the central government took measures to stop the turbulence, which is a correct policy,"" he said in response to a question. He added that because of the action the government took, ""China has enjoyed stability and development"". Tiananmen Square: What happened in the protests of 1989?

"Trade tensions between the US and China are weighing on global economic growth The global economy is weakening, according to a new assessment from the World Bank. The bank said it now expects growth of 2.6% for 2019 edging up to 2.7% the following year. The slowdown is widespread, according to the Bank's economists, affecting many countries. And there are risks to even this subdued outlook, including the uncertainty for business created by international trade tensions. One of the lead authors of the report, Franziska Ohnsorge, said the World Bank had warned in its previous forecasts six months ago of darkening skies. ""Then it was a forecast"" she told the BBC. ""But now we see it in the data."" US-China trade war in 300 words Why Californian wine will soon cost more in Beijing Is Vietnam the winner in US-China trade war? In January, the World Bank changed its outlook for 2019 from 3% growth to 2.9%. There has been a ""broad based disappointment"" affecting trade, investment and manufacturing and developed as well as emerging economies, Ms Ohnsorge said. Trade conflict has been an important factor behind the weaker growth, in particular the tension between the US and China. Between them, the two countries account for a third of global economic activity. Ms Ohnsorge said the uncertainty has an impact on investment by business It has been recurrent theme in the World Bank's analysis. China's growth is expected to continue to slow. In the three decades up to 2010 the annual average was 10%. The forecast for this year is 6.2% That partly reflects a deliberately encouraged slowdown which the Chinese government has sought to achieve, believing as most economists also do, that the earlier growth rate could not be sustained much longer. So far, it has been reasonably orderly and the ""hard landing"" that many feared has not materialised. But there is also an element of trade tension in the slower growth that China is expected to record this year. Global economic weakness has a key impact on the Bank's principal role: to promote economic development and the reduction of poverty. Africa's economy is growing but not enough to reduce poverty on the continent, said the World Bank David Malpass, who wasrecently named as president of the World Bank by Donald Trump, said ""Stronger economic growth is essential to reducing poverty and improving living standards."" Figures for Africa are particularly troublesome in his respect. Although the bank is forecasting somewhat stronger growth there this year than last - at 2.9% - it is still not enough to significantly reduce poverty on the continent.

"This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn said he wanted ""a dialogue"" with the president about building ""a better and more peaceful"" world Donald Trump has turned down a request from Jeremy Corbyn to meet during his state visit, calling Labour's leader ""somewhat of a negative force"". The US president said he had been approached by Mr Corbyn,who boycotted Monday's banquetheld in his honour. Explaining his refusal, Mr Trump said: ""I really don't like critics as much as I respect people who get things done."" Earlier, Mr Corbyn said Mr Trump's policies on immigration, human rights, trade and climate change were divisive. Speaking at a protest rally in Westminster, the Labour leader said he was ""very disappointed"" by Mr Trump's latest attack on London Mayor Sadiq Khan,whom the president called a ""stone cold loser"". But he told protesters he was prepared to have ""a dialogue"" with anybody about building a more peaceful, just world. Latest on Trump state visit UK will get 'phenomenal' trade deal Trump says May deserves 'credit' for Brexit efforts The Labour leadership confirmed they had sought a meeting with Mr Trump during his three-day visit to the UK and said Mr Corbyn remained ""ready to engage with the president on a range of issues, including the climate emergency, threats to peace and the refugee crisis"". Meanwhile, Mr Trump spoke by phone to former foreign secretary Boris Johnson - one of the favourites to succeed Theresa May - on Tuesday night and is due to meet rival candidate Michael Gove. He also had a private meeting with the Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage, one of the president's strongest political supporters in the UK. Mr Farage said afterwards it had been a ""good meeting"".

Asked about the snub to Mr Corbyn during a press conference with Theresa May, Mr Trump said he had ""never spoken"" to the leader of the opposition. ""He wanted to meet with me and I told him no,"" he said. ""I think that he is, from where I come from, somewhat of a negative force. I think people should look to do things correctly rather than criticise."" However, he later told Piers Morgan in an interview for Good Morning Britain that although it had been ""tough"" and ""probably inappropriate"" to meet Mr Corbyn on this occasion, he would have ""no problem"" with meeting him another time. While it is not mandatory for US presidents to meet opposition leaders and other non-government figures during state visits, it has been standard diplomatic practice. Barack Obama held talks with Ed Miliband in 2011 and also met David Cameron during his first visit to the UK as president in 2009. This video can not be played President Trump gives his opinion on three Tory leadership hopefuls In his speech, the Labour leader did not mention Mr Trump by name but did refer to ""our visitors"", and said all governments had a duty to oppose racism and misogyny. Mr Corbyn told demonstrators he wanted to have a ""conversation"" with the US president despite their multiple disagreements. ""I am absolutely not refusing to meet anybody. I want to be able to have that dialogue to bring about that better, more peaceful world that we all want to live in."" He appealed to Mr Trump to ""chase down"" all forms of racism, including Islamophobia, and take a more compassionate approach to the plight of refugees from war, religious persecution and the effects of climate change. ""Racism divides, exploitation of minorities divides, exploitation of minorities brings about hatred,"" he said. Mr Corbyn said he would oppose any post-Brexit trade deal with the US that allowed foreign companies ""in to take over the NHS"" - insisting he would defend a health service free at the point of use ""with every breath in his body"". But after holding talks with Mrs May, Mr Trump said no area could be excluded from future trade discussions, including the NHS. ""When you are dealing with trade, everything is on the table, so the NHS and anything else."" This prompted an immediate response from Health Secretary Matt Hancock, one of the leading candidates to succeed Mrs May in Downing Street, as well as other candidates. Allow Twitter content?

And Dominic Raab, who is also standing,tweeted that,externalthe NHS ""is not for sale to any country and never would be"" if he became prime minister. The BBC's political editor Laura Kuenssberg said the issue was now likely to be a factor in the leadership race. On Sunday, the US ambassador to the UK, Woody Johnson, told the BBC ""all things that are traded would be on the table"" - including healthcare. The SNP's Ian Blackford, who also addressed the anti-Trump demonstration, said Scotland must ""stand up for progressive values and against a damaging Tory-Trump trade deal"". The Welsh government said devolution must be respected and there was ""absolutely no prospect"" of the NHS being included in any post-Brexit negotiations. Mr Trump later told Good Morning Britain's Morgan that actually he did not see the NHS as being on the table. ""Somebody asked me a question today and I said everything's up for negotiation because everything is, but I don't see that being... that's something that I would not consider part of trade. That's not trade,"" he said. Analysis: By Hugh Pym, BBC Health editor There is nothing to stop American or any other foreign firms bidding for NHS contracts under current rules. The health reforms in England in 2012 required local commissioners to put large contracts out to tender.  A subsidiary of the US company United Health, along with British firms like Virgin and Circle, is among private groups which has won such contracts. Around 7% of the English health budget goes to private providers. There are different contracting arrangements in other parts of the UK. The head of NHS England, Simon Stevens, has called for new legislation to drop the requirement for health commissioners to put contracts out to tender. But if the government decides to do this it's not clear whether that might be overridden by the sort of trade deal Mr Trump would like to negotiate for the US. That's the suspicion of those who argue the NHS is vulnerable to covert privatisation. Asked about the Tory leadership hopefuls, the president said: ""I know Boris. I like him. I have liked him for a long time. I think he would do a very good job."" Referring to Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt, he continued: ""I know Jeremy, I think he would do a very good job."" On Mr Gove - to laughter from the audience - he added: ""I don't know Michael - would he do a good job Jeremy?"" Nigel Farage met Donald Trump after the president's press conference with Theresa May Mr Trump said he had only seen one ""very small protest"" on Tuesday, in contrast to what he claimed were the ""thousands of people"" on the streets welcoming him and his family. ""I heard there were protests so I said 'where are the protests?'... A lot of it is fake news, I hate to say.""

"Khuram Butt was being investigated by MI5 from 2015 The team investigating one of the 2017 London Bridge attackers was not told he had been reported to an anti-terror hotline, an inquest has heard. Khuram Butt's brother-in-law had reported his increasing radicalisation in September 2015. In the same month MI5 assessed Butt as wanting to stage a terror attack but lacking the ability to do so. Eight people were killed in the attack he carried out with two other men. They mowed down pedestrians on London Bridge before launching a knife attack in nearby Borough Market, injuring 48 others. Police shot and killed the attackers less than 10 minutes after the violence began. London Bridge attack: What happened Victims of the London Bridge attack Chances 'galore' to stop London Bridge attack A senior counter-terrorism officer - identified only as Witness M - told an inquest at the Old Bailey in London that it was ""very unsatisfactory"" his team was not informed about the call. Usman Darr had contacted the hotline because he was concerned that his brother-in-law had been distributing anti-Western texts and links to jihadi sites and had become increasingly extreme in his views. The information was processed but never passed on to the joint MI5 and police investigation of Butt that had been under way since mid-2015. In the same month that he was reported by his brother-in-law, Butt was assessed by the security service as having a ""strong risk"" of staging a terror attack on his own, but there was no evidence he was planning one. In May 2017 MI5 lowered the assessed risk of Butt carrying out a lone terror attack to moderate, but increased his ability to do so to moderate. Police decided not to charge him with possession of extremist material because there was not a strong enough chance of disrupting any potential terror plot, Witness M said. The inquest also heard Butt had associated with members of the banned terrorist group Al-Muhajiroun, including Siddhartha Dhar - who went on to fight for so-called Islamic State - andthe group's leader Anjem Choudary. The victims of the London Bridge attack clockwise from top left - Chrissy Archibald, James McMullan, Alexandre Pigeard, SÃ©bastien BÃ©langer, Ignacio EcheverrÃ­a, Xavier Thomas, Sara Zelenak, Kirsty Boden Witness M also told the inquest he had not personally been made aware that Butt had appeared in a Channel 4 programme called The Jihadi Next Door in January 2016, saying the programme was reviewed by another team. The court previously heard how Butt appeared in the programme - where he condemned the UK government, particularly over its actions in Iraq and Syria - for roughly two minutes but was not identified by name. Later that year, Butt was employed by London Underground, including working at Westminster station, but Witness M said he did not have grounds to intervene. In October 2016, Butt was arrested with three others on suspicion of falsely reporting fraudulent activity on three bank accounts, and bailed until January 2017. However, prosecutors advised there was not enough evidence to charge him. Witness M said police were also unaware of a number of pieces of information that indicated Butt was associated with the two other attackers. These included the fact they all met at Ummah Fitness Centre in Ilford, east London, that was itself run by a suspected senior member of Al-Muhajiroun, and that they went on regular trips together to take their children swimming. Last week, the lawyer representing several of the victims' familiestold the court there were ""opportunities galore"" to identify that the three men were plotting an attack. Xavier Thomas, 45, Christine Archibald, 30, Sara Zelenak, 21, Sebastien Belanger, 36, James McMullan, 32, Kirsty Boden, 28, Alexandre Pigeard, 26, and Ignacio Echeverria, 39, were all killed in the attack.

"Sir Philip Green has won the backing of the Pension Protection Fund (PPF) for his plan to rescue Arcadia ahead of a crucial vote on Wednesday. The owner of Topshop has struck a Â£385m deal to secure its pension schemes, including a Â£100m contribution from Lady Cristina Green, Sir Philip's wife and Arcadia's largest shareholder. The PPF said it would now ""vote in support"" of Arcadia's restructure. But the plan, which includes closing 50 stores, needs the backing of landlords. They would have to agree to a rent cut on Arcadia's stores, which also include Burton, Miss Selfridge, Dorothy Perkins and Wallis. Sir Philip Green's Arcadia facing crucial week Can Sir Philip Green save his retail empire? Sir Philip Green told to fund Arcadia's pension deficit The restructuring would be done through a company voluntary arrangement (CVA), an insolvency process that allows a business to reach an agreement with its creditors to pay off all or part of its debts. In a deal with The Pensions Regulator, trustees of Arcadia's pension schemes will be granted security over Â£210m worth of assets by the company, up from a previous offer of Â£185m. Lady Green will inject Â£100m into the schemes over three years. And Arcadia will make Â£75m worth of contributions to the company's pension schemes. Oliver Morley, chief executive of the PPF, said: ""We are pleased that the company and shareholder have agreed a funding and security package for the scheme. Based on this commitment, we will now vote in support of the Arcadia Group Limited CVA tomorrow."" But he added: ""While we are the largest creditor in this CVA, other creditors will also need to agree the terms for it to be successful."" Lady Cristina Green is Arcadia's largest shareholder and Sir Philip's wife Arcadia's chief executive Ian Grabiner, said: ""We hope that the landlords and other creditors will follow suit and we can get the company back on a strong footing in all the markets where we trade."" Consumer expert Kate Hardcastle said the pension deficit has been ""one of the biggest pressures""on Arcadia. ""It might change a few minds absolutely,"" she said. ""But I'd still say the result of the CVA vote is not certain. This will alleviate a lot of concerns, however."" Arcadia currently has more than 560 shops across the UK and Ireland, and employs 22,000 staff. It has already shut 200 of its UK stores over the past three years amid intensifying competition from a crop of more contemporary ""fast fashion"" retailers ranging from High Street chains such as Zara and H&M to pure online players like Asos. Arcadia has also faced the same problems as other bricks and mortar retailers, including rising business rates and labour costs, too many unprofitable stores and inflexible leases that make it hard to close failing shops. By Colletta Smith, BBC consumer affairs correspondent Philip Green's retail empire dressed a generation.

For many in an age group increasingly conscious about the impact of their spending, the teenage crush on Topshop is over. Ms Hardcastle said even if the rescue deal is passed, Arcadia will still have a lot more work to do. ""There is a lot of fat within the Arcadia group and it faces a lot of challenges.

"If Donald Trump had been inclined to wind down a bullet-proof window in The Beast as he passed through central London, he may well have wound it straight back up. The public were kept a long way from his motorcade but the boos were loud, the placards stark and the general message expletive-laden. And beyond that, in Parliament Square, under the gaze of a statue of a hunched Winston Churchill, British satire was on display. A Donald Trump baby blimp rocked back and forth in a light wind. A man was dressed as a caged gorilla with a Donald Trump face mask while his companion pulled off an impression of Boris Johnson - the MP who wants to be the next UK prime minister - dressed in a striped prison uniform. There were toilet rolls for sale bearing the president's face, sold for two for Â£5 from a couple of supermarket trolleys. A police officer went above and beyond to hand out Haribo sweets to his colleagues standing in a neat line along Whitehall. Above them, builders in hard hats watched events unfold from the scaffolding encasing Big Ben. It was all very British. Trump praises 'extraordinary' US-UK alliance In pictures: Trump's state visit to the UK Donald Trump state visit: All you need to know But it wasn't just the British who were there to protest. US holidaymakers gave up a day's sightseeing in the capital to let their president know what they thought of him. Jess Renner, and her mother, Lisa, from Nevada, say their president promotes division Nineteen-year-old student Jess Renner, who was too young to vote in the last US presidential election, headed down to the protest from her nearby hotel with her mum. ""It was fun to come and flip him off,"" she said. ""He's a bully and he's trying to bully you guys into buying all our stuff."" Fellow American Robert Kihm, from Denver, Colorado, said having Mr Trump for a president was no longer funny. ""It's embarrassing and ultimately frightening."" What's your message to him? ""Where do I start,"" he replied, in exasperation. ""Stop being authoritarian, respect the rule of law and stick to the norms for a US president,"" he urged. A group from Belgium on a three-day trip to London also couldn't resist having their say. ""He said Brussels was a hell-hole so we are also very against him,"" said Annelie Comeyne, from Ghent. Not everyone felt the same. A minority, including Lorraine Chapel, from Chiswick, in west London, was there to welcome the president. ""Love him or hate him, Mr Trump runs America and he is here by invite from the Queen,"" she said, waving her handmade sign. Lorraine Chapel says the president should be shown respect The blimp of a baby Donald was offensive, she said. ""Suppose they did that for the Queen in America"". In a flash, things turned rather ugly when a woman appeared next to Ms Chapel, accusing her in strongly-worded terms of supporting misogyny. Meanwhile, a heated exchange played out in the background as Trump supporters took on anti-Trump protesters before the debate veered back to domestic arguments around Brexit. A little later, the atmosphere lifted as speakers took to a temporary stage outside Downing Street where Mr Trump was holding talks with the outgoing Prime Minister Theresa May. ""Say it loud, say it clear,"" the speaker shouted over the microphone, as the rain kept falling. ""Donald Trump's not welcome here,"" the crowd hollered back, from under hoods and umbrellas. Some had their faces covered with #trumpstinks masks, others wore badges saying ""another nasty woman against Trump"". There was whooping and whistling as police officers cautiously managed the growing numbers, opening and closing routes. Melissa Branzburg gives her children a lesson in political activism Mothers with small children in buggies rubbed shoulders with seasoned protesters and American ex-pats. Melissa Branzburg, originally from Miami but now living in Greenwich, said President Trump has been talked about in her house for a long time. Her children - Isaac, five, and Ruth, three - would usually be doing crafts or playing in the park but today they were getting a lesson in political activism. They were keen to let Mr Trump know they didn't want him here in London, said Ms Branzburg. They asked a lot about children behind bars in the US, something she tried to explain in age-appropriate language. ""I want them to know they can make their voices heard and can see that other people agree with them,"" she added. Protesters delivered their messages on placards - some chose humour, others candour Florence Iwegbue, a dual US-British citizen, wore bright pink feathers in her hair and red, white and blue glitter on her cheek. She said she feared Britain might be following too closely in US footsteps. ""The message is not getting through that the way of life in America does not work,"" she said. ""In the US, you can't afford to be poor, sick, black or brown. This is becoming an issue in Britain - and it needs to be dialled back.""

"Theresa May's news conference with Donald Trump had an ""end of era"" feel to it. Only days before shestands down as the Conservatives' leader, the prime minister set out clear positions she hoped may survive her premiership. On Iran, the UK and US agree on the threat but disagree on the solution, and the US must ""do everything to avoid escalation which is in no-one's interest"". On China, she said both sides cannot ignore the threat to their interests, but they must also recognise the country's ""economic significance"" - a clear warning against a lasting US trade war with Beijing. On the transatlantic relationship, she emphasised she and the president were only ""the latest guardians of this precious and profound friendship"". In other words, she is going and so one day will he, and the relationship will endure. In a sentence Mr Trump could never repeat, she said: ""I have always believed that co-operation and compromise are the basis of strong alliances."" Trump praises 'extraordinary' US-UK alliance In pictures: Day two of Trump's UK state visit Donald Trump state visit: All you need to know As for the president, he kept the bombast to a minimum. On Britain's future relationship with the Chinese telecoms giant Huawei, he seemed reassured, saying ""we are going to be able to work out any differences"" and ""we will have no problem with that"". On Brexit, he was more supportive of Mrs May than in his weekend newspaper interviews, saying the prime minister ""has brought it to a very good point"" and ""she has done a very good job"". And on a future trade deal, the president generated headlines by confirming the NHS would be part of the negotiations. As for Jeremy Corbyn,the president said he had refused a request to meet the Labour leader, dismissing him as ""a negative force"", clearly believing this is not a man he is likely to have to work with any time soon. Yes, there were gags. The president teased Mrs May about not suing the EU during the Brexit talks. He also joked about who might be a suitable successor in Downing Street. But the mood was more low key than high drama.

"Wes Studi first caught the public's attention for his role in Dances with Wolves Nearly 50 years ago, Marlon Brando famously declined his Oscar for The Godfather over Hollywood's treatment of Native Americans. He sent Native American actor and activist Sacheen Littlefeather on stage to refuse the award on his behalf on stage at the 1973 ceremony. Allow YouTube content?

And it's taken a mere 46 years for a Native American actor to finally be honoured with an Oscar. Wes Studi has been given the honorary award for career achievement. Allow Twitter content?

Canadian native musician Buffy Sainte-Marie shared a best original song Oscar in 1982 but Studi's acting honour will be seen by many as a further step in the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences' continuing attempts to embrace diversity. In June last year,AMPAS invited 928 artists and executives to join- almost half of whom are women and over a third from minorities. This video can not be played What's happened since the the #OscarsSoWhite controversy of 2015 Oscars body acts to boost diversity Hollywood's complicated relationship with Native Americans goes back to the earliest movies set in the Wild West. Aside fromlargely ignoring the presence of black cowboys- they largely stuck to negative racist stereotypes of Native people, often portraying them as savage. Wes Studi's honour is 'long overdue' - Joy Porter, professor of Indigenous History at the University of Hull Wes spoke Tsalagi at last year's Oscars This is yet another sign of Native Americans on the up. It comes after unprecedented numbers of Native Americans ran for public office in 2018, a record number of them female. The Native population in the States is significantly younger than the average American and numbers are rising fast - more than five million identify as American Indian or Alaskan Native and about 78% are living off reservation. Of course, this award is long overdue, since Wes Studi has been working extremely hard at an exceptional level for a very long time - he's 71. He went to Chilocco Indian School, fought in Vietnam and overcame great odds to succeed. Studi played Magua in The Last of the Mohicans It's regrettable that to work in the mainstream he's had to be in some heavily stereotyped movies, such as Kevin Costner's Dances With Wolves (1990) and Last of the Mohicans (1992). Colonialism is full of ironies, and it's especially ironic in this case that the first Native Oscar goes to a man who has achieved success often playing an 'Indian chief', when in truth, in a great many Native communities, women often led and historically played key roles in diplomacy and war. The bottom line though is that Wes Studi is superbly talented and a credit to his Cherokee people. He spoke Tsalagi, his people's language, when he introduced a montage at the 2018 Oscars. He's a veteran who fought for his country, as so many other Natives have in all America's great conflicts - it's refreshing to see America recognise one of the very best. It's also suggested Hollywood often plundered real stories of minority cowboys as material for some of its films. Daniel Day Lewis (right) also starred in The Last of the Mohicans The Lone Ranger TV series is believed to have been inspired by Bass Reeves, a black lawman who used disguises, had a Native American sidekick and went through his whole career without being shot. More recently of course, the #OscarsSoWhite campaign, which began in 2015, highlighted the fact that there was not a single ethnic minority acting nominee for two years in a row. Studi (third-left) starred alongside Ben Stiller and Hank Azaria in the superhero spoof Mystery Men Since then, we've seen the likes of Black Panther, with a predominantly black cast, get a best picture nomination at the Oscars. Lion, Get Out, Hidden Figures and Moonlight have also figured, although it's impossible to know for sure if this is down tothe Academy's changes in 2016. Studi's other film credits include Geronimo: An American Legend and Avatar. More recently, he starred in TV hit Penny Dreadful. Meanwhile, filmmakers David Lynch and Lina Wertmuller will also receive honorary prizes at a Governors Awards ceremony in the US on 27 October.

"Over the past decade, smoking has become marginalised and stigmatised. From the smoking ban in 2007 to the introduction of plain packaging a decade later, everything has been done to discourage people from taking up the habit. And there are signs sugar is heading the same way. Sugary drinks are already taxed - and now a leading think tank has even suggested sweets, snacks and sugary drinks should be wrapped in plain packaging to make them less appealing, given the excess consumption of the sweet stuff. The call has been made by the Institute for Public Policy Research (IPPR) in a new report. IPPR director Tom Kibasi believes it could make a real difference. ""Plain packaging would help us all to make better choices and reduce the hassle of pester power for busy parents,"" he said. He wants to see it adopted alongside a range of other measures, including a ban on junk food advertising. That is something that has already been looked at by ministers. But would plain packaging be a step too far? Industry has been quick to object, with trade body the Food and Drink Federation arguing that branding is a ""fundamental commercial freedom"" and ""critical to competition"". The same sort of arguments were put forward by the tobacco industry, but successive governments have still increasingly shown an appetite to get tough. Interestingly, the government has not ruled the idea of plain packaging for sugar products entirely. Instead, the Department of Health and Social Care is saying it is waiting to hear what England's chief medical officer, Prof Dame Sally Davies, has to say. Why? There is a recognition that bold moves are needed if the ambition to halve the child obesity rate by 2030 is to be achieved. Dame Sally has been asked to review the steps that are being taken to ensure no stone is left unturned. In fact, she has already suggested that another measure floated by the IPPR -extending the tax on sugary drinks to other unhealthy foods - is a real option. And she is said to be open to the idea of plain packaging, which of course would be an even more radical step. All cigarettes must be sold in plain green packaging with health warnings But what is clear from the last decade is that the unlikely can soon become likely. During the early noughties, health campaigners and academic bodies were pushing and pushing for a ban on smoking in public places to be introduced. Time after time, the government poured cold water on the move. But then things slowly began to change once Patricia Hewitt became health secretary, paving the way for even more radical measures. The approach seems to be working - smoking rates have fallen by a third in just over 10 years. Some of the credit is clearly because of the growth of vaping as an alternative. But tough public health tactics have no doubt played some part. Evidence from Australia - the first nation to introduce plain packaging for tobacco products - suggests a quarter of the subsequent reduction in smoking rates could be attributed to the move. As the debate rages about obesity, expect to hear much more about the merits of radical action on sugar.

"This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn said he wanted ""a dialogue"" with the president about building ""a better and more peaceful"" world Donald Trump has turned down a request from Jeremy Corbyn to meet during his state visit, calling Labour's leader ""somewhat of a negative force"". The US president said he had been approached by Mr Corbyn,who boycotted Monday's banquetheld in his honour. Explaining his refusal, Mr Trump said: ""I really don't like critics as much as I respect people who get things done."" Earlier, Mr Corbyn said Mr Trump's policies on immigration, human rights, trade and climate change were divisive. Speaking at a protest rally in Westminster, the Labour leader said he was ""very disappointed"" by Mr Trump's latest attack on London Mayor Sadiq Khan,whom the president called a ""stone cold loser"". But he told protesters he was prepared to have ""a dialogue"" with anybody about building a more peaceful, just world. Latest on Trump state visit UK will get 'phenomenal' trade deal Trump says May deserves 'credit' for Brexit efforts The Labour leadership confirmed they had sought a meeting with Mr Trump during his three-day visit to the UK and said Mr Corbyn remained ""ready to engage with the president on a range of issues, including the climate emergency, threats to peace and the refugee crisis"". Meanwhile, Mr Trump spoke by phone to former foreign secretary Boris Johnson - one of the favourites to succeed Theresa May - on Tuesday night and is due to meet rival candidate Michael Gove. He also had a private meeting with the Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage, one of the president's strongest political supporters in the UK. Mr Farage said afterwards it had been a ""good meeting"".

Asked about the snub to Mr Corbyn during a press conference with Theresa May, Mr Trump said he had ""never spoken"" to the leader of the opposition. ""He wanted to meet with me and I told him no,"" he said. ""I think that he is, from where I come from, somewhat of a negative force. I think people should look to do things correctly rather than criticise."" However, he later told Piers Morgan in an interview for Good Morning Britain that although it had been ""tough"" and ""probably inappropriate"" to meet Mr Corbyn on this occasion, he would have ""no problem"" with meeting him another time. While it is not mandatory for US presidents to meet opposition leaders and other non-government figures during state visits, it has been standard diplomatic practice. Barack Obama held talks with Ed Miliband in 2011 and also met David Cameron during his first visit to the UK as president in 2009. This video can not be played President Trump gives his opinion on three Tory leadership hopefuls In his speech, the Labour leader did not mention Mr Trump by name but did refer to ""our visitors"", and said all governments had a duty to oppose racism and misogyny. Mr Corbyn told demonstrators he wanted to have a ""conversation"" with the US president despite their multiple disagreements. ""I am absolutely not refusing to meet anybody. I want to be able to have that dialogue to bring about that better, more peaceful world that we all want to live in."" He appealed to Mr Trump to ""chase down"" all forms of racism, including Islamophobia, and take a more compassionate approach to the plight of refugees from war, religious persecution and the effects of climate change. ""Racism divides, exploitation of minorities divides, exploitation of minorities brings about hatred,"" he said. Mr Corbyn said he would oppose any post-Brexit trade deal with the US that allowed foreign companies ""in to take over the NHS"" - insisting he would defend a health service free at the point of use ""with every breath in his body"". But after holding talks with Mrs May, Mr Trump said no area could be excluded from future trade discussions, including the NHS. ""When you are dealing with trade, everything is on the table, so the NHS and anything else."" This prompted an immediate response from Health Secretary Matt Hancock, one of the leading candidates to succeed Mrs May in Downing Street, as well as other candidates. Allow Twitter content?

And Dominic Raab, who is also standing,tweeted that,externalthe NHS ""is not for sale to any country and never would be"" if he became prime minister. The BBC's political editor Laura Kuenssberg said the issue was now likely to be a factor in the leadership race. On Sunday, the US ambassador to the UK, Woody Johnson, told the BBC ""all things that are traded would be on the table"" - including healthcare. The SNP's Ian Blackford, who also addressed the anti-Trump demonstration, said Scotland must ""stand up for progressive values and against a damaging Tory-Trump trade deal"". The Welsh government said devolution must be respected and there was ""absolutely no prospect"" of the NHS being included in any post-Brexit negotiations. Mr Trump later told Good Morning Britain's Morgan that actually he did not see the NHS as being on the table. ""Somebody asked me a question today and I said everything's up for negotiation because everything is, but I don't see that being... that's something that I would not consider part of trade. That's not trade,"" he said. Analysis: By Hugh Pym, BBC Health editor There is nothing to stop American or any other foreign firms bidding for NHS contracts under current rules. The health reforms in England in 2012 required local commissioners to put large contracts out to tender.  A subsidiary of the US company United Health, along with British firms like Virgin and Circle, is among private groups which has won such contracts. Around 7% of the English health budget goes to private providers. There are different contracting arrangements in other parts of the UK. The head of NHS England, Simon Stevens, has called for new legislation to drop the requirement for health commissioners to put contracts out to tender. But if the government decides to do this it's not clear whether that might be overridden by the sort of trade deal Mr Trump would like to negotiate for the US. That's the suspicion of those who argue the NHS is vulnerable to covert privatisation. Asked about the Tory leadership hopefuls, the president said: ""I know Boris. I like him. I have liked him for a long time. I think he would do a very good job."" Referring to Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt, he continued: ""I know Jeremy, I think he would do a very good job."" On Mr Gove - to laughter from the audience - he added: ""I don't know Michael - would he do a good job Jeremy?"" Nigel Farage met Donald Trump after the president's press conference with Theresa May Mr Trump said he had only seen one ""very small protest"" on Tuesday, in contrast to what he claimed were the ""thousands of people"" on the streets welcoming him and his family. ""I heard there were protests so I said 'where are the protests?'... A lot of it is fake news, I hate to say.""

"Khuram Butt was being investigated by MI5 from 2015 The team investigating one of the 2017 London Bridge attackers was not told he had been reported to an anti-terror hotline, an inquest has heard. Khuram Butt's brother-in-law had reported his increasing radicalisation in September 2015. In the same month MI5 assessed Butt as wanting to stage a terror attack but lacking the ability to do so. Eight people were killed in the attack he carried out with two other men. They mowed down pedestrians on London Bridge before launching a knife attack in nearby Borough Market, injuring 48 others. Police shot and killed the attackers less than 10 minutes after the violence began. London Bridge attack: What happened Victims of the London Bridge attack Chances 'galore' to stop London Bridge attack A senior counter-terrorism officer - identified only as Witness M - told an inquest at the Old Bailey in London that it was ""very unsatisfactory"" his team was not informed about the call. Usman Darr had contacted the hotline because he was concerned that his brother-in-law had been distributing anti-Western texts and links to jihadi sites and had become increasingly extreme in his views. The information was processed but never passed on to the joint MI5 and police investigation of Butt that had been under way since mid-2015. In the same month that he was reported by his brother-in-law, Butt was assessed by the security service as having a ""strong risk"" of staging a terror attack on his own, but there was no evidence he was planning one. In May 2017 MI5 lowered the assessed risk of Butt carrying out a lone terror attack to moderate, but increased his ability to do so to moderate. Police decided not to charge him with possession of extremist material because there was not a strong enough chance of disrupting any potential terror plot, Witness M said. The inquest also heard Butt had associated with members of the banned terrorist group Al-Muhajiroun, including Siddhartha Dhar - who went on to fight for so-called Islamic State - andthe group's leader Anjem Choudary. The victims of the London Bridge attack clockwise from top left - Chrissy Archibald, James McMullan, Alexandre Pigeard, SÃ©bastien BÃ©langer, Ignacio EcheverrÃ­a, Xavier Thomas, Sara Zelenak, Kirsty Boden Witness M also told the inquest he had not personally been made aware that Butt had appeared in a Channel 4 programme called The Jihadi Next Door in January 2016, saying the programme was reviewed by another team. The court previously heard how Butt appeared in the programme - where he condemned the UK government, particularly over its actions in Iraq and Syria - for roughly two minutes but was not identified by name. Later that year, Butt was employed by London Underground, including working at Westminster station, but Witness M said he did not have grounds to intervene. In October 2016, Butt was arrested with three others on suspicion of falsely reporting fraudulent activity on three bank accounts, and bailed until January 2017. However, prosecutors advised there was not enough evidence to charge him. Witness M said police were also unaware of a number of pieces of information that indicated Butt was associated with the two other attackers. These included the fact they all met at Ummah Fitness Centre in Ilford, east London, that was itself run by a suspected senior member of Al-Muhajiroun, and that they went on regular trips together to take their children swimming. Last week, the lawyer representing several of the victims' familiestold the court there were ""opportunities galore"" to identify that the three men were plotting an attack. Xavier Thomas, 45, Christine Archibald, 30, Sara Zelenak, 21, Sebastien Belanger, 36, James McMullan, 32, Kirsty Boden, 28, Alexandre Pigeard, 26, and Ignacio Echeverria, 39, were all killed in the attack.

President Donald Trump has praised the ""eternal friendship"" between the UK and US as he joined a state banquet at Buckingham Palace. The Queen said the countries were celebrating an alliance which had ensured the ""safety and prosperity of both our peoples for decades"". The president is in the UK for a three-day state visit, which includes the 75th anniversary of the D-Day landings. Earlier in the day,Mr Trump criticised the mayor of London. Hetweeted that Sadiq Khan,external- who had saidthe UK should ""not roll out the red carpet"",externalfor Mr Trump - was a ""stone cold loser"". But in his speech at the banquet, Mr Trump praised the courage of the British people during World War Two and called the Queen a ""great, great woman"". ""In that dark hour, the people of this nation showed the world what it means to be British,"" he said, adding that their bravery ensured that the destiny of the country ""remained in your own hands"". Mr Trump ended his speech with a toast to ""the eternal friendship of our people, the vitality of our nations and to the long-cherished and truly remarkable reign of Her Majesty the Queen"". The Queen praised the two countries' role in creating an assembly of international institutions that would ensure ""the horrors of conflict would never be repeated"". On Twitter before the banquet, Mr Trumppraised the welcome,externalfrom the Royal Family as ""fantastic"" and said the relationship with the UK is ""very strong"".

Large-scale protests are planned in several UK cities during the three-day visit, including in London, where a ""national demonstration"" will start at Trafalgar Square at 11:00 on Tuesday. The Duchess of Cambridge was escorted into the banquet by US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin The banquet was held in the ballroom at Buckingham Palace The American national anthem was played and Mr Trump was invited to inspect the guard of honour Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn - who boycotted the state dinner - is due to attend and speak at the London demonstration, a party spokesman has confirmed. Earlier,Mr Corbyn tweeted,external: ""Tomorrow's protest against Donald Trump's state visit is an opportunity to stand in solidarity with those he's attacked in America, around the world and in our own country - including, just this morning, Sadiq Khan."" Mr Trump's tweet about Mr Khan accused him of doing a ""terrible job"" as mayor, adding: ""[He] has been foolishly ""nasty"" to the visiting president of the United States, by far the most important ally of the United Kingdom. He is a stone cold loser who should focus on crime in London, not me."" By James Landale, BBC diplomatic correspondent The contrast could not have been starker. The President of the United States received a warm welcome from the Queen and the Prince of Wales at Buckingham Palace. There were two 41-gun salutes - one for Mr Trump and another marking the 66th anniversary of the Queen's coronation on Sunday - as well as an honour guard of young Grenadiers resplendent in scarlet. At the same time, Mr Trump launched a verbal attack on the mayor of the city in which he is now a guest, calling Sadiq Khan ""a stone cold loser"" for questioning why the president had been granted a state visit. In truth, this is all of a piece for Mr Trump: he gets the pictures and the pageantry that he wants and will look good in his re-election campaign next year, and he gets to pick a fight with a liberal, Muslim politician that will play well with his base. Already this row is forcing those campaigning to be Britain's prime minister to define themselves against Mr Trump. Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt criticised Mr Khan for his ""great discourtesy"". But Health Secretary Matt Hancock said the office of the mayor of London should be respected in the same way one respects the office of the president. This visit has only just begun and already the Great Disruptor is tweeting angry thoughts and breaching diplomatic niceties. Business as usual, you might think - only today he also happens to be a guest of the Queen, who rarely tweets and is always diplomatic. A spokesman for Mr Khan said ""childish insults"" should be beneath the US president, adding: ""Sadiq is representing the progressive values of London and our country, warning that Donald Trump is the most egregious example of a growing far-right threat around the globe."" House of Commons Speaker John Bercow and Liberal Democrat leader Sir Vince Cable also boycotted the state banquet. Trump's visit: A barometer of political power Trump denies calling Meghan Markle 'nasty' Trump visit divides crowds at the palace The Duchess of Sussex did not attend following the birth of her son Archie, who is less than a month old. On Sunday, Mr Trumpdenied calling the duchess ""nasty"", despite him using the word on tape.

Tory leadership candidate Mr Hunt, who has spoken about the importance of the UK's relationship with the US, said Mr Trump mentioned to him ""some of his very strong views about the mayor of London"". Crowds were gathered outside Buckingham Palace as the president and first lady landed by helicopter shortly after midday. This video can not be played Trump shakes the Queen's hand The Queen presented Mr Trump with a first edition of Sir Winston Churchill's book The Second World War, from 1959, with gilt decorations and hand-sewn bindings in the colours of the US flag. He was also given a three-piece Duofold pen set decorated with an EIIR emblem, in a design made exclusively for the monarch. Mrs Trump received a specially commissioned silver box with a handcrafted enamel lid, decorated in royal blue with roses, thistles and shamrocks to represent the ceiling of Buckingham Palace's music room. After the private lunch, the Queen showed the couple American artefacts and other items from the Royal Collection. In a nod to the US leader's Scottish heritage, he was shown a bolt of Harris tweed.

The president signed the distinguished visitor's book in his customary black marker pen, describing the 13th Century church as a ""special place"". Their next stop was Clarence House, where they joined Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall for tea. By Hamish Mackay, BBC News A quick walk around the crowd outside Buckingham Palace revealed the presence of supporters and detractors of Mr Trump - both equally strong in their views. Phillip Butah, from Essex, wearing a MAGA hat and describing himself and his companion as ""Trump activists"", says: ""We are so happy that he's here - this visit is long overdue."" Asked what they expect the UK to get from this visit, they reply: ""Trade deals."" Corey Wright, a 25-year-old American from Ohio, in London as a tourist, sees the visit in a similar light. ""I think the visit is good for the political environment,"" he says. ""I think that needs to be worked on and that's what he's here to do."" Auriel Granville - a climate activist from Wimbledon, south-west London - came dressed as the Statue of Liberty to protest against the president's visit. ""I don't think he should be received in this way - climate change should be top of our agenda and Donald Trump is a climate change denier,"" she said.

Although Mr Trump has spoken of his admiration for Mrs May, there are expected to be differences of opinion during their talks.

"The inflatable depicting Donald Trump as a baby has been flown over Parliament Square again as part of demonstrations against the US president. Some people say it is a legitimate protest against a US president with controversial policies, while others argue it is disrespectful to a democratically elected ally of the UK with whom the government hopes to agree a free-trade deal. The protesters got permission for the helium-filled 6m (19.7ft) high balloon to fly again over Parliament Square Gardens. It was cleared by the City Operations Unit at City Hall, where the Mayor of London is based. The group needed permission from the unit because Parliament Square Gardens is controlled by the Greater London Authority (GLA).You need permission,externalto do a whole range of things there, including holding a public gathering or standing on your own with a placard. Applicants have to show that they have sufficient insurance and there has to be a full risk assessment. The GLA told Reality Check that it's not its role to act as a censor, or decide what is or isn't a good protest. But it says it does work with the Metropolitan Police to reject anything containing illegal content, such as anything racist or homophobic. The Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) does not need to give its permission because the inflatable has been flying below 60m. But a CAA spokesperson said: ""Anyone flying a tethered balloon below 60m may, however, still require permission from air traffic control if operated within 'controlled airspace', such as over Central London."" The air traffic control provider Nats confirmed that the balloon would count as a non-standard flight in controlled airspace.

"State visits are impressive, intensely choreographed and downright strange affairs. They are often notable for what goes wrong - did a visiting president break protocol by addressing one of the royals incorrectly? Did a soldier with a bearskin hat faint in the heat while on parade? God forbid anyone used the wrong golden fork at the state dinner. Whether or not in the next few days it is revealed that one of the Trump offspring took a selfie with the corgis, or the Duchess of Cambridge let Melania Trump try on her tiara in the Ladies, strip away all the excess and it's really about an expression of power. In the next couple of days, we'll see an important marking of the passage of time since decisive days in World War Two. There will be tributes to the bravery and sacrifice of the Allied forces, and restatements of the US and the UK's commitment to a relationship that is vital for both, and will endure. But the political cast, as ever, has a great bearing on how well the relationship between the UK and the US can work. Trump praises 'common values' at state banquet Five potential diplomatic flashpoints PM to challenge Trump on climate Joint appearances by Theresa May and Donald Trump have been outwardly at least, extremely awkward. That's in part because he has the habit of giving his unvarnished view of her government before he touches down, splashing controversy around in the way he so clearly enjoys. It's also been because the contrast between them is just so profound. He, the tycoon who seems to adore breaking the political rules, who vaulted his way to the Oval Office taking the US establishment by surprise. She, the careful politician who gradually inched her way upwards through the machine of the political party she loves and hoped to protect. Mr Trump, who relishes baiting those who disagree with him, and taunting the media. Mrs May, who gives the impression she would rather be left alone with her red boxes. This time that difference is all the greater because the prime minister is on her way out of the door, while the president seeks another term in office. They will have some discussions on Tuesday certainly. No 10 is expected to urge the White House to take climate change more seriously, and to think carefully about its approach to Iran. In the other direction, expect the US to raise concerns over involving the Chinese telecoms firm Huawei in developing British infrastructure, and of course, the tentative conversations there have already been about trading after Brexit are likely to continue. But don't expect dramatic joint announcements on Tuesday. If the political outcomes are a barometer of power, the truth is that Theresa May's is fading - with the US and Donald Trump having at least half an eye on who is coming next.

"Konta had not won a match at Roland Garros before this year 2019 French Open Venue:Roland Garros, ParisDates:26 May-9 June Coverage:Live text and radio commentary on the BBC Sport website and app. Johanna Konta's extraordinary French Open continued as she beat Sloane Stephens to become the first British woman since 1983 to reach the semi-finals at Roland Garros. The British number one, seeded 26th, played near-perfect tennis in a 6-1 6-4 win over the American seventh seed. Konta, 28, broke serve three times and dropped just 13 points on her serve. She will play unseeded Czech teenager Marketa Vondrousova in the last four on Thursday in Paris. Konta will be playing in her third Grand Slam semi-final - on a third different surface - after runs to the same stage at the 2016 Australian Open and Wimbledon in 2017. And she will look to go one better than Jo Durie - the last Briton to reach the women's semi-finals 36 years ago - by reaching Saturday's final. ""To play on the new Chatrier court against a top player and at the level I did, I'm really proud of myself,"" said Konta. ""It's hard to say if it was one of the best matches of my career, but dealing with conditions out here and against an opponent like Sloane who can run away with it, I was pleased to get her on the back foot and control the points a little bit."" 'Definitely one of my best performances', says Konta Federer sets up semi-final with Nadal Live scores, schedule and results Nineteen-year-old Vondrousova overcame her second-set nerves to close out a 7-6 (7-1) 7-5 victory over Croatian 31st seed Petra Martic. The left-hander is a fast-rising star of the game. She won her first WTA title at 17, in just her second Tour-level event. She has won more matches than any other female player since this year's Australian Open, including victories over big names such as Simona Halep and Jelena Ostapenko, and is yet to drop a set on her way to the last four. However, Konta had a three-set victory in the Rome quarter-finals last month. ""It is going to be very tough, I just can't wait to play again,"" Vondrousova said after her win. Konta's resurgence on the clay has been one which few people would have predicted at the start of the clay season, when she was ranked 47th in the world. The former world number four has shown her pedigree on grass and hard surfaces, but had never won a main-draw match on the Paris clay until this year. Signs of her improved fortunes were evident as she reached two WTA finals at the Morocco Open and Italian Open - and that form has continued at Roland Garros. Now she has won 15 matches on the surface in 2019, meaning only Martic stands alongside her in terms of clay-court victories on the tour this year. Linking up with new coach Dimitri Zavialoff at the end of last year has paid dividends, Konta once again showing increased trust in her ability to cause opponents problems with her hard-hitting game. Yet, although Konta's confidence has been evident throughout the tournament, the manner of this 71-minute victory against someone of Stephens' pedigree left those on half-full Chatrier murmuring with surprise. Stephens, who won the 2017 US Open as well as reaching the final here last year, was rated as the favourite coming into Tuesday's quarter-final, with former Grand Slam champions Martina Navratilova and Lindsay Davenport backing the American. Konta came under immediate pressure in the opening game of the match, needing to see off a break point and come through a lengthy deuce to hold serve after eight minutes. That proved pivotal as Konta swatted her lacklustre opponent aside from then on. The Briton's aggressive approach did the damage as she ended up hitting 25 winners and six aces on her way to taking 87% of first-serve points. Stephens, usually nimble around the court, had no answers to Konta's power and precision. Konta broke Stephens' serve for a 3-1 lead, claiming the next three games to win the opening set in just 33 minutes. She continued to dominate in the second set, not dropping a point on serve until she produced a double fault in the final game. By that time it mattered little, the Briton resetting to take victory when Stephens pushed a return inches wide of the line. Perhaps a sign of Konta's renewed belief was evident in her relatively understated celebration: a simple turn to her coach Zavialoff and boyfriend Jackson Wade wearing a wide grin, before raising both arms aloft as she took the acclaim of the crowd. Konta's path to the latter stages - and a potential chance to become the first Briton to win Roland Garros since Sue Barker in 1976 - has opened up following an unpredictable women's tournament. After beating Stephens, Konta will face an opponent in Vondrousova who, like the Briton, reached the Roland Garros quarter-finals for the first time. Stephens was one of only three top-10 seeded players to make the women's quarter-finals, along with Romania's defending champion Halep and Australian eighth seed Ashleigh Barty. Former world number one Halep and Barty will meet in the other semi-final - if they beat 17-year-old American Amanda Anisimova and 14th seed Madison Keys respectively in their quarter-finals on Wednesday. BBC tennis correspondent Russell Fuller:""The entire performance was breathtaking. Everything about Konta's performance was majestic. Sloane Stephens could do nothing on Konta's serve. She had the stuffing knocked out of her. That's the best I have ever seen Konta play."" Former world number five Daniela Hantuchova for BBC Radio 5 Live:""Konta couldn't ask for a better match and if she keeps playing like this I don't see anyone that can stop her. Simona Halep was my pick to win the trophy before the tournament but the way Johanna played it will be really interesting."" Radio 5 Live tennis commentator Naomi Cavaday:""I felt for sure every set would be tight and ultra-competitive but Johanna was too good for Stephens. I think Konta can take out Halep if she plays like that. That was phenomenal.""

"First Minister Mark Drakeford rejects a proposed new Â£1.4bn motorway in south Wales He has published a public inquiry inspector's report which backed the scheme to ease congestion around Newport However, Mr Drakeford revealed the cabinet decided in April the project was unaffordable 'Substantial adverse impacts' on the Gwent Levels wildlife habitat were also a factor, he added Andy Roberts, Steve Duffy and Ruth Thomas The discussion in the Senedd of the Welsh Government's decision to scrap the proposed M4 relief road has ended, so we'll draw our live coverage to a close too - thanks for joining us. There will be more reporting, reaction and analysis on the website and on all other BBC Cymru Wales news services as the day progresses. One business next to the M4 was happy that the relief road had been abandoned. Roadchef, which runs Magor services in Monmouthshire, had warned it could lead to an80% drop in westbound custombecause motorists would have faced a detour. It had given evidence to the public inquiry, warning it could even lead to drivers falling asleep at the wheel if they waited too long to take a break. Simon Turl, chairman, added: ""In light of todayâs decision, Roadchef is looking forward to working with the Welsh Government to release vital investment at Magor which has up until now been on hold"". Anita Watts, of Pant Road in Newport, has lived close to the motorway for more than 39 years. âIt has got noisier over the years since weâve been here.
Otherwise I think you learn to live with it. ""I think itâs the wrong decision in
some ways. We do need the new M4 relief because of the businesses
in Wales. ""Iâm sure they could have done a different design further down the line
that would miss the wetlands out. I think they need to go back to the drawing
board and have another look.â The Woodland Trust said four ancient woodlands would have been threatened by the building of the M4 relief road. âOne of our priorities is protecting ancient woodlands under threat and the irreplaceable biodiversity that they support, said Natalie Buttriss, the charity's director in Wales. ""We currently have around 70 cases of ancient woods under threat in Wales. ""I sincerely hope therefore that now, with the rejection of the proposed âblack routeâ..a change of direction has been initiated which rejects all unsustainable road development and reduces the over-riding threat to our precious woodland habitats.â The Woodland Trust said this ancient woodland at Coed Kernew was under threat Vaughan RoderickBBC Welsh Affairs Editor It had become clear over the past few days that the plans
for an M4 relief road were heading for the scrapyard. U-turns arenât 
normally allowed on motorways. This case is the exception, it appears. Mark Drakeford insisted that todayâs decision was the result
of a changed financial and political context. Part of that change of context
though is a change of first minister. We donât know whether Carwyn Jones would have given the plan
the go-ahead had he taken the decision himself, as heâd intended. Many suspect
that the former first minister regarded the relief road as part of his legacy.
If so, today will have been a disappointment for him. All of which, of course, leaves the people of Newport
dealing with the worst congestion problems in Wales with all the
inconvenience and pollution that go with that. That congestion isnât
confined to the M4 though.  Newportonians will be hoping that any future
measures take in not just the motorway but the A467, the A4042 and the
frequently gridlocked city centre. Rick Dempsey who lives on Pant Road in Newport near the M4. âI personally wouldnât like to see them build through the
level, it would cause too much irreparable damage...but I see this motorway at
a standstill most mornings, especially westbound, so somethingâs got to be
done. What? I donât know.â According to First Minister Mark Drakeford, these are some of the ""fast-tracked, targeted interventions"" we might now see to reduce congestion on the M4 in south Wales: Newport East AM John Griffiths said he supported the decision to scrap the M4 relief road project, unlike the Newport West AM Jayne Bryant. He said they agreed on the scale of the congestion problem but disagreed on the solution. Mr Griffiths described the Gwent Levels as a ""unique and historic environment"". The value of that habitat and a climate emergency required ""new thinking, more imagination and new ways of approaching these problems"", he added. The AM urged ministers to work with local communities, such as the people of Magor and Undy who were campaigning for a new railway station to serve their villages.  Brexit Party group leader Mark Reckless scorned the suggestion of setting up another commission, and educating people to avoid accidents, as adequate alternatives to the abandoned relief road. He said the 2016 Welsh Labour manifesto had promised to deliver an M4 relief road. That ""very clear promise"" had now been broken, Mr Reckless said.  Newport West AM Jayne Bryant said the decision to scrap the M4 relief road was ""deeply disappointing"". She said the city was being condemned to ""further decades of heavy congestion, idling traffic and toxic fumes"". She asked that the money set aside for the M4 relief road would still be spent tackling congestion in Newport. Mr Drakeford repeated his earlier insistence that alternative measures would be taken to ease the problem.

Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price said there would be ""many, many alleluias""  in response to the Welsh Government's U-turn on the M4 relief road. He said it would have been ""financially destructive"", in ""siphoning"" such a large proportion of public funds. However, Mr Price lamented the time and money wasted in a decision which he said should have been made years ago, and the money invested in an integrated transport system that Wales ""so desperately needs"".  You've probably read by now a lot about black routes and blue routes. The blue route was an alternative route, backed by transport expert Prof Stuart Cole, which would mean an upgrading of existing routes around Newport. When it was first proposed at the end of 2013, it was estimated it would cost Â£380m to bring the A48 Newport Southern Distributor Road and former steelworks road up to standard. Sarah DickinsBBC Wales Economics Correspondent So the numbers didnât add up for the Welsh Government.
Despite the fact its own economic appraisal report argued in 2016 that for
every Â£1 spent Â£2 would be generated by the M4 Relief Road,  it has now
decided that it is not cost effective. The argument that if you build more roads you attract more
traffic has been around for years, but increasingly the Welsh Government
has  looked at wider impacts. The Well-being of Future Generations Act forces the Welsh
Government and others to consider the impact of decisions on our health,
prosperity and equality. It has also shaken up the way the government views
the economy, beyond a simple drive towards more jobs. Now our living standards
and quality of life have to be taken into account too. The Welsh Government will have been well aware that 28% of
households in Newport have no car, and would not directly benefit from the
investment. The challenge now is for a Plan B, a viable alternative,
to ease congestion and reduce the frustrations of people living in the area. Following the first minister's statement, Welsh Conservative leader Paul Davies says people have been talking about a solution to M4 congestion for decades, which he described as a ""foot on the windpipe"" of the Welsh economy. ""We are no further forward"", Mr Davies said. ""We need less of your dithering and more action to resolve the challenges facing modern-day Wales."" Responding to the Tory leader, Mr Drakeford said the alternative measures to be followed would take effect far sooner than it would take to build a relief road. Allow Twitter content?

Mr Drakeford said even if the cabinet had not ruled the project unaffordable, he would still have rejected it on environmental grounds despite an inspector's report in favour. It would have a ""substantial adverse impact"" on the Gwent Levels wildlife habitat, and a ""permanent adverse impact"" on its historic landscape, he told the Senedd. First Minister Mark Drakeford has begun his statement to assembly members explaining his decision to scrap the M4 relief road. He spoke of ""unprecedented uncertainty"" about public funding and Brexit, and said the project would have had an ""unacceptable impact"" on the Welsh Government's other priorities in transport, health, education and housing.

"One Direction played to 10 million fans in the time the M4 relief road has been discussed The members of One Direction have been born, topped the charts and taken a career break in the time Wales has spent considering whether it should go ahead and build its biggest infrastructure project. While 1D are thought to have sold more than 50 million records worldwide, it has been 28 years since an M4 relief road was first considered and the plans are still on the drawing board. The Welsh Government's Â£1.4bn solution to congestion on Wales' busiest stretch of motorway is one of its biggest decisions since devolution in 1999. Environmentalists have called the proposal""government-sponsored ecocide"", and it has divided politicians, butdozens of businesses and council leaderswant the project to go ahead. The proposal is to build a new 14 mile (23km) six-lane stretch of motorway south of Newport to bypass a perennial bottleneck. The new road would pass through an area of the Gwent Levels environmentalists say is ""Wales' own Amazon rainforest"". 'Unique' Brynglas tunnels celebrates birthday The history of the M4 in Wales A 13-month public inquiry into the plans led to a 580-page report which has been pored over by ministers since November. The decisionis expected on Tuesday. This video can not be played This video reveals the possible route of the M4 relief road Former Prime Minister David Cameron once described theBrynglas Tunnels as ""the foot on the windpipe of the Welsh economy"". The snarl-ups at Newport's most infamous ""landmark"" are a twice-daily rush hour routine on south Wales' main road link with England. Some businesses complain traffic can regularly ""crawl at 20 mph"" and economists claim thebenefits outweigh construction costs ""two to one"". The proposed relief road would run south of Newport and the existing motorway The first suggestion that a relief road was needed followed atraffic study commissioned,externalin 1990. That was followed in 1991 by the first proposal to build a new motorway south of Newport. The existing road was built to cope with 54,000 vehicles a day, but traffic is now regularly double that, and the M4 at Newport is now theUK's busiest inner-city stretch of motorwayapart from the M25 - with forecasts predicting further growth. Brynglas tunnels 'cost Â£31m in lost time' a year 'Spend Â£1.4bn M4 cash on public transport' Police say the 300 annual accidents on the stretch between Magor and Castleton are above average compared to other motorways and a relief road is ""necessary"". Conservationists say the new M4 would be a ""direct attack on nature"" as the route would ""rupture"" through several Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSIs) on the wildlife haven of the Gwent Levels. The Welsh Government argued the new road south of Newport would take up just 2% of the SSSIs - and that millions would be spent on work to minimise the environmental impact. However, Gwent Wildlife Trust has called these mitigation proposals ""grossly inadequate"" and said that ""building a motorway to bypass a motorway is like loosening your belt to fight obesity."" The then Welsh Secretary William Hague talks to protestors after revealing his preferred M4 relief road route in July 1995 Nature expert Iolo Williams accused the governmentof potentially ""destroying"" one of the ""jewels in the crown of Wales"" and the ""green lung of Newport"". He wrote in a statement to the public inquiry the plans were ""nothing short of a joke"". The RSPB say the route would cut through thefirst nesting site for common cranes in Walesin more than 400 years. The M4 at Newport is Wales' busiest stretch of motorway with 100,000 vehicle movements daily Future Generations Commissioner Sophie Howeis against the planand has said ministers could be setting a ""dangerous precedent"" in the way they have interpreted theWellbeing of Future Generations Act,external. The politics of the M4 relief road are tricky - and it has proved divisive in the Senedd chamber. That matters because if the Welsh Government presses ahead and it needs votes, it might be difficult to get enough AMs to back it. Labour AMs are divided about it - former first minister Carwyn Jones was a big fan, but backbenchers like Jenny Rathbone not so much. Mr Jones was due to make the decision, but that responsibility has fallen to his successor, Mark Drakeford. He will not be drawn on his views on the road, but is thought to be a sceptic. He also appointed long-standing opponent Lee Waters to be deputy transport minister - although he has said he will not be involved in the decision. Beyond Labour, the Welsh Tories are believed to be split - but Welsh SecretaryAlun Cairns is keen. Plaid Cymru is a firm opponent and has called for a cheaper route. The Liberal Democrats - who have a minister in the government, Kirsty Williams - are dead against, too. The newly formed Brexit Party group of four AMs is in favour though.

The British number one, seeded 26th, played near-perfect tennis in a 6-1 6-4 win over the American seventh seed. Konta, 28, broke serve three times and dropped just 13 points on her serve. She will play unseeded Czech teenager Marketa Vondrousova in the last four on Thursday in Paris. Konta will be playing in her third Grand Slam semi-final - on a third different surface - after runs to the same stage at the 2016 Australian Open and Wimbledon in 2017. And she will look to go one better than Jo Durie - the last Briton to reach the women's semi-finals 36 years ago - by reaching Saturday's final. ""To play on the new Chatrier court against a top player and at the level I did, I'm really proud of myself,"" said Konta. ""It's hard to say if it was one of the best matches of my career, but dealing with conditions out here and against an opponent like Sloane who can run away with it, I was pleased to get her on the back foot and control the points a little bit."" 'Definitely one of my best performances', says Konta Federer sets up semi-final with Nadal Live scores, schedule and results Nineteen-year-old Vondrousova overcame her second-set nerves to close out a 7-6 (7-1) 7-5 victory over Croatian 31st seed Petra Martic. The left-hander is a fast-rising star of the game. She won her first WTA title at 17, in just her second Tour-level event. She has won more matches than any other female player since this year's Australian Open, including victories over big names such as Simona Halep and Jelena Ostapenko, and is yet to drop a set on her way to the last four. However, Konta had a three-set victory in the Rome quarter-finals last month. ""It is going to be very tough, I just can't wait to play again,"" Vondrousova said after her win. Konta's resurgence on the clay has been one which few people would have predicted at the start of the clay season, when she was ranked 47th in the world. The former world number four has shown her pedigree on grass and hard surfaces, but had never won a main-draw match on the Paris clay until this year. Signs of her improved fortunes were evident as she reached two WTA finals at the Morocco Open and Italian Open - and that form has continued at Roland Garros. Now she has won 15 matches on the surface in 2019, meaning only Martic stands alongside her in terms of clay-court victories on the tour this year. Linking up with new coach Dimitri Zavialoff at the end of last year has paid dividends, Konta once again showing increased trust in her ability to cause opponents problems with her hard-hitting game. Yet, although Konta's confidence has been evident throughout the tournament, the manner of this 71-minute victory against someone of Stephens' pedigree left those on half-full Chatrier murmuring with surprise. Stephens, who won the 2017 US Open as well as reaching the final here last year, was rated as the favourite coming into Tuesday's quarter-final, with former Grand Slam champions Martina Navratilova and Lindsay Davenport backing the American. Konta came under immediate pressure in the opening game of the match, needing to see off a break point and come through a lengthy deuce to hold serve after eight minutes. That proved pivotal as Konta swatted her lacklustre opponent aside from then on. The Briton's aggressive approach did the damage as she ended up hitting 25 winners and six aces on her way to taking 87% of first-serve points. Stephens, usually nimble around the court, had no answers to Konta's power and precision. Konta broke Stephens' serve for a 3-1 lead, claiming the next three games to win the opening set in just 33 minutes. She continued to dominate in the second set, not dropping a point on serve until she produced a double fault in the final game. By that time it mattered little, the Briton resetting to take victory when Stephens pushed a return inches wide of the line. Perhaps a sign of Konta's renewed belief was evident in her relatively understated celebration: a simple turn to her coach Zavialoff and boyfriend Jackson Wade wearing a wide grin, before raising both arms aloft as she took the acclaim of the crowd. Konta's path to the latter stages - and a potential chance to become the first Briton to win Roland Garros since Sue Barker in 1976 - has opened up following an unpredictable women's tournament. After beating Stephens, Konta will face an opponent in Vondrousova who, like the Briton, reached the Roland Garros quarter-finals for the first time. Stephens was one of only three top-10 seeded players to make the women's quarter-finals, along with Romania's defending champion Halep and Australian eighth seed Ashleigh Barty. Former world number one Halep and Barty will meet in the other semi-final - if they beat 17-year-old American Amanda Anisimova and 14th seed Madison Keys respectively in their quarter-finals on Wednesday. BBC tennis correspondent Russell Fuller:""The entire performance was breathtaking. Everything about Konta's performance was majestic. Sloane Stephens could do nothing on Konta's serve. She had the stuffing knocked out of her. That's the best I have ever seen Konta play."" Former world number five Daniela Hantuchova for BBC Radio 5 Live:""Konta couldn't ask for a better match and if she keeps playing like this I don't see anyone that can stop her. Simona Halep was my pick to win the trophy before the tournament but the way Johanna played it will be really interesting."" Radio 5 Live tennis commentator Naomi Cavaday:""I felt for sure every set would be tight and ultra-competitive but Johanna was too good for Stephens. I think Konta can take out Halep if she plays like that. That was phenomenal.""

Wawrinka 6-7 (4-7) 6-4 6-7 (5-7) 4-6 Federer Roger Federer is speaking to former French player Cedric Pioline on the court. He finishes by saying that if he came back to Roland Garros for any reason it was to play Rafael Nadal. And he has his wish. Wawrinka 6-7 (4-7) 6-4 6-7 (5-7) 4-6 Federer Roger Federer pats away a forehand volley and he has finally quelled the challenge of Stan Wawrinka. Wawrinka 6-7 (4-7) 6-4 6-7 (5-7) 4-5 *Federer The isobars are gathering in the wake of the storm. Roger Federer feels the pressure and duffs down a second double fault of the game to keep the match out of reach. For now. Wawrinka 6-7 (4-7) 6-4 6-7 (5-7) 4-5 *Federer Wawrinka with a delicious down the line forehand for advantage. Federer with a delicate drop-volley to peg him back to deuce. Touche.

"This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn said he wanted ""a dialogue"" with the president about building ""a better and more peaceful"" world Donald Trump has turned down a request from Jeremy Corbyn to meet during his state visit, calling Labour's leader ""somewhat of a negative force"". The US president said he had been approached by Mr Corbyn,who boycotted Monday's banquetheld in his honour. Explaining his refusal, Mr Trump said: ""I really don't like critics as much as I respect people who get things done."" Earlier, Mr Corbyn said Mr Trump's policies on immigration, human rights, trade and climate change were divisive. Speaking at a protest rally in Westminster, the Labour leader said he was ""very disappointed"" by Mr Trump's latest attack on London Mayor Sadiq Khan,whom the president called a ""stone cold loser"". But he told protesters he was prepared to have ""a dialogue"" with anybody about building a more peaceful, just world. Latest on Trump state visit UK will get 'phenomenal' trade deal Trump says May deserves 'credit' for Brexit efforts The Labour leadership confirmed they had sought a meeting with Mr Trump during his three-day visit to the UK and said Mr Corbyn remained ""ready to engage with the president on a range of issues, including the climate emergency, threats to peace and the refugee crisis"". Meanwhile, Mr Trump spoke by phone to former foreign secretary Boris Johnson - one of the favourites to succeed Theresa May - on Tuesday night and is due to meet rival candidate Michael Gove. He also had a private meeting with the Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage, one of the president's strongest political supporters in the UK. Mr Farage said afterwards it had been a ""good meeting"".

Asked about the snub to Mr Corbyn during a press conference with Theresa May, Mr Trump said he had ""never spoken"" to the leader of the opposition. ""He wanted to meet with me and I told him no,"" he said. ""I think that he is, from where I come from, somewhat of a negative force. I think people should look to do things correctly rather than criticise."" However, he later told Piers Morgan in an interview for Good Morning Britain that although it had been ""tough"" and ""probably inappropriate"" to meet Mr Corbyn on this occasion, he would have ""no problem"" with meeting him another time. While it is not mandatory for US presidents to meet opposition leaders and other non-government figures during state visits, it has been standard diplomatic practice. Barack Obama held talks with Ed Miliband in 2011 and also met David Cameron during his first visit to the UK as president in 2009. This video can not be played President Trump gives his opinion on three Tory leadership hopefuls In his speech, the Labour leader did not mention Mr Trump by name but did refer to ""our visitors"", and said all governments had a duty to oppose racism and misogyny. Mr Corbyn told demonstrators he wanted to have a ""conversation"" with the US president despite their multiple disagreements. ""I am absolutely not refusing to meet anybody. I want to be able to have that dialogue to bring about that better, more peaceful world that we all want to live in."" He appealed to Mr Trump to ""chase down"" all forms of racism, including Islamophobia, and take a more compassionate approach to the plight of refugees from war, religious persecution and the effects of climate change. ""Racism divides, exploitation of minorities divides, exploitation of minorities brings about hatred,"" he said. Mr Corbyn said he would oppose any post-Brexit trade deal with the US that allowed foreign companies ""in to take over the NHS"" - insisting he would defend a health service free at the point of use ""with every breath in his body"". But after holding talks with Mrs May, Mr Trump said no area could be excluded from future trade discussions, including the NHS. ""When you are dealing with trade, everything is on the table, so the NHS and anything else."" This prompted an immediate response from Health Secretary Matt Hancock, one of the leading candidates to succeed Mrs May in Downing Street, as well as other candidates. Allow Twitter content?

And Dominic Raab, who is also standing,tweeted that,externalthe NHS ""is not for sale to any country and never would be"" if he became prime minister. The BBC's political editor Laura Kuenssberg said the issue was now likely to be a factor in the leadership race. On Sunday, the US ambassador to the UK, Woody Johnson, told the BBC ""all things that are traded would be on the table"" - including healthcare. The SNP's Ian Blackford, who also addressed the anti-Trump demonstration, said Scotland must ""stand up for progressive values and against a damaging Tory-Trump trade deal"". The Welsh government said devolution must be respected and there was ""absolutely no prospect"" of the NHS being included in any post-Brexit negotiations. Mr Trump later told Good Morning Britain's Morgan that actually he did not see the NHS as being on the table. ""Somebody asked me a question today and I said everything's up for negotiation because everything is, but I don't see that being... that's something that I would not consider part of trade. That's not trade,"" he said. Analysis: By Hugh Pym, BBC Health editor There is nothing to stop American or any other foreign firms bidding for NHS contracts under current rules. The health reforms in England in 2012 required local commissioners to put large contracts out to tender.  A subsidiary of the US company United Health, along with British firms like Virgin and Circle, is among private groups which has won such contracts. Around 7% of the English health budget goes to private providers. There are different contracting arrangements in other parts of the UK. The head of NHS England, Simon Stevens, has called for new legislation to drop the requirement for health commissioners to put contracts out to tender. But if the government decides to do this it's not clear whether that might be overridden by the sort of trade deal Mr Trump would like to negotiate for the US. That's the suspicion of those who argue the NHS is vulnerable to covert privatisation. Asked about the Tory leadership hopefuls, the president said: ""I know Boris. I like him. I have liked him for a long time. I think he would do a very good job."" Referring to Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt, he continued: ""I know Jeremy, I think he would do a very good job."" On Mr Gove - to laughter from the audience - he added: ""I don't know Michael - would he do a good job Jeremy?"" Nigel Farage met Donald Trump after the president's press conference with Theresa May Mr Trump said he had only seen one ""very small protest"" on Tuesday, in contrast to what he claimed were the ""thousands of people"" on the streets welcoming him and his family. ""I heard there were protests so I said 'where are the protests?'... A lot of it is fake news, I hate to say.""

"Khuram Butt was being investigated by MI5 from 2015 The team investigating one of the 2017 London Bridge attackers was not told he had been reported to an anti-terror hotline, an inquest has heard. Khuram Butt's brother-in-law had reported his increasing radicalisation in September 2015. In the same month MI5 assessed Butt as wanting to stage a terror attack but lacking the ability to do so. Eight people were killed in the attack he carried out with two other men. They mowed down pedestrians on London Bridge before launching a knife attack in nearby Borough Market, injuring 48 others. Police shot and killed the attackers less than 10 minutes after the violence began. London Bridge attack: What happened Victims of the London Bridge attack Chances 'galore' to stop London Bridge attack A senior counter-terrorism officer - identified only as Witness M - told an inquest at the Old Bailey in London that it was ""very unsatisfactory"" his team was not informed about the call. Usman Darr had contacted the hotline because he was concerned that his brother-in-law had been distributing anti-Western texts and links to jihadi sites and had become increasingly extreme in his views. The information was processed but never passed on to the joint MI5 and police investigation of Butt that had been under way since mid-2015. In the same month that he was reported by his brother-in-law, Butt was assessed by the security service as having a ""strong risk"" of staging a terror attack on his own, but there was no evidence he was planning one. In May 2017 MI5 lowered the assessed risk of Butt carrying out a lone terror attack to moderate, but increased his ability to do so to moderate. Police decided not to charge him with possession of extremist material because there was not a strong enough chance of disrupting any potential terror plot, Witness M said. The inquest also heard Butt had associated with members of the banned terrorist group Al-Muhajiroun, including Siddhartha Dhar - who went on to fight for so-called Islamic State - andthe group's leader Anjem Choudary. The victims of the London Bridge attack clockwise from top left - Chrissy Archibald, James McMullan, Alexandre Pigeard, SÃ©bastien BÃ©langer, Ignacio EcheverrÃ­a, Xavier Thomas, Sara Zelenak, Kirsty Boden Witness M also told the inquest he had not personally been made aware that Butt had appeared in a Channel 4 programme called The Jihadi Next Door in January 2016, saying the programme was reviewed by another team. The court previously heard how Butt appeared in the programme - where he condemned the UK government, particularly over its actions in Iraq and Syria - for roughly two minutes but was not identified by name. Later that year, Butt was employed by London Underground, including working at Westminster station, but Witness M said he did not have grounds to intervene. In October 2016, Butt was arrested with three others on suspicion of falsely reporting fraudulent activity on three bank accounts, and bailed until January 2017. However, prosecutors advised there was not enough evidence to charge him. Witness M said police were also unaware of a number of pieces of information that indicated Butt was associated with the two other attackers. These included the fact they all met at Ummah Fitness Centre in Ilford, east London, that was itself run by a suspected senior member of Al-Muhajiroun, and that they went on regular trips together to take their children swimming. Last week, the lawyer representing several of the victims' familiestold the court there were ""opportunities galore"" to identify that the three men were plotting an attack. Xavier Thomas, 45, Christine Archibald, 30, Sara Zelenak, 21, Sebastien Belanger, 36, James McMullan, 32, Kirsty Boden, 28, Alexandre Pigeard, 26, and Ignacio Echeverria, 39, were all killed in the attack.

"This video can not be played What do shoppers think about Waitrose's trial? Waitrose is starting a trial aimed at reducing packaging by removing plastic from flowers and plants and offering more loose fruit and vegetables. Customers will be able to use their own containers to buy and refill produce such as pasta, rice and cereals. The supermarket chain, part of John Lewis & Partners, also says it will be the first to offer ""pick and mix"" frozen fruit. It says it wants to find out how people might shop in the future. The trial is taking place at a store in Oxford where Waitrose says hundreds of products have been taken out of their packaging and there will be about double the usual amount of fruit and vegetables package-free. In what it describes as a first in the UK, customers will be able to ""borrow a box' to take their produce home for a Â£5 deposit which is refundable when the box is returned. John Lewis bonus lowest since 1950s as profits plunge The plastic packaging paradox Waitrose unpacks groceries while you're out Tesco to trial refillable container scheme Wine and beer refills will also be offered as will Ecover detergent and washing up liquid. The trial is the latest among the major supermarkets to try to cut down on packaging. Accordingto a report by Greenpeace last year,external, Morrisons, Sainsbury's, Waitrose and Tesco allow customers to use their own reusable containers for certain products bought over the counter, such as meat and fish. Since then,at the World Economic Forum in Davos in January, Tesco and French supermarket Carrefour have said they would trial an online shopping service based on refillable rather than recyclable containers. At the time, they said a limited number of items such as toiletries, ice cream and breakfast cereals will be available to testers who sign up to the trial. Produce in Waitrose's unpacked refill stations will be up to 15% cheaper and consumers will be encouraged to use their own containers apart from for beer and wine and Ecover products. Waitrose said the frozen pick and mix fruit - such as mango, strawberries and cherries - at 50p per 100g would be cheaper per 100g than the packaged equivalent. Tor Harris, head of corporate social responsibility for Waitrose, said the chain wanted to ""help the growing number of customers who want to shop in a more sustainable way"". ""This test has huge potential to shape how people might shop with us in the future so it will be fascinating to see which concepts our customers have an appetite for,"" she said. Ariana Densham, ocean plastics campaigner for Greenpeace UK, said: ""The top 10 UK supermarkets produce 810,000 tonnes of throwaway packaging each year, so we need to see other major retailers taking plastic reduction seriously and following Waitrose's lead."" Supermarkets have been cutting down on the use of plastic bags. Last month,Morrisons started selling paper bags in all its storeswhile Co-op has been using compostable bags to replace single-use plastic bags in some stores. Waitrose no longer offers 5p single-use carrier bags although sells other bags for 10p each.

Khuram Butt's brother-in-law had reported his increasing radicalisation in September 2015. In the same month MI5 assessed Butt as wanting to stage a terror attack but lacking the ability to do so. Eight people were killed in the attack he carried out with two other men. They mowed down pedestrians on London Bridge before launching a knife attack in nearby Borough Market, injuring 48 others. Police shot and killed the attackers less than 10 minutes after the violence began. London Bridge attack: What happened Victims of the London Bridge attack Chances 'galore' to stop London Bridge attack A senior counter-terrorism officer - identified only as Witness M - told an inquest at the Old Bailey in London that it was ""very unsatisfactory"" his team was not informed about the call. Usman Darr had contacted the hotline because he was concerned that his brother-in-law had been distributing anti-Western texts and links to jihadi sites and had become increasingly extreme in his views. The information was processed but never passed on to the joint MI5 and police investigation of Butt that had been under way since mid-2015. In the same month that he was reported by his brother-in-law, Butt was assessed by the security service as having a ""strong risk"" of staging a terror attack on his own, but there was no evidence he was planning one. In May 2017 MI5 lowered the assessed risk of Butt carrying out a lone terror attack to moderate, but increased his ability to do so to moderate. Police decided not to charge him with possession of extremist material because there was not a strong enough chance of disrupting any potential terror plot, Witness M said. The inquest also heard Butt had associated with members of the banned terrorist group Al-Muhajiroun, including Siddhartha Dhar - who went on to fight for so-called Islamic State - andthe group's leader Anjem Choudary. The victims of the London Bridge attack clockwise from top left - Chrissy Archibald, James McMullan, Alexandre Pigeard, SÃ©bastien BÃ©langer, Ignacio EcheverrÃ­a, Xavier Thomas, Sara Zelenak, Kirsty Boden Witness M also told the inquest he had not personally been made aware that Butt had appeared in a Channel 4 programme called The Jihadi Next Door in January 2016, saying the programme was reviewed by another team. The court previously heard how Butt appeared in the programme - where he condemned the UK government, particularly over its actions in Iraq and Syria - for roughly two minutes but was not identified by name. Later that year, Butt was employed by London Underground, including working at Westminster station, but Witness M said he did not have grounds to intervene. In October 2016, Butt was arrested with three others on suspicion of falsely reporting fraudulent activity on three bank accounts, and bailed until January 2017. However, prosecutors advised there was not enough evidence to charge him. Witness M said police were also unaware of a number of pieces of information that indicated Butt was associated with the two other attackers. These included the fact they all met at Ummah Fitness Centre in Ilford, east London, that was itself run by a suspected senior member of Al-Muhajiroun, and that they went on regular trips together to take their children swimming. Last week, the lawyer representing several of the victims' familiestold the court there were ""opportunities galore"" to identify that the three men were plotting an attack.

"The US has said China is playing a ""blame game,"" misrepresenting trade talks between the two countries. In a statement, the Trump administration also accused China of ""backpedalling"" on trade agreements. The comments come in response to Beijing's release of a paper blaming Washington for the setback in talks. The US reignited the trade war last month by raising tariffs on billions of dollars worth of Chinese goods, prompting Beijing to retaliate. The two countries have been in an escalating conflict over trade for the past year. The scope of the battle has expanded in recent months as Washington has tightened trade restrictions on Chinese telecoms giant Huawei. Hopes for an imminent trade deal were shattered in May after the Trump administration more than doubled tariffs on $200bn (Â£157.9bn) of Chinese imports and threatened additional duties. ""Our negotiating positions have been consistent throughout these talks, and China backpedalled on important elements of what the parties had agreed to,"" astatement from the Office of the United States Trade Representative,external(USTR) said. The statement said the US was ""disappointed"" the Chinese had  chosen in recent public statements ""to pursue a blame game misrepresenting the nature and history of trade negotiations between the two countries"". US-China trade war in 300 words The next US-China battleground How damaging is the Huawei row for the US and China? Who will be hit by China's tariff hikes? This video can not be played Will a trade deal end US-China rivalry? Beijingreleased a ""White Paper"",externalon Sunday, which set out China's position in trade talks including some of its prerequisites for a deal. In the paper, China said in order to reach a deal ""the US should remove all additional tariffs imposed on Chinese exports"". While China was willing to work together with the US to reach a ""mutually beneficial and win-win agreement"", the paper said ""mutual respect"" was key. ""One side should not cross the other's 'red lines'. The right to development cannot be sacrificed, still the less can sovereignty be undermined,"" it said. Sticking points throughout US-China trade talks have included whether and how fast to roll back tariffs, as well as how to enforce any trade deal. The US has wanted to keep tariffs in place as part of the enforcement mechanism and to be the sole arbiter of whether China had broken the terms of the deal, analysts say. ""Our insistence on detailed and enforceable commitments from the Chinese in no way constitutes a threat to Chinese sovereignty,"" the USTR said. The trade war is already weighing on the global economy and China's ""White Paper"" laid out some of its impact so far. China's export volumes to the US fell by 9.7% year-on-year in the first four months of 2019 due to the US tariff measures. According to Chinese statistics, direct investment by Chinese companies into the US dropped 10% year-on-year in 2018, the paper said. No official trade talks have been scheduled since the last round ended in May. Chinese President Xi Jinping and US President Donald Trump are expected to meet at the G20 meeting of leaders in Japan later this month.

"This video can not be played What do shoppers think about Waitrose's trial? Waitrose is starting a trial aimed at reducing packaging by removing plastic from flowers and plants and offering more loose fruit and vegetables. Customers will be able to use their own containers to buy and refill produce such as pasta, rice and cereals. The supermarket chain, part of John Lewis & Partners, also says it will be the first to offer ""pick and mix"" frozen fruit. It says it wants to find out how people might shop in the future. The trial is taking place at a store in Oxford where Waitrose says hundreds of products have been taken out of their packaging and there will be about double the usual amount of fruit and vegetables package-free. In what it describes as a first in the UK, customers will be able to ""borrow a box' to take their produce home for a Â£5 deposit which is refundable when the box is returned. John Lewis bonus lowest since 1950s as profits plunge The plastic packaging paradox Waitrose unpacks groceries while you're out Tesco to trial refillable container scheme Wine and beer refills will also be offered as will Ecover detergent and washing up liquid. The trial is the latest among the major supermarkets to try to cut down on packaging.

Since then,at the World Economic Forum in Davos in January, Tesco and French supermarket Carrefour have said they would trial an online shopping service based on refillable rather than recyclable containers. At the time, they said a limited number of items such as toiletries, ice cream and breakfast cereals will be available to testers who sign up to the trial. Produce in Waitrose's unpacked refill stations will be up to 15% cheaper and consumers will be encouraged to use their own containers apart from for beer and wine and Ecover products. Waitrose said the frozen pick and mix fruit - such as mango, strawberries and cherries - at 50p per 100g would be cheaper per 100g than the packaged equivalent. Tor Harris, head of corporate social responsibility for Waitrose, said the chain wanted to ""help the growing number of customers who want to shop in a more sustainable way"". ""This test has huge potential to shape how people might shop with us in the future so it will be fascinating to see which concepts our customers have an appetite for,"" she said.

"Over the past decade, smoking has become marginalised and stigmatised. From the smoking ban in 2007 to the introduction of plain packaging a decade later, everything has been done to discourage people from taking up the habit. And there are signs sugar is heading the same way. Sugary drinks are already taxed - and now a leading think tank has even suggested sweets, snacks and sugary drinks should be wrapped in plain packaging to make them less appealing, given the excess consumption of the sweet stuff. The call has been made by the Institute for Public Policy Research (IPPR) in a new report. IPPR director Tom Kibasi believes it could make a real difference. ""Plain packaging would help us all to make better choices and reduce the hassle of pester power for busy parents,"" he said. He wants to see it adopted alongside a range of other measures, including a ban on junk food advertising. That is something that has already been looked at by ministers. But would plain packaging be a step too far? Industry has been quick to object, with trade body the Food and Drink Federation arguing that branding is a ""fundamental commercial freedom"" and ""critical to competition"". The same sort of arguments were put forward by the tobacco industry, but successive governments have still increasingly shown an appetite to get tough. Interestingly, the government has not ruled the idea of plain packaging for sugar products entirely. Instead, the Department of Health and Social Care is saying it is waiting to hear what England's chief medical officer, Prof Dame Sally Davies, has to say. Why? There is a recognition that bold moves are needed if the ambition to halve the child obesity rate by 2030 is to be achieved. Dame Sally has been asked to review the steps that are being taken to ensure no stone is left unturned. In fact, she has already suggested that another measure floated by the IPPR -extending the tax on sugary drinks to other unhealthy foods - is a real option. And she is said to be open to the idea of plain packaging, which of course would be an even more radical step. All cigarettes must be sold in plain green packaging with health warnings But what is clear from the last decade is that the unlikely can soon become likely. During the early noughties, health campaigners and academic bodies were pushing and pushing for a ban on smoking in public places to be introduced. Time after time, the government poured cold water on the move. But then things slowly began to change once Patricia Hewitt became health secretary, paving the way for even more radical measures. The approach seems to be working - smoking rates have fallen by a third in just over 10 years. Some of the credit is clearly because of the growth of vaping as an alternative. But tough public health tactics have no doubt played some part. Evidence from Australia - the first nation to introduce plain packaging for tobacco products - suggests a quarter of the subsequent reduction in smoking rates could be attributed to the move. As the debate rages about obesity, expect to hear much more about the merits of radical action on sugar.

"Fund manager Neil Woodford One of the UK's most high-profile stockpickers has suspended trading in his largest fund as rising numbers of investors ask for their money back. Neil Woodford said after ""an increased level of redemptions"", investors would not be allowed to ""redeem, purchase or transfer shares"" in the fund. Investors have withdrawn about Â£560m from the fund over the past four weeks. Kent County Council also wanted to withdraw its Â£263m investment, but was unable to do so before trading halted. In a statement, the council said: ""The announcement on Monday that trading in the investment fund was suspended was not anticipated. KCC is disappointed that, as a major investor in the fund, we did not receive this prior notification. ""We do not know whether the decision to suspend trading was linked to the council's decision to redeem."" A stockpicker - or fund manager - analyses the potential of different stocks to try to decide whether or not they will make a good investment. At its peak, the Woodford Equity Income fund managed Â£10.2bn worth of assets, such as local authority pension funds. However, it now manages Â£3.7bn, according to the financial services and research firm Morningstar. Mr Woodford's firm, Woodford Investment Management, is also the biggest investor in Kier Group, the construction and services group which on Monday warned on profits, sending its shares crashing 41%. It is understood that the fall in Kier's share price is not connected to the decision to suspend trading in the Woodford Equity Income fund. The firm said the suspension would give it ""time to reposition the element of the fund's portfolio invested in unquoted and less liquid stocks, in to more liquid investments"". The Financial Conduct Authority, the city watchdog, said: ""The FCA is aware of this situation and in contact with the firms involved to ensure that actions undertaken are in the best interests of all the fund's investors."" What went wrong for Woodford and why it matters Neil Woodford scraps bonus pay at his investment firm Neil Woodford: The man who can't stop making money Daniel Godfrey, an adviser to fund management groups,told BBC Radio 4's Today programmethat Neil Woodford was ""one of the finest fund managers that Britain's ever produced, although clearly he is having a dark and terrible moment."" He believes Mr Woodford could bounce back from this blow. ""There could be a new dawn and it's not necessarily the end,"" he said. ""It's clearly a very dark and difficult moment for Neil Woodford and his business and there may well have to be a hit to valuations to get rid of some of the unlisted holdings. But from there it'll still be probably a reasonably big fund. ""It could well be the case that in five years' time, we're looking at it and anyone who bought when it reopens will have had a great performance."" The suspension of Mr Woodford's Equity Income fund has hit shares in fund platform Hargreaves Lansdown, which included the fund in its flagship list of share recommendations, Wealth 50. Hargreaves removed the fund from its recommendation list on Monday, but investors have not responded positively. Shares in the company have slumped more than 4%, leaving it the biggest loser in the FTSE 100. Mr Woodford launched his own fund five years ago this month, with its corporate headquarters in Oxford. In its first year, it gave investors a return of 18% on their money, compared with an average rise of only 2% on the London Stock Exchange at the time. However, after the figures were released he warned: ""It's far too early to conclude that the fund's strategy has worked."" Before that, the 59-year-old had worked as part of the UK equities team at investment managers Invesco Perpetual for more than 26 years. He was appointed a CBE for his services to the economy in 2013. By Dominic O'Connell, Today programme business presenter Thanks to the banking crisis a decade ago, we know what a ""liquidity"" crisis looks like. When a bank's customers all want their money back at the same time, it fails; no modern lender holds enough reserves to cope with the outflow. Neil Woodford's problems are a fund-management version of that old-fashioned bank run. Investors in the Woodford Equity Income fund have been asking for their money back at a rapid rate - about Â£10m a week. Unlike a bank, the fund has all the money - but it is invested in a series of companies. To come up with the cash at once, the fund would be forced into a fire sale, with the result that investors would almost certainly get back less - much less - than they put in. The situation has been exacerbated by Woodford's choice of investments - many of the public companies, like Kier, Circassia and Purplebricks, have turned out to be dogs, while about 10% of the fund is in non-quoted companies, whose shares are not listed on a public stock exchange. Selling those shares can be difficult and time-consuming, so the fund has decided to stop the rot and end withdrawals. We do not know when they will resume; while the gates are up, the fund's management will be scrabbling to raise cash. The big question now is what next for Woodford? People invested with him for one reason - his reputation as a canny stockpicker who was happy to defy market convention and produced better-than-average results. If that reputation is shot - and on top of that he has stopped people from accessing their money - then the reason to choose him over his rivals has been lost.

"Over the past decade, smoking has become marginalised and stigmatised. From the smoking ban in 2007 to the introduction of plain packaging a decade later, everything has been done to discourage people from taking up the habit. And there are signs sugar is heading the same way. Sugary drinks are already taxed - and now a leading think tank has even suggested sweets, snacks and sugary drinks should be wrapped in plain packaging to make them less appealing, given the excess consumption of the sweet stuff. The call has been made by the Institute for Public Policy Research (IPPR) in a new report. IPPR director Tom Kibasi believes it could make a real difference. ""Plain packaging would help us all to make better choices and reduce the hassle of pester power for busy parents,"" he said. He wants to see it adopted alongside a range of other measures, including a ban on junk food advertising. That is something that has already been looked at by ministers. But would plain packaging be a step too far? Industry has been quick to object, with trade body the Food and Drink Federation arguing that branding is a ""fundamental commercial freedom"" and ""critical to competition"". The same sort of arguments were put forward by the tobacco industry, but successive governments have still increasingly shown an appetite to get tough. Interestingly, the government has not ruled the idea of plain packaging for sugar products entirely. Instead, the Department of Health and Social Care is saying it is waiting to hear what England's chief medical officer, Prof Dame Sally Davies, has to say. Why? There is a recognition that bold moves are needed if the ambition to halve the child obesity rate by 2030 is to be achieved. Dame Sally has been asked to review the steps that are being taken to ensure no stone is left unturned. In fact, she has already suggested that another measure floated by the IPPR -extending the tax on sugary drinks to other unhealthy foods - is a real option. And she is said to be open to the idea of plain packaging, which of course would be an even more radical step. All cigarettes must be sold in plain green packaging with health warnings But what is clear from the last decade is that the unlikely can soon become likely. During the early noughties, health campaigners and academic bodies were pushing and pushing for a ban on smoking in public places to be introduced. Time after time, the government poured cold water on the move. But then things slowly began to change once Patricia Hewitt became health secretary, paving the way for even more radical measures. The approach seems to be working - smoking rates have fallen by a third in just over 10 years. Some of the credit is clearly because of the growth of vaping as an alternative. But tough public health tactics have no doubt played some part. Evidence from Australia - the first nation to introduce plain packaging for tobacco products - suggests a quarter of the subsequent reduction in smoking rates could be attributed to the move. As the debate rages about obesity, expect to hear much more about the merits of radical action on sugar.

"Jay-Z has become the world's first hip-hop billionaire,according to US business magazine Forbes.,external It says even a ""conservative estimate"" of his earnings has him breaking the billion dollar barrier. Alongside music, his fortune includes more than $410m (Â£300m) invested in alcohol companies and a roughly $70m stake in Uber. Jay-Z, real name Shawn Carter, grew up in one of New York's roughest neighbourhoods. Jay-Z headlined Glastonbury in 2008 Widely considered one of the best rappers of all time, he once declared: ""I'm not a businessman - I'm a business, man"". And it looks like he was right. His music rights alone, Forbes says, are now collectively worth around $75m - with another $75m for his entertainment company, Roc Nation. As well as putting out music by the likes of Rihanna and J. Cole, it also works with athletes and makes films and TV shows. Then there's $100m for the streaming service Tidal - a rival to Apple Music and Spotify that he launched back in 2015. That necklace alone has got to be worth a few quid... Jay-Z and wife Beyonce have got several mansions in places like New York and Los Angeles - and, as a couple, Forbes gave them billionaire status two years ago. Historically, though, not everyone has been on board with Forbes' evaluations. Back in 2014, Dr. Dre declared himself a billionaire, but the magazine disputes this. Jay-Z has stakes in alcohol companies Armand de Brignac champagne and D'Usse cognac Last year, it estimated Dr. Dre was actually worth a meagre $770m (Â£607m) - that's despite selling his headphone brand, Beats by Dre, to Apple for more than $3.2bn.

"Sure Start centres, aimed at improving early years health and education in England, brought ""big benefits for children's health"", researchers say. The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) found a positive impact from the scheme, launched 20 years ago as a flagship of Tony Blair's Labour Party. But the think tank warns that funding has been cut and 500 sites have closed. The Local Government Association says councils have ""done all they can within ever tightening budgets"". The report examines the effect of Sure Start, an early intervention policy designed to support the wellbeing of children before they started school. The centres provide parents with information and advice about health, education, childcare and employment, particularly in disadvantaged areas. Sure Start centres are credited with lowering the rates of children needing hospital treatment Researchers describe it as a story of a ""fast rollout followed by deep spending cuts"" - but they say the centres have brought measurable improvements. The provision of Sure Start centres ""significantly reduced"" the incidence of children going to hospital up to the age of 11, says the study, which looked at the impact on health. Mum's fears on children's centres closures Sure Start being 'hollowed out', says Sutton Trust Somerset closing children's centres The study found that for every one Sure Start centre per thousand children there were 5,000 fewer hospital admissions for 11-year-olds each year. Christine Farquharson, a research economist at the IFS, said the drop in hospitalisation rates was the result of parenting advice, health education, lessons about keeping children safe and improving children's behaviour. For younger children, the reductions in hospitalisation were more likely to be for ""infection-related"" problems, says the study, while for older children it was more likely to be for accidents and injuries. These ""benefits are strongest for children living in disadvantaged areas"", says the study, while there was relatively little difference in wealthier areas. However, levels of childhood obesity were not significantly affected by Sure Start, says the study. Sure Start was a flagship policy after Tony Blair's election win in 1997 The IFS researchers, funded by the Nuffield Foundation charity, are confident the reductions in hospital admissions can be attributed to access to Sure Start centres, when other social and geographical factors are taken into account. But the think tank warns Sure Start centres have had declining support. Spending peaked in 2010 at Â£1.8bn (in current value) but was cut by two-thirds to Â£600m by 2017-18 - and about 500 centres closed between 2011 and 2017. Most of these closures were in better-off areas but 170 were in the poorest 30% of neighbourhoods, says the think tank study. There are also big differences in levels of local provision, says the study, with decisions about children's centres having been devolved to local authorities - which in turn have faced funding pressures. Researcher Ms Farquharson said there needed to be more attention paid to what worked - particularly in the run-up to the government's spending review. ""It's crucial that both central government and local authorities use the best evidence,"" she said, adding that ""limited resources are best focused on the poorest areas"". Antoinette Bramble, of the Local Government Association, said such centres were an ""incredibly important service"" for parents of young children. But she said many councils could not afford them - and more would be lost. ""It is inevitable that without new investment from government in children's services, councils will face the difficult but unavoidable decision of having to cut or close early help services such as children's centres,"" she said. Tracy Brabin, Labour's shadow early years minister, said it was ""heart breaking that such a vital service, which helps disadvantaged children the most, has had two-thirds of its funding cut"". A government spokesman said: ""Children's centres can play an important role in supporting families. ""Local councils decide how to organise and provide services for families in their areas to meet local needs - whether this is through children's centre buildings or delivering services in different ways, and we continuously reflect on what works best.""

"First Minister Mark Drakeford rejects a proposed new Â£1.4bn motorway in south Wales He has published a public inquiry inspector's report which backed the scheme to ease congestion around Newport However, Mr Drakeford revealed the cabinet decided in April the project was unaffordable 'Substantial adverse impacts' on the Gwent Levels wildlife habitat were also a factor, he added Andy Roberts, Steve Duffy and Ruth Thomas The discussion in the Senedd of the Welsh Government's decision to scrap the proposed M4 relief road has ended, so we'll draw our live coverage to a close too - thanks for joining us. There will be more reporting, reaction and analysis on the website and on all other BBC Cymru Wales news services as the day progresses. One business next to the M4 was happy that the relief road had been abandoned. Roadchef, which runs Magor services in Monmouthshire, had warned it could lead to an80% drop in westbound custombecause motorists would have faced a detour. It had given evidence to the public inquiry, warning it could even lead to drivers falling asleep at the wheel if they waited too long to take a break. Simon Turl, chairman, added: ""In light of todayâs decision, Roadchef is looking forward to working with the Welsh Government to release vital investment at Magor which has up until now been on hold"". Anita Watts, of Pant Road in Newport, has lived close to the motorway for more than 39 years. âIt has got noisier over the years since weâve been here.
Otherwise I think you learn to live with it. ""I think itâs the wrong decision in
some ways. We do need the new M4 relief because of the businesses
in Wales. ""Iâm sure they could have done a different design further down the line
that would miss the wetlands out. I think they need to go back to the drawing
board and have another look.â The Woodland Trust said four ancient woodlands would have been threatened by the building of the M4 relief road. âOne of our priorities is protecting ancient woodlands under threat and the irreplaceable biodiversity that they support, said Natalie Buttriss, the charity's director in Wales. ""We currently have around 70 cases of ancient woods under threat in Wales. ""I sincerely hope therefore that now, with the rejection of the proposed âblack routeâ..a change of direction has been initiated which rejects all unsustainable road development and reduces the over-riding threat to our precious woodland habitats.â The Woodland Trust said this ancient woodland at Coed Kernew was under threat Vaughan RoderickBBC Welsh Affairs Editor It had become clear over the past few days that the plans
for an M4 relief road were heading for the scrapyard. U-turns arenât 
normally allowed on motorways. This case is the exception, it appears. Mark Drakeford insisted that todayâs decision was the result
of a changed financial and political context. Part of that change of context
though is a change of first minister. We donât know whether Carwyn Jones would have given the plan
the go-ahead had he taken the decision himself, as heâd intended. Many suspect
that the former first minister regarded the relief road as part of his legacy.
If so, today will have been a disappointment for him. All of which, of course, leaves the people of Newport
dealing with the worst congestion problems in Wales with all the
inconvenience and pollution that go with that. That congestion isnât
confined to the M4 though.  Newportonians will be hoping that any future
measures take in not just the motorway but the A467, the A4042 and the
frequently gridlocked city centre. Rick Dempsey who lives on Pant Road in Newport near the M4. âI personally wouldnât like to see them build through the
level, it would cause too much irreparable damage...but I see this motorway at
a standstill most mornings, especially westbound, so somethingâs got to be
done. What? I donât know.â According to First Minister Mark Drakeford, these are some of the ""fast-tracked, targeted interventions"" we might now see to reduce congestion on the M4 in south Wales: Newport East AM John Griffiths said he supported the decision to scrap the M4 relief road project, unlike the Newport West AM Jayne Bryant. He said they agreed on the scale of the congestion problem but disagreed on the solution. Mr Griffiths described the Gwent Levels as a ""unique and historic environment"". The value of that habitat and a climate emergency required ""new thinking, more imagination and new ways of approaching these problems"", he added. The AM urged ministers to work with local communities, such as the people of Magor and Undy who were campaigning for a new railway station to serve their villages.  Brexit Party group leader Mark Reckless scorned the suggestion of setting up another commission, and educating people to avoid accidents, as adequate alternatives to the abandoned relief road. He said the 2016 Welsh Labour manifesto had promised to deliver an M4 relief road. That ""very clear promise"" had now been broken, Mr Reckless said.  Newport West AM Jayne Bryant said the decision to scrap the M4 relief road was ""deeply disappointing"". She said the city was being condemned to ""further decades of heavy congestion, idling traffic and toxic fumes"". She asked that the money set aside for the M4 relief road would still be spent tackling congestion in Newport. Mr Drakeford repeated his earlier insistence that alternative measures would be taken to ease the problem.

Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price said there would be ""many, many alleluias""  in response to the Welsh Government's U-turn on the M4 relief road. He said it would have been ""financially destructive"", in ""siphoning"" such a large proportion of public funds. However, Mr Price lamented the time and money wasted in a decision which he said should have been made years ago, and the money invested in an integrated transport system that Wales ""so desperately needs"".  You've probably read by now a lot about black routes and blue routes. The blue route was an alternative route, backed by transport expert Prof Stuart Cole, which would mean an upgrading of existing routes around Newport. When it was first proposed at the end of 2013, it was estimated it would cost Â£380m to bring the A48 Newport Southern Distributor Road and former steelworks road up to standard. Sarah DickinsBBC Wales Economics Correspondent So the numbers didnât add up for the Welsh Government.
Despite the fact its own economic appraisal report argued in 2016 that for
every Â£1 spent Â£2 would be generated by the M4 Relief Road,  it has now
decided that it is not cost effective. The argument that if you build more roads you attract more
traffic has been around for years, but increasingly the Welsh Government
has  looked at wider impacts. The Well-being of Future Generations Act forces the Welsh
Government and others to consider the impact of decisions on our health,
prosperity and equality. It has also shaken up the way the government views
the economy, beyond a simple drive towards more jobs. Now our living standards
and quality of life have to be taken into account too. The Welsh Government will have been well aware that 28% of
households in Newport have no car, and would not directly benefit from the
investment. The challenge now is for a Plan B, a viable alternative,
to ease congestion and reduce the frustrations of people living in the area. Following the first minister's statement, Welsh Conservative leader Paul Davies says people have been talking about a solution to M4 congestion for decades, which he described as a ""foot on the windpipe"" of the Welsh economy. ""We are no further forward"", Mr Davies said. ""We need less of your dithering and more action to resolve the challenges facing modern-day Wales."" Responding to the Tory leader, Mr Drakeford said the alternative measures to be followed would take effect far sooner than it would take to build a relief road. Allow Twitter content?

Mr Drakeford said even if the cabinet had not ruled the project unaffordable, he would still have rejected it on environmental grounds despite an inspector's report in favour. It would have a ""substantial adverse impact"" on the Gwent Levels wildlife habitat, and a ""permanent adverse impact"" on its historic landscape, he told the Senedd. First Minister Mark Drakeford has begun his statement to assembly members explaining his decision to scrap the M4 relief road. He spoke of ""unprecedented uncertainty"" about public funding and Brexit, and said the project would have had an ""unacceptable impact"" on the Welsh Government's other priorities in transport, health, education and housing.

"One Direction played to 10 million fans in the time the M4 relief road has been discussed The members of One Direction have been born, topped the charts and taken a career break in the time Wales has spent considering whether it should go ahead and build its biggest infrastructure project. While 1D are thought to have sold more than 50 million records worldwide, it has been 28 years since an M4 relief road was first considered and the plans are still on the drawing board. The Welsh Government's Â£1.4bn solution to congestion on Wales' busiest stretch of motorway is one of its biggest decisions since devolution in 1999. Environmentalists have called the proposal""government-sponsored ecocide"", and it has divided politicians, butdozens of businesses and council leaderswant the project to go ahead. The proposal is to build a new 14 mile (23km) six-lane stretch of motorway south of Newport to bypass a perennial bottleneck. The new road would pass through an area of the Gwent Levels environmentalists say is ""Wales' own Amazon rainforest"". 'Unique' Brynglas tunnels celebrates birthday The history of the M4 in Wales A 13-month public inquiry into the plans led to a 580-page report which has been pored over by ministers since November. The decisionis expected on Tuesday. This video can not be played This video reveals the possible route of the M4 relief road Former Prime Minister David Cameron once described theBrynglas Tunnels as ""the foot on the windpipe of the Welsh economy"". The snarl-ups at Newport's most infamous ""landmark"" are a twice-daily rush hour routine on south Wales' main road link with England. Some businesses complain traffic can regularly ""crawl at 20 mph"" and economists claim thebenefits outweigh construction costs ""two to one"". The proposed relief road would run south of Newport and the existing motorway The first suggestion that a relief road was needed followed atraffic study commissioned,externalin 1990. That was followed in 1991 by the first proposal to build a new motorway south of Newport. The existing road was built to cope with 54,000 vehicles a day, but traffic is now regularly double that, and the M4 at Newport is now theUK's busiest inner-city stretch of motorwayapart from the M25 - with forecasts predicting further growth. Brynglas tunnels 'cost Â£31m in lost time' a year 'Spend Â£1.4bn M4 cash on public transport' Police say the 300 annual accidents on the stretch between Magor and Castleton are above average compared to other motorways and a relief road is ""necessary"". Conservationists say the new M4 would be a ""direct attack on nature"" as the route would ""rupture"" through several Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSIs) on the wildlife haven of the Gwent Levels. The Welsh Government argued the new road south of Newport would take up just 2% of the SSSIs - and that millions would be spent on work to minimise the environmental impact. However, Gwent Wildlife Trust has called these mitigation proposals ""grossly inadequate"" and said that ""building a motorway to bypass a motorway is like loosening your belt to fight obesity."" The then Welsh Secretary William Hague talks to protestors after revealing his preferred M4 relief road route in July 1995 Nature expert Iolo Williams accused the governmentof potentially ""destroying"" one of the ""jewels in the crown of Wales"" and the ""green lung of Newport"". He wrote in a statement to the public inquiry the plans were ""nothing short of a joke"". The RSPB say the route would cut through thefirst nesting site for common cranes in Walesin more than 400 years. The M4 at Newport is Wales' busiest stretch of motorway with 100,000 vehicle movements daily Future Generations Commissioner Sophie Howeis against the planand has said ministers could be setting a ""dangerous precedent"" in the way they have interpreted theWellbeing of Future Generations Act,external. The politics of the M4 relief road are tricky - and it has proved divisive in the Senedd chamber. That matters because if the Welsh Government presses ahead and it needs votes, it might be difficult to get enough AMs to back it. Labour AMs are divided about it - former first minister Carwyn Jones was a big fan, but backbenchers like Jenny Rathbone not so much. Mr Jones was due to make the decision, but that responsibility has fallen to his successor, Mark Drakeford. He will not be drawn on his views on the road, but is thought to be a sceptic. He also appointed long-standing opponent Lee Waters to be deputy transport minister - although he has said he will not be involved in the decision. Beyond Labour, the Welsh Tories are believed to be split - but Welsh SecretaryAlun Cairns is keen. Plaid Cymru is a firm opponent and has called for a cheaper route. The Liberal Democrats - who have a minister in the government, Kirsty Williams - are dead against, too. The newly formed Brexit Party group of four AMs is in favour though.

"This video can not be played Sudan military attacks protesters Sudan's military leaders say they are scrapping all existing agreements with the main opposition coalition and will hold elections within nine months. The announcement came as the military faced mounting international condemnation for their violent attack on protesters in the capital, Khartoum, which reportedly left at least 30 dead. The US said it was a ""brutal attack"". The crackdown came after the military and protesters agreed a three-year transition period to civilian rule. Demonstrators argue that former regime of President Omar al-Bashir, who was overthrown by the military in April after months of protests, is so deeply entrenched that a transition of at least three years is needed to dismantle his political network and allow fair elections. Africa Live: Events in Sudan Sudan crisis: What you need to know How protesters keep going during Ramadan The art fuelling Sudan's revolution 'Why Sudan is shooting medics' The Transitional Military Council (TMC), which has governed since the coup, and negotiators for the pro-democracy movement had also agreed on the structure of a new administration. But the TMC's head, General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, said in a statement broadcast on state television that they had decided to ""stop negotiating with the Alliance for Freedom and Change and cancel what had been agreed on"". An election in nine months' time would take place under ""regional and international supervision"", he added. Speaking on BBC's Newsday, analyst and former British ambassador to Sudan Rosalind Marsden said the snap election would ""simply pave the way for much of the old regime to come back into power"". ""There's a real risk of violence continuing,"" she said. In the wake of killings, the leaders of the pro-democracy movement said they were cutting all contact with the TMC and called for ""total civil disobedience"" and a general strike. 19 December 2018 - Protests erupt after fuel and bread price rises announced 22 February 2019 - President Bashir dissolves the government 24 February - Protests continue as security forces respond by firing live bullets 6 April - Activists begin sit-in at military headquarters, vowing not to move until Mr Bashir steps down 11 April - Army generals announce that Mr Bashir has been toppled but sit-in continues as people demand civilian rule 20 April - Talks between the military rulers and civilian representatives begin 13 May - Shooting outside the military headquarters leaves six people dead 14 May - Military and civilians announce a deal on a three-year transition period 16 May - Talks postponed as military demands some barricades are removed 3 June - Activists announce the suspension of talks with the military, accusing them of using force to disperse their sit-in The security services moved on the main protest site early on Monday, activists said, and heavy gunfire could be heard in video footage. The demonstrators have been occupying the square in front of the military headquarters since 6 April, five days before Mr Bashir was overthrown. In a statement read on national television, the military council expressed its ""sorrow for the way events escalated"", saying the operation had targeted ""trouble makers and petty criminals"" . ""During the execution of the campaign, large numbers of these groups took shelter in the sit-in square, which led some of the square's officers, based on their judgment, to follow and chase them, which led to losses and injuries."" The military, the statement added, was dedicated to protecting civilians. Protesters set ablaze tyres to try to stop Sudan's security forces Earlier, activists said the security forces had surrounded one hospital in Khartoum and had opened fire at another. The Central Committee of Sudanese Doctors, which is close to the protesters, said 30 people - including an eight-year-old child - had been killed, and that the toll was likely to rise as not all casualties had been accounted for. Hundreds of people had been injured, it added. Some residents blame the notorious paramilitary unit known as the Rapid Support Forces, set up to help keep Mr Bashir in power and with roots in the Darfur conflict in western Sudan, which began in 2003. Then known as the ""Janjaweed"", this militia carried out frequent massacres. The Sudanese Professionals Association (SPA), which is spearheading nationwide protests, called for a campaign of ""sweeping civil disobedience to topple the treacherous and killer military council"". The UN chief urged the Sudanese authorities to facilitate an independent investigation and to hold those responsible accountable. UN Secretary General AntÃ³nio Guterres called for an independent investigation saying he was ""alarmed"" by reports that officers had opened fire in a hospital. ""He condemns the use of force to disperse the protesters at the sit-in site and he is alarmed by reports that security forces have opened fire inside medical facilities,"" a statement for Mr Guterres said. In other reaction: UK Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt said this was ""an outrageous step that will only lead to more polarisation and violence"" and that the military council ""bears full responsibility"" Tibor Nagy, US assistant secretary of state for Africa, said: ""This was a brutal and coordinated attack, led by the Rapid Support Forces militia, that mirrors some of the worst offenses of the Bashir regime"" The African Union called for an immediate and transparent investigation A closed-door meeting at the UN Security Council was due to be held on Tuesday at the request of the UK and Germany Sudan's state news agency said the public prosecutor had set up a committee to investigate the violence. Analysis by Tomi Oladipo, BBC's Africa security correspondent It is back to square one for Sudan's political process. The hardening stances that stalled the talks between the protest groups and the TMC have been further cemented on both sides. Expect more resolute protests and a possibly even more ruthless crackdown from the men in uniform. It is the latter who are governing right now. What matters is which faction of the security forces has the upper hand in the TMC. The hardliners, particularly the Rapid Support Forces - led by the deputy head of the regime, Mohamed ""Hemeti"" Hamdan Dagalo - appear to be leading the way and could display more ruthlessness than has been seen so far. There has been a total lockdown in Khartoum, indicating something has shifted within the regime. ""People power"" is taking a big hit, but protesters could be willing to take greater risks to force the military's hand, if possible. Are you in the area?

Day one of state visit in pictures Protests against Mr Trump's state visit have been held in central London. Here are pictures of events on Tuesday. In Parliament Square, protesters started the day by inflating a giant balloon depicting Mr Trump as a baby. Mr Trump travelled from Buckingham Palace to St James's Palace for a business roundtable discussion with Prime Minister Theresa May and others The breakfast meeting of British and US business leaders was intended to boost trade links between the two countries At Downing Street, the red carpet was rolled out in preparation for Mr Trump's meeting with Prime Minister Theresa May Mr and Mrs Trump arrived at Downing Street in the vehicle Cadillac One, an enhanced limousine known as the ""Beast"" The Trumps posed for photographers outside Number 10 alongside Prime Minister Theresa May and her husband, Philip May Earlier in the day, Mrs May said the UK and US had ""a great partnership"" and could shape and influence the global economy if they worked together Inside Downing Street, Mr and Mrs Trump were shown a copy of the American Declaration of Independence Ivanka Trump (centre) and Woody Johnson, US ambassador to the UK (left), also joined Mr and Mrs Trump All the frenzied activity proved too much for Larry the Downing Street cat, who settled under Mr Trump's armoured Cadillac, known as the ""Beast"" Meanwhile, a protest against the state visit started in Trafalgar Square nearby The protest included a model of Mr Trump seated on a golden toilet Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn spoke at a rally against the state visit Mr Trump said he had turned down a request from Mr Corbyn to meet during the visit. A Labour spokesman said Mr Corbyn remained ""ready to engage with the president on a range of issues, including the climate emergency, threats to peace and the refugee crisis"" President Trump and Prime Minister Theresa May gave a joint press conference at the Foreign and Commonwealth office During the press conference Theresa May recalled the moment Mr Trump suggested she sue the European Union over Brexit negotiations. Mr Trump replied: ""I would've sued and settled maybe, but you never know. She's probably a better negotiator than I am"" Mrs Trump and Mr May met the children of US embassy and Downing Street staff at an Anglo-American themed garden party at Number 10. A brass band played as the families enjoyed British and American games, from croquet to basketball, and ate popcorn and hot dogs The Prince of Wales and Duchess of Cornwall joined Mr and Mrs Trump for dinner at the US ambassador's residence in Regent's Park, London They enjoyed a European menu served alongside American wine.

"State visits are impressive, intensely choreographed and downright strange affairs. They are often notable for what goes wrong - did a visiting president break protocol by addressing one of the royals incorrectly? Did a soldier with a bearskin hat faint in the heat while on parade? God forbid anyone used the wrong golden fork at the state dinner. Whether or not in the next few days it is revealed that one of the Trump offspring took a selfie with the corgis, or the Duchess of Cambridge let Melania Trump try on her tiara in the Ladies, strip away all the excess and it's really about an expression of power. In the next couple of days, we'll see an important marking of the passage of time since decisive days in World War Two. There will be tributes to the bravery and sacrifice of the Allied forces, and restatements of the US and the UK's commitment to a relationship that is vital for both, and will endure. But the political cast, as ever, has a great bearing on how well the relationship between the UK and the US can work. Trump praises 'common values' at state banquet Five potential diplomatic flashpoints PM to challenge Trump on climate Joint appearances by Theresa May and Donald Trump have been outwardly at least, extremely awkward. That's in part because he has the habit of giving his unvarnished view of her government before he touches down, splashing controversy around in the way he so clearly enjoys. It's also been because the contrast between them is just so profound. He, the tycoon who seems to adore breaking the political rules, who vaulted his way to the Oval Office taking the US establishment by surprise. She, the careful politician who gradually inched her way upwards through the machine of the political party she loves and hoped to protect. Mr Trump, who relishes baiting those who disagree with him, and taunting the media. Mrs May, who gives the impression she would rather be left alone with her red boxes. This time that difference is all the greater because the prime minister is on her way out of the door, while the president seeks another term in office. They will have some discussions on Tuesday certainly. No 10 is expected to urge the White House to take climate change more seriously, and to think carefully about its approach to Iran. In the other direction, expect the US to raise concerns over involving the Chinese telecoms firm Huawei in developing British infrastructure, and of course, the tentative conversations there have already been about trading after Brexit are likely to continue. But don't expect dramatic joint announcements on Tuesday. If the political outcomes are a barometer of power, the truth is that Theresa May's is fading - with the US and Donald Trump having at least half an eye on who is coming next.

"This video can not be played The Queen: ""I am confident our common values and shared interests will continue to unite us"". President Donald Trump has praised the ""eternal friendship"" between the UK and US as he joined a state banquet at Buckingham Palace. The Queen said the countries were celebrating an alliance which had ensured the ""safety and prosperity of both our peoples for decades"". The president is in the UK for a three-day state visit, which includes the 75th anniversary of the D-Day landings. Earlier in the day,Mr Trump criticised the mayor of London. Hetweeted that Sadiq Khan,external- who had saidthe UK should ""not roll out the red carpet"",externalfor Mr Trump - was a ""stone cold loser"". But in his speech at the banquet, Mr Trump praised the courage of the British people during World War Two and called the Queen a ""great, great woman"". ""In that dark hour, the people of this nation showed the world what it means to be British,"" he said, adding that their bravery ensured that the destiny of the country ""remained in your own hands"". Mr Trump ended his speech with a toast to ""the eternal friendship of our people, the vitality of our nations and to the long-cherished and truly remarkable reign of Her Majesty the Queen"". The Queen praised the two countries' role in creating an assembly of international institutions that would ensure ""the horrors of conflict would never be repeated"". On Twitter before the banquet, Mr Trumppraised the welcome,externalfrom the Royal Family as ""fantastic"" and said the relationship with the UK is ""very strong"". He also saida post-Brexit trade deal could happen,externalonce the UK removed the ""shackles"", adding: ""Already starting to talk!"" Latest updates on President Trump's first day in UK In pictures: Trump's state visit to the UK Trump's UK visit: What's he bringing? Large-scale protests are planned in several UK cities during the three-day visit, including in London, where a ""national demonstration"" will start at Trafalgar Square at 11:00 on Tuesday. The Duchess of Cambridge was escorted into the banquet by US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin The banquet was held in the ballroom at Buckingham Palace The American national anthem was played and Mr Trump was invited to inspect the guard of honour Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn - who boycotted the state dinner - is due to attend and speak at the London demonstration, a party spokesman has confirmed. Earlier,Mr Corbyn tweeted,external: ""Tomorrow's protest against Donald Trump's state visit is an opportunity to stand in solidarity with those he's attacked in America, around the world and in our own country - including, just this morning, Sadiq Khan."" Mr Trump's tweet about Mr Khan accused him of doing a ""terrible job"" as mayor, adding: ""[He] has been foolishly ""nasty"" to the visiting president of the United States, by far the most important ally of the United Kingdom. He is a stone cold loser who should focus on crime in London, not me."" By James Landale, BBC diplomatic correspondent The contrast could not have been starker. The President of the United States received a warm welcome from the Queen and the Prince of Wales at Buckingham Palace. There were two 41-gun salutes - one for Mr Trump and another marking the 66th anniversary of the Queen's coronation on Sunday - as well as an honour guard of young Grenadiers resplendent in scarlet. At the same time, Mr Trump launched a verbal attack on the mayor of the city in which he is now a guest, calling Sadiq Khan ""a stone cold loser"" for questioning why the president had been granted a state visit. In truth, this is all of a piece for Mr Trump: he gets the pictures and the pageantry that he wants and will look good in his re-election campaign next year, and he gets to pick a fight with a liberal, Muslim politician that will play well with his base. Already this row is forcing those campaigning to be Britain's prime minister to define themselves against Mr Trump. Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt criticised Mr Khan for his ""great discourtesy"". But Health Secretary Matt Hancock said the office of the mayor of London should be respected in the same way one respects the office of the president. This visit has only just begun and already the Great Disruptor is tweeting angry thoughts and breaching diplomatic niceties. Business as usual, you might think - only today he also happens to be a guest of the Queen, who rarely tweets and is always diplomatic. A spokesman for Mr Khan said ""childish insults"" should be beneath the US president, adding: ""Sadiq is representing the progressive values of London and our country, warning that Donald Trump is the most egregious example of a growing far-right threat around the globe."" House of Commons Speaker John Bercow and Liberal Democrat leader Sir Vince Cable also boycotted the state banquet. Trump's visit: A barometer of political power Trump denies calling Meghan Markle 'nasty' Trump visit divides crowds at the palace The Duchess of Sussex did not attend following the birth of her son Archie, who is less than a month old. On Sunday, Mr Trumpdenied calling the duchess ""nasty"", despite him using the word on tape. But the guests included the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge as well as prominent Americans living in Britain. The Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall posed with their visitors in the morning room at Clarence House The president and first lady were given a tour of Westminster Abbey by the Dean of Westminster The US president made his mark in the distinguished visitors' book at Westminster Abbey As he stepped onto UK soil at Stansted Airport, Mr Trump was greeted by US Ambassador to the UK Woody Johnson and Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt. Tory leadership candidate Mr Hunt, who has spoken about the importance of the UK's relationship with the US, said Mr Trump mentioned to him ""some of his very strong views about the mayor of London"". Crowds were gathered outside Buckingham Palace as the president and first lady landed by helicopter shortly after midday. This video can not be played Trump shakes the Queen's hand The Queen presented Mr Trump with a first edition of Sir Winston Churchill's book The Second World War, from 1959, with gilt decorations and hand-sewn bindings in the colours of the US flag. He was also given a three-piece Duofold pen set decorated with an EIIR emblem, in a design made exclusively for the monarch. Mrs Trump received a specially commissioned silver box with a handcrafted enamel lid, decorated in royal blue with roses, thistles and shamrocks to represent the ceiling of Buckingham Palace's music room. After the private lunch, the Queen showed the couple American artefacts and other items from the Royal Collection. In a nod to the US leader's Scottish heritage, he was shown a bolt of Harris tweed. This video can not be played Mr and Mrs Trump laid a wreath at the grave of the unknown warrior as part of their UK state visit Mr and Mrs Trump met the Duke of York at Westminster Abbey, where they laid a wreath at the grave of the unknown warrior. The president signed the distinguished visitor's book in his customary black marker pen, describing the 13th Century church as a ""special place"". Their next stop was Clarence House, where they joined Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall for tea. By Hamish Mackay, BBC News A quick walk around the crowd outside Buckingham Palace revealed the presence of supporters and detractors of Mr Trump - both equally strong in their views. Phillip Butah, from Essex, wearing a MAGA hat and describing himself and his companion as ""Trump activists"", says: ""We are so happy that he's here - this visit is long overdue."" Asked what they expect the UK to get from this visit, they reply: ""Trade deals."" Corey Wright, a 25-year-old American from Ohio, in London as a tourist, sees the visit in a similar light. ""I think the visit is good for the political environment,"" he says. ""I think that needs to be worked on and that's what he's here to do."" Auriel Granville - a climate activist from Wimbledon, south-west London - came dressed as the Statue of Liberty to protest against the president's visit. ""I don't think he should be received in this way - climate change should be top of our agenda and Donald Trump is a climate change denier,"" she said. Read more about the crowds outside the palace Talks between Mr Trump and outgoing Prime Minister Theresa May will begin on Tuesday. Although Mr Trump has spoken of his admiration for Mrs May, there are expected to be differences of opinion during their talks. The prime minister willraise the issue of climate change, with a government spokesman again saying on Monday the UK was ""disappointed by the US decision to withdraw from the Paris Agreement in 2017"".

The US has blacklisted the Chinese firm for security reasons, whilethe UK may allow it to supply ""non-core"" components for its 5G network. The president's visit coincides with the commemorations for the 75th anniversary of the D-Day landings, which the Queen, Mr Trump and other heads of state will attend at Portsmouth on Wednesday. Airmen from the RAF Regiment formed a guard of honour for the couple Before the visit, President Trump toldthe Sunnewspaper he was backing Conservative Party leadership contender Boris Johnson to be the next UK prime minister. He also toldthe Sunday Timesthat Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage - an arch critic of Mrs May - should be involved in the government's negotiations to leave the EU.

"Sure Start centres, aimed at improving early years health and education in England, brought ""big benefits for children's health"", researchers say. The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) found a positive impact from the scheme, launched 20 years ago as a flagship of Tony Blair's Labour Party. But the think tank warns that funding has been cut and 500 sites have closed. The Local Government Association says councils have ""done all they can within ever tightening budgets"". The report examines the effect of Sure Start, an early intervention policy designed to support the wellbeing of children before they started school. The centres provide parents with information and advice about health, education, childcare and employment, particularly in disadvantaged areas. Sure Start centres are credited with lowering the rates of children needing hospital treatment Researchers describe it as a story of a ""fast rollout followed by deep spending cuts"" - but they say the centres have brought measurable improvements. The provision of Sure Start centres ""significantly reduced"" the incidence of children going to hospital up to the age of 11, says the study, which looked at the impact on health. Mum's fears on children's centres closures Sure Start being 'hollowed out', says Sutton Trust Somerset closing children's centres The study found that for every one Sure Start centre per thousand children there were 5,000 fewer hospital admissions for 11-year-olds each year. Christine Farquharson, a research economist at the IFS, said the drop in hospitalisation rates was the result of parenting advice, health education, lessons about keeping children safe and improving children's behaviour. For younger children, the reductions in hospitalisation were more likely to be for ""infection-related"" problems, says the study, while for older children it was more likely to be for accidents and injuries. These ""benefits are strongest for children living in disadvantaged areas"", says the study, while there was relatively little difference in wealthier areas. However, levels of childhood obesity were not significantly affected by Sure Start, says the study. Sure Start was a flagship policy after Tony Blair's election win in 1997 The IFS researchers, funded by the Nuffield Foundation charity, are confident the reductions in hospital admissions can be attributed to access to Sure Start centres, when other social and geographical factors are taken into account. But the think tank warns Sure Start centres have had declining support. Spending peaked in 2010 at Â£1.8bn (in current value) but was cut by two-thirds to Â£600m by 2017-18 - and about 500 centres closed between 2011 and 2017. Most of these closures were in better-off areas but 170 were in the poorest 30% of neighbourhoods, says the think tank study. There are also big differences in levels of local provision, says the study, with decisions about children's centres having been devolved to local authorities - which in turn have faced funding pressures. Researcher Ms Farquharson said there needed to be more attention paid to what worked - particularly in the run-up to the government's spending review. ""It's crucial that both central government and local authorities use the best evidence,"" she said, adding that ""limited resources are best focused on the poorest areas"". Antoinette Bramble, of the Local Government Association, said such centres were an ""incredibly important service"" for parents of young children. But she said many councils could not afford them - and more would be lost. ""It is inevitable that without new investment from government in children's services, councils will face the difficult but unavoidable decision of having to cut or close early help services such as children's centres,"" she said. Tracy Brabin, Labour's shadow early years minister, said it was ""heart breaking that such a vital service, which helps disadvantaged children the most, has had two-thirds of its funding cut"". A government spokesman said: ""Children's centres can play an important role in supporting families. ""Local councils decide how to organise and provide services for families in their areas to meet local needs - whether this is through children's centre buildings or delivering services in different ways, and we continuously reflect on what works best.""

"This video can not be played Tim Cook: ""We are moving privacy protection forward"" Apple has announced that iTunes is to be replaced by Apple Music, Apple Podcasts and Apple TV. There had been speculation that the tech giant was planning to shutter the music service it launched in 2001. The firm also revealed a number of new privacy measures at its annual developer conference in San Jose. A new sign-in will be an alternative to logging into apps using social media accounts, hiding the user's email address and data. iTunes will remain unchanged on Windows platforms, and downloads will still be available in a sidebar on the Apple Music app for Macs. The announcements were made at the WWDC conference, where the tech giant outlines its software plans for the months ahead. Apple's new sign in includes an email address-hiding function Apple announced several new privacy measures, building on last year's event whereit pledged to jam Facebook's tracking tools. ""Privacy is a fundamental human right,"" said Apple's software chief Craig Federighi. He said that there will be an option for apps which request location information to have to ask every time they require it, and they will be blocked from using other markers, such as identifying Wi-Fi or Bluetooth signals. Apple is also launching a sign-in-with-Apple login, as an alternative to logging in to a service using a social media account. Using this login, users can choose to hide their email address, with Apple creating a random alternative address which will forward to the real mailbox. ""The unveiling of 'Sign-in With Apple' will concern rivals, particularly the web giants,"" commented Ben Wood from CCS Insight. ""Existing sign-in services provide a simple means for single sign-in across the web. Privacy is the differentiator that will be heavily emphasised versus Facebook and Google, and represents a great marketing tool for Apple's broader privacy stance."" iOS 13 introduces Dark Mode, where apps are displayed on a black background The next iteration of the iPhone's operating system - iOS 13 - includes a range of changes to its interface, as well as new functions. The new Dark Mode enables iPhone apps to be viewed with a black background, while the Apple Maps app will come with a virtual tour experience similar to Google's Street View. Other key features include the option to silence unknown callers and block senders within the Mail app, improved search in messages, and optimised battery charging. Apple has also made improvements to its language keyboards, including the introduction of new bilingual keyboards and typing predictions for Arabic, Hindi, Thai, Cantonese, Vietnamese and the 22 official Indian languages.

"The world is facing a climate catastrophe and businesses around the world must address it urgently or face the ultimate sanction for a public company, shareholders who refuse to back them any more. That is not a message from an environmental action group but from the largest money manager in the UK, Legal & General Investment Management, which manages Â£1 trillion worth of UK pension fund investments. Its climate warning was the top of a list of concerns about the way companies are run. Other red lights included the level of executive pay, lack of diversity in senior corporate roles, the role (and cost) of political lobbying and the poor quality of the financial information provided by auditors. Legal & General insist that it is not just virtue signalling. The company voted against the re-election of nearly 4,000 directors in 2018 - an increase of 37%. That included votes against over 100 board chairs on the basis of gender diversity alone. Legal & General's director of corporate governance, Sacha Sadan, said it was getting tougher with company boards and managements. ""2018 was a record year for us as we continued to engage with companies on a broad range of issues, using our voting power to influence change on behalf of our clients. The increased figures reflect the higher standards we expect companies to adhere to"" Carillion collapsed last year Thecollapse last year of construction and services company Carillionwhich continued to pay out high salaries, shareholder dividends and get a clean bill of health from its auditors until just months before its sudden liquidation caused widespread outrage and shone a light on the standard of company stewardship in the UK. A recent report from a committee of MPs was sceptical about asset managers' appetite and ability to raise the quality of company management. The business select committee chair said last month: ""We do not have confidence in institutional investors in exercising their stewardship functions. We cannot rely on shareholders to exert pressure."" Legal & General admit they too have made mistakes. In 2012, the company voted in favour of a pay formula for the chief executive of housebuilderPersimmon that saw Jeff Fairburn awarded a pay packet of Â£100m. Mr Sadan told the BBC it had learnt its lesson. ""Since then we insist that maximum payouts are capped."" The VERY best way for investors to exert pressure is to sell their shares - or not become shareholders of misbehaving companies in the first place. Plenty of fund managers argue they are trying to ""reform from within"" while happily accepting bumper dividend pay outs from companies in some of the most controversial sectors - such as oil and tobacco. Legal & General insist they are prepared to do that and last year issued a list of companies whose shares they decided to dump. The list of eight included Russian oil company Rosneft, the China Construction Bank and Subaru. Legal & General say that all eight of those on the ""black list"" have been in touch to try and get themselves off it. Proof positive, say L&G, that their brand of shareholder engagement - or disengagement - really works. Many in the UK might find that argument more convincing if the list of no-go investments included companies closer to home that would REALLY feel the cold shoulder of the UK's biggest money manager. Shell boss Ben van Beurden's pay more than doubled last year For example, Royal Dutch Shell is the UK's biggest dividend payer by miles - offering investors a tempting 5.8% return on their money. Legal & General say they were successful in moving the chief executive's performance targets to be based on safety and environmental improvements rather than raw profit.They were less successful in tackling the sheer amount he pocketed last year - a colossal Â£17m. Roger Harrabin, environmental analyst For decades, many firms have paid lip service to climate change without substantially altering the way they do business. Then investors joined the climate campaign and began applying pressure from within. Their message is that acting on climate change isn't just a feel-good - it's a necessity to protect long-term assets. The Bank of England, for instance, recently warned that $20tn (Â£15.3tn) of assets could be wiped out by climate change. This alarming note is being amplified by fund managers who are pulling their investments out of fossil fuels. They include the World Council of Churches, the Rockefeller family and insurance giants AXA and Allianz. Collectively their portfolios are said to total about Â£7tn and they'll increasingly influence firms with discretion over their use of fossil fuels. But what about the massively-powerful fossil fuel giants whose very existence depends on mining those carbon compounds the world can't afford to burn? The slave trade was abolished only after traders were compensated for their ""loss of human property"". Will society need to compensate the oil majors for the assets they must leave underground? Asset managers are effectively the ""masters of the universe"" when it comes to telling companies how to behave as they have to vote on their investors behalf. But they have powerful customers of their own to answer to. Increasing numbers of pension fund trustees are seeking assurances that their employees' retirement contributions are not finding their way into embarrassing or inappropriate investments. The Church of England was not thrilled to find out its pension scheme was invested in the now defunct high cost credit company Wonga. More recently - and more importantly - was the decision byNorway's sovereign wealth fund to divest itself of  some of its fossil fuel investments(paradoxically perhaps - the source of all the money in the first place). But what these examples show is that the savers and citizens, on whose behalf this money is managed, are becoming more aware - and more willing to object - about how that is done.

"Andrew Tinkler denies any wrongdoing An investment fund boss has dismissed as ""unfounded"" claims he tried to ""injure"" the Stobart Group. Neil Woodford said allegations that he conspired with the firm's ex-chief executive Andrew Tinkler were untrue as his clients invested in the company. Mr Tinkler was sacked by the firm which owns Carlisle airport for alleged breach of contract in June. Stobart Group is suing him in the High Court for conspiring to harm the business. He denies the claims. Mr Tinkler, who was chief executive for 10 years, is accused of conspiring with other businessmen to harm the company's interests. Bosses at the Stobart Group, which began life when founder Eddie Stobart went into business as an agricultural contractor in Hesket Newmarket, Cumbria, during the 1960s, have sued Mr Tinkler. The hearing was told the group claims Mr Tinkler was lawfully dismissed, but he claims he was removed for no good reason, and has counter-claimed. The company owns Carlisle Airport In a written witness statement Mr Woodford, founder of Woodford Investment Management, said: ""I am shocked that Stobart has chosen to make allegations that I was a party to a 'conspiracy' to use 'unlawful means' to 'injure the company'. ""Those allegations are untrue. ""Why I would want to 'injure' Stobart, in which I have chosen to invest my investors' funds, is never explained. ""I owe duties to the funds I manage, and it is in the best interests of these funds for Stobart to be as successful as possible."" He added that, in his view, Mr Tinkler was the ""entrepreneurial brains"" behind Stobart. Stobart Group, which is worth more than Â£800m, is separate from the road transport firm Eddie Stobart Logistics. The trial continues.

"This video can not be played Theresa May: ""Unity of purpose will preserve deep-rooted ties"" with US US President Donald Trump has said the US and UK have the ""greatest alliance the world has ever known"". In a news conference with Theresa May, he promised a ""phenomenal"" trade deal after the UK leaves the European Union, but added that ""everything is on the table"" - including the NHS. Mrs May said the scope of trade talks had to be agreed by both countries. Mr Trump also said he turned down a meeting with Jeremy Corbyn, who addressed protesters in Westminster. The US president met Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage at the US ambassador's residence, Winfield House, on the second day of his three-day state visit to the UK. Mr Farage tweeted,externalthat it was a ""good meeting"" and Mr Trump ""really believes in Brexit"". Trump's UK visit: Latest updates In pictures: Day two of Trump's UK state visit All you need to know about the state visit Trump declines to meet 'negative' Corbyn Mr Trump also said in the news conference: Mrs May had done ""a very good job"" in getting the Brexit negotiations to this point and ""she's probably a better negotiator than I am"" Brexit ""will happen and it probably should happen"" because the UK is ""a great, great country and it wants its own identity"" Protests against him were ""very small"" and ""fake news"" Both the US and UK are ""determined to ensure that Iran never develops nuclear weapons and stops supporting and engaging in terrorism"" The two countries would reach an agreement to protect intelligence sharing, despite their disagreement over Huawei - the mobile internet infrastructure company which the US says is a risk to national security Conservative leadership candidate Boris Johnson would do ""a very good job"", as would Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt, but he ""did not know"" Michael Gove By James Landale, BBC diplomatic correspondent Theresa May's news conference with Donald Trump had an ""end of era"" feel to it. Only days before shestands down as the Conservatives' leader, the prime minister set out clear positions she hoped may survive her premiership. On Iran, the UK and US agree on the threat but disagree on the solution, and the US must ""do everything to avoid escalation which is in no-one's interest"". On China, she said both sides cannot ignore the threat to their interests, but they must also recognise the country's ""economic significance"" - a clear warning against a lasting US trade war with Beijing. On the transatlantic relationship, she emphasised she and the president were only ""the latest guardians of this precious and profound friendship"". In other words, she is going and so one day will he, and the relationship will endure. Read more from our diplomatic correspondent Protesters gathered in central London and other cities - including Glasgow, Edinburgh and Sheffield - to voice their opposition to President Trump's visit. Mr Corbyn - who boycotted Monday evening's state dinner - was joined at the rally by members of other political parties, including the Liberal Democrats and the Green Party. Protesters against the presidential visit launched a Trump baby blimp on Parliament Square The Labour leader had proposed talks with Mr Trump, with a spokesman saying he was ready to engage with the US president on issues such as climate change, threats to peace and the refugee crisis - but these were refused. ""I want to be able to have that dialogue to bring about the better and more peaceful world that we all want to live in,"" Mr Corbyn told the crowd of protesters. This video can not be played Anti-Trump protesters gathered in Trafalgar Square When asked about the Labour leader, the US president said he did ""not know him, never met him, never spoke to him"", adding: ""He wanted to meet today or tomorrow and I decided I would not do that."" Describing Mr Corbyn as a ""negative force"", Mr Trump said: ""I really don't like critics as much as I like and respect people who get things done."" However, he later told Piers Morgan in an interview for Good Morning Britain that he would have ""no problem"" with meeting Mr Corbyn another time. By Marie Jackson, BBC News The whistling and whooping ramps up as Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn takes to the stage in Whitehall. The rainy streets are now packed with cagoule-clad protesters holding aloft umbrellas and placards saying ""Dump Trump"". Some have their faces covered with #trumpstinks masks, others wear badges saying ""another nasty woman against Trump"". There are mums with small children in buggies who have given up a day in the park to make their young voices heard, alongside seasoned protesters and US expats. A little further up the street, police officers are dealing with a disturbance by the English Defence League. The rain's holding off for the moment but Mr Corbyn has a message for the visiting president. ""Think on, please, about a world that is aiming for peace and disarmament, that defeats racism and misogyny."" The crowd roars cheers of support. Read more. Mr Trump also suggested the NHS would be included in post-Brexit trade talks between the US and the UK. The US president said ""everything is on the table"" in future discussions between the countries, adding that a ""phenomenal"" trade deal would be reached. But Health Secretary Matt Hancock was among several Conservative leadership candidates who said they would not allow the NHS to become part of any trade talks. ""Not on my watch,""he tweeted,external. And later Mr Trump told GMB's Mr Morgan that he does not ""see it being on the table"". ""Somebody asked me a question today and I said everything's up for negotiation because everything is, but I don't see that being... that's something that I would not consider part of trade. That's not trade,"" he said. Mrs May said any trade agreement would follow talks about ""what should or should not be in that trade deal for the future"". After speaking of the US and UK's ""special relationship"", she also said the leaders had ""openly"" discussed their differences, such as on climate change, Iran and China. This video can not be played The US President promises a post-Brexit trade deal with the UK ""two or three times as big as now"" By Hugh Pym, BBC health editor There is nothing to stop American or any other foreign firms bidding for NHS contracts under current rules, as long as they have a subsidiary in the EU. The health reforms in England in 2012 required local commissioners to put large contracts out to tender. A subsidiary of the US company United Health, along with British firms like Virgin and Circle, is among private groups which has won such contracts. Around 7% of the English health budget goes to private providers. There are different contracting arrangements in other parts of the UK. The head of NHS England, Simon Stevens, has called for new legislation to drop the requirement for health commissioners to put contracts out to tender. But if the government decides to do this it's not clear whether that might be overridden by the sort of trade deal with the US mentioned today by Mr Trump. That's the suspicion of those who argue the NHS is vulnerable to covert privatisation. At the end of a day of meetings with the prime minister and a visit to the Churchill War Rooms, Mr Trump welcomed guests for a banquet at the US ambassador's residence in Regent's Park. The Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall attended on behalf of the Queen, along with the prime minister and some members of her cabinet. During his visit, the US president is expected to meet Tory leadership hopefuls Michael Gove and Jeremy Hunt. He had a phone conversation with Boris Johnson, another candidate. He also met former Cabinet ministers and Brexiteers Iain Duncan Smith and Owen Paterson.

He also visited Westminster Abbey and had tea at Clarence House with the Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall. He attended a state banquet at Buckingham Palace in the evening, during whichMr Trump praised the ""eternal friendship"" between the UK and US. The Queen said the countries were celebrating an alliance which had ensured the ""safety and prosperity of both our peoples for decades"".

"Fund manager Neil Woodford One of the UK's most high-profile stockpickers has suspended trading in his largest fund as rising numbers of investors ask for their money back. Neil Woodford said after ""an increased level of redemptions"", investors would not be allowed to ""redeem, purchase or transfer shares"" in the fund. Investors have withdrawn about Â£560m from the fund over the past four weeks. Kent County Council also wanted to withdraw its Â£263m investment, but was unable to do so before trading halted. In a statement, the council said: ""The announcement on Monday that trading in the investment fund was suspended was not anticipated. KCC is disappointed that, as a major investor in the fund, we did not receive this prior notification. ""We do not know whether the decision to suspend trading was linked to the council's decision to redeem."" A stockpicker - or fund manager - analyses the potential of different stocks to try to decide whether or not they will make a good investment. At its peak, the Woodford Equity Income fund managed Â£10.2bn worth of assets, such as local authority pension funds. However, it now manages Â£3.7bn, according to the financial services and research firm Morningstar. Mr Woodford's firm, Woodford Investment Management, is also the biggest investor in Kier Group, the construction and services group which on Monday warned on profits, sending its shares crashing 41%. It is understood that the fall in Kier's share price is not connected to the decision to suspend trading in the Woodford Equity Income fund. The firm said the suspension would give it ""time to reposition the element of the fund's portfolio invested in unquoted and less liquid stocks, in to more liquid investments"". The Financial Conduct Authority, the city watchdog, said: ""The FCA is aware of this situation and in contact with the firms involved to ensure that actions undertaken are in the best interests of all the fund's investors."" What went wrong for Woodford and why it matters Neil Woodford scraps bonus pay at his investment firm Neil Woodford: The man who can't stop making money Daniel Godfrey, an adviser to fund management groups,told BBC Radio 4's Today programmethat Neil Woodford was ""one of the finest fund managers that Britain's ever produced, although clearly he is having a dark and terrible moment."" He believes Mr Woodford could bounce back from this blow. ""There could be a new dawn and it's not necessarily the end,"" he said. ""It's clearly a very dark and difficult moment for Neil Woodford and his business and there may well have to be a hit to valuations to get rid of some of the unlisted holdings. But from there it'll still be probably a reasonably big fund. ""It could well be the case that in five years' time, we're looking at it and anyone who bought when it reopens will have had a great performance."" The suspension of Mr Woodford's Equity Income fund has hit shares in fund platform Hargreaves Lansdown, which included the fund in its flagship list of share recommendations, Wealth 50. Hargreaves removed the fund from its recommendation list on Monday, but investors have not responded positively. Shares in the company have slumped more than 4%, leaving it the biggest loser in the FTSE 100. Mr Woodford launched his own fund five years ago this month, with its corporate headquarters in Oxford. In its first year, it gave investors a return of 18% on their money, compared with an average rise of only 2% on the London Stock Exchange at the time. However, after the figures were released he warned: ""It's far too early to conclude that the fund's strategy has worked."" Before that, the 59-year-old had worked as part of the UK equities team at investment managers Invesco Perpetual for more than 26 years. He was appointed a CBE for his services to the economy in 2013. By Dominic O'Connell, Today programme business presenter Thanks to the banking crisis a decade ago, we know what a ""liquidity"" crisis looks like. When a bank's customers all want their money back at the same time, it fails; no modern lender holds enough reserves to cope with the outflow. Neil Woodford's problems are a fund-management version of that old-fashioned bank run. Investors in the Woodford Equity Income fund have been asking for their money back at a rapid rate - about Â£10m a week. Unlike a bank, the fund has all the money - but it is invested in a series of companies. To come up with the cash at once, the fund would be forced into a fire sale, with the result that investors would almost certainly get back less - much less - than they put in. The situation has been exacerbated by Woodford's choice of investments - many of the public companies, like Kier, Circassia and Purplebricks, have turned out to be dogs, while about 10% of the fund is in non-quoted companies, whose shares are not listed on a public stock exchange. Selling those shares can be difficult and time-consuming, so the fund has decided to stop the rot and end withdrawals. We do not know when they will resume; while the gates are up, the fund's management will be scrabbling to raise cash. The big question now is what next for Woodford? People invested with him for one reason - his reputation as a canny stockpicker who was happy to defy market convention and produced better-than-average results. If that reputation is shot - and on top of that he has stopped people from accessing their money - then the reason to choose him over his rivals has been lost.

"Yumi Ishikawa says she was made to wear high heels while working at a funeral parlour Around 19,000 people have signed a petition calling for Japan to end dress codes that require women to wear high heels in the workplace. The petition was started by Yumi Ishikawa who says she was made to wear high heels while working at a funeral parlour. Her tweets on the issue went viral with more than 30,000 shares. In 2015, a London receptionist was sent home from work without pay after she refused to wear high heels. The campaign is referred to in Japan as #KuToo.It plays on the Japanese words for shoes ""kutsu"" and pain ""kutsuu"",externaland also references the #MeToo movement, according to Kyodo News. Is it legal to force women to wear high heels at work? High heels-row firm changes policy Campaigners say that wearing high heels is seen as obligatory when applying for jobs. Ms Ishikawa, also an actress, said: ""I hope this campaign will change the social norm so that it won't be considered to be bad manners when women wear flat shoes like men."" She added that she had met a ministry official who was ""sympathetic"" towards the petition. It's not the first time that a campaign has been launched to change dress codes at work for women. Nicola Thorp set up a petition calling for UK dress code laws to be changed after she was asked to wear high heels at finance company PwC. She was hired as a temporary member of staff and refused to comply with the dress code. Following coverage in the media, outsourcing firm Portico announced that female colleagues could ""wear plain flat shoes"" with immediate effect. In 2017, a Canadian province scrapped the dress code which requires female employees to wear high heels. The government of British Columbia said that high heel wearers face arisk of physical injury from slipping or fallingas well as possible damage to the feet, legs and back.

"Sadiq Khan and members of the emergency services were among those who attended evensong Memorial services have been held at Southwark Cathedral to mark the second anniversary of the London Bridge terror attack. Eight people were killed and 48 seriously injured when three men drove into pedestrians before stabbing people in Borough Market on 3 June 2017. An evensong began at 17:30 BST while a special prayer service finished at 22:16 - the time the attack ended. An inquest into the eight deaths has been adjourned until Tuesday.

The Old Bailey inquest into their deaths is on its 19th day of live evidence. It has heardthe attackers stalked people like ""predators""and12-inch pink kitchen kniveswhich had been bought from a Lidl supermarket weeks earlier were used during the attack.
