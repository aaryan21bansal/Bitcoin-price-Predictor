"Passengers have been allowed to disembark the World Dream cruise ship Thousands of people stuck on a cruise ship in Hong Kong for four days have been allowed to disembark after tests for coronavirus came back negative. Some 3,600 passengers and crew on the World Dream ship were quarantined amid fears some staff could have contracted the virus on a previous voyage. Another cruise ship where dozens of cases have been confirmed remains in quarantine off Japan. The outbreak has killed 910 people, all but two in mainland China. The coronavirus has now killed more people than Sars(severe acute respiratory syndrome). In 2003, that epidemic killed 774 people in more than two dozen countries. In the Chinese province of Hubei alone, the epicentre of the coronavirus outbreak, more than 800 people have died, according to regional health officials. More than 40,000 have been infected worldwide, the vast majority in China. The World Dream was put in quarantine on Wednesday after it emerged that three passengers who had sailed on a previous voyage were later found to have contracted the virus. Chief port health officer Leng Yiu-Hong said all crew members - some 1,800 people - had tested negative for coronavirus, and that everyone would be allowed to disembark without the need to self-quarantine after leaving. WHO warns against coronavirus 'trolls' A visual guide to the outbreak Your questions answered On Sunday, Hong Kong's health minister said 468 people had been ordered to stay at home, in hotel rooms or government-run centres, one day after officials implemented a mandatory two-week quarantine period for anyone arriving from mainland China. This video can not be played ""I feel so happy,"" says passenger after leaving quarantined cruise ship In mainland China,millions of people were preparing to return to workafter an extended Lunar New Year break, imposed in an attempt to stop the spread of the virus. However, a high number of companies and businesses will remain closed and many people are expected to work from home. In Hebei province, which surrounds the capital Beijing, state media reported schools would remain shut until at least 1 March, while many parts of Hubei province remain on lockdown. Other areas are under severe travel and gathering restrictions. Several more cases were confirmed on the Diamond Princess cruise ship,external, which has been in quarantine in the Japanese city of Yokohama for nearly a week, the Kyodo news agency reports. Authorities said on Saturday 64 people had been infected on the ship, which is carrying some 3,700 passengers and crew. On Saturday, the chief of the World Health Organization (WHO), Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said the virus was still concentrated in Hubei, and that it appeared that the number of cases had stabilised slightly over the previous four days. Dr Tedros, who previously praised the Chinese government for its measures at the epicentre of the outbreak, reiterated that the slowdown was ""an opportunity"" to contain the virus. Speaking on the BBC's Andrew Marr Show, China's ambassador to the UK said it was still ""very difficult to predict when we're going to have an inflection point"", but that the ""isolation and quarantine measures have been very effective"". Liu Xiaoming called the disease ""the enemy of mankind"", but said it was ""controllable, preventable, curable"" and told people not to panic. This video can not be played The BBC's online health editor on what we know about the virus Meanwhile, concerns were growing about the whereabouts of Chinese lawyer and blogger Chen Qiushi, who had posted online videos including of conditions inside hospitals and people queuing up for masks in Wuhan, in Hubei province. Mr Chen, whose content was being widely shared, has been missing since Thursday. There are unconfirmed reports that he may have been forced into quarantine. In an interview with the BBC last week, he said he was not sure how long he would be allowed to continue to report on the outbreak, saying: ""The censorship is so strict, people's accounts are being closed down if they share my content"". His disappearance comes amid widespread anger and grief across China over the death of Li Wenliang, a doctor who tried to warn fellow medics about the virus in December but was told by police to ""stop making false comments"" and investigated for ""spreading rumours"". China has been criticised for its initial handling of the outbreak and accused of trying, in some cases, to keep news of it secret. But Ambassador Liu put the blame of Dr Li's case on local authorities, saying: ""[Dr Li] will be remembered as a hero... and for his brave contribution"". In other developments: A fourth case has been confirmed in the UK, of a person who contracted the virus in France A British man tested positive in Mallorca, the second case in Spain More than 200 British and foreign nationals evacuated from Wuhan arrived at RAF Brize Norton Last month,the WHO declared a global health emergencyover the new outbreak.

"Evacuees from coronavirus-hit city Wuhan have arrived for two weeks quarantine in Milton Keynes A fourth person has tested positive for coronavirus in the UK, England's chief medical officer has said. The new case is a known contact of a previous British patient, and caught the virus in France. It comes after around 200 British and foreign nationals evacuated from Wuhan on the UK's final rescue flight arrived at RAF Brize Norton on Sunday. There have been more than 37,000 cases of the virus globally, mostly in China, where it originated. The death toll for coronavirus has nowovertaken that of the Sars epidemic in 2003, according to health officials in China, reaching 813. In 2003, 774 people were killed by Sars. In a statement on Sunday, Professor Chris Whitty, chief medical officer for England, said the latest UK patient has been transferred to a specialist NHS centre at the Royal Free hospital in north London. ""We are now using robust infection control measures to prevent any possible further spread of the virus,"" he said. ""The NHS is extremely well prepared to manage these cases and treat them, and we are working quickly to identify any further contacts the patient has had. ""This patient followed NHS advice by self-isolating rather than going to A&E."" Meanwhile, a British man has been diagnosed with coronavirus in Majorca after contact with a carrier in France. WHO warns against coronavirus 'trolls' A visual guide to the coronavirus outbreak Coronavirus: Your travel rights explained The repatriation flight arrived at RAF Brize Norton at around 07:30 GMT on Sunday, carrying more than 200 British and foreign nationals. The Foreign Office said the flight was the second and last flight chartered by the government out of Wuhan, the city where the new coronavirus emerged. The passengers comprised 105 Britons and their family members as well as 95 Europeans. A total of 13 staff and medics were also on board the flight. Evacuees were taken on eight coaches to a Milton Keynes conference centre and hotel for 14 days of quarantine. NHS staff in blue scrubs, gloves and masks met passengers as they disembarked from the coaches at around 10:30 GMT. Passengers on the repatriation flight included UK and foreign nationals The UK's ambassador to Beijing, Dame Barbara Woodward, told the BBC that two British people who wanted to join the flight were not allowed to board after failing temperature checks in China. Elsewhere, the government in the Balearic Islands confirmed on Sunday a British man has tested positive for coronavirus. He was admitted to hospital in Palma on Friday, along with his wife and two daughters. The rest of his family have tested negative for the virus. The local health ministry said an investigation into cases that may have had contact with the man has begun. More than 100 UK nationals and family members have already been evacuated to Britain on flights chartered by the UK and other countries. They are being held in quarantine at Arrowe Park Hospital in Wirral. The latest returnees will be housed at Kents Hill Park conference centre and hotel, where they will remain in isolation for two weeks - the incubation period of the virus - to ensure they are not infected. At the hotel, they will have access to Netflix, magazines, books, baby equipment including highchairs, children's toys and games, mobile phones, and tablets for reading, games, and browsing the internet, the NHS said. Clothing and toiletries have been laid out for their arrival. Passengers on the previous flight said they were only allowed to travel with a 15kg (33lb) cabin bag. Clothing supplies are among the provisions laid out for quarantined passengers The flight follows the decision by the Foreign Office on 4 February toadvise all Britons to leave China if they can. British Airways and Virgin Atlantic have suspended all flights to and from mainland China, while other carriers continue to operate flights between the UK and China. China's National Health Commission said total cases in the country from the virus had reached 37,198 on Sunday morning. Outside of China, 288 cases have been confirmed in 24 countries, according to the World Health Organization. All the fatal cases have been in China and Hong Kong apart from one in the Philippines. In the UK, the Department of Health and Social Care said that 686 people in the UK have been tested for coronavirus as of Saturday afternoon. The virus causes severe short-term infection of the airways, and symptoms usually start with a fever, followed by a dry cough. Most people are likely to fully recover - just as they would from the flu. Two of the UK coronavirus cases - both Chinese nationals - are being treated at the Royal Victoria Infirmary in Newcastle. After the third case was confirmed, it emerged that the British man had been exposed to the virus in Singapore and stopped at a ski resort in France before returning home. There, five more Britons - four adults and a nine-year-old boy - staying at the same chalet in the Alpstested positive for the virus. A student at Portslade Aldridge Community Academy in Brighton is self-isolating for 14 days following advice from Public Health England. Were you evacuated?

"A cartoon cat, sick of the annoying mouse living in his home, devises a plot to take him out with a trap loaded with cheese. The mouse, wise to his plan, safely removes the snack and saunters away with a full belly. You can probably guess what happens next. The story ends as it almost always does: with the cat yelling out in pain as yet another plan backfires. The plot may be familiar, but the story behind it may not be. From Academy Award wins to secret production behind the Cold War's Iron Curtain - this is how Tom and Jerry, who turn 80 this week, became one of the world's best known double-acts. The duo was dreamt up from a place of desperation. MGM's animation department, where creators Bill Hanna and Joe Barbera worked, had struggled to emulate the success of other studios who had hit characters like Porky Pig and Mickey Mouse. Out of boredom, the animators, both aged under 30, began thinking up their own ideas. Barbera said he loved the simple concept of a cat and mouse cartoon, with conflict and chase, even though it had been done countless times before. Puss gets the Boot was the first they released, in 1940. The debut was a hit and won the studio an Oscar nomination for best animated short. Despite their work, the animators were not credited. Managers initially told them not to put all their eggs in one basket. A change of heart came only when a letter arrived from an influential industry figure in Texas asking when she would see another one of those ""wonderful cat and mouse cartoons"". Jasper and Jinx, as they were first known, became Tom and Jerry. Sometimes friends, sometimes foes - their slapstick violence appealed to adults in cinema audiences too According to Barbera there was no real discussion about the characters not speaking, but having grown up with silent films starring Charlie Chaplin, the creators knew they could be funny without dialogue. Music composed by Scott Bradley underscored the action and Tom's trademark human-like scream was voiced by Hanna himself. For the best part of the next two decades, Hanna and Barbera oversaw the production of more than 100 of these shorts. Each took weeks to make and cost up to $50,000 to produce, so only a handful could be made every year. These Tom and Jerrys are almost universally considered the best, with rich hand-drawn animation and detailed backdrops helping win them seven Academy Awards and cameos in Hollywood feature films. The cow shed where classic cartoons were made How a DreamWorks movie sparked a regional row Spirited Away dominates Chinese box office ""I'll bet when you watched them as a child, or even if you look at them right now, you would be hard-pressed to know when they were made,"" says Jerry Beck, a cartoon historian who has worked in roles across the industry. ""There's something about animation. It's evergreen, it doesn't fade,"" he says. ""A drawing is a drawing, it's like when you go see paintings. Yes, we know they're from the 1800s or 1700s - it doesn't matter and it still speaks to you today."" ""That's the thing with these cartoons. What we've learned in time is that they really are great art. They're not disposable throwaway entertainment."" Jerry danced with Gene Kelly in a musical sequence in 1945's Anchors Aweigh The pair also appeared alongside swimmer and actress Esther Williams in 1953's Dangerous When Wet When producer Fred Quimby retired in the mid-1950s, Hanna and Barbera took over MGM's cartoon department just as budget cuts closed in. Studio bosses, threatened by the growing popularity of television, realised they could make almost as much money by re-issuing the old shorts as they could by making new ones. When their department was closed down in 1957, Hanna and Barbera set up their own production company. But only a few years later, MGM decided to revive Tom and Jerry without its original creators. In 1961 they outsourced to a studio in Prague to save on costs. Chicago-born animator Gene Deitch was tasked with heading the remake, but struggled with a tight budget and staff with no knowledge of the original. His studio also secretly made episodes of other cartoons, including Popeye. Czech names were Americanised on the credits to stop viewers associating the shows with Communism. Allow YouTube content?

""Because of the Iron Curtain, the animators in the studio here in Prague had never ever even seen a Tom and Jerry cartoon,""Deitch later told Radio.cz,external. He knew, being the first to follow up the classics, that he would be ""in the line of fire"" from fans, and his 13 cartoons are regularly labelled the worst. In interviews Deitch was honest about their bad reputation and revealed he even received a death threat over them. After him the task fell to Chuck Jones, best known for his work on Looney Tunes at Warner Brothers. Under him, Tom's eyebrows grew thicker and his face more twisted, and was more like the Dr Seuss character the Grinch that Jones also animated. Chuck Jones was behind 34 shorts made in Hollywood from 1963 to 1967 Mark Kausler, 72, is one of many people who have warm memories of Tom and Jerry growing up. He dragged his father to see reels of the shorts, over and over, at his local cinema in St Louis. He began making his own cartoons, partly inspired by the characters, and went onto an extensive animation career of his own. ""So much of it is based on the way they look and the timing and the way the music works and everything,"" he says. ""It was such a wonderful formula, the way everything interconnected."" ""And when they tried to disassemble and reassemble it with another crew and with another type of designer and other comedy - it just rings inauthentic to me, if you know what I mean."" Kausler worked on dozens of productions, including Who Framed Roger Rabbit and Felix the Cat He came a little too late into the industry to work on Tom and Jerry itself, but remembers the excitement of the ""monumental"" moment Hanna and Barbera showed up to his animation school. At MGM, television had been seen as a ""bad word"", but after going it alone Hanna and Barbera pivoted into the platform. With longer episodes and smaller budgets, they adapted their animation style and used tricks to save time and money. Their cartoons dominated children's television for decades. They first found success in the early 1960s with characters like Huckleberry Hound and Yogi Bear and soon, more hits like The Flintstones, Top Cat and Scooby Doo followed. In the 1970s the pair returned to Tom and Jerry. By then, many of the early episodes were considered ""too violent"" under fresh guidelines issued to networks. New episodes, with the duo as friends, never lived up to the success of the originals. Hanna (left) and Barbera (right) tried to hire back as many of their MGM staff as they could The Jetsons were among a string of television hits created by their pair in the 1960s Like other cartoons of the time, the show's legacy has also been complicated by long-standing criticism of its depictions of race. In particular, the character of ""Mammy Two Shoes"" - a black housemaid with an exaggerated southern accent usually seen from the waist down - has been labelled an offensive racial caricature. Parts of the series also contain jokes using blackface and derogatory depictions of Asians and native Americans. When the originals were broadcast on US television in the 1960s, some scenes were edited out with ""Mammy"" replaced with new characters added by Jones's team. Today the worst-offending episodes are usually cut from re-release collections and streaming platforms. Attention was drawn to this in 2014 whenAmazon Prime Instant Video added a ""racial prejudice"" warning to the series. Tom and Jerry, with its slapstick violence and dark comedy, remains extremely popular around the world today. It can be found on children's television everywhere from Japan to Pakistan and a new mobile phone game has more than 100m users in China. The show has also, surprisingly, found itself in news headlines. In 2016, a top Egyptian official tried to blame the cartoon for rising violence in the Middle East and Iran's Supreme Leader has compared their US relations to Tom and Jerry at least twice. Tom and Jerry is still very popular in India, where it is broadcast in several languages A painting of Tom and Jerry seen in Iraq's Domiz refugee camp in 2014 As a regular on the BBC schedule for decades, it became particularly well liked in the UK anda 2015 poll named Tom and Jerry as the most popular cartoon in Britain,externalamong adults. In the 80 years since their creation, the cat and mouse have appeared in everything from a ""kids"" version to a 1992 musical movie where they sang and spoke. Bill Hanna died in 2001,externaland Joe Barbera passed away in 2006. A year before his death, Barbera was credited for the last time on a Tom and Jerry short - which was also his first without his former partner. ""We understood each other perfectly, and each of us had deep respect for the other's work,"" he said of their working relationship. Tom and Jerry: The Movie had a disappointing box office run in 1992 A new version of the show, animated by flash instead of being hand-drawn, has been broadcast since 2014. Warner Brothers, who now own the rights to Tom and Jerry, will release a new live-action film just before Christmas this year. Not much is known about the project, except that actors including ChloÃ« Grace Moretz and Ken Jeong have signed on. For Jerry Beck, Tom and Jerry's enduring appeal comes in part from the character's universal relatability. ""I think most people can identify with little Jerry because there's always an oppressor in our lives,"" he says. ""We always have someone, our boss, our landlord, politics - whatever it is. And we're just trying to live our lives and somebody wants to disturb it.""

"This video can not be played What is Solar Orbiter and what's it going to do? Europe's audacious Solar Orbiter probe has lifted off on its quest to study the Sun from close quarters. The â¬1.5bn (Â£1.3bn) mission is packed with cameras and sensors that should reveal remarkable new insights on the workings of our star. Scientists want to better understand what drives its dynamic behaviour. The spacecraft launched aboard an Atlas rocket, which lifted off from Cape Canaveral in Florida at 04:03 GMT (23:03 local time Sunday). The Sun will occasionally eject billions of tonnes of matter and entangled magnetic fields that can disrupt activity at Earth. The worst of these storms will trip the electronics on satellites, interfere with radio communications and even knock over power grids. Researchers hope the knowledge gained from Solar Orbiter (SolO) will improve the models used to forecast the worst of the outbursts. Sun's surface seen in remarkable new detail Solar Orbiter ready to take on audacious mission Joint mission blasts skyward to Mercury This video can not be played The Sun's surface as viewed by the Daniel K Inouye Solar Telescope on Hawaii The probe is a flagship venture of the European Space Agency (Esa), but with the participation of its US counterpart, Nasa. And it's the Americans who've taken on the responsibility for launching SolO. SolO will be put on a path that takes it periodically to within 43 million km (27 million miles) of the Sun's surface. That's closer in than the planet Mercury where the temperatures are searing. To survive, the probe will have to work from behind a large titanium shield. BBC Radio 4's In our time: What is the solar wind and how does it affect us? Pictures will be snapped through peepholes that must be closed after a data-gathering session to prevent internal components from melting. ""We've had to develop lots of new technologies in order to make sure that the spacecraft can survive temperatures of up to 600C,"" said Dr Michelle Sprake, a systems engineer with European aerospace manufacturer Airbus. ""One of the coatings that makes sure the spacecraft doesn't get too hot is actually made out of baked animal bones,"" she told BBC News. Solar Orbiter rode to space on a United Launch Alliance Atlas rocket SolO has six imagers and four in-situ instruments. The latter will sample the excited gas (plasma) and magnetic fields as they race away from our star and flow over the spacecraft. ""Solar Orbiter is all about the connection between what happens on the Sun and what happens in space,"" explained Prof Tim Horbury from Imperial College London. ""We need to go close to the Sun to look at a source region, then measure the particles and fields that come out from it. It's this combination, plus the unique orbit, that makes Solar Orbiter so powerful in studying how the Sun works and affects the Solar System."" This video can not be played Prof Lucie Green: ""You get explosions and eruptions in the atmosphere of our star"" That unique orbit will lift SolO out of the plane of the planets to look down on the Sun's poles. ""We don't yet have a detailed understanding of why the Sun has an 11-year cycle over which activity rises and falls,"" said Prof Lucie Green from University College London. ""There are missing observations that prevent us from knowing which of our theories are correct, and those missing observations are the ones we've never made of the poles."" What the researchers will see, they cannot say for sure. But the expectation is that SolO will detect signals of when the Sun's activity is about to change. ""We believe we will see indications of the next cycle early on in the polar regions,"" speculated Esa project scientist Dr Daniel MÃ¼ller. ""These are small concentrations of magnetic field."" SolO took eight years to build and test This decade is expected to be a golden one for advances in solar physics. SolO's launch follows hot on the heels ofthe Americans' Parker probe, which shares many of the same scientific goals and even some of the same kinds of instruments. And here on Earth, an astounding new 4m telescope has just opened on Hawaii. Called the Daniel K Inouye Solar Telescope (DKIST), this facility can resolve details on the Sun's surface that are a mere 30km across. Its ""first light"" images released last monthshowed boiling cells of plasma in spectacular detail. ""SolO sits in this family of missions studying the inner Solar System. I regard it as a kind of orchestra. Every instrument plays a different tune but together they play the symphony of the Sun,"" said Prof GÃ¼nther Hasinger, Esa's director of science.

"Ballot boxes are opened at the RDS in Dublin at the start of the Irish general election count on Sunday Sinn FÃ©in president Mary Lou McDonald has described the Irish general election as ""something of a revolution in the ballot box"". Counting is continuing and the first results have come in, with Sinn FÃ©in winning the most first preference votes. With all first preferences counted, it has 24.5% compared to 22.2% for Fianna FÃ¡il and 20.9% for Fine Gael. No one party will win enough seats for an outright majority. Before the election, both Fine Gael and Fianna FÃ¡il ruled out forming a government with Sinn FÃ©in, citing its tax policies and IRA past as deterrents. On Sunday evening taoiseach (Irish PM) and Fine Gael leader Leo Varadkar said it would be ""challenging"" to form a government. Fianna FÃ¡il leader MicheÃ¡l Martin did not rule out working with Sinn FÃ©in, but said ""significant incompatibilities"" still existed. Follow live updates Profile of Ireland's political parties Polling in the election closed at 22:00 local time on Saturday. Ballot boxes from across the 39 constituencies were opened at 09:00 on Sunday. Many counts have finished for the night and will resume at 10:00 on Monday, but some are continuing. Sinn FÃ©in ran 42 candidates across the 39 multi-seat constituencies, about half that of both Fine Gael and Fianna FÃ¡il, which will have a knock-on effect on the number of seats it can secure in the 160-seat DÃ¡il (Irish parliament) where 80 seats are needed for a majority. From left: MicheÃ¡l Martin (Fianna FÃ¡il), Leo Varadkar (Fine Gael) and Mary Lou McDonald (Sinn FÃ©in) Once the final number of seats for each party is known, leaders will try to form a coalition government in order to avoid another general election. Before the election both Fine Gael and Fianna FÃ¡il said they would not enter coalition with Sinn FÃ©in. Arriving at the RDS count centre in Dublin on Sunday afternoon, Sinn FÃ©in leader Mary Lou McDonald said she was exploring options to see if it would be possible to form a government without either Fine Gael or Fianna FÃ¡il. Fine Gael leader Leo Varadkar said his party has consistently ruled out forming a coalition with Sinn FÃ©in ""in large part because of their policies in relation to crime, tax and the way the economy and society should be run and also our deep concerns about their democratic structures. ""We don't believe a coalition between Sinn FÃ©in and Fine Gael is a viable option,"" he said. He said a ""forced marriage would not result in a good government."" Fianna FÃ¡il leader MicheÃ¡l Martin did not rule out working with Sinn FÃ©in, but said ""significant incompatibilities"" still existed. He said reports suggested that his party ""would be the largest"". He added that he was a ""democrat"" and respected the vote of the people. Sinn FÃ©in's Donnchadh Ã Laoghaire celebrates being the first TD elected Followingthe last election in 2016 Sinn FÃ©in had 23 seatsin the DÃ¡il (Irish parliament). There are 160 seats up for election this time around, and Sinn FÃ©in is set to dramatically increase how many it holds after it won the most first preference votes. Ms McDonald said this election was about ""change"". She topped the poll in her four-seat Dublin Central constituency. ""The frustration people have felt for a long time with the two-party system, whereby Fine Gael and Fianna FÃ¡il handed the baton of power between each other - that's now over,"" she said. ""We now have a very substantial mandate."" She said she was exploring options to see to see if it was possible to form a government without Fine Gael and Fianna FÃ¡il. This video can not be played 'Excluding Sinn FÃ©in would be wrong' By Chris Page, BBC News Ireland Correspondent Sunday evening is seeing a cascade of results from across the country. Many early victories have gone to Sinn FÃ©in - with no part of the country looking untouched by the party's surge. While the general picture is becoming clear - the final numbers will be determined by the process of numerical preferences trickling down through the various stages of the counts. Sinn FÃ©in surpluses will be very much in play here - as the party was only running one candidate in many constituencies, the destination of the transfers from the successful runners is set to have an impact on what other parties take the seats. The latest seat projection by University College Dublin, for RTÃ, puts Fianna Fail as the largest party on 45 seats - with Sinn FÃ©in on 37 and Fine Gael on 36. Plenty of counting is still to come. Fine Gael has been in government since 2011, firstly with the Labour Party and then with independents and with a confidence and supply deal with Fianna FÃ¡il. It looks set to lose seats for the second election in a row, but that does not necessarily rule it out of forming another government. Its share of first precence votes dropped from 25.5% at the last election to 20.9%. Party leader Leo Varadkar reiterated that he did not want to enter into government with Sinn FÃ©in and said Ms McDonald had not been in contact with him. The taoiseach said he was ""not really"" disappointed that he did not top the poll in his own constituency. He did get an increase in his votes compared to the last election. He added it was now clear there was now a ""three-party system"". This video can not be played Leo Varadkar: 'My position on Sinn FÃ©in hasn't changed' Fianna FÃ¡il has been in government for more years than anyone else since Ireland became independent, but it has not been the ruling party since 2011. Earlier on Sunday MicheÃ¡l Martin said reports suggested his party ""would be the largest"" but that it was early days. He said there was a lot of ""volatility"", adding people who could not get elected in the local elections had been successful in this one. He said the most important thing when forming a government was ""compatibility in the programme for government"" and that formation of a government was going to be very difficult. Mr Martin added he was a ""democrat"" and respected the will of the people. Despite previously saying he would not govern with Sinn FÃ©in he has now not ruled that out. Fianna FÃ¡il leader MichÃ©al Martin and family at the St Anthony's boys' school polling station in Ballinlough, County Cork The Green Party is also set to increase the number of seats it holds. Green leader Eamon Ryan, who was elected on the first count for Dublin Bay South, said his party would play its part in talks to form a government. Ruth Coppinger from the left wing alliance Solidarity-People Before Profit lost her seat. Labour Party leader Brendan Howlin said it had not been a good day for his party as it had been squeezed by Sinn FÃ©in. The party's former leader Joan Burton lost her seat in Dublin West. She was first elected to the DÃ¡il in 1992. The Social Democrats co-leader Catherine Murphy said it was ""historic,"" saying there had been a ""seismic shift"". She said she knew there was a wind in the Sinn FÃ©in sail. Eamon Ryan was in an upbeat mood about his party's prospects The Green Party secured 7.1% of first preference votes, followed by Labour (4.4%), Social Democrats (2.9%), Solidarity-People Before Profit (2.6%). AontÃº (1.9%) independents (12.2%) and others (1.3%) accounted for the rest. Anexit poll,external- commissioned jointly by Irish national broadcasters RTÃ and TG4, as well as The Irish Times and University College Dublin suggested a move toward Sinn FÃ©in among younger voters, with the party receiving the largest number of first preference votes among 18-24 years olds (31.8%). The majority of voters over the age of 65 appear to have given their first preference to Fine Gael or Fianna FÃ¡il. Voting papers are organised at the counting centre at the RDS in Dublin on Sunday Ireland's elections are carried out under the proportional representation (PR) voting system, using the single transferable vote (STV). Voters wrote ""1"" opposite their first choice candidate, ""2"" opposite their second choice, ""3"" opposite their third choice and so on. This means that the picture presented when the first preference votes are counted does not completely reflect the final outcome. Newly elected TDs will gather on 20 February . The ceann comhairle, or speaker, is automatically re-elected. In most situations, the speaker does not vote, so a government will need 80 TDs to hold a majority.

"Joe Biden (L) and Pete Buttigieg have clashed in their run for the presidential nomination The battle between US Democratic presidential hopefuls Pete Buttigieg and Joe Biden has heated up this weekend following the chaos of last week's Iowa caucus. Appearing on ABC's This Week, the two candidates continued to attack each other's record. Their interviews came after Mr Biden shared a video mocking Pete Buttigieg's record as mayor of South Bend, Indiana. The first primary of the election begins in New Hampshire on Tuesday. Why a young former mayor is surging in US election Biden vows to press on despite Iowa 'gut punch' A simple guide to US primaries and caucuses Final results from last Monday's Iowa caucus, which was beset by technical problems, give Mr Buttigieg victory over Bernie Sanders, with Mr Biden trailing in fourth place.

This video can not be played Buttigieg chokes up as he takes early lead in Iowa result Mr Biden's new campaign video,external, which has been viewed four million times since it was posted on Twitter on Saturday, launched a scathing attack on Mr Buttigieg, comparing his own achievements as vice-president to his opponent's record as mayor of the city of South Bend. The video claimed that Mr Buttigieg had fired a black police chief and forced out a black fire chief during his time as mayor. ""The vice president's decision to run this ad speaks more to where he currently stands in this race than it does about Pete's perspective as a mayor and veteran,"" Mr Buttigieg's national press secretary responded. Asked in an interview with ABC News on Sunday if he thought Mr Buttigieg had ""a race problem"", Mr Biden replied: ""No, I'm saying he hasn't been able to unify the black community, that's what I'm saying.""

""We need to have a systemic vision for dismantling systemic racism,"" he went on to say. Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren also on Sunday attacked Mr Buttigieg - a former McKinsey management consultant - for his support from wealthy donors. Asked about Mr Buttigieg's supporters, she told ABC: ""The coalition of billionaires is not exactly what's going carry us over the top."" Speaking on Saturday at a dinner in Manchester - the state's largest city - Ms Warren said she is ""not running a race that has been shaped by a bunch of consultants. ""I'm not offering a bunch of proposals that have been carefully designed not to offend big donors."" Senator Bernie Sanders criticised Mr Buttigieg on Sunday, telling an audience in Plymouth that he was taking money from ""40 billionaires"". In response, Mr Buttigieg told CNN that Mr Sanders, who is also a former small town mayor, is ""pretty rich. And I would happily accept a contribution from him"".

"The proposal to make discrimination on the grounds of sexual identity or orientation illegal has proved controversial Voters in Switzerland have backed a proposal to make discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and sexual identity illegal. The result - 63.1% in favour to 36.9% against - is a huge boost for Switzerland's LGBT community. It had argued Swiss law on the issue lagged far behind other countries in Europe. Opponents of the new law argued it could restrict free speech. In Switzerland, discrimination because of race or religion is already illegal. In the run up to the vote, campaigners had said they thought the result would be tight, and that a yes vote of more than 60% was unlikely. Sunday's outcome shows public opinion is far more receptive to strengthening anti-discrimination legislation than analysts had predicted. Why are some places gay-friendly and not others? 'I quit my family and I'm happier for it' Pink Cross Switzerland said: ""The result proves a strong sign of acceptance for lesbians, gays and bisexuals. After the clear yes, the LGBTI community will use this momentum to achieve the consistent implementation of the penal code and to enforce marriage equality."" A bill to legalise same-sex marriage is currently on its way through parliament. ""Many Swiss people tend to overrate how modern our country is,"" explains Anna Rosenwasser of the Swiss Lesbian Organisation. She points out that onthe Rainbow Map of 49 countries' respect for LGBT rights,external, Switzerland ranks just 23rd. ""It might be rich, but it's really not modern yet. We have no laws concerning public discrimination based on sexual orientation."" To support her argument that the lack of legal protection causes harm to the gay community, Ms Rosenwasser cites suicide rates: ""Amongst queer people in Switzerland, it is five times higher compared to heterosexual people. That's quite something, it shows how we are not feeling safe yet."" Anna Rosenwasser (L) says Switzerland needs to modernise ""We don't even know if jokes about gays will be allowed,"" Benjamin Fischer of the right-wing Swiss People's Party told Swiss television. ""Some say yes, some say no they will be punishable. We live in a country with freedom of expression, people should be allowed to think and say what they like, even if it's a bit stupid or tasteless."" There was opposition too from some religious groups. Although Switzerland's reformed church backed the new law, the Swiss Evangelical Alliance, which has significant support in rural areas, was sceptical. Gay bishop will not push for same-sex marriage Why Chinaâs LGBT hide their identities at Lunar New Year ""Our churches see the marriage of a man and a woman as the only couple they want to marry,"" explains the general secretary of the alliance, Marc Jost. ""We just want to be free to say: 'Ok, we want to privilege the marriage of a man and a woman.' And we don't want to be at risk if we share this opinion, and treat other couples in a different way."" Marc Jost is not comfortable with the moves to legalise same-sex marriage, despite family circumstances that might have encouraged him towards a different point of view. Marc Jost (L) does not agree with same-sex marriage even though his father Samuel (R) is gay ""My father is gay and lives in a civil union, and of course we disagree on very personal questions,"" he explains. ""But we still have a good relationship. It's important to show it's possible to peacefully disagree on important questions in life."" Supporters of the law argued that no-one would be prosecuted for private comments, or for religious beliefs. But, they say, the law should protect the LGBT community from public discrimination, and aggression. Members of the gay communityinterviewed by Switzerland's 20 Minuten paper,externalsaid they were often physically attacked, some even hospitalised. Other groups of young men told the same paper they felt it was ok to hit openly gay couples, even suggesting they could be ""cured with a few punches"". This is the point, says campaigner Jessica Zuber, where the argument over freedom of expression goes too far.

The film about gay love shaking up Georgia The region which legislates who you can love That would be an important sign for Anna Rosenwasser, who knows what it is like to feel uneasy about expressing her identity. ""I actually dated men for 10 years. Now I have a girlfriend, and we are a cuddly couple, we do hold hands. But there are situations where we will not hold hands, in order to feel more safe.

"Morgan Dunn was found seriously hurt in a house in Marigold Square but died at the scene Police have launched a murder inquiry after a man died following reports of a fight at a house in South Ayrshire. Morgan Dunn, who was 34, was found seriously injured at a property in Marigold Square in Ayr at about 16:00 on Saturday. Despite efforts by the emergency services to save him, he died at the scene.

A post-mortem examination is due to take place to establish how Mr Dunn, from Hawkhill Drive in Stevenston, died. Det Ch Insp Stevie Wallace said: ""From our inquiries so far, we understand that there was an altercation between Mr Dunn and another person in the house in Marigold Square which resulted in him being fatally injured.

"Concerns have been raised over ""deposit-free"" renting being mis-sold to tenants who do not understand the costs involved. The option allows renters to pay a smaller, generally non-refundable fee in place of a traditional deposit. Companies and letting agents offering it say it reduces upfront costs. But campaign groups and the ombudsman have warned some are pushing deposit-free options without making it clear they could cost renters more over time. A traditional deposit is typically up to five weeks' rent - but this is refunded at the end of the tenancy, minus any deductions for damage or unpaid rent. With deposit-free options, renters pay less initially - usually a one-off payment equivalent to one week's rent or a monthly fee. But this is generally non-refundable and cannot be used to pay for damages. 'I was charged illegal fees by my letting agent' Where does rent hit young people the hardest? When Simon first heard about the possibility of renting without paying a deposit he couldn't believe his luck. The 23-year-old was keen to move out of his family home to live with his partner - but they didn't have enough for the deposit of more than Â£1,000 to rent in Sussex. Eager to move quickly, the couple decided to rent through an agency which offered a deposit-free option. It wasn't until they had already put money down and were going through the paperwork that they realised the monthly fee to rent without a deposit was money they would never get back. Simon has been living there for more than a year - and has paid more than Â£500 in fees so far. He feels the agency did not highlight the fee was non-refundable. ""I think for something like that all of this should be explained to you before they even let you go for it - you shouldn't need to hunt down the answers,"" he adds. Simon says if the terms of the arrangement had been explained fully to him he would not have chosen to rent without a deposit and would have taken out a loan or carried on living with his family to save up to cover the upfront cost. ""Then at least we would get our deposit money back - rather than it going down the drain,"" he says. In response, the agency said it was sorry Simon felt the terms of its deposit-free option were not explained clearly enough but insisted there was clear communication from branch staff by email and he had signed a document confirming he understood the terms. It said the terms were ""made clear at every stage of the rental process"". Simon says he now regrets renting without a deposit The property ombudsman, Katrine Sporle, whose office resolves disputes between consumers and property agents, says other renters have had similar experiences. She says one tenant was forced to pay an administration fee to switch to a traditional deposit - even though they said they had not understood the terms of the deposit-free option. Others were told they had to use a deposit-free scheme to rent with an agency. Government guidance for England,externalsays a landlord or agent cannot insist a tenant uses an alternative to a traditional deposit, but it can be offered as an option. Ms Sporle says deposit-free options are not necessarily a bad thing but agents should ensure tenants understand the terms. David Cox, chief executive of ARLA Propertymark, which represents letting agents, says it welcomes anything which helps renters struggling to pay a new deposit before they get their previous one back. However, he says, it is important tenants understand fees for deposit-free schemes are generally non-refundable. Ms Laming says tenants may be tempted by the schemes with the average deposit at more than Â£1,000 Campaign group Generation Rent says some tenants feel under pressure to accept a deposit-free option in a competitive renting market. Letting agents can earn commission from selling the products and schemes owned by agents themselves can also be lucrative. The group's Georgie Laming says some agents see this as an income opportunitysince the majority of letting fees were banned in June last year. And there are now at least eight products on the market, with differing terms, which she says can prove confusing. Some charge tenants as much as Â£100 to dispute a damage claim from their landlord - a fee which does not exist for traditional deposits, which are held in a government-backed scheme. Ms Laming says she can understand why tenants might be tempted by deposit-free renting whenthe average up-front deposit in England and Wales is Â£1,108,external. However, she recommends looking at other options - as some councils and employers may provide interest-free loans to cover deposits. The governmentalso plans to introduce a ""lifetime deposit""to let renters transfer some of the deposit paid for a previous tenancy to the next. This would make it easier for renters to move without having to pay a new deposit before they get their previous one back - although it would not help first-time renters.

"Heavy rains have battered countries across Europe, including France Severe warnings have been issued across parts of northern Europe as Storm Ciara sweeps across the continent. High winds and heavy rain continue to batter areas of Ireland, France, Belgium, Switzerland, the Netherlands, Germany, Luxembourg and Scandinavia. The storm led to travel disruptions and the cancellation of several public events over the weekend. Forecasters predict it will continue to move south-eastwards, bringing gusts of over 90mph (145km/h) in some areas. In Ireland, around 14,000 homes and businesses were left without power as the country begins counting ballots for its general election. Organisers also cancelled an opening ceremony to mark the beginning of Galway's year as the European Capital of Culture, citing public safety. Floods and travel disruption in UK as Storm Ciara hits A history of UK named storms Over in Denmark, a woman and a child had to be rescued from the North Sea after they were swept into the water while walking along a pier. High winds have also brought severe disruption around the continent France issued amber warnings - its second-highest level - for 42 regions of the country, including Normandy, the Ardennes and Lorraine. People in the country have been warned to stay away from coastal and wooded areas, several cities have closed off parks and seaside promenades. Forecasters in Norway, meanwhile, have issued red warnings - their highest risk level - for some southern and western areas due to concerns about high seas. Severe weather has disrupted trains and flights in several major European cities These same concerns have also led to the suspension of ferry services in the English Channel. Gale force winds grounded hundreds of flights in Germany, Belgium and the Netherlands. Frankfurt, Brussels and Amsterdam Schipol were among the airports affected. German railway firm Deutsche Bahn also warned of severe disruptions in the north of the country. Storm Ciara is known as Elsa in Norway, and Sabine in Germany and Switzerland Storm Ciara - known as Elsa in Norway, and Sabine in Germany and Switzerland - is the most severe storm to hit the continent so far this year. In recent years, several national forecasters have adopted the practice of naming large storms to help the public monitor severe weather.

"Ballot boxes are opened at the RDS in Dublin at the start of the Irish general election count on Sunday Sinn FÃ©in president Mary Lou McDonald has described the Irish general election as ""something of a revolution in the ballot box"". Counting is continuing and the first results have come in, with Sinn FÃ©in winning the most first preference votes. With all first preferences counted, it has 24.5% compared to 22.2% for Fianna FÃ¡il and 20.9% for Fine Gael. No one party will win enough seats for an outright majority. Before the election, both Fine Gael and Fianna FÃ¡il ruled out forming a government with Sinn FÃ©in, citing its tax policies and IRA past as deterrents. On Sunday evening taoiseach (Irish PM) and Fine Gael leader Leo Varadkar said it would be ""challenging"" to form a government. Fianna FÃ¡il leader MicheÃ¡l Martin did not rule out working with Sinn FÃ©in, but said ""significant incompatibilities"" still existed. Follow live updates Profile of Ireland's political parties Polling in the election closed at 22:00 local time on Saturday. Ballot boxes from across the 39 constituencies were opened at 09:00 on Sunday. Many counts have finished for the night and will resume at 10:00 on Monday, but some are continuing. Sinn FÃ©in ran 42 candidates across the 39 multi-seat constituencies, about half that of both Fine Gael and Fianna FÃ¡il, which will have a knock-on effect on the number of seats it can secure in the 160-seat DÃ¡il (Irish parliament) where 80 seats are needed for a majority.

Before the election both Fine Gael and Fianna FÃ¡il said they would not enter coalition with Sinn FÃ©in. Arriving at the RDS count centre in Dublin on Sunday afternoon, Sinn FÃ©in leader Mary Lou McDonald said she was exploring options to see if it would be possible to form a government without either Fine Gael or Fianna FÃ¡il. Fine Gael leader Leo Varadkar said his party has consistently ruled out forming a coalition with Sinn FÃ©in ""in large part because of their policies in relation to crime, tax and the way the economy and society should be run and also our deep concerns about their democratic structures. ""We don't believe a coalition between Sinn FÃ©in and Fine Gael is a viable option,"" he said. He said a ""forced marriage would not result in a good government."" Fianna FÃ¡il leader MicheÃ¡l Martin did not rule out working with Sinn FÃ©in, but said ""significant incompatibilities"" still existed.

Many early victories have gone to Sinn FÃ©in - with no part of the country looking untouched by the party's surge. While the general picture is becoming clear - the final numbers will be determined by the process of numerical preferences trickling down through the various stages of the counts. Sinn FÃ©in surpluses will be very much in play here - as the party was only running one candidate in many constituencies, the destination of the transfers from the successful runners is set to have an impact on what other parties take the seats. The latest seat projection by University College Dublin, for RTÃ, puts Fianna Fail as the largest party on 45 seats - with Sinn FÃ©in on 37 and Fine Gael on 36. Plenty of counting is still to come. Fine Gael has been in government since 2011, firstly with the Labour Party and then with independents and with a confidence and supply deal with Fianna FÃ¡il. It looks set to lose seats for the second election in a row, but that does not necessarily rule it out of forming another government. Its share of first precence votes dropped from 25.5% at the last election to 20.9%. Party leader Leo Varadkar reiterated that he did not want to enter into government with Sinn FÃ©in and said Ms McDonald had not been in contact with him.

"Concerns have been raised over ""deposit-free"" renting being mis-sold to tenants who do not understand the costs involved. The option allows renters to pay a smaller, generally non-refundable fee in place of a traditional deposit. Companies and letting agents offering it say it reduces upfront costs. But campaign groups and the ombudsman have warned some are pushing deposit-free options without making it clear they could cost renters more over time. A traditional deposit is typically up to five weeks' rent - but this is refunded at the end of the tenancy, minus any deductions for damage or unpaid rent. With deposit-free options, renters pay less initially - usually a one-off payment equivalent to one week's rent or a monthly fee. But this is generally non-refundable and cannot be used to pay for damages. 'I was charged illegal fees by my letting agent' Where does rent hit young people the hardest? When Simon first heard about the possibility of renting without paying a deposit he couldn't believe his luck. The 23-year-old was keen to move out of his family home to live with his partner - but they didn't have enough for the deposit of more than Â£1,000 to rent in Sussex. Eager to move quickly, the couple decided to rent through an agency which offered a deposit-free option. It wasn't until they had already put money down and were going through the paperwork that they realised the monthly fee to rent without a deposit was money they would never get back. Simon has been living there for more than a year - and has paid more than Â£500 in fees so far. He feels the agency did not highlight the fee was non-refundable. ""I think for something like that all of this should be explained to you before they even let you go for it - you shouldn't need to hunt down the answers,"" he adds. Simon says if the terms of the arrangement had been explained fully to him he would not have chosen to rent without a deposit and would have taken out a loan or carried on living with his family to save up to cover the upfront cost. ""Then at least we would get our deposit money back - rather than it going down the drain,"" he says. In response, the agency said it was sorry Simon felt the terms of its deposit-free option were not explained clearly enough but insisted there was clear communication from branch staff by email and he had signed a document confirming he understood the terms. It said the terms were ""made clear at every stage of the rental process"". Simon says he now regrets renting without a deposit The property ombudsman, Katrine Sporle, whose office resolves disputes between consumers and property agents, says other renters have had similar experiences. She says one tenant was forced to pay an administration fee to switch to a traditional deposit - even though they said they had not understood the terms of the deposit-free option. Others were told they had to use a deposit-free scheme to rent with an agency. Government guidance for England,externalsays a landlord or agent cannot insist a tenant uses an alternative to a traditional deposit, but it can be offered as an option. Ms Sporle says deposit-free options are not necessarily a bad thing but agents should ensure tenants understand the terms. David Cox, chief executive of ARLA Propertymark, which represents letting agents, says it welcomes anything which helps renters struggling to pay a new deposit before they get their previous one back. However, he says, it is important tenants understand fees for deposit-free schemes are generally non-refundable. Ms Laming says tenants may be tempted by the schemes with the average deposit at more than Â£1,000 Campaign group Generation Rent says some tenants feel under pressure to accept a deposit-free option in a competitive renting market. Letting agents can earn commission from selling the products and schemes owned by agents themselves can also be lucrative. The group's Georgie Laming says some agents see this as an income opportunitysince the majority of letting fees were banned in June last year. And there are now at least eight products on the market, with differing terms, which she says can prove confusing. Some charge tenants as much as Â£100 to dispute a damage claim from their landlord - a fee which does not exist for traditional deposits, which are held in a government-backed scheme. Ms Laming says she can understand why tenants might be tempted by deposit-free renting whenthe average up-front deposit in England and Wales is Â£1,108,external. However, she recommends looking at other options - as some councils and employers may provide interest-free loans to cover deposits. The governmentalso plans to introduce a ""lifetime deposit""to let renters transfer some of the deposit paid for a previous tenancy to the next. This would make it easier for renters to move without having to pay a new deposit before they get their previous one back - although it would not help first-time renters. Worries among tenants over deposit return Lettings fee ban brings cheer to tenants 'I was charged illegal fees by my letting agent' 'Landlords treat us students like we're dumb kids' Where does rent hit young people the hardest?

"The Labour party has formally reported members of Sir Keir Starmer's leadership campaign team to the Information Commissioner, accusing them of hacking into the party's membership database, the BBC has learned. The allegations were made against two members of Sir Keir's team - one of them is his compliance official. They were passed to the Information Commissioner's Office on Thursday. Sir Keir and his team said the claims were ""utter nonsense"". The allegations are serious, and the confrontation has engulfed the campaign in bitter recrimination. The Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) is the UK's independent body set up to uphold information rights and enforce data protection legislation. The watchdog has the power to fine any organisation found to have misused data in any way. The ICO has confirmed it had received a report of a membership database breach, and would make inquiries. But I understand from multiple sources the Starmer team members were accused of what's called ""data-scraping"" - seeking to obtain certain information from a wider set of data. Late last night, Sir Keir wrote to the party flatly denying any wrongdoing by his team members. He insisted they were investigating a means of penetrating the database - called Dialogue - with no intention to use it. 100 years of Labour's ups and downs How Labour leadership race suddenly turned ugly Who will be Labour's next leader? Supporters of Sir Keir, who currently has the support of twice as many local Labour parties than any other candidate, have suggested they were now victims of a politically motivated effort to damage him and his campaign. Jenny Chapman, the former Labour MP who is chairing Sir Keir's campaign, said no-one on the team had the ""capacity"" to hack into any of the party's databases and ""they wouldn't do it anyway"". This video can not be played Jenny Chapman on data breach claims: ""It's utter, utter nonsense"" ""It's a very serious accusation and that is why I am here to defend it,"" she told BBC Radio 5live's Pienaar's Politics. ""This isn't even a situation where you say 'some over-enthusiastic young volunteers may have done it'. It didn't happen."" Ms Chapman suggested the allegations had only surfaced after her team had alerted Labour officials last week to what they believed was potentially a ""very serious"" data protection breach by the rival campaign of Rebecca Long-Bailey. It emerged last week that Ms Long-Bailey's campaign circulated links to volunteers capable of allowing them access to Labour Party phone banks. The campaign said it acted innocently but Ms Chapman said she believed ""something wrong"" had taken place. ""We wrote to the Labour Party... and we thought that was the end of it as far as we were concerned. And the next thing you know, a couple of people on our campaign get letters saying 'actually we think you have done something wrong'. She added: ""Labour members want a fair contest. Whoever decided to send these threatening letters to people on the Starmer campaign and then leak it to the BBC are not really doing the Labour Party or their preferred candidate any favours."" Labour said it had written to Sir Keir and his three leadership rivals to ""remind them of their obligations under the law and to seek assurances that membership data will not be misused"". ""The Labour Party takes its legal responsibilities for data protection - and the security and integrity of its data and systems - extremely seriously."" It emerged last week the rival campaign of Rebecca Long-Bailey had circulated links to volunteers capable of allowing access to the membership database - her team say done innocently. Under the party's leadership rules, any candidate who makes it to the final stage of the contest later this month will be entitled to receive details of party membership and registered supporter lists, containing names, telephone numbers and postal addresses. Sir Keir, Ms Long-Bailey and Lisa Nandy have already qualified after getting sufficient support from trade unions and other bodies affiliated to the party. Emily Thornberry has yet to do so. It is understood all the eligible candidates are being required to provide guarantees that the information will be stored securely and processed lawfully before it is given to them.

"This video can not be played Liu Xiaoming: ""I think what they are doing is a kind of a witch-hunt."" China's ambassador to the UK, Liu Xiaoming, says Tory politicians opposed to Huawei playing a role in the UK's 5G network are conducting ""a witch-hunt"". Some senior Conservatives have writtento Tory MPs to raise concerns about the government's decision to give Huawei a role in the network. The group, including four ex-cabinet ministers, want ""high-risk"" vendors ruled out now, or phased out over time. But Mr Liu told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show ""they were totally wrong"". ""I think what they are doing is a kind of a witch-hunt,"" he said. ""Huawei is a private-owned company, nothing to do with the Chinese government... the only problem they have is they are a Chinese company."" Several senior Conservatives have warned Huawei involvement in the UK's next generation mobile internet network poses a security risk and could lead to the first significant Commons rebellion against Boris Johnson's government. But Mr Liu said the firm operated totally independently of the Chinese state and was a leader in the field of 5G. What is Huawei and how could it be a security threat? Where is Huawei 5G being blocked? Senior Tories want Huawei excluded from UK 5G ""The reason why the [UK] prime minister decided to keep Huawei is he has a very ambitious plan for the UK, he wants to have 5G coverage in the UK by 2025, and Huawei can help."" But he criticised the 35% cap that the government had put on Huawei's involvement, saying it was not in keeping with the principle of a ""free economy"". And, when asked about President Trump being unhappy with the UK, he said ""I will leave the prime minister to deal with President Trump"". Mr Liu said: ""The UK can only be great when it has own independent foreign policy.  I hope the prime minister will stay with the decision because I think it's in interest of the UK and maintaining Britain's image as most open and free market economy in the world."" Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab has said the Huawei decision followed a ""rigorous"" review by security experts and that the firm's involvement would be restricted. But the senior Conservatives have said there are alternatives to the Chinese firm. The letter from Sir Iain Duncan Smith, Owen Paterson, David Davis, Damian Green, Tobias Ellwood and Bob Seely, which has been seen by the BBC, says some MPs were ""working to find a better solution"". ""We are seeking to identify a means by which we ensure that only trusted vendors are allowed as primary contractors into our critical national infrastructure,"" it says. ""Trusted vendors would be companies from countries that have fair market competition, rule of law, respect human rights, data privacy and non-coercive government agencies."" The signatories say they want the government to ""rule out hi-tech from untrusted, high-risk vendors"" in the UK's infrastructure, or to ensure future legislation includes ""sunset clauses"" to limit the length of time such companies can be used. The letter comes after US vice-president Mike Pence said the US was ""profoundly disappointed"" with the UK's decision. This video can not be played How will the Huawei 5G deal affect me? The UK government has saidrestrictions would be in place on Huawei's rolein the 5G network. These include: banning Huawei from supplying kit to ""sensitive parts"" of the network, only allowing it to account for 35% of the kit in a network's periphery, and excluding the firm's equipment from areas near military bases and nuclear sites. But Sir Iain and the others behind the letter have also cited examples of other countries which they said had already rejected using Huawei in their 5G networks at all, including Australia, the US and Japan.

"The proposal to make discrimination on the grounds of sexual identity or orientation illegal has proved controversial Voters in Switzerland have backed a proposal to make discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and sexual identity illegal. The result - 63.1% in favour to 36.9% against - is a huge boost for Switzerland's LGBT community. It had argued Swiss law on the issue lagged far behind other countries in Europe. Opponents of the new law argued it could restrict free speech. In Switzerland, discrimination because of race or religion is already illegal. In the run up to the vote, campaigners had said they thought the result would be tight, and that a yes vote of more than 60% was unlikely. Sunday's outcome shows public opinion is far more receptive to strengthening anti-discrimination legislation than analysts had predicted. Why are some places gay-friendly and not others? 'I quit my family and I'm happier for it' Pink Cross Switzerland said: ""The result proves a strong sign of acceptance for lesbians, gays and bisexuals. After the clear yes, the LGBTI community will use this momentum to achieve the consistent implementation of the penal code and to enforce marriage equality."" A bill to legalise same-sex marriage is currently on its way through parliament. ""Many Swiss people tend to overrate how modern our country is,"" explains Anna Rosenwasser of the Swiss Lesbian Organisation. She points out that onthe Rainbow Map of 49 countries' respect for LGBT rights,external, Switzerland ranks just 23rd. ""It might be rich, but it's really not modern yet. We have no laws concerning public discrimination based on sexual orientation."" To support her argument that the lack of legal protection causes harm to the gay community, Ms Rosenwasser cites suicide rates: ""Amongst queer people in Switzerland, it is five times higher compared to heterosexual people. That's quite something, it shows how we are not feeling safe yet."" Anna Rosenwasser (L) says Switzerland needs to modernise ""We don't even know if jokes about gays will be allowed,"" Benjamin Fischer of the right-wing Swiss People's Party told Swiss television. ""Some say yes, some say no they will be punishable. We live in a country with freedom of expression, people should be allowed to think and say what they like, even if it's a bit stupid or tasteless."" There was opposition too from some religious groups. Although Switzerland's reformed church backed the new law, the Swiss Evangelical Alliance, which has significant support in rural areas, was sceptical. Gay bishop will not push for same-sex marriage Why Chinaâs LGBT hide their identities at Lunar New Year ""Our churches see the marriage of a man and a woman as the only couple they want to marry,"" explains the general secretary of the alliance, Marc Jost. ""We just want to be free to say: 'Ok, we want to privilege the marriage of a man and a woman.' And we don't want to be at risk if we share this opinion, and treat other couples in a different way."" Marc Jost is not comfortable with the moves to legalise same-sex marriage, despite family circumstances that might have encouraged him towards a different point of view. Marc Jost (L) does not agree with same-sex marriage even though his father Samuel (R) is gay ""My father is gay and lives in a civil union, and of course we disagree on very personal questions,"" he explains. ""But we still have a good relationship. It's important to show it's possible to peacefully disagree on important questions in life."" Supporters of the law argued that no-one would be prosecuted for private comments, or for religious beliefs. But, they say, the law should protect the LGBT community from public discrimination, and aggression. Members of the gay communityinterviewed by Switzerland's 20 Minuten paper,externalsaid they were often physically attacked, some even hospitalised. Other groups of young men told the same paper they felt it was ok to hit openly gay couples, even suggesting they could be ""cured with a few punches"". This is the point, says campaigner Jessica Zuber, where the argument over freedom of expression goes too far.

The film about gay love shaking up Georgia The region which legislates who you can love That would be an important sign for Anna Rosenwasser, who knows what it is like to feel uneasy about expressing her identity. ""I actually dated men for 10 years. Now I have a girlfriend, and we are a cuddly couple, we do hold hands. But there are situations where we will not hold hands, in order to feel more safe.

"Boris Johnson and Home Secretary Priti Patel are expected to set out their immigration reforms, including a drop in salary threshold for some migrants, at a cabinet meeting on Friday. Currently, skilled migrants from outside the EU need to have a job offer with a minimum salary of Â£30,000. The BBC understands ministers plan to lower this threshold to Â£25,600. Workers from the EU will face the same rules once the transition period for leaving the EU ends on 31 December. Workers earning less might be allowed to make up ""points"" elsewhere in order to be granted a visa if they work in a sector with a skills shortage. Points will also be awarded for speaking good English or for having an outstanding educational background. The Home Office said it would set out the details of what would be a ""firmer and fairer new system"" in due course. How could a UK points-based immigration system work? BBC Briefing: Your guide to immigration ""We will deliver on the people's priorities by introducing a points-based immigration system from 2021 to attract the brightest and best talent from around the world, while cutting low-skilled immigration and bringing overall numbers down,"" it said. Last month the independentMigration Advisory Committee (MAC),externalmade a series of recommendations for how the system should look from 2021, including lowering the salary threshold for skilled migrants to Â£25,600 in order to help recruit teachers and skilled NHS staff. The committee also criticised the UK's current complex immigration system, where non-EU workers can attempt to qualify for a range of visas. The prime minister made it a key pledge during the election campaign to introduce a points-based immigration scheme, based on Australia's, for when existing EU freedom of movement rules end. Under those rules, workers from the EU and European Economic Area countries can come to the UK to live or work without a visa. The MAC has said there is no such thing as a ""perfect"" immigration system, with benefits and trade-offs in various parts of the economy. It said whatever policies the government decides, it must work quickly to get something in place for after the transition period ends.

"Evacuees from coronavirus-hit city Wuhan have arrived for two weeks quarantine in Milton Keynes A fourth person has tested positive for coronavirus in the UK, England's chief medical officer has said. The new case is a known contact of a previous British patient, and caught the virus in France. It comes after around 200 British and foreign nationals evacuated from Wuhan on the UK's final rescue flight arrived at RAF Brize Norton on Sunday. There have been more than 37,000 cases of the virus globally, mostly in China, where it originated. The death toll for coronavirus has nowovertaken that of the Sars epidemic in 2003, according to health officials in China, reaching 813. In 2003, 774 people were killed by Sars. In a statement on Sunday, Professor Chris Whitty, chief medical officer for England, said the latest UK patient has been transferred to a specialist NHS centre at the Royal Free hospital in north London. ""We are now using robust infection control measures to prevent any possible further spread of the virus,"" he said. ""The NHS is extremely well prepared to manage these cases and treat them, and we are working quickly to identify any further contacts the patient has had. ""This patient followed NHS advice by self-isolating rather than going to A&E."" Meanwhile, a British man has been diagnosed with coronavirus in Majorca after contact with a carrier in France. WHO warns against coronavirus 'trolls' A visual guide to the coronavirus outbreak Coronavirus: Your travel rights explained The repatriation flight arrived at RAF Brize Norton at around 07:30 GMT on Sunday, carrying more than 200 British and foreign nationals. The Foreign Office said the flight was the second and last flight chartered by the government out of Wuhan, the city where the new coronavirus emerged. The passengers comprised 105 Britons and their family members as well as 95 Europeans. A total of 13 staff and medics were also on board the flight. Evacuees were taken on eight coaches to a Milton Keynes conference centre and hotel for 14 days of quarantine. NHS staff in blue scrubs, gloves and masks met passengers as they disembarked from the coaches at around 10:30 GMT. Passengers on the repatriation flight included UK and foreign nationals The UK's ambassador to Beijing, Dame Barbara Woodward, told the BBC that two British people who wanted to join the flight were not allowed to board after failing temperature checks in China. Elsewhere, the government in the Balearic Islands confirmed on Sunday a British man has tested positive for coronavirus. He was admitted to hospital in Palma on Friday, along with his wife and two daughters. The rest of his family have tested negative for the virus. The local health ministry said an investigation into cases that may have had contact with the man has begun. More than 100 UK nationals and family members have already been evacuated to Britain on flights chartered by the UK and other countries. They are being held in quarantine at Arrowe Park Hospital in Wirral. The latest returnees will be housed at Kents Hill Park conference centre and hotel, where they will remain in isolation for two weeks - the incubation period of the virus - to ensure they are not infected. At the hotel, they will have access to Netflix, magazines, books, baby equipment including highchairs, children's toys and games, mobile phones, and tablets for reading, games, and browsing the internet, the NHS said. Clothing and toiletries have been laid out for their arrival. Passengers on the previous flight said they were only allowed to travel with a 15kg (33lb) cabin bag. Clothing supplies are among the provisions laid out for quarantined passengers The flight follows the decision by the Foreign Office on 4 February toadvise all Britons to leave China if they can. British Airways and Virgin Atlantic have suspended all flights to and from mainland China, while other carriers continue to operate flights between the UK and China. China's National Health Commission said total cases in the country from the virus had reached 37,198 on Sunday morning. Outside of China, 288 cases have been confirmed in 24 countries, according to the World Health Organization. All the fatal cases have been in China and Hong Kong apart from one in the Philippines. In the UK, the Department of Health and Social Care said that 686 people in the UK have been tested for coronavirus as of Saturday afternoon. The virus causes severe short-term infection of the airways, and symptoms usually start with a fever, followed by a dry cough. Most people are likely to fully recover - just as they would from the flu. Two of the UK coronavirus cases - both Chinese nationals - are being treated at the Royal Victoria Infirmary in Newcastle. After the third case was confirmed, it emerged that the British man had been exposed to the virus in Singapore and stopped at a ski resort in France before returning home. There, five more Britons - four adults and a nine-year-old boy - staying at the same chalet in the Alpstested positive for the virus. A student at Portslade Aldridge Community Academy in Brighton is self-isolating for 14 days following advice from Public Health England. Were you evacuated?

"Ballot boxes are opened at the RDS in Dublin at the start of the Irish general election count on Sunday Sinn FÃ©in president Mary Lou McDonald has described the Irish general election as ""something of a revolution in the ballot box"". Counting is continuing and the first results have come in, with Sinn FÃ©in winning the most first preference votes. With all first preferences counted, it has 24.5% compared to 22.2% for Fianna FÃ¡il and 20.9% for Fine Gael. No one party will win enough seats for an outright majority. Before the election, both Fine Gael and Fianna FÃ¡il ruled out forming a government with Sinn FÃ©in, citing its tax policies and IRA past as deterrents. On Sunday evening taoiseach (Irish PM) and Fine Gael leader Leo Varadkar said it would be ""challenging"" to form a government. Fianna FÃ¡il leader MicheÃ¡l Martin did not rule out working with Sinn FÃ©in, but said ""significant incompatibilities"" still existed. Follow live updates Profile of Ireland's political parties Polling in the election closed at 22:00 local time on Saturday. Ballot boxes from across the 39 constituencies were opened at 09:00 on Sunday. Many counts have finished for the night and will resume at 10:00 on Monday, but some are continuing. Sinn FÃ©in ran 42 candidates across the 39 multi-seat constituencies, about half that of both Fine Gael and Fianna FÃ¡il, which will have a knock-on effect on the number of seats it can secure in the 160-seat DÃ¡il (Irish parliament) where 80 seats are needed for a majority. From left: MicheÃ¡l Martin (Fianna FÃ¡il), Leo Varadkar (Fine Gael) and Mary Lou McDonald (Sinn FÃ©in) Once the final number of seats for each party is known, leaders will try to form a coalition government in order to avoid another general election. Before the election both Fine Gael and Fianna FÃ¡il said they would not enter coalition with Sinn FÃ©in. Arriving at the RDS count centre in Dublin on Sunday afternoon, Sinn FÃ©in leader Mary Lou McDonald said she was exploring options to see if it would be possible to form a government without either Fine Gael or Fianna FÃ¡il. Fine Gael leader Leo Varadkar said his party has consistently ruled out forming a coalition with Sinn FÃ©in ""in large part because of their policies in relation to crime, tax and the way the economy and society should be run and also our deep concerns about their democratic structures. ""We don't believe a coalition between Sinn FÃ©in and Fine Gael is a viable option,"" he said. He said a ""forced marriage would not result in a good government."" Fianna FÃ¡il leader MicheÃ¡l Martin did not rule out working with Sinn FÃ©in, but said ""significant incompatibilities"" still existed. He said reports suggested that his party ""would be the largest"". He added that he was a ""democrat"" and respected the vote of the people. Sinn FÃ©in's Donnchadh Ã Laoghaire celebrates being the first TD elected Followingthe last election in 2016 Sinn FÃ©in had 23 seatsin the DÃ¡il (Irish parliament). There are 160 seats up for election this time around, and Sinn FÃ©in is set to dramatically increase how many it holds after it won the most first preference votes. Ms McDonald said this election was about ""change"". She topped the poll in her four-seat Dublin Central constituency. ""The frustration people have felt for a long time with the two-party system, whereby Fine Gael and Fianna FÃ¡il handed the baton of power between each other - that's now over,"" she said. ""We now have a very substantial mandate."" She said she was exploring options to see to see if it was possible to form a government without Fine Gael and Fianna FÃ¡il. This video can not be played 'Excluding Sinn FÃ©in would be wrong' By Chris Page, BBC News Ireland Correspondent Sunday evening is seeing a cascade of results from across the country. Many early victories have gone to Sinn FÃ©in - with no part of the country looking untouched by the party's surge. While the general picture is becoming clear - the final numbers will be determined by the process of numerical preferences trickling down through the various stages of the counts. Sinn FÃ©in surpluses will be very much in play here - as the party was only running one candidate in many constituencies, the destination of the transfers from the successful runners is set to have an impact on what other parties take the seats. The latest seat projection by University College Dublin, for RTÃ, puts Fianna Fail as the largest party on 45 seats - with Sinn FÃ©in on 37 and Fine Gael on 36. Plenty of counting is still to come. Fine Gael has been in government since 2011, firstly with the Labour Party and then with independents and with a confidence and supply deal with Fianna FÃ¡il. It looks set to lose seats for the second election in a row, but that does not necessarily rule it out of forming another government. Its share of first precence votes dropped from 25.5% at the last election to 20.9%. Party leader Leo Varadkar reiterated that he did not want to enter into government with Sinn FÃ©in and said Ms McDonald had not been in contact with him. The taoiseach said he was ""not really"" disappointed that he did not top the poll in his own constituency. He did get an increase in his votes compared to the last election. He added it was now clear there was now a ""three-party system"". This video can not be played Leo Varadkar: 'My position on Sinn FÃ©in hasn't changed' Fianna FÃ¡il has been in government for more years than anyone else since Ireland became independent, but it has not been the ruling party since 2011. Earlier on Sunday MicheÃ¡l Martin said reports suggested his party ""would be the largest"" but that it was early days. He said there was a lot of ""volatility"", adding people who could not get elected in the local elections had been successful in this one. He said the most important thing when forming a government was ""compatibility in the programme for government"" and that formation of a government was going to be very difficult. Mr Martin added he was a ""democrat"" and respected the will of the people. Despite previously saying he would not govern with Sinn FÃ©in he has now not ruled that out. Fianna FÃ¡il leader MichÃ©al Martin and family at the St Anthony's boys' school polling station in Ballinlough, County Cork The Green Party is also set to increase the number of seats it holds. Green leader Eamon Ryan, who was elected on the first count for Dublin Bay South, said his party would play its part in talks to form a government. Ruth Coppinger from the left wing alliance Solidarity-People Before Profit lost her seat. Labour Party leader Brendan Howlin said it had not been a good day for his party as it had been squeezed by Sinn FÃ©in. The party's former leader Joan Burton lost her seat in Dublin West. She was first elected to the DÃ¡il in 1992. The Social Democrats co-leader Catherine Murphy said it was ""historic,"" saying there had been a ""seismic shift"". She said she knew there was a wind in the Sinn FÃ©in sail. Eamon Ryan was in an upbeat mood about his party's prospects The Green Party secured 7.1% of first preference votes, followed by Labour (4.4%), Social Democrats (2.9%), Solidarity-People Before Profit (2.6%). AontÃº (1.9%) independents (12.2%) and others (1.3%) accounted for the rest. Anexit poll,external- commissioned jointly by Irish national broadcasters RTÃ and TG4, as well as The Irish Times and University College Dublin suggested a move toward Sinn FÃ©in among younger voters, with the party receiving the largest number of first preference votes among 18-24 years olds (31.8%). The majority of voters over the age of 65 appear to have given their first preference to Fine Gael or Fianna FÃ¡il. Voting papers are organised at the counting centre at the RDS in Dublin on Sunday Ireland's elections are carried out under the proportional representation (PR) voting system, using the single transferable vote (STV). Voters wrote ""1"" opposite their first choice candidate, ""2"" opposite their second choice, ""3"" opposite their third choice and so on. This means that the picture presented when the first preference votes are counted does not completely reflect the final outcome. Newly elected TDs will gather on 20 February . The ceann comhairle, or speaker, is automatically re-elected. In most situations, the speaker does not vote, so a government will need 80 TDs to hold a majority.

"This video can not be played Liu Xiaoming: ""I think what they are doing is a kind of a witch-hunt."" China's ambassador to the UK, Liu Xiaoming, says Tory politicians opposed to Huawei playing a role in the UK's 5G network are conducting ""a witch-hunt"". Some senior Conservatives have writtento Tory MPs to raise concerns about the government's decision to give Huawei a role in the network. The group, including four ex-cabinet ministers, want ""high-risk"" vendors ruled out now, or phased out over time. But Mr Liu told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show ""they were totally wrong"". ""I think what they are doing is a kind of a witch-hunt,"" he said. ""Huawei is a private-owned company, nothing to do with the Chinese government... the only problem they have is they are a Chinese company."" Several senior Conservatives have warned Huawei involvement in the UK's next generation mobile internet network poses a security risk and could lead to the first significant Commons rebellion against Boris Johnson's government. But Mr Liu said the firm operated totally independently of the Chinese state and was a leader in the field of 5G. What is Huawei and how could it be a security threat? Where is Huawei 5G being blocked? Senior Tories want Huawei excluded from UK 5G ""The reason why the [UK] prime minister decided to keep Huawei is he has a very ambitious plan for the UK, he wants to have 5G coverage in the UK by 2025, and Huawei can help."" But he criticised the 35% cap that the government had put on Huawei's involvement, saying it was not in keeping with the principle of a ""free economy"". And, when asked about President Trump being unhappy with the UK, he said ""I will leave the prime minister to deal with President Trump"". Mr Liu said: ""The UK can only be great when it has own independent foreign policy.  I hope the prime minister will stay with the decision because I think it's in interest of the UK and maintaining Britain's image as most open and free market economy in the world."" Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab has said the Huawei decision followed a ""rigorous"" review by security experts and that the firm's involvement would be restricted. But the senior Conservatives have said there are alternatives to the Chinese firm. The letter from Sir Iain Duncan Smith, Owen Paterson, David Davis, Damian Green, Tobias Ellwood and Bob Seely, which has been seen by the BBC, says some MPs were ""working to find a better solution"". ""We are seeking to identify a means by which we ensure that only trusted vendors are allowed as primary contractors into our critical national infrastructure,"" it says. ""Trusted vendors would be companies from countries that have fair market competition, rule of law, respect human rights, data privacy and non-coercive government agencies."" The signatories say they want the government to ""rule out hi-tech from untrusted, high-risk vendors"" in the UK's infrastructure, or to ensure future legislation includes ""sunset clauses"" to limit the length of time such companies can be used. The letter comes after US vice-president Mike Pence said the US was ""profoundly disappointed"" with the UK's decision. This video can not be played How will the Huawei 5G deal affect me? The UK government has saidrestrictions would be in place on Huawei's rolein the 5G network. These include: banning Huawei from supplying kit to ""sensitive parts"" of the network, only allowing it to account for 35% of the kit in a network's periphery, and excluding the firm's equipment from areas near military bases and nuclear sites. But Sir Iain and the others behind the letter have also cited examples of other countries which they said had already rejected using Huawei in their 5G networks at all, including Australia, the US and Japan.

There have been more than 37,000 cases of the virus globally, mostly in China, where it originated. The death toll for coronavirus has nowovertaken that of the Sars epidemic in 2003, according to health officials in China, reaching 813. In 2003, 774 people were killed by Sars. In a statement on Sunday, Professor Chris Whitty, chief medical officer for England, said the latest UK patient has been transferred to a specialist NHS centre at the Royal Free hospital in north London. ""We are now using robust infection control measures to prevent any possible further spread of the virus,"" he said. ""The NHS is extremely well prepared to manage these cases and treat them, and we are working quickly to identify any further contacts the patient has had. ""This patient followed NHS advice by self-isolating rather than going to A&E."" Meanwhile, a British man has been diagnosed with coronavirus in Majorca after contact with a carrier in France. WHO warns against coronavirus 'trolls' A visual guide to the coronavirus outbreak Coronavirus: Your travel rights explained The repatriation flight arrived at RAF Brize Norton at around 07:30 GMT on Sunday, carrying more than 200 British and foreign nationals. The Foreign Office said the flight was the second and last flight chartered by the government out of Wuhan, the city where the new coronavirus emerged. The passengers comprised 105 Britons and their family members as well as 95 Europeans. A total of 13 staff and medics were also on board the flight. Evacuees were taken on eight coaches to a Milton Keynes conference centre and hotel for 14 days of quarantine. NHS staff in blue scrubs, gloves and masks met passengers as they disembarked from the coaches at around 10:30 GMT. Passengers on the repatriation flight included UK and foreign nationals The UK's ambassador to Beijing, Dame Barbara Woodward, told the BBC that two British people who wanted to join the flight were not allowed to board after failing temperature checks in China. Elsewhere, the government in the Balearic Islands confirmed on Sunday a British man has tested positive for coronavirus. He was admitted to hospital in Palma on Friday, along with his wife and two daughters. The rest of his family have tested negative for the virus. The local health ministry said an investigation into cases that may have had contact with the man has begun. More than 100 UK nationals and family members have already been evacuated to Britain on flights chartered by the UK and other countries. They are being held in quarantine at Arrowe Park Hospital in Wirral. The latest returnees will be housed at Kents Hill Park conference centre and hotel, where they will remain in isolation for two weeks - the incubation period of the virus - to ensure they are not infected. At the hotel, they will have access to Netflix, magazines, books, baby equipment including highchairs, children's toys and games, mobile phones, and tablets for reading, games, and browsing the internet, the NHS said. Clothing and toiletries have been laid out for their arrival. Passengers on the previous flight said they were only allowed to travel with a 15kg (33lb) cabin bag. Clothing supplies are among the provisions laid out for quarantined passengers The flight follows the decision by the Foreign Office on 4 February toadvise all Britons to leave China if they can. British Airways and Virgin Atlantic have suspended all flights to and from mainland China, while other carriers continue to operate flights between the UK and China. China's National Health Commission said total cases in the country from the virus had reached 37,198 on Sunday morning. Outside of China, 288 cases have been confirmed in 24 countries, according to the World Health Organization. All the fatal cases have been in China and Hong Kong apart from one in the Philippines. In the UK, the Department of Health and Social Care said that 686 people in the UK have been tested for coronavirus as of Saturday afternoon. The virus causes severe short-term infection of the airways, and symptoms usually start with a fever, followed by a dry cough. Most people are likely to fully recover - just as they would from the flu. Two of the UK coronavirus cases - both Chinese nationals - are being treated at the Royal Victoria Infirmary in Newcastle. After the third case was confirmed, it emerged that the British man had been exposed to the virus in Singapore and stopped at a ski resort in France before returning home. There, five more Britons - four adults and a nine-year-old boy - staying at the same chalet in the Alpstested positive for the virus. A student at Portslade Aldridge Community Academy in Brighton is self-isolating for 14 days following advice from Public Health England. Were you evacuated?

"The Labour party has formally reported members of Sir Keir Starmer's leadership campaign team to the Information Commissioner, accusing them of hacking into the party's membership database, the BBC has learned. The allegations were made against two members of Sir Keir's team - one of them is his compliance official. They were passed to the Information Commissioner's Office on Thursday. Sir Keir and his team said the claims were ""utter nonsense"". The allegations are serious, and the confrontation has engulfed the campaign in bitter recrimination. The Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) is the UK's independent body set up to uphold information rights and enforce data protection legislation. The watchdog has the power to fine any organisation found to have misused data in any way. The ICO has confirmed it had received a report of a membership database breach, and would make inquiries. But I understand from multiple sources the Starmer team members were accused of what's called ""data-scraping"" - seeking to obtain certain information from a wider set of data. Late last night, Sir Keir wrote to the party flatly denying any wrongdoing by his team members. He insisted they were investigating a means of penetrating the database - called Dialogue - with no intention to use it. 100 years of Labour's ups and downs How Labour leadership race suddenly turned ugly Who will be Labour's next leader? Supporters of Sir Keir, who currently has the support of twice as many local Labour parties than any other candidate, have suggested they were now victims of a politically motivated effort to damage him and his campaign. Jenny Chapman, the former Labour MP who is chairing Sir Keir's campaign, said no-one on the team had the ""capacity"" to hack into any of the party's databases and ""they wouldn't do it anyway"". This video can not be played Jenny Chapman on data breach claims: ""It's utter, utter nonsense"" ""It's a very serious accusation and that is why I am here to defend it,"" she told BBC Radio 5live's Pienaar's Politics. ""This isn't even a situation where you say 'some over-enthusiastic young volunteers may have done it'. It didn't happen."" Ms Chapman suggested the allegations had only surfaced after her team had alerted Labour officials last week to what they believed was potentially a ""very serious"" data protection breach by the rival campaign of Rebecca Long-Bailey. It emerged last week that Ms Long-Bailey's campaign circulated links to volunteers capable of allowing them access to Labour Party phone banks. The campaign said it acted innocently but Ms Chapman said she believed ""something wrong"" had taken place. ""We wrote to the Labour Party... and we thought that was the end of it as far as we were concerned. And the next thing you know, a couple of people on our campaign get letters saying 'actually we think you have done something wrong'. She added: ""Labour members want a fair contest. Whoever decided to send these threatening letters to people on the Starmer campaign and then leak it to the BBC are not really doing the Labour Party or their preferred candidate any favours."" Labour said it had written to Sir Keir and his three leadership rivals to ""remind them of their obligations under the law and to seek assurances that membership data will not be misused"". ""The Labour Party takes its legal responsibilities for data protection - and the security and integrity of its data and systems - extremely seriously."" It emerged last week the rival campaign of Rebecca Long-Bailey had circulated links to volunteers capable of allowing access to the membership database - her team say done innocently. Under the party's leadership rules, any candidate who makes it to the final stage of the contest later this month will be entitled to receive details of party membership and registered supporter lists, containing names, telephone numbers and postal addresses. Sir Keir, Ms Long-Bailey and Lisa Nandy have already qualified after getting sufficient support from trade unions and other bodies affiliated to the party. Emily Thornberry has yet to do so. It is understood all the eligible candidates are being required to provide guarantees that the information will be stored securely and processed lawfully before it is given to them.

"Universities need to be much clearer about whether they will contact parents if students have a mental health crisis, says a social mobility charity. My Big Career, which helps poorer youngsters apply to university, says families being informed is a ""lottery"". Following concerns over student suicides, some universities ask students if they want families to be contacted if there are serious worries. But there is no requirement for universities to notify parents. Charity founder Deborah Streatfield says students and their families can be left unsure what will happen if there are mental health problems. ""Many are quite scared when a young person moves away from home for the first time,"" she said. ""If anything were to happen over the academic years, whether mental or physical illness, the university is under no obligation to inform anyone. ""It is a lottery for parents to know which universities have introduced this vital support."" Students want parents to be told in mental health crisis 'I had the call every parent dreads' Mental health services failed Liverpool student 'Neglect' a factor in Bristol student suicide Universities 'in dark' over student mental health needs In the wake of student suicides at the University of Bristol, the university introduced an ""opt-in"" system in which students can give consent for a parent, guardian or friend to be contacted if there are ""serious concerns"" about their well-being. This year 93% of students at Bristol chose to opt-in to let family or friends be contacted - and there were 36 cases last year in which contacts were made, such as incidents of self-harm, concern about not being seen in halls of residence or deteriorations in mental health. An inquest last year into the death of a University of Liverpool student, Ceara Thacker, heard that her family had not been informed about a previous suicide attempt three months before her death. Students are adults and so have a right to confidentiality - which means universities have to ask if they will waive this privacy. But for students currently making choices about university applications, there is no simple way to see which universities might have an arrangement for families to be contacted. The higher education regulator, the Office for Students, says it does not keep a list of which universities offer such an option. Admissions service Ucas does not have a list for students or parents of which universities offer such an opt-in for contacting families. A spokesman says students are encouraged to declare any mental health conditions when they apply. In last year's entry, there were almost 16,000 students who declared a mental health problem - a 19% increase on the previous year - and more than double the number in 2015. The admissions service says when a student discloses a mental health condition, they will usually be contacted by a ""trained individual"" from the university to ""discuss what support the student needs"". Universities UK is currently working on guidance to give to universities over contacting family - and says it has been consulting mental health and legal experts and students and parents. The charity, My Big Career, is calling for all universities to offer an opt-in for parents. But Universities UK says this has to be balanced against concerns that involving students' families could make matters worse. The Department for Education says it has asked the university sector to consider how to better share information with students' families. ""Universities should work to improve how they involve family members in mental health support, while ensuring that students' best interests are central to any decisions about their care,"" said a department spokesman.

"Boris Johnson and Home Secretary Priti Patel are expected to set out their immigration reforms, including a drop in salary threshold for some migrants, at a cabinet meeting on Friday. Currently, skilled migrants from outside the EU need to have a job offer with a minimum salary of Â£30,000. The BBC understands ministers plan to lower this threshold to Â£25,600. Workers from the EU will face the same rules once the transition period for leaving the EU ends on 31 December. Workers earning less might be allowed to make up ""points"" elsewhere in order to be granted a visa if they work in a sector with a skills shortage. Points will also be awarded for speaking good English or for having an outstanding educational background. The Home Office said it would set out the details of what would be a ""firmer and fairer new system"" in due course. How could a UK points-based immigration system work? BBC Briefing: Your guide to immigration ""We will deliver on the people's priorities by introducing a points-based immigration system from 2021 to attract the brightest and best talent from around the world, while cutting low-skilled immigration and bringing overall numbers down,"" it said. Last month the independentMigration Advisory Committee (MAC),externalmade a series of recommendations for how the system should look from 2021, including lowering the salary threshold for skilled migrants to Â£25,600 in order to help recruit teachers and skilled NHS staff. The committee also criticised the UK's current complex immigration system, where non-EU workers can attempt to qualify for a range of visas. The prime minister made it a key pledge during the election campaign to introduce a points-based immigration scheme, based on Australia's, for when existing EU freedom of movement rules end. Under those rules, workers from the EU and European Economic Area countries can come to the UK to live or work without a visa. The MAC has said there is no such thing as a ""perfect"" immigration system, with benefits and trade-offs in various parts of the economy. It said whatever policies the government decides, it must work quickly to get something in place for after the transition period ends.
