"The man slipped handwritten notes pleading to bank customers to get help A Texas man who found himself trapped inside a cash machine slipped ""help me"" notes through the receipt slot. The man, who police say was working on a renovation of the bank, left his phone in his vehicle before getting stuck in the drive-thru ATM's vault. The unnamed workman was freed after shouting to ATM users, who continued withdrawing cash throughout his ordeal on Wednesday in Corpus Christi. Police thought it a hoax before kicking in a door to withdraw him. Corpus Christi Police Officer Richard Olden described hearing the man's shouts ""Sure enough, we can hear a little voice coming from the machine, so we're all thinking this is a joke, it's gotta be a joke,"" said police officer Richard Olden. One handwritten note slipped by the trapped man to a customer said: ""Please Help. I'm stuck in here, and I don't have my phone. Please call my boss."" The message included the employer's phone number. The man was freed after spending more than two hours inside the Bank of America machine. Officer Olden told local media: ""Everyone is okay, but you will never see this in your life, that somebody was stuck in the ATM, it was just crazy.""

"This video can not be played David Davis defends 'repeal bill' plans The Scottish and Welsh governments have threatened to block the key Brexit bill which will convert all existing EU laws into UK law. The repeal bill,external, published earlier, is also facing opposition from Labour and other parties in the Commons. Ministers are ""optimistic"" about getting it through and have promised an ""ongoing intense dialogue"" with the devolved administrations. No 10 said it had to be passed or ""there will be no laws"" after Brexit. Brexit Secretary David Davis called it ""one of the most significant pieces of legislation that has ever passed through Parliament"". He rejected claims ministers were giving themselves ""sweeping powers"" to make changes to laws as they are repatriated. It will be up to MPs if they want a say on the ""technical changes"" ministers plan to make to legislation, he told the BBC. What is the Repeal Bill all about? Brexit: All you need to to know EU stands firm on citizen rights UK could be 'associate' of EU nuclear body Labour says it will not support the bill in its current form and is demanding concessions in six areas, including the incorporation of the European Charter of Fundamental Rights into British law. The party wants guarantees workers' rights will be protected and also want curbs on the power of government ministers to alter legislation without full parliamentary scrutiny. Leader Jeremy Corbyn, who was in Brussels earlier for a meeting with the EU's chief negotiator Michel Barnier, said: ""Far too much of it seems to be a process where the government... will be able to bypass Parliament. ""We will make sure there is full parliamentary scrutiny. We have a Parliament where the government doesn't have a majority, we have a country which voted in two ways on Leave or Remain. ""The majority voted to leave and we respect that, but they didn't vote to lose jobs and they didn't vote to have Parliament ridden roughshod over."" Formally known as the European Union (Withdrawal) Bill, the draft legislation is a key plank of the government's Brexit strategy The first line of the bill says the European Communities Act 1972, which took Britain into the EU, will be ""repealed on exit day"" This will end the supremacy of EU law and stop the flow of new regulations from Brussels But all existing laws derived from the EU will continue to be in force - they can be changed or scrapped by further legislation The bill does not detail policies line-by-line but transfers all regulations into domestic law It gives the UK two years after Brexit to correct any ""deficiencies"" arising from the transfer The Conservatives are relying on Democratic Unionist Party support to win key votes after losing their Commons majority in the general election, but could face a revolt from Remain supporting backbenchers. BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg said there could be ""parliamentary guerrilla warfare"" on the bill, as opposition parties and ""Remainer Tories"" try to ""put their version of Brexit, not Theresa May's, on to the statute book"". The repeal bill is not expected to be debated by MPs until the Autumn, but will need to have been passed by the time the UK leaves the EU - which is due to happen in March 2019. But the Scottish and Welsh governments have to give ""legislative consent"" to the bill before it can become law - something they have said they are not willing to do. In a joint statement, first ministers Nicola Sturgeon and Carwyn Jones, who also met Mr Barnier, described the bill as a ""naked power-grab"" by Westminster that undermined the principles of devolution. They say the bill returns powers from Brussels solely to the UK government and Parliament and ""imposes new restrictions"" on the Scottish Parliament and the Welsh Assembly. Jeremy Corbyn presented Michel Barnier with an Arsenal shirt Ministers at Holyrood will not be able to amend EU rules in devolved areas such as agriculture and fisheries after Brexit until the UK Parliament and Scottish government have reached an agreement on them. UK Scottish Secretary David Mundell claimed the repeal bill would result in a powers ""bonanza"" for Holyrood - a comment described as ""ludicrous"" by the SNP. Corbyn meets chief EU negotiator Sturgeon: EU repeal bill a 'power grab' Warning over post-Brexit customs system Publish Brexit nuclear advice, MPs say Does it matter if the UK leaves Euratom? Theresa May's official spokeswoman said the repeal bill was a ""hugely important piece of legislation"" because ""we need to have a functioning statute book on the day we leave the EU"". The spokesman said First Secretary of State Damian Green had contacted the devolved administrations in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland and the government was confident of gaining their consent. Asked if there was a contingency plan if he didn't win their backing, the prime minister's official spokesman said ""not that I'm aware of"". Lib Dem leader Tim Farron, whose party is seeking to join forces with Labour and Tory rebels, said he was ""putting the government on warning"", promising a tougher test than than it faced when passing legislation authorising the UK's departure from the EU. ""If you found the Article 50 Bill difficult, you should be under no illusion, this will be hell,"" he said. Steve Baker, a minister in the Department for Exiting the European Union, said the government was ""ready"" for a fight over the bill but would also to ""listen to Parliament"". Speaking to BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg, Mr Davies predicted the bill ""may get amendments here and there"", saying he was open to suggestions from other parties for things that should be included. ""If we've missed something and got something wrong, then we'll debate that in the House of Commons,"" he said. ""That's how this works."" Mr Davis also insisted contingency plans were being made in case the UK and the EU cannot agree a Brexit deal. ""We are planning for all options,"" he said. ""The ideal outcome... right through to it not working at all and not getting a negotiated outcome at all."" Asked why Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson had said the government had ""no plan"" for such a scenario, he said: ""That's possibly because it's my responsibility to plan for it.""

"This video can not be played 'We were both flat out on the floor' A couple knocked themselves unconscious practising a lift from classic 1980s film Dirty Dancing for their wedding. Sharon Price and fiance Andy Price were trying to recreate its final dance scene in a pub garden in Weston-super-Mare in Somerset. Mr Price said: ""I was concussed. I was out. I ended up in a neck brace and had to have a CT scan. ""We were about 30ft apart and Sharon ran and I grabbed her hips and the next thing we knew we were flat out."" Mr Price said he had a mild heart attack several years ago and so the medical experts were ""just being careful"" with the tests they ran. They were discharged from hospital six hours later. The couple were about 30ft apart when Sharon started the run up towards her fiance for the Dirty Dancing lift ""Dirty Dancing"" began trending on Twitter as news of the couple's mishap spread around the world. The 1987 film, starring Patrick Swayze and Jennifer Grey, is one of Ms Price's favourite films. ""I've always watched it and me and my daughter watch it, over and over again,"" she said. ""We thought it would be something different. Everybody else slow dances, so we thought we'd jazz it up a bit."" Andy said the the next thing he knew they were ""flat out on the floor"" and he was unconscious On Saturday, on the ""spur of the moment"", the couple decided to ""get a bit of practice in"" and try out the famous Hollywood dance move. ""There was no build up, no warm up and that was it,"" said Mr Price. ""I think I knocked myself out hitting the floor as hard as I did. I wasn't too aware of what was going on after that."" Ms Price is also unsure: ""I can remember running towards Andy and then the next thing just struggling for breath and my back was hurting."" With him ""in and out of consciousness"" and her conscious but ""struggling for breath"" - an ambulance and rapid response vehicle were called and the couple were taken to Southmead Hospital. Sharon and Andy were hoping to recreate a scene from the 1987 film, shown here in a stage musical version The couple are now going to do a safer slow dance ""smooch"" when they marry next year The couple, who coincidentally have the same surnames, said they would rethink their first dance for the wedding. ""I don't think we'll have that one at the wedding, I think we'll go for a traditional slow one and I'll let Andy choose,"" said Ms Price. #DirtyDancing was one of the top hashtags in the UK on Twitter earlier. Worldwide there was a 92% increase in people using the hashtag earlier compared to the previous six hours, according to social media measurement tool Spredfast. Allow Twitter content?

"This video can not be played Jermain Defoe and superheroes followed Bradley Lowery's hearse Thousands of mourners have lined the streets of Bradley Lowery's home town for his funeral. The six-year-old Sunderland fan, from Blackhall Colliery, County Durham, died on Friday following a cancer fight. Footballer Jermain Defoe, who forged a strong bond with Bradley, joined his family in the cortege. The service, held at St Joseph's Church in the village, paid tribute to an ""incredible little boy with a huge personality"". The funeral cortege was led out by a bagpiper An emotional Jermain Defoe wore an England shirt bearing Bradley's name Ex Sunderland boss David Moyes was among the high-profile names from football in attendance Roads leading to the church were decked with balloons and tributes. Messages and mementos were also left outside Sunderland's Stadium of Light. Speakers broadcast the funeral service to the crowds outside the church who were unable to make it inside. Bradley's family wore football shirts in honour of his love of the sport. See more on this and other stories on our Local Live page. His mother, Gemma, told the congregation: ""He had a smile so big and beautiful it could brighten any room. A real brave superhero, he left us all too soon. ""He touched the hearts of many - the most inspirational boy. A loving, caring son and brother - a beautiful star. ""Although your time with us was short, you must have a job to do in heaven with the angels as God has chosen you. ""For now my baby we'll say goodbye. We'll meet again our superhero high up in the sky."" Tributes to the youngster lined the route of the cortege Almost every inch of the cortege route was lined with balloons Mourners wearing football tops decorated the route of the funeral cortege with balloons Shops along the cortege route were decked with balloons and tribute posters Hundreds of tributes were left outside Sunderland's Stadium of Light where Bradley was a mascot Almost all the mourners wore football shirts at the request of Bradley's family Father Ian Jackson told mourners: ""Today the football world stands united, whatever our colours, to pay their respects to this incredible little boy with a huge personality. ""As a big football fan, Bradley saw that sport teaches us the basic life lesson that one must get up after getting knocked down. It taught him to never ever quit."" A vigil and minute's applause were also held at Grey's Monument in Newcastle city centre to coincide with the funeral, while balloons were released at the Sunderland's ground. A single piper led the funeral procession and the applause down the street could be heard well before the horse and carriage carrying Bradley's coffin could be seen. It was preceded by a collection of superheroes - including Batman, Spider-Man and Captain America. Bradley's parents, Gemma and Carl, followed the hearse and behind them came footballer Jermain Defoe - who had flown back in from a pre-season training camp in Spain. There followed a number of players and staff from Bradley's beloved Sunderland.

"This video can not be played Toned-down Trump: What happened to the tough talk on Paris? French President Emmanuel Macron said he ""respected"" Donald Trump's decision to pull out of the Paris climate accord but that France would remain committed. ""On climate we know what our differences are,"" Mr Macron said in Paris on Thursday, adding that it was important to move forward. Speaking alongside Mr Macron, Mr Trump then hinted that the US could shift its position but failed to elaborate. ""Something could happen with respect to the Paris accord,"" he said. Mr Trump added: ""We'll see what happens."" The US president said last month that the US would withdraw from the2015 Paris climate agreement, citing moves to negotiate a new ""fair"" deal that would not disadvantage US businesses. Has Trump changed his mind about Paris? Watch: Trump's awkward handshakes Trump: Mood in the White House is 'fantastic' Unanswered questions for Trump Jr Mr Macron said it was right to put the climate issue to one side while the two leaders discussed how they could work together on other matters such as the ceasefire in Syria and trade partnerships. ""We have disagreements; Mr Trump had election pledges that he took to his supporters and I had pledges - should this hinder progress on all issues? No,"" Mr Macron said. Mr Macron and Mr Trump then talked about their countries' joint efforts to combat terrorism and in particular the so-called Islamic State group in Syria and Iraq. ""The US is extremely involved in the Iraq war,"" Mr Macron said, ""I would like to thank the president for everything done by American troops in this area"". ""We've agreed to continue our joint work,"" he added, ""in particular building the post-war roadmap"". Mr Macron said that France would seek to ""undertake several robust initiatives"" to help produce greater stability and ""control over the region"". This video can not be played The US president told Brigitte Macron she was ""in good shape"" Mr Trump, who is in Paris for a two-day visit, was earlier welcomed by Mr Macron with an official military ceremony. The US president then visited the tomb of Napoleon before Friday's Bastille Day celebrations. The trip is aimed at reaffirming historic ties but comes amid tension due to the two leaders' different positions over climate change. Air Force One touched down at Orly airport in Paris earlier on Thursday; Mr Trump and the First Lady emerging from their flight across the Atlantic in an effort to help strengthen US-France relations. ""Emmanuel, nice to see you. This is so beautiful,"" Mr Trump said as he was met by Mr Macron at the Hotel des Invalides, near the site of Napoleon's tomb. Despite their clear differences, Paris has emphasised that Mr Macron will work to reaffirm historic ties between the two allies to prevent the US from being isolated. The two presidents reviewed the troops during the ceremony at Les Invalides The two-day visit is seen as an opportunity to reaffirm US-France relations Following the ceremony at Les Invalides the leaders moved on to the ÃlysÃ©e Palace. Mr Trump will also dine with Mr Macron at the Eiffel Tower and watch the Bastille Day parade on the Champs-ÃlysÃ©es. This year marks the 100th anniversary of US forces entering World War One, and for this occasion US and French troops will be marching together in the parade. Speaking to the BBC, the former US diplomat and state department official, William Jordan, said the visit was likely to be viewed by Mr Trump as an opportunity for the US president to be ""taken seriously in the world"". ""I think that there's a lot of symbolism in this,"" he said, adding: ""I doubt that there's going to be very much more beyond substantive discussion."" The presidents and their partners visited Napoleon Bonaparte's tomb Demonstrations are expected. French protesters have planned a ""No Trump Zone"" at the Place de la Republique. The Facebook page for the event states: ""Trump is not welcome in Paris"". Mr Trump's visit comes amid fresh allegations of Russian interference in the 2016 US presidential election, with his eldest son admitting he held a ""nonsense"" meeting that had promised Russian government information about his father's democratic rival Hillary Clinton. Mr Trump has since described the mood in the White House as ""fantastic"" and told Reuters that the administration was ""functioning beautifully"". Trump in France: Will Macron make ties great again?

"The Times considers attempts by French President Emmanuel Macron to shape what it calls a special but critical relationship with the US The government's repeal bill, which will convert EU legislation into British law, is dismissed by the Guardian as a""bodge-job"",external. The paper expresses concern about the use of what are known as Henry VIII powers, which it believes will lead to ministers wielding a formidable weapon of executive control without accountability. The Times shares such concerns, saying ministerial powers aretoo broad,external. The details of Brexit are too important to be left to ministers and civil servants, argues the paper. Instead, they should be hammered out in Parliament. TheFinancial Times,externaldescribes the government's repeal bill as a largely technical measure that will ensure legal continuity after Brexit. But it warns that it will become a legislative quagmire when MPs start debating it in the autumn. The Daily Mirror also takes up the theme,predicting months of parliamentary warfare,external. TheDaily Mail,externalwonders why the bill has created hysteria, describing the government's approach as common sense. The paper say it is a straightforward and eminently workable bill. TheDaily Express,externaldescribes it as entirely necessary and a vital part of the Brexit process, whilethe Sun,externalsays the legislation is harmless. The Times,externalconsiders attempts by French President Emmanuel Macron to shape what it calls a special but critical relationship with the US. It talks of him as trying to portray himself as America's best friend in Europe. With Theresa May embroiled in Brexit negotiations, the Times says Mr Macron has moved to fill the void with fulsome expressions of support for the US and its president. TheDaily Telegraph,externalsuggests that by bringing Mr Trump to Paris, Mr Macron has clearly stolen a march on the embattled Mrs May. Liu Xiaobo died from liver cancer There are many reflections on the life of the Chinese dissident and Nobel Peace Prize winner, Liu Xiaobo, who died on Thursday from liver cancer at a heavily-guarded hospital. For the Guardian, the fact that he was still held over his peaceful call for democratic reform, almost nine years ago, isChina's shame and a stain on the world's conscience,external. The Telegraph says that although he became a hero to Chinese dissidents, the country's strict censorship of the media meant most people there had probably never heard of him. The Times sees Mr Lui's death as a reminder that China hasa long distance to travel before it can class itself as a free moral nation,external. The skeleton of Hope the blue whale went on show in the entrance hall of the Natural History Museum, in London, on Thursday. Forthe Mail,external, it is the attraction's most jaw-dropping exhibit, while the chief art critic ofthe Times gives it five stars,external. Rachel Campbell-Johnston describes how the skeleton seems almost to swoop down upon you. She concludes: ""How can you help but be awestruck?"" The skeleton of the blue whale Hope appears at the Natural History Museum The sports pages are dominated by Briton Johanna Konta's defeat in the Wimbledon semi-final. TheTelegraph,externalsays her hopes were crushed by a ruthless performance by the five-times champion, Venus Williams. The i,externaltalks of Konta being overwhelmed by the power and grace of the ageless US player, whilethe Mail,externalsays she was blown away by a pace attack.

"Jagdip Randhawa's family appealed the results of an internal investigation into how the case was handled Bail breaches by a man who killed a student were handled in a ""fundamentally flawed"" manner, a report has found. Jagdip Randhawa, 19, from London, was punched by boxer Clifton Ty Mitchell during a night out in Leeds in 2011. Mitchell, from Derby, had breached bail conditions for a previous violent offence 24 times in the preceding five months but no action was taken. Derbyshire Police said procedures had been reviewed and made more ""robust"". A separate investigation found Mr Randhawa's care in hospital was also below acceptable standards After being hit, Mr Randhawa, from Hounslow, struck his head on a pavement. He died five days later. Mitchell, now 26, was convicted of manslaughter and sentenced to seven years in prison in 2012. An initial referral to the Independent Police Complaints Commission following a complaint by Mr Randhawa's family led to the force carrying out a local investigation. In March 2015 the IPCC upheld an appeal by the family against the outcome of this inquiry and began its own. The new report states: ""In my opinion, the procedure in place at the time of the incident was fundamentally flawed and was not fit for the control of persons deemed by the court system to require active monitoring. ""This process was in my opinion so flawed that none of the staff operating under it appeared to recognise the ongoing issues with this one individual and see the obvious opportunities missed."" The report also criticised the handling of complaints from the family, with a unnamed superintendent potentially facing misconduct charges if the officer had not retired. Mr Randhawa's sister Majinder Randhawa said: ""Our family will always be haunted by not knowing what might have happened if Mitchell had been arrested as he should have been. ""It's important that the IPCC's report highlights the significant failings of Derbyshire Police - but it's devastating to know that Jagdip's death was avoidable. ""We believe that Jagdip would still be here today, if Derbyshire Police had correctly managed Mitchell while he was on bail. It's impossible for us to ever get over that."" Derbyshire's Deputy Chief Constable, Gary Knighton, said ""The IPCC report recognises that following the death of Mr Randhawa, we immediately reviewed the way that the force handled breaches of bail conditions where an individual is required to report to a police station. ""The force now has a more robust system in place to deal with a suspect who has failed to comply with their bail conditions. If someone breaches their bail, an officer is allocated to take action and deal with the breach.""

"Jason Major, a JunoCam citizen scientist and a graphic designer from Warwick, Rhode Island, took the raw images from the probe to create this perspective An American space agency probe has returned the most detailed pictures ever of Jupiter's Great Red Spot. The Juno spacecraft passed over the giant storm on Monday as it continued with its series of close passes of the gaseous world. The pictures of the spot reveal the intricate nature of its swirls which encompass a region bigger than Earth. Juno's instruments all acquired data during the pass which should now provide fresh insight on the storm. Juno peers below Jupiter's clouds Jupiter's red spot 'roars with heat' Nasa probe arrives in Jupiter orbit The raw images that come down from Juno are a lot more washed out. Citizen scientists like to accentuate the colours and contrast to highlight features that might otherwise be overlooked It has been a particularly long-lived feature on Jupiter, but there is evidence that the 16,350-km-wide oval has actually been shrinking of late. The Great Red Spot has persisted for centuries. Scientists are keen to learn its secrets and Juno provides the key ""For hundreds of years scientists have been observing, wondering and theorising about Jupiter's Great Red Spot,""  Scott Bolton, Juno principal investigator from the Southwest Research Institute in San Antonio, said in a Nasa statement. ""Now we have the best pictures ever of this iconic storm. It will take us some time to analyse all the data from not only JunoCam, but Junoâs eight science instruments, to shed some new light on the past, present and future of the Great Red Spot."" Scientists describe the storm as something similar to a hurricane - but there are significant differences between that kind of storm on Earth and what we see at Jupiter. Many behaviours are not the same. For example, hurricanes on Earth quickly lose energy when they leave the ocean surface and pass over land - but on Jupiter, there is no land. Indeed, researchers are not even sure there exists any kind of hard surface under the planet's clouds. This could be an explanation for why the spot has persisted for centuries. But Juno hopes to resolve such puzzles. It has the instrumentation to determine the precise chemical composition of the oval's clouds, to sense their temperature and structure, and to measure how deep they go. There is a suspicion that the spot has very deep roots. The mission should reveal the spot's internal structure and how deep its roots go Jonathan Nichols, a British science team-member from the University of Leicester, marvelled at the new pictures. ""These images are stunning, and reveal Jupiter's Great Red Spot in all its glory,"" he told BBC News. ""From the three swirls inside the deep red core to the waves and vortices orbiting it, the images reveal the power and chaos of this iconic storm. ""The light and dark shades reveal the wind flow in the spot and potentially the 3D structure of the cloud decks.  But the images are also a perfect convergence of science and art, revealing the awesome beauty of the giant planet. ""The quality of these data are superb, and it bodes well for further Juno data that will reveal how deep into the atmosphere the Great Red Spot extends."" Juno has been at Jupiter for just over a year. It flies large ellipses around the planet, coming in close every 53 days. Mondayâs pass saw it skim just 3,500km above the cloudtops at one point. When it travelled across the spot, it was still a mere 9,000km overhead. The practice of the mission so far has been to release raw images from JunoCam and invite the public to work on them - to process them in ways that highlight areas of scientific interest, or simply to make some fascinating artwork. Meanwhile, the science team gets to work on the data-sets from the other instruments. Their findings take a while longer to emerge - at conferences and in journal papers. Jupiter is 11 times wider than Earth and 300 times more massive It takes 12 Earth years to orbit the Sun; a 'day' is 10 hours long In composition it resembles a star; it's mostly hydrogen and helium Under pressure, the hydrogen assumes a state similar to a metal This 'metallic hydrogen' could be the source of the magnetic field Most of the visible cloudtops contain ammonia and hydrogen sulphide Jupiter's low-latitude 'bands' play host to very strong east-west winds The Great Red Spot is a giant storm vortex wider than Planet Earth Jonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk,externaland follow me on Twitter:@BBCAmos,external At least two killed and 1,000 structures destroyed as wildfires rage in Los Angeles Watch: Ferocious and explosive fire burns behind CBS reporter Liam Payne cause of death confirmed as UK inquest opens Where is Greenland and why does Trump want it?

"Charlie has a rare genetic condition and is on life support An American doctor offering to treat terminally ill Charlie Gard has told the High Court there is a 10% chance he could improve the baby's condition. The 11-month-old has a rare genetic disorder and severe brain damage which doctors at Great Ormond Street Hospital (GOSH) had said was irreversible. In April, the High Court ruled that life support should be removed to enable Charlie to die with dignity. The doctor has agreed to assess Charlie in the UK if the court adjourns. Mr Justice Francis is due to rule on whether Charlie, who is on life support at GOSH, can be given a trial treatment. The US doctor - who cannot be named for legal reasons - has been giving evidence to the High Court via video link. The judge said he wanted to hear what the doctor thought had changed since he gave his ruling in April. This video can not be played The six-year-old US boy who outlived medical expectations The doctor suggested there was now clinical data not available in April and he thought the therapy was ""worth trying"". Although he has not yet seen Charlie in person, he told the judge tests on the boy's brain show ""disorganisation of brain activity and not major structural brain damage"". Usingnucleoside treatment- which is a therapy and not a cure - he estimated there would be a 10% chance of ""meaningful success"" for Charlie. He said early tests on mice with TK2, a slightly different condition to Charlie's, had resulted in some improvements. He acknowledged that while it would be desirable to conduct further testing on rodents, that could take a minimum of six months to two years. The small number of people with Charlie's rare genetic condition - mitochondrial DNA depletion syndrome - would make robust clinical trials difficult, he added. This video can not be played Alasdair Seton-Marsden read a statement from Charlie's parents that said 'he is still fighting' Doctors at GOSH - where Charlie is being cared for - say he should be moved on to palliative care but his parents have raised more than Â£1.3m to take their son to the US for the nucleoside therapy. The High Court has also been hearing arguments about the child's head size, which UK doctors said indicated of lack of brain function. Mr Francis said it was ""absurd"" that a dispute over his head size was ""undermining"" the case. Doctors said the baby's skull had not grown in three months. The lawyer for Charlie's parents, Connie Yates and Chris Gard, told the court Ms Yates had regularly measured her son's head and disagreed with the hospital's measurements. Charlie Gard case explained The court heard Ms Yates had measured her baby's head this morning and there was a 2cm difference with the hospital's measurements. Mr Justice Francis said he wanted the matter resolved and called for an independent person to measure Charlie's head within 24 hours. ""It is absurd that the science of this case is being infected by the inability to measure a child's skull,"" he said. Connie Yates and Chris Gard walked out of the hearing at the High Court Charlie's parents, from Bedfont, west London, left the courtroom after two hours over a disagreement with the judge about what they had said at a previous hearing on whether their child was in pain. Mr Gard stood up and said: ""I thought this was supposed to be independent."" Mr Justice Francis then offered to adjourn but was told the pair already knew the evidence being given by their legal team. Ms Yates and Mr Gard returned for the afternoon session. Supporters of Charlie's parents have been outside the court Connie Yates and Chris Gard have raised more than Â£1.3m to fund a treatment trial The case returned to the High Court following reports of new data from foreign healthcare experts who suggested treatment could improve Charlie's condition. Doctors at GOSH have said the evidence is not new but it was right for the court to explore it. Grant Armstrong, who is leading Ms Yates and Mr Gard's legal team, told the judge they wanted to reopen the case on the basis that the treatment is likely to affect Charlie's brain cells. He said the parents disputed the view that Charlie has ""irreversible, irreparable"" brain damage. The couple have already lost battles in the High Court, Court of Appeal and Supreme Court to allow them to take their son elsewhere for treatment. They also failed to persuade European Court of Human Rights judges to intervene in the case. 3 March 2017: Mr Justice Francis starts to analyse the case at a hearing in the family division of the High Court in London 11 April: He says doctors can stop providing life-support treatment 3 May: Charlie's parents ask Court of Appeal judges to consider the case 23 May: Three Court of Appeal judges analyse the case 25 May: The Court of Appeal judges dismiss the couple's appeal 8 June: Charlie's parents lose their fight in the Supreme Court 20 June: Judges in the European Court of Human Rights start to analyse the case, after lawyers representing Charlie's parents make written submissions 27 June: Judges in the European Court of Human Rights refuse to intervene 3 July: The Pope and US President Donald Trump offer to intervene 7 July: Great Ormond Street Hospital applies for a fresh hearing at the High Court The story of Charlie Gard Charlie Gard 'evidence not new' Charlie Gard's parents make hospital plea Fresh court bid in Charlie Gard case 'Impossible' to transfer Charlie Gard Pope and Trump offer Charlie Gard support HM Courts Service Great Ormond Street Hospital Walworth Town Hall shows off majestic transformation as it reopens 11 years after horrific fire Lloydâs of London chief executive John Neal to leave for Aon Sadiq Khan's deputy could overturn refusal of 46-storey student tower The World Club returns with the Revive-all repair workshop in Kingston for 2025 Ramraiders steal designer sunglasses worth Â£10k from Hampstead optician The Traitors: How you can get Claudia Winkleman's iconic look on a budget At least two killed and 1,000 structures destroyed as wildfires rage in Los Angeles Watch: Ferocious and explosive fire burns behind CBS reporter Liam Payne cause of death confirmed as UK inquest opens Where is Greenland and why does Trump want it?

"Rhodri Colwyn Philipps called Gina Miller a 'troublesome first generation immigrant' An aristocrat who wrote an online post offering Â£5,000 to anyone who ran over businesswoman Gina Miller has been sentenced to 12 weeks in prison. Rhodri Colwyn Philipps - the 4th Viscount St Davids - posted on Facebook four days after Ms Miller won a Brexit legal challenge against the government. Philipps, 50, of Knightsbridge, central London, was found guilty of two charges of making menacing communications. The other count related to his response to a news article about an immigrant. At his Westminster Magistrates' Court trial Philipps claimed the post about Ms Miller was a ""joke"" and a ""conversation piece for his Facebook friends"". He called his comments ""satire"". Senior district judge Emma Arbuthnot said she had ""no doubt it was menacing"". She told the peer the post effectively put a ""bounty"" on Ms Miller's head and had left the businesswoman ""shocked"" and feeling ""violated."" Philipps had written: ""Â£5,000 for the first person to 'accidentally' run over this bloody troublesome first generation immigrant."" Describing Ms Miller as a ""boat jumper"", he added: ""If this is what we should expect from immigrants, send them back to their stinking jungles."" Businesswoman Gina Miller campaigned for Parliament to have a say over Brexit Giving evidence to the trial, Ms Miller - who was born in Guyana - said she had been the subject of death threats since her role in November's legal challenge which ruled the government had to consult Parliament before formally beginning the Brexit process. Viscount's post left Gina Miller 'violated' The other post Philipps was convicted over was about an immigrant and his family in Luton who were involved in a row over housing. Before sentencing, defence lawyer Sabrina Felix told the court Philipps understood how his actions had ""impacted"" on the subjects of his posts, and ""he only hopes, wishes and prays that they do accept his sincere apology"". Ms Felix added ""he accepts that the comments were wholly disgraceful"" and ""menacing in character"". But the judge said Philipps was ""so clearly showing hostility to Ms Miller based on her race or ethnic origin that I find it ludicrous that he should say otherwise"". Ms Arbuthnot said the the peer had a hatred of anyone who had different views to his and ""anyone who has recently arrived in the country"". She added: ""You show this hatred by publicly directing abusive threats at others which is a criminal offence in this multi-racial society we are lucky enough to live in.""

"This video can not be played Stephen Hough guilty of Janet Commins Flint manslaughter A man has been convicted of raping and killing a 15-year-old girl in 1976. Janet Commins' body was found on a school field in Flint, north Wales, by three children playing hide and seek. Stephen Hough, 58, from Flint, was convicted of manslaughter, rape and sexual assault at Mold Crown Court on Thursday. He was cleared of murder. Janetwent missing after leaving her home to go swimmingon 7 January 1976 and another man has already served six years for her manslaughter. Noel Jones, who was aged 18 at the time, admitted killing Janet and served half of 12-year prison sentence. However, he told the trial he was made a scapegoat by policebecause he was a Gypsy who could barely read or write. Speaking after the case, Janet's uncle Derek Ierston said it was ""galling"" to think the man responsible for her death had been ""living in our community for all these years"". Janet Commins: How police caught her killer after 41 years Stephen Hough (right) was convicted 41 years after he sexually assaulted and killed Janet Commins Janet Commins left her house to go swimming with a friend and her parents Eileen and Ted never saw her alive again Janet made plans to go swimming on 7 January, but her mother said she did not look well so could not go. She left her house without her parents knowing and left them a note saying she would be back by 20:30. She left the pool just after 19:30 and told a friend she was heading straight home - but she was spotted with two boys at about 20:10. A boy who reported seeing them said one of the boys with her was thin and fair-haired, while the other was an older-looking, about 17, and they were laughing and joking with Janet. Edward Commins reported his daughter missing at about 23:00 that night and her body was found four days later. Mr Hough was questioned at the time as his grandparents' house overlooked the area where Janet's body was concealed. He said he was stealing petrol from a vehicle in Flint that night and was subsequently fined for the offence. In 2006, a review of the scientific evidence in the case was carried out and DNA from a man was identified from samples taken from Janet's body. In 2016, Mr Hough's DNA was taken by police in an unrelated matter and a match was found, prompting his arrest. DNA matching Hough's was found on samples stored from the crime scene at the time and the jury heard it wasa billion times more likely to belong to Houghthan anyone else. The court heard Janet was killed during a sexual assault and there were signs her body had been left lying face down ""for some time"" before being moved to where it was found. Prosecutor Mark Heywood QC said Janet died ""as a result of her neck and her external airway being compressed and blocked during that sexual assault"". Hough, who was 16 years old when he raped and killed Janet, will be sentenced at a later date. Janet's uncle, Derek Ierston, read a statement on behalf of the family after the court case Janet's father Ted died many years ago after suffering with a long illness - her mother Eileen was hit with what the family described as ""a bombshell"" when she found out about the new suspect. In a family statement read outside the court, Mr Ierston said: ""It's so galling to think that the person who so maliciously and violently took Janet's life has been living in our community for all these years. ""The difficulty for the family is that he has had a life, been married and had children. But he stole Janet's future and took away the opportunity for Eileen, Ted and the rest of the family to see Janet grow up, get married and have her own children. ""Today's verdict cannot bring Janet back to us, but hopefully the weeks and months to come will provide us with some closure."" The Independent Police Complaints Commissionis investigating how North Wales Police handledthe original investigation.

"Erica Osbourne suffered second degree burns and scars in the incident at Disneyland Paris A woman who was burned when her clothes caught fire in a Disneyland Paris restaurant says she was told it was ""no different to falling off a bike"". Erica Osbourne, 37, claims it happened when a chef used a blow torch on a dessert. She lost part of her hair and eyebrows in the incident in February. She said ""a massive fireball came across the counter towards me"" as the crÃ¨me brÃ»lÃ©e sugar was lit. Disneyland Paris said guest safety ""is our number one priority"". Mrs Osbourne, from Bristol, said she suffered second degree burns when her jumper caught fire as a chef used the torch on the dessert. She said the flames narrowly missed her 10-year-old daughter, Abigail, at the Newport Bay Hotel Restaurant. ""I had ordered the crÃ¨me brÃ»lÃ©e and Abigail had gone to get an ice cream when the chef lit the sugar and a massive fireball came across the counter towards me. ""I was so terrified that I froze to the spot but I remember an intense heat on my face. ""Abigail told me later that I was screaming 'help me! I'm on fire'. My jumper and my face were on fire."" She said a chef jumped over the counter and he and another customer ""bundled me to the ground and rolled me around to put out the flames"". ""Immediately after I was burnt one of the managers said to me that the incident was 'no different to falling off a bike'.  I couldn't believe it."" she added. Mrs Osbourne was treated by paramedics and spent several hours in hospital. She is now taking legal action against Disneyland Paris for personal injury.

"This video can not be played Theresa May was talking to BBC Radio 5 Live Theresa May has revealed she shed a ""little tear"" when she learned the result of the election exit poll suggesting she would lose her majority. The prime minister said her husband Philip told her the news - and it came as a ""complete shock"". ""It took a few minutes for it to sink in,"" she told BBC Radio 5 Live's Emma Barnett, because ""we didn't see that result coming"". ""My husband gave me a hug,"" she added, and she cried a ""little tear"". The prime minister said she did not watch the exit poll herself, as ""I have a little bit of superstition about things like that"". This video can not be played This is the moment Mrs May missed... She knew her campaign had not been ""perfect"", she added, but all the indications she had had were that she would increase her Commons majority. Mrs May called 8 June's general election to tighten her grip on power and strengthen her hand in Brexit talks by increasing the number of Conservative MPs in the Commons. But although she started more than 20 points ahead of Labour in the opinion polls she lost most of that lead as well as 22 seats, wiping out the 17 seat majority she had inherited from predecessor David Cameron. The ITV/Sky/BBC exit poll, which was carried out at polling stations across the UK, was met with surprise and scepticism by MPs from all parties when it was announced as voting ended - the widespread assumption had still been that the Conservatives would at least keep their majority. Government publishing Brexit repeal bill Profile: The Theresa May Story Election 2017: Key points at-a-glance But as the night unfolded its prediction that the Conservatives would be the largest party, but without an overall majority, turned out to be accurate. Talking for the first time about her reaction to the result, she said it took a ""few minutes"" for it to sink in but she then got on the phone to Conservative campaign headquarters to ""find out what had happened"". She said it was ""devastating"" to watch people she had worked with for years lose their seats but added: ""I didn't consider stepping down because I felt there was a responsibility to ensure that the country still had a government."" This video can not be played Theresa May full interview Asked about the criticism she faced for failing to acknowledge her lost majority in a speech in Downing Street the following day, Mrs May said: ""At that point in time I felt what was important was giving people the confidence of  knowing there was going to be a government."" She said she did not regret calling the election because ""I think it was the right thing to do at the time"". In her bid to promote strength and stability during the election, Theresa May was often accused of being repetitive and robotic. Today she showed a more human side. Mrs May's candid interview may come too late for those who weren't persuaded by her personality during the election, but no doubt her team will hope it helps garner public support for her still precarious premiership. But she wished she had put across a more positive message during the campaign and, in particular, addressed the concerns of young people, who are believed to have voted in large numbers for Labour. The ""clear message"" that came through from young people was that they feared they could not get on the ""property ladder"", she told Emma Barnett. ""Looking back on the campaign, I realise now and regret that we were not making more of that,"" she said. She insisted her government had the ""humility"" to ""listen to the message we got from people at the election"". One of those messages, she said, was that people wanted to see a ""greater consensus"" in Parliament, which was why she had appealed for support from Labour on Brexit and other policies. On Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn - who was the target of Conservative attacks on his character and judgement during the campaign - she praised the way he had reacted to the terror attack at Finsbury Park in his constituency. ""I saw a Jeremy Corbyn there who was a good constituency MP, working with those people,"" she said.

"The woman was knocked over by the blast of a plane taking off: this file photo shows a plane arriving at Sint Maarten A New Zealand woman has died on the Caribbean territory of Sint Maarten after the blast from a powerful jet engine knocked her to the ground. The incident happened at the famous Princess Juliana International Airport, which is just metres from the beach. Beachgoers can walk up to the airport fence as planes take off. Police said the 57-year-old woman had been holding on to the fence before the force of the jet engines threw her backwards, causing serious injury. She was taken to hospital for treatment, but died later. The particular stretch of beach on the Dutch territory is popular with tourists, partly because the planes fly extremely low over the sand before landing. The beginning of the runway is just 50m (160ft) from the fence on Maho beach, and about the same distance to the waterline. What is a jet engine air blast like? There are prominent warning signs in the area instructing beachgoers not to stand near the fence because of the dangerous air blasts. Despite the danger, a number of videos circulating online show tourists clinging to the fence to prevent being swept away - and in some cases, almost being lifted off the ground. The island's tourism director, Rolando Brison,told the New Zealand Herald,externalhe had spoken to the family of the dead woman. ""I met with the family of the deceased this evening and while they recognised that what they did was wrong, through the clearly visible danger signs, they regret that risk they took turned out in the worst possible way,"" he said. The newspaper also said the plane taking off was a Boeing 737, a commercial jet. A number of local media reports said the woman struck her head on concrete when she was blown back from the fence line. In a statement, Sint Maarten police said they visit the area daily to discourage tourists from clinging to the runway fence. ""The landing and taking off of all types and size of aircraft at the international airport of Sint Maarten is well known worldwide as major tourist attraction,"" police said. ""Many tourists come to the island to experience the thrills of the landing of approaching aircraft flying low above their heads and the holding on to the airport fence and standing in the jet blast of large aircraft taking off. Doing this is, however, extremely dangerous.""

Phones were banned as the first episode of the penultimate series was screened at the Walt Disney Concert Hall.

""It feels like a death in the family [but] it's also exciting, and liberating,"" said the British star. (Scroll down to see newly-released photographs from the seventh season) Sophie Turner said the rest of the cast felt ""like family"" after seven series Gwendoline Christie, who plays the warrior Brienne of Tarth, gave off ice queen vibes on the blue carpet Emilia Clarke - who was absent from the premiere, due to filming commitments on the forthcoming Han Solo film - has also talked about the stress of concluding the series. ""I get sleepless nights over it,"" she recently told Elle Magazine. ""The higher everyone places the mantle, the bigger the fall. I don't want to disappoint anyone."" Listen: Game of Thrones' Sam Tarly answers 'Maestermind' questions Among the other stars walking the blue carpet on Wednesday night were Alfie Allen, Conleth Hill, Liam Cunningham, Gwendoline Christie and Maisie Williams.

The cast, who are already used to hardships on set, said they had had to endure bitterly cold conditions for this series. ""Belfast is never not cold,"" Isaac Hempstead Wright, who plays Bran Stark,told The Hollywood Reporter,external. ""That's the first thing I learned when I arrived, my first day on set - my first day ever on a film set.

"Charlie has a rare genetic condition and is on life support An American doctor offering to treat terminally ill Charlie Gard has told the High Court there is a 10% chance he could improve the baby's condition. The 11-month-old has a rare genetic disorder and severe brain damage which doctors at Great Ormond Street Hospital (GOSH) had said was irreversible. In April, the High Court ruled that life support should be removed to enable Charlie to die with dignity. The doctor has agreed to assess Charlie in the UK if the court adjourns. Mr Justice Francis is due to rule on whether Charlie, who is on life support at GOSH, can be given a trial treatment. The US doctor - who cannot be named for legal reasons - has been giving evidence to the High Court via video link. The judge said he wanted to hear what the doctor thought had changed since he gave his ruling in April. This video can not be played The six-year-old US boy who outlived medical expectations The doctor suggested there was now clinical data not available in April and he thought the therapy was ""worth trying"". Although he has not yet seen Charlie in person, he told the judge tests on the boy's brain show ""disorganisation of brain activity and not major structural brain damage"". Usingnucleoside treatment- which is a therapy and not a cure - he estimated there would be a 10% chance of ""meaningful success"" for Charlie. He said early tests on mice with TK2, a slightly different condition to Charlie's, had resulted in some improvements. He acknowledged that while it would be desirable to conduct further testing on rodents, that could take a minimum of six months to two years. The small number of people with Charlie's rare genetic condition - mitochondrial DNA depletion syndrome - would make robust clinical trials difficult, he added. This video can not be played Alasdair Seton-Marsden read a statement from Charlie's parents that said 'he is still fighting' Doctors at GOSH - where Charlie is being cared for - say he should be moved on to palliative care but his parents have raised more than Â£1.3m to take their son to the US for the nucleoside therapy. The High Court has also been hearing arguments about the child's head size, which UK doctors said indicated of lack of brain function. Mr Francis said it was ""absurd"" that a dispute over his head size was ""undermining"" the case. Doctors said the baby's skull had not grown in three months. The lawyer for Charlie's parents, Connie Yates and Chris Gard, told the court Ms Yates had regularly measured her son's head and disagreed with the hospital's measurements. Charlie Gard case explained The court heard Ms Yates had measured her baby's head this morning and there was a 2cm difference with the hospital's measurements. Mr Justice Francis said he wanted the matter resolved and called for an independent person to measure Charlie's head within 24 hours. ""It is absurd that the science of this case is being infected by the inability to measure a child's skull,"" he said. Connie Yates and Chris Gard walked out of the hearing at the High Court Charlie's parents, from Bedfont, west London, left the courtroom after two hours over a disagreement with the judge about what they had said at a previous hearing on whether their child was in pain. Mr Gard stood up and said: ""I thought this was supposed to be independent."" Mr Justice Francis then offered to adjourn but was told the pair already knew the evidence being given by their legal team. Ms Yates and Mr Gard returned for the afternoon session. Supporters of Charlie's parents have been outside the court Connie Yates and Chris Gard have raised more than Â£1.3m to fund a treatment trial The case returned to the High Court following reports of new data from foreign healthcare experts who suggested treatment could improve Charlie's condition. Doctors at GOSH have said the evidence is not new but it was right for the court to explore it. Grant Armstrong, who is leading Ms Yates and Mr Gard's legal team, told the judge they wanted to reopen the case on the basis that the treatment is likely to affect Charlie's brain cells. He said the parents disputed the view that Charlie has ""irreversible, irreparable"" brain damage. The couple have already lost battles in the High Court, Court of Appeal and Supreme Court to allow them to take their son elsewhere for treatment. They also failed to persuade European Court of Human Rights judges to intervene in the case. 3 March 2017: Mr Justice Francis starts to analyse the case at a hearing in the family division of the High Court in London 11 April: He says doctors can stop providing life-support treatment 3 May: Charlie's parents ask Court of Appeal judges to consider the case 23 May: Three Court of Appeal judges analyse the case 25 May: The Court of Appeal judges dismiss the couple's appeal 8 June: Charlie's parents lose their fight in the Supreme Court 20 June: Judges in the European Court of Human Rights start to analyse the case, after lawyers representing Charlie's parents make written submissions 27 June: Judges in the European Court of Human Rights refuse to intervene 3 July: The Pope and US President Donald Trump offer to intervene 7 July: Great Ormond Street Hospital applies for a fresh hearing at the High Court The story of Charlie Gard Charlie Gard 'evidence not new' Charlie Gard's parents make hospital plea Fresh court bid in Charlie Gard case 'Impossible' to transfer Charlie Gard Pope and Trump offer Charlie Gard support HM Courts Service Great Ormond Street Hospital Walworth Town Hall shows off majestic transformation as it reopens 11 years after horrific fire Lloydâs of London chief executive John Neal to leave for Aon Sadiq Khan's deputy could overturn refusal of 46-storey student tower The World Club returns with the Revive-all repair workshop in Kingston for 2025 Ramraiders steal designer sunglasses worth Â£10k from Hampstead optician The Traitors: How you can get Claudia Winkleman's iconic look on a budget At least two killed and 1,000 structures destroyed as wildfires rage in Los Angeles Watch: Ferocious and explosive fire burns behind CBS reporter Liam Payne cause of death confirmed as UK inquest opens Where is Greenland and why does Trump want it?

"Christina Grant moved in with family in Australia after the death of a son in Scotland A 96-year-old woman is preparing to return to Scotland from Australia after a visa wrangle. Christina Grant's family, who live in New South Wales, flew her to Australia following the death of her son and carer, Robert, in February 2015. Her family believed they had met the requirements of her visa, which has expired. Immigration officials said they had been working with the family and made no arrangements to remove Mrs Grant. However, the grandmother's family told BBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland programme that they had not found Australia's immigration department helpful and had gone to specialists for assistance. They could apply for a new visa but were told that this could take 30 years to resolve. The Grant family had hoped that because of her age and state of her heath that her situation might be treated a special case. Mrs Grant's surviving son Allan and his wife Diane believe they have done everything to meet the rules of her visa after she moved to live with them in Australia. Mrs Grant is booked on a flight back to the UK on 26 July. Her family told BBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland programme that the alternatives were the possibility of deportation or ""years of limbo"" while trying to obtain a new visa. Mrs Grant, who is partially sighted and has dementia, was living near Grantown on Spey in the Highlands. Her son Robert had been helping to look after her. Because of the state of her health, Allan and Diane asked her to move to Australia and live with them. They applied for a visa for her to come to Australia. A condition of her visa was that she had to depart Australia once every 12 months but could return. Concerned that Mrs Grant was not fit enough to fly out of Australia to meet this requirement, her family booked her on a cruise into an area of French territory in the Pacific Ocean. They believed that this trip would meet the visa requirements. However, after the cruise the Grants were told by the Department of Immigration and Border Protection that the visa rules had not been met. Diane told Good Morning Scotland that immigration specialists had told the family that applying for a new visa could take up to 30 years to come through. They are now preparing to fly with Mrs Grant back to Scotland. Diane said: ""We will have to help her find a home over there. ""We have our own life here in Australia and, while I don't want to live there, Mum wants to live here."" The Grants have highlighted their case in an effort to alert other families that may find themselves in the same situation. The Department of Immigration and Border Protection said all visitors to Australia must hold a valid visa for the duration of their stay and comply with the conditions of that visa. A spokesperson said: ""The department is familiar with Ms Grant's case and is not making any arrangements to remove her from Australia. ""The tourist stream visitor visa is normally valid for stays of up to 12 months and, as with all visitor visas, is designed to facilitate temporary visits to Australia rather than long-term stays or residence. ""Conscious of her circumstances, the department has been working with Ms Grant to resolve her visa status, since her visitor visa expired. ""Ms Grant has no current visa applications with the department."" PICTURES: Were you at Best Bar None Awards? Temperatures to plummet to -15C in north and north-east: How cold is your area?

"Madalyn Parker, a US web developer, sparked a debate about workplace attitudes to mind problems aftertweeting,externalan email from her boss. Her boss said she was an ""example to us all"" by telling colleagues she was taking sick leave for her mental health - but would British managers be similarly supportive? In an email titled ""Where's Madalyn"", she told colleagues: ""I'm taking today and tomorrow to focus on my mental health. Hopefully I'll be back next week refreshed and back to 100%"". Chief executive Ben Congleton replied to the message, saying: ""I can't believe this is not standard practice at all organisations,"" adding: ""You are an example to us all, and help cut through the stigma so we can all bring our whole selves to work."" In the UK, there is no legal difference between taking a mental health sick day and a day off for a physical problem like a back problem. Last year, Britons took 137 million sick days. Of these, 15.8 million days were for a stated mental health issue - whether that is stress, depression, anxiety or a more serious condition such as manic depression and schizophrenia - according to Office for National Statistics Labour Force Survey statistics. By contrast, 34 million days were ""lost"" to minor illnesses, like coughs and colds. But Madeleine McGivern, head of workplace wellbeing at charity Mind, says ""people are still wary"" of admitting their sick day is actually due to mental health. ""There is definitely a fear it will affect your career, or that people will judge you and make assumptions that aren't fair or true,"" she says. ""If you're not in a supportive environment, if you do disclose a mental health problem it can be really harmful to you."" Despite the stigma, she says employers are legally required to protect the health and safety of those at work - and this includes mental health problem if it affects a person's day-to-day life. ""If you are unwell for any reason, you should be able to work in a place where you feel you can say 'I'm unwell today because I've got an inflamed back' or 'I've got really high feelings of anxiety at the moment' - they're actually the same thing,"" she says. Mental health: Workers' stories Lisa, a 42-year-old manager, contacted the BBC to say she felt pressured to ""put on a brave face"" and go to work while dealing with depression. ""I've been working in the public sector for over 20 years and have twice had short periods off work through mental health issues,"" she says. She says she feared being stigmatised as ""flaky"" if she took time off. ""The need to 'put on a brave face' was overwhelming and in the end too much for me,"" she says. ""I was prescribed anti-depressants and stayed off work for a few weeks. Even when I returned I wasn't supported and felt further ostracised."" Lisa says her career had ""until now been the defining passion in my life"", adding: ""As a previously high-performing individual the treatment I received felt like a bereavement."" Six months ago, she took time off after dealing with ageing parents and her moving house. ""I took just a few days off work to 'sort myself out', seeing the GP, finding a counsellor and starting an exercise and diet regime."" Now, she says ""I am still battling on"" but that there are still days when she feels her workplace does not care about her as an individual. ""It makes me wonder how other people are coping and what is going on under the surface of a lot of other 'brave faces',"" she says. Large companies are keen to say they are supporting staff and tackling stigma around mental health. Some 500 companies - including Tesco, Unilever and M&S - have made a pledge known as ""Time to Change"", where they commit to tackling problems like anxiety and depression in the workplace. It involves training managers to spot the signs of mental illness among their workers and raise awareness. ""When you look at the reality of the situation, mental health isn't being addressed properly,"" says Sam Gurney, head of equality and strategy at the Trades Union Congress (TUC). Research by the TUC shows just one in four people who have suffered from a mental illness or phobia for one year are in work. ""People can be terrified of saying they have some kind of issue,"" Sam says. ""If you're on a zero-hours contract, you're far less likely to go to your boss and say 'I've got these issues' because they're going to see that person as a problem."" Aaron Lennon returned to training after receiving mental health support Many workplace unions encourage employers to have a sickness procedure that covers issues such as anxiety - and to tackle the root cause of mental issues, for example by training employees to also act as mentors. In light of more professional footballers seeking help for mental health problems, including Everton's Aaron Lennon, the Professional Footballers' Association runs a24-hour helpline and says it is telling players it is ""OK to talk"". Police, fire, ambulance and search-and-rescue teams in England and Wales are unusual in that workers receive government-funded mental health support. Through a Â£1.5m grant, Mind provides emergency staff and volunteers with access to help under a project known as Blue Light. Ms McGivern says the charity also offers legal advice to anyone feeling forced out at work, adding: ""There's something to be said about the way we look for work. ""The power's with the employee to choose where to work and ask - are they going to work with me or break me into a million pieces?"" she says. Can you talk about mental health at work?

"Activist Liu Xiaobo has died after spending eight years in prison ""There is nothing criminal in anything I have done but I have no complaints."" So stated Liu Xiaobo in court in 2009, and in the eight long prison years between then and now, he refused to recant his commitment to democracy. No wonder China's leaders are as afraid of him in death as they were in life. The Chinese Communist Party was once a party of conviction, with martyrs prepared to die for their cause, but it's had nearly 70 years in power to become an ossified and cynical establishment. It imprisons those who demand their constitutional rights, bans all mention of them at home and uses its economic might abroad to exact silence from foreign governments. Under President Xi, China has pursued this repression with great vigour and success. Liu Xiaobo is a rare defeat. Beijing's problem began in 2010 when he won a Nobel Peace Prize. That immediately catapulted Liu Xiaobo into an international A-list of those imprisoned for their beliefs, alongside Nelson Mandela, Aung San Suu Kyi and Carl von Ossietzky. The last in that list may be unfamiliar to some, but to Beijing he's a particularly uncomfortable parallel. Carl von Ossietzky was a German pacifist who won the 1935 Nobel Peace Prize while incarcerated in a concentration camp. Hitler would not allow a member of the laureate's family to collect the award on his behalf. Liu Xiaobo was also serving a prison sentence for subversion when he won the peace prize. Beijing would not let his wife collect the award and instead placed her under house arrest. Liu Xiaobo was represented at the 2010 award ceremony in Oslo by an empty chair and the comparisons began between 21st Century China and 1930s Germany. While in jail, Liu was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. An empty chair was left for him at the ceremony Strict censorship is another shared feature of both cases. Mention of Carl von Ossietzky's 1935 Nobel peace prize was banned in Nazi Germany and the same is true of Liu Xiaobo's award in China today. For a time China even banned the search term ""empty chair"". So he has been an embarrassment to China internationally, but at home few Chinese are aware of him. Even as foreign doctors contradicted the Chinese hospital on his fitness to travel, and Hong Kong saw vigils demanding his release, blanket censorship in mainland China kept the public largely ignorant of the dying Nobel laureate in their midst. China's propaganda war over Liu Xiaobo Who is Chinese dissident Liu Xiaobo? The love that survived a Chinese labour camp What is China accused of? Selective amnesia is state policy in China and from Liu Xiaobo's imprisonment until his death, the government worked hard to erase his memory. To make it hard for family and friends to visit, he was jailed nearly 400 miles from home. His wife Liu Xia was shrouded in surveillance so suffocating that she gradually fell victim to mental and physical ill health. Beijing punished the Norwegian government to the point where Oslo now shrinks from comment on Chinese human rights or Liu Xiaobo's Nobel prize. Liu Xiaobo (left) is seen here with his wife Liu Xia (right) in this undated photo But in death as in life, Liu Xiaobo has refused to be erased. The video footage of the dying man which China released outside the country was clearly intended to prove to the world that everything was done to give him a comfortable death. The unintended consequence is to make him a martyr for China's downtrodden democracy movement and to deliver a new parallel with the Nobel Peace Prize of 1930s Germany. Liu Xiaobo was granted medical parole only in the terminal stage of his illness, and even in hospital he was under close guard with many friends denied access to his bedside. Nearly 80 years ago, Carl von Ossietzky also died in hospital under prison guard after medical treatment came too late to save him. Comparisons with the human rights record and propaganda efforts of Nazi Germany are particularly dismaying for Beijing after a period in which it feels it has successfully legitimised its one-party state on the world stage. At the G20 summit in Hamburg earlier this month, no world leader publicly challenged President Xi over Liu Xiaobo's treatment. With China increasingly powerful abroad and punitive at home, there are few voices raised on behalf of its political dissidents. Liu Xiaobo was not always a dissident. An outspoken academic with a promising career and a passport to travel, until 1989 he'd led a charmed life. The Tiananmen Square democracy movement that year was the fork in his path. After the massacre on June 4th, the costs of defying the Party were tragically clear to all. Most of his contemporaries, and of the generations which followed, judged those costs too high. They chose life, liberty and a stake in the system. Liu Xiaobo was one of the few who took the other fork. He stayed true to the ideals of 1989 for the rest of his life, renouncing first his opportunities to leave China, and then, repeatedly, his liberty. Even in recent years, his lawyers said he had turned down the offer of freedom in exchange for a confession of guilt. Liu Xiaobo once wrote. And in the statement from his trial which was read at his Nobel award ceremony alongside his empty chair, Liu Xiaobo said he felt no ill will towards his jailers and hoped to transcend his personal experience. No wonder such a man seemed dangerous to Beijing. For a jealous ruling party, an outsider with conviction is an affront, and those who cannot be bought or intimidated are mortal enemies. But for Liu Xiaobo the struggle is over. The image of his empty deathbed will now haunt China like the image of his empty chair. And while Beijing continues to intimidate, persecute and punish those who follow his lead, it will not erase the memory of its Nobel prize winner any more than Nazi Germany erased its shame 81 years ago.

"The claim:Brexit Secretary David Davis said in March that the repeal bill would allow the UK Parliament and Welsh, Scottish and Northern Ireland administrations to scrap, amend and improve laws. Reality Check verdict:The bill will repeal the European Communities Act, but it will not change EU laws - it will turn them into UK laws. The UK could, if it wanted to, make changes to those laws after it leaves the EU, probably in 2019. Prime Minister Theresa May says that after Brexit, UK laws will be ""made not in Brussels but in Westminster"". In order to do this, her government will use its Brexit repeal bill, officially calledthe European Union (Withdrawal) Bill,external. The bill will do two things. First, the bill will repeal the European Communities Act, the British law that took the UK into the European Community in 1973 and established the supremacy of EU law over domestic legislation. Second, it will transpose the entire body of EU legislation into domestic law. The UK Parliament currently has no power to repeal EU legislation. It is hard to calculate exactly what proportion of UK laws come from the EU -estimates range from 13% to 60%. Transposing EU legislation into domestic law will not be a simple ""copy and paste"" job.The House of Commons library says,externalit could be ""one of the largest legislative projects ever undertaken in the UK"". Many EU laws, for example on the environment, refer to EU agencies that the UK will no longer be part of when it leaves the Union. The repeal bill will have to find new ways of making those rules part of UK law. Any rules that cannot be transferred will have to be repealed. The government has controversial plans to give ministers the power to make changes to some laws without full Parliamentary scrutiny, which could add further complications. They are known as Henry VIII clauses, after the Statute of Proclamations 1539, which gave the king power to legislate by proclamation. Some opposition politicians are concerned this could mean an executive power grab - the government changing laws without proper scrutiny by MPs. The government says these powers will only be used to deal with EU-related gaps in the law, not to make substantive policy changes. After the bill comes into effect, probably in March 2019, the UK Parliament, and the devolved administrations in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, will be able to amend, scrap or keep laws that originated from the EU. That process is likely to take many years. UPDATE 13 July 2017: This article was updated to include the publication of the bill and its official name.

"Stephen Hough was trapped by his DNA after 40 years The killing of Flintshire schoolgirl Janet Commins made headlines across the UK in 1976. Now, ex-soldier Stephen Hough has been jailed for 12 years for her rape and manslaughter. He was caught by his DNA 40 years on, even though another man spent six years in prison for the crime. On the evening of 7 January 1976, 15-year-old Janet Commins asked her mother Eileen if she could go swimming with her friends. Her mother said no, as she thought Janet looked a bit pale, but the teenager sneaked out of the family's bungalow in King Edward Drive anyway, leaving a note to say she would be back by half past eight. She never came home. Four days later, Janet's lifeless body was found under a thicket near a school playing field by three girls playing hide and seek. She had been suffocated during a savage sexual assault. She had bruising under her chin, abrasions to her neck and a wound in her scalp. Her body had been dragged along the ground and although she was still clothed, both her shoes were missing. Mud found on Janet's clothing indicated part of the attack took place at the town's Gorsedd Circle, a permanent reminder of when the National Eisteddfod came to Flint in 1969. The town - at that time a small, close-knit community - went into shock. ""It had a profound and devastating effect on Flint,"" said local councillor Alex Aldridge. ""It was an extraordinary feeling, I had a daughter who was just under two at the time and to think a young girl had befallen this awful fate, robbed of life. ""It's something you'll never forget. It's still raw and it's still hurtful."" Police mounted a huge manhunt, drafting in about 120 officers to scour the area around the crime scene and conduct house-to-house inquiries. Journalist Paul Mewies, who covered the story at the time, said it made the headlines across the UK. Janet's body was found hidden under bushes near Gwynedd Primary School ""I can remember how not just the town of Flint but a much wider area was shocked by this awful case - the fact that a schoolgirl was killed on a playing field,"" he said. ""It stuck in my mind. I've reported on a number of tragedies over my career but this one does stand out."" Ann Dunn, who lived close to the field where Janet's body was discovered, remembers the town ""swarming with policemen"". ""It was quite upsetting,"" she said. ""There was a lot of fear at the time. People were frightened it would happen again."" About 10,000 people were quizzed by police and all local men aged 17-22 were asked to account for their movements. Among them was Stephen Hough, who had turned 17 the day after Janet's body was found and whose grandparents' house overlooked the area where her body had been hidden. But police ruled him out after he told them he had been stealing petrol on the night of the killing - a crime for which he was later prosecuted and fined. Police scoured the area around the crime scene for clues Their attention turned to Noel Jones, a barely literate 18-year-old traveller from Coedpoeth, Wrexham. He was picked up the day Janet's body was discovered and at first denied all knowledge of the crime. But later his girlfriend told police he had confessed to killing Janet and had asked her to provide him with an alibi. After two days of questioning, he signed two detailed confession statements. On the second day of his murder trial in June 1976, he admitted manslaughter and was sentenced to 12 years in prison. As Noel Jones served his time, Hough must have thought he had got away with it. All local men aged 17-22 were asked to account for their movements on the night Janet died But 41 years on, advances in DNA profiling finally brought him to justice. In 2006, police carried out a cold case review and DNA from a man was identified in samples which had been taken from Janet's body and stored for three decades. Ten years after that, police took a sample of Hough's DNA when he was arrested for sexually assaulting a 15-year-old girl - a crime he later admitted and for which he has been given three years in prison. In a routine cross-matching exercise, it was linked to sperm cells found on Janet's body. Mold Crown Court heard there was a billion-to-one chance it did not belong to Hough. Despite the evidence, Hough insisted he was innocent - repeatedly answering ""no comment"" in police interviews and telling the court he had ""no explanation"" for why his DNA was found on Janet's body. The jury cleared him of murder but convicted him of Janet's rape, sexual assault and manslaughter. The case also throws a spotlight on policing practices 40 years ago. Giving evidence by video link, Noel Jones described the six years he spent in prison as a ""nightmare"" which ""absolutely destroyed my life"". He has never challenged his conviction, but says he is innocent and only confessed because police had pressured and coerced him. The man who led the original investigation, Eric Evans - who later rose to the rank of deputy chief constable - also gave evidence at Hough's trial. He told the court nobody thought to offer Noel Jones a solicitor during the initial stages of his questioning because he wanted to investigate ""properly and thoroughly"". Police could be ""impeded"" by solicitors representing clients, he said, adding that ""there was no requirement in those days for a person to be advised that he could have a solicitor"". It remains to be seen what action will now be taken over Noel Jones' conviction. Residents laid flowers in Janet's memory on Flint's Gorsedd stones after Hough's arrest in September 2016 The Independent Police Complaints Commission is probing the North Wales force's handling of the original case in 1976 and when it was revisited 30 years later. Whatever the outcome of that investigation, Janet's family now knows for sure who killed her. ""I hope there is closure for her mum,"" said councillor Alex Aldridge. ""The law has completed its part but no matter what the verdict, the loss is beyond belief."" ""This young girl never experienced life, possibly getting married, having children, becoming a grandmother. ""Flint will never forget Janet. It's four generations now - over 40 years - and her memory is as fresh today, in a good way, that we are remembering and honouring her name.""

"The Trumps will watch the Bastille Day parade on the Champs-ÃlysÃ©es Not long ago Donald Trump said that Paris was a terrible place. Now he's embraced the city and the nation, strengthening US-France relations. On Thursday morning Mr Trump wore a crisp white shirt, cufflinks and a gold-coloured belt buckle that gleamed. He and the First Lady were arriving in Paris for Bastille Day. On the tarmac at Orly, he kissed his wife on both cheeks, and they headed for separate cars. It was all very French. ""A fun trip,"" one of his aides told me on Air Force One while we flew across the Atlantic. It was a journey that had once seemed unimaginable - and showed how the president's views about the city have changed since the presidential campaign. More importantly, his trip was ushering in a new age of US-France relations, a transatlantic partnership that has roots in the history of both countries. During his two days in Paris, Mr Trump will spend time with Emmanuel Macron, the French president, and dine in a restaurant in the Eiffel Tower. He will watch the Bastille Day parade on the Champs-ÃlysÃ©es. This year marks the 100th anniversary of US forces entering World War One, and for this occasion US and French troops will be marching together in the parade. During the trip the US president will also have a chance to escape the controversies over Russia and other issues that have dominated the news cycle in Washington. The American first couple arrived in Paris early on Thursday It is easy to understand why he would want to get away from Washington. Still the decision to visit Paris and not another city was unexpected - for just about everybody. Mr Macron invited him several weeks ago, and Mr Trump ""was very excited to respond and to accept the invitation,"" said a senior administration official. It was a surprising development - particularly since the US president had just pulled out of the 2015 Paris climate accord. Until recently he had a negative view of the city. ""Paris is no longer the safe city it was,"" he said on MSNBC in 2015. ""They have sections in Paris that are radicalised, where the police refuse to go there. They're petrified."" During the presidential campaign, he said that a friend, Jim, had visited France and told him not to go there. ""France is no longer France,"" said Mr Trump, quoting ""Jim"". He had little evidence for these remarks. Now he seems to have forgotten about them. This morning at the airport he seemed to be having fun. White House officials said that during the visit Mr Macron was likely to bring up the issue of the environment, and that the two world leaders would discuss the matter. They will also talk about Syria as well as about their shared military history. The relationship has had its ups and downs. Under President George W Bush, US-France relations hit a rocky period. Many people in the US criticised the French because they did not support the Iraq war, and some US restaurants stopped serving French fries as a protest against the French nation. ""Freedom fries"" were offered, and breakfast on Air Force One featured ""'freedom toast"" instead of French toast. President Trump angered many in France when he called Paris ""unsafe"" two years ago Over time, though, the two nations and their militaries drew close again. Presidents Trump and Macron will build on this relationship, one that allowed the US and France to work together in the campaign against the Islamic State group. ""There were kinks that needed to be worked out in terms of intelligence sharing,"" said Charles Kupchan, who served as the national security council's senior director for European affairs during the Obama administration. ""But the relationship between the US and the French military is extremely close."" Now the relationship is entering a new phase - one in which the French language and culture are celebrated, however briefly. One of President Trump's aides tried gamely to say a few words in French while we flew on Air Force One. Freedom toast is a thing of the past. Spinach quiche, decorated with fresh blackberries, were served for breakfast. In the end, it is hard to explain the shift in Donald Trump's views of France, and why he has warmed up to Paris. He sometimes acts impulsively and does not fully explain why he has done something. Still he and his aides all seemed happy to leave Washington for a bit - and what better place to go than Paris.

"This video can not be played How I turned football into wine Footballers have long relied on the terraces for inspiration but when Olivier Tebily does so these days, he is looking at rows of vines - not fans. While many footballers' post-playing plans involve staying in the game, the former Ivory Coast international has eschewed that to quietly focus on his second passion. Footballers and alcohol have long gone together, often badly, but the former Birmingham City defender is unique in actually creating the product. What's more, the treble winner with Celtic is doing so in Cognac, home to some of France's - and the world's - most celebrated vineyards. For similar to champagne, only the brandy made in the region can bear the prestigious name Cognac. As for whether the 41-year-old is just another footballer flashing his cash on a pet project, consider this - he bought his first vineyard in his late teens. ""When I signed my first professional contract, I bought two hectares,"" Tebily told the BBC, standing amidst his vines in the south-western French village of Salles-d'Angles. ""I said to myself: 'If I get an injury and football stops, I will have something to carry on with.'"" Tebily played over 80 matches for Birmingham City, many of them in the top-flight ""I did that because I used to work on this land to get a little bit of pocket money to go on holiday - to the seaside with my friends - before turning professional."" ""It's really difficult to become a professional so I bought this straight away to insure myself."" It was 1993 when Tebily signed for second-tier French side Niort, an hour's drive from Poitiers, the south-western city on the edge of the Cognac region where his parents relocated from Abidjan when he was a toddler. It was the start of a journey that took him, following brief spells with Chateauroux and Sheffield United, to the 2000 Africa Cup of Nations, a Scottish treble in 2001 and a four-year Premier League adventure with Birmingham. After suffering a bad injury just weeks after joining Canada's Toronto FC, Tebily cut short a four-and-a-half-year contract to return to the vineyards. There was however a fundamental problem. Tebily is learning how to distil - a key element in creating Cognac since traditional methods require a double-distillation in copper stills Land in Cognac is both expensive and seldom available - and Tebily didn't have enough of it. He ran two local restaurants while waiting for a solution, which was laced with tragedy when it came six years later. After his neighbour's only son died, the retiring Cognac farmer had to decide who to sell his business to last year. ""His son was my friend and we had the same name - it's maybe because of that that he chose me,"" says Tebily. ""Around here, all the winemakers are the same,"" explains the now-retired Jean-Michel Lepine. ""Because I liked football and because Olivier was not unpleasant to me and helped me in tough times - because I've had tough times - I said why not a black man to take over my property? Why not a footballer? Tebily owns 22 hectares after retiring farmer Jean-Michel Lepine chose to sell his business to the Ivorian, a friend of his late son ""I never changed my mind, even though many people tried to stop me."" Following the deal, the first African maker of Cognac - who says he was initially treated like ""a Martian"" - was the proud owner of 22 hectares in a prime location. He also took control of a distillery and although he has yet to master this crucial element of the Cognac process, he is learning from Jean-Michel, now his mentor. When we meet, Tebily is in his vineyard - wearing a Birmingham City fleece as he goes about his daily business, secateurs in hand, carefully tending to his grapes. Such sensitivity may seem incongruous for those who remember the burly defender's on-field reputation. He once finished a matchdespite rupturing knee ligaments,externalin the first half while he famously thundered into one challenge with an opponent despite having lost a boot seconds earlier. Tebily scored few goals during his career but managed two with Celtic, with whom he won a Scottish treble in 2001 ""The local people were really, really surprised by an African footballer trying to do what they are doing,"" says Tebily, who played for Ivory Coast between 1999-2004. ""But I work Monday to Sunday and people are really surprised - they didn't think I would do this work because it's really hard. ""But I don't do this to impress people. I love this work and want to go as far as I can,"" he adds, proclaiming a love of the outdoors. Like many Cognac farmers, Tebily sells most of his produce - around 90% - to the region's bigger companies but he keeps the rest for his own eponymous range. He first produced a bottle in 2013 - smooth upon taste - and although he sells it to local restaurants, he ultimately wants to trade only with Africa. Tebily produced his first brand of Cognac in 2013, five years after quitting football ""That's my dream,"" he says. ""I am already selling to some restaurants in Africa, in Ivory Coast. It's not as much as I want but I'm still happy because it's the beginning and it's working."" After that, and much in the tradition of many of the Cognac farmers, he hopes to hand his business down to his children when he takes a second retirement. Until then, this gentle giant is revelling in being the only African maker of the world's most famous brandy. ""It makes me feel really, really happy and that's why I am fighting to do my business correctly. I try because I am passionate. I love this like I loved football.""

"Drive over London's Westway, and Grenfell Tower demands your attention. It is a black nail that has been hammered into the nation's conscience. In its shadow, the faces of the missing are everywhere - on lamp-posts and bus shelters, railings and walls. Unblinking they stare, it is hard to hold their accusatory gaze. A month after this appalling tragedy, we still don't know exactly who or how many people died at Grenfell Tower. Perhaps that tells us something about our fractured relationship with the people who lived there. Some, perhaps, were happy to be anonymous. But others were simply marginalised and isolated. Only the most vulnerable and desperate would have been eligible for a vacant council flat in the tower. Traditional social housing such as Grenfell has fallen out of fashion. Fewer such homes were built last year than at any time since their invention, with just 6,800 completed in England. The first council blocks were designed for working people from all backgrounds. But over time, social housing has been ""residualised"" - increasingly available only to the most disadvantaged households - and that has consequences for a neighbourhood's relationship with wider society. ""For too long in our country, under governments of both colours, we simply haven't given enough attention to social housing,"" the prime minister told the House of Commons last month. ""In this tower just a few miles from the Houses of Parliament, and in the heart of our great city, people live a fundamentally different life, do not feel the state works for them and are therefore mistrustful of it."" In one of the gardens of the Lancaster West Estate, just a few yards from Grenfell Tower, I meet Pilgrim Tucker, a housing campaigner who has worked with the residents for a number of years and knew some of those who died. ""The fact that more and more it is only the most vulnerable people who can qualify for social housing means that there is a section of people here who become really disengaged,"" she says. Local housing campaigner Pilgrim Tucker: ""There is a section of people here who become really disengaged"" ""There are people who live below the radar, homeless people who have been sofa-surfing, people living with family but not officially on the rent-book, refugees from war, people who have experienced some trauma in their personal lives or have mental health problems - those people, for one reason or another, don't have their voices heard."" The point is made that some residents had expressed their concern about the safety of Grenfell Tower but complain they had been rebuffed by officials. The borough-wide housing body supposed to protect residents, the Kensington and Chelsea Tenant Management Organisation (KCTMO), is far larger than such bodies are usually. Most TMOs cover a single estate, ensuring local people's voice is heard loud and clear. The KCTMO manages almost 9,500 properties and one of the questions for the public inquiry will be whether it became too remote from the safety concerns of a few residents from a block of 120 flats in the north of the borough. ""This is the story of some of those who were in the fire, told through friends and family who were in touch with them during those desperate hours, and in the words of those who survived."" Messages from the Tower We do know that about 250 people escaped Grenfell during the fire, but it is now apparent that 80 are missing or confirmed dead. They had arrived at the tower from all over the world - more than 20 countries were represented. There were families with small children who had recently moved in and pensioners who'd lived in the block for over 40 years.  And then there were the unknown. In a sea of extraordinary affluence - Kensington is the wealthiest constituency in the country - the area around Grenfell Tower is an island of deprivation. The neighbourhood is among the poorest 10% in the UK. It has been like that for centuries. In 1851, Charles Dickens wrote of the parish of Kensington as being ""studded thickly with elegant villas and mansions"", but also an area that included ""a plague spot scarcely equalled for its insalubrity by any other in London"". Echoing the Dickensian observation, London Mayor Sadiq Khan tells me the fire had revealed London as a tale of two cities. A vigil was held near Grenfell Tower to mark four weeks since the fire ""There are many Grenfell Towers where there are hidden Londoners who officials don't know about,"" he says.  ""Their experience of politicians of all parties, local politicians and national politicians, is them letting them down, is them making promises they don't keep, or them never being seen save at election time. ""So don't be surprised if they don't vote, don't be surprised if they don't take part in the normal democratic norms that you and I take for granted. They feel let down for years and years."" The mayor thinks Grenfell has exposed the failure of politicians to ""walk in the shoes of some of those residents"". Theresa May agreed with that sentiment in her statement to MPs: ""Let the legacy of this awful tragedy be that we resolve never to forget these people and instead to gear our policies and our thinking towards making their lives better and bringing them into the political process."" The sense of being isolated from power is very strong in the community around the tower. That helps explain the extraordinary response in the early hours of that Wednesday morning. I met a local woman who had just pulled clothes from her wardrobe and food from her cupboard to give to her neighbours in need. These are people who have come to rely on each other. Donations of food and clothing were quick to arrive after the disaster People don't trust the authorities to take care of them and keep them safe, or be there in their hour of need. The new leader of Kensington and Chelsea council, Elizabeth Campbell, has apologised for the local authority's response to the disaster. ""This is our community, and we have failed it when people needed us the most,"" she said. To help distil the vital community spirit in the area, a boxing club was set up at the foot of Grenfell Tower, now destroyed.  Since the fire, there has been a public fundraiser that has meant the local boys are back in training in the corner of a nearby car park. A boxing club - once housed in Grenfell Tower - now meets in a nearby car park ""We have friends that lived in there, and the kids are in a desperate state,"" boxing trainer Gary McGuiness says.  ""There are more tragedies coming out every day."" The club is about building the resilience of children from tough backgrounds - resilience desperately needed right now. ""It's harrowing really that we might never know some of those victims, nameless people,"" mother and club volunteer Colleen Spencer Gittens says. ""You can still see missing posters around when you are walking around in shops, it's very, very sad and I wouldn't have expected something like that to happen in the 21st Century in London to be honest."" That is the point.  For something like this to have happened in one of the richest boroughs in one of the richest cities in one of the richest countries in the world is not just unexpected. Grenfell Tower is black with urgent and unanswered questions.

"Madalyn Parker, a US web developer, sparked a debate about workplace attitudes to mind problems aftertweeting,externalan email from her boss. Her boss said she was an ""example to us all"" by telling colleagues she was taking sick leave for her mental health - but would British managers be similarly supportive? In an email titled ""Where's Madalyn"", she told colleagues: ""I'm taking today and tomorrow to focus on my mental health. Hopefully I'll be back next week refreshed and back to 100%"". Chief executive Ben Congleton replied to the message, saying: ""I can't believe this is not standard practice at all organisations,"" adding: ""You are an example to us all, and help cut through the stigma so we can all bring our whole selves to work."" In the UK, there is no legal difference between taking a mental health sick day and a day off for a physical problem like a back problem. Last year, Britons took 137 million sick days. Of these, 15.8 million days were for a stated mental health issue - whether that is stress, depression, anxiety or a more serious condition such as manic depression and schizophrenia - according to Office for National Statistics Labour Force Survey statistics. By contrast, 34 million days were ""lost"" to minor illnesses, like coughs and colds. But Madeleine McGivern, head of workplace wellbeing at charity Mind, says ""people are still wary"" of admitting their sick day is actually due to mental health. ""There is definitely a fear it will affect your career, or that people will judge you and make assumptions that aren't fair or true,"" she says. ""If you're not in a supportive environment, if you do disclose a mental health problem it can be really harmful to you."" Despite the stigma, she says employers are legally required to protect the health and safety of those at work - and this includes mental health problem if it affects a person's day-to-day life. ""If you are unwell for any reason, you should be able to work in a place where you feel you can say 'I'm unwell today because I've got an inflamed back' or 'I've got really high feelings of anxiety at the moment' - they're actually the same thing,"" she says. Mental health: Workers' stories Lisa, a 42-year-old manager, contacted the BBC to say she felt pressured to ""put on a brave face"" and go to work while dealing with depression. ""I've been working in the public sector for over 20 years and have twice had short periods off work through mental health issues,"" she says. She says she feared being stigmatised as ""flaky"" if she took time off. ""The need to 'put on a brave face' was overwhelming and in the end too much for me,"" she says. ""I was prescribed anti-depressants and stayed off work for a few weeks. Even when I returned I wasn't supported and felt further ostracised."" Lisa says her career had ""until now been the defining passion in my life"", adding: ""As a previously high-performing individual the treatment I received felt like a bereavement."" Six months ago, she took time off after dealing with ageing parents and her moving house. ""I took just a few days off work to 'sort myself out', seeing the GP, finding a counsellor and starting an exercise and diet regime."" Now, she says ""I am still battling on"" but that there are still days when she feels her workplace does not care about her as an individual. ""It makes me wonder how other people are coping and what is going on under the surface of a lot of other 'brave faces',"" she says. Large companies are keen to say they are supporting staff and tackling stigma around mental health. Some 500 companies - including Tesco, Unilever and M&S - have made a pledge known as ""Time to Change"", where they commit to tackling problems like anxiety and depression in the workplace. It involves training managers to spot the signs of mental illness among their workers and raise awareness. ""When you look at the reality of the situation, mental health isn't being addressed properly,"" says Sam Gurney, head of equality and strategy at the Trades Union Congress (TUC). Research by the TUC shows just one in four people who have suffered from a mental illness or phobia for one year are in work. ""People can be terrified of saying they have some kind of issue,"" Sam says. ""If you're on a zero-hours contract, you're far less likely to go to your boss and say 'I've got these issues' because they're going to see that person as a problem."" Aaron Lennon returned to training after receiving mental health support Many workplace unions encourage employers to have a sickness procedure that covers issues such as anxiety - and to tackle the root cause of mental issues, for example by training employees to also act as mentors. In light of more professional footballers seeking help for mental health problems, including Everton's Aaron Lennon, the Professional Footballers' Association runs a24-hour helpline and says it is telling players it is ""OK to talk"". Police, fire, ambulance and search-and-rescue teams in England and Wales are unusual in that workers receive government-funded mental health support. Through a Â£1.5m grant, Mind provides emergency staff and volunteers with access to help under a project known as Blue Light. Ms McGivern says the charity also offers legal advice to anyone feeling forced out at work, adding: ""There's something to be said about the way we look for work. ""The power's with the employee to choose where to work and ask - are they going to work with me or break me into a million pieces?"" she says. Can you talk about mental health at work?

"This video can not be played Liu Xiaobo: China's most influential dissident Nobel laureate Liu Xiaobo, who was China's most prominent human rights and democracy advocate, has died aged 61. The activist had been serving an 11-year prison term for ""subversion"" and was recently moved to a hospital for treatment for terminal liver cancer. A university professor turned tireless rights campaigner, Mr Liu was branded a criminal by authorities. The Nobel Committee said the Chinese government bore a ""heavy responsibility for his premature death"". The campaigner was repeatedly jailed throughout his life. When not in prison, he was subject to severe restrictions while his wife, Liu Xia, was placed under house arrest. Mr Liu died ""peacefully"", surrounded by his wife and other relatives, a doctor who treated him said. His final words to Liu Xia were: ""Live on well,"" theSouth China Morning Post,externalreported. Liu Xiaobo played a significant role in the Tiananmen Square student protests of June 1989, which ended in bloodshed when they were quashed by government troops. He and other activists negotiated the safe exit of several hundred demonstrators, and have been credited with saving their lives. He was subsequently placed in a detention centre and released in 1991. Mr Liu's campaign to free those detained during the Tiananmen Square protests landed him in a labour camp in north-eastern China for three years, but he was permitted to marry poet Liu Xia there in 1996. Liu Xiaobo and his wife, Liu Xia, in 2002 He was later freed, and continued to campaign for democracy. The 11-year jail term was handed down in 2009 after he compiled, with other intellectuals, theCharter 08manifesto. It called for an end to one-party rule and the introduction of multi-party democracy. Mr Liu was found guilty of trying to overthrow the state. He was a pro-democracy figurehead for activists outside mainland China, although many of his compatriots were unaware of his struggles because the authorities rigorously censored news about him. Who was Liu Xiaobo? The activist in his own words Mr Liu's absence at the 2010 Nobel ceremony was marked by an empty chair The dissident won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2010 for his ""long and non-violent struggle for fundamental human rights in China"", but he was not permitted to travel to Norway to accept it. He was the second person to receive the award while in prison - the other was the German pacifist Carl von Ossietzky, who won in 1935 while incarcerated in a Nazi concentration camp. China media silent on Liu Xiaobo death Love that survived a labour camp By Carrie Gracie, China editor Chinese authorities refused Liu Xiaobo's dying request to be allowed to travel abroad for treatment. Instead he died as he had lived, under the close watch of the one-party state. The life and death of this Nobel laureate underline the cost of political defiance in China. Liu Xiaobo had enjoyed a comfortable early career as a university professor, but the massacre which followed the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests was the fork in his path. Where many gave up demanding democracy, he stood firm and was jailed repeatedly. When he won the Nobel, he was serving a prison sentence for subversion. A furious Beijing subsequently placed his wife under house arrest. Only in a hospital ward in the last days of his life have this suffering couple been reunited, to be parted again by his death. More from Carrie Gracie In the weeks leading up to his death, Mr Liu's case became mired in international controversy. Several Western countries urged China to allow Mr Liu to leave the country to seek palliative care elsewhere. A German and an American doctor who recently visited and examined him in a hospital in the north-eastern city of Shenyang said he would be able to travel abroad. But Chinese medical experts insisted that he was too ill to travel. This video can not be played Liu Xiaobo's friend and fellow dissident Yang Jianli pays emotional tribute Mr Liu's condition deteriorated shortly after he was admitted to hospital, according to Shenyang's First Hospital of China Medical University. In abrief statement,external, Shenyang local officials said that Mr Liu had suffered multiple organ failure, and that efforts to save the activist had failed. At a press conference, Teng Yue'e, the doctor who led the team treating Mr Liu, said: ""He was not in any pain at that moment, he was very much at peace, because all of his relatives said their goodbyes beforehand."" Liu Xiaobo memorialised in social art This video can not be played Ai Weiwei: Liu Xiaobo was a symbol to China's human rights TheUN High Commissioner for Human Rights,external, Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein, said Mr Liu ""was and will continue to be an inspiration"" and urged China to guarantee Liu Xia freedom of movement, allowing her to travel abroad should she want to. TheNobel Committee,externalsaid: ""The Chinese Government bears a heavy responsibility for his premature death."" Human rights groupAmnesty International,externalsaid Mr Liu was ""a giant of human rights... a man of fierce intellect, principle, wit and above all humanity"".

US Secretary of StateRex Tillerson,externalsaid: ""Mr Liu dedicated his life to the betterment of his country and humankind, and to the pursuit of justice and liberty"", and called on China to release the activist's wife from house arrest. British Foreign SecretaryBoris Johnson:,external""Liu Xiaobo should have been allowed to choose his own medical treatment overseas, which the Chinese authorities repeatedly denied him. This was wrong and I now urge them to lift all restrictions on his widow, Liu Xia."" Taiwan's President Tsai Ing-wen said on Facebook: ""The Chinese dream should not be swaggering, the Chinese dream should include the dream of Liu Xiaobo: the implementation of democracy, so that every Chinese person can have freedom and dignity."" German ChancellorAngela Merkel,external: ""I mourn Liu Xiaobo, the courageous fighter for human rights and freedom of expression."" French Foreign Minister Jean-YvesLe Drian: ""Despite long periods of detention and for more than 30 years, he never stopped defending - with courage - fundamental rights and freedom of speech."" Coverage on mainland China has been muted - with only a few short reports in English. Xinhua,externaland CCTV news have issued short statements on their English sites stating that Liu Xiaobo, ""convicted of subversion of state power"", has died. Communist Party mouthpiece Global Times said Mr Liu was ""a victim led astray"" by the West. ""The Chinese side has been focusing on Liu's treatment, but some Western forces are always attempting to steer the issue in a political direction, hyping the treatment as a 'human rights' issue,""the Global Times,externaladded. Official Chinese-language news sites on the mainland appear to have steered clear of reporting the story altogether. Social media users have also noticed attempts from government censors to mute reaction online.

"It's a year since Theresa May became prime minister. Few could have predicted that she would end up, 12 months on, with a smaller Commons majority and diminished authority. Brexit has been the dominant issue of her time in office so far. Having triggered Article 50 at the end of March, kickstarting a two-year timetable before leaving the EU, she called a general election for 8 June, asking voters to strengthen her hand in Brexit negotiations. Instead, support for the Labour Party jumped and the Conservatives ended up as the largest party but deprived of an overall majority. When she first took up office last summer, Theresa May was extremely popular. Her approval rating then fell away a bit, but picked up again in the new year. In April, with the Conservatives riding high in the polls, the PM felt emboldened to call a general election, despite not needing to do so for another three years. After a botched U-turn on social care and a widely criticised manifesto, her approval rating nosedived, and fell even further after her party lost seats at the polls. Now, a majority of the British public think she is handling her job badly. Jeremy Corbyn was extremely unpopular when Theresa May became prime minister. By the time she called the election in April, Mr Corbyn's approval rating had slid even further, making him one of the most unpopular politicians of modern times. But during the election campaign his popularity improved dramatically, increasing by 39 percentage points between mid-April and mid-June. June 2017: Jeremy Corbyn addresses Glastonbury festivalgoers This reversal - and Mrs May's corresponding decline - is one of the most rapid shifts in the history of British political polling. Now Mr Corbyn has a positive approval rating, meaning more people think he is doing a good job than a bad one. The catalyst for the turnaround in the two leaders' fortunes was Theresa May calling the election. The Conservatives lost the overall majority won by David Cameron two years earlier, confounding opinion polls and political pundits. They won 318 seats, comfortably more than Mr Corbyn's resurgent Labour Party. But that was 13 fewer than last time, leaving Theresa May just short of being able to form a government on her own. After more than two weeks of haggling, she signed a confidence-and-supply deal with the Democratic Unionist Party of Northern Ireland, which has 10 MPs. The general election left Theresa May dependent on the votes of the DUP, led by Arlene Foster It means the DUP will vote with the Conservatives on key votes - like Brexit - in exchange for more public money going to Northern Ireland. The parliamentary arithmetic is now very precarious - just a handful of rebel Conservative or DUP MPs could lead to a defeat of the government on key votes. While June 8 was a very bad night for Conservatives in England and Wales, the party did very well in Scotland, winning 13 MPs, up from just one. This renaissance came at the expense of the SNP, who also lost seats to Labour and the Liberal Democrats. In March, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon had called for a second independence referendum to take place before the spring of 2019, coinciding with the expected conclusion of the UK's Brexit negotiations. But following the SNP's setback in June, Ms Sturgeon told the Scottish Parliament she was putting these second referendum plans on hold. SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon has now put referendum plans on hold Although the SNP won comfortably more votes and seats than any other party in Scotland, its position is weaker than a year ago, and Scottish independence seems a more distant prospect. If the SNP has had a rough year, the UK Independence Party has had a catastrophic one. Theresa May's tough stance on Brexit has left many questioning the purpose of a party founded to get Britain out of the EU. UKIP has seen a dramatic downturn in fortunes. It won more votes than any other party in the 2014 European Parliament elections, and almost four million voted for the party in the 2015 general election. But on 8 June, the party got fewer than 600,000 votes, just one month after a disastrous set of local election results. UKIP's decline is part of a bigger trend that few people predicted a year ago. UKIP's leader Paul Nuttall stood down after the 2017 election More than 80% of voters backed either Labour or the Conservatives in the 1979 general election, but this proportion declined steadily, hovering around two-thirds between 2005 and 2015. But in June more than 80% of voters backed Labour or the Tories - UKIP was crushed and the Liberal Democrats failed to bounce back from a disastrous showing in 2015. Net migration - the difference between the number of people moving to the UK and the number of people leaving - has fallen significantly. A lot of the drop is explained by a decrease in people moving from the EU8 states - the Czech Republic, Hungary, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Slovakia and Slovenia - and an increase in people moving back to those countries. The 248,000 figure is still significantly above the government's target of reducing net migration to the tens of thousands. However, the fall over the whole year could be bigger than what's been reported so far. There's a time lag of over five months before the data is published so we'll have to wait until December to see the overall change for the last year. The rate of inflation has steadily increased. At 2.9%, prices are going up faster than at any time since June 2013. One factor behind the rise is the decline in the value of the pound after the EU referendum. A weaker pound makes imports more expensive and pushes up prices. The weak pound has pushed prices upwards for shoppers Other countries have also seen slightly higher inflation - partly because of a recovery in the price of oil and other commodities, as well as a  small improvement in the global economy. But it's notable that the UK has the highest inflation rate of the advanced economies. After a few years bumping along below the Bank of England's official target rate of 2%, the recent increase isn't necessarily all bad. But in April inflation overtook wage growth which has now slipped to 1.8%. That means the UK is back to the situation it faced in the years after the financial crisis. With price increases outstripping wages, workers are getting poorer on average in real terms. There's been better news on jobs. The unemployment rate has been falling steadily for almost six years and that has continued in the past 12 months. At 4.5% it's at its lowest rate since 1975. There are 32 million people in work and three-quarters of 16-64-year-olds are employed - the highest figure since comparable records began in 1971. Some other major economies, including the US, Germany and Japan, have even lower unemployment. But the UK is faring considerably better than France, Italy and most other EU countries. The result of last year's referendum was a 52% to 48% victory for Leave. There's no clear evidence that people's views have changed since then. YouGov's trend data shows no significant movement since last summer. There's certainly no evidence of a tidal wave of Brexit regret. And another YouGovpoll,externalin May found that about half of people who had voted Remain thought the government had a duty to implement the referendum result. There's little evidence to suggest people have changed their minds about Brexit since the EU referendum This could change of course. Since the election there have been one or two polls suggesting a small movement away from a pro-Brexit position but not a clear shift. At the crucial third reading vote in the House of Commons, MPs voted for the Bill giving the government authority to trigger Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty by 494 to 122. Almost all Conservative MPs voted in favour - only Ken Clarke voted against - as did most Labour MPs, who were whipped to do so, the DUP, UUP and UKIP's then MP Douglas Carswell. On the other side, 52 Labour rebels lined up with the SNP, Lib Dems, Plaid Cymru and Caroline Lucas, the only Green Party MP. The UK's Brussels ambassador delivered a letter from Theresa May to Donald Tusk, the EU Council President, on 29 March, which formally started the withdrawal process. It will last two years unless there's unanimous support for an extension among EU member states.

"Christine Rowe was a full-time carer for her husband Brian A father-of-two has been jailed for eight years and eight months for killing a grandmother while sniffing cocaine at the wheel of his van. Ryan Reardon, 34, hit seven other vehicles in his van in Newport before crashing into 70-year-old Christine Rowe's car head-on, killing her and seriously injuring her husband Brian. Cardiff Crown Court heard he was speeding on the wrong side of the road. Reardon, from Blackwood in Caerphilly, ran off but police caught him that day. He was more than six times over the legal drug-drive limit when he jumped red lights and barged through other cars at about 19:00 BST on 5 June near Beechwood Park in bad weather conditions, the court heard. Reardon, a managing director of an air conditioning company, was driving at 59mph in a 30mph zone. Prosecutor James Wilson said: ""It was the culmination of prolonged, persistent driving by the defendant characterised by aggression and disregard for other road users. Ryan Reardon was taking drugs at the wheel, the court was told ""His driving was aggravated further by consumption of cocaine, 6.5 times over the prescribed limit. He was consuming the drugs while driving."" Reardon admitted causing death by dangerous driving, causing serious injury by dangerous driving, failing to stop and possession of class A drugs. Witnesses reported seeing Reardon tailgating and barging into other cars, and he was confronted by other drivers but continued. One witness said: ""I have never seen any driving as bad or dangerous in my life. He was driving like a man possessed."" Mr Rowe, 80, had to be cut out of the crushed car and spent four weeks in hospital with multiple fractures to his ribs. He also now suffers from short term memory loss. His wife had been his full time carer. Reardon was disqualified from driving for 14 years and the court heard that he had previous convictions for dangerous driving. Christine Rowe cared full-time for her husband Brian Mrs Rowe's daughter-in-law Joanne Tracey said: ""Christine loved all her children and grandchildren with a ferocity that is hard to explain. ""When we were in the hospital family room, I have never seen such pain, confusion, sadness and shock in one room. ""Christine cared full-time for her husband Brian, who has asked several times where she is despite being told she is dead."" Jailing him, Recorder of Cardiff Judge Eleri Rees said: ""Your driving can only be described as appalling. ""You tailgated, undertook and drove at aggressive speeds causing drivers to take evasive action. ""You left a trail of damage and shocked drivers in your wake. ""No sentence this court passes can restore Mrs Rowe to her family or adequately reflect the loss or grief."" Following sentencing, Janine Davies of the Crown Prosecution Service said: ""It is sometimes difficult to decide which charge reflects the manner of driving properly in law, but in this instance it was clear.  Reardon had collided with several vehicles immediately before the fatal collision where he had simply tried to push his way between two lines of traffic. ""His consumption of cocaine was a factor in this case and the danger he posed to other road users that day was significant. ""Our sympathies are extended to the Rowe family for their loss,"" she added.

"Being an atheist in Pakistan can be life-threatening. But behind closed doors, non-believers are getting together to support one another. How do they survive in a nation where blasphemy carries a death sentence? Omar, named after one of Islam's most revered caliphs, has rejected the faith of his forefathers. He is one of the founding members of an online group - a meeting point for the atheists of Pakistan. But even there he must stay on his guard. Members use fake identities. ""You have to be careful who you are befriending,"" he says. One man contacted Omar to say he had visited his Facebook profile and printed out pictures of him with his family. ""You cannot be safe,"" Omar says. In Pakistan, posting about atheism online can have serious consequences. Under a recently passed cyber-crime law, it is now illegal to post content online - even in a private forum - that could be deemed blasphemous. The government took out adverts in national newspapers asking members of the public to report any content they believe could constitute blasphemy. And the law is being enforced. In June this year, in the first case of its kind, Taimoor Raza wassentenced to deathfor posting blasphemous content on Facebook. ""Zahir"" is an online activist who uses social media to express atheist ideas and comment on Pakistani politics ""Dear diary, I've been through four Twitter accounts in one year now. The last one got blocked last night. It doesn't matter how vague my details are or if the pictures I use are generic. It's as if someone is watching me. Every time this happens I feel that I should just give up. They want to silence me."" As a result, atheists feel their ability to publicly question the existence of God is threatened. Omar believes the government is at war with atheist bloggers. ""A good friend of mine used to write against religious fundamentalism,"" he says. ""We used to run the [online] group together. I came to know he was very severely tortured. Once you are abducted, there is a high chance your body will come in a bag. ""The state is doing it deliberately, so those remaining get a sign that if you go beyond your limits you will also be facing things like this."" This year, six activists have reportedly been abducted after posting on forums that are pro-atheist and anti-government. One of those activists spoke to the BBC but does not want to be identified. He believes that Pakistan's intelligence service wants to stamp out not only criticism of Islam but also criticism of the state. In his view, the government is trying to enforce the notion that a good citizen must be a good Muslim. ""Hamza"" is a blogger and a founding member of an online atheist forum ""Dear diary. Some people have called it an arrest but it was an abduction. I was held for 28 days. They wouldn't identify themselves but I'm sure it was the military. There were eight days of torture and 20 days for healing. My whole body was black. They made me sign a statement that said I regretted what I and done and that I would not engage with political or religious blogging. And that my family could be target if I spoke to the media."" Pakistan is, this year, celebrating its 70th year of independence. Since 1956, it has been an Islamic republic. Many atheists feel the nation is more monolithic than ever before. In recent years, they say, the Islamic faith has become more visible in public life. Saudi-style dress codes are increasingly enforced. Television evangelists shape pop culture and to be Pakistani is increasingly linked to being a devout Muslim. Although atheism is not technically illegal in Pakistan, apostasy is deemed to be punishable by death in some interpretations of Islam. As a result, speaking publicly can be life-threatening. Many Pakistani atheists meet at secret, invitation-only gatherings. The Atheists of Lahore have monthly get-togethers in guarded buildings or private homes. One of those in attendance explains: ""It's like a secret society. It's a bubble where we can talk. It's not all about Richard Dawkins or Sam Harris. We may just talk about how things are going. It's a place where you can let your hair down and truly be yourself."" At these meet-ups, atheists are predominantly affluent, English-speaking city-dwellers. Money does grant a degree of privilege and protection from those who are hostile towards godlessness. But many self-identified atheists also live in Pakistan's villages. ""Suhaib"" recently graduated from university in Punjab ""Dear diary, this afternoon at university an acquaintance approached me and said: 'I want to have a debate with you. I heard you're an atheist.' It was an expression of disbelief, as if to ask: 'How do you function?' She wanted to know where I get my morals from. For her, morality comes from religion and without faith you can't be expected to have morals. Later that afternoon I text all my friends.  'Stop telling people I'm an atheist. I don't want to die.'  I must learn that discretion is a good thing."" Zafer was once the muezzin, the man who recited the call to prayer at his village mosque. He used to pray five times a day and was a student of Islamic theology. When he got a job in IT and moved out of his family home, he found his views on religion had changed. ""My family noticed a shift. My mother thought someone had cast a spell on me. I was given holy water to drink and blessed food to eat. She thought it would break the spell. ""These days, I will go along to Friday prayers and celebrate Eid just as a social ritual. My family know I'm not a believer but they give me the space to be myself - as long as I'm not too vocal about being an atheist. ""If you're willing to do certain things - have etiquette, respect your parents and be appropriate in public - you can get away with being a disbeliever."" Mobeen Azhar's documentary Diary of a Pakistani Atheist will be broadcast on BBC World Service'sHeart and Soul on Friday 14 July at 13:32 BST and available to listen afterwardson iPlayer. The Ministry of Information Technology declined my request for an interview, saying the campaign promoting the cyber-crime laws was ""simply about raising awareness"". They would not comment on the alleged abduction of online activists. Kunwar Khuldune Shahid is a journalist who has documented the government's response to atheism in the public domain. He believes online atheist activists are being abducted by the government because challenging religion and challenging the state often go hand-in-hand. ""There are two holy cows in Pakistan,"" he says. ""One is the army, the other is Islam. Any person challenging one of these holy cows would, more often than not, be talking about the other as well. The sites whose administrators were abducted were critical of the army and government policy, so blasphemy became a convenient tool. ""In one go, they simply silenced a wide array of critics.""

"Christina Grant moved in with family in Australia after the death of a son in Scotland A 96-year-old woman is preparing to return to Scotland from Australia after a visa wrangle. Christina Grant's family, who live in New South Wales, flew her to Australia following the death of her son and carer, Robert, in February 2015. Her family believed they had met the requirements of her visa, which has expired. Immigration officials said they had been working with the family and made no arrangements to remove Mrs Grant. However, the grandmother's family told BBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland programme that they had not found Australia's immigration department helpful and had gone to specialists for assistance. They could apply for a new visa but were told that this could take 30 years to resolve. The Grant family had hoped that because of her age and state of her heath that her situation might be treated a special case. Mrs Grant's surviving son Allan and his wife Diane believe they have done everything to meet the rules of her visa after she moved to live with them in Australia. Mrs Grant is booked on a flight back to the UK on 26 July. Her family told BBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland programme that the alternatives were the possibility of deportation or ""years of limbo"" while trying to obtain a new visa. Mrs Grant, who is partially sighted and has dementia, was living near Grantown on Spey in the Highlands. Her son Robert had been helping to look after her. Because of the state of her health, Allan and Diane asked her to move to Australia and live with them. They applied for a visa for her to come to Australia. A condition of her visa was that she had to depart Australia once every 12 months but could return. Concerned that Mrs Grant was not fit enough to fly out of Australia to meet this requirement, her family booked her on a cruise into an area of French territory in the Pacific Ocean. They believed that this trip would meet the visa requirements. However, after the cruise the Grants were told by the Department of Immigration and Border Protection that the visa rules had not been met. Diane told Good Morning Scotland that immigration specialists had told the family that applying for a new visa could take up to 30 years to come through. They are now preparing to fly with Mrs Grant back to Scotland. Diane said: ""We will have to help her find a home over there. ""We have our own life here in Australia and, while I don't want to live there, Mum wants to live here."" The Grants have highlighted their case in an effort to alert other families that may find themselves in the same situation. The Department of Immigration and Border Protection said all visitors to Australia must hold a valid visa for the duration of their stay and comply with the conditions of that visa. A spokesperson said: ""The department is familiar with Ms Grant's case and is not making any arrangements to remove her from Australia. ""The tourist stream visitor visa is normally valid for stays of up to 12 months and, as with all visitor visas, is designed to facilitate temporary visits to Australia rather than long-term stays or residence. ""Conscious of her circumstances, the department has been working with Ms Grant to resolve her visa status, since her visitor visa expired. ""Ms Grant has no current visa applications with the department."" PICTURES: Were you at Best Bar None Awards? Temperatures to plummet to -15C in north and north-east: How cold is your area?

"Akbar Al Baker boasted that the average age of his company's cabin crew was ""only 26"" The chief executive of Qatar Airways has apologised for comments he made about flight attendants that were condemned as both sexist and ageist. In aspeech,externalat a dinner in Ireland last week, Akbar Al Baker said US airlines were ""crap"" and their passengers were ""always being served by grandmothers"". He also boasted that ""the average age of my cabin crew is only 26"". On Wednesday, Mr Al Baker said the ""careless"" remarks did not reflect his ""true sentiments about cabin crew"". ""Competition among air carriers is robust. This is healthy, especially for our passengers, but our competition must remain respectful,"" he wrote in aletter,externalto the Association of Flight Attendants (AFA), a US trade union that has some 50,000 members from 20 airlines. ""For the cabin crew serving aboard all air carriers, professionalism, skill and dedication are the qualities that matter. I was wrong to imply that other factors, like age, are relevant,"" he added. The AFA's president, Sara Nelson,said,externalshe accepted the apology. Qatar Airways sees US laptop ban lifted Qatar wants 10% of American Airlines Saudi revokes Qatar Airways' licence On Monday, after a video of Mr Al Baker's speech was posted online, Ms Nelsonaccused,externalhim of confirming ""what AFA has said all along: Qatar Airways thrives on misogyny and discrimination. ""Qatar is not only seeking to choke out US aviation, but also the 300,000 good jobs built through opportunity created on the principle of equality."" She added: ""When there's an emergency on board, a flight attendant's gender, age, weight, height, race or sexuality simply do not matter. What matters is effective safety and security training, along with experience on the job."" Qatar Airways plans to buy a 10% stake in American Airlines The vice-president of flight service for American Airlines, Jill Surdek, also said in a message to employees that Mr Al Baker's remarks were ""incredibly offensive"". The controversy comes amid a row between US carriers and Qatar Airways, Etihad Airways and Emirates Airlineâ over alleged state support for them. On Wednesday, American Airlines announced that it was cancelling a code-share agreement with Qatar Airways and Etihad Airways as ""an extension of our stance against the illegal subsidies"". The airlines deny receiving state subsidies. Mr Al Baker said he was disappointed with the decision on Thursday, but that he would proceed with plans to buy a 10% stake in American Airlines. ""Our stock purchase request and filing is going ahead as normal. We had to clarify certain questions of the regulator, which we compiled with,"" he told reporters.

"This video can not be played David Davis defends 'repeal bill' plans The Scottish and Welsh governments have threatened to block the key Brexit bill which will convert all existing EU laws into UK law. The repeal bill,external, published earlier, is also facing opposition from Labour and other parties in the Commons. Ministers are ""optimistic"" about getting it through and have promised an ""ongoing intense dialogue"" with the devolved administrations. No 10 said it had to be passed or ""there will be no laws"" after Brexit. Brexit Secretary David Davis called it ""one of the most significant pieces of legislation that has ever passed through Parliament"". He rejected claims ministers were giving themselves ""sweeping powers"" to make changes to laws as they are repatriated. It will be up to MPs if they want a say on the ""technical changes"" ministers plan to make to legislation, he told the BBC. What is the Repeal Bill all about? Brexit: All you need to to know EU stands firm on citizen rights UK could be 'associate' of EU nuclear body Labour says it will not support the bill in its current form and is demanding concessions in six areas, including the incorporation of the European Charter of Fundamental Rights into British law. The party wants guarantees workers' rights will be protected and also want curbs on the power of government ministers to alter legislation without full parliamentary scrutiny. Leader Jeremy Corbyn, who was in Brussels earlier for a meeting with the EU's chief negotiator Michel Barnier, said: ""Far too much of it seems to be a process where the government... will be able to bypass Parliament. ""We will make sure there is full parliamentary scrutiny. We have a Parliament where the government doesn't have a majority, we have a country which voted in two ways on Leave or Remain. ""The majority voted to leave and we respect that, but they didn't vote to lose jobs and they didn't vote to have Parliament ridden roughshod over."" Formally known as the European Union (Withdrawal) Bill, the draft legislation is a key plank of the government's Brexit strategy The first line of the bill says the European Communities Act 1972, which took Britain into the EU, will be ""repealed on exit day"" This will end the supremacy of EU law and stop the flow of new regulations from Brussels But all existing laws derived from the EU will continue to be in force - they can be changed or scrapped by further legislation The bill does not detail policies line-by-line but transfers all regulations into domestic law It gives the UK two years after Brexit to correct any ""deficiencies"" arising from the transfer The Conservatives are relying on Democratic Unionist Party support to win key votes after losing their Commons majority in the general election, but could face a revolt from Remain supporting backbenchers. BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg said there could be ""parliamentary guerrilla warfare"" on the bill, as opposition parties and ""Remainer Tories"" try to ""put their version of Brexit, not Theresa May's, on to the statute book"". The repeal bill is not expected to be debated by MPs until the Autumn, but will need to have been passed by the time the UK leaves the EU - which is due to happen in March 2019.

"Students do not realise how few hours they might get in lectures and seminars ""This is only going to end one way,"" says Lord Adonis, Labour peer and one of the architects of an earlier version of tuition fees. ""Almost no-one inside or outside government thinks they will survive."" Before last month's general election, the position of tuition fees in England looked unassailable. The government had rammed through legislation at the last minute, increasing fees to Â£9,250 per year. And the proposal by Labour to scrap tuition fees had been met by university leaders with a polite shrug. But there seems to have been a huge sea-change in attitudes. So what has made such a difference? ""The straw that broke the camel's back,"" says Lord Adonis, has been ""indefensible"" interest rates of 6.1%. Lord Adonis says tuition fees are now as politically doomed as the poll tax This has focused attention on the scale of debt from higher fees and interest rates - spinning upwards to Â£50,000 so far for an average graduate, with fees set to increase every year with inflation. ""It's about as bad a political gambit as you could imagine,"" says Lord Adonis. ""Can you seriously see the Conservatives going in to the next election with fees at Â£10,000, interest rates at 7% and debts at Â£60,000?"" He argues that a reformed version of the fee system could have survived with cross-party support, but now it has become irredeemably toxic. Even if fees were ""cut drastically"", he says, it would still not be enough for young people, who will want them to be completely scrapped. And a partial reduction would still mean a financial black hole, with ""lots of political pain for not much gain"". The inescapable outcome, says Lord Adonis, is that an entirely different approach will be needed to fund universities. The sense of political doom hanging over fees, he says, reminds him of the poll tax. Lord Adonis is the type of reforming Labour politician the Conservatives like to applaud. With a minority government hanging by a parliamentary thread, any cross-party push on reforming fees would cause ministers deep problems. And concerns about fees are emerging. Justine Greening says removing fees would mean limiting places Conservative MP Nick Boles, writing in the Guardian, saidcharging high interest before students had even finished their courses was ""simply unacceptable"".,external The meter on interest charges starts running as soon as courses begin, with the Institute for Fiscal Studies saying students would owe Â£5,800 in interest charges before they even graduated. ""It is unutterably depressing for hard-working students to see the amount they owe spiralling upwards, before they have even started paying it off,"" Mr Boles wrote. 10 charts that show the effect of tuition fees Student debt rising to Â£50,000, says IFS Student loan debt to be sold to private investors The election saw huge swings to Labour in university seats - and any Conservative MP defending a narrow majority might want to review a system that will see tuition fees rising every year. This is also a very middle-England issue. More than half a million young people start university each year. According to the IFS, middle earners could end up paying Â£40,000 in interest charges, on top of what they have borrowed. Prof David Green, vice-chancellor of the University of Worcester, says the current fee arrangements have ""lost credibility"" when they become a long-term pay cut for people such as nurses. For nurses and midwives, he says, it will mean ""their debt never diminishes in real terms until it is eventually written off after 30 years"". ""Instead, they will simply receive a take-home pay cut of 4.7% and a shackle of a growing Â£50,000 debt. ""This makes absolutely no sense when there is a significant and growing national shortage throughout England of both nurses and midwives."" The way interest is levied is also under scrutiny. Estelle Clarke, a former City lawyer on the advisory board of the Intergenerational Foundation think tank, says student loans have less consumer finance protection than a basic product such as a credit card. She says if they were properly regulated, they would be unlikely to apply the monthly compound interest used for student loans. And if inflation goes up further - as is entirely possible - interest charges for students will also rise, adding to student loan debts that have already passed Â£100bn. This could become even more complicated, as the government is planning to sell off students' debts to private investors. So what will happen next? Any rowing back would mean taking a political hit and accusations of a U-turn. But sticking to the current plans would mean committing to a long upward curve in fees, which would be even more controversial by the next election. The Education Secretary Justine Greening says there needs to be a more honest debate about the cost of scrapping fees - both in financial terms to the public finances and in removing the funding for extra places. ""I'm someone who was the first person in my family to be able to go to university, and that matters to me a huge amount,"" says Ms Greening. ""I think the debate has revolved around what's the best way to enable access to our universities. ""We've seen a debate about whether that's no fees or no cap. ""When you bring a cap in, that means fewer students have a chance to go to university. ""We know that when there are fewer places at university, who gets them? ""We know that it's students who are doing better in our school system - and that tends to be students from better-off families. ""I really do feel that the Labour party should come clean to young people about the consequences of its no-fees policy. ""They should be frank with people that what they've said in the run-up to the election about effectively writing off student debt was a false promise.""

"Phil Redmond says ""a lot of Channel 4's DNA"" was created through Brookside and Hollyoaks, filmed in Liverpool The creator of Brookside, Phil Redmond, is leading a bid to bring Channel 4 to Liverpool, saying ""there could be no better home"". A government consultation isconsidering whether the broadcaster should moveout of central London. Mr Redmond said Liverpool was ""recognised as the UK's second cultural city"" and had always had a ""pool of creative talent"". The move could create more than 800 jobs, he added. Aconsultation into the broadcaster's future,externalwas launched after the government carried out an 18-month review of the publicly owned channel, which has more than 800 staff but fewer than 30 based outside the capital. Mr Redmond has joined Liverpool John Moores University, the city council and the Liverpool Film Office to try and bring the broadcaster to the city. He said: ""Apart from Liverpool's growing reputation as a cultural centre... we have to remember [that] a lot of Channel 4's DNA was created in this city through Brookside and then through Hollyoaks, which at one stage was providing 60% of Channel 4's income... "" He said Liverpool did not have a ""permanent broadcasting centre"" like other major cities, adding: ""We are talking about rebalancing the UK and rebalancing culture and rebalancing the news agenda outside of London. It seems like an obvious fix to come to Liverpool this time.""

Mr Redmond, who ran Mersey Television for 25 years, added: ""[There are] economic benefits obviously, if they bring Â£650-700m spend into the area - or the jobs attached to that- that is a big economic benefit. ""It would be fantastic for Liverpool but I also think it is the way to reinvigorate Channel 4 for its next 35 years."" Only 30 of Channel 4's staff are currently based outside London The West Midlands Combined Authoritylaunched a bid for the broadcaster to move to its regionlast week, with sites proposed in Birmingham, Coventry, Solihull and Dudley. Elsewhere, two Bradford MPs have called on Channel 4 to move its HQ to West Yorkshire.

"""I've had lots of brushes with death,"" said Mr Nadeau (left), ""but death keeps ignoring me"" No one likes a dull wedding, but one father-of-the-bride's speech was a little too electrifying at his daughter's ceremony last weekend.

""And just as I told my new son-in-law 'You're a lucky guy' - Boom!""he told the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation,external. Aside from a small scar on his thumb, Mr Nadeau says he was unscathed and the wedding proceeded. Storm clouds had gathered behind him at the ceremony on 8 July, he said, and his daughter saw lightning strike the ground nearby. ""I had the microphone and the shock jumped into the sound system and my hand just lit up and I saw the spark,"" he told the CBC. ""And I'm looking at my hand and it's all flared upâ¦ It was like I was holding a lightning bolt in my hand, it was amazing."" Everyone was stunned at first, but that didn't stop the happy couple from continuing with the festivities. ""It was a beautiful wedding,"" Mr Nadeau's wife, Maggy Thomas, told the CBC.

"This video can not be played David Davis defends 'repeal bill' plans The Scottish and Welsh governments have threatened to block the key Brexit bill which will convert all existing EU laws into UK law. The repeal bill,external, published earlier, is also facing opposition from Labour and other parties in the Commons. Ministers are ""optimistic"" about getting it through and have promised an ""ongoing intense dialogue"" with the devolved administrations. No 10 said it had to be passed or ""there will be no laws"" after Brexit. Brexit Secretary David Davis called it ""one of the most significant pieces of legislation that has ever passed through Parliament"". He rejected claims ministers were giving themselves ""sweeping powers"" to make changes to laws as they are repatriated. It will be up to MPs if they want a say on the ""technical changes"" ministers plan to make to legislation, he told the BBC. What is the Repeal Bill all about? Brexit: All you need to to know EU stands firm on citizen rights UK could be 'associate' of EU nuclear body Labour says it will not support the bill in its current form and is demanding concessions in six areas, including the incorporation of the European Charter of Fundamental Rights into British law. The party wants guarantees workers' rights will be protected and also want curbs on the power of government ministers to alter legislation without full parliamentary scrutiny. Leader Jeremy Corbyn, who was in Brussels earlier for a meeting with the EU's chief negotiator Michel Barnier, said: ""Far too much of it seems to be a process where the government... will be able to bypass Parliament. ""We will make sure there is full parliamentary scrutiny. We have a Parliament where the government doesn't have a majority, we have a country which voted in two ways on Leave or Remain. ""The majority voted to leave and we respect that, but they didn't vote to lose jobs and they didn't vote to have Parliament ridden roughshod over."" Formally known as the European Union (Withdrawal) Bill, the draft legislation is a key plank of the government's Brexit strategy The first line of the bill says the European Communities Act 1972, which took Britain into the EU, will be ""repealed on exit day"" This will end the supremacy of EU law and stop the flow of new regulations from Brussels But all existing laws derived from the EU will continue to be in force - they can be changed or scrapped by further legislation The bill does not detail policies line-by-line but transfers all regulations into domestic law It gives the UK two years after Brexit to correct any ""deficiencies"" arising from the transfer The Conservatives are relying on Democratic Unionist Party support to win key votes after losing their Commons majority in the general election, but could face a revolt from Remain supporting backbenchers. BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg said there could be ""parliamentary guerrilla warfare"" on the bill, as opposition parties and ""Remainer Tories"" try to ""put their version of Brexit, not Theresa May's, on to the statute book"". The repeal bill is not expected to be debated by MPs until the Autumn, but will need to have been passed by the time the UK leaves the EU - which is due to happen in March 2019. But the Scottish and Welsh governments have to give ""legislative consent"" to the bill before it can become law - something they have said they are not willing to do.

"Architect Peter Deakins was horrified to see the burnt remains of Grenfell Tower. Peter Deakins drew up the master plan for the Grenfell estate in the mid 1960s, a scheme that was hailed at the time as a ""spectacular surprise"" by the Architects' Journal because of its scale and ambition. He was horrified to see its centrepiece, the tower, burnt out. ""I really can't get to grips with it,"" he told me. ""It's too terrible to think about. And compared to all the high hopes when we started doing it all... it's just too horrible."" When plans were drawn up, more than 50 years ago, he said the area had been very rundown - the houses overcrowded, the gardens just mud, very often full of mattresses, no trees to be seen or planting. ""It was Steptoe and Son territory,"" he recalled. ""Some of it was actually filmed round here."" The aim of the scheme was to build better homes. Much of the housing was low-rise, but he says it was thought logical to include a tower block, with shops and offices on a lower deck. As it would have lifts, the Ministry of Housing would contribute to the cost. Messages from the tower 255 survived Grenfell blaze, Met says Grenfell Tower fire: Who were the victims? Reality Check: The Grenfell rehousing promise Although Peter Deakins was not the designer of the individual buildings on the Lancaster West estate - which includes Grenfell Tower - he worked on the estate as a whole and as an architect on many others, including the now-listed Golden Lane council estate and the Barbican. An early conception of the Lancaster West site, where Grenfell Tower is situated In those days, he says, the process was more closely overseen, which may help explain why the tower is still standing, despite the fierce fire that raged through it. ""It's a very solid building underneath, and would stand up to pretty well anything, I would think. ""The way buildings were detailed, there was so much control, there were so many fire officers involved, and building regulations under the London Building Acts - it was far more strict."" Today many contracts are so-called ""design and build"". The architects will draw up the design, but hand over to the builder or developer once the project has been approved by the local authority planners. Contractors will often take over the detailed design, meaning they will be responsible for compliance with regulations, and they will have a building control officer, who can either be employed by the local authority or work independently. Contractors are responsible for assessing fire risk, instead of the old system where the local authority would inspect and provide a fire certificate. The Royal Institute of British Architects (Riba) has highlighted the potential risk of this approach, and has also raised concerns about the virtual disappearance of the ""site architect"", who used to oversee the construction, and the ""clerk of works"" who would be based on the building site and check the work done. At the time Grenfell Tower was built, Peter Deakins recalls, the job of site architect was often extremely hard work. ""The architect in those days was chairman at site meetings and totally responsible for everything that happened,"" he explains. Building sites can be dangerous places: he knew of one architect killed in an accident. But he does believe that architects should once again play a more central role and see the whole process through. Looking up at the tower, its concrete skeleton visible beneath the blackened, blistered remnants of the cladding and insulation, Peter Deakins mused that it might be strong enough to be restored. But he paused, acknowledging that many people would much rather it came down. ""I wouldn't agree with people who say that all towers should come down. It's a bit like saying blue is better than green. But in this case, you just have to look at it. It's horrific.""

"Twelve-year-old Luana Gomes, on the right, was diagnosed with cyanide poisoning At least one survivor of the Grenfell Tower fire was diagnosed with cyanide poisoning, BBC Newsnight has learned. Medical discharge papers show 12-year-old Luana Gomes was treated for the effects of the highly toxic gas, which may have been released by burning of insulation or plastics during the fire. Her sister and mother were also treated for risk of cyanide poisoning. Mrs Gomes was seven months pregnant at the time of the blaze. Her unborn baby died after the fire. It has previously been reported that three Grenfell survivors were treated with a cyanide antidote but this is the first confirmation of a cyanide poisoning diagnosis. Andreia Gomes and her daughters were placed in medically induced comas when they were admitted to Kings College Hospital. Mrs Gomes was unconscious for four days, Luana for six days and her sister Megan was kept in a coma for a week. Luana's discharge record states that she was diagnosed with ""smoke inhalation injury"" and ""cyanide poisoning"". It also records that she received two doses of hydroxycobalamine ""for cyanide poisoning"". All three women were treated with a cyanide antidote though only Luana was diagnosed as having been poisoned. The BBC's environment correspondent Roger Harrabin said cyanide poisoning is relatively common following house fires as it is used in the manufacture of many plastics and is released when those plastics are burned. ""It sounds dramatic because cyanide is known in popular culture as the poisoner's weapon,"" he said. ""But cyanides are also produced by some bacteria, fungi and algae."" Cyanide also occurs naturally in some seeds and fruit stones, eg those of apricots, apples and peaches. Victims of cyanide are effectively choked by the toxic gas. Symptoms include headaches, dizziness, confusion, vomiting and convulsions. At high concentrations it can cause rapid death. ""The effects are really quick... you could die within seconds depending on the level of exposure,"" says clinical toxicologist and emergency medicine and critical care consultant Dr Johann Grundlingh. ""When you breathe in oxygen normally, your cells produce energy. Cyanide blocks your capability to produce energy from oxygen."" This video can not be played Marcio and Andreia Gomes tell the story of how they managed to escape the fire Mrs Gomes feels deep anger towards whoever was responsible for deciding to place cheaper, less fire retardant cladding on Grenfell Tower. ""You just killed my son,"" she said. ""If it was in a normal situation, I could have gone out. And he was seven months. He could have survived... But because of the conditions, he passed away."" Her husband Marcio Gomes told BBC Newsnight he decided to make a run for it with his family at around 04:00 when flames began to engulf his bedroom in their 21st floor flat. He described how he and his family had to step over a number of bodies as they groped their way, gasping for breath, down the smoke-filled staircase. ""What I didn't account for was the amount of bodies we had to trip over or step on. We were stepping on people's arms or legs."" The family was taken together to Kings College Hospital. Only Mr Gomes, who was also treated for smoke inhalation, remained conscious. He said he realised, even though he was not told explicitly, that their unborn child, who the couple had already named Logan, had died. ""Andreia didn't know what was going on because she was in an induced coma. My daughters were all in intensive care in induced comas as well. ""I knew something was wrong straight away when they told me in these scenarios they take the mother as a priority. So I broke down, because I knew what they were saying, without saying it. Then later on, they said the baby had passed away."" It is not known what produced cyanide in the Grenfell fire. It may, however, be related to the foam insulation installed on the exterior of the tower, which is known to produce the gas when burned. The cladding system added to Grenfell Tower in a recent Â£10m refurbishment has been the subject of scrutiny and speculation since itemerged that its outer layer was a less fire retardant product containing plastic between layers of aluminium. The aluminium and plastic panels covered a layer of foam insulation installed to improve the building's energy efficiency. This video can not be played Andreia Gomes was seven months pregnant at the time of the Grenfell Tower - she lost her baby ""Plastic foam insulation is effectively made from crude oil and so it's going to combust in more or less the same way as any other petrochemical,"" says Richard Hull, Professor of chemistry and fire science at the University of Central Lancashire. ""It's got a lot of nitrogen in it and therefore when it burns it produces both carbon monoxide and hydrogen cyanide."" A spokesman for the British Rigid Urethane Foam Manufacturer's Association (BRUFMA) - the trade body which represents makers of insulation of the kind used at Grenfell Tower - said no assumptions should be made about what materials created toxic gases in the fire. ""Gases given off by any burning material are toxic. The greatest toxic hazard in almost all fires is due to carbon monoxide,"" he said, ""There is no evidence to suggest that PIR (rigid polyisocyanurate) presents any special hazard in terms of toxicity. ""In tests on buildings with PIR panels, carried out by the UK Fire Research Station, no additional hazard from smoke or toxic gases was noted compared to those due to the burning of other buildings.""

"Akbar Al Baker boasted that the average age of his company's cabin crew was ""only 26"" The chief executive of Qatar Airways has apologised for comments he made about flight attendants that were condemned as both sexist and ageist. In aspeech,externalat a dinner in Ireland last week, Akbar Al Baker said US airlines were ""crap"" and their passengers were ""always being served by grandmothers"". He also boasted that ""the average age of my cabin crew is only 26"". On Wednesday, Mr Al Baker said the ""careless"" remarks did not reflect his ""true sentiments about cabin crew"". ""Competition among air carriers is robust. This is healthy, especially for our passengers, but our competition must remain respectful,"" he wrote in aletter,externalto the Association of Flight Attendants (AFA), a US trade union that has some 50,000 members from 20 airlines. ""For the cabin crew serving aboard all air carriers, professionalism, skill and dedication are the qualities that matter. I was wrong to imply that other factors, like age, are relevant,"" he added. The AFA's president, Sara Nelson,said,externalshe accepted the apology. Qatar Airways sees US laptop ban lifted Qatar wants 10% of American Airlines Saudi revokes Qatar Airways' licence On Monday, after a video of Mr Al Baker's speech was posted online, Ms Nelsonaccused,externalhim of confirming ""what AFA has said all along: Qatar Airways thrives on misogyny and discrimination. ""Qatar is not only seeking to choke out US aviation, but also the 300,000 good jobs built through opportunity created on the principle of equality."" She added: ""When there's an emergency on board, a flight attendant's gender, age, weight, height, race or sexuality simply do not matter. What matters is effective safety and security training, along with experience on the job."" Qatar Airways plans to buy a 10% stake in American Airlines The vice-president of flight service for American Airlines, Jill Surdek, also said in a message to employees that Mr Al Baker's remarks were ""incredibly offensive"". The controversy comes amid a row between US carriers and Qatar Airways, Etihad Airways and Emirates Airlineâ over alleged state support for them. On Wednesday, American Airlines announced that it was cancelling a code-share agreement with Qatar Airways and Etihad Airways as ""an extension of our stance against the illegal subsidies"". The airlines deny receiving state subsidies. Mr Al Baker said he was disappointed with the decision on Thursday, but that he would proceed with plans to buy a 10% stake in American Airlines. ""Our stock purchase request and filing is going ahead as normal. We had to clarify certain questions of the regulator, which we compiled with,"" he told reporters. Qatar Airways already owns a 20% stake in the owner of British Airways, International Airlines Group, and 10% of South America's LATAM Airlines.

"This video can not be played David Davis defends 'repeal bill' plans The Scottish and Welsh governments have threatened to block the key Brexit bill which will convert all existing EU laws into UK law. The repeal bill,external, published earlier, is also facing opposition from Labour and other parties in the Commons. Ministers are ""optimistic"" about getting it through and have promised an ""ongoing intense dialogue"" with the devolved administrations. No 10 said it had to be passed or ""there will be no laws"" after Brexit. Brexit Secretary David Davis called it ""one of the most significant pieces of legislation that has ever passed through Parliament"". He rejected claims ministers were giving themselves ""sweeping powers"" to make changes to laws as they are repatriated. It will be up to MPs if they want a say on the ""technical changes"" ministers plan to make to legislation, he told the BBC. What is the Repeal Bill all about? Brexit: All you need to to know EU stands firm on citizen rights UK could be 'associate' of EU nuclear body Labour says it will not support the bill in its current form and is demanding concessions in six areas, including the incorporation of the European Charter of Fundamental Rights into British law. The party wants guarantees workers' rights will be protected and also want curbs on the power of government ministers to alter legislation without full parliamentary scrutiny. Leader Jeremy Corbyn, who was in Brussels earlier for a meeting with the EU's chief negotiator Michel Barnier, said: ""Far too much of it seems to be a process where the government... will be able to bypass Parliament. ""We will make sure there is full parliamentary scrutiny. We have a Parliament where the government doesn't have a majority, we have a country which voted in two ways on Leave or Remain. ""The majority voted to leave and we respect that, but they didn't vote to lose jobs and they didn't vote to have Parliament ridden roughshod over."" Formally known as the European Union (Withdrawal) Bill, the draft legislation is a key plank of the government's Brexit strategy The first line of the bill says the European Communities Act 1972, which took Britain into the EU, will be ""repealed on exit day"" This will end the supremacy of EU law and stop the flow of new regulations from Brussels But all existing laws derived from the EU will continue to be in force - they can be changed or scrapped by further legislation The bill does not detail policies line-by-line but transfers all regulations into domestic law It gives the UK two years after Brexit to correct any ""deficiencies"" arising from the transfer The Conservatives are relying on Democratic Unionist Party support to win key votes after losing their Commons majority in the general election, but could face a revolt from Remain supporting backbenchers. BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg said there could be ""parliamentary guerrilla warfare"" on the bill, as opposition parties and ""Remainer Tories"" try to ""put their version of Brexit, not Theresa May's, on to the statute book"". The repeal bill is not expected to be debated by MPs until the Autumn, but will need to have been passed by the time the UK leaves the EU - which is due to happen in March 2019. But the Scottish and Welsh governments have to give ""legislative consent"" to the bill before it can become law - something they have said they are not willing to do. In a joint statement, first ministers Nicola Sturgeon and Carwyn Jones, who also met Mr Barnier, described the bill as a ""naked power-grab"" by Westminster that undermined the principles of devolution. They say the bill returns powers from Brussels solely to the UK government and Parliament and ""imposes new restrictions"" on the Scottish Parliament and the Welsh Assembly. Jeremy Corbyn presented Michel Barnier with an Arsenal shirt Ministers at Holyrood will not be able to amend EU rules in devolved areas such as agriculture and fisheries after Brexit until the UK Parliament and Scottish government have reached an agreement on them. UK Scottish Secretary David Mundell claimed the repeal bill would result in a powers ""bonanza"" for Holyrood - a comment described as ""ludicrous"" by the SNP. Corbyn meets chief EU negotiator Sturgeon: EU repeal bill a 'power grab' Warning over post-Brexit customs system Publish Brexit nuclear advice, MPs say Does it matter if the UK leaves Euratom? Theresa May's official spokeswoman said the repeal bill was a ""hugely important piece of legislation"" because ""we need to have a functioning statute book on the day we leave the EU"". The spokesman said First Secretary of State Damian Green had contacted the devolved administrations in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland and the government was confident of gaining their consent. Asked if there was a contingency plan if he didn't win their backing, the prime minister's official spokesman said ""not that I'm aware of"". Lib Dem leader Tim Farron, whose party is seeking to join forces with Labour and Tory rebels, said he was ""putting the government on warning"", promising a tougher test than than it faced when passing legislation authorising the UK's departure from the EU. ""If you found the Article 50 Bill difficult, you should be under no illusion, this will be hell,"" he said. Steve Baker, a minister in the Department for Exiting the European Union, said the government was ""ready"" for a fight over the bill but would also to ""listen to Parliament"". Speaking to BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg, Mr Davies predicted the bill ""may get amendments here and there"", saying he was open to suggestions from other parties for things that should be included. ""If we've missed something and got something wrong, then we'll debate that in the House of Commons,"" he said. ""That's how this works."" Mr Davis also insisted contingency plans were being made in case the UK and the EU cannot agree a Brexit deal. ""We are planning for all options,"" he said. ""The ideal outcome... right through to it not working at all and not getting a negotiated outcome at all."" Asked why Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson had said the government had ""no plan"" for such a scenario, he said: ""That's possibly because it's my responsibility to plan for it.""

"Blazer was banned from all football activities for life in 2015 Disgraced US football official Chuck Blazer has died at the age of 72, his lawyers say. Blazer, who was banned from all football activities for life in 2015, had been suffering from cancer. In 2013 he pleaded guilty to bribery, money laundering and tax evasion but agreed to help investigators exposecorruption in Fifa. A larger-than-life character, he was ex-boss of Concacaf, North and Central American football's governing body. His information led to charges against 14 other current or former Fifa officials, and contributed tothe downfall of Sepp Blatter, the organisation's president. Chuck Blazer: The parrot collector turned Fifa snitch ""We are truly saddened by the passing of our client and friend, Chuck Blazer,"" his lawyers said in a statement. ""His misconduct, for which he accepted full responsibility, should not obscure Chuck's positive impact on international soccer."" The official served on Fifa's executive committee from 1997-2013, during which time he pocketed millions to fund a globe-trotting VIP lifestyle. A 2013 report by Concacaf's integrity committee said he had received more than $20.6m (Â£16m) in commissions, fees and rental payments from the organisation between 1996 and 2011. His personal excesses included two apartments in New York's Trump Tower, one of which was exclusively for his cats. Mr Blazer's information helped secure the downfall of former FIFA president Sepp Blatter (C) By Richard Conway, BBC Sports News correspondent Chuck Blazer leaves behind a complex legacy to football. He helped develop the game in the US and then across his confederation. But he also personally enriched himself and was emblematic of the greed and corruption that festered within world football for many years. However, it was his evidence that was instrumental in the arrest and prosecution of scores of Fifa and marketing executives, a process that became publicly known with dramatic dawn raids in Zurich in 2015 and is still continuing. In his blogTravels with Chuck Blazer and his Friends...,external, he was pictured enjoying time with football legends like Pele and Bobby Charlton, and other high-profile names like Prince William and Hillary Clinton. He alsointroduced readers to his pet parrot,external, a blue-and-gold macaw named Max Blazer, even uploading a video of the bird dancing on the basket of his mobility scooter in New York's Central Park. His luck ran out when he tried to conceal his income after failing to file tax returns from 2005 to 2010. According to one account, Mr Blazer was arrested by the FBI and an Internal Revenue Service official in 2011 as he rode his scooter to a favourite New York restaurant. ""We can take you away in handcuffs now, or you can co-operate,"" he was reportedly told. Mr Blazer made his choice, and agreed to become an informant to help the US government expose corruption in football.

"Surgeons attached Zac Mitchell's big toe to his hand An Australian cattle worker whose thumb was severed by a bull has had his toe surgically transplanted in its position. Zac Mitchell, 20, was injured in April while working on a remote farming property in Western Australia. ""A bull kicked my hand into the fence,"" Mr Mitchell said of the incident. He underwent two unsuccessful operations to reattach his thumb before doctors opted to relocate his big toe in surgery lasting eight hours. Mr Mitchell said fellow workers had attempted to preserve his thumb immediately after the accident. ""They put it in the esky [cooler] with some ice,"" he told the BBC. Mr Mitchell was flown to hospital in the state capital of Perth, but efforts to save his thumb ultimately failed. Despite initial reluctance, the cattle worker agreed to the transplant operation at the Sydney Eye Hospital two weeks ago. An X-ray showing Mr Mitchell's thumb injury Lead plastic surgeon Dr Sean Nicklin said he was not surprised it took time to accept. ""It is a bit of a crazy idea - they [patients] do not want to be injured in another part of their body,"" he said. ""[However] even if you have got four good fingers, if you do not have something to pinch against them, your hand has lost a huge amount of its function."" Mr Mitchell will need more than 12 months of rehabilitation, but he plans to return to farm work. The Sydney Eye Hospital said it was rare to transplant a complete toe, like in Mr Mitchell's case, although partial toe relocations were more common. ""A lot of people think their balance and walking is going to be significantly affected which it generally isn't,"" Dr Nicklin said. Mr Mitchell's mum, Karen, said he was making a good recovery. ""Two weeks since the operation his walking is almost back to normal."" Doctors say Mr Mitchell should eventually be able to return to his hobby of bull riding.

Theresa May's official spokeswoman said the repeal bill was a ""hugely important piece of legislation"" because ""we need to have a functioning statute book on the day we leave the EU"". The spokesman said First Secretary of State Damian Green had contacted the devolved administrations in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland and the government was confident of gaining their consent. Asked if there was a contingency plan if he didn't win their backing, the prime minister's official spokesman said ""not that I'm aware of"". Lib Dem leader Tim Farron, whose party is seeking to join forces with Labour and Tory rebels, said he was ""putting the government on warning"", promising a tougher test than than it faced when passing legislation authorising the UK's departure from the EU. ""If you found the Article 50 Bill difficult, you should be under no illusion, this will be hell,"" he said. Steve Baker, a minister in the Department for Exiting the European Union, said the government was ""ready"" for a fight over the bill but would also to ""listen to Parliament"". Speaking to BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg, Mr Davies predicted the bill ""may get amendments here and there"", saying he was open to suggestions from other parties for things that should be included. ""If we've missed something and got something wrong, then we'll debate that in the House of Commons,"" he said. ""That's how this works."" Mr Davis also insisted contingency plans were being made in case the UK and the EU cannot agree a Brexit deal. ""We are planning for all options,"" he said. ""The ideal outcome... right through to it not working at all and not getting a negotiated outcome at all."" Asked why Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson had said the government had ""no plan"" for such a scenario, he said: ""That's possibly because it's my responsibility to plan for it.""

"This video can not be played Putin would prefer Clinton, President Trump tells the Christian Broadcasting Network President Donald Trump says the mood in the White House is ""fantastic"" despite intense scrutiny of his campaign's alleged dealings with Russia. He told Reuters the administration was ""functioning beautifully"". The president also defended his son, who it has emerged met a Russian lawyer during the election campaign. US media describe the White House as being in chaos over the story, with a Trump ally calling it a ""Category 5 hurricane"",the Washington Post,externalsaid. Donald Trump Jr met Natalia Veselnitskaya believing she had information that would damage his father's opponent Hillary Clinton. Mr Trump Jr told Fox News the meeting was ""such a nothing"", and ""a wasted 20 minutes"", but accepted he should have handled it differently. Critics say he may have broken federal laws. Senate Judiciary Committee chairman Chuck Grassley has said he he is asking Mr Trump Jr to testify and will subpoena him if necessary. Unanswered questions for Trump Jr Did the meeting break the law? US intelligence believe Moscow tried to sway the 2016 election in Mr Trump's favour and there are ongoing investigations into potential links between Mr Trump's campaign team and Russia. Moscow has repeatedly denied the claims. President Trump's latest comments come at the start of his two-day trip to France. He is meeting French counterpart Emmanuel Macron ahead ofBastille Day on Friday, and celebrations will also commemorate the entry 100 years ago of US troops into World War One. Donald Trump and wife Melania will be guests of honour at France's Bastille Day festivities Despite early tensions over climate change and trade, President Macron has made more of an effort recently to woo Mr Trump in a bid to boost France's influence on the world stage, says the BBC's Lucy Williamson in Paris. Will Macron make ties great again? Has Trump changed his mind about Paris? Before he left Washington on Wednesday, President Trump sought to dispel media reports saying his administration was in crisis over alleged collusion between his campaign team and Russia, telling Reuters it was ""a hoax made up by the Democrats"". He has previously suggested other agentsmay have meddled in the election, despite senior officials in his own administration blaming Russia. Mr Trump said he had not been aware of his son's meeting with Ms Veselnitskaya until a couple of days ago. Defending Donald Jr's decision to attend, he added: ""Many people, and many political pros, said everybody would do that."" The president described the election campaign as ""a wild time"" when ""we would meet with many people"". He refused to say that he regretted Donald Jr's actions, commenting: ""Most of the phony politicians who are Democrats who I watched over the last couple of days... would have taken that meeting in a heartbeat.""

This video can not be played ""Less tweeting, more doing"" - views from Trump heartland in Nebraska His comments came days after his much-anticipated meeting with Mr Putin at the G20 summit in Hamburg. ""People said, oh, they shouldn't get along. Well, who are the people saying that? I think we get along very, very well,"" he said. Comparing Trump and Putin Timeline of Trump-Russia scandal Russian cloud hangs over White House Mr Trump cited the recent ceasefire in south-western Syria as an example of how co-operation with Mr Putin worked. He said he was sure the Russians would have preferred to have Democrat Hillary Clinton in the White House. Why? ""If Hillary had won, our military would be decimated,"" he said. ""Our energy would be much more expensive. That's what Putin doesn't like about me. And that's why I say, why would he want me?"" He told Reuters he had asked Mr Putin flat-out if his government meddled in the US election. ""I said, 'Did you do it?' He said, 'No, I did not, absolutely not.' I then asked him a second time, in a totally different way. He said, 'Absolutely not.'"" ""Somebody did say, if he did do it, you wouldn't have found out about it.

"The maker of Havaianas - perhaps the world's most famous brand of flip-flops - has been sold for $1.1bn ($850m). The Brazilian label has been highly successful at home and internationally, with about 200 million pairs of the footwear sold every year. Alpargatas, the firm behind the brand, was owned by the scandal-hit J&F group, which manages the fortune of the billionaire Batista family. It is being bought by three prominent Brazilian banking groups. The sale of Sao Paulo-based Alpargatas was widely expected, and is part of J&F's strategy to offload businesses after it was involved in a series of corruption scandals. It is understood proceeds from the sale - to Cambuhy Investimentos, ItaÃºsa Investimentos and the fund Brasil Warrant - will help repay debt and go towards fines of more than $3bn the company has been hit with. Flip-flops are known as thongs in Australia, jandals in New Zealand, slops in South Africa and slippers in parts of Asia. But in Brazil - and elsewhere - they are commonly referred to by the brand name Havaianas. Famed for their colourful designs and association with the Brazilian beach-lifestyle, the company has also benefitted from celebrity association.

"The skeleton has been given a diving pose - as if it is feeding on a ball of krill London's Natural History Museum (NHM) has undergone a major revamp with a blue whale skeleton now forming the main exhibit as visitors come through the front door. The marine mammal replaces the much-loved Diplodocus dinosaur, ""Dippy"", which will soon head out on a tour of the UK. The museum believes the change will give its image a refresh. It wants to be known more for its living science than its old fossils. The museum employs hundreds of researchers who engage in active study on a day-to-day basis. Yes, they use the 80 million-odd specimens kept at the South Kensington institution, but their focus is on learning new things that bear down on the modern world. In that sense, the blue whale is regarded as the perfect emblem. The specimen is being given the name ""Hope"" as a ""symbol of humanity's power to shape a sustainable future"". Blue whales are now making a recovery following decades of exploitation that nearly drove them out of existence. The exhibits that will support the blue whale How the whale was prepared for display Whaling's 'uncomfortable' scientific legacy Whales reached huge size only recently The Natural History Museum is closed to the public all day Thursday for final preparations This video can not be played BBC Horizon: Richard Sabin tags blue whales with John Calambokidis Staff have spent months preparing the 126-year-old skeleton for its new role. First, it had to be removed from its old hanging space in the mammals gallery. Then it had to be cleaned and in a few places repaired and strengthened. And finally, it had to be re-hung from the iron girders that support the ceiling in the Waterhouse building's spectacular Hintze Hall. The BBC was given exclusive access to the whole process, anda Horizon documentary, narrated by Sir David Attenborough, will go out on BBC Two at 21:00 BST on Thursday. The film will air at about the same time as the NHM's patron, the Duchess of Cambridge, and Sir David, inaugurate the new exhibit at a gala reception. The young female blue whale beached on Wexford sands on 25 March 1891 Skeleton is just over 25m long and weighs 3 tonnes At death, the animal was about 10-15 years old NHM bought the skeleton for Â£250 from a middleman He sold the oil for fuel; meat went to the pet trade Arrived at museum in March 1892 and put in storage First went on display in 1938 in the mammals gallery A great many people were involved in the make-over, but the promotion of the whale represents something of a personal triumph for Richard Sabin, the museum's principal curator of mammals. He championed the change and suggested the dynamic lunge-feeding pose that the whale now assumes. It was on a visit to the NHM in 1976, as a boy of 10, that Richard first saw the skeleton in its old display position. He describes that experience as transformative. ""I was absolutely blown away,"" he told BBC News. ""I remember running up the stairs to the balcony and asking an attendant if the whale skeletons in the gallery were real. And she said 'yes, and not only that you can still see these animals in the ocean today'. ""I got home and the very next day I headed down to the public library to try to find as many books as I could on whales. It was, to coin a phase, a defining moment."" Biggest animal ever to have lived on Planet Earth Weighs up to 200 tonnes, and can be up to 30m long Hunts in all oceans, ranging from tropics to poles Must eat over 4 tonnes of shrimp-like krill a day Jaws open to over 90 degrees to take giant gulps Commercial whalers reduced numbers to a few hundred Species has rebounded to perhaps 20,000 individuals For the Horizon film, Richard can be seen tracing the history of the specimen - meeting the descendants of the Irish fisherman who despatched the animal with a makeshift harpoon after it had beached off County Wexford in March 1891. But he also travels to North America, to the Pacific Coast, to join the Cascadia Research Group as they track migrating blue whales. The group, co-founded by John Calambokidis, attaches tags to the giant creatures. Held on by suction cups, these devices record the behaviour of the whales, even capturing 4K video as they dive underwater. The team is learning key facts that will help conserve the majestic animals, which went to the brink of oblivion thanks to 20th Century hunters. ""We've discovered that blue whales spend twice as much time at the surface at night than they do in the day,"" John told Horizon. ""That's the period when they're most vulnerable to ship strikes. That identified right there that we need to be most concerned about ships and their transiting through blue whale areas at night rather than the day."" This video can not be played A timelapse movie captures the erection of the blue whale Whale flipper: The Wexford specimen got an MOT before being re-hung For Richard, the observation of whales in the Pacific confirmed his desire to see the conservation icon put centre-stage at his museum back in London. ""It's been an honour and a privilege to work with the specimen that inspired me all those years ago - to breathe new life into it; to inject science from the field into it; to display it in a much more meaningful way. ""I honestly believe it will take people's breath away when they see it. ""Thursday is going to be an amazing day for everyone involved; I am sure there will be plaudits for what we've done. But I can't wait for Friday morning when the first families, the first schoolchildren, walk through the door and I get to hear what they've got to say about what they see."" Fans of Dippy should not despair. After the dinosaur's two-year tour of Britain, it will return to a make-over of its own. The skeleton, which is actually only a plaster cast, will be fashioned again in bronze and placed in the east garden in front of the museum. You can watch a trail forHorizon: Dippy and the Whale. After broadcast on BBC Two, the programme will be available on the iPlayer.

"Blazer was banned from all football activities for life in 2015 Disgraced US football official Chuck Blazer has died at the age of 72, his lawyers say. Blazer, who was banned from all football activities for life in 2015, had been suffering from cancer. In 2013 he pleaded guilty to bribery, money laundering and tax evasion but agreed to help investigators exposecorruption in Fifa. A larger-than-life character, he was ex-boss of Concacaf, North and Central American football's governing body. His information led to charges against 14 other current or former Fifa officials, and contributed tothe downfall of Sepp Blatter, the organisation's president. Chuck Blazer: The parrot collector turned Fifa snitch ""We are truly saddened by the passing of our client and friend, Chuck Blazer,"" his lawyers said in a statement. ""His misconduct, for which he accepted full responsibility, should not obscure Chuck's positive impact on international soccer."" The official served on Fifa's executive committee from 1997-2013, during which time he pocketed millions to fund a globe-trotting VIP lifestyle. A 2013 report by Concacaf's integrity committee said he had received more than $20.6m (Â£16m) in commissions, fees and rental payments from the organisation between 1996 and 2011. His personal excesses included two apartments in New York's Trump Tower, one of which was exclusively for his cats. Mr Blazer's information helped secure the downfall of former FIFA president Sepp Blatter (C) By Richard Conway, BBC Sports News correspondent Chuck Blazer leaves behind a complex legacy to football. He helped develop the game in the US and then across his confederation. But he also personally enriched himself and was emblematic of the greed and corruption that festered within world football for many years. However, it was his evidence that was instrumental in the arrest and prosecution of scores of Fifa and marketing executives, a process that became publicly known with dramatic dawn raids in Zurich in 2015 and is still continuing. In his blogTravels with Chuck Blazer and his Friends...,external, he was pictured enjoying time with football legends like Pele and Bobby Charlton, and other high-profile names like Prince William and Hillary Clinton. He alsointroduced readers to his pet parrot,external, a blue-and-gold macaw named Max Blazer, even uploading a video of the bird dancing on the basket of his mobility scooter in New York's Central Park. His luck ran out when he tried to conceal his income after failing to file tax returns from 2005 to 2010. According to one account, Mr Blazer was arrested by the FBI and an Internal Revenue Service official in 2011 as he rode his scooter to a favourite New York restaurant. ""We can take you away in handcuffs now, or you can co-operate,"" he was reportedly told. Mr Blazer made his choice, and agreed to become an informant to help the US government expose corruption in football.

"This video can not be played Fire crews battled the flames in the country's south Around 700 tourists have been rescued by boat from wildfires in Sicily, as swathes of southern Italy battle blazes. As flames neared the seaside resort of Calampiso, fishermen and boat-owners were drafted in to aid the evacuation. Matteo Rizzo, the mayor of nearby San Vito Lo Capo, appealed for help from ""anyone with safe and reliable boats"". Writing on Facebook, he called the situation at the village west of Palermo ""very urgent"". Evacuees were taken to schools in San Vito, and the mayor urged his ""friendly and generous"" town to pull together. ""We need minibuses and cars to pick people up at the little port and take them to school buildings,"" he said. ""Let's all do something."" The view from Naples as smoke billows from fires around Mount Vesuvius There are no reports of injuries caused by the Calampiso fire, but witnesses described running to the beach as their accommodation burned. Italian paper La Stampa quoted one evacuated tourist,external, Stella Belliotti, as saying: ""We fled in swimwear and slippers. Our apartment was engulfed in flames. They were right above us. I took my daughter and I went to the beach. They made us go on the boats that go around Zingaro. First women and children, and then the others."" Temperatures in Italy's arid south have reached over 40C (104F) after months of little rainfall. Images from the slopes of Mount Vesuvius, in the southern region of Campania, show clouds of smoke over a kilometre high pouring into the air near Naples. The national fire service said it was engaged in 441 operations across Italy on Wednesday, including 288 wildfires. Those at Vesuvius are among the most serious. Around 70 firefighters have tackled the huge fire on the ground, alongside Civil Protection volunteers, and three helicopters have been deployed. Environment Minister Gian Luca Galletti said a man had been arrested on suspicion of arson in the area. ""If someone set fire to Vesuvius, I want to see them in jail for 15 years,"" Italian media quoted him as saying. Calampiso was safely evacuated, with around 700 tourists rescued by sea The minister said a decision would be made shortly about whether to send the army to assist the stricken areas. The World Wildlife Fund has warned that thousands of people, animals, and a nature reserve are at risk around the volcano. Italy's government declared a state of emergency last week in response to the drought in the northern provinces of Parma and Piacenza, and opposition politicians are demanding the same for the wildfires.

"This video can not be played ""We will end the supremacy of EU law"" - Davis It's crunch time for the government's EU Withdrawal Bill - the bill which aims to ensure European law will no longer apply in the UK after Brexit. This key plank of legislation, once known as the Great Repeal Bill, has reached committee stage in the House of Commons, which is the bit where there will be hundreds of attempts by MPs to change its wording. As its informal name suggests, therepeal bill,externalwill repeal the 1972 European Communities Act, which took Britain into the EU and meant that European law took precedence over laws passed in the UK Parliament. It will also end the power of the European Court of Justice in the UK. All existing EU legislation will be copied across into domestic UK law to ensure a smooth transition on the day after Brexit. The government says it wants to avoid a ""black hole in our statute book"" and avoid disruption to businesses and individual citizens as the UK leaves the EU. The UK Parliament can then ""amend, repeal and improve"" individual laws as necessary. Ensuring the continuity of EU rules and regulations is also meant to aid trade negotiations with the EU because the UK will already meet all of its product stands. The repeal bill will mean the UK is no longer bound by the European Court of Justice The bill is likely to be ""one of the largest legislative projects ever undertaken in the UK"", areport,externalby the House of Commons library predicts, with ""major swathes of the statute book"" needing to be examined to see how they will work after Brexit. This is because working out which bits of UK law came from the EU is not as simple as it may sound. In fact, it presents a ""unique challenge"", a House of Lords committee warned, because ""the body of EU law is found in a number of different places, and in a number of different forms"". Simply transposing all EU law into UK legislation will not be enough, the government'sWhite Paper,externalon the bill says. Swathes of UK law ""will no longer work"" on exit, for example because they refer to EU institutions. Not all of this can be done through the repeal bill, so the government plans to create powers to ""correct the statute book where necessary"" - without full Parliamentary scrutiny. This power - known as Henry VIII power - is the one of the most controversial features of the bill (see below). More complications are presented by the government's negotiations with the EU, which will be taking place while the bill is passing through Parliament. Those talks could shape what the UK's post-Brexit laws look like - but the repeal bill will need to be done and dusted by the day the UK leaves. The government is expected to use powers known as Henry VIII clauses The government plans to enact its ""corrections"" to the statute book using what are known as Henry VIII powers, after the Statute of Proclamations 1539 which gave him the power to legislate by proclamation. Given that this will not involve the usual Parliamentary scrutiny process, opposition parties have protested, with Labour claiming ministers were being handed ""sweeping powers"" to make hasty, ill thought-out legislation. Ministers have attempted to reassure critics by saying such measures will be time-limited and not used to make policy changes. In total, the government estimates that 800 to 1,000 measures called statutory instruments will be required to make sure the bill functions properly. The European Commission proposes new EU legislation A lot. The government's White Paper says there is ""no single figure"" for this, but that there are believed to be 12,000 EU regulations (one type of EU law) in force, while Parliament has passed 7,900 statutory instruments implementing EU legislation and 186 acts which incorporate a degree of EU influence. The total body of European law, dating back to 1958, is known as the Acquis Communautaire. It binds all member states and in 2010 was estimated to consist of about 80,000 items, covering everything from workers' rights to environment and trade. As well as regulations, this includes EU treaties, directions and European Court of Justice rulings. New EU legislation is being created all the time and will continue to apply to the UK until it leaves. Different types of EU legislation work in different ways, and will be treated differently by the bill. So regulations, which apply automatically in the UK, will be converted into UK law. But directives require a new UK law to come into force - this legislation will be preserved by the bill. Reality check: How much UK law comes from the EU? MPs have already voted to approve the second reading of the bill, by 326 votes to 290. But there are many hurdles ahead and on Tuesday the line-by-line scrutiny of how it will operate begins. As tends to happen with legislation deemed to be of constitutional importance, this 'committee stage' is taking place on the floor of the House of Commons, so all MPs can take part. Eight days have been allocated for this process, which will be followed by more stages including the bill's passage through the House of Lords. The plan is for it to be passed ahead of the UK's exit from the EU but to become law only when it actually leaves, in March 2019. Read more: A guide to the EU bill's journey through Parliament Labour, the SNP and the Lib Dems all opposed the bill at second reading, and MPs from all parties - with the exception of the DUP - are now trying to amend it at committee stage. Labour's suggested changes include trying to maintain a role for the European Court of Justice during the transition phase planned after March 2019. There is also a cross-party attempt to prevent the UK from leaving the EU without a deal in place. Until the UK actually leaves, EU law will continue to apply. But after leaving, the European Union (Withdrawal) Act (as it will be by then) comes into force. The government says having the legislation in place will ensure a ""calm and orderly exit"". Then begins the long-term process of the government, and Parliament, choosing what it wants to do with the laws it has incorporated from the EU. With so many pieces of legislation to be considered, this could turn out to be a ""major drain on resources"" and should not ""crowd out"" other government policies, the Institute for Government think tank has warned. The Scottish Parliament is likely to get a vote on the Great Repeal Bill Some of the EU laws are in areas that are controlled by the devolved administrations - so do they now become part of Westminster law, or will they be added to the statute book in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland? It is not entirely clear how this will work, although the government says it will work closely with the devolved administrations. It also predicts the repeal process will result in a ""a significant increase in the decision-making power of each devolved administration"", as powers in devolved areas are repatriated from Brussels. But the bill has been described by the Scottish government as an ""executive power grab"". Ministers have confirmed the devolved administrationswill be asked to consent to the bill- but this does not amount to a veto. The UK government has warned that blocking the bill could have ""very significant consequences"", leaving ""a hole in our law"".

"The law around wills should be updated and brought into the ""modern world"",the Law Commission for England and Wales,externalhas said. The current rules were ""unclear"" and could be putting people off from making a will, it added. It is considering whether texts, emails and other electronic communications should be recognised as a valid will in exceptional circumstances. The commissionhas launched a consultation on the proposals,external. Currently, for a will to be legally valid it must be voluntarily written by someone who is 18 or over and of sound mind and be signed in front of two witnesses who are also both over 18 and must also both sign the will in your presence. But the commission wants to change the existing formality rules where the will-maker has made clear their intentions in another form. It gives the example where a car crash victim has not made a formal will but has expressed their intentions in electronic or other messages, such as a text or email. The family could then apply to a court to have those communications recognised as a formal will. These messages could only then be recognised as a will if a judge approved. If someone dies without a will, rules dictate how their money, property or possessions should be allocated, and potentially not in the way the deceased would have wished Unmarried partners and partners who have not registered a civil partnership cannot inherit from each other unless there is a will If there are no surviving relatives who can inherit under the rules of intestacy, the estate passes to the Crown Specific rules can vary across the United Kingdom Source: Citizens Advice,external The Law Commission acknowledged the proposals on electronic communications could cause family arguments or worse. It said the plans could provide a ""treasure trove for dissatisfied relatives"" and lead to a ""variety of avenues by which probate could become both expensive and contentious"". But it said on balance it believed they should be recognised by the courts, noting that 40% of people currently die without making a will. Law Commissioner, Professor Nick Hopkins, said making a will should be ""straightforward"" but the law was ""unclear and outdated"". ""Even when it's obvious what someone wanted, if they haven't followed the strict rules, courts can't act on it. ""And conditions which affect decision-making - like dementia - aren't properly accounted for in the law. ""That's not right and we want an overhaul to bring the law into the modern world. ""Our provisional proposals will not only clarify things legally, but will also help to give greater effect to people's last wishes."" The consultation closes on 10 November.
