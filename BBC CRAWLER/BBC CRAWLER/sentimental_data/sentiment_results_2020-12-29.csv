"Boris Johnson signs the UK trade deal with the EU MPs have overwhelmingly approved the UK's post-Brexit trade deal with the EU in a parliamentary vote. A bill bringing the deal into UK law was backed by the Commons by 521 to 73 votes after Parliament was recalled. The majority of Labour MPs voted for the agreement after leader Sir Keir Starmer said a ""thin deal was better than no deal"". The UK will sever its ties with the EU at 23.00 GMT on Thursday, four and a half years after the Brexit referendum. The House of Lords also passed the bill, which will now receive Royal Assent. Prime Minister Boris Johnson thanked MPs and peers for passing the bill, adding: ""The destiny of this great country now resides firmly in our hands."" The agreement hammered out with Brussels over nine months sets out a new business and security relationship between the UK and its biggest trading partner. As it happened: MPs vote for trade deal law MSPs vote to 'refuse consent' for Brexit deal Labour aides quit over Starmer's Brexit stance TheEU (Future Relationship) Bill,externalis being rushed through Parliament in a single day and is set to become law late on Wednesday once it has received Royal Assent. This video can not be played Boris Johnson: We were continually told our vision for Brexit was impossible After five hours of debate in the Commons, it passed its two legislative hurdles by huge margins, thanks to Mr Johnson's large majority and the support of the Labour Party. It is now being considered by the Lords. Inan interview with the BBC's Laura Kuenssberg, the prime minister said the treaty would allow the UK to ""go our own way but also have free trade"" with the EU. He said: ""There will be changes. And we've been very clear with people that they have to get ready for 1 January, things will work differently. ""But from the point of view of UK exporters, for instance, they'll now have the advantage, that they'll only have one set of forms they have to fill out for export to around the whole world."" Offering his backing, Sir Keir - who campaigned against Brexit - told MPs he wanted to ""avoid a no deal and put in place a floor from which we can build a strong future relationship"". But he accused the prime minister of not being honest with the public about the deal, which he said would lead to an ""avalanche of checks, bureaucracy and red tape for British businesses"". This video can not be played Labour leader Keir Starmer indicated that he would vote in favour of the post-Brexit deal There was also a ""gaping hole"" in the agreement when it came to the service sector, which accounts for about 80% of the UK's economic output, said Sir Keir. ""The lack of ambition here is striking,"" he told MPs, saying there was a lack of mutual recognition of professional standards with the EU, which would make life more difficult for people who wanted to work abroad. One Labour MP Bell Ribeiro-Addy voted against the deal while 36 others also defied their leader's orders by either not voting at all or actively abstaining. Three of these - Helen Hayes, Florence Eshalomi and Tonia Antoniazzi - resigned their junior frontbench positions as a result. All other opposition parties, including the SNP, the Lib Dems, Plaid Cymru andall Northern Ireland partiesthat take seats at Westminster, also voted against the deal. A quick guide to what's in the Brexit deal Where do UK political parties stand on Brexit vote? Lib Dem leader Sir Ed Davey said the deal would ""undermine our children's future"", while the SNP's Ian Blackford said Scotland's fishing industry had been ""betrayed"" and the country's future ""must be European"". And Green Party MP Caroline Lucas said it would undermine hard-won environmental and consumer protections and leave the UK ""less equipped"" to respond to the climate emergency. Only two Tory MPs failed to support the deal - Brexiteers John Redwood and Owen Paterson abstaining. This video can not be played The moment MPs voted to back EU-UK Brexit trade deal Members of the European Research Group (ERG) who helped sink Theresa May's EU withdrawal deal in 2019, lined up to praise the deal. Sir Bill Cash said the PM had achieved the seemingly ""impossible"" while Sir Iain Duncan Smith said it represented a ""huge advance on where we might have been"". And Steve Brine, one of the 21 Tory MPs who lost the whip last year after defying the government over Brexit, said he would back a deal that left the UK ""culturally, emotionally, historically and strategically attached"" to Europe. ""We now have a new future to look forward to,"" he said. ""It won't be the same. We should never have pretended it will and that's OK. It is time to come together and to move on."" A Brexit deal has been agreed, days before a deadline.It means that the UK and the EU can continue to trade without extra taxes being put on goods. What took so long?The UK voted to leave the EU in 2016 and actually left on 31 January 2020, but leaders had until the end of 2020 to work out a trade deal. There are big changes ahead.Although it's a trade deal that has been agreed, there will also be changes to how people travel between the EU and UK, and to the way they live and work. In his Commons speech, Mr Johnson said the bill heralded a ""new relationship between Britain and the EU as sovereign equals, joined by friendship, commerce, history, interests and values, while respecting one another's freedom of action and recognising that we have nothing to fear if we sometimes choose to do things differently"". Mr Johnson's predecessor Theresa May told MPs she would vote for the deal ""in the national interest"" but was ""disappointed"" about aspects of it and warned against thinking the UK could ""excise the EU"" from its politics. ""Sovereignty does not mean isolationism, it does not mean we never accept somebody else's rules, it does not mean exceptionalism,"" she said. ""It is important as we go forward that we recognise we live in an interconnected world."" Mr Johnson has signed the international treaty ratifying the deal in Downing Street after it was flown across the Channel in an RAF plane. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and European Council President Charles Michel signed the document earlier in Brussels. The European Parliament has begun its scrutiny of the agreement but will not get a chance to ratify it before the UK leaves the EU single market and customs union at 2300 GMT on Thursday. The deal has, however, been given the unanimous backing of ambassadors from the 27 nations and the member states gave their written approval on Tuesday.

"Boris Johnson and Ursula von der Leyen are set to sign the deal on Wednesday The UK-EU post-Brexit trade deal will be signed in Brussels on Wednesday by EU chiefs - before being flown to London for Boris Johnson to sign. Downing Street said an RAF plane will transport the international treaty, accompanied by UK and EU officials. It will come a day before the UK severs ties with the 27 nation organisation. The UK Parliament is being recalled to vote on the agreement, which sets the rules for a new trade and security relationship between the UK and EU. The deal was agreed in Brussels on Christmas Eve, following nine months of negotiations. EU ambassadors approve post-Brexit trade deal Starmer faces revolt over backing for Brexit deal Brexit deal mentions Netscape's long-dead browser The European Parliament has begun its scrutiny of the agreement but will not get a chance to ratify it before the UK leaves the EU single market and customs union at midnight on Thursday. The deal has, however, been given the unanimous backing of ambassadors from the 27 nations and the member states gave their written approval earlier on Tuesday. That paves the way for European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and European Council President Charles Michel to sign the treaty on Wednesday morning in Brussels. It will then be flown across the Channel for the UK prime minister to sign it in Downing Street, a No 10 spokesman said. Both houses of the UK Parliament are set to vote on a bill putting the agreement into UK law on Wednesday. MPs are set to debate theEU (future relationship) Bill,externalfor five hours, starting at 09:30 GMT, before a vote. It is expected to clear the Commons with the backing of the opposition Labour Party, although some Labour MPs - and all the other opposition parties - are planning to vote against it or abstain. It will then move on to the Lords, which is also expected to back it, before receiving Royal Assent. The key points of the deal What does the deal mean for fishing? How your Europe holidays will change Prime Minister Boris Johnson hashailed the deal, which comes four and half years since the UK voted to leave the EU and a year after it officially left, as the first of its kind in history. The PM says it will deliver on his general election promise to ""take back control"" of the UK's laws, borders, money and fishing waters. And he claimed the Â£668bn a year agreement would ""protect jobs across this country"" and ""enable UK goods to be sold without tariffs, without quotas in the EU market"". Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer - who campaigned against Brexit - has described it as a ""thin"" deal which does not do enough to protect jobs, the environment and workers' rights. But he has ordered Labour MPs to back it as the only alternative was leaving without a deal, which he said would have been devastating for the UK economy. Northern Ireland's political parties that take their seats at Westminsterwill be voting against the deal- as will theScottish National Partyand Welsh nationalists Plaid Cymru. But the prime minister has received a boost from a powerful group of backbench Tory Brexiteers, who have indicated they will back the deal. The European Research Group (ERG) said its panel of legal experts had examined the text in detail and concluded that it ""preserves the UK's sovereignty as a matter of law"". It comes as the UK government announced it has signed a deal that will allow British businesses to continue trading with Turkey on the same terms after Brexit. The tariff-free arrangements underpin a trading relationship which the UK government said was worth Â£18.6bn last year. The government said both sides are ""committed to working towards a more ambitious free trade agreement"". The UK rolled over dozens of trade deals with countries around the world since deciding to leave the EU's trading arrangements. The vast majority of the 62 trade deals the UK has signed over the past two years have retained the same terms as before Brexit.

"This video can not be played Covid in Scotland: Nicola Sturgeon urges people to 'stay at home' this Hogmanay Scots have been urged to stay at home and not celebrate Hogmanay with other households as daily Covid-19 case numbers hit a record high. Another 1,895 cases were reported on Tuesday - the highest logged on a single day since mass testing began. The whole Scottish mainland is in thehighest level of restrictionsin a bid to contain a new strain of the virus. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said it was ""especially vital"" people did not mix indoors with other households. The near 2,000 cases reported on Tuesday was double the number logged on Monday, with 14.4% of tests returning a positive result. Ms Sturgeon said there had been ""quite a big jump in cases"", although there could be a ""Christmas lag"" in reporting some results. Covid in Scotland: Where are the latest cases? Shetland 'set for level 4' if Covid cases rise Confirmed Covid cases in Scotland pass 120,000 She said the new strain of Covid-19 was ""contributing to faster spread"" of the virus, with a rising trend across the country and particular concerns over Shetland and the south of Scotland. The first minister said: ""The main message to people is to make sure you are not visiting other people's houses just now. Unfortunately that includes Hogmanay and New Year. ""This is a time of year I know people enjoy getting together, but that's not safe to do this year. ""As we head into the Hogmanay and new year period I really do appeal to people to stay out of the homes of others, celebrate new year in your own home only with your own household."" A further seven deaths of patients who had tested positive for Covid-19 in the last 28 days were also reported on Tuesday, although registration offices were closed over the festive break and the publication of most figures has been delayed. As of Tuesday there were 1,092 people in hospital with a recently-confirmed case of the virus, with 65 in intensive care. The whole of mainland Scotland has been in level four - the top tier of measures - since Boxing Day, and will remain there for at least three weeks. Officials are also considering on a daily basis whether to escalate restrictions on Scotland's islands, which are currently in level three. Ms Sturgeon said the situation in Shetland in particular was being ""very clearly monitored"". She also said there were concerns about ""quite significant increases"" in cases in Dumfries and Galloway and the Borders. MSPs are to be given an update on the latest situation on Wednesday, when the Scottish Parliament is being recalled from recess to debate the Brexit deal.

"Queen's Hospital in Romford, Essex, said some Covid patients are being cared for in ambulances outside the hospital as London's NHS faces ""significant pressure"" A surge in coronavirus cases in the UK is of ""extreme concern"", a health boss says, as a record number of cases was reported for the second day running. On Tuesday, 53,135new Covid cases were recorded,externalas well as 414 more deaths within 28 days of a positive test. Not all data was reported in full over the Christmas period, leading to a lag in some data, but Public Health England said there had been a ""real increase"". The health secretary said the NHS was facing ""unprecedented pressures"". Ahead of an announcement on any changes to England's tier restrictions on Wednesday,Matt Hancock added in a tweet,external: ""We must suppress this virus to protect our NHS & save lives until the vaccine can keep us safe."" Hospitals in England and Wales are now treating more Covid patients than at the peak of the first wave in April. Hospital staff asked to cancel holidays What are the lockdown and tier four rules? New coronavirus variant: What do we know? Dr Susan Hopkins, senior medical adviser at PHE, said: ""We are continuing to see unprecedented levels of Covid-19 infection across the UK, which is of extreme concern, particularly as our hospitals are at their most vulnerable. ""Whilst the number of cases reported today include some from over the festive period, these figures are largely a reflection of a real increase."" Dr Hopkins said it was ""essential, now more than ever"" that people follow social distancing rules to help drive infections down and protect the NHS and vulnerable people. It comesa day after more than 40,000 daily virus cases were announced for the first timein the UK, although it is thought infection rates were higher earlier in the year, before mass testing. In Wales' Brecon Beacons beauty spot, police have had to turn awayvisitors from as far away as London- which is under ""stay at home"" tier four rules. People in Scotland have been urged to stay at homeand not celebrate Hogmanay with other households. And in Northern Ireland a top doctor has warneda third surge of Covid cases is expected in mid-January, in part driven by the spread of a new coronavirus variant. There is no shying away from these very big, record-breaking figures and the strain they put on the NHS. Many hospitals in the UK are already caring for more people with Covid than during the first wave and the situation looks set to get worse, not better - at least in the short term. New infections are rising rapidly, which will pile on even more pressure on busy wards in the coming weeks. Although much of the UK has introduced tougher Covid restrictions, it is not clear yet if they will be enough to help drive infections down, or at least hold them at manageable levels. There is a new variant of Covid that has been spreading more readily, which complicates things. And we are yet to see what the permitted (and banned) Christmas socialising will do to the figures. The NHS is coping and open for business, but medics fear it being tested to breaking point. A scientist advising the government has said ""decisive"" national action is needed to tackle the spread of the virus across the UK and prevent a ""catastrophe"" in the new year. Prof Andrew Hayward, a member of the government's New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group (Nervtag), said the new variant meant the UK was entering ""a very dangerous new phase of the pandemic"". He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the ""50% increase in transmissibility"" of the new variant means restrictions that worked before ""won't work now"" so England's tier four restrictions, ""or even higher than that"", were likely to be needed. ""I think we're really looking at a situation where we're moving into near lockdown,"" he added. Tier four - England's toughest level of coronavirus restrictions, currently in place in parts of east and south-east England - includes a ""stay at home"" order and the closure of non-essential shops. Prof Hayward, a professor of infectious disease epidemiology at University College London, said he thought schools would have to return ""maybe a little bit later"" but that having schools open would mean ""we're going to have to have increased, strict restrictions in other areas of society to pay for that"". The prime minister's official spokesman said the government was ""still planning for a staggered opening"" of secondary schools after Christmas but it was keeping this under constant review. Members of the armed forces will be on standbyto help roll out mass testing to secondary schools and colleges in England from next month. Another epidemiologist and member of Nervtag, Prof Neil Ferguson, said the new coronavirus variant had ""undoubtedly"" made the situation ""considerably more difficult"". He told BBC Radio 4's The World at One programme that it had given the government ""even less wiggle room"" in trying to keep control of the virus while maintaining ""some semblance of normal society"". Preliminary research released on Tuesday suggestedthe new variant of the virus was no more harmful in terms of causing hospitalisations and deaths.,external Researchers found no significant difference in terms of mortality or morbidity when they compared 1,769 people infected with the new variant versus 1,769 who had ""regular"" or ""wild type"" of Covid. Military offers remote support for pupil testing Covid hospital pressures 'incredibly challenging' NHS faces being 'overwhelmed' warn health leaders Hospitals in Wales, Scotland and the south of England have reported rising pressure on their services as the number of Covid patients increases, with health officials warning they are at risk of becoming overwhelmed. Southend University Hospital in Essexhas asked staff to cancel holidaysto help treat its high number of Covid patients. Emergency medicine consultant Simon Walsh, who works in north-east London, said staff were working in ""major incident mode"" in many hospital trusts across south-east England. He said they were dealing with ""queues of ambulances outside many emergency departments"" and some were considering setting up triage tents - normally reserved for major incidents like terror attacks - outside hospitals. Staff at Queen's Hospital in Romford, east London, are being encouraged to take on additional shifts, and some Covid patients are being cared for in ambulances outside the hospital. The hospital's chief medical officer, Magda Smith, said London's NHS was under ""significant pressure"" and ""we are opening more beds to care for the most unwell patients"". This video can not be played ""Now is the right time... to record our enormous debt of gratitude,"" says NHS England boss Sir Simon Stevens Prof Steve Hams, chief nurse at Gloucestershire Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, said patient numbers were becoming ""increasingly challenging"" and staff were becoming ""increasingly exhausted"". In a new year message to staff recorded at a vaccination centre, NHS England chief executive Sir Simon Stevens said Covid-19 meant 2020 had probably been ""the toughest year most of us can remember"". He said the ""the biggest chink of hope"" for 2021 was that by late spring he expected the NHS to have offered vaccinations to all vulnerable people.

"NHS Shetland is asking people to think about their actions Shetland is ""almost certain"" to be moved into level four restrictions if a new wave of Covid infections continues, health officials have warned. There have been 34 cases within the last week, with the total expected to rise, and 120 people have also been asked to isolate. NHS Grampian confirmed the outbreak is ""associated with a social event and some household transmission"". The board said it was hopeful it could bring transmission under control.

'Stay at home' Hogmanay plea as Covid cases surge The islands that halted an outbreak by locking down early The new confirmed cases have spread from the north mainland of Shetland to Lerwick. There were 14 confirmed cases on Monday and another four on Tuesday. The current situation is described as by far the most serious outbreak in Shetland since March. NHS Shetland said the best way to stop the virus was to stay at home for the next two weeks - and work from home - as much as possible. Speaking to Drivetime, the director of public health for NHS Shetland and NHS Grampian, Susan Webb, said: ""As all of the cases can be linked to the original cluster, we remain hopeful... that we will be able to bring the transmission under control. ""We are monitoring the situation incredibly carefully."" But, she added that if necessary a move to level four would be recommended. Public Health Principal Elizabeth Robinson said: ""This is a virus that knows no bounds. It has infected many in our community during the festive season. ""This is not a time to judge or point fingers but rather for each one of us to look at our own actions and ensure that we are doing everything possible to keep ourselves and others safe.

"All of mainland Scotland moved into the toughest level of coronavirus restrictions on 26 December Almost 1,000 positive tests for Covid-19 have been recorded in the past 24 hours, taking the total number of confirmed cases to more than 120,000. The average number of new cases per day has been rising steadily following a spike of infections before Christmas. The percentage of people testing positive in Scotland has also been higher than 12% for the past two days. National clinical director Prof Jason Leitch urged people not to delay their test if they had symptoms. Scottish government figures,externalshow that 967 cases were reported on Monday, taking the total during the whole pandemic to 120,891. The number of deaths following a positive test remains at 4,416, but no update is being given on this figure between 25 and 28 December. Hospital and ICU figures will also not be updated until 29 December. Covid in Scotland: Where are the latest cases? The ""positivity rate"" reached 12.3% on Sunday - the highest it has been during the second wave of the pandemic and a significant rise on recent weeks. The rate is important because the World Health Organisation says the percentage of positive test results is a key measure when assessing the status of a Covid-19 outbreak within a country. Although the rate fluctuates daily, a two-day period above 12% is notable. The Scottish government said Covid-19 testing centres were open as normal over the Christmas period and people should not put off getting a test if they have symptoms. Delaying tests would ""hamper efforts"" to tacklea new variant of the viruswhich is believed to be much more transmissible. Dumfries and Galloway Health and Social Care Partnership saidcases linked to an outbreak in Wigtownshire had more than doubled over the last two days. The new strain of the virus has been identified as part of this outbreak, which has grown from from 64 cases on Boxing Day to 142 on Monday. Meanwhile concern has been raised that Shetland could be moved from level three to level four, amid a rise in cases. There have been 10 cases linked to North Mainland in the last 24 hours 120 people have been asked to isolate. Prof Leitch said it was ""paramount"" people did not delay getting a test. ""Getting tested also helps to give us the up-to-date data on how Covid-19 is spreading, which we need to tackle the virus,"" he said. ""If people delay that testing then they are potentially putting other people at risk. ""So if you have a high temperature or fever, new continuous cough or a change in sense of smell or taste, you should self-isolate and please book a test immediately."" All of mainland Scotlandmoved into the toughest level of coronavirus restrictionson 26 December. Millions of people are now living under level four curbs - the highest of the country's five-tier system of anti-virus measures. The change means non-essential retail and hospitality have been closed and additional travel restrictions imposed to curb a new strain of the virus. The restrictions are due to be reviewed in three weeks. LEVELS:What are the restrictions in your area? LOCKDOWN:Six months that changed our lives CASES:Where are the latest cases in Scotland?

"People under the age of 40 are to be offered an alternative to the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine in the UK as a precaution, after a review of all the latest evidence by vaccine advisers and safety experts. The UK's medicine regulator - the MHRA - says the benefits of the vaccine still outweigh the risks for the vast majority of people. Under 40s to be offered alternative to AZ vaccine The Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) - the body which advises the government - has now recommended that ""adults aged 18- 39 years with no underlying health conditions are offered an alternative to the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine, if available, and if it does not cause delays in having the vaccine"". Data from the MHRA suggests there's a very small - but slightly higher than normal - incidence of a rare type of clot in younger adult age groups, particularly when the risk of being infected with coronavirus is very low, as it is now. The risk of a clot is roughly one in 100,000 for people in their 40s, and rises to one in 60,000 for people in their 30s. Based on the current data, the following is advised: Anyone who experiences clotting after a first dose of the vaccine should not receive a second dose People with a history of blood disorders (at risk of clotting) should only have the AstraZeneca when the benefits outweigh the risks Pregnant women should talk to their GPs about the benefits and risks The MHRA looked into UK cases of rare blood clots in people who had recently received the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine. It found 242 cases of clotting cases and 49 deaths after an estimated 28.5 million AstraZeneca vaccines doses were administered across the UK up to 28 April. The MHRA said about four people in a million would normally be expected to develop this particular kind of blood clot - though the fact they are so rare makes the usual rate hard to estimate. And the regulator said it had not been proven that the jab had caused the clots. Its head, Dr June Raine, said while the link was ""firming up"", more evidence would be needed. The benefits of the AstraZeneca vaccine outweigh the risks of the virus - hospitalisation and death - for the vast majority of people, she said. But for younger age groups it was more ""finely balanced"". 'Encouraging' antibody boost after both Covid jabs The MHRA study looked at people who had developed clots associated with a low level of platelets after receiving the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine. Platelets are tiny blood cells that help your body form clots to stop bleeding. Among these clots is a type called a Cerebral Venous Sinus Thrombosis (CSVT). CVST occurs when a blood clot forms in large veins in the head - stopping blood from draining out of the brain. As a result, blood cells may break and leak into brain tissue - ultimately leading to a stroke. The clot can occur naturally and are more common, but still very rare, in younger women. The MHRA says anyone who has these symptoms four or more days after receiving the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine should seek prompt medical advice: A severe or persistent headache Blurred vision Chest pain Shortness of breath Swollen legs Persistent abdominal pain Unusual skin bruising Pinpoint spots (not including the injection site) Covid infection itself can make clots more likely, stresses the MHRA. The European Medicines Agency (EMA) has said clottingshould be listed as a very rare vaccine side effect. After a study looking at 86 such cases in the EU, the EMA concluded the benefits of the vaccine outweighed the risk and that there was no definite causal link. Nevertheless,Denmarkhas stopped its AstraZeneca rollout completely - andGermany,Spain, Italy andIrelandhave suspended use of the vaccine in people under 60. France is recommending it only be given to those aged 55 or over, whileAustraliasays people aged under 50 should get the Pfizer jab instead. It is made from a weakened version of a common cold virus (known as an adenovirus) from chimpanzees. It has been modified to contain genetic material shared by the coronavirus - although it can't cause the illness. Once injected, it teaches the body's immune system how to fight the real virus. How do we know Covid vaccines are safe? How do the Covid vaccines compare? Experts are studying all of the current coronavirus vaccines to check how well they work against new, mutated variants of the virus. The government's deputy chief medical officer, Jonathan Van Tam, says there is ""plenty of evidence"" the vaccines appear to beeffective against the Kent variantwhich is dominant in the UK. There is less evidence about protection against other variants, such as those identified in Brazil and South Africa. However astudy of around 2,000 peoplesuggests, while the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine may offer more limited protection against mild and moderate disease caused by the South Africa variant. it should still protect against severe disease.

"This video can not be played Covid in Scotland: Nicola Sturgeon urges people to 'stay at home' this Hogmanay Scots have been urged to stay at home and not celebrate Hogmanay with other households as daily Covid-19 case numbers hit a record high. Another 1,895 cases were reported on Tuesday - the highest logged on a single day since mass testing began. The whole Scottish mainland is in thehighest level of restrictionsin a bid to contain a new strain of the virus. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said it was ""especially vital"" people did not mix indoors with other households. The near 2,000 cases reported on Tuesday was double the number logged on Monday, with 14.4% of tests returning a positive result. Ms Sturgeon said there had been ""quite a big jump in cases"", although there could be a ""Christmas lag"" in reporting some results. Covid in Scotland: Where are the latest cases? Shetland 'set for level 4' if Covid cases rise Confirmed Covid cases in Scotland pass 120,000 She said the new strain of Covid-19 was ""contributing to faster spread"" of the virus, with a rising trend across the country and particular concerns over Shetland and the south of Scotland. The first minister said: ""The main message to people is to make sure you are not visiting other people's houses just now. Unfortunately that includes Hogmanay and New Year. ""This is a time of year I know people enjoy getting together, but that's not safe to do this year. ""As we head into the Hogmanay and new year period I really do appeal to people to stay out of the homes of others, celebrate new year in your own home only with your own household."" A further seven deaths of patients who had tested positive for Covid-19 in the last 28 days were also reported on Tuesday, although registration offices were closed over the festive break and the publication of most figures has been delayed. As of Tuesday there were 1,092 people in hospital with a recently-confirmed case of the virus, with 65 in intensive care. The whole of mainland Scotland has been in level four - the top tier of measures - since Boxing Day, and will remain there for at least three weeks. Officials are also considering on a daily basis whether to escalate restrictions on Scotland's islands, which are currently in level three. Ms Sturgeon said the situation in Shetland in particular was being ""very clearly monitored"". She also said there were concerns about ""quite significant increases"" in cases in Dumfries and Galloway and the Borders. MSPs are to be given an update on the latest situation on Wednesday, when the Scottish Parliament is being recalled from recess to debate the Brexit deal.

"This video can not be played Pierre Cardin: The designer ""one step ahead of tomorrow"" Legendary designer Pierre Cardin, whose futuristic and stylish designs helped revolutionise fashion in the 1950s and 60s, has died at the age of 98. The French fashion giant, whose career spanned more than 70 years, helped usher in the post-war ""golden age"" of couture with his modern style. He broke ground by bringing designer styles to the masses with some of the first ready-to-wear collections. A business pioneer, he also licensed his name for a wide range of products. Obituary: Pierre Cardin In pictures: Pierre Cardin's life in fashion He died in hospital in Neuilly, near Paris, his family told the AFP news agency. ""It is a day of great sadness for all our family. Pierre Cardin is no more,"" they said in a statement. ""We are all proud of his tenacious ambition and the daring he has shown throughout his life."" After the news was announced, his official Instagram account posted one of his quotes: ""I have always worked in my own style, which is different from all others. It was always my intention to be different, because that is the only way to last."" Allow Instagram content? This article contains content provided by Instagram.

The fashion world paid tribute, with fellow French designerJean-Paul Gaultier thanking him,externalfor ""opening the doors to fashion and for making my dream possible"". Elle magazine editor-in-chief and Project Runway judgeNina Garcia said,externalCardin's designs showed ""how fashion has the power to design the future"". She wrote,external: ""His curiosity, his vision and his love for the art of fashion helped shape the dreams of many women during the second half of the 20th Century. ""Even today his designs are truly modern, with silhouettes and fabrics that have inspired many contemporary designers."" BBC Culture: The influences of 60s space-age fashions Benetton artistic director Jean-Charles de Castelbajac said Cardin was an ""a very extraordinary man"" who did not set borders between fashion, design or architecture. He told AFP that ""his inspiration boosted my imagination"", and that for Cardin, the marketing and promotion of his art ""was as important as the art itself"". Photographer and former modelNigel Barker tweeted,external: ""We have lost a legend... Fashion Designer Pierre Cardin who revolutionized the industry with his futuristic designs and think outside of the box business approach has passed away today."" Cardin's helmet-like hats were inspired by the sci-fi fantasies and space race of the 1960s Cardin was born in Italy in 1922 but moved to France as a child. He began his fashion career in Paris working for firms including Christian Dior, for whom he helped create the New Look collection in 1947. He set up his own fashion company in 1950 and made his name with visionary designs like the iconic bubble dress in 1954 and his Space Age collection in 1964. At the end of the 1950s, he launched his first ready-to-wear collection for the Printemps department store. While pop stars and actors like the Beatles and Lauren Bacall were seen wearing Cardin, his cutting-edge designs were also within reach of ordinary customers. Cardin with models in 1962 With a savvy business sense, he also came to recognise the appeal of the name on the label, and allowed his to be used on goods ranging from sunglasses to perfume, pens and food. However, to some, that expansion diluted the appeal of his core business. Justine Picardie, contributing editor of Harper's Bazaar magazine, told BBC Radio 4's The World At One: ""He became synonymous with those global licensing deals - anything from ties and pens to cars. ""He was also synonymous with the popularisation and democratisation of fashion, and with this idea of the space age."" Cardin also set his sights on a new globalised world market, presenting a collection in Communist China in 1979, and Moscow's Red Square in 1991.

Shares in the company - whose websites include the Lookfantastic beauty products business - soared more than 9% on the news. Since it floated in September at 500p, its shares have risen more than 50%. That triggered a massive Â£1bn payout for the boss, one of the biggest paydays in UK corporate history. The company has grown rapidly by snapping up skincare and lifestyle brands while also operating online platforms for other brands. Health and beauty boss in line for Â£830m payout Manchester group donates Â£10m to coronavirus fight It owns brands such as Glossybox and MyProtein and powers the websites of major businesses, including Honda and Nestle. It said the purchase of Dermstore would ""enhance its beauty strategy by substantially enhancing its relationships with the key global beauty brands"".

The Hut Group also added UK nutrition product suppliers Claremont Ingredients and David Berryman to its portfolio on Tuesday for Â£59.5m. Claremont Ingredients operates a flavour manufacturing and development laboratory for sports nutrition and beverages, while the David Berryman business supplies and develops fruit-based ingredients.

"This video can not be played People travelling to the Brecon Beacons were turned away Police are turning away visitors to the Brecon Beacons from as far away as London - 180 miles away. Wales is onalert level fourso people must not travel into or out of the country and can only leave home for essential reasons. On Monday and Tuesday,cars filled a car parkbelow Pen y Fan, the highest mountain in southern Britain. Dyfed-Powys Police said more than 500 vehicles were in the area on Tuesday, including a minibus from Cheltenham. The force said people from mixed households travelled in the minibus, while they had also spoken to a man who had travelled from Hertfordshire. ""Fixed penalty notices have and will be issued to those blatant breaches where engagement fails,"" it added. A large number of people were seen at Pen y Fan on Monday Meanwhile, an intensive care consultant said the scenes were ""very disappointing"" as hospitalswere under pressure. Dr David Hepburn said he understands why people want to visit beauty spots but it was against the rules. He said it was still unclear what impact Christmas had had on case numbers. ""All the hospitals across the health board are now very, very full,"" said Dr Hepburn, who works as a consultant in the Aneurin Bevan University Health Board. He said while his intensive care unit was coping, he added: ""We've still got quite a lot of time to go before this pandemic is under control, so really anything could happen over the next month or so."" Police have been turning people away from the area Police roadblocks were in place on Tuesday in the Brecon Beacons, with cars lining the A470 to gain access to the area. Visitors to the national park on Tuesday also included people from London, currentlyunder tier-four restrictions, as well as numerous visitors from Swansea, Cardiff and Newport. Q&A: What has changed as Wales locks down? Crowds head for Brecon Beacons as snow falls What's the advice on travelling over Christmas?

"The deepfake queen's Christmas video More than 200 people have complained to the UK's media watchdog Ofcom about Channel 4's alternative Christmas message, which featured a deepfake of the Queen. The broadcaster said its intention had been to give a ""stark warning"" about fake news in the digital age. But commentators said the jokes made in the show were ""disrespectful"" and in ""poor taste"". The watchdog is now deciding whether to take action. In the video, the deepfakereferred to rumours of rifts in the Royal Family, toilet roll shortages and Prime Minister Boris Johnson's number of children. The computer-generated version of the monarch also gyrated to music while dancing on top of a desk to show off ""moves for TikTok"". While the message did not carry a warning that it had been faked, its ending revealed the conceit: an actress was shown seated in front of a greenscreen, having her face mapped to create the digital replica. Deepfakes use technology to create what can be convincing digital copies of real people, which can be used to spread misinformation. This video can not be played WATCH: The face-swapping software explained But in this case, Channel 4 said it should have been obvious this was not the real Queen. ""It is very clear in the four-minute film that it is a parody of the Christmas Day address and viewers were left in no doubt that it was not real,"" a Channel 4 spokeswoman said. ""However, while the film is light-hearted, affectionate and comedic in tone, it carries a very important and timely message about trust and the ease with which convincing misinformation can be created and spread."" The video forms part of a series of programmes examining the spread of misinformation, she added. Some viewers expressed their distaste on social media, with some labelling the video as being ""disgusting"". Making âcheap jokesâ about the Royal Family was in âpoor tasteâ, Penny Junor, a royal biographer and commentator, told the BBC. âThe Queen has had a tough year and making those things into a national joke is tasteless. âShe has been extraordinary during the pandemic and shown real leadership and courage, stepping up at a time when many had lost trust and faith in politics.â The deepfake queen also danced on a desk in the video Ofcom confirmed it had received 214 complaints about the episode and was now consulting the Broadcasting Code to decide whether a formal investigation is required. But this represents a relatively low number of complaints compared to: 18,600 -to the BBC over a racial slur 1,900 -over Alesha Dixon's BLM necklace 3,800 -for Piers Morgan's ""combative"" interviews 419 -about Eamon Holmes' 5G comments A review in the Telegraph noted that Channel 4 had a remit to take creative risks,but criticised the script,externalfor its ""toothless satire"" rather than for being offensive.

"Fou studied in Poland and was known for his interpretations of the Polish composer Chopin Fou Ts'ong, the first Chinese pianist to win global acclaim and success, has died aged 86 after contracting Covid-19. Fou died on Monday in London, where he had been living since the 1950s. His death was confirmed to the BBC by Jianing Kong, a professor at the Royal College of Music and student of Fou's. Responding to the news on Tuesday, the renowned Chinese pianist Lang Lang described Fou as ""a truly great pianist, and our spiritual beacon"". Fou was born in China in 1934 to a family of China's intellectual elite. He first heard western classical music at a young age when his father, the renowned translator Fu Lei, returned to China after several years living in France. As a budding pianist, he studied with the founder and head of the Shanghai Symphony Orchestra, Italian conductor Mario Paci, who had been crucial in bringing western classical music to China. Aged 19, Fou left China to continue his musical education in Europe, moving to then-Communist Poland to study in Warsaw. Two years later, he won awards and international recognition at the prestigious Chopin competition in the city. Fou Ts'ong during a recording session in 1964 In 1959, Fou moved to London and grew into an internationally acclaimed soloist, playing both in Europe and the United States, and performing in 1967 at the BBC's First Night of the Proms. In 1960 he had married Zamira Menuhin, the daughter of the renowned violinist Yehudi Menuhin. The couple had a son and divorced in 1969. Fou later married the Chinese pianist Patsy Toh and had another son. While he was living in London, Fou's parents were persecuted in Maoist China during the anti-intellectual Cultural Revolution. They took their own lives in 1966. Allow YouTube content? This article contains content provided by Google YouTube.

Staying true to his earlier training in Poland, Fou became especially known for his interpretations of Chopin. He continued to be associated with the Polish composer, and the Chopin Institute said in a statement on Wednesday that his death marked""the closure of an extremely important page in the Chopin tradition"",external. ""We say goodbye to the master, musician, philosopher who, like no other, was able to tell the world the greatness of Chopin through words, but above all through his play,"" the institute said. French pianist Francois Guy wrote on Twitter thatFou had been his ""mentor and a musical father"",external. ""His Debussy, Chopin and Mozart remain legendary,"" Mr Guy wrote. Fou Ts'ong pictured in London in 1966 Lang Lang wrote on the China's Weibo social media platform on Tuesday that Fou had been a great inspiration for him, recollecting the support he received from the veteran pianist early on in his career. ""I still remember the time when I played Rachmaninov's Piano Concert No. 3 for the first time in London in 2001. After the concert, he gave me a hug with tears in his eyes, and said that he had high hopes for me,"" Lang Lang wrote. ""Master Fou was a great artist that I respected very much. I will never forget what he said about always staying kind and pure-hearted. His understanding of music was unique.""

"Britain's index of leading shares closed at its highest since the pandemic sparked a market rout in March as investors on Tuesday cheered the post-Brexit trade deal. In the first day of trading since markets closed on Christmas Eve, the FTSE 100 ended up 1.6% at 6,603 points. It was the Footsie's best day since 9 November, and only falls in bank shares stopped the index from rising further. US shares hit record highs in early trading although ended slightly lower. Wall Street was buoyed by US President Donald Trump agreeing to release hundreds of billions of dollars in pandemic spending support. He had previously refused to sign off on the deal. On the FTSE 100, international companies such as Unilever and Diageo gave the biggest boost to the index, while drugmakers AstraZeneca and GlaxoSmithKline also added to the gains. ""The [Brexit trade] deal should see sentiment towards the FTSE indices recover just as the dividend payout ratio improves, vaccines are rolled out and overseas revenues accelerate. We lift UK equities to Bullish,"" analysts at brokerage Jefferies wrote in a note. UK set for 'bumpy' period as new EU rules come in Banks accounted for three of the five biggest fallers on the FTSE 100, with worst-hit Lloyds suffering a near 5% drop. One analyst, Shanti Keleman from Brown Shipley, put the falling UK bank shares down to ""no agreement on financial services equivalency in the Brexit deal"". However, Simon French of Panmure Gordon pointed out that trading was thin even by the usual standards of this time of year. ""The usual market narratives are even shakier than normal,"" he added. After four years of uncertainty, the deal made it a lot more clear what the UK's relationship with its closest neighbours is likely to look like in the years ahead. It also removed the prospect of a no-deal Brexit, which had put downward pressure on markets. Among the biggest risers in London was drug firm AstraZeneca, which gained 3.3% on reports that the government is poised to approve its Covid-19 vaccine, paving the way for UK citizens to receive it as early as next week. Travel shares also benefited from market optimism, led by Intercontinental Hotels Group, which climbed 3%. London's rise on Tuesday followed gains on Monday for the main markets in Frankfurt and Paris, as well as on Wall Street. The Paris Cac-40 continued its rally on Tuesday, adding 0.4%. However, Frankfurt's Dax index took a sudden turn for the worse late in the afternoon, dipping 0.2%. Earlier, shares in Asia surged in Tuesday trading, with Japan's Nikkei closing more than 2.6% higher. UK set for 'bumpy' period as new EU rules come in Which mobile providers have roaming charges?

"Breonna Taylor was killed by police in Louisville, Kentucky last March (file picture) A statue of Breonna Taylor, an African-American woman who was shot dead by police during a raid on her home in March, has been smashed in California. It happened two weeks after the bust was erected in the city of Oakland. Police have launched an investigation. Sculptor Leo Carson called the destruction an act of ""racist aggression"". He said he would rebuild the piece in bronze. Ms Taylor's death spurred protests against racism and police brutality. The ceramic bust in Oakland depicted her smiling, with a message on its base that reads:  ""Say her name: Breonna Taylor."" It was found smashed on Saturday. The Oakland police department said late on Monday that it was investigating what appeared to be an act of vandalism, but had not yet identified any suspects or motive. What happened to Breonna Taylor? Timeline of US police killings Black Lives Matter in the UK: 'We're still not being heard' Oakland Mayor Libby Schaaf described it as a ""vicious attack against the light [and] justice sought in Breonna Taylor's name."" ""We will keep moving forward; Oakland will not tolerate acts of hatred,"" she wrote on Twitter. Mr Carson told local media that he made the statue to honour the legacy of the Black Lives Matter movement. He said he was ""devastated and enraged"" that it had been destroyed, but announced on Monday that he had raised enough money to rebuild the statue in bronze. Allow Instagram content?

Plainclothes police officers stormed Ms Taylor's Louisville home shortly after midnight on 13 March. The 26-year-old medical technician was in bed with her boyfriend, Kenneth Walker, at the time. The officers were executing a search warrant as part of a drugs investigation. Mr Walker fired a shot from his licensed gun, later telling police he thought that Ms Taylor's ex-boyfriend had broken in, according to the New York Times.

Ms Taylor was shot amid the commotion and died on the hallway floor. No drugs were found at the property, though Jefferson County Prosecutor Thomas Wine said the search was cancelled after the shooting. Ms Taylor's family sued Louisville authorities in May and reached a $12m (Â£9.4m) settlement. None of the officers have been charged with Ms Taylor's death. One wascharged in September with ""wanton endangerment""for firing into a neighbour's apartment. What happened to Breonna Taylor? Breonna Taylor's boyfriend recalls night she was killed.

"This video can not be played People were seen singing and dancing at Bronte Beach on Christmas Day Australia's immigration minister has said that backpackers and other foreign visitors caught flouting public health restrictions could be deported. Alex Hawke said he was shocked by scenes from Sydney's Bronte Beach on Christmas Day. Videos of the gathering shared on social media showed hordes of young revellers singing and dancing in breach of coronavirus regulations. Some eyewitnesses said many of those present were British. Sydney is battling a new outbreak after months of no local cases. The virus's re-appearance a week before Christmas sparked a swift re-introduction of restrictions in the city, including clampdowns on holiday gatherings and a lockdown of the worst-affected region, the Northern Beaches. Sydney cut off from rest of Australia amid outbreak The outbreak has already grown to 129 cases. Most of the people present did not seem to be locals, witnesses said ""If somebody is threatening public safety or health, their visa can be cancelled and revoked,"" Mr Hawke tolda Sydney radio station,external. He said he had asked the federal Department of Home Affairs to work with New South Wales (NSW) state authorities in the lead up to New Year's Day so that anyone caught ""doing the wrong thing"" might have their visa status examined by the federal government. Most temporary visa holders were obeying public health orders, he later told ABC News. He did not specify how the government might track down rule breakers. None of the Bronte partygoers were fined or otherwise penalised, police said. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The Labor opposition also suggested the threat was a ""photo opp with no follow up"", given the department's already strained resources and backlog of immigration claims. Australia closed its borders to almost everyone except returning citizens or permanent residents and their families in March. People have also been granted exemptions to arrive in the country. Thegovernment said in April that there were over two million people in the country on temporary visas,externalat that time. On Christmas Day, hundreds of unmasked young people were seen drinking, dancing and singing in the park next to Bronte Beach, which neighbours the famous Bondi Beach in east Sydney. Holiday parties among backpackers in the tourist hotspot have been a common occurrence in other years. Witnesses told the BBC they believed the majority of revellers were from the UK or ""not Australian"". ""You could hear lots of clearly English accents, and several people were wearing the white English football jerseys,"" said Peter Hannam, a local journalist who had passed the crowds while on a walk with his family.

""We had to move through them on our path and the crowd was sort of pulsating... and well we thought we don't really want to hang around here because it doesn't look very safe."" He said a police squad and helicopter later arrived at the scene. Video shared on social media showed lingering groups carrying on with their activities as police circulated and tried to disperse people. NSW Police told the BBC that no penalties were issued to those attending the gathering. ""It was an operational decision at the time, there being so many people to deal with,"" said NSW Police spokesman Scott Willis. ""It's not always possible to take action against everyone there."" Police issued fines to other rule breakers on Christmas Day including guests at a house party in Bondi which was over capacity, and to a woman who drove out of her locked-down suburb for a Christmas visit. Reports of the gathering have sparked widespread community anger. Many Australians vented frustrations online, deeming the behaviour ""selfish"" in contrast to those who endured lockdown restrictions, or were otherwise separated from family over Christmas. NSW state health minister Brad Hazzard said the potential ""superspreader"" event undermined collective efforts. ""It is absolutely appalling to see what was clearly a group of people, a large gathering of people, who didn't give a damn about the rest of Sydney,"" he told reporters on Saturday. ""Many of those backpackers come here to Australia and are enjoying the relative freedoms we have here,"" he added. ""If they were in Europe right now, most of them would be in lockdown and not even allowed outside the front door."" This video can not be played Sydney beaches were closed for a few weeks in March during the first wave Others have also criticised the police response, arguing the partygoers had been let off far too easily, especially given how police have dealt with other transgressions. During a heavily-policed lockdown earlier this year, NSW Police issued A$1,000 (Â£560) fines for violations such as people venturing out of their lockdown zones and lingering in parks. In one case, a man was fined for eating a kebab on a bench - in breach of a stay-at-home order. Critics say the laws - which are applied with police discretion - have disproportionately affected poorer, marginalised communities. NSW Police declined to comment on these allegations. Similar criticism was also levelled at Victoria Police during Melbourne's lengthy lockdown. Melbourne towers lockdown 'breached human rights' Australia 'anti-lockdown' arrest stirs controversy Officer suspended over 'head kick' arrest during Melbourne lockdown Melbourne police 'attacked and baited' over curfew Ahead of Sydney's traditional New Year's Eve fireworks celebrations, authorities have banned group gatherings at vantage points around the harbour. Officials continue to urge locals to exercise caution, warning of a potential uptick in cases following Christmas and New Year's gatherings. Australia has recorded 909 deaths and about 28,300 cases since the pandemic began - a number far lower than many other rich nations.

"This video can not be played The earthquake caused extensive damage in Petrinja and Zagreb At least seven people are known to have died in a magnitude 6.4 earthquake that struck central Croatia on Tuesday. Rescue teams spent the night scouring the rubble of damaged buildings in the search for survivors. A 12-year-old girl was killed in Petrinja, the prime minister said as he visited the town. Five people died in the nearby town of Glina, his deputy said. A seventh victim was found in the rubble of a church in Zazina, state media reports. Petrinja's mayor said that about half the town had been destroyed and people had been pulled from the rubble. Many were too afraid to return to their homes overnight in case aftershocks caused more damage, officials said. Some people slept in their cars or stayed with relatives in other areas. About 200 people sheltered in a military barracks. EU crisis management chief Janez Lenarcic is due to visit Petrinja on Wednesday. The search for survivors continued overnight The earthquake was felt in the Croatian capital Zagreb, in neighbouring Bosnia and Serbia, and as far away as Italy. One woman was pulled alive from the rubble of the town hall in Petrinja on Tuesday, Croatian media reported. Some of the injured were evacuated to Zagreb ""We are pulling people from the cars, we don't know if we have dead or injured,"" Darinko Dumbovic, the mayor of Petrinja, told regional broadcaster N1 on Tuesday. ""There is general panic, people are looking for their loved ones."" The mayor was speaking to reporters when Petrinja, home to 20,000 people, was hit by another, weaker, tremor.

""All the tiles in the bathroom are broken, all the dishes fell out,"" one resident, 72-year-old Marica Pavlovic, told AFP news agency. ""Even if we wanted to, we can't go back in, there is no electricity."" People were also injured in the nearby town of Sisak. National broadcaster HRT said the local hospital there was struggling to cope with the number of casualties arriving for treatment. Some displaced people have been forced to sleep at a military base Tomislav Fabijanic, head of emergency medical services in Sisak, said they were seeing fractures and concussions, and some people had needed surgery. The GFZ German Research Centre for Geosciences reported that the earthquake struck at 11:19 GMT at a depth of 10km (6 miles). The second tremor followed an hour or so later. The Croatian Mountain Rescue Service said that rescuers from across Croatia had travelled to Petrinja to help with the search and recovery effort. Allow Twitter content?

Prime Minister Andrej Plenkovic, who rushed to Petrinja, said: ""The army is here to help. We will have to move some people from Petrinja because it is unsafe to be here,"" he added. Croatia's president and prime minister saw for themselves the scale of damage in Petrinja within two hours of the earthquake and were united in their response. President Zoran Milanovic compared the scene to Grozny, the capital of the the Russian republic of Chechnya, which was largely destroyed during a siege 20 years ago. The prime minister said it was ""clear as day"" that Petrinja was no longer safe for human habitation. Petrinja is home to some 20,000 residents and the prime minister said it was now unsafe to live in It is a bitter blow for the town's people, who faced a significant rebuilding operation after Croatia's war of independence in the 1990s. More recently, they have been tackling economic devastation, with the decline of traditional industries. Croatia's leaders have promised funds for reconstruction. But Petrinja's residents will be seeing in the new year in temporary accommodation - with little prospect of an early return home. A kindergarten also collapsed in Petrinja, but it was empty at the time of the quake. In a village just outside Petrinja, a worker told N1 that nine of its 10 houses were destroyed. Slovenia has moved to close the Krsko nuclear power plant it co-owns with Croatia. The US Geological Survey said it was the largest earthquake to occur in Croatia since the introduction of modern seismic instrumentation. An earthquake of similar size occurred in 1880 near Zagreb. A magnitude 5.2 earthquake hit central Croatia on Monday and there are fears of more. Branko Dragicevic of the Serbian seismological institute told the BBC: ""We can expect further quakes.""

"Margaret Keenan was given the follow-up vaccine at University Hospital in Coventry The first person in the world to be given the Pfizer Covid-19 jab as part of a mass vaccination programme has received a second dose. Margaret Keenan was given the follow-up vaccine at University Hospital in Coventry earlier - three weeks after the first. The hospital's chief executive Andy Hardy said the hospital was ""delighted"" to welcome Margaret back. Two doses of the vaccine are needed to give the best chance of protection. The grandmother, who is originally from Enniskillen, Co Fermanagh, received afirst injection on 8 December, a week before her 91st birthday, and described it as the ""best early birthday present"". NHS England said at the time that she would have a ""booster jab"" 21 days later ""to ensure she has the best chance of being protected against the virus"". The patient was ""now recovering well"" after her second jab, the hospital said. The initial jabs were given in hospitals, but the rollout has since widened to GP-led sites and care homes - with more than 600,000 having had the initial vaccination, Department of Health figures showed. ""Our hardworking staff who have been involved in the vaccination programme have remained in contact with Margaret's family since that day and we are delighted that Margaret has been continuing to recover well at home following her discharge from hospital,"" said Mr Hardy. ""It's important that everyone comes forward to get the jab when they are invited to do so,"" he added. Follow BBC West Midlands onFacebook,external,Twitter,externalandInstagram,external.

"Boris Johnson and Ursula von der Leyen are set to sign the deal on Wednesday The UK-EU post-Brexit trade deal will be signed in Brussels on Wednesday by EU chiefs - before being flown to London for Boris Johnson to sign. Downing Street said an RAF plane will transport the international treaty, accompanied by UK and EU officials. It will come a day before the UK severs ties with the 27 nation organisation. The UK Parliament is being recalled to vote on the agreement, which sets the rules for a new trade and security relationship between the UK and EU. The deal was agreed in Brussels on Christmas Eve, following nine months of negotiations. EU ambassadors approve post-Brexit trade deal Starmer faces revolt over backing for Brexit deal Brexit deal mentions Netscape's long-dead browser The European Parliament has begun its scrutiny of the agreement but will not get a chance to ratify it before the UK leaves the EU single market and customs union at midnight on Thursday. The deal has, however, been given the unanimous backing of ambassadors from the 27 nations and the member states gave their written approval earlier on Tuesday. That paves the way for European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and European Council President Charles Michel to sign the treaty on Wednesday morning in Brussels. It will then be flown across the Channel for the UK prime minister to sign it in Downing Street, a No 10 spokesman said. Both houses of the UK Parliament are set to vote on a bill putting the agreement into UK law on Wednesday. MPs are set to debate theEU (future relationship) Bill,externalfor five hours, starting at 09:30 GMT, before a vote. It is expected to clear the Commons with the backing of the opposition Labour Party, although some Labour MPs - and all the other opposition parties - are planning to vote against it or abstain. It will then move on to the Lords, which is also expected to back it, before receiving Royal Assent. The key points of the deal What does the deal mean for fishing? How your Europe holidays will change Prime Minister Boris Johnson hashailed the deal, which comes four and half years since the UK voted to leave the EU and a year after it officially left, as the first of its kind in history. The PM says it will deliver on his general election promise to ""take back control"" of the UK's laws, borders, money and fishing waters. And he claimed the Â£668bn a year agreement would ""protect jobs across this country"" and ""enable UK goods to be sold without tariffs, without quotas in the EU market"". Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer - who campaigned against Brexit - has described it as a ""thin"" deal which does not do enough to protect jobs, the environment and workers' rights. But he has ordered Labour MPs to back it as the only alternative was leaving without a deal, which he said would have been devastating for the UK economy. Northern Ireland's political parties that take their seats at Westminsterwill be voting against the deal- as will theScottish National Partyand Welsh nationalists Plaid Cymru. But the prime minister has received a boost from a powerful group of backbench Tory Brexiteers, who have indicated they will back the deal. The European Research Group (ERG) said its panel of legal experts had examined the text in detail and concluded that it ""preserves the UK's sovereignty as a matter of law"". It comes as the UK government announced it has signed a deal that will allow British businesses to continue trading with Turkey on the same terms after Brexit. The tariff-free arrangements underpin a trading relationship which the UK government said was worth Â£18.6bn last year. The government said both sides are ""committed to working towards a more ambitious free trade agreement"". The UK rolled over dozens of trade deals with countries around the world since deciding to leave the EU's trading arrangements. The vast majority of the 62 trade deals the UK has signed over the past two years have retained the same terms as before Brexit.

"Raw sausages and other minced meats can no longer be exported to the EU from 1 January, according to new rules. The guidance is part of the post-Brexit trade deal agreed between the UK and the EU last week. Meat industry bodies attended a conference call with ministers on Tuesday to seek clarification about the issue. The British Meat Processors Association said it was one of several issues causing concern. New EU rules on exports,externaldictate that from 1 January, the following animal products cannot be exported into the EU: Chilled minced red meat Chilled meat preparations (for example, raw sausages) Minced meat (poultry) Poultry and ratite or game bird mechanically-separated meat Raw milk from cows infected with Bovine Tuberculosis (TB) Ungraded eggs Composite products containing dairy products made from unpasteurised milk (for example, a ready meal topped with unpasteurised cheese) However, these new rules do not affect exports of raw minced meats to Northern Ireland. The British Meat Processors Association's (BMPA) chief executive Nick Allen said: âThis was just one of the issues that was causing us some concern, but I guess towards the end we sort of knew that wasn't going to come through in the negotiations, the way they were going. ""We hope they will be carrying on talking to the EU and that they will push through and create an export health safety certificate for these products so they can go through. The BMPA is hoping that more clarity on what businesses need to do will help it to prepare their members ahead of the new year. Mr Allen added that the call was also to decide the wording on the new export health certificates. ""That wording tells us what we have to comply with and we hope we are not going to hear that there are things we're not expecting to be on there,"" he said. Wilfred Emmanuel Jones says the frozen meat sector needs a makeover and British sausages should be exported frozen Wilfred Emmanuel Jones is a British Devon-based farmer and founder of The Black Farmer line of meat products, including raw sausages. Since he will no longer be allowed to export fresh sausages to the EU, he has decided to send them frozen instead. ""There's a really big opportunity to do premium frozen sausages for the continent,"" he explained. ""One problem we have with sausages is that in this country at least, anything frozen is seen as down-market, not a premium product."" The UK is the only country in Europe that makes and exports raw sausages. Other countries, as well as the US, all produce pre-cooked sausages, as they have a longer shelf life than raw ones, said Mr Jones. But rather than give up on British traditions and make pre-cooked sausages, he thinks that sausage makers need to bring in freezing equipment. ""I think we should have a British sausage mark, so if you're going to be selling sausages to any part of the world, it's unique to any of the sausages around the world,"" he added. A government spokeswoman said: âWe have agreed a deal based on friendly cooperation between sovereign equals, centred on free trade and inspired by our shared history and values. âIt takes the UK completely out of the EUâs customs union and single market â which means businesses should continue their preparations for changes next year.â Brexit deal is 'best Christmas present I could have' UK set for 'bumpy' period as new EU rules come in Which mobile providers have roaming charges?

"Wales has different coronavirus restrictions to other parts of the UK People in Wales have been told to stay at home and not travel over the new year after the country went into national lockdown.

"Teaching moved online for secondary schools in the final week before Christmas A teachers' union wants to know if shutting schools early before Christmas did anything to bring down the Covid-19 transmission rate in Wales. The Association of School and College Leaders Cymru (ASCLC) also called for quick action on plans for schooling if cases continued to rise in Wales with a new strain of the virus circulating. Children are set to return to school in January on a staggered basis. The Welsh Government said it was closely monitoring transmission rates. Before Christmas, scientific advice suggested families with children should consider ""pre-isolating"" at home for 10 days before seeing elderly relatives. Allow Twitter content?

The advice was contained in a report by the Welsh Government's Technical Advisory Group (TAG). All secondary schools and colleges shut a week early but some counties kept primary schools open until 18 December. Staggered return for Wales' schools in January Covid hospital pressures 'incredibly challenging' Figuring out the stats on coronavirus in Wales As of 23 December, the R number had increased again to between 1 and 1.3 in Wales, with an estimate from Public Health Wales of 1.2 based on case rates. This means for every 10 people with the virus, 12 more people would be infected. ""We closed for a week at the end of last term to try to get the R rate down,"" said Eithne Hughes, director of the ASCLC. ""Have things changed significantly as a consequence of schools closing?"" Ms Hughes said there needed to be very clear communication if there was any change of plan on schools returning. ""We need to know extremely quickly in order that parents and schools know exactly where they are in a very short space of time,"" she added. Head Chris Britten wants to see school workers prioritised for vaccines Chris Britten is head of Ysgol Y Deri Special School in Penarth, Vale of Glamorgan, which has had over 60 positive Covid results since November. He said: ""It keeps you awake at nightâ¦ ""We've had a lot of staff who are very ill and remain ill. ""When I get a member of staff in intensive care you do sort of think 'maybe we should have done more, maybe we should have done something different' -  but that way kind of lies madness really, we do everything we can."" He wants to see school workers prioritised for vaccines, more regular testing in schools and for any changes to plans for children to return in January to be communicated as soon as possible. He added: ""There's not a head teacher that doesn't want all the kids in school but I would just like people to note that there are 300 adults in our school in a relatively confined space, working together - they can't socially distance from themselves or the kids because of the nature of the work."" Headteacher of Eastern High School in Cardiff Armando Di-Finizio said he was concerned about pupils' wellbeing and academic progress and wanted to see schools open in January as planned. He told BBC Radio Wales: ""I'd be interested to know what the safety issues are with children because when I look at the ONS data, children seem to be completely safe and there's no conclusive evidence either way that they're actually spreading it to adults. ""I know that might sound terrible me saying that but I've not had any conclusive dataâ¦ ""I didn't see a spike when schools first went back and teachers are in classes with 30 pupils every day - surely it would be a lot more cases through pupils to pass it to staff or pupils to pupils but that doesn't doesn't seem to be happening on a grand scale."" Scientists areurgently investigatinghints the new variant of coronavirus spreads more easily in children and say if proven, this could account for ""a significant proportion"" of the increase in transmission. The claim comes from members of the government's New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats advisory group (Nervtag). Children almost universally shrug off the virus, but the variant could alter the role they, and schools, play in spreading the virus. Earlier strains of coronavirus found it harder to infect children than adults. Clare Ferguson Walker, a mother of two from Tavernspite in Pembrokeshire, is also keen for children to return as planned. She said: ""I'll be absolutely honest with you, it is starting to become a complete nightmare home educating the kids. ""At first it almost felt like a kind of novelty and we were managing fine - it was almost like an extended sort of summer holiday period - but it has massively taken its toll on the kids' mental health, on my mental health. ""It's becoming incredibly difficult and I think we are starting to have to ask the question now of the balance between physical safety and actually the mental wellbeing of our kids and the impact of that on families."" The Welsh Government said coronavirus cases ""remain very high in Wales"". A spokeswoman added: ""We are closely monitoring the impact of the decisions we have taken to protect people's health, including the move to alert level four and the decision to provide online learning for the final week of term for secondary school and college students. ""Whilst there are encouraging signs that the package of measures introduced in the weeks before Christmas may have had an impact, this is not the case in every area of Wales.

"This video can not be played Natasha spoke to the BBC in April after coming close to death In April, BBC Wales reported on a student nurse who almost died with Covid-19. In a video of her emotional reunion with her children the then 35-year-old could not walk without a frame. Kate Rimmington spoke to her about what has happened since. Spending three weeks in a coma on a ventilator fighting the virus put an unexpected brake on Natasha Jenkins' second year of nurse training - but it did not put an end to it. In April, a video of herreturning home and hugging her childrenCodie, Elise, and Oakley, then aged 16, 12, and six, was viewed worldwide. It led rock singer Rod Stewart to get in touch with a gift of Â£5,000 to ""help you through the rough times"". Natasha, who had an existing health conditionIdiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH),external, first became ill just before Mother's Day, before being hospitalised in the middle of the night and taken to intensive care. Natasha said she would be forever grateful to the ""amazing staff"" at Cardiff's University Hospital of Wales for saving her life For weeks Natasha's children were looked after by her parents. No-one could say whether the single mum would survive. ""They told my family it was hour by hour,"" she said in April. She got through the worst and returned home to Barry, Vale of Glamorgan, where she faced the task of getting better - and completing her second year of her degree. The course was put on hold for 12 weeks so her fellow students could get to work helping with the deluge of patients caused by the first wave of coronavirus - but Natasha was able to use this time to start her recovery. She was warned this could take six to 12 months, given she was struggling to walk and suffering crippling fatigue. But the pandemic meant much of her degree tuition went online, so she was able to study in bed - with six-year-old Oakley, who had particularly struggled with her absence, glued to her side for two months. Incredibly, she managed to pass the second year at the same time as her peers, and is now in her third year and back training at Cardiff's University Hospital of Wales. ""I was just so determined and I knew I had to put my all into it,"" the former GP receptionist said. New additions Teddy and Bear have accompanied Natasha on her walks to build up her stamina and improve her breathing Eight months on, she is not fully recovered, but is much better. ""I've had loads of follow up. I said to the psychologist, 'I just feel lucky that I'm here'. I count my blessings really. I've really tried to keep a positive mindset. ""My breathing is still affected, my lungs are a bit distended but it's to be expected after what I went through."" Rod Stewart's gift came at the same time as ""amazing support"" from her family, friends and community The family got two dogs to accompany Natasha on her walks to improve her breathing and strengthen her legs, and she has finished her physiotherapy. She still has some problems with her concentration and memory - she is due a neurological check up in the new year - and the virus has affected her knee joints. She also needs a scan on her throat, because doctors think the tracheotomy scar - from the breathing tube that kept her alive - is affecting her voice and ability to clear her throat. The children are doing ""really well"", but after such a ""rubbish year"" they decided to put the Christmas tree up in October for some early festive cheer - and the gift from Rod Stewart is helping to pay for a holiday abroad for them all next year. Natasha is now much better and working up to longer shifts on a surgical ward as she completes her nurse training She was ""gobsmacked"" at his generosity, which had followed ""amazing"" support from her family and friends, and acts of kindness from strangers who left hampers, flowers and chocolates on her doorstep. For now her goal is to qualify. She is currently working on a surgical ward on half shifts spread across the week while she builds her stamina back up, and again has had ""amazing"" help from her colleagues there. She hopes she will be able to manage the full 12-and-a-half hour shifts by May. She said: ""The ITU consultant said 'We don't know if you could get it again. You might have a worse dose.' ""But I've dealt with it. I'm not feeling anxious. The ward staff have been more worried than me. ""I thought either I go back and front it, or waste all my training.""

"Fou studied in Poland and was known for his interpretations of the Polish composer Chopin Fou Ts'ong, the first Chinese pianist to win global acclaim and success, has died aged 86 after contracting Covid-19. Fou died on Monday in London, where he had been living since the 1950s. His death was confirmed to the BBC by Jianing Kong, a professor at the Royal College of Music and student of Fou's. Responding to the news on Tuesday, the renowned Chinese pianist Lang Lang described Fou as ""a truly great pianist, and our spiritual beacon"". Fou was born in China in 1934 to a family of China's intellectual elite. He first heard western classical music at a young age when his father, the renowned translator Fu Lei, returned to China after several years living in France. As a budding pianist, he studied with the founder and head of the Shanghai Symphony Orchestra, Italian conductor Mario Paci, who had been crucial in bringing western classical music to China. Aged 19, Fou left China to continue his musical education in Europe, moving to then-Communist Poland to study in Warsaw. Two years later, he won awards and international recognition at the prestigious Chopin competition in the city. Fou Ts'ong during a recording session in 1964 In 1959, Fou moved to London and grew into an internationally acclaimed soloist, playing both in Europe and the United States, and performing in 1967 at the BBC's First Night of the Proms. In 1960 he had married Zamira Menuhin, the daughter of the renowned violinist Yehudi Menuhin. The couple had a son and divorced in 1969. Fou later married the Chinese pianist Patsy Toh and had another son. While he was living in London, Fou's parents were persecuted in Maoist China during the anti-intellectual Cultural Revolution. They took their own lives in 1966. Allow YouTube content? This article contains content provided by Google YouTube.

Staying true to his earlier training in Poland, Fou became especially known for his interpretations of Chopin. He continued to be associated with the Polish composer, and the Chopin Institute said in a statement on Wednesday that his death marked""the closure of an extremely important page in the Chopin tradition"",external. ""We say goodbye to the master, musician, philosopher who, like no other, was able to tell the world the greatness of Chopin through words, but above all through his play,"" the institute said. French pianist Francois Guy wrote on Twitter thatFou had been his ""mentor and a musical father"",external. ""His Debussy, Chopin and Mozart remain legendary,"" Mr Guy wrote. Fou Ts'ong pictured in London in 1966 Lang Lang wrote on the China's Weibo social media platform on Tuesday that Fou had been a great inspiration for him, recollecting the support he received from the veteran pianist early on in his career. ""I still remember the time when I played Rachmaninov's Piano Concert No. 3 for the first time in London in 2001. After the concert, he gave me a hug with tears in his eyes, and said that he had high hopes for me,"" Lang Lang wrote. ""Master Fou was a great artist that I respected very much. I will never forget what he said about always staying kind and pure-hearted. His understanding of music was unique.""

"The year 2020 has been like no other. The coronavirus infected more than 67 million people, impacted 80% of jobs, and placed billions in lockdown. It's tempting to imagine how 2020 would have turned out differently without a pandemic. What extra time would we have had with loved ones? What birthdays, weddings and milestones did we miss? And while the crisis affected all of us personally, it also shaped news events around the world, with knock-on effects for millions. Here are just four political issues, from four continents, which were altered by the pandemic. The presidential election was meant to look very different. There should have been raucous rallies, and busy trips up and down the campaign trail. Instead, the pandemic meant in-person rallies were delayed, and Joe Biden accepted the Democratic nomination in a near-empty room. Several attendees at a White House event became infected - while the president himself was dramatically flown to hospital after testing positive. Experts believe there are various reasons why Donald Trump lost- but his handling of the pandemic was one of the biggest factors. ""It's clear the impact of the pandemic hurt Trump considerably,"" says Alan Abramowitz, political science professor at Emory College. Mr Trump failed to introduce adequate measures, and ""to some extent discouraged"" public health guidelines like social distancing and mask wearing, he says, turning off enough voters in swing states to tip the balance in Mr Biden's favour. Ironically, Prof Abramowitz adds, people typically rally behind the president in a crisis. ""If Mr Trump had addressed the pandemic seriously and effectively, I think he would have won the election pretty easily."" The pandemic also caused an economic downturn, which typically hurts incumbent presidents. Allan Lichtman, a historian who devised a ""13 keys"" system that correctly predicted each presidential race since 1984, called the 2020 election for Joe Biden in August - on the basis of several factors, including the short-term and long-term economy. ""It was Trump's failed response to the pandemic that resulted in his defeat,"" Prof Lichtman, a professor of history at American University, says.Mr Trump downplayed the pandemicand so failed to contain infections quickly, which ""cost him the short-term economic key and the long-term economic key"". Covid-19 meant the Democratic party moved most of their campaigning online - which may have also helped the Biden campaign. Joe Biden accepted the Democratic nomination in a near-empty room, at a virtual congress ""Biden is memorable for making gaffes and misspeaking,"" says Miles Coleman, associate editor of Sabato's Crystal Ball, a political analysis newsletter at the University of Virginia. The pandemic meant Mr Biden adopted a lower profile - and the election became ""just an up or down vote on Trump"", rather than ""a choice between two candidates"". However, Mr Coleman adds, the fact Republicans continued with traditional in-person campaigning also meant ""Trump gained with non-white voters in rural areas where people may not have the best internet - where you need to go door to door to reach voters."" Finally, Prof Lichtman believes the pandemic also helped drive the highest voter turnout in more than a century. The pandemic ""created a real sense of national emergencyâ¦ I think that convinced American people - both pro-Trump and pro-Biden - that this election was the most critical event of their lifetime."" Five reasons Biden won the election Why Donald Trump lost In 2019, the world was gripped by an unfolding crisis in Hong Kong. The international financial centre saw near-weekly pro-democracy protests, often involving clashes with police, tear gas, and on occasion live bullets being fired. While the demonstrations drew condemnation from Beijing and some businesses, the public largely appeared sympathetic - as shown in local elections in late 2019 wherepro-democracy groups won by a landslide. Yet by 2020, the streets of Hong Kong were mostly quiet, the movement became subdued, and pro-democracy legislators either resigned - or fled the territory altogether. What changed? 2019 v 2020: Images from a Hong Kong gone quiet The pandemic, which hit Hong Kong in January, led to a decline in demonstrations at the start, says Joey Siu, a student activist. ""Hong Kongers are aware of the seriousness of the virus, given that we've had experience of the 2003 Sars outbreak."" However, the first and second waves of the pandemic were contained relatively quickly. The greater impact, analysts argue, came from how the pandemic led to strict public gathering guidelines - which were also used to penalise people at demonstrations. Victoria Hui, a politics professor at Notre Dame University, says the authorities had always wanted to stop the anti-government protests, and ""the pandemic gave the authorities an excuse"" to do so under the guise of public health. Several pro-democracy activists have been fined, and protests banned, under social distancing guidelines. Ms Siu says many had previously been willing to risk taking part in unauthorised demonstrations as there was still ""a chance that we wouldn't get arrested, and a chance we could win at court"". ""But now, with the public gathering ban, police are able to prosecute anybody who seems to be taking part in a pro-democracy protest, and fine you HK$2,000 ($260; Â£190)."" The government says its regulations are based on science, and needed to prevent infections. An annual candlelit vigil commemorating the Tiananmen massacre was among those banned amid coronavirus restrictions Then there were two major developments - the imposition of a sweeping national security law, and the postponement of parliamentary elections - that are widely seen to have restricted Hong Kong's pro-democracy movement. The national security law made ""inciting hatred"" of the government, calling on countries to impose sanctions on Chinese officials, or usingcertain protest slogans, offences punishable by life imprisonment. Beijing has long said that such a law is needed to protect Hong Kong's integrity - but some argue that the timing of the law, which was finally introduced in May, was ""fundamentally shaped by Covid-19"". ""Beijing calculated that the rest of the world would be preoccupied,"" says Prof Hui. The impact of the legislation was instant. Some pro-democracy groups disbanded, and shops took down posters supporting protesters. Activists became much, much more afraid to protest, says Ms Siu. Supporters of the legislation, however, arguedit was needed to restore stabilityafter a year of often violent protests. This video can not be played Hong Kong's Ronny Tong defends new security law A month later, amid a third wave of infections, the government announced that legislative elections would be postponed by a year - despite some health experts saying it was still possible to hold polls safely. The government said the postponement was necessary given the ""immense infection risk"", and dozens of other elections around the world had also been delayed. However, rights groups believed it was a political move, as pro-democracy groups had been hoping to win a majority in parliament. In subsequent months,several other pro-democracy politicians were charged by police, or disqualified altogether. In November, all of Hong Kong's pro-democracy lawmakers resigned in protest - leaving the legislature with almost no dissenting voices for the first time ever. Can Hong Kong's democracy fight survive the walkout? The city of two masks faces a new crisis Hong Kong's dying news stands tell a story of change Many outside of Africa had not heard of Tigray, a region in northern Ethiopia, before 2020. But in November, a conflict erupted between the Ethiopian government and the regional party, the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF) - leading to reports of hundreds dead, and more than 40,000 people fleeing into neighbouring Sudan.There had been fears the fighting could have destabilised the entire region. One of the triggers for the crisis was the way the government handled the constitutional crisis that emerged after national elections were postponed due to Covid-19. ""The postponement of elections is one of the fundamental causes of this war,"" says Tsedale Lemma, editor-in-chief of the Addis Standard. Under new Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed, Ethiopia had committed to democratic reforms in 2018. The national elections scheduled for August 2020 were the first opportunity for most opposition groups to compete, ""after decades of absence from the political space"", she says. ""Everyone was excited."" ""There were a lot of political tensions between rival groups, and although some had expressed concerns about possible post-election violenceâ¦ people had hope that the elections would settle tensions."" When the pandemic hit in March, the electoral commission's initial decision to postpone the vote was accepted by most opposition groups. However, it also sparked a constitutional crisis as the government's term was due to end in September. The government failed to compromise with opposition parties about what should happen next, says Ms Tsedale. Instead, a partisan legal council made the decision to extend the government's term and postpone elections indefinitely until the pandemic was over - and this was voted through by parliament's upper house, which is completely controlled by the ruling party, she adds. This meant the government lost legitimacy with its rivals. The crisis has forced more than 40,000 people from their homes Comfort Ero, Africa programme director at the International Crisis Group, says ""the pandemic and the decision around elections added more fuel to what was already a combustible situation."" Ethiopia was already in a ""fragile transition"", with tensions between the government and the regions, and threats of communal violence, she says. The opposition saw the postponement of elections ""as another example of the prime minister not consulting with his rivals and acting unilaterally"". In response, the TPLF - which already had long-standing tensions with Mr Abiy - held its own regional elections on 9 September, in defiance of the federal government. ""That was the straw that broke the camel's back - the TPLF no longer recognised the central government, while the federal government refused to recognise the TPLF - they entered a phase of mutual delegitimisation and after that, war was a matter of when, not if,"" says Ms Tsedale. Ethiopian troops captured Tigray's capital in late November, declaring victory - but fighting has continued in parts of the region and the UN has warned of ""an appalling impact on civilians"". The conflict is ""a tragic, sad outcome... we missed a golden opportunity of building politics built on consensus,"" Ms Tsedale says. 'How we survived when our city was shelled' 'I survived an 11-hour gun battle' Crisis has engulfed Ethiopia. Hereâs what it means In April, political observers began saying thatthe pandemic had ""saved"" Benjamin Netanyahu's political career,external. Mr Netanyahu had just been sworn in for a fifth term as prime minister, in a unity government with his rival Benny Gantz. The country had been in a state of political limbo for almost a year - despite holding three elections between 2019 and 2020 - as no bloc had enough seats to form a ruling coalition. In fact, in the most recent, March elections,Mr Gantz was invited to form a government first,external, as he had a slim majority of MPs backing him, united by the goal of ousting Mr Netanyahu. However, the opposition ""had difficulty forming a government because they came from a very wide range of parties - from right-wing nationalists to left-wing communists,"" says Anshel Pfeffer, a commentator for Haaretz newspaper. Then the pandemic arrived, while Mr Netanyahu was still acting as caretaker leader. ""People suddenly felt there was a state of emergency, and Netanyahu took charge of Covid policy, saying he was the only person leading the country in an emergency,"" Mr Pfeffer says. ""The pandemic came at the best possible political timing for Netanyahu - it certainly helped put more pressure on Gantz to join him."" Mr Gantz, who had vowed never to sit in government with Mr Netanyahu as prime minister, defended his U-turn, saying ""these are not normal times"". Under the terms of the unity government, Mr Netanyahu and Mr Gantz would rotate as prime minister, with Mr Netanyahu going first. The agreement was seen by many as a victory for Mr Netanyahu, who had defied opponents' calls to step down after being charged with corruption months earlier. He denies accusations of bribery, fraud and breach of trust. Protesters have rallied against Mr Netanyahu's alleged corruption and handling of the pandemic The pandemic brought Mr Netanyahu breathing space, says Tal Schneider, diplomatic correspondent at Globes. ""The entire problem behind the scenes is the criminal trial - he just looks to gain more time."" By contrast, she added, Mr Gantz no longer posed a political threat because he was seen as having ""cheated his voters"" and his base by joining Mr Netanyahu in government. And the unity government did not stay united for long - just eight months later, it collapsed amid a row over state budgets. Israeli voters will have their fourth electionin two years in March, and Mr Netanyahu has vowed to return with a ""huge win"".

"Queen's Hospital in Romford, Essex, said some Covid patients are being cared for in ambulances outside the hospital as London's NHS faces ""significant pressure"" A surge in coronavirus cases in the UK is of ""extreme concern"", a health boss says, as a record number of cases was reported for the second day running. On Tuesday, 53,135new Covid cases were recorded,externalas well as 414 more deaths within 28 days of a positive test. Not all data was reported in full over the Christmas period, leading to a lag in some data, but Public Health England said there had been a ""real increase"". The health secretary said the NHS was facing ""unprecedented pressures"". Ahead of an announcement on any changes to England's tier restrictions on Wednesday,Matt Hancock added in a tweet,external: ""We must suppress this virus to protect our NHS & save lives until the vaccine can keep us safe."" Hospitals in England and Wales are now treating more Covid patients than at the peak of the first wave in April. Hospital staff asked to cancel holidays What are the lockdown and tier four rules? New coronavirus variant: What do we know? Dr Susan Hopkins, senior medical adviser at PHE, said: ""We are continuing to see unprecedented levels of Covid-19 infection across the UK, which is of extreme concern, particularly as our hospitals are at their most vulnerable. ""Whilst the number of cases reported today include some from over the festive period, these figures are largely a reflection of a real increase."" Dr Hopkins said it was ""essential, now more than ever"" that people follow social distancing rules to help drive infections down and protect the NHS and vulnerable people. It comesa day after more than 40,000 daily virus cases were announced for the first timein the UK, although it is thought infection rates were higher earlier in the year, before mass testing. In Wales' Brecon Beacons beauty spot, police have had to turn awayvisitors from as far away as London- which is under ""stay at home"" tier four rules. People in Scotland have been urged to stay at homeand not celebrate Hogmanay with other households. And in Northern Ireland a top doctor has warneda third surge of Covid cases is expected in mid-January, in part driven by the spread of a new coronavirus variant. There is no shying away from these very big, record-breaking figures and the strain they put on the NHS. Many hospitals in the UK are already caring for more people with Covid than during the first wave and the situation looks set to get worse, not better - at least in the short term. New infections are rising rapidly, which will pile on even more pressure on busy wards in the coming weeks. Although much of the UK has introduced tougher Covid restrictions, it is not clear yet if they will be enough to help drive infections down, or at least hold them at manageable levels. There is a new variant of Covid that has been spreading more readily, which complicates things. And we are yet to see what the permitted (and banned) Christmas socialising will do to the figures. The NHS is coping and open for business, but medics fear it being tested to breaking point. A scientist advising the government has said ""decisive"" national action is needed to tackle the spread of the virus across the UK and prevent a ""catastrophe"" in the new year. Prof Andrew Hayward, a member of the government's New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group (Nervtag), said the new variant meant the UK was entering ""a very dangerous new phase of the pandemic"". He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the ""50% increase in transmissibility"" of the new variant means restrictions that worked before ""won't work now"" so England's tier four restrictions, ""or even higher than that"", were likely to be needed. ""I think we're really looking at a situation where we're moving into near lockdown,"" he added. Tier four - England's toughest level of coronavirus restrictions, currently in place in parts of east and south-east England - includes a ""stay at home"" order and the closure of non-essential shops. Prof Hayward, a professor of infectious disease epidemiology at University College London, said he thought schools would have to return ""maybe a little bit later"" but that having schools open would mean ""we're going to have to have increased, strict restrictions in other areas of society to pay for that"". The prime minister's official spokesman said the government was ""still planning for a staggered opening"" of secondary schools after Christmas but it was keeping this under constant review. Members of the armed forces will be on standbyto help roll out mass testing to secondary schools and colleges in England from next month. Another epidemiologist and member of Nervtag, Prof Neil Ferguson, said the new coronavirus variant had ""undoubtedly"" made the situation ""considerably more difficult"". He told BBC Radio 4's The World at One programme that it had given the government ""even less wiggle room"" in trying to keep control of the virus while maintaining ""some semblance of normal society"". Preliminary research released on Tuesday suggestedthe new variant of the virus was no more harmful in terms of causing hospitalisations and deaths.,external Researchers found no significant difference in terms of mortality or morbidity when they compared 1,769 people infected with the new variant versus 1,769 who had ""regular"" or ""wild type"" of Covid.

"This video can not be played The earthquake caused extensive damage in Petrinja and Zagreb At least seven people are known to have died in a magnitude 6.4 earthquake that struck central Croatia on Tuesday. Rescue teams spent the night scouring the rubble of damaged buildings in the search for survivors. A 12-year-old girl was killed in Petrinja, the prime minister said as he visited the town. Five people died in the nearby town of Glina, his deputy said. A seventh victim was found in the rubble of a church in Zazina, state media reports. Petrinja's mayor said that about half the town had been destroyed and people had been pulled from the rubble. Many were too afraid to return to their homes overnight in case aftershocks caused more damage, officials said. Some people slept in their cars or stayed with relatives in other areas. About 200 people sheltered in a military barracks. EU crisis management chief Janez Lenarcic is due to visit Petrinja on Wednesday. The search for survivors continued overnight The earthquake was felt in the Croatian capital Zagreb, in neighbouring Bosnia and Serbia, and as far away as Italy. One woman was pulled alive from the rubble of the town hall in Petrinja on Tuesday, Croatian media reported. Some of the injured were evacuated to Zagreb ""We are pulling people from the cars, we don't know if we have dead or injured,"" Darinko Dumbovic, the mayor of Petrinja, told regional broadcaster N1 on Tuesday. ""There is general panic, people are looking for their loved ones."" The mayor was speaking to reporters when Petrinja, home to 20,000 people, was hit by another, weaker, tremor.

""Even if we wanted to, we can't go back in, there is no electricity."" People were also injured in the nearby town of Sisak. National broadcaster HRT said the local hospital there was struggling to cope with the number of casualties arriving for treatment. Some displaced people have been forced to sleep at a military base Tomislav Fabijanic, head of emergency medical services in Sisak, said they were seeing fractures and concussions, and some people had needed surgery. The GFZ German Research Centre for Geosciences reported that the earthquake struck at 11:19 GMT at a depth of 10km (6 miles). The second tremor followed an hour or so later. The Croatian Mountain Rescue Service said that rescuers from across Croatia had travelled to Petrinja to help with the search and recovery effort. Allow Twitter content?

Prime Minister Andrej Plenkovic, who rushed to Petrinja, said: ""The army is here to help. We will have to move some people from Petrinja because it is unsafe to be here,"" he added. Croatia's president and prime minister saw for themselves the scale of damage in Petrinja within two hours of the earthquake and were united in their response. President Zoran Milanovic compared the scene to Grozny, the capital of the the Russian republic of Chechnya, which was largely destroyed during a siege 20 years ago. The prime minister said it was ""clear as day"" that Petrinja was no longer safe for human habitation. Petrinja is home to some 20,000 residents and the prime minister said it was now unsafe to live in It is a bitter blow for the town's people, who faced a significant rebuilding operation after Croatia's war of independence in the 1990s. More recently, they have been tackling economic devastation, with the decline of traditional industries. Croatia's leaders have promised funds for reconstruction. But Petrinja's residents will be seeing in the new year in temporary accommodation - with little prospect of an early return home. A kindergarten also collapsed in Petrinja, but it was empty at the time of the quake. In a village just outside Petrinja, a worker told N1 that nine of its 10 houses were destroyed. Slovenia has moved to close the Krsko nuclear power plant it co-owns with Croatia. The US Geological Survey said it was the largest earthquake to occur in Croatia since the introduction of modern seismic instrumentation. An earthquake of similar size occurred in 1880 near Zagreb. A magnitude 5.2 earthquake hit central Croatia on Monday and there are fears of more. Branko Dragicevic of the Serbian seismological institute told the BBC: ""We can expect further quakes.""

"China has celebrated victory over the coronavirus this year At the start of the year the Chinese government faced two major challenges; an unknown disease which threatened to tear through its population and a wave of voices online telling the world what was happening. By the end of 2020, a glance at Chinese state-controlled media shows that both appear to be under control. The BBC's Kerry Allen and Zhaoyin Feng take a look back at the country's online government censors who worked harder than ever to supress negative information, the citizens that managed to break through the Great Firewall, and how the propaganda machine re-wrote the narrative. Comments appeared over and over again on Weibo asking if China was experiencing another Sars outbreak At the beginning of the year, it was clear something unprecedented was happening. Thousands of messages of public outrage appeared on Chinese social media, asking whether local governments were covering up another Sars-like virus. While government censors routinely mute anti-government messaging on platforms like Sina Weibo, they were of such a large volume that many remained visible. This is because when facing major disasters, the Chinese government often scrambles to react, and censors are slow to act. In January and February, multiple media outlets took the opportunity to publish hard-hitting investigations, which were widely shared on social media. Later, as Beijing came up with a propaganda strategy, these reports were stifled. China social media censorship: how does it work? How the Chinese authorities censor your thoughts The top talking points of 2019 in China and how netizens evaded the censors Blame was being pointed in all directions. In mid-January, Chinese President Xi Jinping suddenly became an absent figure in China's media. He was not seen in public, and pictures vanished of him from the front pages of traditional government outlets like People's Daily. There was some speculation that he was, quite physically, avoiding blame. Images of Xi Jinping normally dominate China's government mouthpiece and he became notably absent Within a week, however, things changed considerably. Top officials began warning local governments they would""forever be nailed to the pillar of historical shame""if they withheld information about cases in their regions. Blame shifted in Chinese media and social media towards Wuhan's leadership, with papers like Beijing News writing unusually critical commentaries, asking:""Why didn't Wuhan let the public know sooner?"",external Mr Xi then reappeared in early February as a pillar of confidence and strength amid China's recovery. Regional dailies criticised Wuhan officials for outbreaks elsewhere, like here in Shanghai More than 1m Weibo users have left comments on Li Wenliang's Weibo page since his death Amid all the confusion, it became clear that one man's voice had been silenced where it shouldn't have been. Li Wenliang has become known internationally as the ""whistleblower"" doctor who tried to warn colleagues about a Sars-like virus.Dr Li died on 7 Februaryafter it came to light that he had been investigated for ""disturbing social order"" by ""making false comments"". More than a million users took to Sina Weibo to leavemessages of support for him on his profile,externalafter his death, which many termed China's ""Wailing Wall"". However,posts have been periodically wiped,to people's frustration. Netizens have, however, found creative ways to keep his memory alive usingemojis, Morse code, and ancient Chinese script,external. Users voiced their anger about Dr Li's death with mask protests A trend appeared on both Facebook and the popular WeChat messaging app of users writing words on their masks in response to Dr Li's death. Many wrote ""I cannot"" and ""I do not understand"" - a reference to how Dr Li was interrogated by police, who had asked him: ""Can you do it?"" and ""Do you understand?"" when warning him to stop ""making false comments"". While the authorities have since officially recognised Dr Li Wenliang as a ""martyr"", several notable activists may be written out of the country's Covid-19 history. Citizen journalist Zhang Zhan was imprisoned for reporting from Wuhan During the Wuhan outbreak, a number of citizen journalists made a notable impact internationally, by circumventing the ""great firewall of China"" to get word out of the city. These includeChen Qiushi, Fang Bin and Zhang Zhan. They racked up hundreds of thousands of views on YouTube for videos they say gave the true picture of what was happening in Wuhan. However, this came at a cost. The Committee to Protect Journalists notes that in Wuhan, the authorities""arrested several journalists for coverage that threatened the official narrative of Beijing's response"",external. CPJ says three are still in prison. And given YouTube is blocked in China, few in the country know of their impact. Questions have also been raised about whether one journalist who did reappear became part of an overseas propaganda campaign. Li Zehua went missing for two months after last being seen in Wuhan Li Zehua vanished in February after posting a YouTube video saying he was being chased in his car by police. He wasn't heard from for two months, but then posted a video saying that he had been cooperating with the authorities and had been in quarantine. He has not posted since, and many have suggested that he might have been forced into making the video. Students shouted from their dorms in protest at being locked down at universities across the country Since March, China has wanted to mark its success in overcoming the coronavirus, yet it has been especially evident that the censors have tried to stamp out evidence of discontent, particularly among young people. China has stressed that it wants to avoid another Wuhan-style lockdown. Yet as the South China Morning Post notes, many universities have continued to implement""blanket campus lockdowns"",external. In August, many students returned to a physical classroom for the first time. But protests erupted at campuses across the country to universities rationing internet and showering times, due to the sudden overcapacity. There were also complaints that university canteens exploited the reliance on on-site food and hiked food costs. Many such conversations were subsequently censored. Anger and dissatisfaction among China's young caused many this year to go beyond traditional social media platforms onto lesser known ones, to find a shared voice. Memes about Chinese going ""NetEmo"" unsettled the government News website Sixth Tone notes a surge of ""NetEmo"" on music streaming platform, Netease Cloud Music, with ""pervasive"" comments from young Chinese about""failed exams, doomed relationships and shattered dreams"",external. It says the platform tried to ""stem the trend"", by announcing a crackdown on what it said were ""fabricated"" user comments. China has also tried to promote an overly optimistic picture. Much as there have been concerns that The Crown might tell an inauthentic version of the UK's royal history, many Chinese are concerned that post-Covid era books and TV programmes have not accurately shown what happened in Wuhan. Fang Fang, once an online star, is now accused of spreading a ""doomsday narrative"" Chinese author Fang Fang received widespread praise earlier in the year for documenting her life in Wuhan, and providing a rare glimpse into Wuhan residents' fears and hopes. However, her online diary has since made her the target of fervent Chinese nationalists, who accuse her of trying to smear China and promote a""doomsday narrative"",external. State media have sought to promote other books,including those of expats,,externalto reinforce the government's optimistic message about the authorities' handling of the virus. In some instances, there has been backlash at state media dictating a certain narrative on the handling of the Wuhan outbreak. This was evident in September when Heroes in Harm's Way, the first drama ""based on real life stories"" of front-line workers, received backlash fordownplaying the role that women had played in the outbreak. Women were angry with one drama's depiction of their pandemic role It is evident that China wants to end 2020 on a high note. Beyond telling its own citizens that it has largely won the war over its Covid-19, China also wants to tell the world. But China now seeks to distance itself from its early connections to the coronavirus, and promote the idea that China's Covid-19 success means its political model is more successful than the West's.

This has gone beyond calling for an end to loaded terminology, like the ""Wuhan coronavirus"" - which China's own media even used in the early stages - to stepping up suggestions that the coronaviruscould actually have started in the West,external. Chinese outlets have wasted no opportunity throughout the year to highlight the United States - and to some extent the UK's - poor handling of the virus, and how these have exacerbated divisions. This has happened to such an extent that it has become popular for Chinese netizens to call Covid-19 the ""America virus"" or ""Trump virus"". Chinese papers and broadcasters have been keen to point out when US media have turned on each other, how politicians have prioritised spending on election campaigns over healthcare, and how a messy, endless election has led to extreme political polarisation. If there's one message China wants to take into 2021, it's that the country is rounding off the year with unity and prosperity, whereas other countries can only anticipate further divisions and instability.

"London's Nightingale hospital was built in nine days, with the help of hundreds of soldiers London's Nightingale hospital remains on standby, despite the removal of some of its equipment, NHS England has said. England's hospitalsare currently treating more Covid-19 patientsthan during the previous peak of the virus in April. Some equipment, including beds and ventilators, are no longer at the ExCel Centre site, it is understood. NHS England said the facility would be available to support the capital's hospitals if needed. It sent a letter to trusts on 23 December asking them to plan for the use of additional facilities such as the Nightingale hospitals. The ExCel Centre site, which opened on 3 April with space for 4,000 beds to treat Covid-19 patients,was placed on standby in Maywhen fewer than 20 patients were being treated there. Will virus variant force the Nightingales to open? Health workers 'back in eye of storm' How the UK's newest hospital was built in nine days A spokesperson for the NHS said: ""The Nightingale in London remains on standby and will be available to support the capital's hospitals if needed. ""In the meantime it is vital that Londoners do everything possible to reduce transmission and cut the number of new infections which otherwise inevitably result in more avoidable deaths."" However, concerns have been raised about the already-stretched NHS's ability to staff Nightingale facilities. Dr Nick Scriven, the former president of the Society for Acute Medicine, said: ""It is not 'just the case' of using the Nightingale hospital as there are simply no staff for them to run as they were originally intended. ""They could play a role perhaps if used as rehabilitation units for those recovering but, again, where do we find the specialist staff - the NHS simply does not have the capacity to spare anyone."" Shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth said the Nightingale hospitals had been opened ""at great expense and fanfare"". The Labour MP tweeted: ""But the reality is years of Tory failures to invest in training and staffing has left NHS short of staff needed."" Officials, including Health Secretary Matt Hancock, were at the opening of the hospital on 3 April Despite the problems, Chris Hopson of NHS Providers, which represents hospital trusts, said it was still the right decision to build the hospitals earlier this year. Even without complex equipment, they could still have a role given many Covid-19 patients are now treated on general wards with oxygen therapy, he said. He said the NHS would use ""every ounce"" of existing capacity it could muster before the Nightingales were used routinely. The hospital, which was formerly a large exhibition space in London's Docklands, was planned as part of the UK's response to the coronavirus pandemic. There are other Nightingale hospitals in Birmingham, Manchester, Bristol, Exeter, Sunderland and Harrogate.

"Queen's Hospital in Romford, Essex, said some Covid patients are being cared for in ambulances outside the hospital as London's NHS faces ""significant pressure"" A surge in coronavirus cases in the UK is of ""extreme concern"", a health boss says, as a record number of cases was reported for the second day running. On Tuesday, 53,135new Covid cases were recorded,externalas well as 414 more deaths within 28 days of a positive test. Not all data was reported in full over the Christmas period, leading to a lag in some data, but Public Health England said there had been a ""real increase"". The health secretary said the NHS was facing ""unprecedented pressures"". Ahead of an announcement on any changes to England's tier restrictions on Wednesday,Matt Hancock added in a tweet,external: ""We must suppress this virus to protect our NHS & save lives until the vaccine can keep us safe."" Hospitals in England and Wales are now treating more Covid patients than at the peak of the first wave in April. Hospital staff asked to cancel holidays What are the lockdown and tier four rules? New coronavirus variant: What do we know? Dr Susan Hopkins, senior medical adviser at PHE, said: ""We are continuing to see unprecedented levels of Covid-19 infection across the UK, which is of extreme concern, particularly as our hospitals are at their most vulnerable. ""Whilst the number of cases reported today include some from over the festive period, these figures are largely a reflection of a real increase."" Dr Hopkins said it was ""essential, now more than ever"" that people follow social distancing rules to help drive infections down and protect the NHS and vulnerable people. It comesa day after more than 40,000 daily virus cases were announced for the first timein the UK, although it is thought infection rates were higher earlier in the year, before mass testing. In Wales' Brecon Beacons beauty spot, police have had to turn awayvisitors from as far away as London- which is under ""stay at home"" tier four rules. People in Scotland have been urged to stay at homeand not celebrate Hogmanay with other households. And in Northern Ireland a top doctor has warneda third surge of Covid cases is expected in mid-January, in part driven by the spread of a new coronavirus variant. There is no shying away from these very big, record-breaking figures and the strain they put on the NHS. Many hospitals in the UK are already caring for more people with Covid than during the first wave and the situation looks set to get worse, not better - at least in the short term. New infections are rising rapidly, which will pile on even more pressure on busy wards in the coming weeks. Although much of the UK has introduced tougher Covid restrictions, it is not clear yet if they will be enough to help drive infections down, or at least hold them at manageable levels. There is a new variant of Covid that has been spreading more readily, which complicates things. And we are yet to see what the permitted (and banned) Christmas socialising will do to the figures. The NHS is coping and open for business, but medics fear it being tested to breaking point. A scientist advising the government has said ""decisive"" national action is needed to tackle the spread of the virus across the UK and prevent a ""catastrophe"" in the new year. Prof Andrew Hayward, a member of the government's New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group (Nervtag), said the new variant meant the UK was entering ""a very dangerous new phase of the pandemic"". He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the ""50% increase in transmissibility"" of the new variant means restrictions that worked before ""won't work now"" so England's tier four restrictions, ""or even higher than that"", were likely to be needed. ""I think we're really looking at a situation where we're moving into near lockdown,"" he added. Tier four - England's toughest level of coronavirus restrictions, currently in place in parts of east and south-east England - includes a ""stay at home"" order and the closure of non-essential shops. Prof Hayward, a professor of infectious disease epidemiology at University College London, said he thought schools would have to return ""maybe a little bit later"" but that having schools open would mean ""we're going to have to have increased, strict restrictions in other areas of society to pay for that"". The prime minister's official spokesman said the government was ""still planning for a staggered opening"" of secondary schools after Christmas but it was keeping this under constant review. Members of the armed forces will be on standbyto help roll out mass testing to secondary schools and colleges in England from next month. Another epidemiologist and member of Nervtag, Prof Neil Ferguson, said the new coronavirus variant had ""undoubtedly"" made the situation ""considerably more difficult"". He told BBC Radio 4's The World at One programme that it had given the government ""even less wiggle room"" in trying to keep control of the virus while maintaining ""some semblance of normal society"". Preliminary research released on Tuesday suggestedthe new variant of the virus was no more harmful in terms of causing hospitalisations and deaths.,external Researchers found no significant difference in terms of mortality or morbidity when they compared 1,769 people infected with the new variant versus 1,769 who had ""regular"" or ""wild type"" of Covid. Military offers remote support for pupil testing Covid hospital pressures 'incredibly challenging' NHS faces being 'overwhelmed' warn health leaders Hospitals in Wales, Scotland and the south of England have reported rising pressure on their services as the number of Covid patients increases, with health officials warning they are at risk of becoming overwhelmed. Southend University Hospital in Essexhas asked staff to cancel holidaysto help treat its high number of Covid patients. Emergency medicine consultant Simon Walsh, who works in north-east London, said staff were working in ""major incident mode"" in many hospital trusts across south-east England. He said they were dealing with ""queues of ambulances outside many emergency departments"" and some were considering setting up triage tents - normally reserved for major incidents like terror attacks - outside hospitals. Staff at Queen's Hospital in Romford, east London, are being encouraged to take on additional shifts, and some Covid patients are being cared for in ambulances outside the hospital. The hospital's chief medical officer, Magda Smith, said London's NHS was under ""significant pressure"" and ""we are opening more beds to care for the most unwell patients"". This video can not be played ""Now is the right time... to record our enormous debt of gratitude,"" says NHS England boss Sir Simon Stevens Prof Steve Hams, chief nurse at Gloucestershire Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, said patient numbers were becoming ""increasingly challenging"" and staff were becoming ""increasingly exhausted"". In a new year message to staff recorded at a vaccination centre, NHS England chief executive Sir Simon Stevens said Covid-19 meant 2020 had probably been ""the toughest year most of us can remember"". He said the ""the biggest chink of hope"" for 2021 was that by late spring he expected the NHS to have offered vaccinations to all vulnerable people.

First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said it was ""especially vital"" people did not mix indoors with other households. The near 2,000 cases reported on Tuesday was double the number logged on Monday, with 14.4% of tests returning a positive result.

Shetland 'set for level 4' if Covid cases rise Confirmed Covid cases in Scotland pass 120,000 She said the new strain of Covid-19 was ""contributing to faster spread"" of the virus, with a rising trend across the country and particular concerns over Shetland and the south of Scotland. The first minister said: ""The main message to people is to make sure you are not visiting other people's houses just now. Unfortunately that includes Hogmanay and New Year. ""This is a time of year I know people enjoy getting together, but that's not safe to do this year. ""As we head into the Hogmanay and new year period I really do appeal to people to stay out of the homes of others, celebrate new year in your own home only with your own household."" A further seven deaths of patients who had tested positive for Covid-19 in the last 28 days were also reported on Tuesday, although registration offices were closed over the festive break and the publication of most figures has been delayed. As of Tuesday there were 1,092 people in hospital with a recently-confirmed case of the virus, with 65 in intensive care. The whole of mainland Scotland has been in level four - the top tier of measures - since Boxing Day, and will remain there for at least three weeks. Officials are also considering on a daily basis whether to escalate restrictions on Scotland's islands, which are currently in level three. Ms Sturgeon said the situation in Shetland in particular was being ""very clearly monitored"". She also said there were concerns about ""quite significant increases"" in cases in Dumfries and Galloway and the Borders. MSPs are to be given an update on the latest situation on Wednesday, when the Scottish Parliament is being recalled from recess to debate the Brexit deal.

"Queen's Hospital in Romford, Essex, said some Covid patients are being cared for in ambulances outside the hospital as London's NHS faces ""significant pressure"" A surge in coronavirus cases in the UK is of ""extreme concern"", a health boss says, as a record number of cases was reported for the second day running. On Tuesday, 53,135new Covid cases were recorded,externalas well as 414 more deaths within 28 days of a positive test. Not all data was reported in full over the Christmas period, leading to a lag in some data, but Public Health England said there had been a ""real increase"". The health secretary said the NHS was facing ""unprecedented pressures"". Ahead of an announcement on any changes to England's tier restrictions on Wednesday,Matt Hancock added in a tweet,external: ""We must suppress this virus to protect our NHS & save lives until the vaccine can keep us safe."" Hospitals in England and Wales are now treating more Covid patients than at the peak of the first wave in April. Hospital staff asked to cancel holidays What are the lockdown and tier four rules? New coronavirus variant: What do we know? Dr Susan Hopkins, senior medical adviser at PHE, said: ""We are continuing to see unprecedented levels of Covid-19 infection across the UK, which is of extreme concern, particularly as our hospitals are at their most vulnerable. ""Whilst the number of cases reported today include some from over the festive period, these figures are largely a reflection of a real increase."" Dr Hopkins said it was ""essential, now more than ever"" that people follow social distancing rules to help drive infections down and protect the NHS and vulnerable people. It comesa day after more than 40,000 daily virus cases were announced for the first timein the UK, although it is thought infection rates were higher earlier in the year, before mass testing. In Wales' Brecon Beacons beauty spot, police have had to turn awayvisitors from as far away as London- which is under ""stay at home"" tier four rules. People in Scotland have been urged to stay at homeand not celebrate Hogmanay with other households. And in Northern Ireland a top doctor has warneda third surge of Covid cases is expected in mid-January, in part driven by the spread of a new coronavirus variant. There is no shying away from these very big, record-breaking figures and the strain they put on the NHS. Many hospitals in the UK are already caring for more people with Covid than during the first wave and the situation looks set to get worse, not better - at least in the short term. New infections are rising rapidly, which will pile on even more pressure on busy wards in the coming weeks. Although much of the UK has introduced tougher Covid restrictions, it is not clear yet if they will be enough to help drive infections down, or at least hold them at manageable levels. There is a new variant of Covid that has been spreading more readily, which complicates things. And we are yet to see what the permitted (and banned) Christmas socialising will do to the figures. The NHS is coping and open for business, but medics fear it being tested to breaking point. A scientist advising the government has said ""decisive"" national action is needed to tackle the spread of the virus across the UK and prevent a ""catastrophe"" in the new year. Prof Andrew Hayward, a member of the government's New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group (Nervtag), said the new variant meant the UK was entering ""a very dangerous new phase of the pandemic"". He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the ""50% increase in transmissibility"" of the new variant means restrictions that worked before ""won't work now"" so England's tier four restrictions, ""or even higher than that"", were likely to be needed. ""I think we're really looking at a situation where we're moving into near lockdown,"" he added. Tier four - England's toughest level of coronavirus restrictions, currently in place in parts of east and south-east England - includes a ""stay at home"" order and the closure of non-essential shops. Prof Hayward, a professor of infectious disease epidemiology at University College London, said he thought schools would have to return ""maybe a little bit later"" but that having schools open would mean ""we're going to have to have increased, strict restrictions in other areas of society to pay for that"". The prime minister's official spokesman said the government was ""still planning for a staggered opening"" of secondary schools after Christmas but it was keeping this under constant review. Members of the armed forces will be on standbyto help roll out mass testing to secondary schools and colleges in England from next month. Another epidemiologist and member of Nervtag, Prof Neil Ferguson, said the new coronavirus variant had ""undoubtedly"" made the situation ""considerably more difficult"". He told BBC Radio 4's The World at One programme that it had given the government ""even less wiggle room"" in trying to keep control of the virus while maintaining ""some semblance of normal society"". Preliminary research released on Tuesday suggestedthe new variant of the virus was no more harmful in terms of causing hospitalisations and deaths.,external Researchers found no significant difference in terms of mortality or morbidity when they compared 1,769 people infected with the new variant versus 1,769 who had ""regular"" or ""wild type"" of Covid. Military offers remote support for pupil testing Covid hospital pressures 'incredibly challenging' NHS faces being 'overwhelmed' warn health leaders Hospitals in Wales, Scotland and the south of England have reported rising pressure on their services as the number of Covid patients increases, with health officials warning they are at risk of becoming overwhelmed. Southend University Hospital in Essexhas asked staff to cancel holidaysto help treat its high number of Covid patients. Emergency medicine consultant Simon Walsh, who works in north-east London, said staff were working in ""major incident mode"" in many hospital trusts across south-east England. He said they were dealing with ""queues of ambulances outside many emergency departments"" and some were considering setting up triage tents - normally reserved for major incidents like terror attacks - outside hospitals. Staff at Queen's Hospital in Romford, east London, are being encouraged to take on additional shifts, and some Covid patients are being cared for in ambulances outside the hospital. The hospital's chief medical officer, Magda Smith, said London's NHS was under ""significant pressure"" and ""we are opening more beds to care for the most unwell patients"". This video can not be played ""Now is the right time... to record our enormous debt of gratitude,"" says NHS England boss Sir Simon Stevens Prof Steve Hams, chief nurse at Gloucestershire Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, said patient numbers were becoming ""increasingly challenging"" and staff were becoming ""increasingly exhausted"". In a new year message to staff recorded at a vaccination centre, NHS England chief executive Sir Simon Stevens said Covid-19 meant 2020 had probably been ""the toughest year most of us can remember"". He said the ""the biggest chink of hope"" for 2021 was that by late spring he expected the NHS to have offered vaccinations to all vulnerable people.

"Members of the armed forces are to give remote support to secondary schools and colleges in England setting up mass Covid testing as the new term begins. Military personnel will hold webinars and give phone support to school staff. But head teachers say they need support on the ground and more time to make the plan workable. They are calling for a delay to the start of term. The government wants pupils to go back in the first two weeks of January, but is keeping the situation under review. What is happening with schools in January? Impact of new variant on children investigated Will schools be closed next term by variant of virus? How does mass testing work? Under the current plans, the majority of secondary school pupils in England are due to start term on 4 January studying remotely, to give head teachers time to implement a round of coronavirus testing for students and staff. Primary school students will return as normal during the same week and will not be tested for Covid-19. Those in exam years and vulnerable pupils will return in person first, with the rest expected to go back on 11 January. But this entails 5.5 million secondary pupils being tested in schools in the space of a week. Several media reports suggest ministers are considering delaying the start of term, with potentially only exam year pupils starting remotely in the first week of January. In response to the reports, a spokesman for the Department for Education said: ""We want all pupils to return in January as school is the best place for their development and mental health. ""But as the prime minister has said, it is right that we follow the path of the pandemic and keep our approach under constant review."" It added that funds had been made available for schools to hire staff from employment agencies to carry out the testing programme. Geoff Barton, general secretary of head teachers' union, the Association of School and College Leaders, said it seemed a ""sensible and prudent approach"" to delay the return to school, given the rising rates of Covid and the new strain of the virus. He added: ""What is vital is that schools are given clear guidance as soon as possible so they can make the necessary arrangements."" Senior Conservative MP, Sir Roger Gale, called for a decision to be made ""now"" on when pupils would return to school. He told BBC Radio 4's PM programme: ""When the situation changes, policy has to change decision. The decision to send primary and secondary school children back to school early in the new year was taken before the spread of the new breed of virus. ""We now know it's pernicious and we know that it affects young people as well as older people. It does seem to me, if we are going to get on top of the spread of the disease we have to do something about young people going back to school."" The Ministry of Defence said 1,500 personnel will form local response teams, providing support and phone advice to institutions on setting up and running Covid testing facilities. Support would be offered ""predominantly through webinars and individual meetings"", it said, but teams would also be on standby to provide in-person support at short notice. England:Secondary school pupils in exam years will return at the start of term while others begin their learning online. Face-to-face learning is expected to resume for everyone by 11 January. Primary schools will return as normal Scotland:Schools will start term on 11 January with learning taking place online until at least 18 January. Wales:Term will start with online learning, but the majority of pupils are expected to resume face-to-face lessons by 11 January. A full return to the classroom is expected to be complete by 18 January Northern Ireland:All schools will initially reopen for face-to-face teaching at the start of term, but years 8 to 10 will move to remote learning from 25 January for at least two weeks Schools in all the UK nations are remaining open for vulnerable children. England, Wales and Scotland have also committed to maintain face-to-face teaching for children of key workers. Mr Barton said schools had been hoping for ""boots on the ground"" in schools and colleges to help run testing centres. ""Instead, it appears that there will be 1,500 personnel available for more than 3,400 secondary schools in England, and that the support will be mainly in the form of webinars and meetings,"" he said. ""This is not remotely sufficient to support schools in the huge task they are being asked to undertake by the government."" There is also pressure from other teaching unions for schools to move to online learning for all pupils except those deemed vulnerable or children of key workers. A meeting was held between ministers, Downing Street officials and the Department for Education on Monday to discuss the plan further, but the department would not comment on its outcome. Some teaching union leaders are also understood to have met DfE officials on Tuesday afternoon. Early research by the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine suggestsschools and universities might need to close on top of existing tier four restrictionsto bring the new fast-spreading coronavirus variant under control. The military has previously helped organise mass testing in Liverpool The military has previously helped organise mass testing in Liverpool and more recently in Kent to clear the backlog of lorries caused by France shutting its UK border. Students will swab themselves in the vast majority of cases, under the supervision of school staff or a volunteer who has been trained for the role, and teachers are not expected to take a role in the testing process. The idea in schools is that following one round of testing all pupils, school staff would be offered a test every week. Then anyone who is a close contact of someone testing positive would be offered tests every day for seven days. This would cut the amount of school pupils miss due to self isolation, and help keep the virus out of schools. SCHOOLS:What will happen if children catch coronavirus?

"This video can not be played The earthquake caused extensive damage in Petrinja and Zagreb At least seven people are known to have died in a magnitude 6.4 earthquake that struck central Croatia on Tuesday. Rescue teams spent the night scouring the rubble of damaged buildings in the search for survivors. A 12-year-old girl was killed in Petrinja, the prime minister said as he visited the town. Five people died in the nearby town of Glina, his deputy said. A seventh victim was found in the rubble of a church in Zazina, state media reports. Petrinja's mayor said that about half the town had been destroyed and people had been pulled from the rubble. Many were too afraid to return to their homes overnight in case aftershocks caused more damage, officials said. Some people slept in their cars or stayed with relatives in other areas. About 200 people sheltered in a military barracks. EU crisis management chief Janez Lenarcic is due to visit Petrinja on Wednesday. The search for survivors continued overnight The earthquake was felt in the Croatian capital Zagreb, in neighbouring Bosnia and Serbia, and as far away as Italy. One woman was pulled alive from the rubble of the town hall in Petrinja on Tuesday, Croatian media reported. Some of the injured were evacuated to Zagreb ""We are pulling people from the cars, we don't know if we have dead or injured,"" Darinko Dumbovic, the mayor of Petrinja, told regional broadcaster N1 on Tuesday. ""There is general panic, people are looking for their loved ones."" The mayor was speaking to reporters when Petrinja, home to 20,000 people, was hit by another, weaker, tremor.

""Even if we wanted to, we can't go back in, there is no electricity."" People were also injured in the nearby town of Sisak. National broadcaster HRT said the local hospital there was struggling to cope with the number of casualties arriving for treatment. Some displaced people have been forced to sleep at a military base Tomislav Fabijanic, head of emergency medical services in Sisak, said they were seeing fractures and concussions, and some people had needed surgery. The GFZ German Research Centre for Geosciences reported that the earthquake struck at 11:19 GMT at a depth of 10km (6 miles). The second tremor followed an hour or so later. The Croatian Mountain Rescue Service said that rescuers from across Croatia had travelled to Petrinja to help with the search and recovery effort. Allow Twitter content?

Prime Minister Andrej Plenkovic, who rushed to Petrinja, said: ""The army is here to help. We will have to move some people from Petrinja because it is unsafe to be here,"" he added. Croatia's president and prime minister saw for themselves the scale of damage in Petrinja within two hours of the earthquake and were united in their response. President Zoran Milanovic compared the scene to Grozny, the capital of the the Russian republic of Chechnya, which was largely destroyed during a siege 20 years ago. The prime minister said it was ""clear as day"" that Petrinja was no longer safe for human habitation. Petrinja is home to some 20,000 residents and the prime minister said it was now unsafe to live in It is a bitter blow for the town's people, who faced a significant rebuilding operation after Croatia's war of independence in the 1990s. More recently, they have been tackling economic devastation, with the decline of traditional industries. Croatia's leaders have promised funds for reconstruction. But Petrinja's residents will be seeing in the new year in temporary accommodation - with little prospect of an early return home. A kindergarten also collapsed in Petrinja, but it was empty at the time of the quake. In a village just outside Petrinja, a worker told N1 that nine of its 10 houses were destroyed. Slovenia has moved to close the Krsko nuclear power plant it co-owns with Croatia. The US Geological Survey said it was the largest earthquake to occur in Croatia since the introduction of modern seismic instrumentation. An earthquake of similar size occurred in 1880 near Zagreb. A magnitude 5.2 earthquake hit central Croatia on Monday and there are fears of more. Branko Dragicevic of the Serbian seismological institute told the BBC: ""We can expect further quakes.""

"Sir Keir Starmer is facing a rebellion over his decision to back Boris Johnson's EU trade deal on Wednesday. The Labour leader will order his MPs to vote for the deal in the Commons, ensuring it should pass into law in time for the UK's exit from EU rules. Sir Keir has called the deal ""thin"" and not what the government promised, but better than no deal. Critics led by ex-shadow Chancellor John McDonnell are urging the Labour leader not to back the ""rotten"" deal. SNP MPs to vote against Brexit trade deal Landmark post-Brexit trade deal to be signed Where do UK political parties stand on Brexit vote? EU ambassadors approve post-Brexit trade deal Other opposition parties, including the SNP, the Lib Dems, Plaid Cymru andall Northern Ireland partiesthat take seats at Westminster, have indicated they will be voting against the deal. But the prime minister has received a boost from a powerful group of backbench Tory Brexiteers, who have indicated they will back the deal. The European Research Group (ERG) said it had examined the text in detail and concluded that it ""preserves the UK's sovereignty as a matter of law"". The government bill - which puts the trade deal agreed with the EU into law - would have passed comfortably in any case, thanks to Labour support, when MPs and peers are recalled from their Christmas recess to vote on it on Wednesday. Sir Keir, who campaigned against Brexit, has hit back at calls for Labour to abstain in the vote so it cannot be blamed for any economic damage that may result from the deal, and hold the government to account more effectively in the coming months. He has said the agreement -announced by Mr Johnson on Christmas Eve, following months of wrangling - does not do enough to protect the environment, jobs and workers' rights. But he wants Labour to back it because, he argues, the only alternative is a damaging no-deal exit from the EU single market and customs union on Thursday. He has said Labour MPs must vote for the deal, rather than abstain, because it ""it is not credible for Labour to be on the sidelines"". On Sunday, shadow chancellor Anneliese Dodds - whoreportedly has her own misgivings about backing a deal,external- urged Labour MPs to vote for it. ""I'm not going to say to you that this is the deal that Labour would have secured because it really isn't - this is a thin deal - but we don't want to create more problems for businesses right now by preventing the implementation of what the government has achieved."" Butin a statement,externalorganised by left-wing groups Another Europe is Possible and Labour for a Socialist Europe, her predecessor as shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, urged Labour to abstain. The statement, which is signed by figures from across the party, says it is the duty of the opposition to provide proper Parliamentary scrutiny and to set out an alternative. ""That task gets harder if opposition parties fall into the trap of rallying around this rotten deal,"" it said. ""We are witnessing an act of vandalism against our livelihoods, our rights and our horizons. ""We call on Labour, the Labour movement and other opposition parties not to support the Tories' Brexit deal when it is put to a vote in the House of Commons."" Signatories include former cabinet ministers and leading pro-Europeans Ben Bradshaw and Lord Adonis, as well as former MEPs, councillors and local activists. Norwich South MP Clive Lewis signed the letter and said he would be abstaining as the deal was ""a long-term bear-trap"". He told BBC News that Sir Keir was ""making a fundamental mistake,"" adding: ""If he'd whipped to abstain he'd have a unified party."" Separately, some Labour MPs have indicated they are likely to abstain or vote against the deal. Bermondsey and Old Southwark MP Neil Coyle saidresearch by the IPPR think tank,externalproved the deal was a ""another nail in the coffin"" for workers' rights. In a tweet, he said that an abstention did not allow the possibility of no deal. ""An abstention registers concerns about the deal without allowing the catastrophe of no deal.""

"Keyon Harrold said the incident had ""traumatised"" his son An investigation has been launched after a 14-year-old black teenager was allegedly assaulted by a white woman who falsely accused him of stealing her phone in a hotel lobby in New York.

Mr Harrold said the incident had ""traumatised"" his son. Mayor Bill de Blasio said: ""This is racism. Plain and simple."" In a tweet, he added: ""It would be horrific at any age, but it's especially offensive that it happened to a child."" The musician and his son, Keyon Harrold Jr, were staying at the Arlo Hotel in Manhattan when the confrontation took place. ""I hate I have to post this!!!"" he wrote on Instagram on Saturday. ""The lady in this video assaulted my 14-year-old son and me as we came down from our room in the Arlo Soho to get breakfast."" In the video, which has been viewed more than two million times,,externala woman wearing a face mask can be seen standing behind a hotel employee and lunging at Mr Harrold and his son after accusing the teenager of stealing her iPhone. Mr Harrold accused the woman of scratching him and tackling his son after he stopped filming. The phone was later returned by an Uber driver, according to the musician. Prosecutors in Manhattan are now investigating the incident. In an update posted to Mr Harrold's Instagram account, the family said they had decided to go public with the footage because of the hotel's response to the woman's behaviour. In a statement, Arlo Hotels said it was ""deeply disheartened about the recent incident of baseless accusation, prejudice and assault against an innocent guest"", adding that it apologised to Mr Harrold and his son. Mr Harrold's experience has been compared to other incidents this year in which black people have faced false accusations. In May,a white woman called  911 on a black manafter he asked her to put her dog on a lead in New York's Central Park. The exchange was filmed and Ms Cooper, who lost her job and dog after the incident, now faces a criminal charge of filing a false report.

"This video can not be played The earthquake caused extensive damage in Petrinja and Zagreb At least seven people are known to have died in a magnitude 6.4 earthquake that struck central Croatia on Tuesday. Rescue teams spent the night scouring the rubble of damaged buildings in the search for survivors. A 12-year-old girl was killed in Petrinja, the prime minister said as he visited the town. Five people died in the nearby town of Glina, his deputy said. A seventh victim was found in the rubble of a church in Zazina, state media reports. Petrinja's mayor said that about half the town had been destroyed and people had been pulled from the rubble. Many were too afraid to return to their homes overnight in case aftershocks caused more damage, officials said. Some people slept in their cars or stayed with relatives in other areas. About 200 people sheltered in a military barracks. EU crisis management chief Janez Lenarcic is due to visit Petrinja on Wednesday. The search for survivors continued overnight The earthquake was felt in the Croatian capital Zagreb, in neighbouring Bosnia and Serbia, and as far away as Italy. One woman was pulled alive from the rubble of the town hall in Petrinja on Tuesday, Croatian media reported. Some of the injured were evacuated to Zagreb ""We are pulling people from the cars, we don't know if we have dead or injured,"" Darinko Dumbovic, the mayor of Petrinja, told regional broadcaster N1 on Tuesday. ""There is general panic, people are looking for their loved ones."" The mayor was speaking to reporters when Petrinja, home to 20,000 people, was hit by another, weaker, tremor.

""Even if we wanted to, we can't go back in, there is no electricity."" People were also injured in the nearby town of Sisak. National broadcaster HRT said the local hospital there was struggling to cope with the number of casualties arriving for treatment. Some displaced people have been forced to sleep at a military base Tomislav Fabijanic, head of emergency medical services in Sisak, said they were seeing fractures and concussions, and some people had needed surgery. The GFZ German Research Centre for Geosciences reported that the earthquake struck at 11:19 GMT at a depth of 10km (6 miles). The second tremor followed an hour or so later. The Croatian Mountain Rescue Service said that rescuers from across Croatia had travelled to Petrinja to help with the search and recovery effort. Allow Twitter content?

Prime Minister Andrej Plenkovic, who rushed to Petrinja, said: ""The army is here to help. We will have to move some people from Petrinja because it is unsafe to be here,"" he added. Croatia's president and prime minister saw for themselves the scale of damage in Petrinja within two hours of the earthquake and were united in their response. President Zoran Milanovic compared the scene to Grozny, the capital of the the Russian republic of Chechnya, which was largely destroyed during a siege 20 years ago. The prime minister said it was ""clear as day"" that Petrinja was no longer safe for human habitation. Petrinja is home to some 20,000 residents and the prime minister said it was now unsafe to live in It is a bitter blow for the town's people, who faced a significant rebuilding operation after Croatia's war of independence in the 1990s. More recently, they have been tackling economic devastation, with the decline of traditional industries. Croatia's leaders have promised funds for reconstruction. But Petrinja's residents will be seeing in the new year in temporary accommodation - with little prospect of an early return home. A kindergarten also collapsed in Petrinja, but it was empty at the time of the quake. In a village just outside Petrinja, a worker told N1 that nine of its 10 houses were destroyed. Slovenia has moved to close the Krsko nuclear power plant it co-owns with Croatia. The US Geological Survey said it was the largest earthquake to occur in Croatia since the introduction of modern seismic instrumentation. An earthquake of similar size occurred in 1880 near Zagreb. A magnitude 5.2 earthquake hit central Croatia on Monday and there are fears of more. Branko Dragicevic of the Serbian seismological institute told the BBC: ""We can expect further quakes.""

"NHS Shetland is asking people to think about their actions Shetland is ""almost certain"" to be moved into level four restrictions if a new wave of Covid infections continues, health officials have warned. There have been 34 cases within the last week, with the total expected to rise, and 120 people have also been asked to isolate. NHS Grampian confirmed the outbreak is ""associated with a social event and some household transmission"". The board said it was hopeful it could bring transmission under control.

'Stay at home' Hogmanay plea as Covid cases surge The islands that halted an outbreak by locking down early The new confirmed cases have spread from the north mainland of Shetland to Lerwick. There were 14 confirmed cases on Monday and another four on Tuesday. The current situation is described as by far the most serious outbreak in Shetland since March. NHS Shetland said the best way to stop the virus was to stay at home for the next two weeks - and work from home - as much as possible. Speaking to Drivetime, the director of public health for NHS Shetland and NHS Grampian, Susan Webb, said: ""As all of the cases can be linked to the original cluster, we remain hopeful... that we will be able to bring the transmission under control. ""We are monitoring the situation incredibly carefully."" But, she added that if necessary a move to level four would be recommended. Public Health Principal Elizabeth Robinson said: ""This is a virus that knows no bounds. It has infected many in our community during the festive season. ""This is not a time to judge or point fingers but rather for each one of us to look at our own actions and ensure that we are doing everything possible to keep ourselves and others safe.

"London's Nightingale hospital was built in nine days, with the help of hundreds of soldiers London's Nightingale hospital remains on standby, despite the removal of some of its equipment, NHS England has said. England's hospitalsare currently treating more Covid-19 patientsthan during the previous peak of the virus in April. Some equipment, including beds and ventilators, are no longer at the ExCel Centre site, it is understood. NHS England said the facility would be available to support the capital's hospitals if needed. It sent a letter to trusts on 23 December asking them to plan for the use of additional facilities such as the Nightingale hospitals. The ExCel Centre site, which opened on 3 April with space for 4,000 beds to treat Covid-19 patients,was placed on standby in Maywhen fewer than 20 patients were being treated there. Will virus variant force the Nightingales to open? Health workers 'back in eye of storm' How the UK's newest hospital was built in nine days A spokesperson for the NHS said: ""The Nightingale in London remains on standby and will be available to support the capital's hospitals if needed. ""In the meantime it is vital that Londoners do everything possible to reduce transmission and cut the number of new infections which otherwise inevitably result in more avoidable deaths."" However, concerns have been raised about the already-stretched NHS's ability to staff Nightingale facilities. Dr Nick Scriven, the former president of the Society for Acute Medicine, said: ""It is not 'just the case' of using the Nightingale hospital as there are simply no staff for them to run as they were originally intended. ""They could play a role perhaps if used as rehabilitation units for those recovering but, again, where do we find the specialist staff - the NHS simply does not have the capacity to spare anyone."" Shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth said the Nightingale hospitals had been opened ""at great expense and fanfare"". The Labour MP tweeted: ""But the reality is years of Tory failures to invest in training and staffing has left NHS short of staff needed."" Officials, including Health Secretary Matt Hancock, were at the opening of the hospital on 3 April Despite the problems, Chris Hopson of NHS Providers, which represents hospital trusts, said it was still the right decision to build the hospitals earlier this year. Even without complex equipment, they could still have a role given many Covid-19 patients are now treated on general wards with oxygen therapy, he said. He said the NHS would use ""every ounce"" of existing capacity it could muster before the Nightingales were used routinely. The hospital, which was formerly a large exhibition space in London's Docklands, was planned as part of the UK's response to the coronavirus pandemic. There are other Nightingale hospitals in Birmingham, Manchester, Bristol, Exeter, Sunderland and Harrogate.

Wales is onalert level fourso people must not travel into or out of the country and can only leave home for essential reasons. On Monday and Tuesday,cars filled a car parkbelow Pen y Fan, the highest mountain in southern Britain. Dyfed-Powys Police said more than 500 vehicles were in the area on Tuesday, including a minibus from Cheltenham. The force said people from mixed households travelled in the minibus, while they had also spoken to a man who had travelled from Hertfordshire. ""Fixed penalty notices have and will be issued to those blatant breaches where engagement fails,"" it added. A large number of people were seen at Pen y Fan on Monday Meanwhile, an intensive care consultant said the scenes were ""very disappointing"" as hospitalswere under pressure. Dr David Hepburn said he understands why people want to visit beauty spots but it was against the rules. He said it was still unclear what impact Christmas had had on case numbers. ""All the hospitals across the health board are now very, very full,"" said Dr Hepburn, who works as a consultant in the Aneurin Bevan University Health Board. He said while his intensive care unit was coping, he added: ""We've still got quite a lot of time to go before this pandemic is under control, so really anything could happen over the next month or so."" Police have been turning people away from the area Police roadblocks were in place on Tuesday in the Brecon Beacons, with cars lining the A470 to gain access to the area. Visitors to the national park on Tuesday also included people from London, currentlyunder tier-four restrictions, as well as numerous visitors from Swansea, Cardiff and Newport. Q&A: What has changed as Wales locks down? Crowds head for Brecon Beacons as snow falls What's the advice on travelling over Christmas? Dyfed-Powys Police said that ""there was in excess of 500 vehicles"" and officers had been turning away visitors and reminding those coming off the mountain of Wales' lockdown rules, which include the fact that exercise must start and end at home.

Travelling is only allowed for essential purposes, such as for work and for caring responsibilities. International travel is also not allowed.

"This video can not be played Covid in Scotland: Nicola Sturgeon urges people to 'stay at home' this Hogmanay Scots have been urged to stay at home and not celebrate Hogmanay with other households as daily Covid-19 case numbers hit a record high. Another 1,895 cases were reported on Tuesday - the highest logged on a single day since mass testing began. The whole Scottish mainland is in thehighest level of restrictionsin a bid to contain a new strain of the virus. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said it was ""especially vital"" people did not mix indoors with other households. The near 2,000 cases reported on Tuesday was double the number logged on Monday, with 14.4% of tests returning a positive result. Ms Sturgeon said there had been ""quite a big jump in cases"", although there could be a ""Christmas lag"" in reporting some results. Covid in Scotland: Where are the latest cases? Shetland 'set for level 4' if Covid cases rise Confirmed Covid cases in Scotland pass 120,000 She said the new strain of Covid-19 was ""contributing to faster spread"" of the virus, with a rising trend across the country and particular concerns over Shetland and the south of Scotland. The first minister said: ""The main message to people is to make sure you are not visiting other people's houses just now. Unfortunately that includes Hogmanay and New Year. ""This is a time of year I know people enjoy getting together, but that's not safe to do this year. ""As we head into the Hogmanay and new year period I really do appeal to people to stay out of the homes of others, celebrate new year in your own home only with your own household."" A further seven deaths of patients who had tested positive for Covid-19 in the last 28 days were also reported on Tuesday, although registration offices were closed over the festive break and the publication of most figures has been delayed. As of Tuesday there were 1,092 people in hospital with a recently-confirmed case of the virus, with 65 in intensive care. The whole of mainland Scotland has been in level four - the top tier of measures - since Boxing Day, and will remain there for at least three weeks. Officials are also considering on a daily basis whether to escalate restrictions on Scotland's islands, which are currently in level three. Ms Sturgeon said the situation in Shetland in particular was being ""very clearly monitored"". She also said there were concerns about ""quite significant increases"" in cases in Dumfries and Galloway and the Borders.

"Members of the armed forces are to give remote support to secondary schools and colleges in England setting up mass Covid testing as the new term begins. Military personnel will hold webinars and give phone support to school staff. But head teachers say they need support on the ground and more time to make the plan workable. They are calling for a delay to the start of term. The government wants pupils to go back in the first two weeks of January, but is keeping the situation under review. What is happening with schools in January? Impact of new variant on children investigated Will schools be closed next term by variant of virus? How does mass testing work? Under the current plans, the majority of secondary school pupils in England are due to start term on 4 January studying remotely, to give head teachers time to implement a round of coronavirus testing for students and staff. Primary school students will return as normal during the same week and will not be tested for Covid-19. Those in exam years and vulnerable pupils will return in person first, with the rest expected to go back on 11 January. But this entails 5.5 million secondary pupils being tested in schools in the space of a week. Several media reports suggest ministers are considering delaying the start of term, with potentially only exam year pupils starting remotely in the first week of January. In response to the reports, a spokesman for the Department for Education said: ""We want all pupils to return in January as school is the best place for their development and mental health. ""But as the prime minister has said, it is right that we follow the path of the pandemic and keep our approach under constant review."" It added that funds had been made available for schools to hire staff from employment agencies to carry out the testing programme. Geoff Barton, general secretary of head teachers' union, the Association of School and College Leaders, said it seemed a ""sensible and prudent approach"" to delay the return to school, given the rising rates of Covid and the new strain of the virus. He added: ""What is vital is that schools are given clear guidance as soon as possible so they can make the necessary arrangements."" Senior Conservative MP, Sir Roger Gale, called for a decision to be made ""now"" on when pupils would return to school. He told BBC Radio 4's PM programme: ""When the situation changes, policy has to change decision. The decision to send primary and secondary school children back to school early in the new year was taken before the spread of the new breed of virus. ""We now know it's pernicious and we know that it affects young people as well as older people. It does seem to me, if we are going to get on top of the spread of the disease we have to do something about young people going back to school."" The Ministry of Defence said 1,500 personnel will form local response teams, providing support and phone advice to institutions on setting up and running Covid testing facilities. Support would be offered ""predominantly through webinars and individual meetings"", it said, but teams would also be on standby to provide in-person support at short notice. England:Secondary school pupils in exam years will return at the start of term while others begin their learning online. Face-to-face learning is expected to resume for everyone by 11 January. Primary schools will return as normal Scotland:Schools will start term on 11 January with learning taking place online until at least 18 January. Wales:Term will start with online learning, but the majority of pupils are expected to resume face-to-face lessons by 11 January. A full return to the classroom is expected to be complete by 18 January Northern Ireland:All schools will initially reopen for face-to-face teaching at the start of term, but years 8 to 10 will move to remote learning from 25 January for at least two weeks Schools in all the UK nations are remaining open for vulnerable children. England, Wales and Scotland have also committed to maintain face-to-face teaching for children of key workers. Mr Barton said schools had been hoping for ""boots on the ground"" in schools and colleges to help run testing centres. ""Instead, it appears that there will be 1,500 personnel available for more than 3,400 secondary schools in England, and that the support will be mainly in the form of webinars and meetings,"" he said. ""This is not remotely sufficient to support schools in the huge task they are being asked to undertake by the government."" There is also pressure from other teaching unions for schools to move to online learning for all pupils except those deemed vulnerable or children of key workers. A meeting was held between ministers, Downing Street officials and the Department for Education on Monday to discuss the plan further, but the department would not comment on its outcome. Some teaching union leaders are also understood to have met DfE officials on Tuesday afternoon. Early research by the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine suggestsschools and universities might need to close on top of existing tier four restrictionsto bring the new fast-spreading coronavirus variant under control. The military has previously helped organise mass testing in Liverpool The military has previously helped organise mass testing in Liverpool and more recently in Kent to clear the backlog of lorries caused by France shutting its UK border. Students will swab themselves in the vast majority of cases, under the supervision of school staff or a volunteer who has been trained for the role, and teachers are not expected to take a role in the testing process. The idea in schools is that following one round of testing all pupils, school staff would be offered a test every week. Then anyone who is a close contact of someone testing positive would be offered tests every day for seven days. This would cut the amount of school pupils miss due to self isolation, and help keep the virus out of schools. SCHOOLS:What will happen if children catch coronavirus?

"Adam Lambert (left) and Tituss Burgess will bring the TikTok-made musical to life When TikTok creators posted songs inspired by the 2007 film Ratatouille this summer, they didn't imagine they would ever form a star-studded musical. But that's what will happen on 1 January, when they are performed by big names from TV, music and theatre. The one-off performance will feature Queen singer Adam Lambert, Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt star Tituss Burgess and Tony Award winner Andre De Shields. The animated Pixar film follows French rat Remy's dreams of becoming a chef. The musical version started life in August when New York teacher and Ratatouille superfan Emily Jacobson wrote and posted a rousing song about Remy, ""the rat of all my dreams"", on TikTok as a joke. Two months later, composer and orchestrator Daniel Mertzlufft added a Broadway-style musical arrangement - and hundreds of other TikTok creators followed suit by posting their own tunes about the film's characters and plot.

The cast also includes Emmy-winning actor and comedian Wayne Brady, plus Broadway stars Ashley Park, Andrew Barth Feldman, Priscilla Lopez and Mary Testa. They will be joined by the 20-piece Broadway Sinfonietta orchestra, and the show will raise money for The Actors Fund, which has been supporting performers during the pandemic. No location for the performance has been announced, with organisers saying they are ""working primarily virtually to bring this event to life"".

"This video can not be played Covid in Scotland: Nicola Sturgeon urges people to 'stay at home' this Hogmanay Scots have been urged to stay at home and not celebrate Hogmanay with other households as daily Covid-19 case numbers hit a record high. Another 1,895 cases were reported on Tuesday - the highest logged on a single day since mass testing began. The whole Scottish mainland is in thehighest level of restrictionsin a bid to contain a new strain of the virus. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said it was ""especially vital"" people did not mix indoors with other households. The near 2,000 cases reported on Tuesday was double the number logged on Monday, with 14.4% of tests returning a positive result. Ms Sturgeon said there had been ""quite a big jump in cases"", although there could be a ""Christmas lag"" in reporting some results. Covid in Scotland: Where are the latest cases? Shetland 'set for level 4' if Covid cases rise Confirmed Covid cases in Scotland pass 120,000 She said the new strain of Covid-19 was ""contributing to faster spread"" of the virus, with a rising trend across the country and particular concerns over Shetland and the south of Scotland. The first minister said: ""The main message to people is to make sure you are not visiting other people's houses just now. Unfortunately that includes Hogmanay and New Year. ""This is a time of year I know people enjoy getting together, but that's not safe to do this year. ""As we head into the Hogmanay and new year period I really do appeal to people to stay out of the homes of others, celebrate new year in your own home only with your own household."" A further seven deaths of patients who had tested positive for Covid-19 in the last 28 days were also reported on Tuesday, although registration offices were closed over the festive break and the publication of most figures has been delayed. As of Tuesday there were 1,092 people in hospital with a recently-confirmed case of the virus, with 65 in intensive care. The whole of mainland Scotland has been in level four - the top tier of measures - since Boxing Day, and will remain there for at least three weeks. Officials are also considering on a daily basis whether to escalate restrictions on Scotland's islands, which are currently in level three. Ms Sturgeon said the situation in Shetland in particular was being ""very clearly monitored"". She also said there were concerns about ""quite significant increases"" in cases in Dumfries and Galloway and the Borders. MSPs are to be given an update on the latest situation on Wednesday, when the Scottish Parliament is being recalled from recess to debate the Brexit deal.

"Teaching moved online for secondary schools in the final week before Christmas A teachers' union wants to know if shutting schools early before Christmas did anything to bring down the Covid-19 transmission rate in Wales. The Association of School and College Leaders Cymru (ASCLC) also called for quick action on plans for schooling if cases continued to rise in Wales with a new strain of the virus circulating. Children are set to return to school in January on a staggered basis. The Welsh Government said it was closely monitoring transmission rates. Before Christmas, scientific advice suggested families with children should consider ""pre-isolating"" at home for 10 days before seeing elderly relatives. Allow Twitter content?

You may want to readTwitterâs cookie policy,externalandprivacy policy,externalbefore accepting. To view this content chooseâaccept and continueâ. The advice was contained in a report by the Welsh Government's Technical Advisory Group (TAG). All secondary schools and colleges shut a week early but some counties kept primary schools open until 18 December. Staggered return for Wales' schools in January Covid hospital pressures 'incredibly challenging' Figuring out the stats on coronavirus in Wales As of 23 December, the R number had increased again to between 1 and 1.3 in Wales, with an estimate from Public Health Wales of 1.2 based on case rates. This means for every 10 people with the virus, 12 more people would be infected. ""We closed for a week at the end of last term to try to get the R rate down,"" said Eithne Hughes, director of the ASCLC. ""Have things changed significantly as a consequence of schools closing?"" Ms Hughes said there needed to be very clear communication if there was any change of plan on schools returning. ""We need to know extremely quickly in order that parents and schools know exactly where they are in a very short space of time,"" she added. Head Chris Britten wants to see school workers prioritised for vaccines Chris Britten is head of Ysgol Y Deri Special School in Penarth, Vale of Glamorgan, which has had over 60 positive Covid results since November. He said: ""It keeps you awake at nightâ¦ ""We've had a lot of staff who are very ill and remain ill. ""When I get a member of staff in intensive care you do sort of think 'maybe we should have done more, maybe we should have done something different' -  but that way kind of lies madness really, we do everything we can."" He wants to see school workers prioritised for vaccines, more regular testing in schools and for any changes to plans for children to return in January to be communicated as soon as possible. He added: ""There's not a head teacher that doesn't want all the kids in school but I would just like people to note that there are 300 adults in our school in a relatively confined space, working together - they can't socially distance from themselves or the kids because of the nature of the work."" Headteacher of Eastern High School in Cardiff Armando Di-Finizio said he was concerned about pupils' wellbeing and academic progress and wanted to see schools open in January as planned. He told BBC Radio Wales: ""I'd be interested to know what the safety issues are with children because when I look at the ONS data, children seem to be completely safe and there's no conclusive evidence either way that they're actually spreading it to adults. ""I know that might sound terrible me saying that but I've not had any conclusive dataâ¦ ""I didn't see a spike when schools first went back and teachers are in classes with 30 pupils every day - surely it would be a lot more cases through pupils to pass it to staff or pupils to pupils but that doesn't doesn't seem to be happening on a grand scale."" Scientists areurgently investigatinghints the new variant of coronavirus spreads more easily in children and say if proven, this could account for ""a significant proportion"" of the increase in transmission. The claim comes from members of the government's New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats advisory group (Nervtag). Children almost universally shrug off the virus, but the variant could alter the role they, and schools, play in spreading the virus. Earlier strains of coronavirus found it harder to infect children than adults. Clare Ferguson Walker, a mother of two from Tavernspite in Pembrokeshire, is also keen for children to return as planned. She said: ""I'll be absolutely honest with you, it is starting to become a complete nightmare home educating the kids. ""At first it almost felt like a kind of novelty and we were managing fine - it was almost like an extended sort of summer holiday period - but it has massively taken its toll on the kids' mental health, on my mental health. ""It's becoming incredibly difficult and I think we are starting to have to ask the question now of the balance between physical safety and actually the mental wellbeing of our kids and the impact of that on families."" The Welsh Government said coronavirus cases ""remain very high in Wales"". A spokeswoman added: ""We are closely monitoring the impact of the decisions we have taken to protect people's health, including the move to alert level four and the decision to provide online learning for the final week of term for secondary school and college students. ""Whilst there are encouraging signs that the package of measures introduced in the weeks before Christmas may have had an impact, this is not the case in every area of Wales. ""We would want to see a sustained trend before starting to draw conclusions.""

"This video can not be played President-elect Biden accuses the Trump administration of ""irresponsibility"" over national security US President-elect Joe Biden has accused the US defence department of ""irresponsibility"" for failing to give his team the information it needs for the transition of power. He said his team had encountered ""obstruction from the political leadership"". Mr Biden also claimed that agencies critical to US security had suffered ""enormous damage"" under Donald Trump. A Pentagon spokesman said it had been ""completely transparent"". Mr Biden takes office on 20 January but President Trump has refused to concede. For weeks after the 3 November election, Mr Biden was blocked from receiving key intelligence briefings, an essential and normally routine part of a presidential transition. After Mr Trump finally agreed to allow the formal transition process last month,Mr Biden praised the White House for its help in the process. But his tone had changed on Monday. Mr Biden spoke after a briefing by national security and foreign policy aides. In a speech which he posted on Twitter,external, Mr Biden said his team was facing ""roadblocks"" in the defence department and the Office of Management and Budget. ""Right now, we just aren't getting all the information that we need from the outgoing administration in key national security areas,"" he said. ""It's nothing short, in my view, of irresponsibility."" The president-elect added that his team needed a ""clear picture of our force posture around the world"" and that US adversaries could exploit any confusion that resulted. What to expect when Biden is sworn in What Joe Biden wants to do The unstoppable rise of Kamala Harris Does Biden's new team better reflect America? Following Mr Biden's remarks, Acting Defence Secretary Christopher Miller said officials had been ""working with the utmost professionalism to support transition activities"". ""The Department of Defense has conducted 164 interviews with over 400 officials and provided over 5,000 pages of documents - far more than initially requested by Biden's transition team,"" he said. Thepresidential transition processis the handover of important information and duties from the outgoing administration to the president-elect and his or her team, ensuring that they are fully up to speed when they reach the White House on 20 January. Christopher Miller was appointed acting defence secretary by President Trump after he sacked Mark Esper The president-elect described key security agencies as having been ""hollowed out"" in personnel, capacity and morale. ""The policy processes have atrophied or have been sidelined,"" he added, saying that this was ""to the despair of our alliances"". Mr Trump sacked his Defence Secretary Mark Espershortly after the election, apparently over Mr Esper's disagreement with his call to deploy the military against anti-racism protesters. Mr Trump's subsequent installation of loyalists in the department was viewed with concern by political opponents, who saw it as an attempt to sow chaos in the final weeks of his administration. The president has not commented on Mr Biden's latest remarks. Mr Esper himself became defence secretary only in 2019. President Trump's first defence secretary was Gen Jim Mattis, who left the post after his views and the president's increasingly diverged. Other senior security officials who have left their positions in the Trump administration include Navy Secretary Richard Spencer, fired in November 2019, and John Bolton, who left his job as national security adviser in September 2019. He was the third person to hold that role under Mr Trump. The White House revolving door What time is Biden's inauguration?

"The Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health is urging parents to look out for signs of eating disorders in children and young people. Its snapshot survey suggests in some parts of Great Britain doctors have seen a three or four-fold increase in cases compared to last year. Specialists say the pandemic is a major reason behind the rise. NHS England says though record numbers are getting care for eating disorders, more will need support. The Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health heard from around 40 specialists working in England, Scotland and Wales who said they had seen a rise in referrals. What is an eating disorder? Information and support: Eating disorders The organisation says many factors are involved - including isolation from friends during school closures, exam cancellations, loss of extra-curricular activities like sport, and an increased use of social media. Fears about the virus, family finances, and students being forced to quarantine may also have contributed. And doctors say in some cases, reduced access to face-to-face consultations may have led to young people becoming severely ill by the time they were seen. The anecdotal reports suggest in some areas waiting lists are ""completely overwhelmed"" and beds ""increasingly scarce."" Dr Simon Chapman, at King's College Hospital and South London and the Maudsley, said referrals since March had tripled and assessments were harder because they were done through a screen. He added: ""I've worked in eating disorders for 10 years and I have never known us to be so busy... ""I would say to any parent or teacher, if they notice anything different about their young person and are worried they may be developing an eating disorder, talk early on to the GP about their concerns or reach out to their local eating disorders service for advice."" Meanwhile, Dr Karen Street, at the Royal Devon and Exeter Hospital, said the earlier eating disorders are noticed, the better the chance people could have successful treatment. She added: ""Eating disorders begin with often quite small changes such as refusing to eat foods that were previously enjoyed. ""If you've noticed a difference in the way your child or teenager approaches food and exercise and it concerns you, talk to them about what's normal and what is not - often those with eating disorders will try to convince you all is OK but trust your instincts. ""Seek advice from your GP and from helplines and if you're still concerned, contact local eating disorder team."" Tom Quinn, of eating disorder charity, Beat, said demand for its helpline had more than doubled since February. He added: ""The increased focus on food over the Christmas period, coupled with the deluge of diet messaging in the New Year can be a toxic combination for young people at risk of an eating disorder, so it is more important than ever to be aware of the early signs and to take action quickly."" NHS Digital figures for England suggest hospital admissions for children with eating disorders have risen in all age groups over two years. The data, obtained by the PA news agency, shows there were 21,794 admissions for eating disorders among all age groups in 2019/20 compared to 16,547 in 2017/18. Claire Murdoch, NHS England's mental health director, said the health service was expanding care every year and continued to offer face-to-face appointments and inpatient care when needed. She said young people also stood to benefit from recently announced rapid access to specialist NHS treatment across England. What is an eating disorder?

"The elderly are among those receiving the first wave of vaccinations in Spain Spain is to set up a register of people who refuse to be vaccinated against coronavirus and share it with other European Union nations, the health minister has said. Salvador Illa said the list would not be made accessible to the public or to employers. He said the way to defeat the virus was ""to vaccinate all of us - the more the better"". Spain has been one of the countries in Europe worst affected by the virus. It is currently rolling out the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccinewhich was approved for EU member states last week. What are the Christmas restrictions around Europe? Covid vaccine approved for use in EU's 27 states In an interview with La Sexta television on Monday, Mr Illa emphasised that vaccination would not be mandatory. ""What will be done is a register, which will be shared with our European partners... of those people who have been offered it and have simply rejected it,"" he said. ""It is not a document which will be made public and it will be done with the utmost respect for data protection."" He added: ""People who are offered a therapy that they refuse for any reason, it will be noted in the register... that there is no error in the system, not to have given this person the possibility of being vaccinated."" According to a recent poll, the number of Spanish citizens who have said they will not take the vaccine has fallen to 28% from 47% in November. This video can not be played How will the new Pfizer vaccine work? In other comments on Monday, Mr Illa said people would be contacted by regional authorities when it was their turn to be inoculated. ""People who decide not to get vaccinated, which we think is a mistake, are within their rights,"" he told reporters. ""We are going to try to solve doubts. Getting vaccinated saves lives, it is the way out of this pandemic."" The number of people who have died from Covid-19 in Spain rose above the 50,000 mark on Monday. The country has registered more than 1.8 million infections during the pandemic. Spain is under a nationwide curfew, between 23:00 and 06:00, until early May. In many places, people are only allowed out in that period to go to work, buy medicine, or to care for elderly people or children. Regional leaders can modify curfew times and can also close regional borders for travel. CHRISTMAS:What are the Christmas restrictions around Europe?

"London Ambulance Service received as many emergency calls on 26 December as it did at the height of the first wave of Covid-19 England's ""very high"" Covid infection level is a ""growing concern"" as the NHS struggles to cope with rising patient numbers, a health official has said. On Monday, a record 41,385 Covid cases and 357 deathswere reported in the UK,external. NHS England said the number of people being treated for the virus in hospital is now 20,426, which is higher than the previous peak of about 19,000 in April. Health officials in Wales and Scotland have also said they are at risk of becoming overwhelmed. Monday's figure for new cases is the highest daily number reported by the UK government, and the first time the daily total has surpassed 40,000. It is thought the infection rate was much higher during the first peak in April, but testing capacity was too limited to detect the true number. Some data over the Christmas period is incomplete, as a result of certain services being paused. BBC health editor Hugh Pym said Monday's figure included some infections where reporting was delayed, but that officials did not deny there had been a significant increase in infections. Dr Yvonne Doyle, medical director at Public Health England, said: ""This very high level of infection is of growing concern at a time when our hospitals are at their most vulnerable, with new admissions rising in many regions."" ""Despite unprecedented levels of infection, there is hope on the horizon,"" she added. Dr Doyle urged members of the public to ""continue to play our part in stopping the spread of the virus"" as the Pfizer/BioNTech coronavirus vaccine is rolled out. Hospitals in Wales, Scotland and the south of England have reported rising pressure on their services as the number of Covid patients increases. Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Woolwich, south-east London, said on Monday that an ""internal incident"" over its ""high number of Covid-positive patients"" had been ongoing since Sunday. ""All our patients have received the treatment they need, including intensive care treatment for Covid-19 and oxygen therapy as required. ""We are continuing to monitor the situation to ensure that this remains the case,"" a spokesperson for Lewisham and Greenwich NHS Trust said. Two stats stand out today and underline the extent of the pressure on the NHS. One is the more than 20,000 Covid patients in English hospitals, more than the peak in the first wave in April. In many ways it is even tougher for hospitals now, as they are trying to clear the backlog on non-urgent operations and procedures cancelled in the first wave - as well as cope with the surge in Covid numbers. It is worth pointing out though that one reason for the high level of patients is that some are there thanks to drugs and therapies discovered in the past year who might not have survived in the first wave. The other key statistic is the 41,385 new daily reported cases - by far the highest number since the testing system was fully established in the summer. Some sadly will become seriously ill after a week or so which points to even greater strain on hospitals in the new year. The president of the Royal College of Emergency Medicine said she saw ""wall to wall Covid"" when she worked at one London hospital on Christmas Day. Dr Katherine Henderson told the BBC there was a ""great deal of difficulty"" getting patients into wards. She added: ""The chances are that we will cope, but we cope at a cost - the cost is not doing what we had hoped, which is being able to keep non-Covid activities going."" Covid hospital pressures in Wales 'incredibly challenging' NHS faces being 'overwhelmed' warn health leaders Danny Mortimer, chief executive of the NHS Confederation, told BBC News disruption to non-urgent care in both hospitals and other health services was ""inevitable"" as infections rise. About half of the health boards in Wales have already cancelled non-urgent care, according to the director of the Welsh NHS Confederation. Darren Hughes told BBC Radio 4's PM programme the situation in Welsh hospitals was ""incredibly serious, and worsening"", with some intensive care units already at capacity. Public Health Wales' Dr Giri Shankar said large numbers of patients, and staff sickness, have createdan ""incredibly challenging"" situation. And doctors have warnedScotland's health system is ""severely stretched"". Infection rates in England are currently highest in areas of Essex, London and other parts of the South East. Parts of Essex haverecorded the highest weekly coronavirus case ratessince the pandemic began. In the week leading up to 21 December, Brentwood, Epping Forest and Thurrock all had rates of more than 1,350 cases per 100,000 people. Tracey Fletcher, the chief executive of Homerton hospital in east London, said her staff were ""extremely busy"" andurged people to comply,externalwith the tier four restrictions in force. As of 24 December, London, the South East, and the East of England had the greatest proportion of new variant cases Patricia Marquis, regional director of the Royal College of Nursing in south-east England, said the number of beds and staff available at hospitals in her area was ""really close to the edge"". ""We are getting to the point where it does feel like there is a possibility that hospitals will become overrun,"" she told Radio 4's PM programme. Ms Marquis said the strain on staffing meant nurses were looking after ""far more patients"" than usual and ""it does feel unsafe at times for them"". The South Central Ambulance Service (SCAS) said it has warned the military and fire service that paramedics may soon need their support. SCAS, which serves Berkshire, Oxfordshire, Buckinghamshire and Hampshire, said it had seen a threefold increase in 111 calls over the Christmas period, along with a 60-70% increase in staff absences as a result of showing Covid symptoms or having to self-isolate. This chart, using data up to 23 December, shows how hospital admissions had been rising in London Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove said the government's tiered system for coronavirus rules in England was the ""right strategy"" to tackle coronavirus, but accepted the NHS was under pressure and there were ""difficult months ahead"". Some 24 million people in the south-east and east of England - about 43% of the population - are now living under the strictest tier four rules and a review on 30 December could see more areas placed under the restrictions. Mainland Scotland entered level four restrictions from Saturday for three weeks, and similar rules are in place in Wales. Northern Ireland has also entered a new six-week lockdown. New coronavirus variant: What do we know? London 999 calls as high as Covid first wave peak The BBC has been told the London Ambulance Service (LAS) received7,918 emergency calls on 26 December- as many as at the height of the first wave of Covid-19. An LAS memo said the rising demand was down to the ""rapid spread of the new variant of the Covid-19 virus"". Figures seen by the BBC show at one London hospital on Sunday morning, ambulance crews were typically waiting nearly six hours to hand over patients to staff.

"NHS England's chief executive said the NHS had ""brilliantly"" looked after 200,000 severely ill Covid-19 patients Health workers are ""back in the eye of the storm"" as coronavirus cases continue to rise, NHS England's chief executive Simon Stevens has said. It has been the ""toughest year"" for the NHS, which has treated 200,000 severely ill Covid-19 patients, he added. Hospitals in England are currently treating more Covid patients than at the peak of the first wave in April. A government scientific adviser has warned national restrictions are needed to prevent a ""catastrophe"". On Monday, a record 41,385 new Covid cases werereported in the UK,external, though it is thought the infection rate was higher during spring when testing was much more limited. NHS England said 20,426 people were being treated for the virus in hospitals in England on Monday, which ishigher than the previous peak of about 19,000 in April. Health officials in Wales and Scotland have also said they are at risk of becoming overwhelmed. Concern at 'unprecedented' English infection level Covid hospital pressures 'incredibly challenging' NHS faces being 'overwhelmed' warn health leaders The spread of the new coronavirus variant means the UK is ""entering a very dangerous new phase of the pandemic"", according to Prof Andrew Hayward, a member of the government's New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group (Nervtag). He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""We're going to need decisive, early, national action to prevent a catastrophe in January and February."" The ""50% increase in transmissibility"" of the new variant means that ""the previous levels of restrictions that worked before won't work now, and so tier four restrictions are likely to be necessary - or even higher than that"", he added. Tier four - England's toughest level of coronavirus restrictions, currently in place in parts of east and south-east England - includes a ""stay at home"" order and non-essential shops having to close. Prof Hayward said: ""I think we're really looking at a situation where we're moving into near lockdown."" He added that he thought schools would have to return ""maybe a little bit later"" but that having schools open would mean ""we're going to have to have increased, strict restrictions in other areas of society to pay for that"". Two stats underline the extent of the pressure on the NHS. One is the more than 20,000 Covid patients in English hospitals, more than the peak in the first wave in April. In many ways it is even tougher for hospitals now, as they are trying to clear the backlog on non-urgent operations and procedures cancelled in the first wave - as well as cope with the surge in Covid numbers. It is worth pointing out, though, that one reason for the high level of patients is that some are there thanks to drugs and therapies discovered in the past year who might not have survived in the first wave. The other key statistic is the 41,385 new daily reported cases - by far the highest number since the testing system was fully established in the summer. Some sadly will become seriously ill after a week or so - which points to even greater strain on hospitals in the new year. In a new year message to staff recorded at a vaccination centre, Sir Simon, the NHS England chief executive, said Covid-19 meant 2020 had probably been ""the toughest year most of us can remember"" - and certainly in the health service. ""Many of us have lost family, friends, colleagues and - at a time of year when we would normally be celebrating - a lot of people are understandably feeling anxious, frustrated and tired. ""And now again we are back in the eye of the storm with a second wave of coronavirus sweeping Europe and, indeed, this country."" This video can not be played ""Now is the right time... to record our enormous debt of gratitude,"" says NHS England boss Sir Simon Stevens He said the pandemic had shown ""sometimes the worst of circumstances bring out the best in people"", which he said was ""certainly true across the health service"". He also said that by late spring he expected the NHS to have offered vaccinations to all vulnerable people, which offered ""the biggest chink of hope"" for 2021. Hospitals in Wales, Scotland and the south of England have reported rising pressure on their services as the number of Covid patients increases. Prof Steve Hams, a chief nurse at Gloucestershire Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, said the situation was becoming ""increasingly challenging"" and staff were becoming ""increasingly exhausted"". He told BBC Breakfast: ""We felt during April that there would be an end to this but actually we're now seeing a third peak so trying to keep our colleagues and our teams going through this time is just incredibly difficult."" Dr Sonia Adesara, an A&E doctor in London, told the same programme that her hospital had seen ""a massive rise"" in people with Covid arriving in the past week, describing it as ""an extremely serious situation"". She said: ""The situation is untenable and I think we are very close to becoming overwhelmed."" However, she added that compared to April, medical staff were getting much better and more experienced at treating the virus. A PROMISED LAND:Barack Obama reads from his new and compelling presidential memoir GROUNDED WITH LOUIS THEROUX:Ruby Wax talks about turning her back on television Meanwhile, members of the armed forces will be on standbyto help roll out mass testing to secondary schools and colleges in England from next month.

"This video can not be played Natasha spoke to the BBC in April after coming close to death In April, BBC Wales reported on a student nurse who almost died with Covid-19. In a video of her emotional reunion with her children the then 35-year-old could not walk without a frame. Kate Rimmington spoke to her about what has happened since. Spending three weeks in a coma on a ventilator fighting the virus put an unexpected brake on Natasha Jenkins' second year of nurse training - but it did not put an end to it. In April, a video of herreturning home and hugging her childrenCodie, Elise, and Oakley, then aged 16, 12, and six, was viewed worldwide. It led rock singer Rod Stewart to get in touch with a gift of Â£5,000 to ""help you through the rough times"". Natasha, who had an existing health conditionIdiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH),external, first became ill just before Mother's Day, before being hospitalised in the middle of the night and taken to intensive care. Natasha said she would be forever grateful to the ""amazing staff"" at Cardiff's University Hospital of Wales for saving her life For weeks Natasha's children were looked after by her parents. No-one could say whether the single mum would survive. ""They told my family it was hour by hour,"" she said in April. She got through the worst and returned home to Barry, Vale of Glamorgan, where she faced the task of getting better - and completing her second year of her degree. The course was put on hold for 12 weeks so her fellow students could get to work helping with the deluge of patients caused by the first wave of coronavirus - but Natasha was able to use this time to start her recovery. She was warned this could take six to 12 months, given she was struggling to walk and suffering crippling fatigue. But the pandemic meant much of her degree tuition went online, so she was able to study in bed - with six-year-old Oakley, who had particularly struggled with her absence, glued to her side for two months. Incredibly, she managed to pass the second year at the same time as her peers, and is now in her third year and back training at Cardiff's University Hospital of Wales. ""I was just so determined and I knew I had to put my all into it,"" the former GP receptionist said. New additions Teddy and Bear have accompanied Natasha on her walks to build up her stamina and improve her breathing Eight months on, she is not fully recovered, but is much better. ""I've had loads of follow up. I said to the psychologist, 'I just feel lucky that I'm here'. I count my blessings really. I've really tried to keep a positive mindset. ""My breathing is still affected, my lungs are a bit distended but it's to be expected after what I went through."" Rod Stewart's gift came at the same time as ""amazing support"" from her family, friends and community The family got two dogs to accompany Natasha on her walks to improve her breathing and strengthen her legs, and she has finished her physiotherapy. She still has some problems with her concentration and memory - she is due a neurological check up in the new year - and the virus has affected her knee joints. She also needs a scan on her throat, because doctors think the tracheotomy scar - from the breathing tube that kept her alive - is affecting her voice and ability to clear her throat. The children are doing ""really well"", but after such a ""rubbish year"" they decided to put the Christmas tree up in October for some early festive cheer - and the gift from Rod Stewart is helping to pay for a holiday abroad for them all next year. Natasha is now much better and working up to longer shifts on a surgical ward as she completes her nurse training She was ""gobsmacked"" at his generosity, which had followed ""amazing"" support from her family and friends, and acts of kindness from strangers who left hampers, flowers and chocolates on her doorstep. For now her goal is to qualify. She is currently working on a surgical ward on half shifts spread across the week while she builds her stamina back up, and again has had ""amazing"" help from her colleagues there. She hopes she will be able to manage the full 12-and-a-half hour shifts by May. She said: ""The ITU consultant said 'We don't know if you could get it again. You might have a worse dose.' ""But I've dealt with it. I'm not feeling anxious. The ward staff have been more worried than me. ""I thought either I go back and front it, or waste all my training.""

"This video can not be played Pierre Cardin: The designer ""one step ahead of tomorrow"" Legendary designer Pierre Cardin, whose futuristic and stylish designs helped revolutionise fashion in the 1950s and 60s, has died at the age of 98. The French fashion giant, whose career spanned more than 70 years, helped usher in the post-war ""golden age"" of couture with his modern style. He broke ground by bringing designer styles to the masses with some of the first ready-to-wear collections. A business pioneer, he also licensed his name for a wide range of products. Obituary: Pierre Cardin In pictures: Pierre Cardin's life in fashion He died in hospital in Neuilly, near Paris, his family told the AFP news agency. ""It is a day of great sadness for all our family. Pierre Cardin is no more,"" they said in a statement. ""We are all proud of his tenacious ambition and the daring he has shown throughout his life."" After the news was announced, his official Instagram account posted one of his quotes: ""I have always worked in my own style, which is different from all others. It was always my intention to be different, because that is the only way to last."" Allow Instagram content? This article contains content provided by Instagram.

The fashion world paid tribute, with fellow French designerJean-Paul Gaultier thanking him,externalfor ""opening the doors to fashion and for making my dream possible"". Elle magazine editor-in-chief and Project Runway judgeNina Garcia said,externalCardin's designs showed ""how fashion has the power to design the future"". She wrote,external: ""His curiosity, his vision and his love for the art of fashion helped shape the dreams of many women during the second half of the 20th Century. ""Even today his designs are truly modern, with silhouettes and fabrics that have inspired many contemporary designers."" BBC Culture: The influences of 60s space-age fashions Benetton artistic director Jean-Charles de Castelbajac said Cardin was an ""a very extraordinary man"" who did not set borders between fashion, design or architecture. He told AFP that ""his inspiration boosted my imagination"", and that for Cardin, the marketing and promotion of his art ""was as important as the art itself"". Photographer and former modelNigel Barker tweeted,external: ""We have lost a legend... Fashion Designer Pierre Cardin who revolutionized the industry with his futuristic designs and think outside of the box business approach has passed away today."" Cardin's helmet-like hats were inspired by the sci-fi fantasies and space race of the 1960s Cardin was born in Italy in 1922 but moved to France as a child. He began his fashion career in Paris working for firms including Christian Dior, for whom he helped create the New Look collection in 1947. He set up his own fashion company in 1950 and made his name with visionary designs like the iconic bubble dress in 1954 and his Space Age collection in 1964. At the end of the 1950s, he launched his first ready-to-wear collection for the Printemps department store. While pop stars and actors like the Beatles and Lauren Bacall were seen wearing Cardin, his cutting-edge designs were also within reach of ordinary customers. Cardin with models in 1962 With a savvy business sense, he also came to recognise the appeal of the name on the label, and allowed his to be used on goods ranging from sunglasses to perfume, pens and food. However, to some, that expansion diluted the appeal of his core business. Justine Picardie, contributing editor of Harper's Bazaar magazine, told BBC Radio 4's The World At One: ""He became synonymous with those global licensing deals - anything from ties and pens to cars. ""He was also synonymous with the popularisation and democratisation of fashion, and with this idea of the space age."" Cardin also set his sights on a new globalised world market, presenting a collection in Communist China in 1979, and Moscow's Red Square in 1991.

"The EU and China are close to reaching a long-awaited business investment deal, according to media reports. The pact, expected to be finalised this week, will give EU firms better access to the Chinese market and improve competition conditions. Talks on the investment deal began in 2014 but have been stuck for years over a number of issues. But rising trade tensions between the US and China may have helped change the Chinese position, officials said. The deal comes hot on the heels of the UK's post-Brexit trade agreement with the EU which was announced on 24 December. UK set for 'bumpy' period as new EU rules come in Chinese economy 'to overtake US by 2028' US blacklists companies with possible military ties According to multiple reports, the deal would open up China's manufacturing sector to EU companies, as well as construction, advertising, air transport and telecoms. One of the sticking points was China's demands for access to the EU's energy market given sensitivities over national security. The deal is expected to give Beijing access to a small part of the European renewable energy sector on a reciprocal basis. The pact is also designed to remove barriers to investment in China such as joint-venture requirements and caps on foreign ownership in certain industries. Once the expected deal is reached, it needs to be ratified by the European parliament, a process that may not begin until the second half of 2021. This video can not be played How US and China's break-up could affect the world On Monday, the European Commission reported progress on the talks with Beijing, including the core issue of workers' rights in China. This is a contentious issue given reports that China uses Uighur Muslims detained in large numbers in the Xinjiang province as forced labour. Beijing denies these claims. Under the agreement, China is being asked to pledge to subscribe to the International Labour Organisation's rules on forced labour. An EU-China agreement is expected to cause frictions with the incoming administration of US president-elect Joe Biden. Earlier this month the EU published a transatlantic strategy in which it urged the US to work with it to meet the ""strategic challenge"" posed by China. China and the US have been locked in a trade war since 2018 and the Trump administration has targeted a number of Chinese tech companies as threats to national security. EU-China relations themselves have been strained this year, over China's imposition of a new security law in Hong Kong and accusations it spread disinformation about the coronavirus.

"Teaching moved online on Monday in Wales Children will return to school on a staggered basis after the Christmas break, the Welsh Local Government Association has said. Online learning will continue at the beginning of term and schools will provide face-to-face learning for the majority of their pupils by 11 January. A full return to the classroom is expected by 18 January at the latest. The WLGA said minimising disruption was a priority, but teachers' union NASUWT criticised the short notice given. General secretary Patrick Roach said: ""Yet again ministers are announcing significant changes affecting schools with little or no time to prepare before the Christmas closure period. ""This decision demonstrates that Covid-19 transmission in schools is a major factor in continuing the spread of the virus."" He added more action was needed to keep pupils, staff and their families safe. Laura Doel from the NAHT union added: ""Yet again schools are expected to pick up the pieces of a last-minute announcement on school reopening.Â ""The result... will be an inconsistent picture across Wales that lacks clarity and leaves headteachers to have to deal with the fallout from parents who are justifiably angry about the uncertainty."" The measures will give schools time to put more safety measures in place, the WLGA says Meanwhile, First Minister Mark Drakeford predicted other parts of the UK may need to follow Wales' lead inintroducing lockdown measures after Christmas. Speaking to the BBC's Newscast podcast, he said: ""As soon as you begin to lessen restrictions this virus finds a way to begin circulating again,"" adding other parts of the UK ""will find themselves with numbers escalating and more action needing to be taken"". ""The advice from SAGE has always been that the earlier you act and the more sharply you act the better the impact will be,"" he added. The news about the staggered return of pupils comes after aplan to introduce lateral flow tests to schoolswas announced, so contacts of people who have tested positive can continue going to school if they test negative daily for the duration of their 10-day isolation period. Secondary schoolsmoved online on Monday for the rest of this term, and primary schools subsequently chose to follow suit. Arrangements will be made for vulnerable learners and the children of critical workers. Two household limit at Christmas to be made law How many deaths have there been? A-levels and GCSE assessment schedule outlined A WLGA spokesman said: ""The plan to return to schools in January will give some certainty, whilst also allowing for flexibility to take account of local circumstances. ""Teachers, school staff, learners, and parents and carers' response has been remarkable throughout this challenging year. ""It has not been easy, and we thank them for their continued patience and perseverance to help keep our communities safe."" The Welsh Government said the flexible approach would enable schools to make safety arrangements for their own circumstances. ""We know from our children and young people that they learn best when in the classroom receiving face-to-face learning, so any measures we put in place must look to minimise further disruption to their education,"" it added. The WLGA said some councils had opted for inset days on 4 and 5 January. Powys council confirmed this was the case in its area, with all pupils returning on 6 January, meanwhile Cardiff and Ceredigion said in emails to parents they expected all pupils back by 11 January. Cardiff council leader Huw Thomas said: ""What we've seen in recent weeks in all parts of Wales really is increasing numbers of pupils and staff being asked to self isolate and... that is having a real impact on the viability of actually being able to open schools. ""So I think what's being proposed here... recognises the reality."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

One head teacher tweeted: ""If anyone, anywhere has any thought that schools are safe tell that to my staff who are so ill at the moment and caught it IN SCHOOL."" Chris Britten, head of Ysgol y Deri, added it was time the Welsh Government ""started thinking of the school staff as well as the pupils"". But Sally Holland, children's commissioner for Wales, said she was not able to support further delays to in-school learning, except for individual schools in exceptional circumstances. ""Children and young people have told me that online learning, however well planned, is no substitute for being in the classroom. ""It clearly places already disadvantaged groups at a further disadvantage."" It follows asimilar move in England, where secondary schools will have a staggered return after the break.

"The elderly are among those receiving the first wave of vaccinations in Spain Spain is to set up a register of people who refuse to be vaccinated against coronavirus and share it with other European Union nations, the health minister has said. Salvador Illa said the list would not be made accessible to the public or to employers. He said the way to defeat the virus was ""to vaccinate all of us - the more the better"". Spain has been one of the countries in Europe worst affected by the virus. It is currently rolling out the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccinewhich was approved for EU member states last week. What are the Christmas restrictions around Europe? Covid vaccine approved for use in EU's 27 states In an interview with La Sexta television on Monday, Mr Illa emphasised that vaccination would not be mandatory. ""What will be done is a register, which will be shared with our European partners... of those people who have been offered it and have simply rejected it,"" he said. ""It is not a document which will be made public and it will be done with the utmost respect for data protection."" He added: ""People who are offered a therapy that they refuse for any reason, it will be noted in the register... that there is no error in the system, not to have given this person the possibility of being vaccinated."" According to a recent poll, the number of Spanish citizens who have said they will not take the vaccine has fallen to 28% from 47% in November. This video can not be played How will the new Pfizer vaccine work? In other comments on Monday, Mr Illa said people would be contacted by regional authorities when it was their turn to be inoculated. ""People who decide not to get vaccinated, which we think is a mistake, are within their rights,"" he told reporters. ""We are going to try to solve doubts. Getting vaccinated saves lives, it is the way out of this pandemic."" The number of people who have died from Covid-19 in Spain rose above the 50,000 mark on Monday. The country has registered more than 1.8 million infections during the pandemic. Spain is under a nationwide curfew, between 23:00 and 06:00, until early May. In many places, people are only allowed out in that period to go to work, buy medicine, or to care for elderly people or children. Regional leaders can modify curfew times and can also close regional borders for travel. CHRISTMAS:What are the Christmas restrictions around Europe?

"Russia has reported over 3.1 million infections from coronavirus Russia's deputy prime minister has revealed more than 80% of excess deaths this year are linked to Covid-19, which would mean its death toll is three times higher than previously reported. Excess deaths are the difference between the total number of deaths registered and the average over the previous years for the same period. Official figures say 55,827 people have died with Covid-19 in Russia. The deputy prime minister said excess deaths would take that to 186,000. Countries use different methods when reporting deaths related to the virus, which makes international comparisons difficult. Russia has been criticised for calculating its official deaths from Covid-19 based on the number of post-mortem examinations that list coronavirus as the main cause of death. However, this means that other deaths linked to Covid-19, which did not list it as the main cause of death, will not have been included. The new numbers mean Russia's coronavirus death toll could be the world's third-highest, after the US with 335,000 deaths and Brazil, which has had 192,000, according toa tally by Johns Hopkins University.,external More than 3.1 million infections have been reported in the country. This video can not be played In December the BBC's Sarah Rainsford went to a Moscow clinic where the Sputnik V vaccine was being given to patients Deputy Prime Minister Tatiana Golikova said mortality in the first 11 months of 2020 had been 13.8% higher than the previous year. Based on her announcement, that would mean that more than 186,057 deaths were linked directly or indirectly to coronavirus. According to Rosstat, the Russian statistics agency, 229,700 more people had died this year from all causes. But Ms Golikova was adamant the Russian government had never hidden mortality data. ""I would like to draw attention to the fact that over 81% of that rise in mortality which took place in that period can be attributed to Covid-19 and the effects of the virus,"" she said. Sputnik V vaccine rushed out to wary Russians EU starts mass vaccination in 'moment of unity' Coronavirus variants: The science explained Coronavirus-linked deaths in Russia were higher in November than at any time this year. She said December as well as November were worse than previous months because Covid infections were increasing in conjunction with other diseases during the autumn and winter period. President Vladimir Putin has hailed the country's healthcare system as more effective than the rest of the world in tackling the virus, however hospitals in many areas of the country have struggled to cope with the rise in patients. Russia has pinned its hopes on the Sputnik V vaccine, which has now been exported to Belarus, Argentina and Hungary, although it has not been approved by the European Union's Medicines Agency (EMA). This video can not be played What a pandemic Christmas looked like around the world Vaccinations with the drug began in Belarus on Tuesday, with seven medics receiving the drug at a clinic in Minsk. Some 700,000 doses have so far been released in Russia, although surveys indicate take-up of the drug could be below 40%. In other developments around Europe: The number of coronavirus-related deaths inGermanyhas passed 30,000 InSpain, where fatalities have topped 50,000, a big consignment of 369,000 doses of the Pfizer-Biontech vaccine finally arrived on Tuesday after being held up by bad weather Spanish health minister Salvador Illa has revealeda register will be kept of people who refuse to get vaccinated InFrance, the mayor of the eastern city of Nancy, Mathieu Klein, has called for a local lockdown: ""The situation at Nancy hospital has deteriorated drastically as we now have a 50% rise in Covid patients"" The ex-head of theDutchpublic health agency has condemned the country's vaccine strategy as embarrassing.

"People in parts of Dumfries and Galloway are being urged to stay at home as much as possible after a Covid outbreak more than doubled in two days. The new B.1.1.7 variant has been identified as being part of the outbreak in Wigtownshire, which grew from 64 cases on Boxing Day to 142. It has also been identified in lower Annandale. Health officials have asked people in these regions to ""go beyond"" the level four restrictions where possible. They have asked people to stay at home as much as possible to limit the spread locally and to other parts of the region. And they have warned that it could have an impact on wider local health services. New Covid strain driving 'rapid increase' in cases New strain Covid cases 'very concerning' Of the 154 tests carried out in Stranraer on Sunday, 55 were positive - the biggest increase in Covid cases seen in one area of Dumfries and Galloway since the start of the pandemic. Health officials said they expected to see more cases appearing and extra testing was being put in place in Stranraer from 29 December to 4 January. They are also concerned about a ""growing number"" of cases in lower Annandale, where the new variant has also been identified. Interim Director of Public Health Valerie White said: ""This is a rapidly evolving situation where we expect to see more cases appearing.  At the current rate of spread, there is a very serious concern about how this will impact on services. ""In the days to come, a percentage of people among these newly diagnosed Covid cases will grow ill and the number of people needing hospitalisation is likely to increase - potentially impacting on our ability to provide help to those people who need it for any number of other non-Covid reasons - whether that's heart attacks, strokes, car accidents, etc. ""It's therefore vital that everyone follows the level four directions and the FACTS guidance about use of face coverings, hand hygiene and physical distancing and social interaction."" She added: ""Covid does not just impact on those who develop the coronavirus, or who experience the worst of its symptoms - at this rate of increase, the effect of its rapid spread could be felt by anyone across the entire community."" She urged people to ""be conscious of the threat posed at new year, and consider the potential consequences both personally and community-wide"". The B.1.1.7 variant of Covid-19is up to 70% more transmissible and is viewed as being responsible for significant volumes of cases in south east England. The variant has 17 mutations, where the virus has changed, with some of these changes making it more infectious in lower doses. Along with the rest of mainland Scotland, Dumfries and Galloway has been moved to level four restrictions to try and curb the spread of infection. It means non-essential shops, pubs and restaurants are closed - except for takeaways and click-and-collect - and there are restrictions on people travelling outside their local authority boundaries.

"This video can not be played President-elect Biden accuses the Trump administration of ""irresponsibility"" over national security US President-elect Joe Biden has accused the US defence department of ""irresponsibility"" for failing to give his team the information it needs for the transition of power. He said his team had encountered ""obstruction from the political leadership"". Mr Biden also claimed that agencies critical to US security had suffered ""enormous damage"" under Donald Trump. A Pentagon spokesman said it had been ""completely transparent"". Mr Biden takes office on 20 January but President Trump has refused to concede. For weeks after the 3 November election, Mr Biden was blocked from receiving key intelligence briefings, an essential and normally routine part of a presidential transition. After Mr Trump finally agreed to allow the formal transition process last month,Mr Biden praised the White House for its help in the process. But his tone had changed on Monday. Mr Biden spoke after a briefing by national security and foreign policy aides. In a speech which he posted on Twitter,external, Mr Biden said his team was facing ""roadblocks"" in the defence department and the Office of Management and Budget. ""Right now, we just aren't getting all the information that we need from the outgoing administration in key national security areas,"" he said. ""It's nothing short, in my view, of irresponsibility."" The president-elect added that his team needed a ""clear picture of our force posture around the world"" and that US adversaries could exploit any confusion that resulted. What to expect when Biden is sworn in What Joe Biden wants to do The unstoppable rise of Kamala Harris Does Biden's new team better reflect America? Following Mr Biden's remarks, Acting Defence Secretary Christopher Miller said officials had been ""working with the utmost professionalism to support transition activities"". ""The Department of Defense has conducted 164 interviews with over 400 officials and provided over 5,000 pages of documents - far more than initially requested by Biden's transition team,"" he said. Thepresidential transition processis the handover of important information and duties from the outgoing administration to the president-elect and his or her team, ensuring that they are fully up to speed when they reach the White House on 20 January. Christopher Miller was appointed acting defence secretary by President Trump after he sacked Mark Esper The president-elect described key security agencies as having been ""hollowed out"" in personnel, capacity and morale. ""The policy processes have atrophied or have been sidelined,"" he added, saying that this was ""to the despair of our alliances"". Mr Trump sacked his Defence Secretary Mark Espershortly after the election, apparently over Mr Esper's disagreement with his call to deploy the military against anti-racism protesters. Mr Trump's subsequent installation of loyalists in the department was viewed with concern by political opponents, who saw it as an attempt to sow chaos in the final weeks of his administration. The president has not commented on Mr Biden's latest remarks. Mr Esper himself became defence secretary only in 2019. President Trump's first defence secretary was Gen Jim Mattis, who left the post after his views and the president's increasingly diverged. Other senior security officials who have left their positions in the Trump administration include Navy Secretary Richard Spencer, fired in November 2019, and John Bolton, who left his job as national security adviser in September 2019. He was the third person to hold that role under Mr Trump. The White House revolving door What time is Biden's inauguration?

"This video can not be played Natasha spoke to the BBC in April after coming close to death In April, BBC Wales reported on a student nurse who almost died with Covid-19. In a video of her emotional reunion with her children the then 35-year-old could not walk without a frame. Kate Rimmington spoke to her about what has happened since. Spending three weeks in a coma on a ventilator fighting the virus put an unexpected brake on Natasha Jenkins' second year of nurse training - but it did not put an end to it. In April, a video of herreturning home and hugging her childrenCodie, Elise, and Oakley, then aged 16, 12, and six, was viewed worldwide. It led rock singer Rod Stewart to get in touch with a gift of Â£5,000 to ""help you through the rough times"". Natasha, who had an existing health conditionIdiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH),external, first became ill just before Mother's Day, before being hospitalised in the middle of the night and taken to intensive care. Natasha said she would be forever grateful to the ""amazing staff"" at Cardiff's University Hospital of Wales for saving her life For weeks Natasha's children were looked after by her parents. No-one could say whether the single mum would survive. ""They told my family it was hour by hour,"" she said in April. She got through the worst and returned home to Barry, Vale of Glamorgan, where she faced the task of getting better - and completing her second year of her degree. The course was put on hold for 12 weeks so her fellow students could get to work helping with the deluge of patients caused by the first wave of coronavirus - but Natasha was able to use this time to start her recovery. She was warned this could take six to 12 months, given she was struggling to walk and suffering crippling fatigue. But the pandemic meant much of her degree tuition went online, so she was able to study in bed - with six-year-old Oakley, who had particularly struggled with her absence, glued to her side for two months. Incredibly, she managed to pass the second year at the same time as her peers, and is now in her third year and back training at Cardiff's University Hospital of Wales. ""I was just so determined and I knew I had to put my all into it,"" the former GP receptionist said. New additions Teddy and Bear have accompanied Natasha on her walks to build up her stamina and improve her breathing Eight months on, she is not fully recovered, but is much better. ""I've had loads of follow up. I said to the psychologist, 'I just feel lucky that I'm here'. I count my blessings really. I've really tried to keep a positive mindset. ""My breathing is still affected, my lungs are a bit distended but it's to be expected after what I went through."" Rod Stewart's gift came at the same time as ""amazing support"" from her family, friends and community The family got two dogs to accompany Natasha on her walks to improve her breathing and strengthen her legs, and she has finished her physiotherapy. She still has some problems with her concentration and memory - she is due a neurological check up in the new year - and the virus has affected her knee joints. She also needs a scan on her throat, because doctors think the tracheotomy scar - from the breathing tube that kept her alive - is affecting her voice and ability to clear her throat. The children are doing ""really well"", but after such a ""rubbish year"" they decided to put the Christmas tree up in October for some early festive cheer - and the gift from Rod Stewart is helping to pay for a holiday abroad for them all next year. Natasha is now much better and working up to longer shifts on a surgical ward as she completes her nurse training She was ""gobsmacked"" at his generosity, which had followed ""amazing"" support from her family and friends, and acts of kindness from strangers who left hampers, flowers and chocolates on her doorstep. For now her goal is to qualify. She is currently working on a surgical ward on half shifts spread across the week while she builds her stamina back up, and again has had ""amazing"" help from her colleagues there. She hopes she will be able to manage the full 12-and-a-half hour shifts by May. She said: ""The ITU consultant said 'We don't know if you could get it again. You might have a worse dose.' ""But I've dealt with it. I'm not feeling anxious. The ward staff have been more worried than me. ""I thought either I go back and front it, or waste all my training.""

"This video can not be played Natasha spoke to the BBC in April after coming close to death In April, BBC Wales reported on a student nurse who almost died with Covid-19. In a video of her emotional reunion with her children the then 35-year-old could not walk without a frame. Kate Rimmington spoke to her about what has happened since. Spending three weeks in a coma on a ventilator fighting the virus put an unexpected brake on Natasha Jenkins' second year of nurse training - but it did not put an end to it. In April, a video of herreturning home and hugging her childrenCodie, Elise, and Oakley, then aged 16, 12, and six, was viewed worldwide. It led rock singer Rod Stewart to get in touch with a gift of Â£5,000 to ""help you through the rough times"". Natasha, who had an existing health conditionIdiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH),external, first became ill just before Mother's Day, before being hospitalised in the middle of the night and taken to intensive care. Natasha said she would be forever grateful to the ""amazing staff"" at Cardiff's University Hospital of Wales for saving her life For weeks Natasha's children were looked after by her parents. No-one could say whether the single mum would survive. ""They told my family it was hour by hour,"" she said in April. She got through the worst and returned home to Barry, Vale of Glamorgan, where she faced the task of getting better - and completing her second year of her degree. The course was put on hold for 12 weeks so her fellow students could get to work helping with the deluge of patients caused by the first wave of coronavirus - but Natasha was able to use this time to start her recovery. She was warned this could take six to 12 months, given she was struggling to walk and suffering crippling fatigue. But the pandemic meant much of her degree tuition went online, so she was able to study in bed - with six-year-old Oakley, who had particularly struggled with her absence, glued to her side for two months. Incredibly, she managed to pass the second year at the same time as her peers, and is now in her third year and back training at Cardiff's University Hospital of Wales. ""I was just so determined and I knew I had to put my all into it,"" the former GP receptionist said. New additions Teddy and Bear have accompanied Natasha on her walks to build up her stamina and improve her breathing Eight months on, she is not fully recovered, but is much better. ""I've had loads of follow up. I said to the psychologist, 'I just feel lucky that I'm here'. I count my blessings really. I've really tried to keep a positive mindset. ""My breathing is still affected, my lungs are a bit distended but it's to be expected after what I went through."" Rod Stewart's gift came at the same time as ""amazing support"" from her family, friends and community The family got two dogs to accompany Natasha on her walks to improve her breathing and strengthen her legs, and she has finished her physiotherapy. She still has some problems with her concentration and memory - she is due a neurological check up in the new year - and the virus has affected her knee joints. She also needs a scan on her throat, because doctors think the tracheotomy scar - from the breathing tube that kept her alive - is affecting her voice and ability to clear her throat. The children are doing ""really well"", but after such a ""rubbish year"" they decided to put the Christmas tree up in October for some early festive cheer - and the gift from Rod Stewart is helping to pay for a holiday abroad for them all next year. Natasha is now much better and working up to longer shifts on a surgical ward as she completes her nurse training She was ""gobsmacked"" at his generosity, which had followed ""amazing"" support from her family and friends, and acts of kindness from strangers who left hampers, flowers and chocolates on her doorstep. For now her goal is to qualify. She is currently working on a surgical ward on half shifts spread across the week while she builds her stamina back up, and again has had ""amazing"" help from her colleagues there. She hopes she will be able to manage the full 12-and-a-half hour shifts by May. She said: ""The ITU consultant said 'We don't know if you could get it again. You might have a worse dose.' ""But I've dealt with it. I'm not feeling anxious. The ward staff have been more worried than me. ""I thought either I go back and front it, or waste all my training.""

"Keyon Harrold said the incident had ""traumatised"" his son An investigation has been launched after a 14-year-old black teenager was allegedly assaulted by a white woman who falsely accused him of stealing her phone in a hotel lobby in New York. Grammy award-winning trumpeter Keyon Harrold posted a video online showing the woman, who has not been identified, repeatedly shouting at him and his son. Mr Harrold said the incident had ""traumatised"" his son. Mayor Bill de Blasio said: ""This is racism. Plain and simple."" In a tweet, he added: ""It would be horrific at any age, but it's especially offensive that it happened to a child."" The musician and his son, Keyon Harrold Jr, were staying at the Arlo Hotel in Manhattan when the confrontation took place. ""I hate I have to post this!!!"" he wrote on Instagram on Saturday. ""The lady in this video assaulted my 14-year-old son and me as we came down from our room in the Arlo Soho to get breakfast."" In the video, which has been viewed more than two million times,,externala woman wearing a face mask can be seen standing behind a hotel employee and lunging at Mr Harrold and his son after accusing the teenager of stealing her iPhone. Mr Harrold accused the woman of scratching him and tackling his son after he stopped filming. The phone was later returned by an Uber driver, according to the musician. Prosecutors in Manhattan are now investigating the incident. In an update posted to Mr Harrold's Instagram account, the family said they had decided to go public with the footage because of the hotel's response to the woman's behaviour. In a statement, Arlo Hotels said it was ""deeply disheartened about the recent incident of baseless accusation, prejudice and assault against an innocent guest"", adding that it apologised to Mr Harrold and his son.

"Japan plans a 2023 launch of the world's first satellite made out of wood. A Japanese company and Kyoto University have joined forces to develop what they hope will be the world's first satellites made out of wood by 2023. Sumitomo Forestry said it has started research on tree growth and the use of wood materials in space. The partnership will begin experimenting with different types of wood in extreme environments on Earth. Space junk is becoming an increasing problem as more satellites are launched into the atmosphere. Wooden satellites would burn up without releasing harmful substances into the atmosphere or raining debris on the ground when they plunge back to Earth. Orbiting space junk collision 'avoided' Balloon 'taxi service' to take satellites to space UK Space Agency funds tech for orbital awareness ""We are very concerned with the fact that all the satellites which re-enter the Earth's atmosphere burn and create tiny alumina particles which will float in the upper atmosphere for many years,"" Takao Doi, a professor at Kyoto University and Japanese astronaut, told the BBC. ""Eventually it will affect the environment of the Earth."" ""The next stage will be developing the engineering model of the satellite, then we will manufacture the flight model,"" Professor Doi added. As an astronaut he visited the International Space Station in March 2008. During this mission, he became the first person to throw a boomerang in space that had been specifically designed for use in microgravity. This video can not be played Tackling the Earth's orbiting space junk Sumitomo Forestry, part of the Sumitomo Group, which was founded more than 400 years ago, said it would work on developing wooden materials highly resistant to temperature changes and sunlight. The wood it is using is an ""R&D secret"" a spokesman for the company told the BBC. Experts have warned of the increasing threat of space junk falling to Earth, as more spacecraft and satellites are launched. Satellites are increasingly being used for communication, television, navigation and weather forecasting. Space experts and researchers have been investigating different options to remove and reduce the space junk. There are nearly 6,000 satellites circling Earth, according to the World Economic Forum (WEF). About 60% of them are defunct (space junk). Research firm Euroconsult estimates that 990 satellites will be launched every year this decade, which means that by 2028, there could be 15,000 satellites in orbit. Experts predict an increasing threat of space junk that will fall to Earth. Elon Musk's SpaceX has already launched more than 900 Starlink satellites and has plans to deploy thousands more. Space junk travels at an incredibly fast speed of more than 22,300 mph, so can have cause considerable damage to any objects it hits. In 2006 a tiny piece of space junk collided with the International Space Station, taking a chip out of the heavily reinforced window.

"India has the second-highest caseload in the world Six cases of the more contagious variant of Covid-19 first identified in the UK have been confirmed in India. The six individuals who returned from the UK are being kept in isolation, officials said on Tuesday. India joined a list of other countries last week in suspending flights to and from the UK. The new variant is considerably more transmissible than previous strains but not necessarily any more dangerous, experts say. With more than 10 million confirmed cases so far, India has the second-highest caseload in the world after the US. The new straincan ""cause havoc"" and ""throw our healthcare system out of control,""Dr A Fathahudeen, a critical care expert who has treated hundreds of Covid-19 patients, told the BBC earlier. New coronavirus variant: What do we know? New Covid strain: How worried should we be? Officials in India have begun contact-tracing close contacts and family members of the six who have tested positive for the new variant. Passengers arriving from the UK will undergo RT-PCR tests at all airports in the country, an official statement said. The samples found to be positive will then be genome sequenced by government-run labs in order to detect the new variant. Around 33,000 passengers arrived in India from the UK over the past month. Of those, 114 were found to be positive for coronavirus - their samples have been sent to ten labs for genome sequencing, according to the statement. News of thenew variant triggered travel restrictions around the worldlast week. Several countries such as Canada, Japan, Spain, Sweden and France have all confirmed the presence of the new strain. In the UK, health officials have warned that the country's ""very high"" Covid infection level is a ""growing concern"". On Monday, a record 41,385 Covid cases and 357 deaths were reported in the UK. The new, more contagious variant of Covid, first identified in the UK, has now been confirmed in more than 20 countries and territories around the world. While that is concerning, it's not surprising. The first case can be traced back to late September in the south of England, meaning there was ample time for it to spread undetected around the UK and into other countries. Now that the alarm has been raised, scientists around the globe are actively searching for and tracking this variant that is thought to pass more easily between people. And the more you seek, the more you can potentially find. More than 50 countries have imposed travel restrictions on Britain in recent days to help prevent more spread.

"This video can not be played People were seen singing and dancing at Bronte Beach on Christmas Day Australia's immigration minister has said that backpackers and other foreign visitors caught flouting public health restrictions could be deported. Alex Hawke said he was shocked by scenes from Sydney's Bronte Beach on Christmas Day. Videos of the gathering shared on social media showed hordes of young revellers singing and dancing in breach of coronavirus regulations. Some eyewitnesses said many of those present were British. Sydney is battling a new outbreak after months of no local cases. The virus's re-appearance a week before Christmas sparked a swift re-introduction of restrictions in the city, including clampdowns on holiday gatherings and a lockdown of the worst-affected region, the Northern Beaches. Sydney cut off from rest of Australia amid outbreak The outbreak has already grown to 129 cases. Most of the people present did not seem to be locals, witnesses said ""If somebody is threatening public safety or health, their visa can be cancelled and revoked,"" Mr Hawke tolda Sydney radio station,external. He said he had asked the federal Department of Home Affairs to work with New South Wales (NSW) state authorities in the lead up to New Year's Day so that anyone caught ""doing the wrong thing"" might have their visa status examined by the federal government. Most temporary visa holders were obeying public health orders, he later told ABC News. He did not specify how the government might track down rule breakers. None of the Bronte partygoers were fined or otherwise penalised, police said. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The Labor opposition also suggested the threat was a ""photo opp with no follow up"", given the department's already strained resources and backlog of immigration claims. Australia closed its borders to almost everyone except returning citizens or permanent residents and their families in March. People have also been granted exemptions to arrive in the country. Thegovernment said in April that there were over two million people in the country on temporary visas,externalat that time. On Christmas Day, hundreds of unmasked young people were seen drinking, dancing and singing in the park next to Bronte Beach, which neighbours the famous Bondi Beach in east Sydney. Holiday parties among backpackers in the tourist hotspot have been a common occurrence in other years. Witnesses told the BBC they believed the majority of revellers were from the UK or ""not Australian"". ""You could hear lots of clearly English accents, and several people were wearing the white English football jerseys,"" said Peter Hannam, a local journalist who had passed the crowds while on a walk with his family.

""We had to move through them on our path and the crowd was sort of pulsating... and well we thought we don't really want to hang around here because it doesn't look very safe."" He said a police squad and helicopter later arrived at the scene. Video shared on social media showed lingering groups carrying on with their activities as police circulated and tried to disperse people. NSW Police told the BBC that no penalties were issued to those attending the gathering. ""It was an operational decision at the time, there being so many people to deal with,"" said NSW Police spokesman Scott Willis. ""It's not always possible to take action against everyone there."" Police issued fines to other rule breakers on Christmas Day including guests at a house party in Bondi which was over capacity, and to a woman who drove out of her locked-down suburb for a Christmas visit. Reports of the gathering have sparked widespread community anger. Many Australians vented frustrations online, deeming the behaviour ""selfish"" in contrast to those who endured lockdown restrictions, or were otherwise separated from family over Christmas. NSW state health minister Brad Hazzard said the potential ""superspreader"" event undermined collective efforts. ""It is absolutely appalling to see what was clearly a group of people, a large gathering of people, who didn't give a damn about the rest of Sydney,"" he told reporters on Saturday. ""Many of those backpackers come here to Australia and are enjoying the relative freedoms we have here,"" he added. ""If they were in Europe right now, most of them would be in lockdown and not even allowed outside the front door."" This video can not be played Sydney beaches were closed for a few weeks in March during the first wave Others have also criticised the police response, arguing the partygoers had been let off far too easily, especially given how police have dealt with other transgressions. During a heavily-policed lockdown earlier this year, NSW Police issued A$1,000 (Â£560) fines for violations such as people venturing out of their lockdown zones and lingering in parks. In one case, a man was fined for eating a kebab on a bench - in breach of a stay-at-home order. Critics say the laws - which are applied with police discretion - have disproportionately affected poorer, marginalised communities. NSW Police declined to comment on these allegations. Similar criticism was also levelled at Victoria Police during Melbourne's lengthy lockdown.

"The pandemic has devastated the US economy and caused a surge in unemployment The US House of Representatives has voted in favour of increasing the aid sent to individuals under the new coronavirus stimulus package from $600 (Â£445) to $2,000. The Democratic-led House passed the bill with the support of more than 40 Republican members. President Donald Trump has championed the increased payments. However, the bigger relief package is likely to struggle in the Republican-led Senate. In another development on Monday, the House also voted tooverride President Trump's veto of a $740bn defence billthat was passed by Congress earlier this month. That bill also now moves to the Senate. Hunger spikes, demand rises for US food banks Unemployed in the US: 'I donât know what to do' Counting down the days to losing a home Although Democrats have a narrow majority in the House, Monday's votes both required two-thirds support to pass. On boosting the stimulus cheques, Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Republicans had a choice - ""vote for this legislation, or vote to deny the American people the bigger paycheques that they need"". Nancy Pelosi emphasised Mr Trump's support for the higher payments But many Republicans were concerned about the financial burden of increased payments. ""For me, I worry that this whopping $463bn won't do what's needed - stimulate the economy, or get the jobless back to work,"" said senior Republican Representative Kevin Brady. The House finally voted 275-134 in favour of the higher payments. President Trump belatedly signed the coronavirus relief and spending package bill into law late on Sunday. The move averted a partial government shutdown. But even as he put his name on the bill he called for the stimulus cheques to increase to $2,000, saying he wanted ""far less wasteful spending and more money going to the American people"". This video can not be played Trump asked Congress to amend the Covid aid bill earlier this week The $900bn (Â£665bn) relief package is part of a $2.3tn bill that includes $1.4tn for normal federal government funding. Republican and Democratic Party lawmakers had been pleading with him to sign it before a budget deadline of midnight on Monday. If he had not, about 14 million Americans faced a lapse in unemployment benefit payments and new stimulus cheques. The House vote to override Mr Trump's veto of the defence bill saw even more Republicans break with the president to see it pass by 322 to 87. Why the Civil War casts a great shadow over the US Has Trump kept his promises on the military? Republican Representative Mac Thornberry said he would ""only ask that as members vote, they put the best interests of the country first"". Mr Trump blocked the legislation despite it gaining strong bipartisan support. He complained it would limit troop withdrawals from Afghanistan and Europe and lead to the removal of Confederate leaders' names from US military bases. He called the 4,500-page act, which had been nearly a year in the making, a ""gift to China and Russia"". The Senate will vote on Tuesday and again a majority of two thirds will be required to reverse Mr Trump's decision. If Congress does not override Mr Trump's veto in this case, it would be the first time in 60 years that the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) does not become law.

"Members of the armed forces are to give remote support to secondary schools and colleges in England setting up mass Covid testing as the new term begins. Military personnel will hold webinars and give phone support to school staff. But head teachers say they need support on the ground and more time to make the plan workable. They are calling for a delay to the start of term. The government wants pupils to go back in the first two weeks of January, but is keeping the situation under review. What is happening with schools in January? Impact of new variant on children investigated Will schools be closed next term by variant of virus? How does mass testing work? Under the current plans, the majority of secondary school pupils in England are due to start term on 4 January studying remotely, to give head teachers time to implement a round of coronavirus testing for students and staff. Primary school students will return as normal during the same week and will not be tested for Covid-19. Those in exam years and vulnerable pupils will return in person first, with the rest expected to go back on 11 January. But this entails 5.5 million secondary pupils being tested in schools in the space of a week. Several media reports suggest ministers are considering delaying the start of term, with potentially only exam year pupils starting remotely in the first week of January. In response to the reports, a spokesman for the Department for Education said: ""We want all pupils to return in January as school is the best place for their development and mental health. ""But as the prime minister has said, it is right that we follow the path of the pandemic and keep our approach under constant review."" It added that funds had been made available for schools to hire staff from employment agencies to carry out the testing programme. Geoff Barton, general secretary of head teachers' union, the Association of School and College Leaders, said it seemed a ""sensible and prudent approach"" to delay the return to school, given the rising rates of Covid and the new strain of the virus. He added: ""What is vital is that schools are given clear guidance as soon as possible so they can make the necessary arrangements."" Senior Conservative MP, Sir Roger Gale, called for a decision to be made ""now"" on when pupils would return to school. He told BBC Radio 4's PM programme: ""When the situation changes, policy has to change decision. The decision to send primary and secondary school children back to school early in the new year was taken before the spread of the new breed of virus. ""We now know it's pernicious and we know that it affects young people as well as older people. It does seem to me, if we are going to get on top of the spread of the disease we have to do something about young people going back to school."" The Ministry of Defence said 1,500 personnel will form local response teams, providing support and phone advice to institutions on setting up and running Covid testing facilities. Support would be offered ""predominantly through webinars and individual meetings"", it said, but teams would also be on standby to provide in-person support at short notice. England:Secondary school pupils in exam years will return at the start of term while others begin their learning online. Face-to-face learning is expected to resume for everyone by 11 January. Primary schools will return as normal Scotland:Schools will start term on 11 January with learning taking place online until at least 18 January. Wales:Term will start with online learning, but the majority of pupils are expected to resume face-to-face lessons by 11 January. A full return to the classroom is expected to be complete by 18 January Northern Ireland:All schools will initially reopen for face-to-face teaching at the start of term, but years 8 to 10 will move to remote learning from 25 January for at least two weeks Schools in all the UK nations are remaining open for vulnerable children. England, Wales and Scotland have also committed to maintain face-to-face teaching for children of key workers. Mr Barton said schools had been hoping for ""boots on the ground"" in schools and colleges to help run testing centres. ""Instead, it appears that there will be 1,500 personnel available for more than 3,400 secondary schools in England, and that the support will be mainly in the form of webinars and meetings,"" he said. ""This is not remotely sufficient to support schools in the huge task they are being asked to undertake by the government."" There is also pressure from other teaching unions for schools to move to online learning for all pupils except those deemed vulnerable or children of key workers. A meeting was held between ministers, Downing Street officials and the Department for Education on Monday to discuss the plan further, but the department would not comment on its outcome. Some teaching union leaders are also understood to have met DfE officials on Tuesday afternoon. Early research by the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine suggestsschools and universities might need to close on top of existing tier four restrictionsto bring the new fast-spreading coronavirus variant under control. The military has previously helped organise mass testing in Liverpool The military has previously helped organise mass testing in Liverpool and more recently in Kent to clear the backlog of lorries caused by France shutting its UK border. Students will swab themselves in the vast majority of cases, under the supervision of school staff or a volunteer who has been trained for the role, and teachers are not expected to take a role in the testing process. The idea in schools is that following one round of testing all pupils, school staff would be offered a test every week. Then anyone who is a close contact of someone testing positive would be offered tests every day for seven days. This would cut the amount of school pupils miss due to self isolation, and help keep the virus out of schools. SCHOOLS:What will happen if children catch coronavirus?

"NHS England's chief executive said the NHS had ""brilliantly"" looked after 200,000 severely ill Covid-19 patients Health workers are ""back in the eye of the storm"" as coronavirus cases continue to rise, NHS England's chief executive Simon Stevens has said. It has been the ""toughest year"" for the NHS, which has treated 200,000 severely ill Covid-19 patients, he added. Hospitals in England are currently treating more Covid patients than at the peak of the first wave in April. A government scientific adviser has warned national restrictions are needed to prevent a ""catastrophe"". On Monday, a record 41,385 new Covid cases werereported in the UK,external, though it is thought the infection rate was higher during spring when testing was much more limited. NHS England said 20,426 people were being treated for the virus in hospitals in England on Monday, which ishigher than the previous peak of about 19,000 in April. Health officials in Wales and Scotland have also said they are at risk of becoming overwhelmed. Concern at 'unprecedented' English infection level Covid hospital pressures 'incredibly challenging' NHS faces being 'overwhelmed' warn health leaders The spread of the new coronavirus variant means the UK is ""entering a very dangerous new phase of the pandemic"", according to Prof Andrew Hayward, a member of the government's New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group (Nervtag). He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""We're going to need decisive, early, national action to prevent a catastrophe in January and February."" The ""50% increase in transmissibility"" of the new variant means that ""the previous levels of restrictions that worked before won't work now, and so tier four restrictions are likely to be necessary - or even higher than that"", he added. Tier four - England's toughest level of coronavirus restrictions, currently in place in parts of east and south-east England - includes a ""stay at home"" order and non-essential shops having to close. Prof Hayward said: ""I think we're really looking at a situation where we're moving into near lockdown."" He added that he thought schools would have to return ""maybe a little bit later"" but that having schools open would mean ""we're going to have to have increased, strict restrictions in other areas of society to pay for that"". Two stats underline the extent of the pressure on the NHS. One is the more than 20,000 Covid patients in English hospitals, more than the peak in the first wave in April. In many ways it is even tougher for hospitals now, as they are trying to clear the backlog on non-urgent operations and procedures cancelled in the first wave - as well as cope with the surge in Covid numbers. It is worth pointing out, though, that one reason for the high level of patients is that some are there thanks to drugs and therapies discovered in the past year who might not have survived in the first wave. The other key statistic is the 41,385 new daily reported cases - by far the highest number since the testing system was fully established in the summer. Some sadly will become seriously ill after a week or so - which points to even greater strain on hospitals in the new year. In a new year message to staff recorded at a vaccination centre, Sir Simon, the NHS England chief executive, said Covid-19 meant 2020 had probably been ""the toughest year most of us can remember"" - and certainly in the health service. ""Many of us have lost family, friends, colleagues and - at a time of year when we would normally be celebrating - a lot of people are understandably feeling anxious, frustrated and tired. ""And now again we are back in the eye of the storm with a second wave of coronavirus sweeping Europe and, indeed, this country."" This video can not be played ""Now is the right time... to record our enormous debt of gratitude,"" says NHS England boss Sir Simon Stevens He said the pandemic had shown ""sometimes the worst of circumstances bring out the best in people"", which he said was ""certainly true across the health service"". He also said that by late spring he expected the NHS to have offered vaccinations to all vulnerable people, which offered ""the biggest chink of hope"" for 2021. Hospitals in Wales, Scotland and the south of England have reported rising pressure on their services as the number of Covid patients increases. Prof Steve Hams, a chief nurse at Gloucestershire Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, said the situation was becoming ""increasingly challenging"" and staff were becoming ""increasingly exhausted"". He told BBC Breakfast: ""We felt during April that there would be an end to this but actually we're now seeing a third peak so trying to keep our colleagues and our teams going through this time is just incredibly difficult."" Dr Sonia Adesara, an A&E doctor in London, told the same programme that her hospital had seen ""a massive rise"" in people with Covid arriving in the past week, describing it as ""an extremely serious situation"". She said: ""The situation is untenable and I think we are very close to becoming overwhelmed."" However, she added that compared to April, medical staff were getting much better and more experienced at treating the virus.

"Like those lorries stuck in Kent, the new variant of coronavirus is putting plans for reopening schools next term in a holding position. There's a cloud of uncertainty hanging over whether schools in England will really begin to return from 4 January - and whether the plan will stay in place for a staggered start with some secondary pupils returning on 11 January. Asked for a guarantee on whether schools would go back as planned, the Prime Minister Boris Johnson said ""the commonsensical thing to do is to follow the path of the epidemic"". The government would ""keep things under constant review"", he said. It sounded more like let's wait and see, rather than full steam ahead. Boris Johnson said opening schools would be ""under constant review"" The official line from the Department for Education is that the existing plans and new year timetables are still in place - and that it remains a priority to keep schools open. But a statement on Tuesday comes with the rider, or maybe a get-out clause, that ""the path of the pandemic is changing"". This new variant virus and the pre-Christmas clampdown seems to have knocked the wind out of the sails of many of us. And for those planning the return of schools in less than two weeks' time it's added even more pressure. Head teachers' leader Geoff Barton said that in such a ""fast moving and developing situation"" the government must not ""rigidly stick to its plan come what may"". If the new variant spreads more easily among young people, should they be kept out of its path? And does that mean delaying the start of school next term? At present the plan is for primary schools and secondary school exam years to go back on 4 January - and the rest of secondary pupils to return on 11 January. Impact of new variant on children being investigated Huge expansion in school Covid testing from January School staff 'broken' by late Covid test plan But the risk of the new mutant variant could see that timetable overtaken by events - and ministers will be expected to be as fleet-footed as this accelerating strain of the virus. If the tightening restrictions mean it's no longer safe for a family to travel to meet together at Christmas, is it tenable to send children and teachers to gather in large numbers inside school? And if the virus does move rapidly through this age group, would schools end up being closed by default, with so many pupils having to be sent home? The biggest teachers' union, the National Education Union, has called for the first two weeks of term to go online, allowing all pupils to be tested before returning to the classroom. And there have been reports of even longer delays to the new term being considered. Every action has a reaction - and keeping pupils off school would also have consequences, apart from the political pitfall for the government of being accused of a U-turn. Working parents will worry about finding childcare, particularly at short notice, and might not be too delighted at the prospect of home schooling again. Staggered return for schools next term in England Ofsted warns of pupils slipping back after missing school There will be questions about falling behind in learning and concerns about children's well-being - with Ofsted having flagged up a legacy of problems from the first lockdown. This wasn't only slipping back in academic terms, but inspectors have warned of young childrenlosing ""basic skills"" such as using a knife and fork. Many families do not have the computer kit at home for online study, and the ""digital divide"" would get even wider. If any more teaching time is lost, there will be arguments over how exams can go ahead in the summer in a way that's fair. Mass Covid testing in schools - of the type used for university students - has been planned for the start of term The January return to school was also going to mark the start of mass Covid testing for secondary schools - a key part of the plan to end the cycle of schools having to send home so many pupils every time they had a Covid case. That testing plan had become highly contentious, with school leaders furious about a lack of notice and warnings that it could not be set up in time. But any decision on postponing the start of term would also have a knock-on effect for the start of testing. If there are some win-win decisions in politics, this is closer to the lose-lose end of the spectrum. Time is ticking away - and with the Christmas holidays there are only five working days before schools are meant to return. Will the evidence on the new variant virus really be available in time to make an informed decision on reopening? And in the absence of certainty, what will ministers' New Year's resolution be for schools?

"People in parts of Dumfries and Galloway are being urged to stay at home as much as possible after a Covid outbreak more than doubled in two days. The new B.1.1.7 variant has been identified as being part of the outbreak in Wigtownshire, which grew from 64 cases on Boxing Day to 142. It has also been identified in lower Annandale. Health officials have asked people in these regions to ""go beyond"" the level four restrictions where possible. They have asked people to stay at home as much as possible to limit the spread locally and to other parts of the region. And they have warned that it could have an impact on wider local health services. New Covid strain driving 'rapid increase' in cases New strain Covid cases 'very concerning' Of the 154 tests carried out in Stranraer on Sunday, 55 were positive - the biggest increase in Covid cases seen in one area of Dumfries and Galloway since the start of the pandemic. Health officials said they expected to see more cases appearing and extra testing was being put in place in Stranraer from 29 December to 4 January. They are also concerned about a ""growing number"" of cases in lower Annandale, where the new variant has also been identified. Interim Director of Public Health Valerie White said: ""This is a rapidly evolving situation where we expect to see more cases appearing.  At the current rate of spread, there is a very serious concern about how this will impact on services. ""In the days to come, a percentage of people among these newly diagnosed Covid cases will grow ill and the number of people needing hospitalisation is likely to increase - potentially impacting on our ability to provide help to those people who need it for any number of other non-Covid reasons - whether that's heart attacks, strokes, car accidents, etc. ""It's therefore vital that everyone follows the level four directions and the FACTS guidance about use of face coverings, hand hygiene and physical distancing and social interaction."" She added: ""Covid does not just impact on those who develop the coronavirus, or who experience the worst of its symptoms - at this rate of increase, the effect of its rapid spread could be felt by anyone across the entire community."" She urged people to ""be conscious of the threat posed at new year, and consider the potential consequences both personally and community-wide"". The B.1.1.7 variant of Covid-19is up to 70% more transmissible and is viewed as being responsible for significant volumes of cases in south east England. The variant has 17 mutations, where the virus has changed, with some of these changes making it more infectious in lower doses. Along with the rest of mainland Scotland, Dumfries and Galloway has been moved to level four restrictions to try and curb the spread of infection.

"Mr Ramaphosa said the country had let its guard down President Cyril Ramaphosa has announced new tougher coronavirus restrictions, a day after South Africa recorded more than one million Covid-19 cases. Indoor and outdoor gatherings will be banned, a curfew introduced from 21:00 to 06:00, and alcohol sales prohibited. Mr Ramaphosa said the country was at an extremely dangerous point in the pandemic and action had to be taken. Recently authorities confirmed a new, faster-spreading variant of the virus had been detected in South Africa. Some hospitals and medical centres have reported a huge rise in admissions, putting a heavy strain on resources. In a televised speech, Mr Ramaphosa said the new 501.V2 variant was now well established in South Africa, and the recent rise in cases was a ""cause for great alarm"". ""We have simply let our guard down,"" said the president. He added that the new measures would come into effect at midnight on Monday (22:00 GMT) and last at least until 15 January. Coronavirus variants: The science explained UK has two cases of variant linked to South Africa Fresh air: The forgotten coronavirus weapon He said gatherings excepts for funerals and a few other limited exceptions would be banned, no-one would be able to leave their homes between 21:00 and 6:00 without a permit, and all shops, bars and other venues would have to close by 20:00. All alcohol sales would also be banned, and every individual who failed to wear a mask in public places would face possible fines or imprisonment, he added. South Africa is seeing a steady increase in cases driven by the new coronavirus variant On Sunday South Africa became the first country in Africa to pass a million Covid-19 cases, with 1,004,413 infections and 26,735 deaths since the outbreak began in March. Last week, it recorded a daily average of 11,700 new infections - a rise of 39% on the previous week - and from Wednesday to Friday, the daily number of new cases was above 14,000. The 501.V2 variant is believed to be driving the surge in infections. It was identified by a network of South African scientists in the Eastern Cape province and then rapidly spread to other parts of the country. Earlier this week,the UK banned travel from South Africabecause of the new variant.Another new Covid variant has already been detected in the UK, although they have evolved separately. Both have a mutation - called N501Y - which is in a crucial part of the virus that it uses to infect the body's cells, but appear unrelated to each other. After South Africa, the worst hit country on the African continent is Morocco, which has seen 432,079 cases and 7,240 deaths. They are followed by Egypt with 132,541 cases and 7,405 deaths and Tunisia with 131,592 infections and 4,466 deaths.

"There was stunning cosmic imagery to feast on in 2020, from Hubble's 30th birthday image to footage of a daring sample grab on an asteroid. Here's our pick of the year's offerings. The Hubble telescope, one of the most important scientific tools ever built, celebrated its 30th anniversary in April. To mark the occasion, an amazing image was releasedshowing a star-forming region close to our Milky Way galaxy. In this magnificent Hubble portrait, the giant red nebula (NGC 2014) and its smaller blue neighbour (NGC 2020) reside in the Large Magellanic Cloud, a satellite galaxy of the Milky Way located 163,000 light years away. Nebulas are vast interstellar clouds of dust and gas where star formation can take place. At the heart of NGC 2014 is a clutch of bright stars, which are each 10 to 20 times more massive than our Sun. The image was nicknamed the ""cosmic reef"", because astronomers thought the nebulas resembled an undersea world. A BBC Horizon documentary, broadcast to coincide with the anniversary, showcased stunning 3D visualisations of iconic Hubble images - such as the Pillars of Creation, part of the Eagle Nebula. See also:Hubble telescope's Universe revealed in 3D This video can not be played The Pillars of Creation Revealed in 3D This year, Nasa's Osiris-Rex performeda daring ""touch-and-go"" manoeuvre with the asteroid Bennu, in order to collect samples of rock and soil for delivery to Earth. Asteroids like Bennu are primitive relics from the dawn of the Solar System. They are the free-roaming building blocks of planets, and offer a window into how worlds like the Earth came into being. This video can not be played Sampling an asteroid: This image sequence is speeded up and repeated In order to collect samples, Osiris-Rex used a long boom with a ring-shaped collection chamber on the end. The spacecraft descended towards Bennu's surface, delivering a squirt of nitrogen when the boom made contact with the asteroid. This was so that the gas would stir up Bennu's surface, allowing fragments of the asteroid to float into the collection chamber. The strategy seems to have worked, as seen in the sequence of images above. Meanwhile, on 5 December, a Japanese mission to collect samples from a different asteroid returned to Earth with its precious cache. The Hayabusa-2 spacecraft released its sample return capsule, whichparachuted down safely in the Australian desert. The samples will be analysed at a curation facility in Sagamihara City, Japan. This video can not be played Scientists can study features as small as 30km (18 miles) across in this speeded-up movie January saw the release of pictures taken by the Daniel K Inouye Solar Telescope (DKIST) on Hawaii thatshowed the Sun's surface in unprecedented detail. The images show cell-like structures that are roughly the size of the US state of Texas. They are masses of hot, excited gas, or plasma. The bright areas denote where this material is rising; the dark lanes in-between are where cooler plasma is sinking. DKIST is a brand new facility on HaleakalÄ, a 3,000m-high volcano on the Hawaiian island of Maui. Scientists want to use it to uncover fresh insights into the dynamic behaviour of our parent star, in the hope that they can better forecast its energetic outbursts. These colossal eruptions of charged particles can damage Earth-orbiting satellites, harm astronauts, and even to knock out electrical grids. Allow YouTube content?

Launched in 2011, Nasa's Juno spacecraft continues to send back stunning images from the Solar System's biggest planet - Jupiter. The probe captured imagery of the gas giant's swirling cloud decks as it performed its 27th close flyby of the world on 2 June. Citizen scientist Kevin M Gill then transformed the data into a video, which combines 41 still images taken during Juno's close pass. The stills were digitally projected onto a sphere, with a virtual ""camera"" providing views of Jupiter from different angles. Among other things, the footage provides amazing views of Jupiter's most noticeable feature, the giant red spot - which is actually a gigantic ongoing storm. Sun, sea and steel: The Starship prototypes launch from a test site in South Texas Looking a little like a rocket ship from the golden age of science fiction, Elon Musk's Starship vehicle will - in due course, he hopes - transport humans to the Red Planet. In December,SpaceX tested the first complete prototype of the vehicle, sending it on a 12.5km flight straight up from its pad at the company's Boca Chica facility in South Texas. The Starship Raptor engines are unusual in burning methane as their fuel We're cheating a little with its inclusion here, since the images aren't from space, as such. But we might see it there one day, in the not-too-distant future. The test flight showcased some of the spacecraft's unique features, including its methane-burning Raptor engines and a flight trajectory which includes a belly-facing descent to Earth followed by a flip back to the vertical just before landing. RUD. But the test flight will provide SpaceX with invaluable data It was at this stage of the test that the Starship prototype, named SN8, approached the pad a little too fast and hard, causing what Musk describes as a RUD - rapid unscheduled disassembly. A crash, in other words. But the flight will have given SpaceX vast amounts of engineering data to chew on, helping them improve the vehicle. And the next prototype - SN9 - is waiting for its turn on the launch pad.

"People under the age of 40 are to be offered an alternative to the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine in the UK as a precaution, after a review of all the latest evidence by vaccine advisers and safety experts. The UK's medicine regulator - the MHRA - says the benefits of the vaccine still outweigh the risks for the vast majority of people. Under 40s to be offered alternative to AZ vaccine The Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) - the body which advises the government - has now recommended that ""adults aged 18- 39 years with no underlying health conditions are offered an alternative to the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine, if available, and if it does not cause delays in having the vaccine"". Data from the MHRA suggests there's a very small - but slightly higher than normal - incidence of a rare type of clot in younger adult age groups, particularly when the risk of being infected with coronavirus is very low, as it is now. The risk of a clot is roughly one in 100,000 for people in their 40s, and rises to one in 60,000 for people in their 30s. Based on the current data, the following is advised: Anyone who experiences clotting after a first dose of the vaccine should not receive a second dose People with a history of blood disorders (at risk of clotting) should only have the AstraZeneca when the benefits outweigh the risks Pregnant women should talk to their GPs about the benefits and risks The MHRA looked into UK cases of rare blood clots in people who had recently received the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine. It found 242 cases of clotting cases and 49 deaths after an estimated 28.5 million AstraZeneca vaccines doses were administered across the UK up to 28 April. The MHRA said about four people in a million would normally be expected to develop this particular kind of blood clot - though the fact they are so rare makes the usual rate hard to estimate. And the regulator said it had not been proven that the jab had caused the clots. Its head, Dr June Raine, said while the link was ""firming up"", more evidence would be needed. The benefits of the AstraZeneca vaccine outweigh the risks of the virus - hospitalisation and death - for the vast majority of people, she said. But for younger age groups it was more ""finely balanced"". 'Encouraging' antibody boost after both Covid jabs The MHRA study looked at people who had developed clots associated with a low level of platelets after receiving the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine. Platelets are tiny blood cells that help your body form clots to stop bleeding. Among these clots is a type called a Cerebral Venous Sinus Thrombosis (CSVT). CVST occurs when a blood clot forms in large veins in the head - stopping blood from draining out of the brain. As a result, blood cells may break and leak into brain tissue - ultimately leading to a stroke. The clot can occur naturally and are more common, but still very rare, in younger women. The MHRA says anyone who has these symptoms four or more days after receiving the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine should seek prompt medical advice: A severe or persistent headache Blurred vision Chest pain Shortness of breath Swollen legs Persistent abdominal pain Unusual skin bruising Pinpoint spots (not including the injection site) Covid infection itself can make clots more likely, stresses the MHRA. The European Medicines Agency (EMA) has said clottingshould be listed as a very rare vaccine side effect. After a study looking at 86 such cases in the EU, the EMA concluded the benefits of the vaccine outweighed the risk and that there was no definite causal link. Nevertheless,Denmarkhas stopped its AstraZeneca rollout completely - andGermany,Spain, Italy andIrelandhave suspended use of the vaccine in people under 60. France is recommending it only be given to those aged 55 or over, whileAustraliasays people aged under 50 should get the Pfizer jab instead. It is made from a weakened version of a common cold virus (known as an adenovirus) from chimpanzees. It has been modified to contain genetic material shared by the coronavirus - although it can't cause the illness. Once injected, it teaches the body's immune system how to fight the real virus. How do we know Covid vaccines are safe? How do the Covid vaccines compare? Experts are studying all of the current coronavirus vaccines to check how well they work against new, mutated variants of the virus. The government's deputy chief medical officer, Jonathan Van Tam, says there is ""plenty of evidence"" the vaccines appear to beeffective against the Kent variantwhich is dominant in the UK. There is less evidence about protection against other variants, such as those identified in Brazil and South Africa. However astudy of around 2,000 peoplesuggests, while the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine may offer more limited protection against mild and moderate disease caused by the South Africa variant. it should still protect against severe disease.

Here are 10 initial questions and answers: One of the most difficult issues in the negotiations: how many fish will EU boats be able to catch in UK waters in future, and how long will any transition period last before new measures come into full force? Officials involved in the negotiations say the UK initially wanted an 80% cut in the value of the fish caught by EU boats in UK waters, while the EU initially proposed an 18% cut. Who has given more ground? Answer:The value of the fish caught by the EU in UK waters will be cut by 25% - which is a lot less than the UK initially asked for. The cut will be phased in over a transition period lasting five-and-a-half years - which is a lot shorter than the EU initially asked for. Once the transition period is over, the UK will fully control access to its waters, and could make much deeper cuts. If it decides to exclude EU fishing boats they can be compensated for their losses, either through tariffs on UK fishing products (or other goods) exported to the EU, or by preventing UK boats from fishing in EU waters. Fishing was one of the most difficult areas of the negotiations What will the rules on fair competition look like, to ensure that businesses on one side don't gain an unfair advantage over their competitors on the other? The definition of what constitutes reasonable levels of state aid, or government subsidies for business, will be important. Answer:There are level playing field measures which commit both the UK and the EU to maintain common standards on workers' rights, as well as many social and environmental regulations. This was a key EU demand. They don't have to be identical in the future, so the UK does not have to follow EU law, but they do have to be seen to protect fair competition. The UK has also agreed to stick to common principles on how state aid regimes work, and to an independent competition agency which will assess them. But it can choose to develop a system which only makes decisions once evidence of unfair competition is presented. That is different from the EU system which assesses the likely impact of subsidies before they are handed out. This will be the subject of years of negotiations to come. How will the deal actually be enforced if either side breaks any of the terms and conditions? If the UK chooses to move away more radically from EU rules in the future, how quickly can the EU respond? Will it have the ability to impose tariffs (or taxes on UK exports) in one area (for example on cars) in response to a breach of the agreement in another (fish, for example)? Answer:If either side moves away from common standards that exist on 31 December 2020, and if that has a negative impact on the other side, a dispute mechanism can be triggered which could mean tariffs (taxes on goods) being imposed. It is based around a ""rebalancing"" clause which gives both the EU and the UK the right to take steps if there are significant divergences. This clause is much stricter than measures found in other recent EU trade deals, and was a key demand on the European side. It is a mechanism we may hear a lot more about in the coming years. The overall policing of the trade agreement also means that tariffs can be targeted at a specific sector as a result of a dispute in another. There will be a binding arbitration system involving officials from both sides. It means that even though this is a tariff-free agreement, the threat that tariffs can be introduced as a result of future disputes will be a constant factor in UK-EU relations. The EU's highest court will remain the ultimate arbiter of European law. But the UK government has said the direct jurisdiction of the ECJ in Britain will come to an end. So, will the European court play any role in overseeing the future relationship agreement? Answer:The EU has dropped its demand that the ECJ should play a direct role in policing the governance of the agreement in future. That was a clear British red line. One place where the ECJ will still play a role is Northern Ireland, which has a special status under the terms of the Brexit withdrawal agreement. It will remain subject to EU single market and customs union rules, which means the European Court will remain the highest legal authority for some disputes in one part of the UK. What will the rules be for British people who want to travel to the EU from 1 January 2021? We already know some of the details but will there be any additional agreements on things like social security or vehicle insurance? And will there be any detail on any arrangement to replace the European Health Insurance Card (EHIC)? Answer:UK nationals will need a visa if they want to stay in the EU more than 90 days in a 180-day period. They will still be able to use theirEHICs which will remain valid until they expire.The UK government says they will be replaced by a new UK Global Health Insurance Card (GHIC), but there are no further details yet on how to obtain it. Its advice,externalis to take out travel insurance with healthcare cover before going on holiday - especially if you have a pre-existing medical condition. EU pet passports willno longer be valid,but people will still be able to travel with pets, following a different and a more complicated process. The two sides agreed to co-operate on international mobile roaming, but there is nothing in the agreement that would stop UK travellersbeing charged for using their phone in the EUand vice versa. The government also says British citizenswill not need an International Driver's Permit to drive in the EU(unless they still have a paper licence or a licence from the Isle of Man, Guernsey, Jersey or Gibraltar). But they will need to carry a green card to prove they have the right vehicle insurance. The trade agreement is primarily about the rules for goods crossing borders. It will say far less about the trade in services. Is there going to be a separate statement from the EU which will recognise UK rules governing financial services as roughly ""equivalent"" to EU rules? That would make it much easier for UK firms which export services to continue doing business in the EU market. Answer:There is, as expected, not a lot in this agreement for service companies to cheer about. The UK will still be hoping that the EU issues ""equivalence"" decisions on financial services in the near future, but service companies in general have not got as much help in this deal as the British government had been pushing for. The European Commission says a series of ""further clarifications"" will be needed from the UK, including more information on how it will diverge from EU rules after 31 December, before any decisions on equivalence can be made. There is an agreement to continue talking about financial services regulation in the future, but some companies may have to apply to specific EU countries to be allowed to operate there. The guaranteed access that UK companies had to the EU single market is over. This is a really important issue. What will the data protection rules be for UK companies which deal with data from the EU? Again, the UK is hoping the EU will issue separately what's known as a data adequacy decision recognising UK rules as equivalent to its own. But the detail will need to be scrutinised carefully. Answer:Both sides say they want data to flow across borders as smoothly as possible, but the agreement also stresses that individuals have a right to the protection of personal data and privacy and that ""high standards in this regard contribute to trust in the digital economy and to the development of trade"". That's why an EU decision to recognise formally that UK data rules are roughly the same as its own is so important - and we're still waiting for that. In the meantime the EU has agreed to a ""specified period"" of four months, extendable by a further two months, in which data can be exchanged in the same way it is now, as long as the UK makes no changes to its rules on data protection. We know there will be more bureaucracy and delays at borders in the future, for companies trading between the UK and the EU. But will the two sides agree any measures to make things a little easier? There's something called ""mutual recognition of conformity assessment"" which would mean checks on products standards would not need to be nearly as intrusive as they otherwise might be. Answer:There's no agreement on conformity assessment, even though the UK government had hoped there would be. It's just one reminder of how many new barriers to trade there are going to be. In future, if you want to sell your product in both the UK and the EU, you may have to get it checked twice to get it certified. On other border issues, there is also no agreement on recognising each other's sanitary and safety standards for exporting food of animal origin, which means there will have to be pretty intrusive and costly checks for products going into the EU single market. There will however be some measures which cut technical barriers to trade, and the mutual recognition of trusted trader schemes which will make it easier for large companies to operate across borders. A lot of people, from accountants to chefs, work in different EU countries and didn't have to worry about crossing borders multiple times while the UK was part of the EU. But will UK professional qualifications be recognised across the EU in the future, and what restrictions will there be? Answer:The short answer is no - they won't be recognised automatically. That will make it harder for UK citizens supplying any kind of service to work in the EU. They will often have to apply to individual countries to try to get their qualifications accepted, with no guarantee of success. There is a framework in the deal for the UK and EU to agree on mutually recognising individual qualifications but that's weaker than what professionals have now. It's not just about trade. The UK will lose automatic and immediate access to a variety of EU databases which the police use every day - covering things such as criminal records, fingerprints and wanted persons. So what kind of access will they have, and how will security co-operation work in the future? Europol's ""most wanted"" advent calendar, 2016 Answer:The UK loses access to some very key databases but will have continued access to others, including the system which cross-checks fingerprints across the continent. But overall, security co-operation will no longer be based on ""real time"" access. And in some cases, such as access to data on which flights people take, that data will only be made available under much stricter conditions. An agreement has been reached on extradition, and the UK's role in Europol, the cross-border security agency, allows it to sit in on meetings but not have a direct say in decisions. Both of these are positive, and on a par with the best other countries have achieved. Disagreements over data will be dealt with by a new committee, not by the European Court of Justice - again, a red line for the UK. But taken together, the speed with which the UK gets important data, and the influence it has on decisions, has been reduced. There are many other questions to answer - this agreement will form the basis for UK-EU relations for years if not decades to come. And the two sides will have to continue to talk about how to implement it most effectively. The team will continue to read through the text of the agreement and will add more to this story if necessary. What claims do you want BBC Reality Check to investigate?

"The UK-EU trade agreement, which contains new rules for living, working and trading together, takes effect from 23:00 GMT on 31 December. The full complicated agreement ismore than 1,200 pages long,,externalbut here are some of the key points. What the deal says There will be no taxes on goods (tariffs) or limits on the amount that can be traded (quotas) between the UK and the EU from 1 January Some new checks will be introduced at borders, such as safety checks and customs declarations. There are some newrestrictions on certain UK animal food products,external. For example, uncooked meats like sausages and burgers can't enter the EU unless they are frozen to -18C. What does that mean? Having a deal in place means that the fear that some goods could become more expensive has been avoided. However, businesses will still need to prepare for new procedures at ports, and if new paperwork is incomplete,it could lead to disruption. What the deal says: Businesses offering services, such as banking, architecture and accounting, will lose their automatic right of access to EU markets and will face some restrictions. There will no longer be automatic recognition of professional qualifications for people such as doctors, chefs and architects. What does that mean? Rather than following one set of rules for the whole of the EU, UK businesses will need to comply with the regulations in each individual country. It will be harder for people with qualifications gained in the UK to sell their services in the EU. Individuals will need to check each country's rules to make sure their qualification is still recognised. However, the UK and EU have pledged to keep talking to try to improve access for the service sector in the future. What the deal says: UK nationals will need a visa for stays of longer than90 days in the EU in a 180-day period. EUpet passportswill no longer be valid. European Health Insurance Cards, (EHIC) cardswill remain valid until they expire. The UK is no longer subject to the ban on additional roaming charges, although both sides will encourage operators to have""transparent and reasonable rates"" for roaming. What does that mean? The UK government says EHIC will be replaced with a newUK Global Health Insurance Card,external, but full details have not been released yet. Pets will still be allowed in the EU, but it will be a more complicated process as owners will need to obtain an animal health certificate for each trip they make. UK mobile operators will be able to charge for roaming, so people should check with their mobile phone company before travelling. What the deal says: Over the next five-and-a-half years,the UK will gradually gain a greater share of the fish from its own waters. The UK could choose to ban EU fishing boats from 2026, but the EU would be allowed to introduce taxes on British fish in response. What does that mean? Fishing was the hardest and last issue to be resolved in the negotiation, and some UK fishermen are unhappy with the arrangement. The Scottish Fishermen's Federation, for example, says the deal does not give the UK enough control of its waters. Starting in 2026, the UK and the EU will hold regular talks on fishing access. So there could be more heated arguments ahead. What the deal says: There will be no role in the UK for the European Court of Justice (ECJ), which is the highest court in the EU. Disputes that cannot be resolved between the UK and the EU will be referred to an independent tribunal instead. What does that mean? Ending the role of the ECJ was a key UK demand as Brexit supporters said it would allow the UK to ""take back control"" of its laws. The ECJ could still have a role in Northern Ireland because it continues to follow some EU trade rules. If either side moves too far away from the current rules around product standards, tariffs (charges on imports) could be imposed on some goods in the future. What the deal says: The UK will no longer have automatic access to key security databases, but should be able to gain access upon request. The UK will not be a member of the EU's law enforcement agency, Europol, but it will have a presence at its headquarters. The UK is no longer obliged to comply with EU standards of data protection, but data will continue to be exchanged in the same way for at least four months as long as the UK doesn't change its data protection rules. What does that mean? The UK's arrangement with Europol will be similar to the one the US currently has. Many of the rules about storing and processing data still need be decided. What the deal says: The UK will no longer participatein the Erasmus exchange programme, an EU scheme that helps students study in other countries. Students at universities in Northern Ireland will continue to participate in Erasmus, as part of an arrangement with the Irish government. What does that mean? Students that have already started courses in the EU will continue to receive support for fees. A new scheme named after the mathematician Alan Turing,externalwill begin in September 2021. The government says it will be similar to Erasmus but will include countries across the world.

"Virgin Media O2 has announced it will not start charging Virgin Mobile or O2 customers extra for using their phones in Europe. Three, EE and Vodafone are all reintroducing roaming fees for customers travelling to the EU. Between 2017 and the end of 2020, UK consumers were able, within reason, to use the minutes, texts and data included on their mobile phone tariffs when travelling in the EU. But since January 2021, UK operators have been allowed to reintroduce so-called roaming charges because the UK left the EU and theBrexit trade dealdid not rule them out. None of the networks will be charging for roaming in the Republic of Ireland. From 23 May 2022, Three customers who have signed up or upgraded from October 2021 will have to pay Â£2 a day to use the minutes and data from their UK contracts in EU countries. It is also introducing a Â£5 a day charge for roaming in some countries outside the EU, where it previously allowed free roaming. EE will also be charging Â£2 a day in Europe. It will introduce the charges in January 2022 for customers who joined or upgraded their contracts after 7 July 2021. There will be 30-day packages available for people travelling for longer periods. Vodafone has three types of tariff: Its cheapest sim-only deals do not allow any use apart from emergency calls outside the UK and Ireland Some of its more expensive Xtra plans include roaming at no extra charge The rest of its tariffs offer roaming for Â£2 a day. Eight-day and 15-day passes are available for Â£1 a day. EE to reintroduce Europe roaming charges Vodafone to bring back roaming charges from January Three brings in EU roaming charges Virgin Mobile and O2 users will not face EU roaming charges All four of the big operators previously said they had no plans to introduce roaming charges. Whether or not your operator is imposing extra charges, there are ""fair use limits"" on the amount of time that customers will be allowed to use their phones abroad. UK customers have been told that their operators will charge extra if they spend more than half their time overseas, generally measured by being in another country for more than 62 days in a four-month period. That could have happened while the UK was still part of the EU, but some operators have only just started enforcing it. Similarly, data limits are also subject to fair use restrictions. Customers of O2 have a monthly data limit of 25GB and will be charged Â£3.50 for each GB after that. Vodafone's limit is also 25GB with a Â£3.13 charge per GB after that. Three has cut its fair use limit from 20GB a month to 12GB and will charge Â£3 per GB above that. The planned Â£2-a-day fees are still relatively small compared with the costs customers had to pay before the EU banned roaming charges. In the past some people returned from European trips to face bills for hundreds or even thousands of pounds. The UK's trade deal,externalwith the EU said that both sides would encourage operators to have ""transparent and reasonable rates"" for roaming. The UK government also passed legislation to provide some safeguards for consumers: A Â£45-a-month limit on the amount they could be charged for using mobile data abroad before having to opt into further use Requirements for customers to be informed when they have reached 80% and 100% of their data allowance Operators also have to take ""reasonable steps"" to avoid customers being charged for accidental roaming in Northern Ireland, which could happen if a phone there locked on to a mobile signal coming from the Republic of Ireland Without the EU rules in place, the charges levied depend on agreements between UK operators and their counterparts in EU countries. Both sides may have seen this as an opportunity to make some money both from UK customers visiting EU countries and EU customers coming to the UK. The four main operators in the UK declined to comment on the commercial deals they have with other operators. The UK governmentrecommends that customers check the details of their individual tariff,externalwith their phone operator before travelling.

"Rules on travelling between the UK and European Union countries change on 1 January 2021, after an agreement to keep many rules the same for 11 months after Brexit comes to an end. At the moment, no. Because of Covid, travellers from most non-EU countries can't visit except for essential reasons. After 31 December, the UK will no longer be treated like a member of the EU, so becomes subject to these rules. The only non-EU countries exempt from these restrictions are those with very low infection rates, such as New Zealand. The EU could choose to exempt the UK, and individual EU countries could create a ""travel corridor"" with the UK, allowing restriction-free travel. If the rules are changed, you'll be able to travel to all EU countries - plus Switzerland, Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein - as a tourist, without needing a visa. 10 things to look for in the Brexit deal You'll be able to stay for up to 90 days in any 180-day period. So, an Easter weekend in Spain, followed by a June fortnight in Italy, would be covered by your 90-day limit. The rules for Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus and Romania are different. You could make a 90-day trip to any of them and still not use up your 90-day allowance for other EU countries.

No. Your current passport will be valid as long as: It is less than 10 years old And has six months left before it runs out The six-month rule won't apply for visits to Ireland, because it is part ofthe Common Travel Area.,external If you need a new passport -which will be a different colour- the government says youshould apply in plenty of time.,external The European Health Insurance Card (EHIC)has entitled about 27 million UK citizens to state-provided medical treatment if they fall ill or have an accident in EU countries, as well as a number of others. All EHIC cards issued before the end of 2020 will be valid until their expiry date (on the front of your card). The government says it will issue a new card, called the UK Global Health Insurance Card (GHIC). Like EHIC, it will cover chronic or existing illnesses, routine maternity care and emergencies. However, there are no further details yet on when it will start. Its advice,externalis that you should buy travel insurance with healthcare cover before going on holiday - especially if you have a pre-existing medical condition. You'll no longer be able to use EU fast-track passport control and customs lanes. When you arrive in an EU country (except Ireland), be prepared to show your return ticket. You could also be asked to show that you have enough money for your stay.

You should check with your mobile provider to see if you're likely to face extra charges. The four main UK operators have said they have no plans to reintroduce roaming fees. The EU and the UK agreed to co-operate on international mobile roaming. But there is nothing in the post-Brexit trade agreement that would stop travellers being charged for using their phone in the EU, and vice versa, in the future. The government has passed laws to protect customers, including: A Â£45-a-month cap on using mobile data abroad (then you must opt in to use more) Requirements for customers to be informed when they've reached 80% and 100% of their data allowance Yes, but you'll need to take your driving licence, as well as your log book (V5C) and valid insurance documents if you are taking your own car. You will need to contact your insurer six weeks before you travel to get a green card that will prove you have insurance. Most drivers will not need to buy an International Driving Permit, with the exception of those with paper licences (not photocards) and those with licences issued in Gibraltar, Guernsey, Jersey or the Isle of Man, who will need one for some European countries. What are the rules on driving in the EU after transition? Pet passports issued in Great Britain will not be valid for travel to the EU from 1 January 2021. From that date,pets travelling from Great Britain to the EU will need to have an animal health certificate (AHC).,externalThe same rules will apply if you are taking your pet to Northern Ireland. In 2002, this dog was the first to travel to the UK using a pet passport AHCs will be issued by a vet, will be valid for four months and must be obtained no more than 10 days before travel. AHCs will be valid for a single trip into the EU, onward travel within the EU and re-entry to Great Britain. Your pet must have been microchipped and have had a rabies vaccination. It will also have to have a treatment againstEchinococcus multilocularis(a type of tapeworm) for entry into Finland, Republic of Ireland, Northern Ireland, Norway or Malta.

"Martin Lambie-Nairn in 2011 Martin Lambie-Nairn, the noted designer who created popular ""idents"" for the BBC and Channel 4, has died aged 75. His design consultancy created Channel 4's original animated ""blocks"" logo in 1982 and the globe balloon idents used by BBC One from 1997 to 2001. His company also produced memorable idents for BBC Two, one of which had blue paint splashing horizontally across the screen to hit a metallic 2. He was recently seen discussing his work on BBC Four'sThe Sound of TV. Lambie-Nairn's death on Christmas Day was announced by ML-N, the consultancy he co-founded. He was behind Channel 4's original blocks logo In a statement, it described him as ""one of the leading graphic designers and creative directors of his generation"". ""His exceptional work, kindness and infectious creative spirit touched the lives of so many people,"" the statement continued. ""He will be hugely missed by everyone who had the privilege to work alongside him over the years."" Former Apple design chief Sir Jony Ive also paid tribute, saying he was ""fortunate"" Lambie-Nairn had ""defined part of my visual landscape growing up"". ""His work for the BBC was so very gentle, thoughtful and beautiful,"" he said. ""Identities driven by beauty and not a marketing agenda are so rare and so valuable."" He also conceived BBC One's familiar globe balloon Lambie-Nairn's other credits include satirical puppet show Spitting Image, which he co-created with John Lloyd, Roger Law and and Peter Fluck. It was Lambie-Nairn who suggested Fluck and Law make a show based on their sculpted caricatures. This led to episodes of the original show,recently revived by streaming service BritBox, bearing the credit ""From an original lunch by Martin Lambie-Nairn"". Other brand signifiers in which his company had a hand include the bubble logo used by mobile phone company O2. He also oversaw a Blue Peter competitionto design the official emblem for the Queen's diamond jubilee in 2012. His BBC Two idents gave the channel a sleek new identity Speaking to the BBC in 2013, Lambie-Nairn said designers like himself were ""in the business of setting channels apart from each other"". ""All branding is about setting yourself apart and trying to be clear to your audience or customers that you stand for this set of values,"" he continued. Ident is an industry term used to describe a moving logo shown to identify a TV channel between programmes. Follow us onFacebook,external, or on Twitter@BBCNewsEnts,external.
