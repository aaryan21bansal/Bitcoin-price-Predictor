"Bieber had been expected to play another 14 dates in Asia and North America Justin Bieber has apologised to his fans after cancelling the remaining dates of his Purpose World Tour because of ""unforeseen circumstances"". The move affects 14 dates in Asia and North America which were coming up over the next three months. Bieber told celebrity news website TMZ.com: ""I'm sorry for anybody who feels disappointed or betrayed."" The singer has performed more than 150 shows on the tour, promoting his 2015 album Purpose, since March 2016. The tour grossed $93.2m (Â£71.5m) in the first half of 2017, with an average of almost 40,000 ticket sales per date. The singer recently performed in Hyde Park Bieber added: ""I have been on tour for two years. I'm looking forward to just resting, getting some relaxation and we're going to ride some bikes."" The singer's manager,Scooter Braun, posted on Instagram,external: ""To Justin, who gave it his all night after night, thank you. ""And to those that won't be able to see it... on behalf of myself, Justin, and the team, we are sorry. That was never our intent. But a man's soul and wellbeing I truly care about came first and we must all respect and honour that. ""Justin will be back and I know he looks forward to performing for you and with you all again. One chapter ends and another begins."" A statement on Bieber's website,externalread: ""Justin loves his fans and hates to disappoint them. ""He is grateful and honoured to have shared that experience with his cast and crew for over 150 successful shows across six continents during this run. ""However, after careful consideration he has decided he will not be performing any further dates. Tickets will be refunded at point of purchase."" How Justin Bieber hypnotised Hyde Park Five things we learned from Justin Bieber's tour demands Most of Bieber's remaining dates were in the US, but he was also due to play in Japan, Hong Kong, the Philippines, Singapore and Indonesia. Chinese officialssaid last weekthat the Canadian pop star had been banned from mainland China because he had engaged in what they described as ""bad behaviour"". Bieber's decision comes a few weeks after British singer Adelecancelledthe last two shows of her world tour on medical advice after damaging her vocal cords.

"The Greenland ice sheet covers an area about seven times the size of the UK Scientists are ""very worried"" that the melting of the Greenland ice sheet could accelerate and raise sea levels more than expected. They say warmer conditions are encouraging algae to grow and darken the surface. Dark ice absorbs more solar radiation than clean white ice so warms up and melts more rapidly. Currently the Greenland ice sheet is adding up to 1mm a year to the rise in the global average level of the oceans. It is the largest mass of ice in the northern hemisphere covering an area about seven times the size of the United Kingdom and reaching up to 3km (2 miles) in thickness. This means that the average sea level would rise around the world by about seven metres, more than 20ft, if it all melted. That is why Greenland, though remote, is a focus of research which has direct relevance to major coastal cities as far apart as Miami, London and Shanghai and low-lying areas in Bangladesh and parts of Britain. Algae were first observed on the Greenland ice sheet more than a century ago but until recently its potential impact was ignored. Only in the last few years have researchers started to explore how the microscopically small plants could affect future melting. A five-year UK research project known as Black and Bloom is under way to investigate the different species of algae and how they might spread, and then to use this knowledge to improve computer projections of future sea level rise. The possibility of biologically inspired melting was not included in the estimates for sea level rise published by the UN's climate panel, the IPCC, in its latest report in 2013. This video can not be played ""Like stepping onto the Moon"": Life on the ice That study said the worst-case scenario was a rise of 98cm by the end of the century. One concern now is that rising temperatures will allow algae to flourish not only on the slopes of the narrow margins of the ice-sheet but also on the flat areas in the far larger interior where melting could happen on a much bigger scale. We joined the latest phase of research in which scientists set up camp on the ice-sheet to gather accurate measurements of the ""albedo"" or the amount of solar radiation reflected by the surface. White snow reflects up to 90% of solar radiation while dark patches of algae will only reflect about 35% or even as little as 1% in the blackest spots. When we flew by helicopter onto the ice sheet, the rolling landscape seemed surprisingly grey - my first impression was that it looked dirty. Scientists are investigating the different species of algae and how they might spread Much of the surface was covered with what looked like patches of soot and it was pockmarked with countless holes at the bottom of which were pitch-black layers of a mix of algae, bacteria and minerals known as cryoconite. Prof Martyn Tranter of Bristol University, who is leading the project, told me: ""People are very worried about the possibility that the ice sheet might be melting faster and faster in the future. ""We suspect that in a warming climate these dark algae will grow over larger and larger parts of the Greenland ice sheet and it might well be that they will cause more melting and an acceleration of sea level rise. ""Our project is trying to understand just how much melting might occur."" Over the last 20 years, Greenland has been losing more ice than it gains through snowfall in winter - a change in a natural balance that normally keeps the ice-sheet stable. This video can not be played David Shukman explains how scientists live on an ice sheet - and how you go to toilet Biological darkening has not been built into scientists' climate projections And one of the project scientists, Dr Andrew Tedstone, a glaciologist and also of Bristol University, said that over much of the same period, images from the MODIS satellite showed a darkening trend with the years of greatest dark producing most meltwater. He said: ""We still don't think we've reached a point where we've seen the maximum darkness that we're going to see in this area so the fieldwork we're doing is to try to find out in a warming climate 'do we think the area is going to get any darker than we've already seen in the last 15 years?'"" Earlier research had found that the ice sheet is covered with a range of contaminants carried on the winds including dust and soot from as far away as Canadian prairie fires and the industrial heartlands of China, America and Europe. But studies over the past five years have shown that the majority of the dark material may be biological with different kinds of algae turning the ice black, brown, green and even mauve. ""This is a living landscape,"" according to Dr Joe Cook, a glacial microbiologist at Sheffield University. ""This is an extremely difficult place for anything to live but, as we look around us, all this darkness we can see on the ice surface is living - algae, microbes, living and reproducing in the ice sheet and changing its colour."" Ice retreat does not have to be total to have a damaging impact ""We know they're very widespread and we know that they're very dark and we know that that's accelerating melt but that's not something that's built into any of our climate projections - and that's something that needs to change."" The final phase of the Black and Bloom project involves weaving the new factor of biological darkening into climate models to come up with revised estimates for future sea level rise. And, as Dr Cook explained, the retreat of the Greenland ice sheet does not need to be total to have a widespread and damaging impact. ""When we say the ice sheet is melting faster, no one saying it's all going to melt in next decade or the next 100 years or even the next 1,000 years but it doesn't all have to melt for more people to be in danger - only a small amount has to melt to threaten millions in coastal communities around world."" Meanwhile, another factor that may be driving the melting has been identified by an Austrian member of the team, Stefan Hofer, a PhD student at Bristol. In a paper recentlypublished in Science Advances,external, he analysed satellite imagery and found that over the past 20 years there has been a 15% decrease in cloud cover over Greenland in the summer months. ""It was definitely a 'wow' moment,"" he told me. Although temperature is an obvious driver of melting, the paper estimated that two-thirds of additional melting, above the long-term average, was attributable to clearer skies. What is not known is how this might affect the algae. Their darker pigments are believed to be a protection from ultra violet light - so more sunshine might encourage that process of darkening or prove to be damaging to them. The Black and Bloom project, funded by the Natural Environment Research Council (Nerc), aims to publish its new projections for sea level rise in two years' time.

"The sculpture will be part of a Â£630,000 investment project at Flint Castle. Plans to create an iron ring sculpture at Flint Castle have been described as ""insulting to Wales"". The design, said to represent the relationship between the medieval monarchies of Europe and the castles they built,was unveiled on Friday. But critics including Plaid Cymru's North Wales AM Llyr Gruffydd said it symbolises the oppression of Welsh people. Monuments body Cadw said the plans were ""about investing in Flint"". Flint was one of the first castles to be built in Wales by Edward I - construction began in 1277. The winning design was selected by a panel following a nation-wide competition, and the architects said it demonstrated ""the unstable nature of the crown"". But Mr Gruffydd said a sculpture celebrating the conquest of Wales by Edward I was ""inappropriate and insulting"". ""The 'ring of steel' is the description given to the chain of castles across Wales that were built to conquer and subjugate Wales,"" he said. ""From a Welsh perspective, this is certainly not something to celebrate. It does not either reflect the many rich Welsh legends that could have been the source of a far more appropriate sculpture."" Apetition,externalhas also been launched calling the design ""extremely disrespectful"". By Monday it had attracted more than 2,000 signatures. People have also criticised the sculpture on social media. TJ Bucktweeted,external: ""I think even a 'balloon made of lead' would have gone down better than this idea"", while Carolyn Hittposted,external: ""Flint has rich history of female factory workers. Turn those into legends rather than remember Edward I's Iron Ring."" But Andrew Barrattâsaid,external: ""It symbolises the role of castles, we were subjugated, it's history, sad but let's get over it living in the past won't forge our new Wales."" In response, a spokeswoman for Cadw said it recognises ""that art divides opinions, encourages debate, and can be interpreted in many ways"". ""These plans are about investing in Flint, increasing visitor numbers and growing the local economy. The proposed sculpture would also provide a unique opportunity to promote Welsh steel, as well as tell powerful stories that continue to shape our lives today,"" the spokeswoman said. ""We will continue to listen to a range of views on this important project as it evolves, and ensure that decisions over issues such as the words inscribed on the sculpture reflect local opinions and the complex and often difficult history of Wales."" A spokeswoman for Arts Council of Wales said its role was to ""assist with advice in setting up the tender process and selecting the work"" alongside other panellists from Visit Wales and Cadw.

"This video can not be played Chris Gard: ""We are so sorry we could not save you"" The parents of terminally ill baby Charlie Gard have ended their legal challenge to take him to the US for experimental treatment. A lawyer representing Chris Gard and Connie Yates told the High Court ""time had run out"" for the baby. Mr Gard said it meant his ""sweet, gorgeous, innocent little boy"" will not reach his first birthday on 4 August. ""To let our beautiful little Charlie go"" is ""the hardest thing we'll ever have to do"", his mother said. Charlie's parents said they made the decision because a US doctor had told them it was now too late to give Charlie nucleoside therapy. Charlie Gard's medical case explained,external Charlie has a rare genetic condition and would not live to see his first birthday, his father said ""We only wanted to give him a chance of life,"" Ms Yates told the court in a statement. ""A whole lot of time has been wasted,"" she added. ""We are sorry we could not save you."" Their lawyer Grant Armstrong said the parents' worst fears had been confirmed. He told judge Mr Justice Francis US neurologist Dr Michio Hirano had said he was no longer willing to offer the baby experimental therapy after he saw the results of a new MRI scan last week. He added Mr Gard and Ms Yates, from Bedfont, west London, now hoped toestablish a foundationto ensure Charlie's voice ""continues to be heard"". Several supporters of Charlie's parents' campaign gathered outside the court In a statement outside court, Mr Gard said Charlie was an ""absolute warrior"" and they ""could not be prouder of him."" ""Charlie has had a greater impact on and touched more people in this world in his 11 months than many people do in a lifetime. ""We could not have more love and pride for our beautiful boy. ""We are now going to spend our last precious moments with our son Charlie, who unfortunately won't make his first birthday in just under two weeks' time."" They had raised Â£1.3m in donations to take their son abroad for treatment. Charlie has encephalomyopathic mitochondrial DNA depletion syndrome. He has brain damage and cannot move his arms or legs. Some supporters shouted after hearing the news from inside the court Katie Gollop, the lawyer representing Great Ormond Street Hospital (GOSH) where Charlie has been treated since October, said doctors disagreed with the parents who believed MRI scans in January had shown ""treatment could have been effective at that time"". ""All aspects of the clinical picture and all of Charlie's observations indicated that his brain was irreversibly damaged and that [the therapy] was futile,"" she said. The hospital paid tribute to the ""bravery"" of the decision made by Charlie's parents. In a statement, it said: ""Over the weekend, they communicated their desire to spend all the time they can with Charlie whilst working with the hospital to formulate the best possible plan for his end of life care. ""The agony, desolation and bravery of their decision command GOSH's utmost respect and humble all who work there."" Mr Justice Francis paid tribute to Charlie's parents and said no-one could comprehend their agony and no parents could have done more. In hisjudgement,external, the judge said last week's MRI scans had shown ""Charlie has no muscle at all"" on parts of his body and was ""beyond help"". He said Mr Gard and Ms Yates were now prepared to accept Charlie should be moved to palliative care and be allowed to die with dignity. The judge also decried the ""absurd notion which has appeared in recent days that Charlie has been a prisoner of the National Health Service"", calling it ""the antithesis of the truth"". ""In this country children have rights independent of their parents,"" he said. Occasionally there were circumstances when a hospital and the parents were unable to agree what course of action was in the best interest of the child patient, in that instance the decision is referred to an independent judge, he continued. Charlie has been in intensive care at GOSH since October Outside court, Charlie's Army campaigners reacted angrily and chanted, ""shame on you judge"" and ""shame on GOSH"". Falling to the ground, one female supporter said: ""He had a chance and you took it away.""

"This video can not be played Why you should make credit card payments in the local currency when abroad British holidaymakers are paying hundreds of millions of pounds in unnecessary charges when they use their credit and debit cards overseas. Shops, restaurants and cash machines are offering tourists the option of paying in pounds rather than the local currency and applying a poor exchange rate if they take up the offer. This costs UK tourists about Â£500m a year, analysis for the BBC has found. The lower rates are equivalent to charging about 6% on each transaction. But currency trader FairFX found that on some transactions tourists can lose up to 10% by paying in sterling rather than the domestic currency. The practice of offering a pay-in-sterling option is called dynamic currency conversion. Most tourists are on their guard against being stung by high prices. What they don't expect is that they could be trapped by the payment system itself. One of the biggest danger areas at the moment is the Netherlands, so much so that the Dutch consumer organisation, the Consumentenbond, is urging visitors to take extra care. ""Let me warn those that are being offered to pay by card and the shop owner says: 'Would you like me to give you the exchange rate of what it will be in pounds' - don't do it"", says Sandra de Jong, who speaks for the group. A high proportion of shops and bars in Amsterdam, the ones popular with tourists, offer dynamic currency conversion. Dynamic currency conversion is sold as an extra convenience. But in practice, many British tourists are utterly non-plussed by the choice they are being offered. ""To be honest I find it very confusing,"" Jim Begg from Belfast told me as he was setting out on a bike tour round the city, ""I never know which is the right one to choose, though I know one gives a much better rate."" Ollie, a student from Bristol, told me he was caught out when using a card for hotel bills. ""Initially I chose to pay in pounds because I thought that paying in home currency might be better for some reason, but we ended up paying quite a significant amount more."" At a cheesemonger, once my card went into the payment machine, up popped a choice: a price in euros and a price in pounds. What happens is that if you buy in euros the transaction goes through a standard route, with the exchange rate set by Mastercard or Visa, although your bank can impose an additional charge. But if you choose to pay in pounds, your money is changed on the spot by the shop's bank or payment processor. And they decide on the rate. With the cheese I was buying, that meant a loss of 3.5% compared with the Mastercard rate. Then, in a bar for lunch, I was offered an exchange rate which hacked a 5% slice out of my money. And at a cash machine in a shop, the hit if I chose to pay in pounds for a cash withdrawal was nearly 10%. Less than 1.02 euros for each of my pounds, rather than the 1.13 euros available that day via Mastercard. The lesson is a clear one: it's almost always better to pay in the local currency. The BBC asked the currency card and foreign exchange provider FairFX to estimate how much people were being charged for dynamic currency conversion, by analysing its customers' overseas spending. It says that based on the average fee of 6%, UK travellers are being charged just under Â£500m a year. Overall, one-in-five foreign transactions are affected, but in some countries and with some transactions the proportions are much higher. At least half of the UK spend on cards in the Netherlands and Hungary is subject to the charges, and more than half of cash withdrawals in Sweden. Thailand, Malta, Spain, Cyprus and Turkey all come high in the list of countries where people should be careful. Dynamic currency conversion is legal in the UK and across Europe, as long as traders display not just the price but also the exchange rate being used before the payment is made. But often the rate isn't shown in the form British tourists are used to and, in any case, most people find it hard to assess a rate on the spot. ""The way it is pushed is abhorrent,"" says James Hickman from FairFX, ""The amount they charge should be capped."" Who benefits? The gains are usually split between the trader and the trader's bank or payment processor. That means dynamic currency conversion can be sold to shops and other businesses as a way of recouping their banking costs and even make a profit on top.

""I have criticised the appalling misogyny and homophobia of Islam, I have criticised the murdering of apostates for no crime other than their disbelief,"" Professor Dawkins writes. He also pointed out that he has been a ""frequent critic of Christianity but have never been de-platformed for that"". He describes listening to KPFA ""almost every day"" during the two years he lived in Berkeley, adding that ""I especially admired your habit of always quoting sources"".

"The Orange Order is the largest Protestant organisation in Northern Ireland The Orange Order has asked its members to stop using the term 'RIP' to express grief or sympathy after a death. It said the phrase is unbiblical, un-Protestant, and a form of superstition connected to Catholicism. RIP is an abbreviation of 'rest in peace' or in Latin, 'requiescat in pace'. In a publication marking the 500th anniversary of the Reformation, the order called on Protestants to stop using the phrase. Profile: The Orange Order,external Wallace Thompson, secretary of Evangelical Protestants Northern Ireland, wrote a Facebook post on which the article was based. He told the BBC's Talkback programme: ""Observing social media, we have noticed that the letters RIP are used a lot by Protestants, and by some evangelical Protestants."" Mr Thompson explained that for him, 'RIP' is a prayer and he did not encourage prayers for the dead. ""From a Protestant point of view, we believe, when death comes, a person either goes to be with Christ for all eternity, or into hell. Wallace Thompson believes that the phrase 'RIP' is effectively a prayer for the dead and therefore un-Protestant ""That's what we believe the gospel to be and in this 500th anniversary year of the Reformation, I think Luther, when the scales fell off his eyes, realised that it was all by faith alone, in Christ alone, the decision is made during life, on this earth, so that when death comes it has been made and no decision has been made after death,"" he said. Speaking on the same programme, former Presbyterian moderator Dr Ken Newell said he did not use the phrase very often. ""I think when people use [RIP] in social media, there's a remembrance and a good wish in it, almost a blessing,"" he said. He disagreed that people are praying for the dead when they used the phrase. ""If folk in the Orange Order want to take this line that's perfectly up to them, they are making a good point. ""I think ordinary people have not worked out the issues. This comes out of the human heart,"" he added. In response to a request for a spokesperson of the issue, the Orange Order referred the BBC to comments made by the county grand master of County Fermanagh Grand Orange Lodge, Stuart Brooker, in the Impartial Reporter newspaper. In it he said: ""I think the message in the article is very clear and well put together, and I couldn't add anything further to it. ""This article clearly explains why we as Protestants, and members of the Orange Institution, shouldn't use the term 'RIP'. ""It also reminds us that if we need guidance in any matter, we should refer to what the bible teaches."" The Orange Order is the largest Protestant organisation in Northern Ireland. It regards itself as defending civil and religious liberties of Protestants and seeks to uphold the rule and ascendancy of a Protestant monarch in the United Kingdom.

"Corrie Mckeague was last seen in Bury St Edmunds on 24 September A skull found amid the large-scale search for Corrie Mckeague was not that of the missing airman, police said. It was found at a landfill site in Landbeach, Cambridgeshire at a time when police were trawling another landfill at nearby Milton for the missing 23-year-old. Police said the skull was female and dated back to pre-1945. Mr Mckeague's family was informed of the find. Mr Mckeague, of Dunfermline, was last seen in Bury St Edmunds in September. LIVE: Updates on this story and other news from the county The tortuous search for Corrie Mckeague A spokeswoman for Cambridgeshire Police said: ""On April 14 a human skull was discovered at a landfill site in Ely Road, Landbeach, near Cambridge. ""Early indications of the age of the skull meant it was highly unlikely to be that of Corrie Mckeague, however Suffolk Police and Corrie's family were informed. ""It has since been established that the skull is female and dates back to before 1945. ""There are no suspicious circumstances therefore the investigation has been closed."" The spokeswoman said the skull was found by workers at the site and had been traced back to a house clearance of a man who ""collected curios"". The coroner was made aware of the discovery, she said. Thousands of tonnes of waste have been searched and sifted at the landfill site in Milton On Friday, Suffolk Police confirmed it hadended its search of waste at the Milton landfill site. Police also said on Friday an external force was reviewing the investigation. On Monday, Suffolk Police said that until this review was completed the area of the landfill site searched would be left in ""its current state"" and would not be used for further waste disposal. Corrie's mother Nicola Urquhart has urged the force to reconsider and is consideringseeking an injunction to stop the site being backfilled.

"The Department for Transport says London will have to fund half the upfront costs of Crossrail 2 and the government had not yet committed to public funding Government support for a new London rail line after scrapping projects in Wales and the north of England has been described as ""frankly outrageous"". Greater Manchester mayor Andy Burnham said there would be ""widespread anger"" at the decision to back the railway line, which will run through London. Liverpool City Region's mayor said there needed to be ""balanced spending"". The government said it was spending billions on infrastructure elsewhere. On Friday it was announced that the rail link between Manchester and Newcastle may not be fully electrified, despite promises from the previous government. Greater Manchester mayor Andy Burnham said: ""We can't wait forever, we need improvements now, that's why the electrification is important, and it's also why we need more capacity at Manchester Piccadilly. ""People travelling [to Manchester] across the northern cities who will have a long commute home, I think, will be furious... that the government has cut back on rail investment in the north on the day that it's green light to Crossrail 2. ""They're not governing for the whole country."" The Liverpool-Newcastle link was to be fully electrified, according to the previous government Crossrail 2, a north-east to south-west railway, which would tunnel beneath central London, could be running by 2033. It is estimated the scheme will cost about Â£30bn at 2014 prices and construction could start in the early 2020s. It would link Hertfordshire and Surrey, passing through Tottenham Hale, Euston-St Pancras, Tottenham Court Road, Victoria and Clapham Junction. Announcing the decision toback Crossrail 2,external, the Department for Transport (DfT) said Transport Secretary Chris Grayling and Mayor of London Sadiq Khan had agreed there was ""no doubt London needs new infrastructure to support its growth and ensure it continues as the UK's economic powerhouse"". Mr Grayling said: ""I am a supporter of Crossrail 2, but given its price tag we have to ensure that we get this right. ""The mayor and I have agreed to work together on it over the coming months to develop plans that are as strong as possible, so that the public gets an affordable scheme that is fair to the UK taxpayer."" Last week, the government was criticised for scrapping the planned electrification of railway lines in parts of England and Wales. At the time, Mr Grayling said the government would instead introduce faster trains with more seats and better on-board facilities. On Monday Mr Burnhamtweeted,external: ""On Friday, Tories say they can't afford rail schemes in the North. ""On Monday, they find billions more for London. Are these 2 things linked?"" He said: ""People here have had to put up with sub-standard rail services for decades and will simply not accept that spending billions more on London is the country's highest priority for transport investment."". He added that the fact the announcement had been made after Parliament had broken up for the summer was ""denying any real scrutiny"" of the decision. Liverpool City Region Mayor Steve Rotheram said that while he did not ""begrudge"" the investment in London and the South East, there needed to be balanced spending to ""support growth in the North as well"". London Mayor Sadiq Khan said: ""Crossrail 2 is essential for the future prosperity of London and the South East, so I'm pleased that the transport secretary and I have reached an agreement to take this vital project forward."" A DfT spokesman said that while it had agreed to work further with Transport for London on Crossrail 2, it said London needed to pay half of the upfront construction costs and that the government had not committed any public funding yet. The spokesman added that the government was spending Â£57bn on HS2, Â£1bn to improve rail infrastructure in the north of England and Â£800m on new road schemes.

"This video can not be played Kushner: 'Stop ridiculing Trump voters' Donald Trump's son-in-law has defended his conduct in last year's presidential campaign, after giving evidence to a Senate panel investigating Russian interference in the election. Jared Kushner said all of his ""actions were proper and occurred in the normal course of events"" of the campaign. Mr Kushner, 36, has also denied any collusion with Russia. He is a senior adviser to the president and was in charge of the campaign's digital strategy. He is married to Mr Trump's daughter, Ivanka. Speaking at the White House after a closed-door session of the Senate Intelligence Committee, Mr Kushner said he had been ""fully transparent in providing all the requested information"". ""Let me be very clear - I did not collude with Russia, nor do I know of anyone else in the campaign who did so. I had no improper contacts,"" he said. Mr Kushner, who keeps a very low media profile, will appear before the equivalent House of Representatives committee on Tuesday. Jared Kushner's full 11-page statement,external Russia: The 'cloud' over the Trump White House How Trump's Russia trouble unfolded In a statement,externalto both congressional committees released before the Senate session on Monday, he said there were ""hardly any"" contacts with Russian representatives, adding later that there were ""perhaps four"". This video can not be played The BBC's Sarah Rainsford tries to get Russian pop star Emin Agalarov to comment on his links to Donald Trump. He refers to a meeting with Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya in June last year. She had allegedly promised damaging material on Hillary Clinton. Mr Kushner said he arrived late at the meeting, realised little of note was being discussed and that it was ""time not well-spent"". Where Trump is seen as saviour Is Kushner the most powerful 36-year-old in the world? Jared Kushner: The son-in-law with Donald Trump's ear Mr Trump Jr said former campaign chief Paul Manafort was also at the meeting and that no compromising material on Mrs Clinton was provided. Ambassador Sergei Kislyak(above). Brief meeting of ""pleasantries"" in April 2016 in Washington. Meeting at Trump Tower on 1 December. Discussed Syria and trying to improve relations. Mr Kushner insists he did not suggest a ""secret back channel"" for communication or discuss sanctions. Mr Kislyak's term ended on Saturday Sergei Gorkov. Mr Kushner says he met the banker on 12 December at the request of Mr Kislyak, who presented him as a man with direct links to President Vladimir Putin. Mr Kushner insists he did not discuss sanctions, business interests or specific policy issues and has had no contacts with him since Guccifer400. Mr Kushner says he received a ""random email"" trying to extort 52 bitcoins in exchange for not publishing Mr Trump's tax details. Mr Kushner says he ignored the email Natalia Veselnitskaya. Mr Kushner said he had not spoken to the lawyer before or since the June 2016 meeting and had forgotten about it until an email exchange involving President Trump's son, Donald Jr, came to light last month. He says: ""No part of the meeting I attended included anything about the campaign, there was no follow up to the meeting that I am aware of, I do not recall how many people were there (or their names), and I have no knowledge of any documents being offered or accepted."" In his statement, Mr Kushner accepted that he failed initially to reveal his contacts with Russians. He says the first form, a ""rough draft that still had many omissions"", was filed by an assistant in error on 18 January and that declarations on his foreign contacts, not just with Russians, were added over the next six months ""in the normal course"". Mr Trump Jr and Mr Manafort had been scheduled to appear before Congress on Wednesday to testify but that has been delayed indefinitely as lawyers negotiate on the documentation and information to be discussed. Anthony Zurcher, BBC North America reporter In his Senate testimony Jared Kushner says he has nothing to hide and is ""happy"" to share information with those investigating possible Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential campaign. His written statement, however, is an exercise in caution and lawyerly discretion. He addresses only the controversies already in the public sphere, then offers his explanation for why they are no big deal. He receives hundreds of emails a day and didn't read his brother-in-law's forwarded message that said the Russian government wanted to help the Trump campaign. Reports of an effort to set up back-channel communications with Russia after the election were a halted effort to get information about Syria from Russian generals. He met with an influential Russian banker because the Russian ambassador - whose name he couldn't initially remember - was so persistent. The incomplete security form was the result of a ""miscommunication"" with an assistant who submitted it too soon. Beyond that, there are no new revelations; no new disclosures. If what's already out is all there is, Mr Kushner and his lawyers have done their best to defuse the bombs. When walking in a minefield, it's the ones you don't know about that pose the greatest risk. President Trump has repeatedly denied any collusion with Russia. He continued his tirade against the investigation process on Sunday, tweeting: ""As the phony Russian Witch Hunt continues, two groups are laughing at this excuse for a lost election taking hold, Democrats and Russians!""

"Supermarket recalls newborn nappies range to investigate 'burns' Asda has withdrawn an own-brand type of newborn nappy after a family complained their baby had suffered a ""chemical reaction"" to the product. Jordan Bartliff, from South Yorkshire, put images showing his premature son's red and blistered skin on Facebook. The father is warning other parents he fears there is a ""bad batch"" of the Little Angels newborn nappies. Asda said ""our hearts go out to the Bartliff family"", adding it had withdrawn the product for tests. Facebook post from the father of the three-week old baby In his first post Mr Bartliff said his child, who he does not name, had been wearing Little Angels newborn nappies for three-weeks ""with no problems whatsoever"" and that ""he's not allergic to them"". But he said that following what appeared to be a ""chemical reaction"" his son, born five weeks premature, had needed hospital treatment on Saturday morning and was moved on to a ventilator after experiencing breathing difficulties. ""I wouldn't want it happening to any other little soul, so please be vigilant and careful with these nappies as it obviously is a bad batch,"" he added. And in a later post he said Asda had ""recalled"" the nappies and that his son was in the process of being transferred to another hospital in Sheffield. Facebook update about three-week old baby posted on Monday evening Asda said the supermarket chain had started investigating and had made a ""nationwide call to remove the product on Monday afternoon"". Lizzy Massey, the chain's vice president of own brand, said: ""Our hearts go out to the Bartliff family and hope their baby son makes a full recovery soon. ""We're in touch with his dad and have collected the nappies so that we can test them along with others in the batch.

"It must be serious. They've deployed the Royals. The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge have been on tour in Germany with a very specific purpose: to reassure the country that Brexit doesn't mean the break-up of a beautiful relationship. Prince William, after speaking a few words in German, told guests at a British embassy garden party: ""This relationship between UK and Germany really matters, it will continue despite Britain's recent decision to leave the European Union. I am confident we will remain the firmest of friends."" But since the British election, German politicians are more troubled than ever about Brexit. The German council for foreign relations' director, Daniela Schwarzer, told me: ""Policymakers in Berlin are surprised and worried at the degree of confusion in London, the lack of clarity as to the strategy the UK wants to follow. ""There is a lot surprise about how the negotiations are being handled and the somewhat incoherent messages which come out of London."" Of course, Germany is just one country in the European Union - but it is first among equals, its chancellor by far the most senior politician, with a new and determined ally in President Macron, who's refreshed the Franco-German alliance. Even before Brexit became a reality, there's been an argument, almost an assumption, that German industry would put pressure on German politicians to argue for a good deal for the UK - access to the European market without having to abide by the rules. The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge recently toured Germany So far, Mrs Merkel has been adamant: no cherry picking. Will German industry push her to change her mind? I visited the Trumpf company in Stuttgart, a concern with a turnover of 3bn euros (Â£2.7bn) a year that makes sheet metal, laser cutters and machine tools. It employs 4,000 people in Germany and another 8,000 globally: in the USA, China, Japan, South Korea - and in Luton, Southampton and Rugby. The company's Heidi Maier tells me orders from the UK are up because people have got used to the idea of Brexit. ""Despite political insecurities and decisions we don't like and we don't back, our business is doing very well,"" she says. We stand in front of the True Punch 5000. The machine is swift and certain, precise and elegant, all the qualities that make Germans so proud of their engineering prowess. The exact opposite of these qualities - slowness and uncertainty - is what worries German industry about Brexit. German Mittelstand wants 'soft Brexit' Brexiteers in warning to German business Brexit: UK offer on EU citizens a good start, says Merkel Brexit: All you need to know about the UK leaving the EU I ask Ms Maier what they want Mrs Merkel to push for. ""What would help is decisions, and fast decisions,"" she says. ""As soon as we know the new rules, we can go ahead. We are actually preparing for tariffs, which is the implication [of what the British government is saying], which would worsen our business. The goods we produce in Great Britain would become more expensive due to the tariffs, and we don't know how our customers would react to that."" Most German businesses tend to lobby government through powerful trade associations. And one industry has more horsepower than any other. Germany's glittering car industry is an industrial giant with immense political clout and a 400bn euro turnover, employing 800,000 people. And the relationship with the UK is very important. One in seven cars exported from Germany goes to the UK, its single biggest market. The Trumpf machine is just one example of German high-tech engineering Ever since Brexit was a speck on the horizon, enthusiasts for leaving have argued the mighty German auto industry wouldn't allow politicians to punish Britain, a point I put to Matthias Wissman, the president of the VDA, the German automotive industry association. ""What we want is to keep the European Union of the 27 together,"" he says. ""That is the first priority. Second priority is to have a trade area with the UK with no tariff barriers, no non-tariff barriers. That is possible if the UK understands what the preconditions are. ""We want a good deal for Britain, but the best deal for Britain would be to stay in the customs union. Anything else would be worse for both sides. The best thing would be to stay in the internal market, like Norway."" He accused pro-Brexiteers of making ""totally unrealistic"" promises. ""I see a lot which is astonishing for a friend of Great Britain. I miss the traditional British pragmatism. We would like to have it in the future, but I see more and more ideological points of view which make pragmatism very difficult and unfortunately in both parties, Conservative and Labour."" The UK is the German auto industry's biggest export market When I put to him Liam Fox's view that a trade deal with the EU could be ""one of the easiest in human history"", he laughs and says it would take years and years but ""time is running out"". ""You need a transition period. And if you want an easy solution, stay in the customs union and the internal market. ""A transition period would also be very pragmatic. We hope that on the British side that gets deeper and deeper into the intellectual capabilities of those who decide."" This is not just the view of one man, or one industry. There seems to be a consensus among the industrial powerbrokers. Klaus Deutsch of the federation of German industry, the BDI, makes it clear they did not want Brexit in the first place and would like the UK to stay in the single market and observe all the rules. But that's not the government's intention, so what follows? ""We would favour a comprehensive agreement. But the most important thing is legal certainty in the period from A to B.  If you don't have a transition period of many years, then there will be a huge disruption to all sorts of businesses. ""The concern of business is unless you get a clear cut and legally safe agreement, you can't sell pharmaceuticals, or cars or what have you, across the Channel, you have to stop business, divest, change business models."" Will Germany prioritise EU unity over its economic relationship with the UK? He makes it clear only the British government can decide what it wants, but what about the idea they'll push Mrs Merkel to soften her approach? ""That's completely unlikely,"" Mr Deutsch says. ""The importance of the European Union for German corporates is even higher than the importance of a bilateral relationship with the United Kingdom. So, the priority of safeguardingâ¦ the unity of the European Union is much more important than one economic relationship. There are a lot of illusions - it won't happen."" Speaking on BBC Radio 4's The World This Weekend programme, Owen Paterson, the former cabinet minister, who recently visited Germany, told me he had felt a ""sense of denial"" in the country over Brexit. ""It is hugely in everyone's interest that we maintain reciprocal free trade and as we have absolute conformity of standards, everyone should get their head round that,"" he told me. ""Whereas [the Germans] are still thinking entirely in terms of remaining in the current institutions and that's clearly what we are not going to do. ""We're not going to stay in the single market. We are not going to stay in the customs union. We're certainly not going to stay under the remit of the European Court of Justice. I found that that was something they had not really got their heads round."" And my overriding impression of the view of the big beasts of Germany industry? Frustration that they don't know where the British government wants to head and a strong sense that any outcome will be worse than what exists. But also, a total rejection of the idea that the economic relationship with the UK outweighs the German interest in European unity. How could customs union deal work?

"It can take more than five years for trans men and women in England and Wales to legally change their gender under the current system. But this process could be made quicker as the result of a new government consultation on streamlining the process. At the moment, in order to change gender in the eyes of the law, individuals have to apply for a certificate under the 2004 Gender Recognition Act. They must be aged 18 or older. First they must live for two years in their preferred gender. This is not to do with medical intervention -  they can apply to change their legal gender without having undergone any hormone therapy or other treatment. Then they would need to have a diagnosis of gender dysphoria from a psychiatrist. This is a condition where a person experiences distress because of a mismatch between their biological sex and gender identity. There are only eight gender identity clinics across England and Wales. Rebecca Stinson, head of trans inclusion for Stonewall, the campaign group for lesbian, gay, bisexual and trans equality, says people can wait years even for a first appointment, depending on where they live. Getting a gender recognition certificate can take more than five years, she adds meaning that the vast majority of trans people do not apply at all because of the cost, waiting time, and ""degrading"" process of having to prove their gender. Only once someone has this diagnosis, can they apply to a gender recognition panel - a legal tribunal. The panel, made up of legal and medical experts, will look at the evidence submitted before deciding whether to issue a certificate. The government wants to overhaul the process so that people seeking to legally change their gender do not need a diagnosis of gender dysphoria or to give evidence that they have been in transition for at least two years. The government says it wants to ""streamline and demedicalise the process"", making it simpler and more administrative. Exactly what the new process will be is the basis of the current consultation. People can change the gender on documentation including passports and driving licences without a gender recognition certificate, but the certificate is the only way to have their gender formally recognised in the eyes of the law. It replaces a birth certificate and has implications for things like pension and for workplace checks, including the Disclosure and Barring Service (DBS) checks necessary to work with children. A gender recognition certificate is also required to ensure that trans men and women are placed in the single sex services appropriate to their gender if needed, like prisons or rape crisis centres. At the moment, the process is reversible. If someone changes their mind, they can apply to have the certificate revoked.

"London's Tate Modern gallery uses solar panels - will the rule changes mean more ordinary households follow suit? Major changes to the way electricity is produced, used and stored are being planned by the government. It hopes we will be able to create power in our own homes, store it and even sell it back to the National Grid. This could mean billions of pounds in savings for UK households, the Business Secretary, Greg Clark, has said. How will it work? And how soon can we all tap into this power revolution? Here are a selection of questions asked by readers of BBC online. The Smart Systems and Flexibility plan is designed to reduce energy bills by making the electricity network more efficient, and allow homes and businesses to manage their electric use more effectively. Currently, the price of electricity varies throughout the day, depending on levels of supply and demand, but most consumers are on flat rate tariffs that do not reflect the times of day when power is cheaper. The government says it aims to: Ensure all household and businesses are offered a smart meter by the end of 2020, which should give consumers greater control, and record when in the day energy is used. Change the way energy suppliers account for the energy they buy. In future, energy suppliers will be able to make smart tariffs more widely available to consumers. For example, there might be more periods of off-peak electricity. Set standards for appliances (such as white goods, or in future electric vehicles) that are able to automatically respond to price signals and use electricity when it is cheapest. The government says the 700,0000 houses that have solar panels will benefit as the new plan opens up the possibility of households storing their power on batteries. Some companies already offer consumers a battery package, which means they can store to excess power and either use it when they get home from work, or export it to the grid. However, those planning to install solar power will not be given new support for installing solar panels now. But the existing Feed-in Tariff remains in place. It may not be possible to calculate this without knowing how much power you would be able to buy and sell. Rates of return are dependent on factors such as light levels, technology used and location. The current support for just domestic solar panels can result in a 6-10% return, but this excludes battery storage devices, which are more expensive. Storage is expected to operate at different scales across the energy system. The government says some might be existing technologies like pumped hydro (pumping large volumes of water up a hill into manmade reservoirs, and releasing it when electricity is needed), or in big batteries housed in warehouses. Household battery use could also increase, possibly using the battery in an electric vehicle or a battery on the wall. At the moment they are expensive, but the price is expected to fall with increased innovation and greater production. The batteries used in homes are usually the same as those that are used in electric vehicles (lithium ion). As more of these are built and bought the costs of batteries is expected to fall rapidly. A recent Renewable Energy Association/KPMG report put the expected cost reduction at 30% over the next three years. Used car batteries are also now being used in homes. Nissan has a partnership with Eaton Energy Storage to install their English-made used electric vehicle batteries in homes, once they are no longer responsive enough to be used on the road, but can still provide effective home storage. The government has been looking at this and says it recently commissioned work on the seriousness of the cyber security risk up to 2030. It says it is using this to assess the cyber security risks contained in a smart energy system. The government also proposes to take on additional powers for smart appliances as part of this programme, although it is not yet clear what these would be.

"This video can not be played When England beat India to win Women's World Cup If you're going to win the Women's World Cup, it might as well be the biggest ever staged. When Heather Knight got her hands on the ultimate prize in women's cricket on an emotional Sunday afternoon at Lord's, it marked a triumph not only for England, but the sport itself. For Knight, kissing the silverware is a world away from four years ago, when she was clinging on to a place in an England side that failed to reach the final. But her personal transformation, and her team under coach Mark Robinson, is nothing compared to that of the women's game from a 2013 World Cup that was barely befitting of the name. Held in India, mainly Mumbai, it hardly registered with the locals in a nation where cricket is loved like no other. This video can not be played Winning the World Cup is a 'watershed' moment - England captain Knight Its very staging came under threat over a row about the presence of the Pakistan team, who were eventually shifted to the other side of the country - 1,000 miles away in Cuttack - and forced to sleep at the Barabati Stadium. The women were due to play at Mumbai's iconic Wankhede Stadium, only to be evicted to make way for men's matches. Facilities at venues were shoddy and publicity non-existent. Although global TV audiences were up, matches were played to near empty stadiums, despite entry being free of charge. ""It was shocking in India,"" former England batter Ebony Rainford-Brent told BBC Sport. ""In a cricket-crazy country, you would expect to see something - posters, adverts - but there was nothing. ""The only people in the grounds were a few family members. It was almost like the cricket wasn't happening."" Now, the World Cup doesn't just seem like a different event, but women's cricket is an entirely different sport. England triumph a 'springboard' for women's cricket Report: Shrubsole stars as England win Women's World Cup Watch the moment England won In Short: 'There's never been a better time to be a woman in cricket' The Guardian was among the newspapers to feature England's victory on Monday's front page The final at Lord's was a fitting conclusion to a tournament that has catapulted women's cricket into the national and international consciousness. What began with a marketing campaign on the London Underground and in cinemas ended in a sold-out Lord's and the most-watched game of women's cricket in history. Across the tournament, all matches were shown live for the first time, with more than 50 million watching the group games alone. Over the course of the event, the International Cricket Council expects an 80% increase in worldwide viewership. More than one million users followed England's final victory on the BBC Sport website, while the hosts' nerve-shredding semi-final victory over South Africa was also front-page news.  In the host cities - Bristol, Leicester, Derby and Taunton - 30,000 people visited fan zones. ""Everything you could think of to promote the tournament has been done,"" added Rainford-Brent. ""The investment and energy that has gone into has been incredible. To finish with a packed Lord's ticked the final box."" This video can not be played The moment England won the Women's World Cup The audience is a new one, too, riding a wave that perhaps began with last year's launch of the Twenty20 Super League, a competition that attracted an average attendance in excess of 1,000, larger than the inaugural season of its football equivalent in 2011. At the World Cup, 50% of ticket-buyers were women, while 31% of those in attendance were under the age of 16. About 13,000 tickets were given away to schools and every child at Lord's on Sunday received a plastic bat as a souvenir of the incredible final. Marie, from Surrey, was at the game with seven-year-old daughter Lucy and said: ""Lucy's dad played cricket but she has become more aware that women play too. ""We've heard a lot about women's cricket on the radio and now she is more aware that there are opportunities for her in the future if she wants to play sport."" Tom, from London, brought daughters Connie, five, and Cissie, three, to their first game of cricket. ""I thought it would be a fun game for them, with lots of entertainment going on around the edges,"" he said. Youngsters may have Knight, Tammy Beaumont and Anya Shrubsole as their new England heroes and be keen to try their hand atNatalie Sciver's Nat-meg,,externalbut India's surprise run to the final could turn out to be far more important for the future of the women's game than England's fourth world title. Four years ago, interest in the tournament on home soil was so low that, when India were dumped out in the first round, journalists (not many of them) could wander up to a lonely Mithali Raj for their own private audience with the captain. Now, even if the impressive Raj is unlikely to reach the demi-god status of Sachin Tendulkar, Virat Kohli and MS Dhoni, her country actually knows who she and her exciting team are. When India's men pulled off a shock triumph in the 1983 World Cup, it began a boom in one-day cricket. When the same teamwon the inaugural World Twenty20,externalin 2007, a nation previously pretty sniffy about the shortest form of the game threw itself into the Indian Premier League. Might India now follow the example of Australia and England to launch its own T20 league for women? Raj, Smriti Mandhana and Harmanpreet Kaur are stars that could take women's cricket to the masses. ""Why not start a league of our own in India?"" said Raj. ""Now is the right time to create that in India because women's cricket is everywhere. ""If more girls participate in leagues like that, they will improve their game and gain valuable experience."" Mark Robinson (back row, third from left) was appointed coach in November 2015 If the women's game is about to face greater commercialisation, exposure and expectation then England are lucky to have Robinson, a man who should take his share of credit for their triumph. When the former fast bowler made the surprise switch from Sussex's men's side, England's results had been patchy for some time. Although they had won two of the previous three Ashes series, they were without a global trophy since 2009. When that record was extended with a semi-final exit at the 2016 World T20, Robinson made his move. Ifhis public attack on the players' fitnessraised eyebrows, then the axing of captain Charlotte Edwards was genuinely stunning - not least to some inside the England and Wales Cricket Board. Edwards was (and still is) a fine player, one of the greatest there has ever been in the women's game, but her maternal, dominant presence could be stifling and suffocating. Too often, England were reliant on the performances of a handful of players, with the rest left to feel like they were making up the numbers. In the past year, Beaumont, Lauren Winfield, Fran Wilson and Alex Hartley have all established themselves at international level. Knight averages more with the bat as captain than she did in the ranks and Sarah Taylor has returned from a break enforced by an anxiety problem. Tears and a house called Alan - inside story of England's band of sisters But it is not just on the field where Robinson has made changes. In a game just getting to grips with professionalism, players previously signed one-year contracts. Recognising that meant they were faced with the threat of unemployment on an annual basis, Robinson successfully pushed for the security of two-year deals. He has also created an environment of honesty, openness and acceptance in a bid to make sure the players do not lose their identities to the rigors of the game. One player was comfortable enough to bring her teddy bear to a team meeting. ""Mark has been brilliant,"" said Knight. ""He has encouraged us to be honest and that has made us as a team. ""He has annoyed us at times with tough love, but he has pushed us, improved us and made us believe. We're very thankful."" Robinson, though, will not be in the limelight in the aftermath of England's triumph, and nor should he be. The adulation goes to Knight and the 14 other players that have triumphed in the biggest tournament, match and spectacle women's cricket has ever seen. They are role models in a game that is taking its place at global sport's top table. Who runs the world? Girls.

"It sounded like cannon fire - pirates, probably. The British East India Company's ship Benares was docked at Makassar, on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi. Its commander gave the order to set sail and hunt them down. Three days later, the crew still hadn't found any pirates. What they had actually heard was the eruption of a volcano called Mount Tambora. A cocktail of toxic gas and liquefied rock roared down the volcano's slopes at the speed of a hurricane, killing thousands. Mount Tambora was left 4,000ft (1,220m) shorter. The year was 1815. Slowly, a vast cloud of volcanic ash drifted across the northern hemisphere, blocking the Sun. In Europe, 1816 became ""the year without a summer"". Crops failed. Desperate people ate rats, cats and grass. In the German town of Darmstadt, the suffering made a deep impression on a 13-year-old boy. Justus von Liebig loved helping out in his father's workshop, concocting pigments, paints and polishes. Liebig grew up to be a brilliant chemist, driven by the desire to help prevent hunger. He did some of the earliest research into fertilisers. He pioneered nutritional science and invented beef extract. He invented something else, too: infant formula. 50 Things That Made the Modern Economyhighlights the inventions, ideas and innovations that helped create the economic world. It is broadcast on the BBC World Service. You can findmore information about the programme's sourcesandlisten onlineorsubscribe to the programme podcast. Launched in 1865, Liebig's Soluble Food for Babies was a powder comprising cow's milk, wheat flour, malt flour and potassium bicarbonate. It was the first commercial substitute for breast milk to come from rigorous scientific study. As Liebig knew, not every baby has a mother who can breastfeed. Justus von Liebig was inspired by the hunger he witnessed while a young man Indeed, not every baby has a mother: before modern medicine, about one in 100 childbirths killed the mother. It's little better in the poorest countries today. Some mothers can't make enough milk - the figures are disputed, but could be as high as one in 20. What happened to those kids before formula? Parents who could afford it employed wet-nurses - a respectable profession for the working girl, and an early casualty of Liebig's invention. Some used a goat or donkey. Many gave their infants ""pap"", a bread-and-water mush, from hard-to-clean receptacles that must have teemed with bacteria. No wonder death rates were high: in the early 1800s, only two in three babies who weren't breastfed lived to see their first birthday. Liebig's formula hit the market at a propitious time. Germ theory was increasingly well understood, and the rubber teat had just been invented. The appeal of formula quickly spread beyond women who couldn't breastfeed. Liebig's Soluble Food for Babies democratised a lifestyle choice that had previously been open only to the well-to-do. It's a choice that now shapes the modern workplace. For many new mothers who want - or need - to get back to work, formula is a godsend. And women are right to worry that taking time out might damage their careers. Recently, economists studied the experiences of the high-powered men and women emerging from Chicago University's MBA programme and entering the worlds of consulting and high finance. At first, the women had similar experiences to the men - but over a time, a huge gap in earnings opened up. The critical moment? Motherhood. Women took time off, and employers paid them less in response. Ironically, the men were more likely than the women to have children. They just didn't change their working patterns. Mark Zuckerberg is one of the few high-profile chief executives to take paternity leave There are biological and cultural reasons why women are more likely than men to take time off when they start families. We can't change the fact that only women have wombs, but we can try to change workplace culture. More governments are following Scandinavia's lead by giving fathers the legal right to take time off.  More leaders -such as Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg- are setting an example by taking it. And formula milk makes it a whole lot easier for Dad to take over while Mum gets back to work. There is, of course, the breast-pump option. But for some, it's more of an effort than formula. Do mums really need breastfeeding help from technology? Studies show that the less time mothers have off work, the less likely they are to persevere with breastfeeding. That's hardly surprising. There's just one problem. Evolution has had thousands of generations to optimise the recipe for breast milk. And formula doesn't quite match it, especially in the developing world, where clean water and sterilised equipment is not always available. A series of articles published by the medical journal the Lancet in 2016,externallists the risks. Formula-fed infants get sick more often than breastfed children, leading to costs for medical treatment, and parents taking time off work. Researchers believe breastfeeding could help prevent more than 800,000 child deaths a year It's thought that nearly half of all diarrhoea episodes and a third of all respiratory infections could be prevented by breastfeeding. That, combined with the risk of using formula in less than ideal circumstances, can even lead to deaths. According to the Lancet's analysis of more than 1,300 studies,external, breastfeeding could prevent about 800,000 child deaths a year. Justus von Liebig wanted to save lives. He would be horrified. Of course, in rich countries, contaminated milk and water are far less of a concern. But formula has another, less obvious economic cost. Again, according to the Lancet, there is evidence that breastfed babies grow up with slightly higher IQs - about three points, when you control as best you can for other factors. What might be the benefit of making a whole generation of children just that little bit more clever? The Lancet calculated it to be about $300bn (Â£232bn) a year,external. That's several times the value of the global formula market. Consequently, many governments try to promote breastfeeding. But nobody makes a quick profit from that. Selling formula, on the other hand, can be lucrative. The tiny pill which gave birth to an economic revolution TV dinners: The hidden cost of the processed food revolution How Ikea's Billy bookcase took over the world Grace Hopper's compiler: Computing's hidden hero Which have you seen more of recently: public service announcements about breastfeeding, or formula ads? Liebig himself never claimed that his Soluble Food for Babies was better than breast milk: he simply said he'd made it as nutritionally similar as possible. But he quickly inspired imitators who weren't so scrupulous. By the 1890s, adverts for formula routinely portrayed it as state-of-the-art. Meanwhile, paediatricians were starting to notice higher rates of scurvy and rickets among the offspring of mothers whom the advertising swayed. The controversy peaked in 1974, when the campaigning groupWar on Want published a pamphlet called The Baby Killer,externalabout how Nestle marked and sold infant formula in Africa.Nestle boycotts lasted years. By 1981, there was a World Health Organization (WHO)International Code of Marketing Breast-milk Substitutes,external, whichNestle says it drew on to devise its own marketing code,external, the first manufacturer to do so. But the WHO code is not hard law, and many campaigners argue that it is still widely flouted. What if there was a way to get the best of all worlds: equal career breaks for mothers and fathers, and breast milk for infants, without the faff of breast pumps? Perhaps there is - if you don't mind taking market forces to their logical conclusion. Breast milk can be frozen and used at a later date In Utah, there's a company called Ambrosia Labs. Its business model? Pay mothers around the world to express breast milk, screen it for quality, and sell it on to American mothers. Milk is pricey - over $100 (Â£77) a litre (1.75 pints). But that could come down with scale - and maybe formula could be taxed, to fund a breast-milk market subsidy. Not everyone likes this idea. Indeed, the government in Cambodia, where Ambrosia used to operate,has banned the export of breast milk. Still, more than 150 years after Justus von Liebig sounded the death knell for wet nursing as a profession, perhaps the global supply chain could find a way to bring it back.

"This video can not be played When it comes to superyachts, the bigger the better Wandering along the beach in Italy's Viareggio you could be forgiven for thinking it's simply a holiday resort. Yet the umbrella-lined, sandy beaches dotted with tourists mask another role, one at the heart of the shipping industry. This unassuming seaside city is where some of the world's largest and most exclusive vessels are made. Its speciality is the superyacht. These giant crewed vessels start at about the length of an average swimming pool - 24-metres. But the biggest can stretch to five or more times this. It's a world that belongs to only the very wealthiest of the wealthy - to buy a superyacht you have to be super rich. Just 370 superyachts were sold last year around the globe, yet collectively these sales were worth a staggering 3.4bn euros (Â£3bn; $4bn). The most expensive superyacht sold so far this year cost 155m euros, according toBoat International,externalwhich collates the industry data. Viareggio is where about a fifth of these gigantic elite boats are made. It's the ""cradle of shipbuilding"" is how the city's mayor Giorgio del Ghingaro sums it up. Tourism isn't the only big industry in Viareggio In fact, the town's involvement in the industry goes back almost 200 years to 1819 when the first dock was built. Viareggio started to build large, strong wooden ships to transport the marble from the region's famous quarries. This laid the foundations for what would eventually become a major international shipping industry with a history of carpentry and craftsmanship. The growing popularity of the superyacht has meant Viareggio has evolved again, shifting from making the wooden boats it was once famous for to constructing these giant metal and fibreglass vessels. Vincenzo Poerio, the chief executive of shipbuilding firm Benetti, which is headquartered in Viareggio, believes the region's artistic roots have helped to drive its success in the industry. Tuscan cities such as Lucca, Pisa, Siena and Florence are renowned for their craftmanship in marble, wood, leather and architecture. And people in the market for buying a superyacht expect everything - the interior as well as the exterior - to look perfect. A superyacht is ""probably the most expensive toy in the world,"" says Benetti boss Vincenzo Poerio Of course you need more than artistic flair to build a superyacht. For such large and expensive projects, engineering skills are crucial as are project management expertise to ensure the boat is built on time and on budget. But Mr Poerio says the most important attribute to be successful in this industry is people skills to enable them to deal with the often ""challenging"" demands of the super rich. Maintaining good relations matter because it's a personal transaction, not a business one, he says: ""At the end of the day, you are building a big toy, probably the most expensive toy in the world."" In contrast to similar industries such as luxury cars or private aircraft, it's much harder to build these vessels in a standardised way. ""In our case most of the time we start from scratch. So the client is not buying a product, he's building a product which makes a huge differenceâ¦ Most of the time it's not easy to manage these requests,"" says Mr Poerio. When it comes to superyachts, the interior is as important as the exterior This approach is now starting to shift, with some shipbuilders including Benetti and Perini Navi, building smaller superyachts without first receiving an order. For their wealthy customers, used to getting things when they want them, an instantly-available boat is a big attraction. But for the firms investing millions when they don't yet know if they'll be able to find a customer it is a risky strategy. Yet Burak Akgul, a managing director at shipbuilder Perini Navi, says he's not worried. ""We are an indulgence. There's always someone who's ready to indulge, it's just a matter of whether or not we manage to get hold of them,"" he jokes. In fact, he says, the brand Perini has become a sort of status symbol, marking a certain level of achievement. ""We started seeing people expressing themselves as having reached the point where they now need to have their Perini. ""They didn't know what they wanted yet, but they had this feeling that they had come to the point of their personal success that time had come for them to build a Perini this was something they had to add to their stable,"" he says. Building a superyacht can take years One other advantage for Viareggio is that it is already well equipped to cope with the vagaries of the superyacht industry, which because it is so small and specialised can see demand fluctuate wildly depending on the wider economy. The skills required to build a superyacht are similar to those for a military boat with both of similar sizes. Massimo Perotti, owner of ship builder San Lorenzo, says this is a useful balance, with demand for pleasure yachts naturally reducing when military vessels are required and vice versa. Nonetheless, the extreme wealth of their clientele means they're also more cushioned from the impact of world events. Even in the financial crisis, San Lorenzo managed to expand, selling about 20 yachts, partly by targeting new markets in Russia, South America, Brazil and India. The crisis did, however, mark a shift in their customer base. Instead of getting people who wanted a superyacht to show how rich and powerful they were he says, most customers are now genuinely interested in boating. Yet even with a flow of wealthy customers ready to indulge, the Italian industry is facing competition from other rivals within Europe and even China. Lower labour costs and raw materials mean these countries are able to produce a cheaper boat. ""If you want a piece of art you go to Italy,"" says San Lorenzo's Massimo Perotti But Benetti's Mr Poerio says that for the ""very, very, very rich people"" they cater for, price isn't what matters. When people are spending millions and millions of euros ""the brand has to mean something,"" he says. He believes things like the customer relationships and service they offer, as well as the guarantee of a certain level of quality, means they should be able to keep customers from going elsewhere. San Lorenzo's Mr Perotti agrees: ""If you buy a superyacht it's for yourself. You like technology, design, luxury; you know, it's not cheap and you are not looking to to have it at the lowest cost."" In the end, it comes back to what Viareggio has always been renowned for -  artistic flair. ""The characteristic of the Italians is individualism and creativity. Maybe you buy a German car because the Germans are better in organisation. But if you want to buy a piece of art you probably go to Italy.""

"Charity donation websites, often used to support victims of violence, are being employed by a number of Westerners to finance their personal war efforts. Fighting continues in eastern Ukraine, as pro-Russian separatists battle Ukrainian government forces. More than 10,000 people have died since the conflict erupted in April 2014, andrecently a rebel leader declared a state called ""Malorossiya"" (Little Russia) in Donetsk. Among the separatists are a number of Westerners, drawn to the country by the conflict and financing their adventures using charity crowdfunding websites - sometimes in apparent violation of website rules and Ukrainian laws. One of the most prominent is Russell Bentley, a Texas native who describes himself as a pro-Russian communist. When the conflict started, Bentley was working as an ordinary lumberjack in Austin. Yet by December 2014 he had reached the epicentre of the conflict - armed with a rocket propelled grenade launcher and tasked with repelling Ukrainian forces at Donetsk airport, a key strategic position. Ukraine conflict: Why is east hit by conflict? Ukraine crisis: What is Novorossiya role? Ukraine conflict: Russia rejects new Donetsk rebel 'state' From the start, Bentley has relied on crowdfunding websites to finance his exploits. Crowdfunding websites such as GoFundMe, JustGiving and Indiegogo are typically used for charitable purposes - including to raise money for the victims of tragedies. People can donate money in exchange for small gifts or 'perks'. For example, the Manchester Evening Newsraised over Â£2.5 million,externalthrough JustGiving for the families of those killed and injured in the recent Manchester terror attack in the UK. However, Bentley and others have been using these crowdfunding websites to fund their own personal war efforts in Ukraine. In November 2014, Bentley launched a GoFundMe page to finance a ""fact finding mission"" to Donbas, the conflict zone that includes the eastern Ukrainian regions of Donetsk and Luhansk. Bentley raised $2,000 and hasn't returned to the United States since. After spending six months fighting with separatists on the front line, Bentley was reassigned and now works, he says, as an ""information warrior"" - producing regular pro-separatist propaganda videos on the Ukrainian war. Bentley is affiliated with the Essence of Time movement - a Russia-based communist group which seeks to create ""USSR 2.0"", involving the break-up of Ukraine. Bentley's videos are hosted on the group's YouTube page, which has 25,000 subscribers. In the videos, Bentley encourages fellow Americans to join him in eastern Ukraine. One of his recommendations is for volunteers to raise money via crowdfunding before they travel. Bentley states in one video: ""Don't show up here brokeâ¦ You can do a crowd fundraiser - a GoFundMe or an Indiegogo. Say you're coming here to help. Say you're coming here to find the truth. Don't say you're coming here to fight."" Russell Bentley has spent nearly three years in Donbass after crowdfunding his initial journey to Ukraine But most crowdfunding websites - includingGoFundMe,externalandIndiegogo,external- strictly prohibit campaigns designed to raise money for violent purposes. Despite the site's rules, Bentley's most recent campaign, hosted on Indiegogo, features a video of him touring the conflict areas with an automatic weapon - at one point firing at a Ukrainian military drone. He talks about his time on the front line, while encouraging armed resistance against ""Ukrainian Nazis"". Bentley's current crowdfunding effort is raising funds to publish a self-authored book about his war experiences in Donbas. The Texan offers military shoulder patches and T-shirts for donations of between $100 and $999. Before BBC Trending contacted Indiegogo about Bentley's campaign, ""secret"" perks were offered for larger donations. These perks could only be revealed by emailing Bentley directly, though he did disclose that a donation of $15,000 would have earned contributors a tour of Odessa and Kiev ""after we liberate them"". Bentley is asking for a minimum of $9,000 for the book project, and at the time of writing has raised more than half that amount. BBC Trending approached Bentley for an interview and he declined to talk to us, but after contacting him and Indiegogo, all mention of the secret perks on his campaign have now been removed. Bentley broadcasts his videos on YouTube via Essence of Time, a communist group Bentley isn't a one-off. Other Westerners have been using online crowdfunding to finance their activities in eastern Ukraine since the conflict started. Among them is 38-year-old Graham Phillips from Nottingham in the UK. Since November 2013, Phillips has been covering the conflict, broadcasting amateur videos from Donbas, often in the midst of tearing bullets and toppling buildings. His daredevil style has drawn the attention of audiences, and he boasts 86,000 subscribers on YouTube. From 2014 to 2015, Phillips was employed by Zvezda - a media channel run by the Russian Ministry of Defence, and he alsofreelanced for the state-operated TV channel RT. Phillips is highly critical of the Ukrainian government and appears to back the break-up of the country. Speaking on camera to Bentley in September 2015, Phillips accuses the Ukrainian government of ""lies and propaganda"", before adding: ""I absolutely believe that we'll win in the end."" Since May 2014, Phillips has been forbidden from entering Ukraine, on the grounds of ""national security"". The Ukrainian government even took the unusual step of issuing anopen letter,externalto UK authorities, condemning Phillips' actions. Phillips says that he's an independent journalist and claims that he has financed his activities entirely through crowdfunding from January 2016 onwards - although existing records indicate he's raised less than Â£7,500 through crowdfunding campaigns during that time. Graham Phillips is currently crowdfunding for a new period of reporting in eastern Europe At least three of his campaigns have been created to fund work in Donbas, and despite being banned from the country, he's travelled to the region frequently since May 2014. On his blog, he says he enters the region via Russia, although travelling to the area via separatist controlled border crossings iscurrently illegal under Ukrainian law,external. Because of his actions, the crowdfunding website JustGiving removed one of Phillips' appeals in July 2015. After the company was notified that Phillips was unable to legally re-enter the region, JustGiving refused to release the Â£2,000 that Phillips had raised through his campaign. Although Phillips also declined to speak to BBC Trending, he has disputed the company's actions, and his campaigns remain active on Indiegogo. Unlike Bentley, Phillips has not engaged in combat, although he has beenfilmed,externalnavigating a drone with the help of soldiers in Donbas and hasinterviewed,externalUkrainian prisoners of war. Graham Phillips on Twitter Phillips is not the only Brit who has travelled to the Ukraine conflict region. Earlier this month, Benjamin Stimson, from Manchester in the UK, wassentencedby Manchester Crown Court to five years and four months in prison for assisting separatist forces in Donbass. Phillips works with a third pro-separatist video maker - American-born Patrick Lancaster. Lancaster also describes himself as an independent journalist, and says his work is entirely funded through crowdfunding. Despite this, he seems to have raised less than $6,500 in the past eight months. Lancaster's videos have been featured by mainstream media outlets and he has contributed toThe Telegraph,externaland Sky News. However, some of his reporting has been openly hostile towards Ukraine and the West.Speaking,externalon RT in February 2015, Lancaster said that the Ukraine's current president, Petro Poroshenko, is an enemy of the people. In November 2016, Lancaster set up an Indiegogocampaign,externalto raise $2,000 for his reporting in eastern Ukraine. Donation incentives included a guided trip from Russia into the battle zone, which would have violated the Ukrainian border crossing law, although there's no evidence that anyone took up the offer. Lancaster recently removed this perk, after BBC Trending contacted both him and Indiegogo. On the same crowdfunding page, Lancaster offered military souvenirs from the Ukrainian war, including pieces of shrapnel or rubble from Donetsk airport. Yet, in an email to Trending, Lancaster distanced himself from Bentley, and said that he is not a fighter or an activist in the conflict. Indiegogo released a statement on the campaigns of Bentley, Phillips and Lancaster, telling Trending: ""Indiegogo's Trust and Safety team has reviewed these campaigns in detail and has taken steps to ensure they comply with our terms of use.""

"This video can not be played When England beat India to win Women's World Cup If you're going to win the Women's World Cup, it might as well be the biggest ever staged. When Heather Knight got her hands on the ultimate prize in women's cricket on an emotional Sunday afternoon at Lord's, it marked a triumph not only for England, but the sport itself. For Knight, kissing the silverware is a world away from four years ago, when she was clinging on to a place in an England side that failed to reach the final. But her personal transformation, and her team under coach Mark Robinson, is nothing compared to that of the women's game from a 2013 World Cup that was barely befitting of the name. Held in India, mainly Mumbai, it hardly registered with the locals in a nation where cricket is loved like no other. This video can not be played Winning the World Cup is a 'watershed' moment - England captain Knight Its very staging came under threat over a row about the presence of the Pakistan team, who were eventually shifted to the other side of the country - 1,000 miles away in Cuttack - and forced to sleep at the Barabati Stadium. The women were due to play at Mumbai's iconic Wankhede Stadium, only to be evicted to make way for men's matches. Facilities at venues were shoddy and publicity non-existent. Although global TV audiences were up, matches were played to near empty stadiums, despite entry being free of charge. ""It was shocking in India,"" former England batter Ebony Rainford-Brent told BBC Sport. ""In a cricket-crazy country, you would expect to see something - posters, adverts - but there was nothing. ""The only people in the grounds were a few family members. It was almost like the cricket wasn't happening."" Now, the World Cup doesn't just seem like a different event, but women's cricket is an entirely different sport. England triumph a 'springboard' for women's cricket Report: Shrubsole stars as England win Women's World Cup Watch the moment England won In Short: 'There's never been a better time to be a woman in cricket' The Guardian was among the newspapers to feature England's victory on Monday's front page The final at Lord's was a fitting conclusion to a tournament that has catapulted women's cricket into the national and international consciousness. What began with a marketing campaign on the London Underground and in cinemas ended in a sold-out Lord's and the most-watched game of women's cricket in history. Across the tournament, all matches were shown live for the first time, with more than 50 million watching the group games alone. Over the course of the event, the International Cricket Council expects an 80% increase in worldwide viewership. More than one million users followed England's final victory on the BBC Sport website, while the hosts' nerve-shredding semi-final victory over South Africa was also front-page news.  In the host cities - Bristol, Leicester, Derby and Taunton - 30,000 people visited fan zones. ""Everything you could think of to promote the tournament has been done,"" added Rainford-Brent. ""The investment and energy that has gone into has been incredible. To finish with a packed Lord's ticked the final box."" This video can not be played The moment England won the Women's World Cup The audience is a new one, too, riding a wave that perhaps began with last year's launch of the Twenty20 Super League, a competition that attracted an average attendance in excess of 1,000, larger than the inaugural season of its football equivalent in 2011. At the World Cup, 50% of ticket-buyers were women, while 31% of those in attendance were under the age of 16. About 13,000 tickets were given away to schools and every child at Lord's on Sunday received a plastic bat as a souvenir of the incredible final. Marie, from Surrey, was at the game with seven-year-old daughter Lucy and said: ""Lucy's dad played cricket but she has become more aware that women play too. ""We've heard a lot about women's cricket on the radio and now she is more aware that there are opportunities for her in the future if she wants to play sport."" Tom, from London, brought daughters Connie, five, and Cissie, three, to their first game of cricket. ""I thought it would be a fun game for them, with lots of entertainment going on around the edges,"" he said. Youngsters may have Knight, Tammy Beaumont and Anya Shrubsole as their new England heroes and be keen to try their hand atNatalie Sciver's Nat-meg,,externalbut India's surprise run to the final could turn out to be far more important for the future of the women's game than England's fourth world title. Four years ago, interest in the tournament on home soil was so low that, when India were dumped out in the first round, journalists (not many of them) could wander up to a lonely Mithali Raj for their own private audience with the captain. Now, even if the impressive Raj is unlikely to reach the demi-god status of Sachin Tendulkar, Virat Kohli and MS Dhoni, her country actually knows who she and her exciting team are. When India's men pulled off a shock triumph in the 1983 World Cup, it began a boom in one-day cricket. When the same teamwon the inaugural World Twenty20,externalin 2007, a nation previously pretty sniffy about the shortest form of the game threw itself into the Indian Premier League. Might India now follow the example of Australia and England to launch its own T20 league for women? Raj, Smriti Mandhana and Harmanpreet Kaur are stars that could take women's cricket to the masses. ""Why not start a league of our own in India?"" said Raj. ""Now is the right time to create that in India because women's cricket is everywhere. ""If more girls participate in leagues like that, they will improve their game and gain valuable experience."" Mark Robinson (back row, third from left) was appointed coach in November 2015 If the women's game is about to face greater commercialisation, exposure and expectation then England are lucky to have Robinson, a man who should take his share of credit for their triumph. When the former fast bowler made the surprise switch from Sussex's men's side, England's results had been patchy for some time. Although they had won two of the previous three Ashes series, they were without a global trophy since 2009. When that record was extended with a semi-final exit at the 2016 World T20, Robinson made his move. Ifhis public attack on the players' fitnessraised eyebrows, then the axing of captain Charlotte Edwards was genuinely stunning - not least to some inside the England and Wales Cricket Board. Edwards was (and still is) a fine player, one of the greatest there has ever been in the women's game, but her maternal, dominant presence could be stifling and suffocating. Too often, England were reliant on the performances of a handful of players, with the rest left to feel like they were making up the numbers. In the past year, Beaumont, Lauren Winfield, Fran Wilson and Alex Hartley have all established themselves at international level. Knight averages more with the bat as captain than she did in the ranks and Sarah Taylor has returned from a break enforced by an anxiety problem. Tears and a house called Alan - inside story of England's band of sisters But it is not just on the field where Robinson has made changes. In a game just getting to grips with professionalism, players previously signed one-year contracts. Recognising that meant they were faced with the threat of unemployment on an annual basis, Robinson successfully pushed for the security of two-year deals. He has also created an environment of honesty, openness and acceptance in a bid to make sure the players do not lose their identities to the rigors of the game. One player was comfortable enough to bring her teddy bear to a team meeting. ""Mark has been brilliant,"" said Knight. ""He has encouraged us to be honest and that has made us as a team. ""He has annoyed us at times with tough love, but he has pushed us, improved us and made us believe. We're very thankful."" Robinson, though, will not be in the limelight in the aftermath of England's triumph, and nor should he be. The adulation goes to Knight and the 14 other players that have triumphed in the biggest tournament, match and spectacle women's cricket has ever seen. They are role models in a game that is taking its place at global sport's top table. Who runs the world? Girls.

"Chlorinated chicken is a familiar feature on US shelves but is banned in the EU Liam Fox has downplayed talk that a future US-UK trade deal after Brexit could be threatened by disagreements over chlorinated chicken imports. The international trade secretary said the issue of whether the current UK ban on chlorine-washed poultry would be lifted was ""a detail of the very end stage of one sector"" of future talks. The EU bans imports on health grounds but free market groups want a rethink. Downing Street said any trade deal must work for both consumers and farmers. Mr Fox is in Washington DC for two days of talks with US officials about the existing transatlantic trade relationship and how this will change once the UK leaves the EU in March 2019. Although the UK cannot seal a free trade deal of its own with the US until it leaves the EU, both sides have expressed a desire to make quick progress and to scope out some of the barriers to an expedited deal. UK and US to start trade deal talks Welsh farming's post-Brexit warning The EU currently bans imports of poultry meat which is rinsed in chlorine and it will be up to the UK to decide, after it leaves the EU, whether this ban stays in place. Environmental campaigners have expressed concerns that the UK's desire for a quick deal could pave the way for the ban to be lifted as well as a loosening of other restrictions on imports of unlabelled genetically modified (GM) foods and beef from cattle implanted with growth hormones. Concerns about differing EU and US standards were among issues that resulted in the two sides failing to agree a comprehensive trade and investment partnership last year. In the US, it is legal to wash chicken carcasses in strongly chlorinated water. Producers argue that it mitigates the spread of microbial contamination from the animal's digestive tract to the meat while regulators agree The practice is banned in the EU on health grounds, arguing it could increase the risk of bacterial-based diseases such as salmonella on the grounds that dirty abattoirs with sloppy standards would rely on it as a decontaminant rather than making sure their basic hygiene protocols were up to scratch. There are also concerns that such ""washes"" would be used by less scrupulous meat processing plants to increase the shelf-life of meat, making it appear fresher than it really is. Asked whether he would be happy eating chlorinated chicken, Mr Fox suggested that the British media was ""obsessed"" by the issue and asked whether reporters would be shunning US chicken during their visit. In what he described as the ""complex"" process of negotiating an over-arching deal to advance the mutual prosperity of the US and UK people, he suggested the issue ranked low down on his list of current priorities. Speaking more broadly, Mr Fox said discussions about global trade too often focused around talk about the interests of producers and jobs rather than the needs of consumers as people. ""We have to make the case for free trade and consumer gains,"" he said. On Sunday, he conceded that reciprocal access to markets for agri-food products were one of the hardest-fought elements of trade deals and often among the last areas to be agreed. There have been reports of disagreement in the Cabinet over the issue of chicken imports. Mr Fox said the UK and the US had to make the case for the further liberalisation of global trade Environment Secretary Michael Gove has said the UK will retain existing standards of environmental and animal welfare outside of the EU and that his goal was to improve them further. Speaking last week, he said there would be ""no compromise"" on standards and that he believed being a world leader in free trade and animal welfare should not be incompatible. Free market economists have called for the UK to permit imports of chlorinated chicken as a goodwill gesture to help facilitate a comprehensive trade deal. The Adam Smith Institute said there was no evidence that eating chlorinated chicken in moderation posed any risk to human health. In a report published on Monday, it said lifting restrictions would be good for hard-pressed consumers as a kilo of chicken was 21% cheaper in the US than its UK equivalent. ""Trade critics like to suggest that signing a deal with the USA will mean that Brits will be forced to eat unsafe produce,"" said its author Peter Spence. ""In reality, chlorinated chicken is so harmless that even the EU's own scientific advisers have declared that it is ""of no safety concern."" ""Agreeing to US poultry imports would help to secure a quick US trade deal, and bring down costs for British households. European opposition to US agricultural exports has held up trade talks for years."" Asked whether the government was guaranteeing to maintain EU-level food standards after Brexit, a Downing Street spokesman said: ""Our position when it comes to food is that maintaining the safety and public confidence in the food we eat is of the highest priority ""Any future trade deal must work for UK farmers, businesses and consumers.""

"Sunderland fan Bradley Lowery was a mascot against Everton then for them Everton will host a charity football match in celebration of Bradley Lowery, the club has announced.

"It must be serious. They've deployed the Royals. The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge have been on tour in Germany with a very specific purpose: to reassure the country that Brexit doesn't mean the break-up of a beautiful relationship. Prince William, after speaking a few words in German, told guests at a British embassy garden party: ""This relationship between UK and Germany really matters, it will continue despite Britain's recent decision to leave the European Union. I am confident we will remain the firmest of friends."" But since the British election, German politicians are more troubled than ever about Brexit. The German council for foreign relations' director, Daniela Schwarzer, told me: ""Policymakers in Berlin are surprised and worried at the degree of confusion in London, the lack of clarity as to the strategy the UK wants to follow. ""There is a lot surprise about how the negotiations are being handled and the somewhat incoherent messages which come out of London."" Of course, Germany is just one country in the European Union - but it is first among equals, its chancellor by far the most senior politician, with a new and determined ally in President Macron, who's refreshed the Franco-German alliance. Even before Brexit became a reality, there's been an argument, almost an assumption, that German industry would put pressure on German politicians to argue for a good deal for the UK - access to the European market without having to abide by the rules. The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge recently toured Germany So far, Mrs Merkel has been adamant: no cherry picking. Will German industry push her to change her mind? I visited the Trumpf company in Stuttgart, a concern with a turnover of 3bn euros (Â£2.7bn) a year that makes sheet metal, laser cutters and machine tools. It employs 4,000 people in Germany and another 8,000 globally: in the USA, China, Japan, South Korea - and in Luton, Southampton and Rugby. The company's Heidi Maier tells me orders from the UK are up because people have got used to the idea of Brexit. ""Despite political insecurities and decisions we don't like and we don't back, our business is doing very well,"" she says. We stand in front of the True Punch 5000. The machine is swift and certain, precise and elegant, all the qualities that make Germans so proud of their engineering prowess. The exact opposite of these qualities - slowness and uncertainty - is what worries German industry about Brexit. German Mittelstand wants 'soft Brexit' Brexiteers in warning to German business Brexit: UK offer on EU citizens a good start, says Merkel Brexit: All you need to know about the UK leaving the EU I ask Ms Maier what they want Mrs Merkel to push for. ""What would help is decisions, and fast decisions,"" she says. ""As soon as we know the new rules, we can go ahead. We are actually preparing for tariffs, which is the implication [of what the British government is saying], which would worsen our business. The goods we produce in Great Britain would become more expensive due to the tariffs, and we don't know how our customers would react to that."" Most German businesses tend to lobby government through powerful trade associations. And one industry has more horsepower than any other. Germany's glittering car industry is an industrial giant with immense political clout and a 400bn euro turnover, employing 800,000 people. And the relationship with the UK is very important. One in seven cars exported from Germany goes to the UK, its single biggest market. The Trumpf machine is just one example of German high-tech engineering Ever since Brexit was a speck on the horizon, enthusiasts for leaving have argued the mighty German auto industry wouldn't allow politicians to punish Britain, a point I put to Matthias Wissman, the president of the VDA, the German automotive industry association. ""What we want is to keep the European Union of the 27 together,"" he says. ""That is the first priority. Second priority is to have a trade area with the UK with no tariff barriers, no non-tariff barriers. That is possible if the UK understands what the preconditions are. ""We want a good deal for Britain, but the best deal for Britain would be to stay in the customs union. Anything else would be worse for both sides. The best thing would be to stay in the internal market, like Norway."" He accused pro-Brexiteers of making ""totally unrealistic"" promises. ""I see a lot which is astonishing for a friend of Great Britain. I miss the traditional British pragmatism. We would like to have it in the future, but I see more and more ideological points of view which make pragmatism very difficult and unfortunately in both parties, Conservative and Labour."" The UK is the German auto industry's biggest export market When I put to him Liam Fox's view that a trade deal with the EU could be ""one of the easiest in human history"", he laughs and says it would take years and years but ""time is running out"". ""You need a transition period. And if you want an easy solution, stay in the customs union and the internal market. ""A transition period would also be very pragmatic. We hope that on the British side that gets deeper and deeper into the intellectual capabilities of those who decide."" This is not just the view of one man, or one industry. There seems to be a consensus among the industrial powerbrokers. Klaus Deutsch of the federation of German industry, the BDI, makes it clear they did not want Brexit in the first place and would like the UK to stay in the single market and observe all the rules. But that's not the government's intention, so what follows? ""We would favour a comprehensive agreement. But the most important thing is legal certainty in the period from A to B.  If you don't have a transition period of many years, then there will be a huge disruption to all sorts of businesses. ""The concern of business is unless you get a clear cut and legally safe agreement, you can't sell pharmaceuticals, or cars or what have you, across the Channel, you have to stop business, divest, change business models."" Will Germany prioritise EU unity over its economic relationship with the UK? He makes it clear only the British government can decide what it wants, but what about the idea they'll push Mrs Merkel to soften her approach? ""That's completely unlikely,"" Mr Deutsch says. ""The importance of the European Union for German corporates is even higher than the importance of a bilateral relationship with the United Kingdom. So, the priority of safeguardingâ¦ the unity of the European Union is much more important than one economic relationship. There are a lot of illusions - it won't happen."" Speaking on BBC Radio 4's The World This Weekend programme, Owen Paterson, the former cabinet minister, who recently visited Germany, told me he had felt a ""sense of denial"" in the country over Brexit. ""It is hugely in everyone's interest that we maintain reciprocal free trade and as we have absolute conformity of standards, everyone should get their head round that,"" he told me. ""Whereas [the Germans] are still thinking entirely in terms of remaining in the current institutions and that's clearly what we are not going to do. ""We're not going to stay in the single market. We are not going to stay in the customs union. We're certainly not going to stay under the remit of the European Court of Justice. I found that that was something they had not really got their heads round."" And my overriding impression of the view of the big beasts of Germany industry? Frustration that they don't know where the British government wants to head and a strong sense that any outcome will be worse than what exists. But also, a total rejection of the idea that the economic relationship with the UK outweighs the German interest in European unity. How could customs union deal work?

"Central parts of Schaffhausen have been sealed off by police Police are hunting for a man who attacked five people with a chainsaw in the Swiss town of Schaffhausen. Franz Wrousis is alleged to have launched his assault at a health insurance office shortly after 10:30 local time (08:30 GMT). The attack sparked a manhunt involving more than 100 officers from both Switzerland and Germany. Police say the 51-year-old, who lives in the woods, is dangerous and believed to be still armed with the chainsaw. His exact motives are still not clear, but police Major Ravi Landolt told a news conference: ""This is not an attack against a hypothetical person. This is clearly against people from the insurer."" Swiss police are searching for this man Mr Wrousis, who has two previous convictions for weapons offences, is reported to have entered the offices in Schaffhausen on Monday morning. He then allegedly attacked a number of people working in the branch of health insurance company CSS. At least one employee was left with serious injuries, but is now out of danger. On Monday afternoon, police said the vehicle he was believed to be driving - a white Volkswagen - had been found, but Mr Wrousis remained at large. People living near the woods just outside the city confirmed to Switzerland's20 Minuten,external(in German) that Mr Wrousis had been living in the area for at least a couple of weeks. One resident told the news site they had reported him to police on two occasions after he verbally attacked them. Schaffhausen is the capital of the Swiss canton of the same name.

"This video can not be played Kushner: 'Stop ridiculing Trump voters' Donald Trump's son-in-law has defended his conduct in last year's presidential campaign, after giving evidence to a Senate panel investigating Russian interference in the election. Jared Kushner said all of his ""actions were proper and occurred in the normal course of events"" of the campaign. Mr Kushner, 36, has also denied any collusion with Russia. He is a senior adviser to the president and was in charge of the campaign's digital strategy. He is married to Mr Trump's daughter, Ivanka. Speaking at the White House after a closed-door session of the Senate Intelligence Committee, Mr Kushner said he had been ""fully transparent in providing all the requested information"". ""Let me be very clear - I did not collude with Russia, nor do I know of anyone else in the campaign who did so. I had no improper contacts,"" he said. Mr Kushner, who keeps a very low media profile, will appear before the equivalent House of Representatives committee on Tuesday. Jared Kushner's full 11-page statement,external Russia: The 'cloud' over the Trump White House How Trump's Russia trouble unfolded In a statement,externalto both congressional committees released before the Senate session on Monday, he said there were ""hardly any"" contacts with Russian representatives, adding later that there were ""perhaps four"". This video can not be played The BBC's Sarah Rainsford tries to get Russian pop star Emin Agalarov to comment on his links to Donald Trump. He refers to a meeting with Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya in June last year. She had allegedly promised damaging material on Hillary Clinton. Mr Kushner said he arrived late at the meeting, realised little of note was being discussed and that it was ""time not well-spent"". Where Trump is seen as saviour Is Kushner the most powerful 36-year-old in the world? Jared Kushner: The son-in-law with Donald Trump's ear Mr Trump Jr said former campaign chief Paul Manafort was also at the meeting and that no compromising material on Mrs Clinton was provided. Ambassador Sergei Kislyak(above). Brief meeting of ""pleasantries"" in April 2016 in Washington. Meeting at Trump Tower on 1 December. Discussed Syria and trying to improve relations. Mr Kushner insists he did not suggest a ""secret back channel"" for communication or discuss sanctions. Mr Kislyak's term ended on Saturday Sergei Gorkov. Mr Kushner says he met the banker on 12 December at the request of Mr Kislyak, who presented him as a man with direct links to President Vladimir Putin. Mr Kushner insists he did not discuss sanctions, business interests or specific policy issues and has had no contacts with him since Guccifer400. Mr Kushner says he received a ""random email"" trying to extort 52 bitcoins in exchange for not publishing Mr Trump's tax details. Mr Kushner says he ignored the email Natalia Veselnitskaya. Mr Kushner said he had not spoken to the lawyer before or since the June 2016 meeting and had forgotten about it until an email exchange involving President Trump's son, Donald Jr, came to light last month. He says: ""No part of the meeting I attended included anything about the campaign, there was no follow up to the meeting that I am aware of, I do not recall how many people were there (or their names), and I have no knowledge of any documents being offered or accepted."" In his statement, Mr Kushner accepted that he failed initially to reveal his contacts with Russians. He says the first form, a ""rough draft that still had many omissions"", was filed by an assistant in error on 18 January and that declarations on his foreign contacts, not just with Russians, were added over the next six months ""in the normal course"". Mr Trump Jr and Mr Manafort had been scheduled to appear before Congress on Wednesday to testify but that has been delayed indefinitely as lawyers negotiate on the documentation and information to be discussed. Anthony Zurcher, BBC North America reporter In his Senate testimony Jared Kushner says he has nothing to hide and is ""happy"" to share information with those investigating possible Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential campaign. His written statement, however, is an exercise in caution and lawyerly discretion. He addresses only the controversies already in the public sphere, then offers his explanation for why they are no big deal. He receives hundreds of emails a day and didn't read his brother-in-law's forwarded message that said the Russian government wanted to help the Trump campaign. Reports of an effort to set up back-channel communications with Russia after the election were a halted effort to get information about Syria from Russian generals. He met with an influential Russian banker because the Russian ambassador - whose name he couldn't initially remember - was so persistent. The incomplete security form was the result of a ""miscommunication"" with an assistant who submitted it too soon. Beyond that, there are no new revelations; no new disclosures. If what's already out is all there is, Mr Kushner and his lawyers have done their best to defuse the bombs. When walking in a minefield, it's the ones you don't know about that pose the greatest risk. President Trump has repeatedly denied any collusion with Russia. He continued his tirade against the investigation process on Sunday, tweeting: ""As the phony Russian Witch Hunt continues, two groups are laughing at this excuse for a lost election taking hold, Democrats and Russians!""

"Two F-15 fighter jets like these were not prevented by military air traffic control from entering same airspace as an RAF Voyager Two US fighter jets and an RAF tanker aircraft came within seconds of a mid-air crash, a report has revealed. The pilot of the RAF Voyager tanker claimed one of the US F-15s flew as close as 50m (160ft) before roaring past to avoid a collision. The tanker pilot claimed he could the feel turbulence from the F15 flying at 402mph as it boosted its speed. TheAirprox Board,externalblamed the near-miss on a military air traffic controller becoming distracted by a phone call. It added confusion had also been caused over the geographic naming of the refuelling area in the Wash. The incident happened in January this year at a height of 16,000ft, about 10 miles off the coast of north Norfolk, after the Voyager from RAF Brize Norton had refuelled two RAF Typhoons in mid-air. The pilot of the RAF Voyager, like the one pictured here, reported the encounter immediately The report found that a military air traffic controller based at Swanwick, Hampshire, misunderstood the flight path of the F15 pilots, thinking they were flying south in the geographic Wash area. But the US crews from RAF Lakenheath, Suffolk, were referring to the Wash Aerial Tactics Area (ATA) further north, which was also the refuelling area where the tanker was flying. Area where collision averted The report said the controller was further distracted after he ""answered a landline that was not his responsibility, and had became embroiled in a distracting and complicated"" call. It added this ""served to further increase his workload and resulted in him focusing on that task rather than on the F15s"". The investigation found that pilots of the F15s had been flying visually at the time so had failed to spot the Voyager on their radar. The UK Airprox Board concluded that given that the F15 pilot was unaware of the Voyager until it was so close, there was a ""serious risk of collision where luck had played a major part"" in avoiding one. It was classified as a Category A - the highest risk. The Board welcomed the joint US and UK air force investigation which recommended changes to ""include a review of the naming of the Wash ATA areas to avoid future confusion"".

"Some Andrex toilet rolls have got shorter As many as 2,529 products have shrunk in size over the past five years, but are being sold for the same price, official figures show. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said it was not just chocolate bars that have been subject to so-called ""shrinkflation"". It said toilet rolls, coffee and fruit juice were also being sold in smaller packet sizes. Andrex admitted its rolls were smaller, but said they were now better quality. At the same time the ONS said 614 products had got larger between 2012 and 2017. Five products hit by shrinkflation The ONS said,externalthe phenomenon of shrinkflation had not had an impact on the overall inflation figures. However, in the category of sugar, jam, syrups chocolate and confectionery, the rate of inflation when adjusted for shrinking products was significantly higher. Since 2012, the inflation rate for products such as chocolate was actually 1.22 percentage points higher, when the smaller size was taken into account. Andrex toilet tissue, which used the catchline ""Soft, strong and long"" alongside the famous Labrador puppy, has shrunk its rolls from 280 sheets originally, first to 240 sheets, and more recently to 221 sheets, according to Which? The company told the BBC that even though the roll was smaller, the product itself was better. ""Reducing the roll by a number of sheets has helped us make this multi-million pound investment in product performance possible,"" a spokesperson said. ""Consumer pricing is solely in the domain of the retailer."" Dozens of chocolate bars and sweets have already got smaller. Packets of Maltesers have shrunk from 121g to 103g, a reduction of 15%. Makers Mars have said it was a way of helping consumers afford the product. Why are our chocolates getting smaller? Mind the gap: Toblerone gets fewer triangles Toblerone has shrunk by 12%, with larger spaces between the triangular ""mountains"". The manufacturers, Mondelez - formerly Kraft - said they changed the shape ""to keep the product affordable"". It said it was experiencing higher costs for ""numerous"" ingredients. The 150g Toblerone features larger gaps between its distinctive triangles The ONS has cast doubt on whether raw material costs are really rising. The European import price of sugar has been falling since the middle of 2014, and reached a record low in March 2017, the ONS said. The price of cocoa, another major ingredient, reached a five-year high in December 2015, but has fallen sharply over the last year. The ONS also dismissed Brexit as a reason for recent shrinkflation, even though it has contributed to an increase in the price of some imported goods. ""Our analysis doesn't show a noticeable change following the referendum that would point to a Brexit effect,"" the ONS said.

"Brazilian TV host Raul Gil came under fire for making a ""slant eye"" gesture while interviewing Korean pop group KARD South Koreans and Brazilians have become embroiled in an online battle after racially insensitive comments and gestures were made on air by a popular TV host. The spat began when the South Korean K-pop group KARD appeared on a TV show presented by well-known Brazilian personality Raul Gil. Gil began with relatively innocuous banter, asking KARD members if they were single. But when the crowd cheered, he asked why they were reacting in such a way, and made a ""slant-eye"" gesture. Later in the programme the host made a related jibe about a Japanese youngster who appeared on his show, telling him that he ""had better open his eyes."" Brazil has the largest Japanese population of any country outside of Japan. It's estimated that just under 1.5 million people of Japanese descent live in Brazil out of a total population of more than 200 million. By contrast only about 50,000 people of Korean descent are estimated to be living in Brazil. The broadcast kicked off a huge reaction in South Korea, where furious users of the web portal Nate sounded off about Gil and Brazil in general. One person condemned the airing of ""xenophobic"" and ""racist"" attitudes, while others attacked the appearance of the TV host and unfavourably compared Brazil's economic situation to Korea's. ""That presenter is so fat... vulgar human"" said one. Another commented that Brazil is ""much poorer"" than Korea, ""so why are they insulting us?"" Another referenced Brazil'shumiliating 7-1 defeatat the hands of Germany during the 2014 World Cup. In response to the backlash, the hashtag ""Do you want Korea"" began trending on Twitter. Picked up mainly by Portuguese-speaking social media users, it has since been used more than 400,000 times. Messages unfavourably compared Korea to Brazil and pointed out instances of alleged Korean racism. One user suggested that Koreans prefer lighter skin tones, while others made references to the use of black face on Korean TV. In April 2017, a South Korean TV stationapologised,externalafter a comedy show featured a character in blackface. Translation: 'Korea: Brazil is a racist country. [But] when a celebrity who is tanned visits Korea ... '. One of the first people to use the hashtag, Ana Luiza, told BBC Trending that the hashtag was driven by Brazilian fans of ""K-pop""- the music genre which originates in South Korea. ""We obviously know that Korea is no flower,"" she told Trending. ""[In Korea there is] blackface on TV, and mixed-race people suffer prejudice. They wanted to spread their prejudice, so we decided to retaliate in a comical way."" She added: ""We didn't expect it to be so big. But Brazilians on the internet are very active, and so is the K-pop community.""

It started after a meme went viral in Portugal - but had widely circulated amongst Brazilians the year before. The tweet, in Portuguese, says: ""To pick up a fight with Brazil, you've got to have guts. Just ask Portugal"". Bruno Garcez, a BBC digital editor from Brazil, says it's no surprise that a combative hashtag emerged from the South American country. ""In the past, social media users from Brazil have taken on Portuguese netizens and even the singer Azaelia Banks, who had her Facebook account blocked after it was reported by Brazilian web users,"" he says. ""Organised calls for action often lead to quick responses."" He adds: ""The trouble is that even when reacting to an offensive or racist remark, many Brazilian netizens, although often starting on the right side of the argument, frequently lose the plot somewhere along the line and then veer into racist and offensive remarks themselves as well.""

"Two F-15 fighter jets like these were not prevented by military air traffic control from entering same airspace as an RAF Voyager Two US fighter jets and an RAF tanker aircraft came within seconds of a mid-air crash, a report has revealed. The pilot of the RAF Voyager tanker claimed one of the US F-15s flew as close as 50m (160ft) before roaring past to avoid a collision. The tanker pilot claimed he could the feel turbulence from the F15 flying at 402mph as it boosted its speed. TheAirprox Board,externalblamed the near-miss on a military air traffic controller becoming distracted by a phone call. It added confusion had also been caused over the geographic naming of the refuelling area in the Wash. The incident happened in January this year at a height of 16,000ft, about 10 miles off the coast of north Norfolk, after the Voyager from RAF Brize Norton had refuelled two RAF Typhoons in mid-air. The pilot of the RAF Voyager, like the one pictured here, reported the encounter immediately The report found that a military air traffic controller based at Swanwick, Hampshire, misunderstood the flight path of the F15 pilots, thinking they were flying south in the geographic Wash area. But the US crews from RAF Lakenheath, Suffolk, were referring to the Wash Aerial Tactics Area (ATA) further north, which was also the refuelling area where the tanker was flying. Area where collision averted The report said the controller was further distracted after he ""answered a landline that was not his responsibility, and had became embroiled in a distracting and complicated"" call. It added this ""served to further increase his workload and resulted in him focusing on that task rather than on the F15s"". The investigation found that pilots of the F15s had been flying visually at the time so had failed to spot the Voyager on their radar. The UK Airprox Board concluded that given that the F15 pilot was unaware of the Voyager until it was so close, there was a ""serious risk of collision where luck had played a major part"" in avoiding one. It was classified as a Category A - the highest risk. The Board welcomed the joint US and UK air force investigation which recommended changes to ""include a review of the naming of the Wash ATA areas to avoid future confusion"".

"The Biggest Weekend will run from 25-28 May With Glastonbury taking a year off in 2018, there's already one new festival hoping to fill the mud-and-music gap. The BBC has announced plans to host The Biggest Weekend while Glasto has its traditional fallow year. The four-day festival will take place in May across four sites in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. The last time Glastonbury had a year off, in 2012, BBC Radio 1 brought its Big Weekend festival to Hackney. It coincided with the London Olympics, which took place in the capital a few weeks after the festival. The Biggest Weekend is scheduled for the late May bank holiday weekend (25-28 May) - earlier than when Glastonbury normally is. More than 175,000 tickets will be made available, which is more than the number sold for Glasto, but this one is across four locations. The BBC said it will bring ""the biggest artists in the world"" to the event - but headliners won't be announced for some time yet. Those who don't fancy the mud and rain will be able to watch and listen to the coverage on various BBC outlets. More than 175,000 tickets will be made available for the event Radio 1, Radio 2, Radio 3 and 6 Music will all broadcast live sets from the weekend, while BBC Two and BBC Four will lead the TV coverage. Don't worry if you're away that weekend - because all the sets will also be available on BBC iPlayer. Bob Shennan, director of BBC radio and music, said the corporation ""has a strong history of bringing the nation together for some special moments, and this is the biggest single music event ever attempted by the BBC"". ""We will be celebrating the diversity of music from four different corners of the country, bringing the best UK music to the world and the best global music to the UK."" Katy Perry headlined BBC Radio 1's Big Weekend in Hull this year The festival will be for one year only and there are no plans for it to become an annual event. Glastonbury takes a break every five to six years to prevent excessive damage to the site. Follow us onFacebook,external, on Twitter@BBCNewsEnts,external, or on Instagram atbbcnewsents,external.

"Radio 2 DJ Sara Cox was sent letters handwritten in felt-tip pen A convicted paedophile who stalked BBC Radio 2 DJ Sara Cox has been jailed. Anthony Collins, 50, from Chatham, who admitted harassment, sent letters to Cox and told her he was psychologically disturbed and had a criminal past but wanted her to invite him to the BBC. When police arrested him, they found he had a fake BBC visitor's pass, Cox's sister's work address, and indecent images of girls aged four to 15. Collins, of Afghan Road, was jailed for 16 months at Maidstone Crown Court. Sentencing, Judge Martin Joy told him: ""You have an obsessive personality."" The court heard Collins bought Cox's address online and sent her letters written in felt-tip pen. Anthony Collins wrote that he was ""tall with green eyes"" but unsuccessful in his life In one letter, he told her he was living unhappily in a bedsit and asked her, to invite him to the Radio 2 studios, saying she was ""lovely, warm, kind and sexy"". He wrote: ""I'm 49, tall with green eyes. I know you are married to Ben Cyzer and know he is a successful man. I'm unsuccessful in my life."" He also wrote to Cox's husband at his workplace - the letter included a picture of Cox holding a child, and a diagram with the words ""Cancer Analysis"" in capital letters. Live: More news from Kent Prosecutor Mary Jacobson said: ""Needless to say that when Ms Cox found out her husband had received a letter she was immediately much more scared, as she put it, and the matter was reported to the police."" The court heard when Collins was arrested he said he ""wanted to be in the news"" and admitted his actions amounted to harassment. Officers found the indecent images in Collins's bedside drawers and discovered more unposted letters as well as pictures and press cuttings. Collins had pleaded guilty to possessing indecent images and making indecent images of children. The court was told he had a criminal history that included an 18-month jail term for poisoning a 13-year-old girl in a bid to sedate her and have sex with her. Collins had also broken a restraining order by speaking to two girls aged six and seven and making lewd comments. In mitigation, defence counsel Ian Dear said Collins's actions towards Cox amounted to harassment but had not intended to cause alarm or distress, adding it was ""a cry for help"". Collins was given a Sexual Harm Prevention Order and a restraining order.

"Rainfall in January 2014 was unprecedented in Met Office records There is an increased risk of ""unprecedented"" winter downpours such as those that caused extensive flooding in 2014, the UK Met Office says. Their study suggests there's now a one in three chance of monthly rainfall records being broken in England and Wales in winter. The estimate reflects natural variability plus changes in the UK climate as a result of global warming. But a supercomputer was needed to understand the scale of increased risk. Across the winter of 2013-14, a series of storms hit the UK leading to extensive flooding in many parts. The amount of rain that fell in much of southern England and the Midlands was the heaviest in 100 years. Cleaning up from the resulting floods took time and money - the bill for the Thames valley alone was over Â£1bn. Met Office researchers say that there was nothing in the observational record to indicate that such an unprecedented amount of rainfall was possible. However, by using a climate model that takes the current climate period from 1981-2015 as its base, and running it hundreds of times on the Met Office supercomputer, researchers were able to find many modelled months with similar or greater rainfall to January 2014. The record breaking rainfall of early 2014 caused extensive flooding Their analysis also showed a high risk of record-breaking rainfall in England and Wales in the coming decade. ""We found many unprecedented events in the model data and this comes out as a 7% risk of a monthly record extreme in a given winter in the next few years, that's just over Southeast England,"" Dr Vikki Thompson, the study's lead author told BBC News. ""Looking at all the regions of England and Wales we found a 34% chance of an extreme event happening in at least one of those regions each year."" Not only is there a greater risk, but the researchers were also able to estimate that these events could break existing records by up to 30%. ""That is an enormous number, to have a monthly value that's 30% larger, it's a bit like what we had in 2014, and as much again,"" said Prof Adam Scaife from the Met Office. Key to developing this new understanding of the risk of record rainfall has been adding the power of a supercomputer to create hundreds of realistic UK winter scenarios in addition to the observational record. Other experts believe that the new work will be very important to policy makers. ""Although this year has been particularly dry, generally our winters are getting wetter and the rainfall heavier, so we are seeing more flooding and records broken,"" said Prof Piers Forster from the University of Leeds who was not involved with the study. ""We expect the odds to shorten on future rainfall extremes but the first stage to predict this is knowing the current odds - and this is what this new paper gives us."" One of the key questions though is how much of a role does climate change play in increasing the risk of these large scale downpours? ""There's a good chance of a record and there's a good chance that it would be much bigger than the current record,"" said Prof Scaife. ""We are not attributing this directly to climate change, what we are saying is that if you take in everything that's in the climate system today then that is the risk. Climate change is already happening and we've already got some and that is folded in here."" The Army was needed to help with the scale of flooding in January and February 2014 The new research approach has been dubbed the UNSEEN method, to emphasise that this work anticipates events that have not yet been seen. It was also used as part of the UK government's National Flood Resilience Review (NFRR) when the Met Office were asked to estimate the potential and severity of record breaking rainfall over the next decade. Thatreview,externalled the government to adopt new stress tests to assess the risk of flooding from the rivers and seas. However there were concerns that the NFRR didn't consider surface water flooding which can affect more homes and businesses. Some critics believe that in light of this new research, the review should be re-visited. ""It should be an urgent priority for the Environment Secretary to re-open the National Flood Resilience Review with the aim of improving the UK's preparedness against surface water flooding caused by heavy rainfall, the risks of which are clearly spelled out in this paper,"" said Bob Ward, from the the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change.

"Ben Needham vanished on the Greek island of Kos in July 1991 Signs of blood have been found on part of a sandal and on soil inside a toy car recovered by police searching for missing Sheffield toddler Ben Needham. Ben was 21 months old when he disappeared on the Greek island of Kos in July 1991. South Yorkshire Police said forensic work was being carried out in Aberdeen to try to extract DNA from the items. Det Insp Jon Cousins said it was still his ""professional belief"" Ben died in an accident at the farmhouse. Live updates and more stories from Yorkshire Details of the findings have been released on the 26th anniversary of Ben's disappearance. The car found in Kos is thought to be similar to this one Ben was last seen playing near to a farmhouse his grandfather was renovating Ben went missing while playing near a farmhouse, which was being renovated by his grandfather in Iraklis. An extensive21-day searchof land around the building and a second site 750m (820 yards) away took place in October after it emerged the toddlermay have been crushed to death by a diggerworking on the site. About 60 items discovered during the search were brought back to the UK for analysis, some of which were sent for testing at the James Hutton Institute in Aberdeen. South Yorkshire Police were assisted by members of the Hellenic Rescue Team and Red Cross The search of the two sites was carried out over 21 days in October Professor Lorna Dawson, head of the soil forensics group, said the team of scientists had discovered the ""profile indicative of human blood decomposition on a fragment of a sandal."" The profile had also been found on soil from inside a toy car, however, the stronger signal had been found on the footwear sandal, she said. Professor Dawson said the discovery was the ""chemical finger print"" of compounds left behind ""when there has been decomposition or decay"". ""There's a strong indication from this chemical profile that this was present on those items as a result of blood decomposition,"" she said. ""It's significant in identifying that there had been a human who had bled in contact with those items. ""The biologist has to come in now and identify who left that blood on that item by extracting the DNA."" Professor Lorna Dawson was part of the team responsible for analysing the items Det Insp Cousins said: ""Based on the facts and the information obtained, as previously stated it is still my professional belief that Ben died as a result of a tragic incident at the farmhouse involving heavy machinery. ""It's my belief that [the findings] corroborate and strengthen that theory."" The Needham family has been informed and the force would continue to assist the Greek authorities with any ongoing enquiries, South Yorkshire Police said.

"This video can not be played When England beat India to win Women's World Cup If you're going to win the Women's World Cup, it might as well be the biggest ever staged. When Heather Knight got her hands on the ultimate prize in women's cricket on an emotional Sunday afternoon at Lord's, it marked a triumph not only for England, but the sport itself. For Knight, kissing the silverware is a world away from four years ago, when she was clinging on to a place in an England side that failed to reach the final. But her personal transformation, and her team under coach Mark Robinson, is nothing compared to that of the women's game from a 2013 World Cup that was barely befitting of the name. Held in India, mainly Mumbai, it hardly registered with the locals in a nation where cricket is loved like no other. This video can not be played Winning the World Cup is a 'watershed' moment - England captain Knight Its very staging came under threat over a row about the presence of the Pakistan team, who were eventually shifted to the other side of the country - 1,000 miles away in Cuttack - and forced to sleep at the Barabati Stadium. The women were due to play at Mumbai's iconic Wankhede Stadium, only to be evicted to make way for men's matches. Facilities at venues were shoddy and publicity non-existent. Although global TV audiences were up, matches were played to near empty stadiums, despite entry being free of charge. ""It was shocking in India,"" former England batter Ebony Rainford-Brent told BBC Sport. ""In a cricket-crazy country, you would expect to see something - posters, adverts - but there was nothing. ""The only people in the grounds were a few family members. It was almost like the cricket wasn't happening."" Now, the World Cup doesn't just seem like a different event, but women's cricket is an entirely different sport. England triumph a 'springboard' for women's cricket Report: Shrubsole stars as England win Women's World Cup Watch the moment England won In Short: 'There's never been a better time to be a woman in cricket' The Guardian was among the newspapers to feature England's victory on Monday's front page The final at Lord's was a fitting conclusion to a tournament that has catapulted women's cricket into the national and international consciousness. What began with a marketing campaign on the London Underground and in cinemas ended in a sold-out Lord's and the most-watched game of women's cricket in history. Across the tournament, all matches were shown live for the first time, with more than 50 million watching the group games alone. Over the course of the event, the International Cricket Council expects an 80% increase in worldwide viewership. More than one million users followed England's final victory on the BBC Sport website, while the hosts' nerve-shredding semi-final victory over South Africa was also front-page news.  In the host cities - Bristol, Leicester, Derby and Taunton - 30,000 people visited fan zones. ""Everything you could think of to promote the tournament has been done,"" added Rainford-Brent. ""The investment and energy that has gone into has been incredible. To finish with a packed Lord's ticked the final box."" This video can not be played The moment England won the Women's World Cup The audience is a new one, too, riding a wave that perhaps began with last year's launch of the Twenty20 Super League, a competition that attracted an average attendance in excess of 1,000, larger than the inaugural season of its football equivalent in 2011. At the World Cup, 50% of ticket-buyers were women, while 31% of those in attendance were under the age of 16. About 13,000 tickets were given away to schools and every child at Lord's on Sunday received a plastic bat as a souvenir of the incredible final. Marie, from Surrey, was at the game with seven-year-old daughter Lucy and said: ""Lucy's dad played cricket but she has become more aware that women play too. ""We've heard a lot about women's cricket on the radio and now she is more aware that there are opportunities for her in the future if she wants to play sport."" Tom, from London, brought daughters Connie, five, and Cissie, three, to their first game of cricket. ""I thought it would be a fun game for them, with lots of entertainment going on around the edges,"" he said. Youngsters may have Knight, Tammy Beaumont and Anya Shrubsole as their new England heroes and be keen to try their hand atNatalie Sciver's Nat-meg,,externalbut India's surprise run to the final could turn out to be far more important for the future of the women's game than England's fourth world title. Four years ago, interest in the tournament on home soil was so low that, when India were dumped out in the first round, journalists (not many of them) could wander up to a lonely Mithali Raj for their own private audience with the captain. Now, even if the impressive Raj is unlikely to reach the demi-god status of Sachin Tendulkar, Virat Kohli and MS Dhoni, her country actually knows who she and her exciting team are. When India's men pulled off a shock triumph in the 1983 World Cup, it began a boom in one-day cricket. When the same teamwon the inaugural World Twenty20,externalin 2007, a nation previously pretty sniffy about the shortest form of the game threw itself into the Indian Premier League. Might India now follow the example of Australia and England to launch its own T20 league for women? Raj, Smriti Mandhana and Harmanpreet Kaur are stars that could take women's cricket to the masses. ""Why not start a league of our own in India?"" said Raj. ""Now is the right time to create that in India because women's cricket is everywhere. ""If more girls participate in leagues like that, they will improve their game and gain valuable experience."" Mark Robinson (back row, third from left) was appointed coach in November 2015 If the women's game is about to face greater commercialisation, exposure and expectation then England are lucky to have Robinson, a man who should take his share of credit for their triumph. When the former fast bowler made the surprise switch from Sussex's men's side, England's results had been patchy for some time. Although they had won two of the previous three Ashes series, they were without a global trophy since 2009. When that record was extended with a semi-final exit at the 2016 World T20, Robinson made his move. Ifhis public attack on the players' fitnessraised eyebrows, then the axing of captain Charlotte Edwards was genuinely stunning - not least to some inside the England and Wales Cricket Board. Edwards was (and still is) a fine player, one of the greatest there has ever been in the women's game, but her maternal, dominant presence could be stifling and suffocating. Too often, England were reliant on the performances of a handful of players, with the rest left to feel like they were making up the numbers. In the past year, Beaumont, Lauren Winfield, Fran Wilson and Alex Hartley have all established themselves at international level. Knight averages more with the bat as captain than she did in the ranks and Sarah Taylor has returned from a break enforced by an anxiety problem. Tears and a house called Alan - inside story of England's band of sisters But it is not just on the field where Robinson has made changes. In a game just getting to grips with professionalism, players previously signed one-year contracts. Recognising that meant they were faced with the threat of unemployment on an annual basis, Robinson successfully pushed for the security of two-year deals. He has also created an environment of honesty, openness and acceptance in a bid to make sure the players do not lose their identities to the rigors of the game. One player was comfortable enough to bring her teddy bear to a team meeting. ""Mark has been brilliant,"" said Knight. ""He has encouraged us to be honest and that has made us as a team. ""He has annoyed us at times with tough love, but he has pushed us, improved us and made us believe. We're very thankful."" Robinson, though, will not be in the limelight in the aftermath of England's triumph, and nor should he be. The adulation goes to Knight and the 14 other players that have triumphed in the biggest tournament, match and spectacle women's cricket has ever seen. They are role models in a game that is taking its place at global sport's top table. Who runs the world? Girls.

"This video can not be played The Christmas episode is called Twice Upon A Time and features the return of Pearl Mackie as Bill Potts. Details of Peter Capaldi's final outing in Doctor Who have been revealed asthe first trailer,externalfor the Christmas special was released online. The one-minute clip for the episode, titled Twice Upon A Time, sees Capaldi and the First Doctor team up. It features the return of Pearl Mackie as Bill Potts, who had seemingly left the show at the end of series 10. The clip also showed a guest appearance from Mark Gatiss, who plays a World War One soldier called The Captain. The release of the trailer coincided with the cast appearing at Comic-Con in San Diego on Sunday, where they talked about the upcoming episode, the last series and looked back at Capaldi's time on the sci-fi drama. Gatiss described the Christmas special as being ""a Christmas episode without being overtly Christmassy - it's very happy-sad"". He added: ""[It's] a fantastic episode and we had a great time doing it. It was a lovely way out."" It will be the third time the Sherlock actor and writer has appeared on Doctor Who, after previously starring in episodes in series three and six. Mackie also confirmed the festive episode will be her last appearance on the show. Twice Upon a Time is the final episode for Peter Capaldi's Twelfth Doctor and for outgoing showrunner Steven Moffat. Both have been huge Doctor Who fans for most of their lives, and their final story is clearly a love letter to a show that means a huge amount to both. This first trailer begins with original footage of the First Doctor, William Hartnell, from 1966's The Tenth Planet (episode two if you're interested), which then mixes through to David Bradley who plays him in this story. But it also shows a glimpse of a scene with the First Doctor and his assistant Polly from episode four - Hartnell's final episode before Patrick Troughton took over. Sadly that episode is one of the dozens that are still missing from the BBC archives. The minute-long teaser also makes clear that this Christmas story won't just be accessible to long term fans. Bill will be back, after she was last seen heading off to travel the universe with student-turned-space and time traveller Heather. The trailer also shows actor and writer Mark Gatiss making another Doctor Who appearance. In 2007 he played Professor Lazarus, and he also briefly popped up playing a different character in 2011. Comic-Con fans were shown athree-minute goodbye video,externalfor Capaldi, thanking him for his time on the show, which led to a standing ovation. The actor praised writer and executive producer Steven Moffat, saying: ""Every shot you saw there came through his gentleman's mind. The message of the show comes from his heart.""

Capaldi called it ""a great choice"", adding: ""I think Jodie's going to be amazing and she's so full of excitement and full of passion about the show. It's really thrilling to know it's in the hands of somebody who cares for it so deeply and is going to do exciting things with it."" Meanwhile, Moffat criticised the ""imaginary backlash"" in the media on the issue. ""There's so many press articles about a backlash among Doctor Who fandom against the casting of a female Doctor. There has been no backlash at all,"" he said. ""[Jodie has] an 80% approval rating on social media. I wish every single journalist who is writing the alternative would shut the hell up - it's not true."" The outgoing writer and executive producer also cleared up the issue of whether the character's name is Doctor Who or the Doctor. ""There isn't any doubt about it, I'm sorry,"" Moffat said. ""It was established in The War Machines (episode) that his name is Doctor Who."" He provided evidence to back up his point, including signing letters ""Doctor W"" and the third Doctor having a ""Who"" licence plate. ""He doesn't often call himself Doctor Who because it's a bloody stupid name,"" Moffat added. On Saturday, Capalditold Empire,externalhe was both sad to be leaving the series and excited for its future. ""[The Christmas special] is a wonderful episode and I couldn't have wanted for any more.

"Central parts of Schaffhausen have been sealed off by police Police are hunting for a man who attacked five people with a chainsaw in the Swiss town of Schaffhausen. Franz Wrousis is alleged to have launched his assault at a health insurance office shortly after 10:30 local time (08:30 GMT). The attack sparked a manhunt involving more than 100 officers from both Switzerland and Germany. Police say the 51-year-old, who lives in the woods, is dangerous and believed to be still armed with the chainsaw. His exact motives are still not clear, but police Major Ravi Landolt told a news conference: ""This is not an attack against a hypothetical person. This is clearly against people from the insurer."" Swiss police are searching for this man Mr Wrousis, who has two previous convictions for weapons offences, is reported to have entered the offices in Schaffhausen on Monday morning. He then allegedly attacked a number of people working in the branch of health insurance company CSS. At least one employee was left with serious injuries, but is now out of danger. On Monday afternoon, police said the vehicle he was believed to be driving - a white Volkswagen - had been found, but Mr Wrousis remained at large. People living near the woods just outside the city confirmed to Switzerland's20 Minuten,external(in German) that Mr Wrousis had been living in the area for at least a couple of weeks. One resident told the news site they had reported him to police on two occasions after he verbally attacked them. Schaffhausen is the capital of the Swiss canton of the same name.

"Ryanair says it could cut fares by as much as 9% on some routes as competition in the airline industry intensifies in the next few months. The warning from Europe's largest carrier by passenger numbers follows similar comments about price pressures from Ryanair's rivals in recent weeks. Competition was growing as airlines switched capacity from Turkey and North Africa, Ryanair said. Separately, Ryanair said it had madea ""non-binding offer"" for Alitalia. On Friday, Italian media reported that about 10 offers had been made for the loss-making airline. In a statement, Dublin-based Ryanair said it was ""important we are involved in the process"" given that Alitalia is Italy's largest carrier. Ryanair's comments came as it reported a 55% rise in pre-tax profits to 397m euros (Â£356m) in the three months to 30 June. Revenues were up 13% to 1.68bn euros. The average fare during the quarter rose 1% to 40.3 euros, although Ryanair said this was a blip due to the much stronger Easter trading. Easter, a peak-time for holidaymakers, fell in April this year, inside the carrier's reporting period. In 2016, it fell in March. The airline said it expected fares to fall by 5% in the six months to the end of September and by 8% in the six months to the end of March 2018. ""We expect the pricing environment to remain very competitive"" chief executive Michael O'Learysaid in a statement.,externalEasyJet and Wizz Air have both said that fares will be under pressure this summer. The warning sparked a 3.5% fall in Ryanair's share price. EasyJet shares fell 3.4%, while the owner of British Airways, IAG, fell 2.7%. In a bid to recoup some lost revenues, Ryanair is considering limiting the number of passengers eligible to take a second free carry-on bag. Revenues from people paying to take luggage have fallen at the airline. Mr O'Leary told analysts that it was possible that only passengers who paid for priority boarding would be eligible. However, he added that no decision had been made. Ryanair executives also repeated warnings of major flight disruptions between the UK and Europe if Brexit talks fail to agree a bi-lateral deal on flights. The airline has warned it may cancel flights and move operations abroad if there is no agreement well in advance of Brexit. ""We need clarity so that we can plan our schedules for 2019,"" chief financial officer Neil Sorahan told the BBC. EasyJetannounced last weekthat it had secured an air operator's certificate in Austria to enable it to keep flying across the EU following Brexit.

"Susanne Langmuir sold Avon products as a teenager When Susanne Langmuir faces a big problem at Bite Beauty she asks herself: ""What would Louis do""? Louis is Louis Vuitton, the French designer who in the late 19th Century turned a small box-making shop into a global luxury brand. For Ms Langmuir, 48, ""What would Louis do?"" means: what's the correct course of action that won't compromise Bite's original values? The Bite founder says: ""Not compromising for me is about knowing what the pure idea is, and finding a way to get rid of obstacles that would interfere with that."" Her ""pure idea"" was to create line of lip products made solely from all-natural, food-grade ingredients. ""You are what you eat. What you put on your lips, you eat,"" she says. Bite Beauty was launched in 2012 in partnership with Sephora, the France-based chain of global cosmetics stores which began selling the products in its outlets. The firm also has ""lip labs"", where people custom-make their own lipstick. Bite's Lip Labs are where people can custom-make their lipstick Karen Grant, a beauty industry analyst at market research firm The NPD Group, says Sephora is a ""great incubator"" for small businesses. Bite's launch was master class in getting it right, she says, praising the sleek and edgy product design. Bite's success did not come without hurdles, however, says Ms Langmuir. The Canadian beauty entrepreneur, born and raised near Toronto, hit two early roadblocks. Major cosmetics production facilities said they could not produce formulas without at least some synthetic ingredients - a deal-breaker for Ms Langmuir. So she built a lipstick factory in Toronto, where the products are still handmade. The first chemist that Ms Langmuir hired almost torpedoed the project by quitting without notice shortly before the company had to show early formulas to Sephora. Ms Langmuir, who sold Avon as a teenager and later worked as a cosmetics consultant for several companies, including Anthropologie and Urban Outfitters, had some experience creating formulas. So she ""made a bunch of things in the lab"" and headed off to the Sephora meeting, telling them: ""You don't want to get too attached to the formula, but this is where we are heading."" She eventually recruited a former Estee Lauder chemist. Products displayed in the Bite Lip Lab Ms Langmuir says she and her 140 Bite staff are used to handling challenges. ""We find humour in them, we find a way to figure them out. We've got good perspective on what we do next,"" she says. ""It's a good sign when there are significant challenges."" Bite was not her first entrepreneurial challenge. Almost 20 years ago, she developed an organic face oil, but it never caught on with consumers. She also launched a perfume shop that was flooded with sewage water on its first day. She describes herself as ""a weeble-wobble"" toy that bounces back after being knocked down. ""There's always another way,"" she says. The idea for Bite came from a gut feeling that there was an underserved market for all-natural cosmetics with an edgy, contemporary style. In the spring of 2013, Bite held a promotional pop-up shop in a Toronto Sephora store. She was given a window space to set up lab equipment and showcase how Bite's small batches of handmade lipsticks were made. Bite's production lab in Toronto People were captivated. Three weeks later she leased a shop in the SoHo district of Manhattan to set up the inaugural Bite Lip Lab, where people could create shades on the spot, and select the finish and scent within half an hour. There are now four Lip Labs in the US and Canada, and plans to open more in Los Angeles and other cities. The Lip Labs have placed Bite at the forefront of what the industry considers a growing trend - bespoke beauty - and will be ""a crucial, fundamental part of our growth,"" Ms Langmuir says. Having clients who like to personalise products means Ms Langmuir can tap into the latest trends in the fast-moving cosmetics marketplace. ""For us, we learn about our clients, we learn about trends, we have lots of 'aha moments' where things that are not even on my radar (come up),"" she says. MoreThe Bossfeatures, which every week profile a different business leader from around the world: The millionaire boss who admits he had a lot of luck The man who built a $1bn firm in his basement How one man built a global hospitality empire The 'diva of divorce' for the world's super rich The snacks boss with an appetite for success A year after launching the SoHo Lip Lab, Bite was bought by Kendo, which, like Sephora, is part of the French multinational luxury goods conglomerate Louis Vuitton Moet Hennessy. The sale price has not been disclosed. However, Ms Langmuir remains in day-to-day control as chief creative officer, and the products are still handmade in Toronto, in the community where her kids go to school. The purchase gave Bite the resources to scale-up the business, and Ms Langmuir has no regrets about selling. It will enable the company to ""grow ten times as big"", she says. ""I get to focus on the creative stuff, and that's the icing."" The search for the perfect red The challenge is to stay relevant in a industry where trends never stop changing - sometimes very quickly. She grabs a sample lipstick from her desk and swipes a bright white pearlescent colour on her hand. ""This is like, whoo! I toned that one down because it was a little too crazy. It's finding that balance,"" she says. NPD Group's Karen Grant says Bite must avoid just churning out more products to make scale. ""A brand can't get too detached or too comfortable,"" she says. Ms Langmuir knows that walking this tightrope will determine how relevant the company will be in 10 or 20 years. ""It's finding the balance between core and things that are new and exciting,"" she says.

"Mr Kushner appears before the Senate on Monday and the House on Tuesday President Donald Trump's son-in-law has said neither he nor anyone in the Trump campaign team colluded with Russian officials over the US election. Jared Kushner said he had no improper contacts and did not rely on Russian funds to finance business activities. Mr Kushner released his opening statement ahead of giving testimony before a Senate panel on Monday. The Senate, the House and a special counsel are all investigating Russian interference in the election. Mr Kushner, 36, is a senior adviser to the president and was in charge of the Trump campaign's digital strategy. He is married to Mr Trump's daughter, Ivanka. Mr Kushner, who keeps a very low media profile, was due to attend a closed-door session on Monday before the Senate Intelligence Committee, and then appear before the House version on Tuesday. Jared Kushner's full 11-page statement,external Russia: The 'cloud' over the Trump White House How Trump's Russia trouble unfolded In the statement,externalto both congressional committees he released on Monday, he says: ""I did not collude, nor know of anyone else in the campaign who colluded, with any foreign government."" ""With respect to my contacts with Russia or Russian representatives during the campaign, there were hardly any,"" he says. At the end of the statement he speaks of ""perhaps four contacts with Russian representatives"" both during the campaign and after. He does refer to a meeting with Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya in June last year. She had allegedly promised damaging material on Hillary Clinton. Mr Kushner said he arrived late at the meeting, realised little of note was being discussed and that it was ""time not well-spent"". This video can not be played The BBC's Sarah Rainsford tries to get Russian pop star Emin Agalarov to comment on his links to Donald Trump. He said: ""I actually emailed an assistant from the meeting after I had been there for 10 or so minutes and wrote 'Can u pls call me on my cell? Need excuse to get out of meeting'."" Where Trump is seen as saviour Is Kushner the most powerful 36-year-old in the world? Jared Kushner: The son-in-law with Donald Trump's ear Mr Trump Jr said former campaign chief Paul Manafort was also at the meeting and that no compromising material on Mrs Clinton was provided. Anthony Zurcher, BBC North America reporter In his Senate testimony Jared Kushner says he has nothing to hide and is ""happy"" to share information with those investigating possible Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential campaign. His written statement, however, is an exercise in caution and lawyerly discretion. He addresses only the controversies already in the public sphere, then offers his explanation for why they are no big deal. He receives hundreds of emails a day and didn't read his brother-in-law's forwarded message that said the Russian government wanted to help the Trump campaign. Reports of an effort to set up back-channel communications with Russia after the election were a halted effort to get information about Syria from Russian generals. He met with an influential Russian banker because the Russian ambassador - whose name he couldn't initially remember - was so persistent. The incomplete security form was the result of a ""miscommunication"" with an assistant who submitted it too soon. Beyond that, there are no new revelations; no new disclosures. If what's already out is all there is, Mr Kushner and his lawyers have done their best to defuse the bombs. When walking in a minefield, it's the ones you don't know about that pose the greatest risk. One matter on which Mr Kushner may face a grilling is his security clearance declaration, as he accepts he failed initially to reveal his contacts with Russians. He says the first form, a ""rough draft that still had many omissions"", was filed by an assistant in error on 18 January and that declarations on his foreign contacts, not just with Russians, were added over the next six months ""in the normal course"". Ambassador Sergei Kislyak(above). Brief meeting of ""pleasantries"" in April 2016 in Washington. Meeting at Trump Tower on 1 December. Discussed Syria and trying to improve relations. Mr Kushner insists he did not suggest a ""secret back channel"" for communication or discuss sanctions. Mr Kislyak's term ended on Saturday Sergei Gorkov. Mr Kushner says he met the banker on 12 December at the request of Mr Kislyak, who presented him as a man with direct links to President Vladimir Putin. Mr Kushner insists he did not discuss sanctions, business interests or specific policy issues and has had no contacts with him since Guccifer400. Mr Kushner says he received a ""random email"" trying to extort 52 bitcoins in exchange for not publishing Mr Trump's tax details. Mr Kushner says he ignored the email Natalia Veselnitskaya. Mr Kushner said he had not spoken to the lawyer before or since the June 2016 meeting and had forgotten about it until an email exchange involving President Trump's son, Donald Jr, came to light last month. He says: ""No part of the meeting I attended included anything about the campaign, there was no follow up to the meeting that I am aware of, I do not recall how many people were there (or their names), and I have no knowledge of any documents being offered or accepted."" Mr Kushner was not expected to invoke his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination at the Congress meetings. In his statement, he says: ""I am happy to share information with the investigating bodies. I have shown today that I am willing to do so and will continue to co-operate as I have nothing to hide."" His statement concludes: ""Hopefully, this puts these matters to rest."" Mr Kushner was also not expected to be under oath on Monday. However, what he says could be used against him at a later date and may well be passed to the special counsel, Robert Mueller, to help his investigation. Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the House intelligence panel, said: ""There's a lot we want to know. We have a lot of ground to cover."" Mr Trump Jr and Mr Manafort had been scheduled to appear before Congress on Wednesday to testify but that has been delayed indefinitely as lawyers negotiate on the documentation and information to be discussed. President Trump has repeatedly denied any collusion with Russia. He continued his tirade against the investigation process on Sunday, tweeting: ""As the phony Russian Witch Hunt continues, two groups are laughing at this excuse for a lost election taking hold, Democrats and Russians!""

"The child caught the infection from its mother around the time of birth A nine-year-old infected with HIV at birth has spent most of their life without needing any treatment, say doctors in South Africa. The child, whose identity is being protected, was given a burst of treatment shortly after birth. They have since been off drugs for eight-and-a-half years without symptoms or signs of active virus. The family is said to be ""really delighted"". Most people need treatment every day to prevent HIV destroying the immune system and causing Aids. Understanding how the child is protected could lead to new drugs or a vaccine for stopping HIV. The child caught the infection from their mother around the time of birth in 2007. They had very high levels of HIV in the blood. Early antiretroviral therapy was not standard practice at the time, but was given to the child from nine weeks old as part of a clinical trial. Levels of the virus became undetectable, treatment was stopped after 40 weeks and unlike anybody else on the study - the virus has not returned. Early therapy which attacks the virus before it has a chance to fully establish itself has been implicated in child ""cure"" cases twice before. The ""Mississippi Baby"" was put on treatmentwithin 30 hours of birth and went 27 months without treatment before HIV re-emerged in her blood. There was also a case in France with a patient who has now gone more than 11 years without drugs. Dr Avy Violari, the head of paediatric research at the Perinal HIV Research Unit in Johannesburg, said: ""We don't believe that antiretroviral therapy alone can lead to remission. ""We don't really know what's the reason why this child has achieved remission - we believe it's either genetic or immune system-related."" Some people are naturally better at dealing with an HIV infection - so-called ""elite controllers"". However, whatever the child has is different to anything that has been seen before. Replicating it as a new form of therapy - a drug, antibody or vaccine - would have the potential to help other patients. It is worth noting that while there is no active HIV in the child's body, the virus has been detected in the child's immune cells. HIV can hide inside them - called latent HIV - for long periods of time, so there is still a danger the child could need drug treatment in the future. The team in Johannesburg performed the study alongside the UK's MRC Clinical Trials Unit. Prof Diana Gibb, who is based in London, told the BBC News website: ""It captures the imagination because you've got a virtual cure and it is exciting to see cases like this. ""But it is important to remember it is one child. Injections are 'next revolution' in HIV, study finds Hunt for HIV cure turns to cancer drugs Aids deaths halve as more get drugs ""HIV is still a massive problem around the world and we mustn't put all our eyes on to one phenomenon like this, as opposed to looking at the bigger issues for Africa."" Worldwide, 36.7 million people are living with HIV and only 53% of them are receiving antiretroviral therapy. Dr Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said: ""Further study is needed to learn how to induce long-term HIV remission in infected babies. ""However, this new case strengthens our hope that by treating HIV-infected children for a brief period beginning in infancy, we may be able to spare them the burden of lifelong therapy and the health consequences of long-term immune activation typically associated with HIV disease.""

"Central parts of Schaffhausen have been sealed off by police Police are hunting for a man who attacked five people with a chainsaw in the Swiss town of Schaffhausen. Franz Wrousis is alleged to have launched his assault at a health insurance office shortly after 10:30 local time (08:30 GMT). The attack sparked a manhunt involving more than 100 officers from both Switzerland and Germany. Police say the 51-year-old, who lives in the woods, is dangerous and believed to be still armed with the chainsaw. His exact motives are still not clear, but police Major Ravi Landolt told a news conference: ""This is not an attack against a hypothetical person. This is clearly against people from the insurer."" Swiss police are searching for this man Mr Wrousis, who has two previous convictions for weapons offences, is reported to have entered the offices in Schaffhausen on Monday morning. He then allegedly attacked a number of people working in the branch of health insurance company CSS. At least one employee was left with serious injuries, but is now out of danger. On Monday afternoon, police said the vehicle he was believed to be driving - a white Volkswagen - had been found, but Mr Wrousis remained at large. People living near the woods just outside the city confirmed to Switzerland's20 Minuten,external(in German) that Mr Wrousis had been living in the area for at least a couple of weeks. One resident told the news site they had reported him to police on two occasions after he verbally attacked them. Schaffhausen is the capital of the Swiss canton of the same name.

"Charity donation websites, often used to support victims of violence, are being employed by a number of Westerners to finance their personal war efforts. Fighting continues in eastern Ukraine, as pro-Russian separatists battle Ukrainian government forces. More than 10,000 people have died since the conflict erupted in April 2014, andrecently a rebel leader declared a state called ""Malorossiya"" (Little Russia) in Donetsk. Among the separatists are a number of Westerners, drawn to the country by the conflict and financing their adventures using charity crowdfunding websites - sometimes in apparent violation of website rules and Ukrainian laws. One of the most prominent is Russell Bentley, a Texas native who describes himself as a pro-Russian communist. When the conflict started, Bentley was working as an ordinary lumberjack in Austin. Yet by December 2014 he had reached the epicentre of the conflict - armed with a rocket propelled grenade launcher and tasked with repelling Ukrainian forces at Donetsk airport, a key strategic position. Ukraine conflict: Why is east hit by conflict? Ukraine crisis: What is Novorossiya role? Ukraine conflict: Russia rejects new Donetsk rebel 'state' From the start, Bentley has relied on crowdfunding websites to finance his exploits. Crowdfunding websites such as GoFundMe, JustGiving and Indiegogo are typically used for charitable purposes - including to raise money for the victims of tragedies. People can donate money in exchange for small gifts or 'perks'. For example, the Manchester Evening Newsraised over Â£2.5 million,externalthrough JustGiving for the families of those killed and injured in the recent Manchester terror attack in the UK. However, Bentley and others have been using these crowdfunding websites to fund their own personal war efforts in Ukraine. In November 2014, Bentley launched a GoFundMe page to finance a ""fact finding mission"" to Donbas, the conflict zone that includes the eastern Ukrainian regions of Donetsk and Luhansk. Bentley raised $2,000 and hasn't returned to the United States since. After spending six months fighting with separatists on the front line, Bentley was reassigned and now works, he says, as an ""information warrior"" - producing regular pro-separatist propaganda videos on the Ukrainian war. Bentley is affiliated with the Essence of Time movement - a Russia-based communist group which seeks to create ""USSR 2.0"", involving the break-up of Ukraine. Bentley's videos are hosted on the group's YouTube page, which has 25,000 subscribers. In the videos, Bentley encourages fellow Americans to join him in eastern Ukraine. One of his recommendations is for volunteers to raise money via crowdfunding before they travel. Bentley states in one video: ""Don't show up here brokeâ¦ You can do a crowd fundraiser - a GoFundMe or an Indiegogo. Say you're coming here to help. Say you're coming here to find the truth. Don't say you're coming here to fight."" Russell Bentley has spent nearly three years in Donbass after crowdfunding his initial journey to Ukraine But most crowdfunding websites - includingGoFundMe,externalandIndiegogo,external- strictly prohibit campaigns designed to raise money for violent purposes. Despite the site's rules, Bentley's most recent campaign, hosted on Indiegogo, features a video of him touring the conflict areas with an automatic weapon - at one point firing at a Ukrainian military drone. He talks about his time on the front line, while encouraging armed resistance against ""Ukrainian Nazis"". Bentley's current crowdfunding effort is raising funds to publish a self-authored book about his war experiences in Donbas. The Texan offers military shoulder patches and T-shirts for donations of between $100 and $999. Before BBC Trending contacted Indiegogo about Bentley's campaign, ""secret"" perks were offered for larger donations. These perks could only be revealed by emailing Bentley directly, though he did disclose that a donation of $15,000 would have earned contributors a tour of Odessa and Kiev ""after we liberate them"". Bentley is asking for a minimum of $9,000 for the book project, and at the time of writing has raised more than half that amount. BBC Trending approached Bentley for an interview and he declined to talk to us, but after contacting him and Indiegogo, all mention of the secret perks on his campaign have now been removed. Bentley broadcasts his videos on YouTube via Essence of Time, a communist group Bentley isn't a one-off. Other Westerners have been using online crowdfunding to finance their activities in eastern Ukraine since the conflict started. Among them is 38-year-old Graham Phillips from Nottingham in the UK. Since November 2013, Phillips has been covering the conflict, broadcasting amateur videos from Donbas, often in the midst of tearing bullets and toppling buildings. His daredevil style has drawn the attention of audiences, and he boasts 86,000 subscribers on YouTube. From 2014 to 2015, Phillips was employed by Zvezda - a media channel run by the Russian Ministry of Defence, and he alsofreelanced for the state-operated TV channel RT. Phillips is highly critical of the Ukrainian government and appears to back the break-up of the country. Speaking on camera to Bentley in September 2015, Phillips accuses the Ukrainian government of ""lies and propaganda"", before adding: ""I absolutely believe that we'll win in the end."" Since May 2014, Phillips has been forbidden from entering Ukraine, on the grounds of ""national security"". The Ukrainian government even took the unusual step of issuing anopen letter,externalto UK authorities, condemning Phillips' actions. Phillips says that he's an independent journalist and claims that he has financed his activities entirely through crowdfunding from January 2016 onwards - although existing records indicate he's raised less than Â£7,500 through crowdfunding campaigns during that time. Graham Phillips is currently crowdfunding for a new period of reporting in eastern Europe At least three of his campaigns have been created to fund work in Donbas, and despite being banned from the country, he's travelled to the region frequently since May 2014. On his blog, he says he enters the region via Russia, although travelling to the area via separatist controlled border crossings iscurrently illegal under Ukrainian law,external. Because of his actions, the crowdfunding website JustGiving removed one of Phillips' appeals in July 2015. After the company was notified that Phillips was unable to legally re-enter the region, JustGiving refused to release the Â£2,000 that Phillips had raised through his campaign. Although Phillips also declined to speak to BBC Trending, he has disputed the company's actions, and his campaigns remain active on Indiegogo. Unlike Bentley, Phillips has not engaged in combat, although he has beenfilmed,externalnavigating a drone with the help of soldiers in Donbas and hasinterviewed,externalUkrainian prisoners of war. Graham Phillips on Twitter Phillips is not the only Brit who has travelled to the Ukraine conflict region. Earlier this month, Benjamin Stimson, from Manchester in the UK, wassentencedby Manchester Crown Court to five years and four months in prison for assisting separatist forces in Donbass. Phillips works with a third pro-separatist video maker - American-born Patrick Lancaster. Lancaster also describes himself as an independent journalist, and says his work is entirely funded through crowdfunding. Despite this, he seems to have raised less than $6,500 in the past eight months. Lancaster's videos have been featured by mainstream media outlets and he has contributed toThe Telegraph,externaland Sky News. However, some of his reporting has been openly hostile towards Ukraine and the West.Speaking,externalon RT in February 2015, Lancaster said that the Ukraine's current president, Petro Poroshenko, is an enemy of the people. In November 2016, Lancaster set up an Indiegogocampaign,externalto raise $2,000 for his reporting in eastern Ukraine. Donation incentives included a guided trip from Russia into the battle zone, which would have violated the Ukrainian border crossing law, although there's no evidence that anyone took up the offer. Lancaster recently removed this perk, after BBC Trending contacted both him and Indiegogo. On the same crowdfunding page, Lancaster offered military souvenirs from the Ukrainian war, including pieces of shrapnel or rubble from Donetsk airport. Yet, in an email to Trending, Lancaster distanced himself from Bentley, and said that he is not a fighter or an activist in the conflict. Indiegogo released a statement on the campaigns of Bentley, Phillips and Lancaster, telling Trending: ""Indiegogo's Trust and Safety team has reviewed these campaigns in detail and has taken steps to ensure they comply with our terms of use.""

"Meat substitute company Quorn Foods says it has seen ""unprecedented"" global growth in the first half of this year, with sales up 19% worldwide. The firm says it is benefiting from the rise of the ""flexitarian"" diet. This means more people have been reducing meat consumption in favour of more sustainable protein sources. As a result, it is investing Â£150m to double production at its main plant in Teesside and expects to create 300 new jobs there in the next five years. ""We are proud to be contributing to the UK's export drive and to be investing in a British innovation that is vital to addressing the future need for protein across a growing global population,"" said Quorn chief executive Kevin Brennan. ""Our growth will continue as expected, regardless of the Brexit deal that is reached. ""In fact, today's investment is indicative of our confidence in becoming a billion-dollar brand in the next 10 years."" The firm, which has been owned by Monde Nissin of the Philippines since 2015, says it made a pre-tax operating profit of Â£13.7m in the first six months of 2017. Quorn, a meat substitute made from fungus, is sold on its own for use in recipes at home or in ready meals and products that mimic items such as burgers and sausages. It is available in 15 countries.

"Consumers in the UK could save billions of pounds thanks to major changes in the way electricity is made, used and stored, the government has said. New rules will make it easier for people to generate their own power with solar panels, store it in batteries and sell it to the National Grid. If they work, consumers will save Â£17bn to Â£40bn by 2050, according to the government and energy regulator Ofgem. The rules are due to come into effect over the next year. They will reduce costs for someone who allows their washing machine to be turned on by the internet to maximise use of cheap solar power on a sunny afternoon. And they will even support people who agree to have their freezers switched off for a few minutes to smooth demand at peak times. They'll also benefit a business that allows its air-conditioning to be turned down briefly to help balance a spell of peak energy demand on the National Grid. Among the first to gain from the rule changes will be people with solar panels and battery storage. At the moment they are charged tariffs when they import electricity into their home or export it back to the grid. The government has realised that this rule must change because it deters people from using power more flexibly in a way that will benefit everyone. How a 'smarter' power system might affect you World's first floating wind farm emerges Thanks to improvements in digital technology, battery storage and renewables, these innovations in flexibility are already under way with millions of people across the UK generating and storing electricity. The new rules have been designed to cash in on this. The government will set up a ""battery institute"" to fund firms seeking major breakthroughs in battery research and development. Its critics say it has been slow to support the burgeoning battery industry - and has allowed South Korea, Japan and China to take a lead. The tiny energy savings of millions of people and firms will be pulled together into packages by traders, who will offer substantial chunks of energy saving to the National Grid at the click of a computer. Under the new system you should be able to tell your machine to do the washing when the sun comes out, to take advantage of solar power So instead of predicting peak demand then building power stations to meet it, energy managers will be able to trade in Negawatts - negative electricity. In a speech made in Birmingham, Business Secretary Greg Clark outlined further a Â£246m investment in the UK's industrial strategy, with energy at its heart. He gave details of a competition for innovation in battery technology, which he says will help make the UK a world leader in battery design and manufacture. Nicola Shaw, executive director of National Grid,previously told BBC Newsthat between 30% and 50% of fluctuations on the grid could be smoothed by households and businesses adjusting their demand at peak times. ""We are at a moment of real change in the energy industry,"" she said. ""From an historic perspective, we created energy in big generating organisations that sent power to houses and their businesses. ""Now we are producing energy in those places - mostly with solar power."" An Ofgem source told BBC News the current rules on trading energy are not fit for the digital age because they often discourage people using energy flexibly. The rules were made before the digital revolution and before the boom in variable renewable energy. Industry figures talk about the seismic change that's sweeping them along. At a recent UK conference, energy managers were asked which of them could foresee the shape of the industry in a decade; only half a dozen people raised their hands. Some will urge a degree of caution amongst the enthusiasm: the more the energy industry embraces the digital age, the more vulnerable it will be to hacking. Recent reports suggest,externalthat Russian hackers may already have tried to compromise the system. Ofgem says the new rules will put measures in place to combat interference.

"This video can not be played Migrant deaths: How one Texas county is struggling to cope Police in the US state of Texas have arrested a truck driver whose vehicle was found in a Walmart car park with dozens of people in the back of it. Nine men had died inside, and 28 others, including children, were taken to hospital. They were inside the trailer in San Antonio without access to air conditioning or water while outside temperatures hit 38C (100F). Police say they believe the incident is linked to people smuggling. The truck's driver, named by authorities as James Mathew Bradley Jr, 60, of Clearwater, Florida, is expected to appear in court later. Video footage from the store reportedly showed a number of vehicles arriving to pick up some of the survivors. Several others may have managed to escape on foot into the woods nearby. One person found in the woods was being treated, local officials said. Mexico's government said it was working closely with US authorities to identify the nationalities of the victims. San Antonio is a few hours' drive from the border with Mexico, and the US immigration department is trying to establish the victims' legal status. San Antonio Mayor Ron Nirenberg told the BBC that caring for the victims was the authorities' first aim. ""Our most important focus right now is to deliver compassionate care,"" he said. ""You know our first responders immediately were on the scene, delivering first aid, transporting - sometimes by air - critical condition patients to local hospitals, and trying to prevent more loss of life than what had already occurred."" ""We are working with authorities, we are working with... witnesses to understand the magnitude of these crimes. ""But in this case, where we are witnesses to a human tragedy in our city, our first response and our response as local officials is to render aid."" Eight people were found to be dead at the scene while another died in hospital, immigration officials said. This video can not be played Police Chief William McManus and Fire Chief Charles Hood told reporters about the discovery Officials were brought to the trailer by a man who had approached an employee of the Walmart and asked for water. The driver would be charged in connection with the ""horrible tragedy"", said San Antonio police chief William McManusin a press briefing,external. He said the people ranged from school age to in their 30s. Local fire chief Charles Hood said the survivors had heart rates of over 130 beats per minute and were very hot to touch. In addition to the 20 people in a critical condition, eight others were taken to hospital in a less severe state. The fire chief confirmed at least two of the victims were school-age children. Their condition is not clear. ""We're very fortunate that there weren't 38 of these people who were all locked inside this vehicle dead,"" he added. The truck was towed away from the scene hours after the discovery The US attorney for the Western District of Texas, Richard Durbin, said the authorities were working to identify those responsible for the incident. ""These people were helpless in the hands of their transporters. Imagine their suffering, trapped in a stifling trailer in 100-plus degree heat,"" he said in a statement. They were victims of ""ruthless human smugglers indifferent to the wellbeing of their fragile cargo"", he added. Thirty-three migrants were found in a trailer in the same part of Texas earlier this month Experts say people smuggling is a serious issue in southern Texas, and there have been a number of similar cases in the area just in this past month. On 7 July, US Border Patrol agents found 72 undocumented immigrants from Central American countrieslocked inside a trailer,external""with no means of escape"".

On the second day of its cyber crime series, thei paper,externalleads on a report that the computer systems of dozens of public sector organisations - from hospitals and councils to museums and watchdogs - have been attacked more than 400 times in the last three years. It says cyber criminals have been seeking to extort money, cause disruption or extract data. An investigation by the paper has found that the vast majority of the incidents have not previously been made public - and many are not being reported to the police. According to theGuardian's,externalmain story, doctors are warning that almost 63,000 people in England will die over the next five years from liver problems linked to heavy drinking, unless ministers tackle the scourge of cheap alcohol. It says senior members of the medical profession and health charities are urging the government to bring in minimum unit pricing and crack down on drink advertising to avert what they claim is a public health crisis of liver disease deaths. Get news from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning,external England's dramatic victory over India in the Women's Cricket World Cup final is reported on many front pages - as well as the sports pages. TheTimes,externalsays women have not always been made to feel welcome at Lord's - female members were permitted to enter the pavilion only in 1999. But in front of more than 26,000 paying spectators on Sunday, there was a sense that women's cricket had come of age. TheFinancial Times,externalsays the tournament has marked a breakthrough for the women's game, with extensive media coverage and avid crowds. Increasingly - theDaily Telegraph,externalsays - spectators are tuning in to women's sport to find skill and spectacle every bit the equal of the men's game. Meanwhile, theTelegraph,externalsays it can disclose that the BBC is planning to take men off radio and television programmes and replace them with women in an attempt to close the gender pay gap. Quoting ""insiders"", the paper reports that the BBC will seek to boost women's pay by giving them plum jobs when contracts of male presenters come up for renewal. With the budget for BBC talent constrained by strict spending controls, the corporation can only increase women's pay by cutting that of men, it adds.

"It sounded like cannon fire - pirates, probably. The British East India Company's ship Benares was docked at Makassar, on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi. Its commander gave the order to set sail and hunt them down. Three days later, the crew still hadn't found any pirates. What they had actually heard was the eruption of a volcano called Mount Tambora. A cocktail of toxic gas and liquefied rock roared down the volcano's slopes at the speed of a hurricane, killing thousands. Mount Tambora was left 4,000ft (1,220m) shorter. The year was 1815. Slowly, a vast cloud of volcanic ash drifted across the northern hemisphere, blocking the Sun. In Europe, 1816 became ""the year without a summer"". Crops failed. Desperate people ate rats, cats and grass. In the German town of Darmstadt, the suffering made a deep impression on a 13-year-old boy. Justus von Liebig loved helping out in his father's workshop, concocting pigments, paints and polishes. Liebig grew up to be a brilliant chemist, driven by the desire to help prevent hunger. He did some of the earliest research into fertilisers. He pioneered nutritional science and invented beef extract. He invented something else, too: infant formula. 50 Things That Made the Modern Economyhighlights the inventions, ideas and innovations that helped create the economic world. It is broadcast on the BBC World Service. You can findmore information about the programme's sourcesandlisten onlineorsubscribe to the programme podcast. Launched in 1865, Liebig's Soluble Food for Babies was a powder comprising cow's milk, wheat flour, malt flour and potassium bicarbonate. It was the first commercial substitute for breast milk to come from rigorous scientific study. As Liebig knew, not every baby has a mother who can breastfeed. Justus von Liebig was inspired by the hunger he witnessed while a young man Indeed, not every baby has a mother: before modern medicine, about one in 100 childbirths killed the mother. It's little better in the poorest countries today. Some mothers can't make enough milk - the figures are disputed, but could be as high as one in 20. What happened to those kids before formula? Parents who could afford it employed wet-nurses - a respectable profession for the working girl, and an early casualty of Liebig's invention. Some used a goat or donkey. Many gave their infants ""pap"", a bread-and-water mush, from hard-to-clean receptacles that must have teemed with bacteria. No wonder death rates were high: in the early 1800s, only two in three babies who weren't breastfed lived to see their first birthday. Liebig's formula hit the market at a propitious time. Germ theory was increasingly well understood, and the rubber teat had just been invented. The appeal of formula quickly spread beyond women who couldn't breastfeed. Liebig's Soluble Food for Babies democratised a lifestyle choice that had previously been open only to the well-to-do. It's a choice that now shapes the modern workplace. For many new mothers who want - or need - to get back to work, formula is a godsend. And women are right to worry that taking time out might damage their careers. Recently, economists studied the experiences of the high-powered men and women emerging from Chicago University's MBA programme and entering the worlds of consulting and high finance. At first, the women had similar experiences to the men - but over a time, a huge gap in earnings opened up. The critical moment? Motherhood. Women took time off, and employers paid them less in response. Ironically, the men were more likely than the women to have children. They just didn't change their working patterns. Mark Zuckerberg is one of the few high-profile chief executives to take paternity leave There are biological and cultural reasons why women are more likely than men to take time off when they start families. We can't change the fact that only women have wombs, but we can try to change workplace culture. More governments are following Scandinavia's lead by giving fathers the legal right to take time off.  More leaders -such as Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg- are setting an example by taking it. And formula milk makes it a whole lot easier for Dad to take over while Mum gets back to work. There is, of course, the breast-pump option. But for some, it's more of an effort than formula. Do mums really need breastfeeding help from technology? Studies show that the less time mothers have off work, the less likely they are to persevere with breastfeeding. That's hardly surprising. There's just one problem. Evolution has had thousands of generations to optimise the recipe for breast milk. And formula doesn't quite match it, especially in the developing world, where clean water and sterilised equipment is not always available. A series of articles published by the medical journal the Lancet in 2016,externallists the risks. Formula-fed infants get sick more often than breastfed children, leading to costs for medical treatment, and parents taking time off work. Researchers believe breastfeeding could help prevent more than 800,000 child deaths a year It's thought that nearly half of all diarrhoea episodes and a third of all respiratory infections could be prevented by breastfeeding. That, combined with the risk of using formula in less than ideal circumstances, can even lead to deaths. According to the Lancet's analysis of more than 1,300 studies,external, breastfeeding could prevent about 800,000 child deaths a year. Justus von Liebig wanted to save lives. He would be horrified. Of course, in rich countries, contaminated milk and water are far less of a concern. But formula has another, less obvious economic cost. Again, according to the Lancet, there is evidence that breastfed babies grow up with slightly higher IQs - about three points, when you control as best you can for other factors. What might be the benefit of making a whole generation of children just that little bit more clever? The Lancet calculated it to be about $300bn (Â£232bn) a year,external. That's several times the value of the global formula market. Consequently, many governments try to promote breastfeeding. But nobody makes a quick profit from that. Selling formula, on the other hand, can be lucrative. The tiny pill which gave birth to an economic revolution TV dinners: The hidden cost of the processed food revolution How Ikea's Billy bookcase took over the world Grace Hopper's compiler: Computing's hidden hero Which have you seen more of recently: public service announcements about breastfeeding, or formula ads? Liebig himself never claimed that his Soluble Food for Babies was better than breast milk: he simply said he'd made it as nutritionally similar as possible. But he quickly inspired imitators who weren't so scrupulous. By the 1890s, adverts for formula routinely portrayed it as state-of-the-art. Meanwhile, paediatricians were starting to notice higher rates of scurvy and rickets among the offspring of mothers whom the advertising swayed. The controversy peaked in 1974, when the campaigning groupWar on Want published a pamphlet called The Baby Killer,externalabout how Nestle marked and sold infant formula in Africa.Nestle boycotts lasted years. By 1981, there was a World Health Organization (WHO)International Code of Marketing Breast-milk Substitutes,external, whichNestle says it drew on to devise its own marketing code,external, the first manufacturer to do so. But the WHO code is not hard law, and many campaigners argue that it is still widely flouted. What if there was a way to get the best of all worlds: equal career breaks for mothers and fathers, and breast milk for infants, without the faff of breast pumps? Perhaps there is - if you don't mind taking market forces to their logical conclusion. Breast milk can be frozen and used at a later date In Utah, there's a company called Ambrosia Labs. Its business model? Pay mothers around the world to express breast milk, screen it for quality, and sell it on to American mothers. Milk is pricey - over $100 (Â£77) a litre (1.75 pints). But that could come down with scale - and maybe formula could be taxed, to fund a breast-milk market subsidy. Not everyone likes this idea. Indeed, the government in Cambodia, where Ambrosia used to operate,has banned the export of breast milk. Still, more than 150 years after Justus von Liebig sounded the death knell for wet nursing as a profession, perhaps the global supply chain could find a way to bring it back.

"The IMF's forecast for UK growth in 2018 is unchanged The UK and US economies will expand more slowly in 2017 than previously predicted, according to the International Monetary Fund (IMF). It said ""weaker-than-expected activity"" in the first three months of the year meant the UK would grow by 1.7%, compared with an earlier 2% forecast. The IMF also revised down its US growth forecast from 2.3% to 2.1%. However, its overall global economic predictions - of 3.5% growth in 2017 and 3.6% in 2018 - remain unchanged. The UK growth forecast for 2018 remains unchanged at 1.5%, but US growth for next year is now predicted to come in at 2.1%, instead of the 2.5% previously forecast. In its latest World Economic Outlook, the IMF said the ""pick-up in global growth"" that it had anticipated in its previous survey in April remained ""on track"". But it added that while the global growth projection was unchanged that masked ""somewhat different contributions at the country level"". The IMF's chief economist, Maurice Obstfeld, told the BBC that the organisation was watching closely the impact of Brexit on the UK's future economic health. ""We have long predicted that Brexit would have some negative long-term effects, but in the case of this year's forecast [downgrade] we are basing it purely on the observation of data for the first part of this year which has been weaker than expected. ""Our projections for long-term British growth are actually based on a pretty optimistic assessment of how the negotiations are likely to turn out, so if things are worse than that it will turn out to be correspondingly worse for the British economy."" This video can not be played The IMF has warned on the Today programme that Brexit will be a ""mild negative"" to the British economy A UK Treasury spokesperson said the IMF forecast underlined why the government's plans to increase productivity and get ""the very best deal with the EU"" after Brexit were ""vitally important"". ""Employment is at a record high and the deficit is down by three quarters, showing that the fundamentals of our economy are strong,"" they added. Economists warned that IMF forecasts were not always right. ""The IMF, a multi-lateral institution, takes a step back and looks at a broad range of activities across the world, but they do sometimes get things wrong and we wouldn't want to put too much emphasis on what's been released today,"" said Lucy O'Carroll, chief economist of Aberdeen Asset Management. The downgrade in the UK's forecast reflects the weak start to the year. The economy grew by 0.2% in the first three months.  That is all we get by way of explanation from the IMF. It is a short report - just seven pages - and it updates the IMF's assessment for the whole world economy so there isn't much space to spell it out. The IMF is well known, some would say notorious, for warning before last year's referendum of the adverse economic consequences of leaving the European Union. Do the agency's economists think that the downgrade reflects evidence suggesting that they were right? The report doesn't say.  The IMF's chief economist told the BBC that the revision was based purely on the weakness at the start of the year. We will get a bit of hard evidence on how justified the downgrade was or was not later this week, when the Office for National Statistics publishes its first estimate of economic growth in the second quarter of the year. The IMF said that the main factor behind its downward revision for US growth in 2018 was ""the assumption that fiscal policy will be less expansionary than previously assumed, given the uncertainty about the timing and nature of US fiscal policy changes"". ""Market expectations of fiscal stimulus have also receded."" President Donald Trump's administration had been widely expected to pursue policies including tax cuts and infrastructure investment to try to boost the US economy. However, the chances of the administration being able to push through these policies now appears less likely. The eurozone is seeing ""stronger momentum"", the IMF said The IMF's outlook for several eurozone economies was brighter than initially thought, with countries including France, Germany, Italy and Spain seeing growth forecasts revised up. The biggest eurozone revisions were for the Spanish and Italian economies. Spain is now forecast to grow 3.1% this year, up from the previous prediction of 2.6%. Italy's 2017 growth forecast has risen from 0.8% to 1.3%. The euro area as a whole is expected to grow by 1.9% this year, up from 1.7%. The IMF said first-quarter growth in many of those countries was better than expected, and that there was evidence of ""stronger momentum in domestic demand than previously anticipated"". China's growth projections have also been revised up, reflecting, the Fund says, ""a strong first quarter of 2017 and expectations of continued fiscal support"". Its 2017 forecast has risen from 6.6% to 6.7%, while growth in 2018 is now expected to be 6.4% instead of 6.2%. The IMF hailed China's ""policy easing and supply-side reforms"", including efforts to reduce excess capacity in the industrial sector.

"South West Trains is warning of severe disruption across the whole network for the rest of the day. The train company said delays were still ongoing on journeys towards London Waterloo after a loss of all signalling in the Earlsfield area of south-west London. It said trains could be cancelled, delayed by up to 90 minutes or revised until the end of service. Waterloo handles about 100 million passenger journeys a year. SWT had already warned of disruption because of a track defect on a set of points between Woking and Surbiton, which blocked the London-bound fast line. A company spokesman said: ""Services are still recovering from a major signal failure on mainline services through Clapham Junction to Waterloo."" Network Rail apologised for the disruption and said it would continue to work to resume a normal service as quickly as possible. South West Trains passengers are set to face severe disruption next month when work begins to extend platforms at Waterloo, meaning many services will not be running and some commuter stations will be closed altogether.

"Ryanair says it could cut fares by as much as 9% on some routes as competition in the airline industry intensifies in the next few months. The warning from Europe's largest carrier by passenger numbers follows similar comments about price pressures from Ryanair's rivals in recent weeks. Competition was growing as airlines switched capacity from Turkey and North Africa, Ryanair said. Separately, Ryanair said it had madea ""non-binding offer"" for Alitalia. On Friday, Italian media reported that about 10 offers had been made for the loss-making airline. In a statement, Dublin-based Ryanair said it was ""important we are involved in the process"" given that Alitalia is Italy's largest carrier. Ryanair's comments came as it reported a 55% rise in pre-tax profits to 397m euros (Â£356m) in the three months to 30 June. Revenues were up 13% to 1.68bn euros. The average fare during the quarter rose 1% to 40.3 euros, although Ryanair said this was a blip due to the much stronger Easter trading. Easter, a peak-time for holidaymakers, fell in April this year, inside the carrier's reporting period. In 2016, it fell in March. The airline said it expected fares to fall by 5% in the six months to the end of September and by 8% in the six months to the end of March 2018. ""We expect the pricing environment to remain very competitive"" chief executive Michael O'Learysaid in a statement.,externalEasyJet and Wizz Air have both said that fares will be under pressure this summer. The warning sparked a 3.5% fall in Ryanair's share price. EasyJet shares fell 3.4%, while the owner of British Airways, IAG, fell 2.7%. In a bid to recoup some lost revenues, Ryanair is considering limiting the number of passengers eligible to take a second free carry-on bag. Revenues from people paying to take luggage have fallen at the airline. Mr O'Leary told analysts that it was possible that only passengers who paid for priority boarding would be eligible. However, he added that no decision had been made. Ryanair executives also repeated warnings of major flight disruptions between the UK and Europe if Brexit talks fail to agree a bi-lateral deal on flights. The airline has warned it may cancel flights and move operations abroad if there is no agreement well in advance of Brexit. ""We need clarity so that we can plan our schedules for 2019,"" chief financial officer Neil Sorahan told the BBC.

"This video can not be played Migrant deaths: How one Texas county is struggling to cope Police in the US state of Texas have arrested a truck driver whose vehicle was found in a Walmart car park with dozens of people in the back of it. Nine men had died inside, and 28 others, including children, were taken to hospital. They were inside the trailer in San Antonio without access to air conditioning or water while outside temperatures hit 38C (100F). Police say they believe the incident is linked to people smuggling. The truck's driver, named by authorities as James Mathew Bradley Jr, 60, of Clearwater, Florida, is expected to appear in court later. Video footage from the store reportedly showed a number of vehicles arriving to pick up some of the survivors. Several others may have managed to escape on foot into the woods nearby. One person found in the woods was being treated, local officials said. Mexico's government said it was working closely with US authorities to identify the nationalities of the victims. San Antonio is a few hours' drive from the border with Mexico, and the US immigration department is trying to establish the victims' legal status. San Antonio Mayor Ron Nirenberg told the BBC that caring for the victims was the authorities' first aim. ""Our most important focus right now is to deliver compassionate care,"" he said. ""You know our first responders immediately were on the scene, delivering first aid, transporting - sometimes by air - critical condition patients to local hospitals, and trying to prevent more loss of life than what had already occurred."" ""We are working with authorities, we are working with... witnesses to understand the magnitude of these crimes. ""But in this case, where we are witnesses to a human tragedy in our city, our first response and our response as local officials is to render aid."" Eight people were found to be dead at the scene while another died in hospital, immigration officials said. This video can not be played Police Chief William McManus and Fire Chief Charles Hood told reporters about the discovery Officials were brought to the trailer by a man who had approached an employee of the Walmart and asked for water. The driver would be charged in connection with the ""horrible tragedy"", said San Antonio police chief William McManusin a press briefing,external. He said the people ranged from school age to in their 30s. Local fire chief Charles Hood said the survivors had heart rates of over 130 beats per minute and were very hot to touch. In addition to the 20 people in a critical condition, eight others were taken to hospital in a less severe state. The fire chief confirmed at least two of the victims were school-age children. Their condition is not clear. ""We're very fortunate that there weren't 38 of these people who were all locked inside this vehicle dead,"" he added. The truck was towed away from the scene hours after the discovery The US attorney for the Western District of Texas, Richard Durbin, said the authorities were working to identify those responsible for the incident. ""These people were helpless in the hands of their transporters. Imagine their suffering, trapped in a stifling trailer in 100-plus degree heat,"" he said in a statement. They were victims of ""ruthless human smugglers indifferent to the wellbeing of their fragile cargo"", he added. Thirty-three migrants were found in a trailer in the same part of Texas earlier this month Experts say people smuggling is a serious issue in southern Texas, and there have been a number of similar cases in the area just in this past month. On 7 July, US Border Patrol agents found 72 undocumented immigrants from Central American countrieslocked inside a trailer,external""with no means of escape"".

"Antiretroviral drugs are currently used in HIV treatment to kill any active virus The outstanding progress in boosting the immune system to treat cancer may help unlock a cure for HIV, according to scientists meeting in Paris. The body's normal defences struggle to clear the body of HIV and cancer. But the rapidly emerging field of immunotherapy has seen some patients with terminal cancer go into complete remission. The hope is that a similar approach could clear someone of HIV, although some experts have urged caution. HIV treatment requires daily antiretroviral drugs to kill any active virus. Left unchecked, HIV can destroy the immune system, causing Aids. A cure is currently impossible because drugs and the immune system fail to detect the sleeping or ""latent"" HIV hiding in the body's cells. Nobel Prize winner and co-discoverer of HIV, Francoise Barre-Sinoussi, told the BBC: ""One of the mechanisms why [latently infected cells] persist is the fact they are proliferating very similar to tumour cells. ""Those cells are expressing molecules that are the same molecules that are expressed on tumour cells. ""So that raises the question whether we could develop a strategy for HIV-cure similar to the novel treatment in the field of cancer."" She is one of the scientists attending the HIV and Cancer Cure Forum in Paris. Prof Sharon Lewin, the director of the Doherty Institute in Australia, agrees there is much to learn from cancer. She said: ""There are a lot of parallelsâ¦ I think it's huge."" 'Mind-blowing' cows hold clue to beating HIV Aids deaths halve as more get drugs HIV life expectancy now 'near normal' Cancers evolve tricks to survive an assault by the immune system. They can produce proteins on their surface, such as PD-L1, which disable immune cells attacking the tumour. A new class of immunotherapy drugs called ""checkpoint inhibitors"" allow the immune system to keep on fighting and the results have been remarkable. In one trial, a fifth of patients with terminal melanoma had no sign of the disease after immunotherapy. However, only about 50 people with HIV have been given immunotherapy to treat their cancer. So there is little evidence of immunotherapy drugs and their effect on HIV. Prof Lewin has started doing the research in the laboratory and thinks immunotherapy drugs could reinvigorate an immune system that has become tired of fighting HIV. She said: ""The parts of the immune system that recognise HIV are often exhausted T-cells, they express immune checkpoint markers. ""In the laboratory, if you then put those cells in with an immune checkpoint blocker, the T-cells do regain function."" Antiretroviral therapy combines three or more drugs which stop the HIV virus from progressing She said there was emerging evidence that the drugs also activated HIV lying dormant inside immune cells. Prof Lewin said: ""We want the virus to wake up, any virus that wakes up gets killed [by antiretroviral drugs]."" However this is a new concept in HIV that has so far delivered nothing for patients. And there are important differences between the challenges of cancer and HIV immunology. In cancer, the immune system can recognise the threat but is not powerful enough to do anything about it, but the immune system does not recognise latently infected HIV cells at all. Dr Anthony Fauci, the head of the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said the area is ""very hot"" right now in cancer. But he cautioned: ""We have to be careful we don't assume that things that work in cancer are going to work in HIV. ""HIV is so different, that even though it's worth exploring, I wouldn't want people to think this is going to be equally successful in HIV.""

"Most women do not know how much they should be eating while pregnant, a survey has suggested. The National Charity Partnership found only a third of the expectant mothers questioned got the correct answer. Health watchdog NICE advises that in the first six months of pregnancy women do not need any extra calories. But in the last trimester they require 200 extra calories a day - equivalent to two pieces of wholegrain toast with olive oil spread. The National Charity Partnership (NCP), made up of Diabetes UK, the British Heart Foundation and Tesco, says information on what pregnant women can eat is not reaching them. Its research of 2,100 UK women suggests more than one in three expectant mothers think they have to eat 300 or more extra calories every day. Meanwhile, 61% of the 140 women who were pregnant when questioned believed they should start taking on extra calories in the first or second trimester. The NCP is working with the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RCOG) to debunk the myth of ""eating for two"" and make dietary requirements for pregnant women easier to understand. Eating for two is the idea that women need to eat for both them and their unborn child when they are pregnant. Over a quarter of pregnant women admitted they used ""eating for two"" as an excuse to eat unhealthy food all the time. Alex Davis, head of prevention for the NCP, said the myth was ""very unhelpful"" for getting the right information out to mums. ""Eating healthily and consuming healthy portion sizes are important before, during and after pregnancy to increase the chances of conceiving naturally, reduce the risk of pregnancy and birth-related complications and stave off health problems like type 2 diabetes and heart and circulatory disease in the long-term."" A woman normally needs to have 2,000 calories a day - this includes food and drink. But when you are in the last trimester of your pregnancy, you should eat 200 extra calories a day. There is no need for any additional calories in the first six months. Have a balanced diet - this is eating a variety of food from the five main groups of fruit and vegetables, carbohydrates such as pasta and potatoes, protein like pulses, fish, eggs and meat, dairy such as milk and yoghurt and fats Have a healthy breakfast every day to avoid snacking on high fat and sugar foods Get at least your five-a-day of fruit and vegetables Get fibre from wholegrain foods and nuts Make carbs just over a third of the food you eat. Carbohydrates, including bread, potatoes, rice, pasta and oats, are an important source of energy Have protein every day which can include fish, eggs and pulses Eat two portions of fish a week, only one should be oily fish like salmon or mackerel For dairy - try and choose low-fat options of milk, yoghurt and hard cheese Limit food and drinks high in fat and sugar like fizzy drinks and biscuits Choose healthy snacks such as salad vegetables, hummus, and vegetable soup Source:NHS Choices,external And you can join the debateon our Facebook page,external. Professor Janice Rymer, vice president of education for the RCOG, said eating too much while pregnant ""can be detrimental"" to mother and baby. ""Women who are overweight during pregnancy are at an increased risk of having a miscarriage and developing conditions such as gestational diabetes, high blood pressure and pre-eclampsia. ""They are also more likely to have a premature baby, require a Caesarean section, experience a haemorrhage after birth or develop a clot which can be life-threatening. ""In addition, overweight women have bigger babies who are themselves more likely to become obese and have significant health problems as a result.""

"Gregory Tiffin's body has been found, but Sophie Dowsley remains missing Canadian police have called off a search for an Australian woman who went missing while hiking earlier this month, according to her family. Sophie Dowsley 34, and her Canadian partner Gregory Tiffin, 44, had left for a day-long walk in British Columbia on 8 July. Police began a search after they did not return. Mr Tiffin's body was found near a waterfall last week. Ms Dowsley's relatives have said she ""may never be found"". Her brother, Jamie Dowsley, said the Royal Canadian Mounted Police had ""no plausible or conceivable areas left to search"" in the rugged landscape near Harrison Lake. ""After visiting this area and gaining an understanding of the terrain and conditions our family fully accept this decision,"" Mr Dowsley wrote on social media. Ms Dowsley's sunglasses and some of Mr Tiffin's personal items were found near the waterfall. The missing woman's family thanked search teams for putting their ""lives at risk"".
