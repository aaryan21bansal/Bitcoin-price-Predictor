"Police believe the weapon was going to be used to attack PSNI officers A horizontal mortar tube and command wire have been found in Castlewellan, County Down. The PSNI said the tube contained no explosive device and it was likely to be collected for use elsewhere. They were found on the Drumnaquoile Road by a member of the public at about 15:00 BST on Monday. A ""full and extensive clearance operation"" was launched in the area following the discovery. It ended on Tuesday with nothing more found. PSNI Det Supt John McVea said it was likely the tube was left by one dissident for collection by another. Mr McVea said it was not left in a position that suggested it was about to be used to launch a mortar at a passing car on the road. ""We are very pleased to have this item recovered - undoubtedly it was in the future intended to be used in an attack against the security forces,"" he said. Police believe the weapon may have been left at the building on the rural Drumnaquoile Road as recently as Sunday. The discovery prompted a major security operation in the area. ""There is a derelict farm building in the immediate vicinity. The device, the mortar tube, was left just by the wall,"" said Mr McVea. ""It was not covered in any way. ""It was in very good condition and there were no signs it had been left to the elements for any length of time and certainly we are working on the theory that it was left there in very recent times."" The weapon was found on Drumnaquoile Road on Monday Earlier a PSNI colleague had appealed to local people to come forward with information. ""We know that the vast majority of people support our police officers and simply want to live in a peaceful society,"" Det Insp Orr said. ""We will continue to work with communities to disrupt the activities of the small group of people who are intent on using violence."" The discovery of the items prompted a major security operation in the area The Police Federation for Northern Ireland (PFNI) said the discovery prevented a ""vicious dissident republican attack on police officers"". ""What this shows is the need for constant vigilance,"" PFNI Chair, Mark Lindsay said. ""This is yet another demonstration of the bankrupt nature of those who seek to inflict pain and suffering on the community."" South Down Sinn FÃ©in MP Chris Hazzard said there was no place for this type of activity in our society: ""I welcome that these materials have been taken out of circulation and out of the hands of those who cause death and destruction in the community.""

"British cosmetics firm Lush is closing several of its UK social media accounts this week. Announcing the news on Twitter, it said it was ""tired of fighting with algorithms"" and did not want to ""pay to appear"" in newsfeeds. The firm, which sells fragrant handmade soaps, bath bombs and other body products, asked customers to contact it by email, phone, or via its website. LushUK has 202,000 Twitter followers and 569,000 on Instagram. More than 423,000 have liked the page on Facebook. That account name will close on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram along with Lush Kitchen, Lush Times, Lush Life, Soapbox and Gorilla. ""We don't want to limit ourselves to holding conversations in one place, we want social to be placed back in the hands of our communities - from our founders to our friends,"" it said in a statement. However, Lush North America tweeted that its channels would remain in operation. The firm said it was ""cutting out the middleman between ourselves and the Lush community"". It also hinted that it would be trying a new social approach - and it suggested a hashtag for those wishing to chat with it. Mike Blake-Crawford from marketing agency Social Chain said the hashtag hinted at ""more work with influencers"". ""The challenge for me is how they adequately capitalise on this conversation without a centralised social media 'home' for their products and campaigns,"" he said. Other marketers expressed surprise at the move. Beauty and fashion blogger Leah tweeted that she could not ""fathom"" why Lush was shutting down an Instagram account with 568,000 followers.

"Facebook has said it is working on using artificial intelligence to prevent a common and upsetting problem: receiving notifications about deceased friends and loved ones. The company said,externalit hoped to stop the âpainfulâ experience of getting suggestions to invite dead people to events, or to wish them a happy birthday. On profiles, tributes to a person will now appear separately, keeping the deceasedâs timeline as they left it. ""We hope Facebook remains a place where the memory and spirit of our loved ones can be celebrated and live on,â said Sheryl Sandberg, Facebookâs chief operating officer. Users have often complained about being shocked and upset when Facebook nudges them to interact with a deceased loved one. Since 2009, Facebook has given users the ability to âmemorialiseâ profiles; a status which adds âRememberingâ to the personâs name and allows friends to post messages (more than 30 million people do this every month, Facebook said). Once a page has been memorialised, it no longer appears within notifications as if that person were still alive. But, for profiles of deceased users that have not yet been memorialised, Facebook said it would use AI to stop those accounts from appearing in unexpected places as well. Legacy contact control Facebook also announced other tweaks to how dead people are represented on the network. Memorialised accounts will now have a separate âtributesâ tab for people to leave condolences and memories, a move that would leave the deceasedâs timeline intact. Content posted as tributes can be moderated by a personâs âlegacyâ contacts. These are other Facebook users who they have designated as a trusted person or persons, who can take over in the event of their death. ""Legacy contacts can now moderate the posts shared to the new tributes section by changing tagging settings, removing tags and editing who can post and see posts,â Ms Sandberg explained. ""This helps them manage content that might be hard for friends and family to see if theyâre not ready.â Under-18s cannot nominate a legacy contact, but parents or guardians of children who have died can contact Facebook to request access. Some of these changes have come in response to abuses of its systems, such as a âprankâ in which users would falsely tell Facebook someone had died, locking that user out of their account, and causing friends distress. _______ Follow Dave Lee on Twitter@DaveLeeBBC,external Do you have more information about this or any other technology story?

"Families have waited more than five years for an FAI to be held The pilot of the police helicopter that crashed into the Clutha pub, killing 10 people, had received five low fuel warnings, a fatal accident inquiry has heard. At 22:19 on 29 November 2013, David Traill, who was among those who died, had told air traffic control he was returning to Glasgow City Heliport. At 22:22, the Police Scotland helicopter crashed through the roof of Glasgow's Clutha bar. Thirty one people were also injured. The court heard that at the point Mr Traill said he was returning to the Clyde heliport from Bothwell, the helicopter was estimated to have 86kg of fuel on board. Marcus Cook, senior inspector of air accidents at the Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB), said that, as well as a warning unit, the pilot also had a screen known as a Caution and Advisory Display (CAD). It should have indicated the amount of fuel in the main tank, the left supply tank and the right supply tank. Mr Cook said: ""The evidence suggests the CAD was functioning at the time."" The helicopter's warning unit had two indicators of note in relation to the fuel. They were ""Low Fuel 1"", which related to the level of fuel in the    tank supplying the left engine, and ""Low Fuel 2"", which covered the right engine. During the final flight the court heard the pilot received and acknowledged five fuel warnings. The pilot received three intermittent Low Fuel 1 warnings before a fourth, which remained on for the rest of the flight. He also received a single Low Fuel 2 warning which he acknowledged. It also remained on for the remainder of the journey. Helicopter 'spluttered' before crashing on pub Clutha pilot flew on after fuel warning Follow the BBC's Paul O'Hare who is tweeting from the inquiry,external Mr Cook told the hearing he would have expected the pilot to make a PAN call - which would have indicated he had a fuel issue - ""long before the final stages of the flight"". He said: ""The one thing you always keep an eye on is how much fuel you have on board, how much endurance you have available."" He said that if a pilot believes he is going to go below final fuel reserve he should make a mayday call. The witness said police helicopter pilots had an ""acute fuel awareness"" due to the non-routine nature of their work. Mr Cook told the court that every time a fuel warning illuminated on the helicopter's dashboard it should have been accompanied by an ""audio gong"" which would be heard by anyone on board. The warning must be acknowledged and suppressed by pressing a button. He added that the pilot was instructed on the technicalities of the helicopter's fuel system during his initial conversion training in 2008. This included the requirement to land within 10 minutes of being presented with a low fuel warning. The court heard an excerpt from the AAIB report which noted that at the time of the accident in November 2013, the EC135 model of aircraft had accumulated more than three million flying hours over 20 years. It added: ""There had not previously been a reported instance of fuel starvation."" (Top: left to right) David Traill; PC Kirsty Nelis; PC Tony Collins; Gary Arthur; Samuel McGhee (Bottom: left to right) Colin Gibson; Robert Jenkins; Mark O'Prey; John McGarrigle; Joe Cusker Mr Cook said the pilot received three low rotor speed warnings and made some attempt to manage the rotor output before the crash. The FAI was told the warnings are triggered when the speed dips below 97% but if it drops below 75% it is ""irrecoverable"". Mr Cook agreed with Sean Smith QC that it would be an ""unusual event"" for a pilot to experience an engine flame out. Asked about the probability of a double engine flame out, the witness replied: ""More unusual"". And he agreed that David Traill was an experienced pilot and had spent 646 hours at the controls of an EC135 helicopter. At the time of the crash the helicopter had 76kg of fuel on board. Asked by Donald Findlay QC, who is representing the family of Robert Jenkins, if that would have been enough - under normal circumstances - for it to reach the Glasgow City Heliport, Mr Cook replied: ""Probably."" In October 2015a report from the AAIB,externalconcluded the pilot did not follow emergency protocol and flew on despite the low fuel warnings. It also found fuel transfer pumps were turned off and a controlled landing was not achieved for ""unknown reasons"". And it recommended that all police helicopters should be equipped with black box flight recording equipment. More than 100 people were in The Clutha when the Eurocopter EC 135, operated by Bond Air Services, crashed into the bar. Pilot David Traill, 51; PC Tony Collins, 43; and PC Kirsty Nelis, 36, lost their lives along with seven customers who were in the bar on Stockwell Street. They were Gary Arthur, 48; Joe Cusker, 59; Colin Gibson, 33; Robert Jenkins, 61; John McGarrigle, 58; Samuel McGhee, 56; and Mark O'Prey, 44. The second day of the hearing earlier heard that AAIB investigators had received nothing ""new or significant"" enough for the original investigation to be reopened despite being sent various documents over the years. Philip Sleight, deputy chief inspector of air accidents at the AAIB, told the court that the AAIB's purpose was to investigate the circumstances of an accident and make recommendations with the intention of preventing a reoccurrence. He said the focus of the AAIB was ""encouraging safety"" not ""apportioning blame"". This video can not be played Clutha helicopter crash: how the events unfolded Mr Findlay asked who the relatives could speak to about differences between the draft and final report. Mr Sleight said the differences could not be discussed because of regulations. Mr Findlay asked if the families of those who died just have to accept that. Mr Sleight replied ""yes"". Mr Sleight told the inquiry: ""It is quite normal for a report to change significantly between draft and final."" Mr Cook, who was part of the team that prepared the AAIB report, told the court about the communication on board helicopter. He said it was the responsibility of the pilot to liaise with Air Traffic Control. Separately, the Police Scotland Airwave system was used for operational purposes. He told the hearing both means of communication were recorded. Clutha survivor: 'Going back to pub helped my recovery' Clutha families 'punished again' over FAI The helicopter's last journey was traced by radar. It left Glasgow at 20:45 to respond to reports of someone being struck by a train at Oatlands. It then travelled to Dalkeith for a routine task before carrying out surveillance in Bothwell, Uddingston and Bargeddie. The FAI, which is being held in a temporary court at Hampden Park football ground, has now adjourned for the day and will resume on Wednesday. It is expected to hear about three months' worth of evidence between now and August but it will not sit every day. 29 November 2013: Police helicopter crashes on Clutha bar in Glasgow, killing 10 people. 9 December 2013: AAIB preliminary report finds there was 95 litres of fuel onboard the aircraft. 14 February 2014: AAIB special report finds both engines ""flamed out"". One of the fuel tanks was empty, while a second contained 0.4 litres. A third contained 75 litres, but transfer pumps to take this fuel to the other two engine tanks were switched off. 23 October 2015: AAIB final report finds main cause of accident to be mismanagement of the fuel system by the pilot. 24 November 2017: Fatal accident inquiry announced.

"Shana Grice was murdered by her ex-boyfriend who stalked her Three police officers are facing disciplinary action over the case of a woman who was fined for wasting police time when she reported the stalker ex who went on to murder her. Shana Grice, 19, reported Michael Lane five times before he slit her throat and tried to burn her body. Her parents slammed Sussex Police for ""treating her like a criminal"", adding the action was ""too little too late"". A report found stalking cases were not being properly investigated. Two officers - one retired - will face gross misconduct proceedings at public hearings in May. A third officer faces internal misconduct action. Sharon Grice and Richard Green said: ""Our daughter took her concerns to the police and instead of being protected was treated like a criminal. She paid for the police's lack of training, care and poor attitude with her life. ""It's only right that the police make changes, but it's too little, too late for Shana. ""Sussex Police should not be applauded for this."" Michael Lane was convicted of murdering Miss Grice in 2017 No further action will be taken against five officers investigated by the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC), while six other force employees - three officers and three staff - have been given ""management advice and further training"". The independent report by Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary and Fire & Rescue Services (HMICFRS) was commissioned after Miss Grice was killed in her bedroom in Portslade, near Brighton, East Sussex, in 2016. Stalking and harassment is more common in Sussex than the national average, it said. However, victims were often not referred to specialised support services and the force regularly failed to use powers including searching perpetrators' homes or seeking injunctions. Lane fitted a tracker to Miss Grice's car and stole a house key to sneak into her room as she slept. He was given a life sentence with a minimum term of 25 years in March 2017. It later emerged that 13 other women had reported him to police for stalking. Murdered teen's stalker ex-boyfriend jailed 'He said he was close enough to smell my hair' Police ordered to improve stalking probes At his sentencing, Mr Justice Nicholas Green said officers had ""jumped to conclusions"" and ""stereotyped"" Miss Grice. Assistant Chief Constable Nick May said: ""We deeply regret the tragic death of Shana Grice in 2016 and are committed to constantly improving our understanding of stalking and our response to it. ""When we looked at the circumstances leading to Shana's murder, we felt we may not have done the very best we could and made a referral to the IOPC."" Police found a tracking device on Miss Grice's car Sarah Green, co-director of the End Violence Against Women Coalition, said: ""The police watchdog findings that Sussex Police failed and that there will be misconduct hearings are welcome, but much more is needed. ""Numerous inquests and inquiries have found that multiple police forces have failed to protect women who were murdered."" The report also called on the National Police Chiefs' Council (NPCC) for a single definition for stalking to be adopted by police forces and government departments. Sussex Police has been given three months to make improvements.

"The tribunal said it was ""satisfied"" Dr Hadiza Bawa-Garba had reflected on the events that led to Jack Adcock's death A doctor convicted over the death of a six-year-old boy can return to work, a medical tribunal has ruled. In 2015, Dr Hadiza Bawa-Garba was foundguilty of gross negligence manslaughter over the death of Jack Adcock. She was struck off in 2018 but appealed against the decision and won her bid to be reinstated to the medical register. The Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service (MPTS) has now ruled Dr Bawa-Garba can return to work, but only under close supervision. The doctor will resume work - although at a lower grade than she was previously employed at - once she returns from maternity leave in February 2020. Tribunal chairwoman Claire Sharp said the chance of Dr Bawa-Garba putting another patient at unwarranted risk of harm was low and she had undertaken a ""significant"" amount of remediation. However, the tribunal found the doctor's fitness to practise was ""impaired"" as she had not had face-to-face contact with patients since 2015. Jack's parents, Nicky and Victor, from Leicestershire, had opposed Dr Bawa-Garba being allowed to practise again. Giving evidence at the hearing, the doctor apologised to the Adcock family. Jack Adcock died at Leicester Royal Infirmary in 2011 when undiagnosed sepsis led to cardiac arrest In 2011, Jack, who had Down's syndrome and a heart condition, died from a cardiac arrest caused by sepsis 11 hours after being admitted to hospital. Prosecutors in Dr Bawa-Garba's criminal trial said his death was caused by an incorrect diagnosis and ""serious neglect"" by staff. Dr Bawa-Garba'sdefence said she had worked a 12-hour shift with no breakand there was miscommunication on the ward. The doctor was removed from medical duties ahead of the trial. She was later given a two-year suspended sentence by the court. This video can not be played Dr Hadiza Bawa-Garba said she was ""sorry for her role"" in Jack Adcock's death In 2017 the MPTSsuspended her from the medical register for a year, but the General Medical Council appealed against the decision and in January 2018 she was struck off at the High Court. Dr Bawa-Garba subsequently took her case to theCourt of Appeal and in August won her bid to be reinstated. She is currently serving a suspension until July but wants to return to work full-time in February. Giving its determination, the MPTS said the doctor had ""reflected appropriately"" on the events of Jack's death and had undertaken significant steps to remediate concerns identified in 2017. A number of conditions were put in place on Dr Bawa-Garba's registration, and will be in place for two years from July. During the hearing, Dr Bawa-Garba said: ""I am sorry for my failure to recognise sepsis. ""I apologise for the pain I have caused the family, the pain will live with me for the rest of my life."" Sitting in the public gallery, Mrs Adcock interjected: ""Eight years too late."" Speaking after the tribunal, she added: ""I don't think she should ever be allowed in a hospital again."" Jack's parents Victor and Nicky Adcock attended the tribunal A GMC statement said the process had been ""difficult"" for the Adcock family. It added: ""'The GMC and Dr Bawa-Garba's representatives both submitted to the medical practitioners tribunal that her fitness to practise remains impaired due to the length of time she has been out of practice. ""It is important the doctor's return to practise is safely managed."" However, Jenny Vaughan, law and policy officer for the Doctors' Association UK, said it was ""right"" that Dr Bawa-Garba would be allowed to return to work. She said: ""Dr Bawa-Garba was working in appalling conditions that day in an NHS hospital...there is a culture of blame in the NHS at the moment which, if left unchecked, will mean patient safety is not what it should be as staff will be too scared to admit their mistakes.""

"British cosmetics firm Lush is closing several of its UK social media accounts this week. Announcing the news on Twitter, it said it was ""tired of fighting with algorithms"" and did not want to ""pay to appear"" in newsfeeds. The firm, which sells fragrant handmade soaps, bath bombs and other body products, asked customers to contact it by email, phone, or via its website. LushUK has 202,000 Twitter followers and 569,000 on Instagram. More than 423,000 have liked the page on Facebook. That account name will close on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram along with Lush Kitchen, Lush Times, Lush Life, Soapbox and Gorilla. ""We don't want to limit ourselves to holding conversations in one place, we want social to be placed back in the hands of our communities - from our founders to our friends,"" it said in a statement. However, Lush North America tweeted that its channels would remain in operation. The firm said it was ""cutting out the middleman between ourselves and the Lush community"". It also hinted that it would be trying a new social approach - and it suggested a hashtag for those wishing to chat with it. Mike Blake-Crawford from marketing agency Social Chain said the hashtag hinted at ""more work with influencers"". ""The challenge for me is how they adequately capitalise on this conversation without a centralised social media 'home' for their products and campaigns,"" he said. Other marketers expressed surprise at the move. Beauty and fashion blogger Leah tweeted that she could not ""fathom"" why Lush was shutting down an Instagram account with 568,000 followers.

"Theresa May had last-minute Brexit talks with French President Emmanuel Macron on Tuesday The request for delay is an answer to one question. When confronted with the possibility of taking the UK out of the EU without a formal deal in place or slamming on the brakes, which way would the prime minister jump? Would she choose a pure plan - pursuing Brexit over the risk of instability? Or would Theresa May heed the voices of warning, rather than those in her own party arguing that any short-term pain would be worth long-term gain, and ask for delay, despite the embarrassment of doing so, and the frustration of those who wanted her to keep the promise of leaving on time? Mrs May kept many in Westminster guessing for a long time. But her meetings in Europe, her plea on Tuesday, are evidence of the decision she finally took - that almost any entreaties to European leaders are worth it to avoid opening Pandora's Box. Pausing again brings embarrassment and angers many on her own side, but it's a lesser evil than departing with no deal. If the prime minister is granted a strings-attached delay later, the next question is perhaps as big. What will she do with the extra time she's been granted? Will it even be up to her? Tusk suggests Brexit delay of up to a year Brexit: Significant hurdles for cross-party talks Cross-party talks with the Labour Party are serious - both sides in the room are taking part in good faith and expect more negotiations on Thursday. But the more talking they do, the more the scale of the task to bring them together reveals itself. Forget a quick solution from this joint process, and don't bank on one happening at all. The divisions may simply be too great - the moment when it might have worked perhaps has passed. If that fails, then the answer may pass again, back to Parliament - MPs confronted again with the power to choose from a wide array of different choices - with the ability, if not yet the common purpose to choose a version of Brexit for all of us. And of course, if a long delay is agreed it could push hungry Tories who want a change of leadership again into action. But the obvious response to another question is crystal clear - who is in charge for today? It's the EU leaders who will determine the date and nature of this delay - not the country that voted in an effort to pull back control.

"The Labour Party's negotiating team includes Rebecca Long Bailey and Sir Keir Starmer ""Are they serious?"" Labour and the Conservatives are separately pondering that same question tonight - wondering whether their political rivals really are genuine about finding common cause. Guess what, just for a change, the leaderships of both of the main Westminster parties are dealing with boiling tensions on their front and back benches. And they both have reasons to tiptoe towards each other in these cross-party talks, but both sides too have reasons to tread carefully. In truth, both sides are serious that they could possibly get serious about a deal, but the obstacles are significant. The Tories have still not, and may never feel able to offer a clear promise of pursuing a customs union. What sources familiar with the talks say the focus is right now, is trying to point out to Labour that the existing deal contains the possibility of shaping that kind of arrangement in the future. Irony upon irony, the backstop which the government has been protesting about for so long provides the ingredients for exactly that kind of relationship with the EU in the long term. That is precisely why Brexiteers hated it so much - because they feared (correctly perhaps) it might be used as the basis on which to build the kind of tight trading deal with the EU they seek to avoid. What are the Brexit sticking points? Sturgeon warns about 'bad Brexit compromise' For the prime minister to overtly pursue such a deal is already provoking fury in parts of her party - although it's also striking now how frustrated some middle of the road Tory MPs are - fed up of what they see as both ""extremes"", hogging the oxygen and holding everything up. But unless and until Theresa May is ready to give a firmer commitment on customs, it is hard to see how Labour would be ready to sign on the dotted line. Although the two sides will meet again in the next 24 hours, Jeremy Corbyn again has expressed his view that the government hasn't shifted any of those red lines. And even if that were to happen, there are (at least!) two other big blocks to success. There is deep anxiety in the Labour Party about being able to trust anything that is agreed. The government's already promised that they could change the law to give guarantees in the Brexit implementation bill. But both sides admit privately even if they came up with some kind of ""lock"", it's just not feasible to rule out any future prime minister ever unpicking the deal. In a different era this might not be such a problem. But the prime minister has already said that she will quit, and quit once the deal is done. So of course, Labour MPs are very nervous about how the promises made in these talks could last. That's whether the next leader were to be Boris Johnson, Dominic Raab , Jeremy Hunt or frankly, the Queen of Sheba - it's about the permanence of any promise. And, as I understand it, the two groups, even with serious intention, have not as things stand been able to come up with a formula that guards against this. Second of all, officials and politicians in the discussions have talked about the possibility of another referendum on the EU - whether you call it a ""confirmatory vote"", a ""ratificatory referendum"", or a ""people's vote"" - another chance for all of us to have a say. This has not though yet been a big focus of the talks - it seems like an issue that has been danced around the edges. Will Labour push for a public vote? Labour chair offered to quit over Brexit Here's the thing: a hefty chunk of the Labour Party is adamant that they will only back a deal if it comes with a promise of another referendum. And that opinion among Labour backbenchers has been hardening, not softening in recent weeks. So even if the talks can find away around the customs conundrum, and then find a ""lock"" to make Labour comfortable with any promises that are made, there is a third profound dilemma. Number 10 has always made it abundantly clear that the prime minister believes that's a nightmare not worth contemplating. The problem for these talks is that for a big chunk of the parliamentary Labour Party that's the dream they are pursuing. There are others who disagree, and disagree profoundly. But in terms of making this process work, the Labour Party's votes can't be delivered in one big chunk. With huge political imagination, invention, (whose mother after all they say is a necessity, and there's certainly a necessity right now), it is of course possible that this process could get there. In this long tangled process a lot of things that have seemed impossible can in the end come to pass. But just as both sides in these talks are serious, the problems are serious too.

"The tribunal said it was ""satisfied"" Dr Hadiza Bawa-Garba had reflected on the events that led to Jack Adcock's death A doctor convicted over the death of a six-year-old boy can return to work, a medical tribunal has ruled. In 2015, Dr Hadiza Bawa-Garba was foundguilty of gross negligence manslaughter over the death of Jack Adcock. She was struck off in 2018 but appealed against the decision and won her bid to be reinstated to the medical register. The Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service (MPTS) has now ruled Dr Bawa-Garba can return to work, but only under close supervision. The doctor will resume work - although at a lower grade than she was previously employed at - once she returns from maternity leave in February 2020. Tribunal chairwoman Claire Sharp said the chance of Dr Bawa-Garba putting another patient at unwarranted risk of harm was low and she had undertaken a ""significant"" amount of remediation. However, the tribunal found the doctor's fitness to practise was ""impaired"" as she had not had face-to-face contact with patients since 2015. Jack's parents, Nicky and Victor, from Leicestershire, had opposed Dr Bawa-Garba being allowed to practise again. Giving evidence at the hearing, the doctor apologised to the Adcock family. Jack Adcock died at Leicester Royal Infirmary in 2011 when undiagnosed sepsis led to cardiac arrest In 2011, Jack, who had Down's syndrome and a heart condition, died from a cardiac arrest caused by sepsis 11 hours after being admitted to hospital. Prosecutors in Dr Bawa-Garba's criminal trial said his death was caused by an incorrect diagnosis and ""serious neglect"" by staff. Dr Bawa-Garba'sdefence said she had worked a 12-hour shift with no breakand there was miscommunication on the ward. The doctor was removed from medical duties ahead of the trial. She was later given a two-year suspended sentence by the court. This video can not be played Dr Hadiza Bawa-Garba said she was ""sorry for her role"" in Jack Adcock's death In 2017 the MPTSsuspended her from the medical register for a year, but the General Medical Council appealed against the decision and in January 2018 she was struck off at the High Court. Dr Bawa-Garba subsequently took her case to theCourt of Appeal and in August won her bid to be reinstated. She is currently serving a suspension until July but wants to return to work full-time in February. Giving its determination, the MPTS said the doctor had ""reflected appropriately"" on the events of Jack's death and had undertaken significant steps to remediate concerns identified in 2017. A number of conditions were put in place on Dr Bawa-Garba's registration, and will be in place for two years from July. During the hearing, Dr Bawa-Garba said: ""I am sorry for my failure to recognise sepsis. ""I apologise for the pain I have caused the family, the pain will live with me for the rest of my life."" Sitting in the public gallery, Mrs Adcock interjected: ""Eight years too late."" Speaking after the tribunal, she added: ""I don't think she should ever be allowed in a hospital again."" Jack's parents Victor and Nicky Adcock attended the tribunal A GMC statement said the process had been ""difficult"" for the Adcock family. It added: ""'The GMC and Dr Bawa-Garba's representatives both submitted to the medical practitioners tribunal that her fitness to practise remains impaired due to the length of time she has been out of practice. ""It is important the doctor's return to practise is safely managed."" However, Jenny Vaughan, law and policy officer for the Doctors' Association UK, said it was ""right"" that Dr Bawa-Garba would be allowed to return to work. She said: ""Dr Bawa-Garba was working in appalling conditions that day in an NHS hospital...there is a culture of blame in the NHS at the moment which, if left unchecked, will mean patient safety is not what it should be as staff will be too scared to admit their mistakes.""

"Families have waited more than five years for an FAI to be held The pilot of the police helicopter that crashed into the Clutha pub, killing 10 people, had received five low fuel warnings, a fatal accident inquiry has heard. At 22:19 on 29 November 2013, David Traill, who was among those who died, had told air traffic control he was returning to Glasgow City Heliport. At 22:22, the Police Scotland helicopter crashed through the roof of Glasgow's Clutha bar. Thirty one people were also injured. The court heard that at the point Mr Traill said he was returning to the Clyde heliport from Bothwell, the helicopter was estimated to have 86kg of fuel on board. Marcus Cook, senior inspector of air accidents at the Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB), said that, as well as a warning unit, the pilot also had a screen known as a Caution and Advisory Display (CAD). It should have indicated the amount of fuel in the main tank, the left supply tank and the right supply tank. Mr Cook said: ""The evidence suggests the CAD was functioning at the time."" The helicopter's warning unit had two indicators of note in relation to the fuel. They were ""Low Fuel 1"", which related to the level of fuel in the    tank supplying the left engine, and ""Low Fuel 2"", which covered the right engine. During the final flight the court heard the pilot received and acknowledged five fuel warnings. The pilot received three intermittent Low Fuel 1 warnings before a fourth, which remained on for the rest of the flight. He also received a single Low Fuel 2 warning which he acknowledged. It also remained on for the remainder of the journey. Helicopter 'spluttered' before crashing on pub Clutha pilot flew on after fuel warning Follow the BBC's Paul O'Hare who is tweeting from the inquiry,external Mr Cook told the hearing he would have expected the pilot to make a PAN call - which would have indicated he had a fuel issue - ""long before the final stages of the flight"". He said: ""The one thing you always keep an eye on is how much fuel you have on board, how much endurance you have available."" He said that if a pilot believes he is going to go below final fuel reserve he should make a mayday call. The witness said police helicopter pilots had an ""acute fuel awareness"" due to the non-routine nature of their work. Mr Cook told the court that every time a fuel warning illuminated on the helicopter's dashboard it should have been accompanied by an ""audio gong"" which would be heard by anyone on board. The warning must be acknowledged and suppressed by pressing a button. He added that the pilot was instructed on the technicalities of the helicopter's fuel system during his initial conversion training in 2008. This included the requirement to land within 10 minutes of being presented with a low fuel warning. The court heard an excerpt from the AAIB report which noted that at the time of the accident in November 2013, the EC135 model of aircraft had accumulated more than three million flying hours over 20 years. It added: ""There had not previously been a reported instance of fuel starvation."" (Top: left to right) David Traill; PC Kirsty Nelis; PC Tony Collins; Gary Arthur; Samuel McGhee (Bottom: left to right) Colin Gibson; Robert Jenkins; Mark O'Prey; John McGarrigle; Joe Cusker Mr Cook said the pilot received three low rotor speed warnings and made some attempt to manage the rotor output before the crash. The FAI was told the warnings are triggered when the speed dips below 97% but if it drops below 75% it is ""irrecoverable"". Mr Cook agreed with Sean Smith QC that it would be an ""unusual event"" for a pilot to experience an engine flame out. Asked about the probability of a double engine flame out, the witness replied: ""More unusual"". And he agreed that David Traill was an experienced pilot and had spent 646 hours at the controls of an EC135 helicopter. At the time of the crash the helicopter had 76kg of fuel on board. Asked by Donald Findlay QC, who is representing the family of Robert Jenkins, if that would have been enough - under normal circumstances - for it to reach the Glasgow City Heliport, Mr Cook replied: ""Probably."" In October 2015a report from the AAIB,externalconcluded the pilot did not follow emergency protocol and flew on despite the low fuel warnings. It also found fuel transfer pumps were turned off and a controlled landing was not achieved for ""unknown reasons"". And it recommended that all police helicopters should be equipped with black box flight recording equipment. More than 100 people were in The Clutha when the Eurocopter EC 135, operated by Bond Air Services, crashed into the bar. Pilot David Traill, 51; PC Tony Collins, 43; and PC Kirsty Nelis, 36, lost their lives along with seven customers who were in the bar on Stockwell Street. They were Gary Arthur, 48; Joe Cusker, 59; Colin Gibson, 33; Robert Jenkins, 61; John McGarrigle, 58; Samuel McGhee, 56; and Mark O'Prey, 44. The second day of the hearing earlier heard that AAIB investigators had received nothing ""new or significant"" enough for the original investigation to be reopened despite being sent various documents over the years. Philip Sleight, deputy chief inspector of air accidents at the AAIB, told the court that the AAIB's purpose was to investigate the circumstances of an accident and make recommendations with the intention of preventing a reoccurrence. He said the focus of the AAIB was ""encouraging safety"" not ""apportioning blame"". This video can not be played Clutha helicopter crash: how the events unfolded Mr Findlay asked who the relatives could speak to about differences between the draft and final report. Mr Sleight said the differences could not be discussed because of regulations. Mr Findlay asked if the families of those who died just have to accept that. Mr Sleight replied ""yes"". Mr Sleight told the inquiry: ""It is quite normal for a report to change significantly between draft and final."" Mr Cook, who was part of the team that prepared the AAIB report, told the court about the communication on board helicopter. He said it was the responsibility of the pilot to liaise with Air Traffic Control. Separately, the Police Scotland Airwave system was used for operational purposes. He told the hearing both means of communication were recorded. Clutha survivor: 'Going back to pub helped my recovery' Clutha families 'punished again' over FAI The helicopter's last journey was traced by radar. It left Glasgow at 20:45 to respond to reports of someone being struck by a train at Oatlands. It then travelled to Dalkeith for a routine task before carrying out surveillance in Bothwell, Uddingston and Bargeddie. The FAI, which is being held in a temporary court at Hampden Park football ground, has now adjourned for the day and will resume on Wednesday.

"Benny Gantz (L) is seeking to prevent Benjamin Netanyahu (R) winning a fifth term in office Exit polls in Israel suggest there will be no clear winner in the closely fought general election. The centrist Blue and White alliance of former military chief Benny Gantz was projected to win 36 or 37 seats, with the Likud party of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu taking 33 to 36. Both men have claimed victory. Two exit polls predicted that right-wing parties allied to Mr Netanyahu were more likely to be able to form a governing coalition. But a third exit poll predicted that the bloc would be tied with centre-left parties allied to Mr Gantz. Israel's election: Five things to know Israel election: Who are the key candidates? Benjamin Netanyahu: Commando turned PM Benny Gantz: Ex-military chief trying to unseat Netanyahu ""We won! The Israeli public has had its say!"" Blue and White said in a statement. ""These elections have a clear winner and a clear loser."" But at his party's election headquarters in Tel Aviv, Mr Netanyahu was also celebrating. ""It is a night of colossal victory,"" he said. ""I'm very touched that, for the fifth time, the people of Israel have believed in me."" No party has ever won a majority in Israel's 120-seat parliament, the Knesset, and the country has always had coalition governments. Analysis by the BBC's Tom Bateman in Tel Aviv At the election night event for Benny Gantz in Tel Aviv, a huge cheer went up as the first exit poll was released. His supporters expressed confidence that Israel could be on the brink of a new centre-ground government. ""Change is on the way,"" one activist told me above the roars of celebration. But the outcome is far from clear. At the last election, the exit polls were dramatically wrong. And the real politics start now if there is a close result - as both main parties canvass Israel's president for the right to start talks to assemble a coalition. Mr Netanyahu could overtake Israel's founding father David Ben-Gurion as its longest-serving prime minister if he is re-elected for a fifth term. The 69-year-old has put forward tough messages on security, which is one of the election's key issues. He also made a significant announcement in the final days of the campaign, suggesting a new government would annex Jewish settlements in the occupied West Bank. The settlements are considered illegal under international law, although Israel disputes this. Mr Netanyahu is also facing allegations of corruption which he denies. He says he is a victim of a political ""witch hunt"" aimed at influencing the election. In a separate controversy on Tuesday, Israeli Arab politicians condemned his Likud party for sending 1,200 observers equipped with hidden body cameras to polling stations in Arab communities. The Arab alliance, Hadash-Taal, said it was an ""illegal"" action that sought to intimidate Arabs. Likud said it wanted to ensure only ""valid votes"" were cast. Mr Netanyahu's main challenger, Mr Gantz, is a retired lieutenant-general who formed the Blue and White in February, promising to unite a country that had ""lost its way"". The 59-year-old former chief of staff of the Israeli military can rival Mr Netanyahu on security and is promising cleaner politics. Mr Gantz's campaign platform refers to ""separation"" from the Palestinians but does not specifically mention them having an independent state. It also calls for continued control over the Jordan Valley and retaining West Bank settlement blocs. Three Israeli television networks carried out separate exit polls: Public broadcaster Kan projected that Blue and White would win 37 seats and Likud 36. It said the right-wing bloc was expected to control 64 seats in parliament and the centre-left bloc 56 Channel 13 predicted both parties with end up with 36 seats, but that right-wing parties would control 66 seats to the centre-left's 54 Channel 12 News projected that Blue and White would win 37 seats and Likud 33 seats. But it had the centre-left and right-wing blocs both controlling 60 seats The three predicted that the left-wing Labour party would win between six and eight seats, and the left-wing Meretz party between four and five seats. It was not clear how many of the more than 40 smaller parties contesting the election would win at least 3.25% of the national vote - the threshold for entering parliament with four seats. Two exit polls suggested outgoing Education Minister Naftali Bennett's New Right party and Moshe Feiglin's ultra-nationalist Zehut party had not passed the threshold.

"Mike Ashley's Sports Direct has said that the takeover of Debenhams by its lenders as part of an administration process is ""nothing short of a national scandal"". The store chain rejected two last-ditch takeover offers from Sports Direct. Under Tuesday's deal, all stores will remain open for now, although some have been earmarked for closure. Mr Ashley said politicians and regulators had been ""as effective as a chocolate teapot"". He also called for the administration process to be reversed. Debenhams is the biggest department store chain in the UK with 166 stores. It employs about 25,000 people. Its lenders are made up of High Street banks and US hedge funds. Mr Ashley said reversing the administration process would mean that ""a full, better and appropriate solvent solution can be found"". And he added: ""This solution would include allowing myself and appropriate senior Sports Direct management access to detailed information to save the business for all stakeholders. ""The board of Debenhams and its advisers have sought to stifle and exclude us from their so-called process and have undermined and blocked our various offers of assistance as they carried out their underhand plan to steal from shareholders."" This video can not be played Chris Wootton, deputy chief financial officer at Sports Direct, says they wanted to keep stores open Sports Direct said it had formally registered its interest in buying Debenhams from its new owners. However, Chris Wootton, Sports Direct's deputy chief financial officer told the BBC he believed Debenhams lenders may already have a plan in place: ""It's a case of the deal being done with a third party that keeps us locked out of it."" He said the firm was considering legal action against Debenhams' board over shareholders' losses. Debenhams has passed through a pre-pack administration process. This lets a company sell itself, or its assets, as a going concern, without affecting the operation of the business. The lenders now take control of the business and will look to sell it on, while shareholders lose their investments. It means that Mr Ashley's near-30% stake in the company, which cost about Â£150m to build up, is wiped out. On Monday, Debenhams rejected a Â£150m rescue offer from Sports Direct, which was increased to Â£200m in the early hours of Tuesday. The higher offer was rejected because Mr Ashley wanted to be chief executive. Mike Ashley had two rescue attempts rejected All Debenhams' stores will initially continue to trade, although about 50 branches had already been earmarked for closure in the future. Its lenders include Barclays and Bank of Ireland, as well as Silver Point and GoldenTree. Debenhams: Three things that went wrong Why we no longer love department stores Unlikely stars bucking the High Street slump As well as the planned closures, it has also been renegotiating rents with landlords to tackle its funding problems. It has not released a list of which shops may be shut. In February, it was revealed that the closure of 20 stores could be brought forward if the retailer took out a company voluntary arrangement (CVA), a form of insolvency that can enable firms to seek rent cuts and close unwanted stores. The company explained that its restructuring plans would continue and that, if approved, they would ""result in a significant overall reduction in the group's rent burden and underpin a sustainable future"". The stores will continue to trade as normal and administrators have confirmed to the BBC that customers will be able to spend any gift cards that they already have. Debenhams chairman Terry Duddy said: ""We remain focused on protecting as many stores and jobs as possible, consistent with establishing a sustainable store portfolio in line with our previous guidance. ""In the meantime, our customers, colleagues, pension holders, suppliers and landlords can be reassured that Debenhams will now be able to move forward on a stable footing."" A spokesman for the company's pension schemes said the schemes had been transferred to the newly incorporated company. ""Members can therefore be reassured that the schemes are carrying on as usual."" The biggest loser today is Mike Ashley. In this tussle, he's found himself on the wrong side of the fence. Debenhams has a huge pile of debt, which it needed to refinance and couldn't afford to repay. In the end, lenders were calling the shots on the fate of this business. Mr Ashley's series of proposals all came with strings attached, which the lenders simply didn't like. One major sticking point was that he wanted to become chief executive. The hostilities became ever more acrimonious, which didn't help. At one point,he suggested two board members take lie detector tests. The lenders were also suspicious of Mr Ashley's intentions. ""If we give him the keys to the castle, he might change the locks,"" said one person familiar with the situation. The stores will continue to trade as normal, but there's another restructuring to come. Debenhams has already said it needs to close 50 stores. The first tranche would come after Christmas, providing a deal with landlords can be struck. This is an undignified outcome for a business that's graced our High Streets for more than 200 years. The new owners are already looking for a buyer, willing to take on the huge debts and liabilities of this household name. Debenhams has been struggling for a while and issued three profit warnings in 2018. It also has a debt pile of Â£622m. Last year, it reported a record pre-tax loss of Â£491.5m. It later reported that its sales had fallen sharply over Christmas. The company floated on the stock market in 2006 with a share price of Â£1.95, and its share price peaked at Â£2.07 the following day. However, it suffered as a result of more people deciding to shop online rather than in-store and footfall was reduced. The scale and high cost of running stores as well as the investments needed to run a company in the modern retailing environment also put the company under financial pressure. This is despite Debenhams being the largest traditional department store chain in the UK. Its highest pre-tax profit since its flotation was Â£160.3m in 2011, but last year it lost Â£491.5m. Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: ""As an investment, Debenhams is a tale of woe from start to finish. ""Hindsight is a wonderful thing, but the road to Debenhams' ruin has been paved with poor decisions, as well as a dramatic shift towards digital shopping."" Richard Lim, chief executive of Retail Economics said: ""We should not understate the significance of this collapse. Debenhams has fallen victim to crippling levels of debt, which has paralysed its ability to pivot towards a more digital and experience-led retail model."" Eleanor Snow, Which? consumer rights editor, said: ""Debenhams has long been a staple of the British high street so this is a worrying time for its customers and they may find their consumer rights are affected.""

"European Council president Donald Tusk says the EU should consider offering the UK a ""flexible"" delay to Brexit of up to a year, with the option of leaving earlier if a deal is ratified. He said there was ""little reason to believe"" a Brexit deal would be approved by the extension deadline UK PM Theresa May has requested - 30 June. Writing to EU leaders, he said any delay should have conditions attached. It is up to EU members to vote on the proposals at a summit on Wednesday. A draft EU document circulated to diplomats ahead of the emergency summit also proposes an extension but leaves the date of the proposed new deadline blank. The BBC's Brussels correspondent Adam Fleming said the document referred to an extension lasting ""only as long as is necessary and, in any event, no longer than XX.XX.XXXX and ending earlier if the withdrawal agreement is ratified"". The UK is currently due to leave the EU at 23:00 BST on Friday. So far, UK MPs have rejected the withdrawal agreement Mrs May reached with other European leaders last year, so she is now asking for the leaving date to be extended. Meanwhile, Mrs May has been meeting French President Emmanuel Macron in Paris and German Chancellor Angela Merkel in Berlin for talks ahead of the summit. Afterwards, Ms Merkel said a delay that ran until the end of this year or the start of 2020 was a possibility. Kuenssberg: Brexit delay proves lesser evil for May Adler: EU keen to quiz May ahead of Brexit summit A really simple guide to Brexit Mr Tusk said granting the 30 June extension that Mrs May is seeking ""would increase the risk of a rolling series of short extensions and emergency summits, creating new cliff-edge dates"". And if the European Council did not agree on an extension at all, ""there would be a risk of an accidental no-deal Brexit"", he said. ""One possibility would be a flexible extension, which would last only as long as necessary and no longer than one year, as beyond that date we will need to decide unanimously on some key European projects."" This video can not be played There was no-one to greet the PM as she arrived to meet the German chancellor for Brexit talks in Berlin Mr Tusk said the EU would need to agree on a number of conditions to be attached to any proposed extension, including that there would be no re-opening of negotiations on the withdrawal agreement. He said the UK should be treated ""with the highest respect"" and ""neither side should be allowed to feel humiliated"". BBC Europe editor Katya Adler said the EU's draft conclusions ""should be taken with a big pinch of salt"" as EU leaders could ""rip up the conclusions and start again"" on Wednesday. She said the fact that the length of delay had been left blank in the conclusions shows EU leaders were still divided on the issue. Theresa May met French President Emmanuel Macron in Paris for last-minute talks ahead of Wednesday's EU summit Downing Street said Mrs May had discussed the UK's request for an extension of Article 50 - the process by which the UK leaves the EU - until 30 June, with the option to make it shorter if a deal is ratified earlier, with both Ms Merkel and Mr Macron. The prime minister and Chancellor Merkel agreed on the importance of ensuring Britain's orderly withdrawal, a statement said. Mrs May and Mr Macron also discussed next month's European Parliamentary elections, with the prime minister saying the government was ""working very hard"" to avoid the need for the UK to take part as it is supposed to if it is still a member of the EU on 23 May. Brexit explained in flowcharts Brexit Basics: The customs union DUP says PM's 'pleading is humiliating' Kuenssberg: Significant hurdles for cross-party talks Following a meeting of the EU's General Affairs Council in Luxembourg, diplomats said ""slightly more than a handful"" of member states spoke in favour of delaying Article 50 until 30 June but the majority were in favour of a longer extension. EU leaders are curious to hear the prime minister's Plan B. They hope there is one, although they're not convinced. They want to know, if they say, ""Yes,"" to another Brexit extension, what it will be used for. And they suspect Theresa May wants them to do her dirty work for her. EU diplomatic sources I have spoken to suggest the prime minister may have officially asked the EU for a short new extension (until 30 June) as that was politically easier for her back home, whereas she believed and hoped (the theory goes) that EU leaders will insist instead on a flexible long extension that she actually needs. The bottom line is: EU leaders are extremely unlikely to refuse to further extend the Brexit process.

They are hoping to reach compromise changes to the Brexit deal agreed by Mrs May that could be accepted by the Commons, with Labour pushing for the inclusion of a customs union. That would allow tariff-free trade in goods with the EU but limit the UK from striking its own deals. Leaving the arrangement was a Conservative manifesto commitment. Environment Secretary Michael Gove said the talks had been ""open and constructive"" but the sides differed on a ""number of areas"". Labour's shadow business secretary Rebecca Long Bailey said they were ""hopeful progress will be made"". Further talks will be held on Thursday.

"Sony describes the giant 16K display as acting like a ""window to the world"" The biggest 16K screen of its kind will shortly go on show in Japan. Sony's display has four times as many horizontal pixels as a 4K television and eight times that of a regular 1080p high definition TV, meaning it can show images in far more detail than normal. This will let viewers stand close to the unit - which is longer than a bus - without its image looking blurred. One expert said it would likely take decades for 16K tech to filter down to consumer products. The 63ft by 17ft (19.2m by 5.4m) screen is currently being installed at a new research centre that has been built for the Japanese cosmetics group Shiseido in the city of Yokohama, south of Tokyo. It is so large it will stretch between the first and second floors. The development was announced by Sony at the National Association of Broadcasters (NAB) trade show, which is currently being held in Las Vegas. ""We're moving slowly towards 8K TVs at the end of the decade and who knows how long it will take to get beyond that, so 16K is likely to be limited to the corporate world for the time being,"" commented David Mercer from the consultancy Strategy Analytics. ""But there's no doubt about it. These displays are incredibly impressive in person - even 8K on a big display is almost mesmerising. ""When you get to this resolution it delivers almost a quasi-virtual reality experience as your eyes perceive there to be depth to the content."" Space Odyssey helps launch first 8K TV channel Samsung's shape-shifting TVs revealed 8K TV: Samsung and LG reveal rival screens Sony had previously designed a separate 16K display that went on show at Tokyo's Haneda Airport in 2014, but that looked like it was made up of dozens of smaller screens rather than presenting a single seamless picture. Sony built an ultra-wide 16K display for Haneda Airport five years ago The new ""super-size"" installation has in fact been created out of several modular panels, but because they do not have bezels they can be fitted together without any visible gaps to create the impression of being a single screen. Sony calls the technology ""Crystal LED"", which is its brand name for micro-LED display tech. Samsung is also experimenting with the format. The innovation does not require a backlight, but goes much brighter than OLED (organic light-emitting diode) screens while still delivering similar deep blacks. At present, however, the high manufacturing costs involved make it too expensive for widespread use. For now, Sony is pitching a range of smaller, lower-resolution Crystal LED displays for use in office lobbies, car showrooms, cinemas and theme parks. Since little 16K footage exists elsewhere, the firm has produced its own film for Shiseido showing life-size animal wildlife. It has not disclosed the method involved, but has previously achieved what is known as ""quad ultra-high definition"" footage by using a method called demosaicing. This involves applying an algorithm to 8K footage to deduce what the additional pixels should look like, similar to the way 4K TVs sometimes up-sample 1080p footage.

"Schools across Walsall said children struggled with basic skills such as communication and toilet training, the councillor said An infant school has employed someone to change nappies because so many pupils are not toilet-trained, a councillor has said. Chris Towe, Walsall Council's portfolio holder for education, said: ""We are talking about five-year-olds here and it is not acceptable."" He said it was among many examples of children in the West Midlands borough starting school without basic skills. Schools told him many pupils could not communicate or hold a pencil properly. Head teachers had also raised concerns that school starters could not use cutlery or dress themselves. Mr Towe told the BBC he had spoken to the heads of 80 infant and primary schools and found the lack of basic skills to be a ""massive issue"". ""I was quite shocked really,"" he said. ""If they haven't got basic skills, how can they be educated? ""This cannot go on. If it doesn't stop it is going to get even worse."" Latest news from the West Midlands Mr Towe told a meeting of the Conservative-run council that head teachers believed many children were two or three years behind where they should be,the LDRS reported. ""Clearly, over the years, many parents have not been taking responsibility in making sure their children are ready for school,"" he said. The council plans to send letters informing parents of the skills children need and where they can get help. Diane Coughlan, a Labour councillor, said the borough had a lot of vulnerable families with a range of issues. She said: ""For many parents, school readiness is simply not a priority for them, so apart from simply sending a letter what other support will they be given?"" Research by children's charity Eric and the National Day Nurseries Association suggestedchildren were being toilet-trained later,external. The issue was discussed onBBC Breakfast in February.

"This wolf was photographed in a wildlife park in Germany. But wild German wolves have been crossing the border into the Netherlands The Netherlands has its first resident wolf population in 140 years, according to ecologists. Wolves were hunted out of many European countries over a century ago but have gradually been migrating back across the continental mainland. Occasional wolf sightings have been made in the Netherlands since 2015. But these animals were previously thought to be animals that had crossed over temporarily from Germany and would subsequently return there. Ecologists from campaign groups FreeNature and Wolven in Nederland have been tracking two females in the Veluwe area, collecting wolf prints and scat (droppings) from which they can identify DNA. Presenter Tom Heap holds a box containing wolf excrement found in the Netherlands ""It's like Tinder,"" said ecologist Mirte Kruit, ""it can say if it's a male or female, are they single and looking for a mate and [tell you] about their family."" They've told BBC Radio 4's Costing the Earth that their data now confirms one of the females has stayed continuously for six months and can now be considered ""established"". A male has also been seen in the area so the first Dutch wolf pack could be months away. They are still collecting data on the second female. The Alpes de Haute Provence region has some 22 wolf packs Wolves are controversial, however. In France, since returning from Italy in 1992, populations have grown rapidly. Sheep and goat farmers say they're suffering rising attacks, with around 12,000 incidents reported. Farmers can receive compensation if they have protection measures in place, like electric fences or guard dogs, but many are still angry about the damage caused to the flock. The French Government formed a cohabitation plan and in February last year set a target wolf population of 500 by 2023. However, it's thought this number may be reached or surpassed by this Winter. France is proposing to increase the cull rate from 12% to 17% if that's confirmed. Wolves are protected under the Berne convention and can only be killed under specific circumstances. Costing the Earth presenter Tom Heap travelled to Alpes de Haute Provence to meet some of those affected. The region has 22 wolf packs - the largest of any region - and last year the region saw 700 attacks. Farmer Simon Merveille said he witnessed one of his goats being eaten by wolves. Mr Merveille believes farmers should be allowed to kill wolves that attack livestock ""I was astonished because when I fired a warning shot they just stayed looking at me - they did not leave,"" he explained. Mr Merveille is happy for wolves to remain in France but believes farmers must be allowed to kill them when they attack livestock. Andre Maurelle and Ingrid Briclot, who also farm in the region, saw three wolves killing five of their sheep and taking a sixth. They have now installed 12km of electric fences and have an apprentice shepherd, Mady, who is used to guarding cattle from lions and snakes in Mali. ""We have to learn to cohabit,"" said Mr Maurelle. Back in Holland, Wolven in Nederland have been working since 2008 to prepare the Dutch people for this very moment - the return of the wolf to the country. Ecologist Roeland Vermeulen says settled wolves are more likely to eat deer or wild boar. Sheep, on the other hand, are ""like junk food"", taken by roaming wolves or those less experienced at hunting. He thinks the Netherlands has room for 22 packs - each of 5-8 wolves. Whether the country can learn from others and find a suitable balance will become apparent in the years to come. Costing the Earth: The Wolf is Back is on BBC Sounds and on Radio 4 tomorrow at 9pm BST.

"This video can not be played What is in the books that Parkfield parents are protesting about? It is up to primary schools in England to choose what they teach about same-sex relationships, the education secretary has said. Damian Hinds haswritten to head teachers,externalsaying they are encouraged to teach children about LGBT issues if they ""consider it age appropriate"". He said heads should consult parents but reassured them parents had no right to veto what was taught. It follows protests over the content of lessons in some schools in Birmingham. LGBT lesson row head teachers 'feel alone' LGBT row school staff 'distraught' LGBT people 'never felt more vulnerable' Rallies have been held outside the city's Parkfield Community School in protest at the ""No Outsiders"" programme, which teaches pupils about diversity, including LGBT rights and issues of race and religion. Some parents said they believed the lessons ""undermined parental rights and authority"" - despite Ofsted's view thatthe lessons at Parkfield were age-appropriate. Parkfield assistant headAndrew Moffat, who created the No Outsiders programme,told Sky News he had received a death threat,external, while others involved in the row have also reported feeling ""alone"" and unsupported. This video can not be played Parents claimed ""hundreds"" of pupils were kept out of school for a day The school and four others in Birminghamhave now suspended teaching the No Outsiders programme. The controversy has spread further afield, with parents in Greater Manchester saying they will remove their children from sex and relationship lessons. Parents have been gathering outside the school for weekly protests In his letter to the National Association of Head Teachers (NAHT), Mr Hinds says reports of teachers feeling intimidated are ""concerning"" and it was ""regrettable that myths and misinformation"" about education changes were allowed to be circulated. He suggests listening to and understanding the views of parents as a way schools can ""increase confidence in the curriculum"" to help children leave school ""prepared for life in modern, diverse Britain"". But he writes: ""What is taught, and how, is ultimately a decision for the school."" And he adds: ""I want to reassure you and the members you represent that consultation does not provide a parental veto on curriculum content. We want schools to consult parents, listen to their views, and make reasonable decisions about how to proceed... and we will support them in this."" This video can not be played The woman in charge of the trust running Parkfield school defends its LGBT rights teaching In response, the NAHT said its members were ""encouraged"" by the letter and called for parents' protests to stop. Paul Whiteman, general secretary of the union, said: ""This letter confirms that whilst school leaders are required to involve parents and the wider community in the planned content of the curriculum, consultation does not provide parents or others with a veto on curriculum content. ""Schools that take this approach will receive the full support of the government."" He added: ""There is clearly more to be done in Birmingham and in other areas where protests and disagreements have happened."" The head teacher of one school in Birmingham where protests have been held also welcomed the letter, but said the government should go further. Referring to the education secretary, Anderton Park Primary head Sarah Hewitt-Clarkson said: ""It's good he's come out and said in black and white that there is no veto for the parents on what's being taught - that's a key misunderstanding for some."" But she added that the government should have a ""clear national policy"" on how to teach pupils about same sex relationships rather than ""leaving it up to the schools"". In England, relationships education will becompulsory for all primary pupils from September 2020. Sex education will also be compulsory for all secondary pupils from that date.

"Mike Ashley owns more than 60% of Sports Direct Sports Direct says Debenhams has rejected its offer to inject Â£150m into the troubled department store chain. Retail tycoon Mike Ashley tabled the rescue bid on the condition that he be made chief executive of Debenhams. He has been locked in an acrimonious battle with Debenhams' board for control of the business and has accused its executives of ""a sustained programme of falsehoods and denials"". Debenhams' rejection means it is likely to go into administration this week. The firm is set to go through a pre-pack administration, which would mean current shareholders - including Mr Ashley who owns nearly 30% of the chain - would be wiped out. While the shops would continue trading for now, Debenhams has proposed closing around 50 branches from next year and renegotiating rents with landlords to tackle its funding problems. In a statement, Sports Direct said it was ""disappointed"" with the response to its proposal to raise Â£150m by issuing new shares, which would also have seen lenders write off Â£148m of the chain's debt. But the retailer said it was still giving ""active consideration"" to a separate offer, first proposed in March, to take over Debenhams by purchasing existing shares. It's been an extraordinary tussle for control of Debenhams. Barring a last minute twist, Mike Ashley has found himself on the losing side. His latest 11th hour proposal has been rejected by lenders. The retailer doesn't have much choice. It has Â£560m of debt and its creditors are now effectively calling the shots. Despite nearly Â£3bn of sales last year, the business is now worth less than Â£30m as its share price has crashed to less than 2p. The board believes the best option is to be rescued by its lenders. This is set to take the form of a pre-pack administration. An announcement could come as early as Tuesday. It will be business as usual for its shops and staff. But store closures down the line are inevitable. Debenhams has already said it needed to shut 50 stores in the coming years. That plan will now be accelerated, with up to 20 expected to go in early 2020 through a restructuring process with landlords. On Sunday, in its latest swipe at Debenhams management, Sports Direct called for an investigation and for the firm's shares to be suspended. A strongly-worded statement accused Debenhams' board members of misrepresenting what had happened in a meeting between the two firms andurged them to undergo lie detector tests. The struggling department store, which has 165 stores and employs about 25,000 people,reported a record pre-tax loss of Â£491.5m last year. If Mr Ashley does gain control of Debenhams, he would control yet another High Street name. As well as Sports Direct, Mr Ashley runs House of Fraser, Evans Cycles and Flannels. In January, Mr Ashley joined investor Landmark Group to vote the chairman and chief executive of Debenhams off the board. High Street retailers have been under increasing pressure as more people choose to shop online and visit stores less. Debenhams secures Â£200m lifeline Can Mike Ashley save debt-laden Debenhams?

"Danny Drinkwater will appear before magistrates charged with drink driving next month Chelsea and England footballer Danny Drinkwater has been charged with drink-driving after a car crash. The midfielder was arrested after a Range Rover crashed in Mere, Cheshire, in the early hours of Monday. Two women and a man were treated at the scene for minor injuries, Cheshire Police said. Mr Drinkwater, 29, of Nether Alderley in Cheshire, was released on unconditional bail to appear at Stockport Magistrates' Court on 13 May. Police were called to reports of a crash on Ashley Road, Mere, at 00:30 BST on Monday Police were called to reports of a one-vehicle crash on Ashley Road in Mere at 00:30 BST and arrested the footballer. The former Manchester United trainee won the last of histhree England capsin 2016. Danny Drinkwater played 35 times as Leicester won the Premier League in 2015-16 Danny Drinkwater was a product of the Manchester United youth academy but did not make a senior appearance for the club, spending loan spells at Huddersfield, Cardiff, Watford and Barnsley before joining Leicester in 2012. The midfielder was named in the Championship Team of the Year as the Foxes won promotion to the Premier League in the 2013-14 season. He remained a key part of the Leicester side as they overcame odds of 5,000-1 to win the Premier League under Claudio Ranieri in 2015-16. His performances during the Foxes' remarkable title-winning campaign earned him a first England call-up, making his debut against the Netherlands at Wembley in March 2016 and going on to win three caps to date. However, having asked to leave the club, he joined Chelsea in a Â£35m deal in September 2017, following former team-mate N'Golo Kante to Stamford Bridge after the midfielder's move the previous summer. The 29-year-old played 22 times in all competitions as injury disrupted his first season with the Blues and he has found himself frozen out under new boss Maurizio Sarri this term, with his only appearance coming in the Community Shield.

"Divorce laws in England and Wales are to be overhauled so couples can split faster and, it is hoped, with less acrimony. Under current rules, one spouse has to allege adultery or unreasonable behaviour by the other for divorce proceedings to start straight away. In future, they will only have to state that the marriage has broken down irretrievably. It will also stop one partner refusing a divorce if the other one wants one. Justice Secretary David Gauke said the changes would help to end the ""blame game"". Currently, ""fault-based"" divorces, where there are allegations of adultery or unreasonable behaviour - can take as little as three to six months. But ""no-fault"" divorces can take much longer - with couples having to prove they have been living apart for at least one year in Scotland, and at least two years in the rest of the UK. Living apart can include living in the same house, provided they are not sharing a bed or living as a couple. 'I was married and divorced in my 20s' Should it be easier to get a divorce? Humanist marriages 'least likely to end in divorce' Mr Gauke told BBC News: ""Frankly, we are not going to keep marriages together by having a divorce process that just makes it more acrimonious [and] tries to apportion blame in such a way that the couple are likely to have a weaker, poorer relationship subsequently than they would otherwise do."" He said the new law would be introduced as soon as possible, when parliamentary time allowed. The changes follow the Supreme Court's rejection of a woman's appeal for divorce after her husband refused to agree a split. Tini Owens, 68, from Worcestershire, wanted to divorce her husband of 40 years, on the grounds that she was unhappy. But husband Hugh refused to agree to it and the Supreme Court unanimously rejected her appeal. It meant the couple must remain married until 2020. The UK's most senior judge, Baroness Hale - who is also one of the judges overseeing that case - has repeatedly called for the laws to be overhauled, describing them as ""unjust"". Law firm Payne Hicks Beach said its client Ms Owens welcomed the proposed changes. The firm added that Ms Owens hoped nobody else would have to go through the ""long and painful process she has had to endure"". Tini Owens was refused a divorce by the family court and Court of Appeal The new rules will include a minimum timeframe of six months from petition stage to decree absolute - the legal document that ends a marriage. At the end of this period the applicant will be required to continue to affirm their decision to seek a divorce before the divorce is granted. The government says this will give a ""meaningful period of reflection"" and the ""opportunity to turn back"". In addition, a new option will allow couples to apply for a divorce jointly. By BBC legal correspondent Clive Coleman The introduction of a ""no fault"" system is huge. It represents the biggest change in divorce law in 50 years. Why has it happened? Because the current fault-based divorce system is now seen by many to exacerbate the stress and tension of an already highly stressful time. Critically it exposes children to the damaging impact of ongoing conflict between their parents both during the divorce and afterwards. While the wider family justice system attempts to help people to resolve issues in a non-confrontational way, the legal divorce process can make this more difficult because of the way it throws fault and blame into the mix when spouses are trying to end their relationship and make sensible living arrangements for their children. Fault, blame and having to prove two or five years separation were not seen to be helping couples move on with their lives - and that's why they are being consigned to legal history. Lydia Vowden said her divorce was a protracted one which took a toil on her emotionally Lydia Vowden, from Exeter, said she left her husband in June 2016 but it took more than two years for her divorce to be finalised. ""In that time I was an emotional mess and also struggling financially, as I had left the marital home with nothing. ""Disregarding the huge amount of financial cost, the emotional ramifications of the process are horrendous. ""A change to the system can only be a positive and will hopefully allow some of the stigma around divorce to be removed,"" she added. Read more about people's experiences of the divorce laws here. The plans come after a 12-week public consultation which showed widespread support for no-fault divorce. Mr Gauke said overhauling divorce law could help prevent conflict between parents, which in turn risk damaging their children's futures. The blame element can cause ""incredible animosity"" between separating parents, Aidan Jones, chief executive of the charity Relate, told BBC News. He said: ""That's what can cause difficultly for the children but also it can cause difficulty for the parents themselves, so anything we can do to reduce that is, I think, incredibly important."" Divorce lawyer Zahra Pabani, family partner at Shakespeare Martineau, welcomed the announcement and called on the government to help move family law ""into the 21st Century"". ""The wounds of divorce aren't only felt by the separating couple, but also by their children and wider family,"" she said. ""This firm commitment by the government to help end the mud-slinging process that divorce so often becomes is long overdue."" But Colin Hart, chairman of Coalition for Marriage, said the current system's ""in-built delay"" allowed for calm reflection and he raised concerns about access to children, assets and the family home. The blame game: Divorcing in the UK 'I'm divorced, so Sikh men don't want me' 13 people file for divorce on Christmas Day This video can not be played The existing law 'requires you to focus on the negative', says Amelia Jacob. People who apply for a divorce must prove their marriage has broken down and give one of the following five reasons: Adultery Unreasonable behaviour Desertion The couple has lived apart for more than two years and both agree to the divorce The couple has lived apart for at least five years, even if one partner disagrees Source: Gov.UK In Scotland, simplified divorce procedure is available to couples without children of the marriage under 16, where people can prove their marriage is broken down. This can happen with one year's separation, with the consent of both partners, or two years separation without consent. Otherwise, there are two legal grounds for divorce: 1) The marriage has broken down irretrievably, which must be proved by: Adultery Unreasonable behaviour The couple has lived apart for more than one year and both agree to the divorce The couple has lived apart for more than two years, but one does not agree to divorce 2) One partner has an interim gender recognition certificate - issued to a transsexual person who is starting the legal process of recognition of their acquired gender.

"This video can not be played The ""Umbrella Movement"" activists said they would continue to strive for democracy Nine pro-democracy activists in Hong Kong have been found guilty of public nuisance charges for their role in a civil disobedience movement that called for free elections in the city. Among them are three prominent activists, seen as figureheads of Hong Kong's pro-democracy movement. They could be jailed for up to seven years for their part in the ""Umbrella Movement"" protests of 2014. Thousands marched demanding the right for Hong Kong to choose its own leader. Those convicted include the so-called ""Occupy trio"" - sociology professor Chan Kin-man, 60, law professor Benny Tai, 54, and Baptist minister Chu Yiu-ming, 75. They are seen as the founders of the movement that galvanised protesters in their campaign of civil disobedience. ""No matter what happens today... we will persist on and do not give up,"" Mr Tai told reporters ahead of the verdict. Mr Tai, Mr Chan and five others were found guilty of two charges of public nuisance,external, and Mr Chu and one other of just one charge. A large crowd gathered outside the court on Thursday to support them. It is not yet clear when they will be sentenced. Chu Yiu-ming, Benny Tai and Chan Kin-man (left to right) were charged under colonial-era laws that carry possible jail terms of up to seven years By Martin Yip, BBC News Chinese, Hong Kong The nine defendants walked into the court building looking refreshed and in high spirits. All but one said a few words in what might have been their last hours of freedom before their predicted jail term. Delivering his verdict, Justice Johnny Chan said the defendants had caused a nuisance - by occupying major roads - leading to injuries among civilians. The nine looked calm and not particularly emotional. They were later released on bail. Benny Tai, Chan Kin-man and Chu Yiu-ming smiled as they passed me, as if it was just another day. They are yet to say if they will appeal. The court was adjourned for the day as the lawyers are yet to finish their mitigation submissions. The sentences have yet to be announced. The broader pro-democracy camp already has bad relations with Beijing. Activists and politicians did express their anger but political analysts also warn that people might simply leave the movement out of frustration. ""Some people might feel dispirited and helpless. I hope they can see that other people haven't given up,"" Benny Tai told BBC News Chinese ahead of today's verdict. Seventy nine days of sit-in protests have already changed Hong Kong a lot. But today's verdict might serve more as a reminder that this city remains divided. At the trial Judge Johnny Chan rejected the idea that this would have a substantial impact on society. ""It cannot be reasonably argued that a charge of conspiracy to cause public nuisance would generate a chilling effect in society,"" he wrote in his ruling. But rights groups criticised the ruling, with Humans Rights Watch saying the court was ""sending a terrible message"". ""[This] will likely embolden the government to prosecute more peaceful activists, further chilling free expression in Hong Kong,"" said researcher Maya Wang in a statement to the BBC. One pro-democracy supporter outside the court held up a sign saying ""People's Hero"" Lord Chris Patten, the last British governor of Hong Kong, released a statement saying that it was ""appallingly divisive to use anachronistic common law charges in a vengeful pursuit of political events which took place in 2014"". This verdict comes after a string of frustrations for pro-democracy activists. In the last few years the courts have removed six lawmakers for changing their swearing in oaths to include protest phrases. Others have also been disqualified from running for office. The protests started in reaction to a decision made by China that it would allow direct elections in 2017, but only from a list of candidates pre-approved by Beijing. Beijing is highly sensitive about Hong Kong's status and any calls for more autonomy from China. The former British colony was handed back in 1997 on condition it would retain ""a high degree of autonomy, except in foreign and defence affairs"" for 50 years. Many people in Hong Kong believe they should have the right to elect their own leader. Young and unhappy in Hong Kong Beijing's struggle to win Hong Kong's young hearts In 2014, the three activists' calls for non-violent civil disobedience joined with student-led protests and snowballed into the massive demonstrations. Tens of thousands of people camped in the streets and demanded the right to fully free leadership elections. The pro-democracy protests bought an area of central Hong Kong to a standstill for weeks in 2014 The protests became known as the ""Umbrella Movement"" after people used umbrellas to shield themselves from pepper spray fired by police to disperse the crowd. Protesters accused the Chinese government of breaking its promise to allow full democracy in Hong Kong, and of encroaching more and more on the region. But the number of protesters dwindled to just a few hundred as the weeks dragged on and they ultimately failed to achieve their goal.

"This video can not be played Israel election: Will voters shift to the right? Israel is holding its most closely-fought general election in years. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, leader of the right-wing Likud Party, is seeking a fifth term in office. But he is facing corruption allegations and a strong challenge from former military chief Benny Gantz, head of the centrist Blue and White alliance. Pre-election polls suggested the two main contenders were neck-and-neck and that they would need to rely on smaller parties to form a governing coalition. Negotiations are expected to start soon after polls close at 22:00 local time (19:00 GMT). No party has ever won a majority in Israel's 120-seat parliament, the Knesset, and the country has always had coalition governments. More than 40 parties are contesting Tuesday's election, but only about a dozen are expected to overcome a 3.25% threshold, allowing them to enter parliament with four seats or more. Israel's election: Five things to know Israel election: Who are the key candidates? Israel's Benjamin Netanyahu: Commando turned PM The ex-military chief trying to unseat Netanyahu Final polls suggested Likud and Blue and White would both win about 30 seats. The left-wing Labour party was predicted to come third with about 10 seats, followed by the Arab alliance Hadash-Taal and United Torah Judaism, which represents ultra-Orthodox Jews. In Israel's fragmented party system the advantage remains with Mr Netanyahu, who still looks most likely to be able to form a new coalition government, says the BBC's Tom Bateman in Jerusalem. In a widely criticised move to lock down extra right-wing seats, Mr Netanyahu brokered a deal in February making it easier for candidates from an extreme-right wing party that many view as racist to enter parliament.  6.3mregistered voters 3months of campaigning 47parties taking part 120seats in parliament up for grabs On Tuesday, Israeli Arab politicians condemned Likud for sending 1,200 observers equipped with hidden body cameras to polling stations in Arab communities. Hadash-Taal said it was an ""illegal"" action by the ""extremist right"" that sought to intimidate Arabs and reduce turnout, but Likud said it wanted to ensure only ""valid votes"" were cast. A leading pollster said on Tuesday afternoon that he had never seen such a low turnout among Israeli Arabs, who make up almost a fifth of the population. The 69-year-old, who could overtake David Ben-Gurion as Israel's longest-serving prime minister if he is re-elected, called voting a ""sacred act"" when he cast his ballot in Jerusalem on Tuesday. ""You need to choose well, but I can't tell you for whom,"" he said. ""Or I can, but I'm not going to. God willing, Israel will win."" At a rally in Jerusalem on Monday, Mr Netanyahu told Likud supporters not to be ""complacent"" and urged them to turn out at polling stations. He warned that his ""leftist"" rivals could still win. Benjamin Netanyahu will become Israel's longest-serving prime minister if he is re-elected Our correspondent says Mr Netanyahu has appealed to Israel's increasingly right-wing voter base with tough messages on security and a significant announcement in the final days suggesting a new government would annex Jewish settlements in the occupied West Bank. The settlements are considered illegal under international law, although Israel disputes this. Our correspondent says Mr Netanyahu has faced an uncomfortable election race, dogged by looming corruption charges, and a flare-up in the conflict with Palestinian militants in the Gaza Strip. The prime minister denies the corruption allegations, and says he is a victim of a political ""witch hunt"" aimed at influencing the election. The 59-year-old retired lieutenant-general is a newcomer to politics who formed the Blue and White in February, promising to unite a country that had ""lost its way"". Casting his vote in the town of Rosh Haayin, near Tel Aviv, he called on Israelis to respect democracy and ""take responsibility"". Benny Gantz has vowed to form a government that would ""act responsibly, firmly and decisively"" ""Go to vote. Choose whoever you believe in. Respect each other and let us all wake up for a new dawn, a new history that we need to begin,"" he said. The former chief of staff of the Israeli military can rival Mr Netanyahu on security - one of the election's key issues - and is promising cleaner politics. He told Blue and White supporters in Tel Aviv on Monday that the prime minister wanted to ""create a legal fortress to guarantee his legal immunity in front of the serious charges he is facing"". Mr Gantz's campaign platform refers to ""separation"" from the Palestinians but does not specifically mention them having an independent state. It also calls for continued control over the Jordan Valley and retaining West Bank settlement blocs. Asked about the Israeli election on Tuesday, Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas told reporters in the West Bank: ""We hope they choose the just path, in the right direction, to reach out for peace.""

"There has been a ""steep rise"" in the number of people struggling to get hold of medication which helps control their seizures, the Epilepsy Society says. The charity says ""anxiety and stress"" are putting patients at greater risk of seizures. It is calling for the government to commission an urgent review of the medicines supply chain. Although uncertainties around Brexit have highlighted medicine shortages, there has been a problem for years. Last week the drug company Sanofi said there were shortages of an epilepsy drug, sodium valproate or Epilim, in some areas because of supply disruption at a factory last year, and not related to Brexit. The company added that the situation was improving. A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: ""As Sanofi has made clear, these issues are unrelated to our exit from the EU and they have followed the well-established processes we have to manage the small number of supply problems that may arise at any one time."" The Epilepsy Society said rising numbers of people had been contacting the charity's helplineworried about getting hold of medication,external. Other drugs causing most concern for patients with epilepsy are: Epanutin (phenytoin) Topamax (topiramate) Neurontin (gabapentin) Carbagen (carbamazepine) Diazepam (rectal diazepam) Clare Pelham, chief executive of the Epilepsy Society said: ""It is simply not good enough for drugs manufacturers to say 'production issues' or 'just-in-time manufacture problems' and shrug their shoulders whenever a shortage occurs. ""Surely the least that we can do - government, charities and the pharmaceutical industry - is to work together to ensure that the supply of this essential medication is reliable every day, and every month - year in and year out. ""So that when the Brexit spotlight has moved on, people with epilepsy will be in a much better place."" Epilepsy is a common serious neurological condition which affects more than half a million people in the UK. Naproxen is on a list of drugs affected by price rises and supply shortages At the same time, a leading pharmaceutical group has said there are increasing problems obtaining some medicines in England. The number of drugs on a list of those affected by price rises and supply shortages is at the highest level since records were first compiled in 2014. This consists of drugs where the government agrees to compensate pharmacists for higher costs. In March there were 96 medicines on the list, known as price concessions - double the number last autumn. The Pharmaceutical Services Negotiating Committee (PSNC) warned MPs in December that there were supply shortages due to several factors, including Brexit contingency planning. The Committee indicates the situation has become more acute since then. While noting that there have always been fluctuations in the number of medicines which are in short supply, PSNC chief executive Simon Dukes added: ""Community pharmacies are reporting increasing problems sourcing some generic medicines for their patients."" The government told the pharmaceutical industry to build up stockpiles of six weeks' supply of medicines, as part of contingency planning for a no-deal Brexit. Other measures - including the chartering of ferries and aircraft - have been adopted by officials. A Department of Health spokesperson said: ""We are confident that, if everyone does what they need to do, the supply of medicines should be uninterrupted in the event of a no-deal.""

"Police believe the weapon was going to be used to attack PSNI officers A horizontal mortar tube and command wire have been found in Castlewellan, County Down. The PSNI said the tube contained no explosive device and it was likely to be collected for use elsewhere. They were found on the Drumnaquoile Road by a member of the public at about 15:00 BST on Monday. A ""full and extensive clearance operation"" was launched in the area following the discovery. It ended on Tuesday with nothing more found. PSNI Det Supt John McVea said it was likely the tube was left by one dissident for collection by another. Mr McVea said it was not left in a position that suggested it was about to be used to launch a mortar at a passing car on the road. ""We are very pleased to have this item recovered - undoubtedly it was in the future intended to be used in an attack against the security forces,"" he said. Police believe the weapon may have been left at the building on the rural Drumnaquoile Road as recently as Sunday. The discovery prompted a major security operation in the area. ""There is a derelict farm building in the immediate vicinity. The device, the mortar tube, was left just by the wall,"" said Mr McVea. ""It was not covered in any way. ""It was in very good condition and there were no signs it had been left to the elements for any length of time and certainly we are working on the theory that it was left there in very recent times."" The weapon was found on Drumnaquoile Road on Monday Earlier a PSNI colleague had appealed to local people to come forward with information. ""We know that the vast majority of people support our police officers and simply want to live in a peaceful society,"" Det Insp Orr said. ""We will continue to work with communities to disrupt the activities of the small group of people who are intent on using violence."" The discovery of the items prompted a major security operation in the area The Police Federation for Northern Ireland (PFNI) said the discovery prevented a ""vicious dissident republican attack on police officers"". ""What this shows is the need for constant vigilance,"" PFNI Chair, Mark Lindsay said. ""This is yet another demonstration of the bankrupt nature of those who seek to inflict pain and suffering on the community."" South Down Sinn FÃ©in MP Chris Hazzard said there was no place for this type of activity in our society: ""I welcome that these materials have been taken out of circulation and out of the hands of those who cause death and destruction in the community.""

"Chief Constable George Hamilton is to retire in the summer The job of chief constable of the Police Service of Northern Ireland has been advertised, with new oversight built in to the recruitment process. The aim is to identify the next holder of the Â£207,000-a-year post by May - a month before George Hamilton retires. For the first time, the Policing Board has hired a firm of external advisors to ensure the appointment withstands scrutiny and potential legal challenge. Politicians on the interview panel will be given two days intensive training. The board took legal advice on the participation of politicians in selection aftercomments by the Sinn FÃ©in president, Mary Lou McDonald. In February she voiced opposition to an internal successor to Mr Hamilton, leading to claims she had compromised the competition. Mary Lou McDonald's comments were criticised Butthe board stuck with precedent and five politicians, including Sinn FÃ©in MLA Linda Dillon, are includedon the eight-person selection panel. Advisors will ""quality assure"" the scoring throughout the interview process. Having been chief constable since 2014, Mr Hamilton declined a three-year contract extension earlier this year. He will retire in June after 34 years as a police officer and whoever succeeds him will be the PSNI's fifth chief constable. The closing date for applications is 7 May, with interviews for short-listed candidates due to take place about two weeks later.

"Phoebe Waller-Bridge, who created the show, and Fleabag trended on Twitter after the finale aired The finale of hugely popular comedy series Fleabag has been met with enthusiastic praise by fans and critics, after airing on Monday night. The last episode of series two had been highly anticipated by viewers - especially after one of the show's starssaid it will not be returning. TheDaily Telegraph said,externalthe finale was ""a near perfect work of art"", whilethe Metro called,externalit a ""masterpiece"". And on Twitter, viewers said they were left ""heartbroken"" that it had ended. The first series of BBC Three's Fleabag - broadcast in 2016 - was adapted from Phoebe Waller-Bridge's award-winning play. Waller-Bridge went on to win a Bafta and two Royal Television Society Awards for the show. It returned this year for series two, airing on BBC One as well, and has captivated viewers with the title character's tantalising relationship with a charismatic priest, played by Irish actor Andrew Scott. Serena Davies, head of culture at the Telegraph,said,external""it would be hard to overstate what Waller-Bridge has done with Fleabag series two"". ""Her faultlessly paced tragic comedy, or rather her comic tragedy, is a near perfect work of art. It also rips up the rule book."" She added: ""It is hard to think of anything so profound being so lightly told."" Creator Waller-Bridge and actress Sian Clifford play sisters in the acclaimed sitcom Meanwhile,Metro reviewer Cydney Yeates called,externalthe ending ""emotionally satisfying"". ""Fleabag will be heralded triumphant for decades to come, not just for its dark comedy and novelty guinea pig cafe, but for its frank discussions surrounding sex and raw narratives surrounding grief and miscarriage,"" she added. In its review,the Guardian said,externalthe second series ""raised the bar so utterly that at times Waller-Bridge's risks and progression were so impressive all one could do was shake one's head in appreciation"". It said two things stood out in the second series - the instances when Fleabag's trademark breaking of the fourth wall was itself broken, and the ""staggering"" performances of the new cast members. Andrew Scott's priest has been a popular addition to the cast ""Judging by social media chatter and IRL [in real life] conversation, it seems as though many who either did not watch the first series, or who didn't think it lived up to the hype, have been converted by the second,"" the Guardian added. ""The writing; the performances; the verisimilitude. Fleabag will be a tough act for Waller-Bridge to follow."" TheDaily Mail's Jan Moir,externaldubbed it ""absolutely the perfect ending"", adding that Waller-Bridge ""gave us a finale that was redemptive, unsentimental and beautiful"". She added: ""Not even a Christmas special? I don't think we are ready to say goodbye for ever to this wonderful character just yet."" Fleabag star on being a 'bad feminist' How to make people laugh by Phoebe Waller-Bridge Meanwhile, on social media, viewers were also left bowled over by the ending. One fan said,externalthey were so impressed with one of the character's speeches in the final scenes, that they ""typed it out"" and ""might even print it out and put it in a frame"". Others tweeted that they had watched the final episode twice consecutively, and many said the finale had left them in tears. English actor Samuel Barnett tweeted that Waller-Bridge was his ""hero"".

"Sports facilities have been built on part of the former steelworks A multi-million pound boost for plans to redevelop the former Ravenscraig steelworks site in North Lanarkshire has been agreed. Funding of Â£66m from the Glasgow Region City Deal will be used for a massive road development. Much of the site - which is bigger than Monaco - has already been developed, but a significant part is derelict. The site owners also want to create thousands of new homes and five primary schools. Part of the wider plans to improve the area's infrastructure will see new and upgraded roads from the M74 at Motherwell - through Ravenscraig, to the M8 at Eurocentral, and onward past Airdrie - on a new link road to the A73 south of Cumbernauld. The council has already agreed an extra Â£30m to be spent building new roads in the area and upgrading existing ones. The City Deal money will be used to finance the remainder of the plans. The eight regional council leaders who will benefit from the plans met on Tuesday to discuss moving the additional funds from existing North Lanarkshire projects into the Ravenscraig steelworks site project. Because the City Deal funding is for projects covering the wider Glasgow City region, other local councils had to back the move. Not all of the ambitious plans for the site have been realised Councillor Paul Kelly, deputy leader of North Lanarkshire Council, said the Ravencraig regeneration was of ""major strategic and economic importance"". He said a Lanarkshire roads project, which will cost more than Â£200m, would be ""the biggest single roads and infrastructure investment in North Lanarkshire's history"". He added that it would bring ""significant"" jobs and investment. He said it would bring 6,500 jobs and generate Â£360m for the local economy. He continued: ""It's vital that we focus on those projects that offer the best return on investment for our communities, our economy and for the future of North Lanarkshire."" Much of the Ravenscraig site has already been redeveloped - it includes a massive sports facility and a college. But a significant part is still derelict. Ravenscraig is one of Europe's largest brownfield regeneration sites and accounts for about an eighth of the Glasgow City Region's vacant and derelict land. Ravenscraig Ltd, who own the site, have a masterplan that will be considered by North Lanarkshire Council in the coming weeks. It includes plans for: 3,000 houses 19,000m2 of office space 63,000m2 of industrial space 30,000m2 of retail space Five primary schools and associated nursery provision Extension to the Ravenscraig Regional Sports Facility New 7 hectare town park The Â£1.13bn Glasgow City Region City Deal is an agreement between the UK government, Scottish government and eight local authorities across Glasgow and the Clyde Valley. The money is being used to fund major infrastructure projects and to boost employment. Other aims include improving public transport and connectivity and generating billions of pounds of private sector investment. The Scottish and UK governments, who have committed more than Â£500m each to the deal, welcomed the news. Scottish Secretary David Mundell said the UK government had ""an ambitious goal of creating jobs and opportunities and stimulating long-lasting growth for local communities"". He added: ""This project has the potential to transform Ravenscraig and will help to attract significant private sector investment to bring new homes and businesses to the site."" Michael Matheson, the Scottish government's infrastructure secretary, said: ""I am pleased to see North Lanarkshire Council and the wider Glasgow City Region continue to drive this deal forward and work together in the best interests of the regional economy.""

"Sana Muhammad, also known as Devi Unmathallegadoo, was eight months pregnant An ""obsessed"" man shot dead his heavily pregnant ex-wife with a crossbow in a ""deliberate and calculated act of revenge"", a court has heard. Prosecutors say Ramanodge Unmathallegadoo burst out of a garden shed in east London and attacked Sana Muhammad after plotting against her and her new partner for a year. The mother-of-five's baby survived, having been born by Caesarean section. Mr Unmathallegadoo denies murder and the attempted destruction of the baby. Prosecutor Peter Wright QC told jurors at the Old Bailey the defendant had ""not reacted well"" when his former partner began a new relationship. He allegedly watched the couple's home, making notes about the comings and goings of the family, and stored weaponry in the shed. Jurors heard that when his cache was discovered by a neighbour in March 2018 he set about replacing it - taking up position in the shed on the morning of 12 November armed with two new crossbows, bolts, a hammer, a knife, cable ties and duct tape. Ramanodge Unmathallegadoo allegedly stored weapons in the garden shed in Ilford The prosecution says his plan was to restrain his ex-wife and her partner and kill them and their unborn child but he was disturbed when the new partner went to the shed. The defendant chased him into the house in Ilford, carrying the two crossbows, and shot his ex-wife as she fled upstairs, the court heard. He was disarmed by two of the older children in the house and told them: ""It would have been easier if you guys weren't here, like I would have done it,"" the court heard. The court heard the 51-year-old defendant and his ex-wife - also known as Devi Unmathallegadoo - divorced in 2014, having had an arranged marriage.

"About 20 staff were attacked at Feltham Young Offenders Institution Thirteen prison officers had to be taken to hospital after being assaulted by teenagers at a young offenders institution (YOI), it has emerged. The officers were among about 20 staff attacked during an outbreak of violence at the weekend at Feltham YOI in west London. One officer suffered a broken nose and another was concussed after being repeatedly punched. The Prison Service said the assaults were ""completely unacceptable"". Several members of staff were bitten during the disturbance in the section of the YOI known as Feltham A which accommodates 150 boys, most of whom are aged 16 and 17. The other part of the facility, Feltham B, holds young offenders aged 18 to 21. Violence took place in the section of the YOI known as Feltham A A prison minibus was used to drive injured officers to hospital - they were all later discharged. The prisoners involved will face adjudication hearings in the next 72 hours and could be referred to the police. A Prison Service spokesperson said: ""We will never tolerate violence against our staff and will push for the strongest possible punishment, which could lead to them spending more time behind bars."" It also offered its sympathies to the ""hard-working and committed"" staff who were caught up in the violence. Feltham A manages young people on remand and those who have been sentenced by the courts Mark Fairhurst, chairman of the Prison Officers' Association (POA), said violence had been escalating at Feltham for a number of weeks partly due to changes in the way it deals with inmates who misbehave. Until December last year, they could be locked in a cell in the segregation block, known as the Care, Separation and Reintegration Unit, which is located in Feltham B. But after the High Court ruled in 2017 that a 16-year-old had been held unlawfully in the block, and inspectors described the regime there as ""impoverished"" and ""punitive"", its use for younger boys was reduced and eventually stopped. Mr Fairhurst criticised the decision saying the lack of effective punishments for the most challenging prisoners was putting staff at risk. ""We shouldn't be afraid to use sanctions,"" he said. He tweeted that the POA would ""support staff and push for prosecutions"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

His members held meetings outside the jail on Monday to discuss their concerns and had talks with the Governor. As an alternative to segregation, a new section in Feltham A, known as the Falcon Unit, began operating in March to give the most challenging boys extra support. The Prison Service said it would contain ""calm down"" rooms by the end of the month. Last month, the Independent Monitoring Board, which carries out regular visits to Feltham, warned the government that it needed to take ""urgent measures"" to make Feltham safer after a rise in gang-related violence. In its annual report it said: ""It is clear from talking to prisoners and staff that many prisoner-on-prisoner assaults and multi-prisoner fights are 'organised' and happen as a result of gang activity on the outside.""

"Theresa May is holding last-minute Brexit talks with the French President Emmanuel Macron, with the UK due to leave the EU in three days' time. The UK PM will urge Mr Macron to back her request to delay Brexit again until 30 June, having earlier met German Chancellor Angela Merkel in Berlin. After the talks, Ms Merkel said a delay that runs to the end of the year or the start of 2020 was a possibility. There is a summit on Wednesday when all EU states will vote on an extension. Cross-party talks in Westminster aimed at breaking the impasse in Parliament finished, with both sides expressing hope there would be progress. A draft EU document circulated to diplomats ahead of the emergency meeting of EU leaders proposes an extension but leaves the date blank. The BBC's Brussels correspondent Adam Fleming said the document refers to an extension lasting ""only as long as is necessary and, in any event, no longer than XX.XX.XXXX and ending earlier if the Withdrawal Agreement is ratified"". European Council president Donald Tusk said there was ""little reason to believe"" that the ratification process of the withdrawal agreement could be completed by the end of June. In a letter to EU leaders, he said at Wednesday's summit members should discuss ""an alternative, longer extension"" that will be flexible and ""would last only as long as necessary and no longer than one year"". Live updates: MPs debate EU sanctions after Brexit Kuenssberg: Significant hurdles for cross-party talks Adler: EU keen to quiz May ahead of Brexit summit The UK is currently due to leave the EU at 23:00 BST on Friday. Downing Street said Mrs May and Ms Merkel discussed the UK's request for an extension of Article 50 - the process by which the UK leaves the EU - to 30 June, with the option to bring this forward if a deal is ratified earlier. The prime minister and Chancellor Merkel agreed ""on the importance of ensuring Britain's orderly withdrawal"", a statement said. This video can not be played There was no-one to greet the PM as she arrived to meet the German chancellor for Brexit talks in Berlin Ms Merkel said EU leaders would discuss a ""flextension"" - a one-year flexible extension - at Wednesday's summit. Following a meeting of the EU's General Affairs Council in Luxembourg, diplomats said ""slightly more than a handful"" of member states spoke in favour of a delay to 30 June and a majority were in favour of a longer extension. Adam Fleming said no maximum end extension date was agreed, although December 2019 and March 2020 were mentioned. Conditions of a delay were discussed including UK participation in May's European Parliament elections, no re-opening of the withdrawal agreement and how to guarantee the UK's pledge of ""sincere co-operation"" in ongoing EU business. So far, MPs have rejected the withdrawal agreement Mrs May reached with other European leaders last year. One of most contentious parts of the plan is the Irish backstop - an insurance policy that aims to prevent a hard border returning to the island of Ireland. This video can not be played Andrea Leadsom: Merkel should reopen withdrawal deal The EU has continually said it will not re-open the withdrawal agreement for negotiations, but Leader of the Commons Andrea Leadsom renewed her plea for them to look again.

Meanwhile, Environment Secretary Michael Gove said cross-party talks aimed at breaking the impasse in Parliament had been ""open and constructive"", but the two sides differed on a ""number of areas"". Labour's shadow business secretary Rebecca Long Bailey said they were ""hopeful progress will be made"" and discussions with the government will continue in the ""coming days"". Further talks are due to be held on Thursday. In a leaked letter seen by the Telegraph,external, International Trade Secretary Liam Fox has warned that agreeing with Labour over its demand for a customs union is the ""worst of both worlds"" and will leave Britain unable to set its own trade policy. Brexit explained in flowcharts A really simple guide to Brexit Brexit Basics: The customs union On Tuesday afternoon, MPs approved a government motion asking MPs to approve the PM's request to the EU to delay Brexit, required aftera bill from Labour's Yvette Cooper became law. Please upgrade your browser to view this interactive Enter a postcode, or the name or constituency of your MP  The final decision on an extension lies with the EU - and the leaders of all the 27 other EU countries have to decide whether to grant or reject an extension. If the UK is still a member of the EU on 23 May, it will have to take part in European Parliamentary elections. Luxembourg's Foreign Minister Jean Asselborn said the UK would ""certainly not"" leave without a deal on Friday. But Ireland's Deputy Prime Minister Simon Coveney said a no-deal Brexit was still possible - even though it would represent ""an extraordinary failure of politics"". EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier said the EU has ""hope and expectation"" from the cross-party talks happening in Westminster and he would be willing to ""improve"" the political declaration ""within hours"". EU leaders are curious to hear the prime minister's Plan B. They hope there is one, although they're not convinced. They want to know, if they say yes to another Brexit extension, what it will be used for. And they suspect Theresa May wants them to do her dirty work for her. EU diplomatic sources I have spoken to suggest the prime minister may have officially asked the EU for a short new extension (until 30 June) as that was politically easier for her back home, whereas she believed and hoped (the theory goes) that EU leaders will insist instead on a flexible long extension that she actually needs. The bottom line is: EU leaders are extremely unlikely to refuse to further extend the Brexit process.

This could include the option of holding a public vote on any deal agreed by Parliament.

"Zain Qaiser scammed visitors to pornography sites around the world A student who made hundreds of thousands of pounds blackmailing pornography website users with cyber attacks has been jailed. Zain Qaiser from Barking, London, used his programming skills to scam visitors to pornography sites around the world. Investigators have discovered about Â£700,000 of his profits - but his network may have made more than Â£4m. Qaiser, 24, was jailed for more than six years at Kingston Crown Court. The court heard he is the most prolific cyber criminal to be sentenced in the UK. Judge Timothy Lamb QC said: ""The harm caused by your offending was extensive - so extensive that there does not appear to be a reported case involving anything comparable."" His jail sentence of six years and five months is a second major success for the National Crime Agency (NCA) after the jailing earlier this year ofa British man who broke an entire nation's internet. Qaiser was first arrested almost five years ago - but the case has been delayed because of the complexity of the investigation and mental health concerns. Scam: Qaiser tricked users into thinking they were going to be prosecuted Initially working from his bedroom at his family home in Barking, Qaiser began to make money through ""ransomware"" attacks when he was only 17 years old. This is a form of attack in which a computer is hijacked and frozen by a small piece of software until the user pays a fee for its release. Millions of these attacks occur every day around the world - the most well-known example in the UK isthe ""Wannacry"" attack on the NHS in 2017. Qaiser contacted the Russian controller of one of the most potent attack tools and agreed a split of his profits if his planned blackmail operation was a success. In turn, he forged contacts with online criminals from China and the USA to help shift the cash. Qaiser was filmed cashing in some of his money at a casino Over 18 months, the teenager posed as a legitimate supplier of online promotions and booked advertising space on some of the world's most popular legal pornography websites. But each of the adverts that was promoted on the websites contained a malicious tool called the ""Angler"". Any visitor to the adult site who clicked on one of Qaiser's fake adverts would trigger the download to their own computer of the attack kit. If the home computer was not protected with up-to-date anti-virus software, the Angler would search for vulnerabilities and, if possible, deliver the ""ransomware"" that seized control of the machine. It immediately splashed a full screen message to the user, purportedly from the FBI and other law enforcement agencies, accusing the user of breaking the law - warning them they faced up to three years unless they paid an immediate fine equivalent to roughly $200 or Â£100. ""Out of fear of embarrassment from friends or family members discovering they had accessed pornography, many users paid the ransom,"" prosecutor Joel Smith told Kingston Crown Court. ""For obvious reasons very few people complained to law enforcement officials."" FBI scam: Victims saw a different bogus law enforcement page depending on their location To make thing worse, the warning page claimed that police had captured webcam images of the user during their visit to the adult website - and gave a deadline for the payment to be made. The National Crime Agency says that it's impossible to know exactly how many people paid up - but forensic data has revealed Qaiser's operation was enormous. One screen grab from his control system reveals that he made Â£11,000 in July 2014 alone. Qaiser's ""control panel"" showed his ransom demands hit 16,000 PCs in just one month In a sampling exercise, the NCA calculated just one of the fake adverts appeared on 21 million web browsers every month - including 870,000 appearances on pornography pages accessed in the UK. In turn, the attack kit would have been downloaded on approximately 165,000 PCs. Some 5% of those - about 8,000 users - were likely to have fallen victim to the ransom demand. Financial investigators have established that Qaiser's operations shifted at least Â£4m through a string of crypto-currency platforms - although a great deal of these profits were ploughed back into the scam by buying more and more advertising space. The NCA's financial investigators identified that the former computer sciences student had personally received almost Â£550,000 by the time of his arrest. During the lengthy investigation while he was on bail, detectives found he received a further Â£100,000 as his associates moved funds through Gibraltar and Belize to a UK-accessible online account. Qaiser is believed to have more stashed in online crypto-currencies because he revealed in online chats that he has further ""offshore savings"". He was also filmed in an internet cafe Mike Hulett, head of cyber investigations at the National Crime agency, said: ""We regard Zain Qaiser as probably the most significant cyber crime offender that the NCA has investigated. ""The sheer volume and complexity of the actions - the number of people he is connected with worldwide and the frequency of his operation made it so successful and led to him making the money that he did. ""I don't think we will ever know the true number of people who paid up."" During his offending, Qaiser had no legal income - but he maintained a high-rolling lifestyle. He spent almost Â£5,000 on a Rolex watch and Â£2,000 on a stay in a Chelsea hotel. He regularly spent money on prostitutes, drugs and gambling, including almost Â£70,000 in a casino in an upmarket shopping centre. While it appears that no users of adult websites directly alerted police anywhere in the world, the advertising brokers who unwittingly placed Qaiser's malware promotions did. When a Canadian company selling advertising space asked Qaiser to stop, he launched a massive cyber attack against it, causing hundreds of thousands of pounds worth of damage to the business. ""Really, it's just better if we work together,"" warned Qaiser in one message to the broker. ""We can make some serious money together. It's my way or no way. The K!NG is back."" The Canadian company contacted police. Elizabeth Lambert, defending, said that Qaiser had suffered from bouts of mental illness and was influenced by older, more experienced organised cyber criminals. Qaiser initially denied the crimes and claimed he had been hacked, before pleading guilty to 11 charges - including blackmail, fraud, computer offences and possessing criminal property. The ransomware offences were committed between 2012 and 2014.

"This video can not be played Near misses on Highlands roads captured in dashcam footage Dashcam footage has emerged of drivers narrowly avoiding head-on crashes with cars being driven on the wrong side of roads in the Highlands. The videos have been uploaded to social media amid a local campaign to remind tourists to drive on the left. Sharon Anslow set up the Keep Left campaign after she was injured in a crash with a tourist's car in Skye in December last year. Police Scotland and MSP Kate Forbes are backing Ms Anslow's safety drive. Crash survivor in 'keep left' campaign The dashcam footage, believed to show tourists from overseas, was taken by drivers as they drove on Highland roads in day-time and in darkness. In the videos, cars can be seen coming head-on on the wrong side of the road, including at a corner in the dark. A head-on collision narrowly avoided on a Highlands road Ms Anslow said she tried to avoid a car on the wrong side of the road while she drove to work in Portree on 29 December. Her car was pushed into a ditch by the side of the road. She was freed from the wreckage by firefighters and suffered bruising and a sprained ankle in the crash. The other driver involved received a fixed penalty notice following the accident. Ms Anslow drives past the scene of her accident almost every day. She told BBC Scotland: ""It's terrifying. I relive the moment all the time and try to figure out if I could have done anything differently, but I couldn't have done."" Sharon Anslow said other people had told her of near misses on Highlands roads After the accident, other people told her of similar incidents, leading to her setting up the Keep Left campaign to improve safety on roads across the Highlands. Ms Anslow said: ""So many people contacted me after my accident saying: 'It happened to us'. Even earlier that day of my accident it had happened to somebody else. ""I really felt like I had to make a good thing out of a bad thing."" She said the campaign was not about ""knocking tourism"" in the Highlands, but trying to make the roads safer for everyone - both visitors and residents. It is calling for: clearer road markings signs at junctions and for hire car companies to place ""keep left"" stickers inside their vehicles. Local police, councillors and MSP Ms Forbes have been working on the campaign. Portree-based Sgt Bruce Crawford, of Police Scotland, said given the large numbers of visitors attracted to Skye and the wider Highlands area the number of accidents was low. But he said some of the accidents that did occur were serious. Ms Anslow was freed from the wreckage of her car by firefighters Sgt Crawford said: ""Quite often these collisions are caused by inattention, people who are probably spending time looking at the scenery as opposed to paying attention to the road. ""We want to urge people to take that bit more time looking at the landscape while the car is stopped, and then getting back into the car driving mode when they have got back into the car and back on the road."" Ms Forbes, SNP MSP for Skye, Lochaber and Badenoch, has called on Highland Council, Transport Scotland and VisitScotland to help in the effort to improve road safety. She said: ""As a frequent driver in the Highlands, footage of cars driving on the wrong side of the road is a matter of concern. ""There are no easy fixes and that's why I've taken a number actions since the Keep Left campaign was launched."" She added: ""There is a need for additional signage and road lines, so long as it does not clutter the road and risk additional distractions. ""Highland Council committed to doing that before the tourist season and Transport Scotland have agreed to meet me in the Highlands at the peak of the season."" Highland Council said improved road markings were to be added to 18 miles (28km) of its roads, including Skye's A863 Sligachan-Dunvegan, A850 Borve- Dunvegan and A855 Portree road.

"Laleh Shahravesh was arrested in Dubai when she arrived with her daughter, Paris, for her ex-husband's funeral The daughter of a British woman who is facing prison in Dubai for calling her ex-husband's new wife a ""horse"" on Facebook has pleaded for her release. Laleh Shahravesh, 55, was arrested at Dubai airport after flying to the city to attend her ex-husband's funeral. Her daughter, Paris, has written to Dubai's ruler saying she has not seen her mother in more than three weeks. ""I ask kindly: please, please return my mother's passport, and let her come home,"" said the 14-year-old. The Foreign Office said it was supporting mother-of-one Ms Shahravesh. Ms Shahravesh, from Richmond in south-west London, was married to her Portuguese husband Pedro for 18 years, according to campaign group Detained in Dubai which is working to get her released. The couple lived together in Dubai for eight months - where Pedro worked for HSBC - before Ms Shahravesh returned alone to the UK with the couple's daughter. Paris says she and her mother were ""intermittently yelled at"" by police In 2016, she received divorce papers and discovered on Facebook that Pedro was remarrying. Writing in Farsi on Facebook, Ms Shahravesh said: ""I hope you go under the ground you idiot. Damn you. You left me for this horse."" In another post, she wrote: ""You married a horse you idiot."" Ms Shahravesh was arrested in Dubai, part of the United Arab Emirates (UAE), on 10 March after travelling there for Pedro's funeral following his death from a heart attack at the age of 51. Under the UAE's cyber-crime laws, a person can be jailed or fined for making defamatory statements on social media. Detained in Dubai said Ms Shahravesh could be sentenced to up to two years in prison or fined Â£50,000, despite the fact she wrote the social media posts while in the UK. The organisation said Ms Shahravesh's ex-husband's new wife, who lives in Dubai, had reported the comments. On Monday,an open letter was published online,externalfrom the couple's daughter, Paris Shahravesh Correia Dos Santos, to the prime minister of the United Arab Emirates, Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, who is also the ruler of Dubai. She claimed that police shouted at her crying mother, who she said was ""given no choice"" but to sign a document that she did not understand. Paris said she had to leave Dubai without her mother Paris said: ""I cannot emphasise enough how scared I felt, especially after losing my father just a week before, as I was having to worry about losing my mother as well. ""Yet even though I felt terrified on the day that we arrived, the sick feeling in my stomach only became worse."" She added: ""I have not seen my mother in 23 days, and with every passing day, I feel less hopeful of her return."" The chief executive of Detained in Dubai, Radha Stirling, said the complainant has since written on Facebook that she is considering dropping the charges and retracting her statement out of respect for Paris. Earlier, Ms Stirling told BBC News that both her organisation and the Foreign Office (FCO) had asked the complainant to withdraw the allegation, but she had refused. According to Ms Stirling, her client Ms Shahravesh had been bailed but her passport had been confiscated and she was currently living in a hotel. UAE 'fines' suspicious phone-check wife UAE spy-accused recovery will 'take years' Ms Stirling added that ""no-one would really be aware"" of the severity of cyber-crime laws in the UAE, and the FCO had failed to adequately warn tourists about them. The FCO said in a statement: ""Our staff are supporting a British woman and her family following her detention in the UAE. ""We are in contact with the UAE authorities regarding her case."" Meanwhile during a trip to meet EU leaders in Luxembourg, Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt told reporters that the government was ""concerned"" by the situation. ""Our diplomats in the UAE have enormous experience in dealing with consular cases as we saw fromthe Matthew Hedges caseand so she is getting the best possible service from the FCO,"" he said. Durham University PhD student Mr Hedges was pardoned last year after intense diplomatic pressure and a campaign for his release by his wife, Daniela Tejada. He had previously been accused of spying for the UK and jailed for life in an Abu Dhabi court. Ms Shahravesh faces further court proceedings on Thursday. She said: ""I am terrified. I can't sleep or eat. I have gone down two dress sizes because of the stress. ""And my daughter cries herself to sleep every night. We are so close, especially since her father left us and we only have each other. It breaks my heart to be kept apart from her."" She has previously spoken about her Facebook comments, saying: ""I reacted badly. I lashed out and wrote two unpleasant comments about his new wife on his Facebook page.""

"Simon Clark ""lived life his own way"", his family said A man who stabbed his neighbour to death on a caravan park during a fight has been jailed for life. Steven Baxter, 52, went on the run after killing 54-year-old Simon Clark at Grove Caravan Park, Pendine, Carmarthenshire, on 28 September. He evaded capture for a month but was found by police living in a tent two miles from the murder scene. Mr Clark's mother said her ""whole life had been torn apart"" by her son's ""brutal killing"". Baxter was convicted of murderby a majority verdict at Swansea Crown Court on Monday. The judge Mr Justice Picken sentenced Baxter to life with a minimum term of 24 years on Tuesday afternoon. Baxter's trial had heard he and another man, Jeffrey Ward, who was cleared of murder, had attacked Mr Clark but it had been Baxter who ""inflicted the fatal wound upon him"". Mr Ward's partner Julie Harris, who pleaded guilty to perverting the course of justice at an earlier hearing, was sentenced at the same time as Baxter to 14 months suspended for two years. The month-long hunt for a fleeing killer Man guilty of caravan park murder This video can not be played A man who stabbed his neighbour to death on a caravan park has been jailed for life. Baxter and Mr Ward had gone on the run together after the stabbing, leaving Mr Clark ""to die where he fell"", still clutching a metal pole. The three men were neighbours at the caravan park and were involved in growing cannabis that many people at the site smoked, the court was told. In victim impact statements read out to the court, Mr Clark's mother, Meg Clark, said her ""whole life had been torn apart"" by her son's ""brutal"" killing. She said her son had been a ""deeply caring, loving father"" to his three children and grandchildren. Mr Clark's partner Sarah Stockwell said Baxter had not deserved to be living outside of prison. Steven Baxter was caught after a month on the run living in a tent Steven Baxter lived in a number of locations including a tent while on the run The court had heard he had been living in Carmarthenshire for the past eight years as part of attempts to hide from police after a suspected serious domestic incident against his former wife. ""I have no words to sum up the devastation Simon's death has caused,"" she wrote. ""I hope he (Baxter) never sees the outside again."" Mr Justice Picken said despite a previous fight that evening between Mr Clark and Mr Ward, Baxter could have no excuses for his actions. ""You and you alone were to blame for his death,"" he said. ""You were the aggressor. In truth you should never have picked up that knife."" He said Baxter had refused to show any remorse for what he did throughout the trial. Baxter had refused to take his place in court for the sentencing. Simon Clark's caravan (l) was next door to Steven Baxter's In a statement, Mr Clark's family said: ""Simon was a deeply caring and loving father to Jemma and his two sons aged 12 and 9. ""He loved 'life' and lived it in his own way, always caring and supportive to all his friends, especially those needing extra support to deal with illness and disability. He was a Samaritan to all. ""He told us often 'I am the richest man in the world because Jemma and my boys are my precious treasures'. He was so very proud when Jemma and Tim presented him over the past three years with two beautiful grandchildren. ""His family, his partner and all his friends, cannot believe the evil gesture that has taken Simon from us."" They thanked the police and prosecutors for their support and ""unfailing diligence"" in pursuing justice for Mr Clark. Det Ch Insp Paul Jones, senior investigating officer, expressed his sympathy for Mr Clark's family, adding: ""I hope this verdict will demonstrate to them that justice has been served, and the sentence will be a deterrent to anyone thinking of carrying knives.""

"Ailing department store chain Debenhams has been rescued by its lenders after falling into administration. Three years ago, the 166-strong chain was worth Â£900m, compared with Â£20m as of this week. It's been one of the main draws of High Streets - and later, shopping centres - for years, and it has a venerable history. Its origins go back to 1778, when King George III was on the throne, when it opened as a drapers' store in central London. It expanded over the years and became a global business, with offices in South Africa, Australia, Canada and China. At one point, it owned upmarket department store Harvey Nichols. By 1950, Debenhams was the largest department store group in the UK, with 110 stores.Debenhams: Three things that went wrong Debenhams joined the stock market, for the third time, in 2006, with a worth of Â£1.7bn. Its share price hit 207p one day later - a level that it has never bettered since. We take a look at the key factors behind its demise. With hindsight, Debenhams' timing could hardly have been worse. Fashion is cyclical, but a new trend was beginning that turned out to be a game-changer. Laith Kalif at stockbrokers Hargreaves Lansdown (HL) points out that a year after Debenhams floated in 2006, the iPhone was launched. That was a key element in the transformation of the way we shop for goods, helping the rush to online shopping with the extra ease and functionality of the app. Debenhams, of course, isn't alone in failing to see the future. Robert Hayton, from property adviser Altus Group, says that since 2010, almost a third of department stores in England and Wales have disappeared. They have ended up being converted for other types of use, split into smaller units or even demolished as the sector adapts to this fundamental structural change. As the shift to online grew and became entrenched, Debenhams remained a laggard compared with others, notably arch-rival John Lewis. Although not the only retail chain to fail to predict the future, the consistent lack of response to the unfolding trends eventually did for Debenhams, says Richard Lim from analysts Retail Economics. He says: ""Put simply, the business has been outmanoeuvred by more nimble competitors, failed to embrace change and was left with a tiring proposition. The industry is evolving fast and it paid the ultimate price."" On top of that, management failed to maintain the historic brand itself, says Simon Reynolds from branding consultancy Landor: ""It's a case of 'another one bites the dust' as the 240-year-old business falls into the hands of its lenders. ""Ultimately, Debenhams failed to establish a clear brand proposition for its customers. It couldn't demonstrate what made it different to its competitors and it lacked relevance to younger customers."" In 2006, Debenhams stuck fast to its expansion plans, seemingly unaware of changing trends. At that time, it had 120 stores and planned to double the number, piling on the costs as it became increasingly out of step with shoppers' buying habits. Hargreaves Lansdown says it managed to keep shoppers interested by eye-catching promotions, including its Blue Cross days, which featured generous discounting. Richard Hyman: ""The fundamental fact is its lack of relevance."" But the stockbroker says that came at the expense of profits: ""The problem with regular discounting is it becomes a self-propagating strategy. ""If customers are used to getting goods at a knock-down price, they hold off buying until there's a sale on."" Veteran independent retail consultant Richard Hyman says the heart of the matter is lack of relevance: ""It simply doesn't sell enough product. It's not sufficiently relevant. It isn't clear who it is targeting. That is the key issue - its relevance as a business. ""If you solved the immediate property problems, you'd still be left with the fundamental fact: it doesn't have enough sales. Its sales are static."" The weakening pound in the wake of the EU referendum also didn't help matters, increasing the cost of stocking the shelves with overseas goods. This physical expansion brought with it the soaring costs that have unhorsed so many other bricks-and-mortar retailers. Altus says these prime-sited large properties came with big rents, high rates and onerous lease liabilities, as well as large staffing needs and leases that were difficult to give up, All that ""conspired to create a beast that was unable to adapt in a fast-changing retail environment"". Altus says the revaluation of business rates in 2017 has seen the average rates bill for a large department store rise to Â£642,852 this year. That's up 26.9%, or Â£132,378, compared with the year before the revaluation came into effect. Hargreaves Lansdown says Debenhams stores have an average lease term of 18 years, while the department store currently has Â£4.3bn of minimum lease payments over the next 20-plus years under current arrangements. All these costs were rising while footfall through the shops and profit margins were falling, almost halving from 19% in 2006 to 10% today, according to Hargreaves Lansdown. Although revenues were higher than in 2011, when profit before tax peaked at Â£160.3m, last year Debenhams posted a pre-tax loss of Â£491.5m.

"Mike Ashley owns more than 60% of Sports Direct Sports Direct says Debenhams has rejected its offer to inject Â£150m into the troubled department store chain. Retail tycoon Mike Ashley tabled the rescue bid on the condition that he be made chief executive of Debenhams. He has been locked in an acrimonious battle with Debenhams' board for control of the business and has accused its executives of ""a sustained programme of falsehoods and denials"". Debenhams' rejection means it is likely to go into administration this week. The firm is set to go through a pre-pack administration, which would mean current shareholders - including Mr Ashley who owns nearly 30% of the chain - would be wiped out. While the shops would continue trading for now, Debenhams has proposed closing around 50 branches from next year and renegotiating rents with landlords to tackle its funding problems. In a statement, Sports Direct said it was ""disappointed"" with the response to its proposal to raise Â£150m by issuing new shares, which would also have seen lenders write off Â£148m of the chain's debt. But the retailer said it was still giving ""active consideration"" to a separate offer, first proposed in March, to take over Debenhams by purchasing existing shares. It's been an extraordinary tussle for control of Debenhams. Barring a last minute twist, Mike Ashley has found himself on the losing side. His latest 11th hour proposal has been rejected by lenders. The retailer doesn't have much choice. It has Â£560m of debt and its creditors are now effectively calling the shots. Despite nearly Â£3bn of sales last year, the business is now worth less than Â£30m as its share price has crashed to less than 2p. The board believes the best option is to be rescued by its lenders. This is set to take the form of a pre-pack administration. An announcement could come as early as Tuesday. It will be business as usual for its shops and staff. But store closures down the line are inevitable. Debenhams has already said it needed to shut 50 stores in the coming years. That plan will now be accelerated, with up to 20 expected to go in early 2020 through a restructuring process with landlords. On Sunday, in its latest swipe at Debenhams management, Sports Direct called for an investigation and for the firm's shares to be suspended. A strongly-worded statement accused Debenhams' board members of misrepresenting what had happened in a meeting between the two firms andurged them to undergo lie detector tests. The struggling department store, which has 165 stores and employs about 25,000 people,reported a record pre-tax loss of Â£491.5m last year. If Mr Ashley does gain control of Debenhams, he would control yet another High Street name. As well as Sports Direct, Mr Ashley runs House of Fraser, Evans Cycles and Flannels. In January, Mr Ashley joined investor Landmark Group to vote the chairman and chief executive of Debenhams off the board. High Street retailers have been under increasing pressure as more people choose to shop online and visit stores less. Debenhams secures Â£200m lifeline Can Mike Ashley save debt-laden Debenhams?

"Thirteen people filed for divorce on Christmas Day in England and Wales, official figures show. They were among 455 online divorce applications submitted to HM Courts & Tribunals Service between Christmas Eve and New Year's Day. Twenty-six people submitted applications on Christmas Eve, 23 on Boxing Day and 77 on New Year's Day. Since April 2018 spouses have been able to complete the divorce application process using the internet. Instead of sending paperwork, people can fill in applications, upload the documents needed and pay fees online. Figures released by the Ministry of Justice (MoJ) show more than 23,000 online divorce applications have been made since the platform was introduced. 'I was married and divorced in my 20s' Reality Check: Are we living happily ever after? Divorce rates for opposite-sex couples in England and Wales are at their lowest level since 1973, according to the latest figurespublished by the Office for National Statistics,external. In 2017 there were 101,669 divorces of opposite-sex couples in England and Wales, a decrease of 5% on the previous year. There were 338 divorces of same-sex couples in 2017, more than three times the number in 2016. However, same-sex marriages have only been possible in England and Wales since March 2014. Ammanda Major, from relationship support charity Relate, said her organisation typically saw an increase in requests for help in January. ""Many people hope that the festive period will be a time of coming together, so when this doesn't happen the sense of failure and sadness can further exacerbate problems that were there in the first place,"" she said. ""Pressures can build up when people are spending an extended period of time together. ""For some people it might be the additional financial pressure of Christmas that triggers a problem, while for others it could be the stress of trying to keep everyone from the in-laws to the children happy."" When you apply for a divorce you must prove your marriage has broken down and give one of the following reasons: Adultery Unreasonable behaviour Desertion You have lived apart for more than two years and both agree to the divorce You have lived apart for at least five years, even if your husband or wife disagrees Source: Gov.UK The introduction of ""fully digital"" divorces is part of a Â£1bn plan to modernise the justice system. The MoJ said more than 150,000 people had used online justice services in 2018, taking the total to more than 300,000 in the past four years. This included to lodge civil money claims, for probate applications, personal independence payment appeals and pleas in fare evasion cases and low level-motoring offences. Justice minister Lucy Frazer said: ""These online services are already making a difference to people who use the justice system."" ""As we reach this milestone, it's encouraging to see people are reporting these services work well for them and are a better fit around their busy lives."" The MoJ said the services do not replace existing paper-based applications, but provide a quicker, easier service for many people.

"Tini Owens has been refused a divorce by the family court and Court of Appeal A woman who wants to divorce her husband on the grounds she is unhappy has lost her Supreme Court appeal. Tini Owens, 68, from Worcestershire, wanted the court to grant her a divorce from her husband of 40 years Hugh, who is refusing the split. The Supreme Court unanimously rejected the appeal, meaning she must remain married until 2020. Mrs Owens' solicitor said she was ""devastated"" by the decision and ""cannot move forward with her life"". Midlands Live: Hit-and-run killer could have jail term increased; MP's warning over acid attacks Under the current law in England and Wales, unless people can prove their marriage has broken down due to adultery, unreasonable behaviour or desertion, the only way to obtain a divorce without a spouse's consent is to live apart for five years. Following the ruling, the Ministry of Justice said: ""The current system of divorce creates unnecessary antagonism in an already difficult situation. ""We are already looking closely at possible reforms to the system."" The couple were married in 1978 and have two adult children. Mrs Owens said she had been contemplating a divorce since 2012, but did not leave the matrimonial home until February 2015. Hugh Owens has refused to agree to a divorce Shealleged the marriage had broken down irretrievablyand Mr Owens had behaved in such a way that she could not reasonably be expected to live with him. Mr Owens, 80, has refused to agree to a divorce and denied Mrs Owens' allegations about his behaviour. He said if their marriage had irretrievably broken down it was because she'd had an affair, or because she was ""bored"". Supreme Court justices analysed rival legal arguments, which revolved around concepts of ""unreasonable"" behaviour and ""fault"", at a hearing in May and delivered a ruling on Wednesday. One, Lord Wilson, said justices had ruled against Mrs Owens ""with reluctance"" and it was a case for Parliament. Should it be easier to get a divorce? The blame game: Divorcing in the UK Reality Check: Are we living happily ever after? A statement made by Mr Owens' solicitors said he should not be ""unfairly criticised for attempting to save his marriage"". ""Hugh Owens takes no pleasure from this process which has impacted on the private family life of him and his wife,"" the statement said. Simon Beccle, Mrs Owens' solicitor, said she had hoped the justices would make a decision which would be ""forward-thinking and fit with the current social mores"". Supreme Court president Lady Halesaid she found the case ""very troubling"" but it was not for judges to ""change the law"". The original judge who heard the case found the marriage had broken down, but that Mrs Owens' examples were ""flimsy and exaggerated"". The pair have been living separately since 2015, Mrs Owens in Hill Farm House (left) and Mr Owens in Manor House (right) The case has sparked a debate about whether divorce laws in England and Wales need to change. Caroline Elliott, a partner at law firm Shakespeare Martineau, said: ""England and Wales currently lag far behind other countries with their divorce laws and there is a strong mood for reform, which includes the introduction of 'no-fault' divorces."" Rarely in the field of Supreme Court judgements has a ruling been given with such misgivings by so many. Lady Hale, the court's president, called it ""a very troubling case"". Lord Wilson and Lord Mance shared ""uneasy feelings"". Why? Because there is deep disquiet about a law that forces spouses to assign blame in order to get their divorce. Many believe blame only exacerbates the problems and conflicts inherent in what is already a difficult and stressful process. There have been calls for a move to a ""no-fault"" system for decades, like those that exist in the US, Australia and Scotland. A private members' bill has been introduced into Parliament by former family judge Baroness Butler-Sloss, seeking a review of the current law. However, there is little immediate chance of change in England and Wales. Mrs Owens' lawyers had suggested a ""modest shift"" of focus in interpretation of legislation was required. They argued she should not have had to prove Mr Owens' behaviour has been ""unreasonable"", only that she should not ""reasonably be expected"" to remain with him. Nigel Dyer QC, who led Mr Owens' legal team, disagreed and raised concerns about the introduction of divorce on ""demand"". One Supreme Court judge said she reached her conclusion with ""no enthusiasm whatsoever"" but that Parliament would have to decide whether to introduce ""no-fault"" divorce on demand. Another said Parliament had ""decreed"" that being in a ""wretchedly unhappy marriage"" was not a ground for divorce.

"This video can not be played Baroness Shackleton tells Today that marriage is 'not just about the heart' One of the UK's most famous divorce lawyers has backed a change in the law - but urged couples to be more practical about marriage. Baroness Fiona Shackleton called the current divorce law ""archaic"". Under the current system in England and Wales, a couple have to prove in court that their marriage has irretrievably broken down. She wants schools to help pupils view marriage as ""the most important decision they make"". ""It's not just about the heart,"" said the lawyer, who has represented Prince Charles and Sir Paul McCartney. ""It's a practical arrangement."" Baroness Shackleton, who is a solicitor to Princes William and Harry, at this year's royal wedding Baroness Shackleton,externalhas been a divorce lawyer for over 40 years and is also a solicitor to Princes William and Harry. She was made a life peer in 2010. She was speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme on Monday after a new study on divorce was published last week. The research, carried out at the University of Exeter and sponsored by Baroness Shackleton, suggested thatasking 10 questionsbefore starting a serious relationship can help couples stand the test of time. It comes in the wake of the case of Tini Owens, a woman who lost her Supreme Court appeal last week in her fight to divorce her husband. Mrs Owens, 68, wants a divorce on the ground she is unhappy but her husband Hugh has refused. Tini Owens has been refused a divorce by the family court and Court of Appeal Under the current law in England and Wales, unless people can prove their marriage has broken down due to adultery, unreasonable behaviour or desertion, the only way to obtain a divorce without a spouse's consent is to live apart for five years. Specialist lawyers have called for the introduction of a ""no-fault divorce"", which would have helped Mrs Owens. The 10 questions to ask before falling in love Should it be easier to get a divorce? The blame game: Divorcing in the UK Baroness Shackleton said that couples currently have to ""exaggerate or to agree"" to get a divorce. But she said ""it is no good just changing divorce laws to dissolve the marriage"" and that reform is also needed on laws around sorting out finances during a divorce. She issupporting a bill proposed,externalby her fellow peer Baroness Deech which could replace the current system for splitting money in divorce cases. Baroness Shackleton said she is supporting theUniversity of Exeter research,external""with a hope that education... will devote just a little time to get students to focus on what is the most important decision they make, which is basically who they breed with"". ""[Marriage] is a practical arrangement which has to survive to rear children,"" she said. ""And it's the children who are the very sad losers when parents are selfish and decide their own desires override those of their family."" She added: ""What I think should happen is that people should understand that when they are entering this commitment which is meant to be for life."" She said people should be ""aware of some of the traits that you can't change in people"". ""You can't make a mean person fundamentally generous,"" she said. ""You can't make a kind person fundamentally unkind. ""If they think about these things - not about the white dress or escape from home, or many other reasons, not the love element - [but] the practicality of marriage before entering into it, I'd probably be doing myself out of a job more often.""

"Theresa May is holding last-minute Brexit talks with the French President Emmanuel Macron, with the UK due to leave the EU in three days' time. The UK PM will urge Mr Macron to back her request to delay Brexit again until 30 June, having earlier met German Chancellor Angela Merkel in Berlin. After the talks, Ms Merkel said a delay that runs to the end of the year or the start of 2020 was a possibility. There is a summit on Wednesday when all EU states will vote on an extension. Cross-party talks in Westminster aimed at breaking the impasse in Parliament finished, with both sides expressing hope there would be progress. A draft EU document circulated to diplomats ahead of the emergency meeting of EU leaders proposes an extension but leaves the date blank. The BBC's Brussels correspondent Adam Fleming said the document refers to an extension lasting ""only as long as is necessary and, in any event, no longer than XX.XX.XXXX and ending earlier if the Withdrawal Agreement is ratified"". European Council president Donald Tusk said there was ""little reason to believe"" that the ratification process of the withdrawal agreement could be completed by the end of June. In a letter to EU leaders, he said at Wednesday's summit members should discuss ""an alternative, longer extension"" that will be flexible and ""would last only as long as necessary and no longer than one year"". Live updates: MPs debate EU sanctions after Brexit Kuenssberg: Significant hurdles for cross-party talks Adler: EU keen to quiz May ahead of Brexit summit The UK is currently due to leave the EU at 23:00 BST on Friday. Downing Street said Mrs May and Ms Merkel discussed the UK's request for an extension of Article 50 - the process by which the UK leaves the EU - to 30 June, with the option to bring this forward if a deal is ratified earlier. The prime minister and Chancellor Merkel agreed ""on the importance of ensuring Britain's orderly withdrawal"", a statement said. This video can not be played There was no-one to greet the PM as she arrived to meet the German chancellor for Brexit talks in Berlin Ms Merkel said EU leaders would discuss a ""flextension"" - a one-year flexible extension - at Wednesday's summit. Following a meeting of the EU's General Affairs Council in Luxembourg, diplomats said ""slightly more than a handful"" of member states spoke in favour of a delay to 30 June and a majority were in favour of a longer extension. Adam Fleming said no maximum end extension date was agreed, although December 2019 and March 2020 were mentioned. Conditions of a delay were discussed including UK participation in May's European Parliament elections, no re-opening of the withdrawal agreement and how to guarantee the UK's pledge of ""sincere co-operation"" in ongoing EU business. So far, MPs have rejected the withdrawal agreement Mrs May reached with other European leaders last year. One of most contentious parts of the plan is the Irish backstop - an insurance policy that aims to prevent a hard border returning to the island of Ireland. This video can not be played Andrea Leadsom: Merkel should reopen withdrawal deal The EU has continually said it will not re-open the withdrawal agreement for negotiations, but Leader of the Commons Andrea Leadsom renewed her plea for them to look again.

Meanwhile, Environment Secretary Michael Gove said cross-party talks aimed at breaking the impasse in Parliament had been ""open and constructive"", but the two sides differed on a ""number of areas"". Labour's shadow business secretary Rebecca Long Bailey said they were ""hopeful progress will be made"" and discussions with the government will continue in the ""coming days"". Further talks are due to be held on Thursday. In a leaked letter seen by the Telegraph,external, International Trade Secretary Liam Fox has warned that agreeing with Labour over its demand for a customs union is the ""worst of both worlds"" and will leave Britain unable to set its own trade policy.

Please upgrade your browser to view this interactive Enter a postcode, or the name or constituency of your MP  The final decision on an extension lies with the EU - and the leaders of all the 27 other EU countries have to decide whether to grant or reject an extension. If the UK is still a member of the EU on 23 May, it will have to take part in European Parliamentary elections. Luxembourg's Foreign Minister Jean Asselborn said the UK would ""certainly not"" leave without a deal on Friday. But Ireland's Deputy Prime Minister Simon Coveney said a no-deal Brexit was still possible - even though it would represent ""an extraordinary failure of politics"". EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier said the EU has ""hope and expectation"" from the cross-party talks happening in Westminster and he would be willing to ""improve"" the political declaration ""within hours"". EU leaders are curious to hear the prime minister's Plan B. They hope there is one, although they're not convinced. They want to know, if they say yes to another Brexit extension, what it will be used for. And they suspect Theresa May wants them to do her dirty work for her. EU diplomatic sources I have spoken to suggest the prime minister may have officially asked the EU for a short new extension (until 30 June) as that was politically easier for her back home, whereas she believed and hoped (the theory goes) that EU leaders will insist instead on a flexible long extension that she actually needs. The bottom line is: EU leaders are extremely unlikely to refuse to further extend the Brexit process.

"Debenhams is on the brink of administration after it rejected a new offer from Sports Direct, made in the early hours of Tuesday, to pump Â£200m into the department store. Its shares were then suspended before Tuesday's trading, at its own request. Debenhams is likely to go into pre-pack administration, under which shops would continue trading but the business would come under the control of its lenders. On Monday, it rejected a Â£150m offer from Mike Ashley's company. The overnight offer was turned down because Mr Ashley wanted to be chief executive. It would have seen Sports Direct underwrite the raising of Â£200m by issuing new shares, higher than its previous proposal. Debenhams rejects Mike Ashley's last-ditch rescue plan Debenhams secures Â£200m lifeline with lenders A pre-pack administration lets a company sell itself, or its assets, as a going concern, without affecting the operation of the business. Administrators take over the running of the business to protect creditors and shareholders lose their investments. If Debenhams does use a pre-pack administration, Mr Ashley's near 30% stake in the company, which cost about Â£150m to build up, would be wiped out. While the shops would continue trading for now, Debenhams has proposed closing around 50 branches from next year and renegotiating rents with landlords to tackle its funding problems. Debenhams has been struggling for a while and issued three profit warnings last year. It also has a debt pile of Â£640m. Towards the end of 2018, the chain announced it was increasing its store closure plans from 10 to 50 over a three to five-year period. The company said it was not ready to release a list of which shops may be affected. In February, it was revealed that the shutting of 20 of those stores could be brought forward if the retailer took out a company voluntary arrangement (CVA), a form of insolvency that can enable firms to seek rent cuts and close unwanted stores. Debenhams has 165 stores and employs around 25,000 people. Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said that Tuesday was set to ""mark the endgame for control of the department store"" and that the rejection of Sports Direct's overnight bid ""suggests that Debenhams simply isn't interested in what Sports Direct has to offer"". He added: ""It looks like Mike Ashley has one final card to play, and that's making a firm takeover offer for Debenhams. Even that seems unlikely to shift the retailer from the course it's currently on, as it sounds like the department store is preparing to enter administration imminently.""

"StepChange Scotland is calling for more work to be done to encourage people with money problems to seek help earlier Nearly 700,000 people in Scotland have problem debts or are at risk of having them, a charity report has warned. Debt advisory charity StepChange Scotland, which helped 30,000 people struggling with money issues last year, said council tax arrears were a problem for 46% of them. Its ""Scotland in the Red"" report said the cost to the public purse was Â£750m. The charity said those they helped had on average Â£12.64 a month after paying housing, heating and council tax. StepChange Scotland has called on local authorities to ensure they have ""sustainable arrangements"" that give people a ""fair chance"" to repay their debt. It also recommended the Scottish government task a minister with coordinating and developing a ""high impact action plan to address the crisis that is blighting many lives and businesses across Scotland"". Sharon Bell, head of StepChange Scotland, said she was ""increasingly alarmed by the increases in the proportion of our clients who are struggling with household bills, particularly council tax"". Research by the charity ""shows that our clients in Scotland are significantly more likely to have council tax arrears compared to elsewhere in the UK"", she added, with the average amount of council tax arrears being Â£2,017. Problem debts were ""primarily a symptom of poverty, poor housing conditions, welfare cuts, ill-health and insecure work"", the report said. StepChange Scotland estimated the social cost of problem debt amounts was about Â£750m, with public services having to deal with mental health problems caused and exacerbated by debt, and demand for housing help. The charity is also calling for more work to be done to encourage people with money problems to seek help earlier to minimise the harm debt can cause. A spokesman for the local government organisation Cosla said: ""Scotland's councils take this issue very seriously and do all that they can to help people who find themselves in arrears.

"Families have waited more than five years for an FAI to be held The pilot of the police helicopter that crashed into the Clutha pub, killing 10 people, had received five low fuel warnings, a fatal accident inquiry has heard. At 22:19 on 29 November 2013, David Traill, who was among those who died, had told air traffic control he was returning to Glasgow City Heliport. At 22:22, the Police Scotland helicopter crashed through the roof of Glasgow's Clutha bar. Thirty one people were also injured. The court heard that at the point Mr Traill said he was returning to the Clyde heliport from Bothwell, the helicopter was estimated to have 86kg of fuel on board. Marcus Cook, senior inspector of air accidents at the Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB), said that, as well as a warning unit, the pilot also had a screen known as a Caution and Advisory Display (CAD). It should have indicated the amount of fuel in the main tank, the left supply tank and the right supply tank. Mr Cook said: ""The evidence suggests the CAD was functioning at the time."" The helicopter's warning unit had two indicators of note in relation to the fuel. They were ""Low Fuel 1"", which related to the level of fuel in the    tank supplying the left engine, and ""Low Fuel 2"", which covered the right engine. During the final flight the court heard the pilot received and acknowledged five fuel warnings. The pilot received three intermittent Low Fuel 1 warnings before a fourth, which remained on for the rest of the flight. He also received a single Low Fuel 2 warning which he acknowledged. It also remained on for the remainder of the journey. Helicopter 'spluttered' before crashing on pub Clutha pilot flew on after fuel warning Follow the BBC's Paul O'Hare who is tweeting from the inquiry,external Mr Cook told the hearing he would have expected the pilot to make a PAN call - which would have indicated he had a fuel issue - ""long before the final stages of the flight"". He said: ""The one thing you always keep an eye on is how much fuel you have on board, how much endurance you have available."" He said that if a pilot believes he is going to go below final fuel reserve he should make a mayday call. The witness said police helicopter pilots had an ""acute fuel awareness"" due to the non-routine nature of their work. Mr Cook told the court that every time a fuel warning illuminated on the helicopter's dashboard it should have been accompanied by an ""audio gong"" which would be heard by anyone on board. The warning must be acknowledged and suppressed by pressing a button. He added that the pilot was instructed on the technicalities of the helicopter's fuel system during his initial conversion training in 2008. This included the requirement to land within 10 minutes of being presented with a low fuel warning. The court heard an excerpt from the AAIB report which noted that at the time of the accident in November 2013, the EC135 model of aircraft had accumulated more than three million flying hours over 20 years. It added: ""There had not previously been a reported instance of fuel starvation."" (Top: left to right) David Traill; PC Kirsty Nelis; PC Tony Collins; Gary Arthur; Samuel McGhee (Bottom: left to right) Colin Gibson; Robert Jenkins; Mark O'Prey; John McGarrigle; Joe Cusker Mr Cook said the pilot received three low rotor speed warnings and made some attempt to manage the rotor output before the crash. The FAI was told the warnings are triggered when the speed dips below 97% but if it drops below 75% it is ""irrecoverable"". Mr Cook agreed with Sean Smith QC that it would be an ""unusual event"" for a pilot to experience an engine flame out. Asked about the probability of a double engine flame out, the witness replied: ""More unusual"". And he agreed that David Traill was an experienced pilot and had spent 646 hours at the controls of an EC135 helicopter. At the time of the crash the helicopter had 76kg of fuel on board. Asked by Donald Findlay QC, who is representing the family of Robert Jenkins, if that would have been enough - under normal circumstances - for it to reach the Glasgow City Heliport, Mr Cook replied: ""Probably."" In October 2015a report from the AAIB,externalconcluded the pilot did not follow emergency protocol and flew on despite the low fuel warnings. It also found fuel transfer pumps were turned off and a controlled landing was not achieved for ""unknown reasons"". And it recommended that all police helicopters should be equipped with black box flight recording equipment. More than 100 people were in The Clutha when the Eurocopter EC 135, operated by Bond Air Services, crashed into the bar. Pilot David Traill, 51; PC Tony Collins, 43; and PC Kirsty Nelis, 36, lost their lives along with seven customers who were in the bar on Stockwell Street. They were Gary Arthur, 48; Joe Cusker, 59; Colin Gibson, 33; Robert Jenkins, 61; John McGarrigle, 58; Samuel McGhee, 56; and Mark O'Prey, 44. The second day of the hearing earlier heard that AAIB investigators had received nothing ""new or significant"" enough for the original investigation to be reopened despite being sent various documents over the years. Philip Sleight, deputy chief inspector of air accidents at the AAIB, told the court that the AAIB's purpose was to investigate the circumstances of an accident and make recommendations with the intention of preventing a reoccurrence. He said the focus of the AAIB was ""encouraging safety"" not ""apportioning blame"". This video can not be played Clutha helicopter crash: how the events unfolded Mr Findlay asked who the relatives could speak to about differences between the draft and final report. Mr Sleight said the differences could not be discussed because of regulations. Mr Findlay asked if the families of those who died just have to accept that. Mr Sleight replied ""yes"". Mr Sleight told the inquiry: ""It is quite normal for a report to change significantly between draft and final."" Mr Cook, who was part of the team that prepared the AAIB report, told the court about the communication on board helicopter. He said it was the responsibility of the pilot to liaise with Air Traffic Control. Separately, the Police Scotland Airwave system was used for operational purposes. He told the hearing both means of communication were recorded. Clutha survivor: 'Going back to pub helped my recovery' Clutha families 'punished again' over FAI The helicopter's last journey was traced by radar. It left Glasgow at 20:45 to respond to reports of someone being struck by a train at Oatlands. It then travelled to Dalkeith for a routine task before carrying out surveillance in Bothwell, Uddingston and Bargeddie. The FAI, which is being held in a temporary court at Hampden Park football ground, has now adjourned for the day and will resume on Wednesday. It is expected to hear about three months' worth of evidence between now and August but it will not sit every day. 29 November 2013: Police helicopter crashes on Clutha bar in Glasgow, killing 10 people. 9 December 2013: AAIB preliminary report finds there was 95 litres of fuel onboard the aircraft. 14 February 2014: AAIB special report finds both engines ""flamed out"".

"This video can not be played The ""Umbrella Movement"" activists said they would continue to strive for democracy Nine pro-democracy activists in Hong Kong have been found guilty of public nuisance charges for their role in a civil disobedience movement that called for free elections in the city. Among them are three prominent activists, seen as figureheads of Hong Kong's pro-democracy movement. They could be jailed for up to seven years for their part in the ""Umbrella Movement"" protests of 2014. Thousands marched demanding the right for Hong Kong to choose its own leader. Those convicted include the so-called ""Occupy trio"" - sociology professor Chan Kin-man, 60, law professor Benny Tai, 54, and Baptist minister Chu Yiu-ming, 75. They are seen as the founders of the movement that galvanised protesters in their campaign of civil disobedience. ""No matter what happens today... we will persist on and do not give up,"" Mr Tai told reporters ahead of the verdict. Mr Tai, Mr Chan and five others were found guilty of two charges of public nuisance,external, and Mr Chu and one other of just one charge. A large crowd gathered outside the court on Thursday to support them. It is not yet clear when they will be sentenced. Chu Yiu-ming, Benny Tai and Chan Kin-man (left to right) were charged under colonial-era laws that carry possible jail terms of up to seven years By Martin Yip, BBC News Chinese, Hong Kong The nine defendants walked into the court building looking refreshed and in high spirits. All but one said a few words in what might have been their last hours of freedom before their predicted jail term. Delivering his verdict, Justice Johnny Chan said the defendants had caused a nuisance - by occupying major roads - leading to injuries among civilians. The nine looked calm and not particularly emotional. They were later released on bail. Benny Tai, Chan Kin-man and Chu Yiu-ming smiled as they passed me, as if it was just another day. They are yet to say if they will appeal. The court was adjourned for the day as the lawyers are yet to finish their mitigation submissions. The sentences have yet to be announced. The broader pro-democracy camp already has bad relations with Beijing. Activists and politicians did express their anger but political analysts also warn that people might simply leave the movement out of frustration. ""Some people might feel dispirited and helpless. I hope they can see that other people haven't given up,"" Benny Tai told BBC News Chinese ahead of today's verdict. Seventy nine days of sit-in protests have already changed Hong Kong a lot. But today's verdict might serve more as a reminder that this city remains divided. At the trial Judge Johnny Chan rejected the idea that this would have a substantial impact on society. ""It cannot be reasonably argued that a charge of conspiracy to cause public nuisance would generate a chilling effect in society,"" he wrote in his ruling. But rights groups criticised the ruling, with Humans Rights Watch saying the court was ""sending a terrible message"". ""[This] will likely embolden the government to prosecute more peaceful activists, further chilling free expression in Hong Kong,"" said researcher Maya Wang in a statement to the BBC. One pro-democracy supporter outside the court held up a sign saying ""People's Hero"" Lord Chris Patten, the last British governor of Hong Kong, released a statement saying that it was ""appallingly divisive to use anachronistic common law charges in a vengeful pursuit of political events which took place in 2014"". This verdict comes after a string of frustrations for pro-democracy activists. In the last few years the courts have removed six lawmakers for changing their swearing in oaths to include protest phrases. Others have also been disqualified from running for office. The protests started in reaction to a decision made by China that it would allow direct elections in 2017, but only from a list of candidates pre-approved by Beijing. Beijing is highly sensitive about Hong Kong's status and any calls for more autonomy from China. The former British colony was handed back in 1997 on condition it would retain ""a high degree of autonomy, except in foreign and defence affairs"" for 50 years. Many people in Hong Kong believe they should have the right to elect their own leader. Young and unhappy in Hong Kong Beijing's struggle to win Hong Kong's young hearts In 2014, the three activists' calls for non-violent civil disobedience joined with student-led protests and snowballed into the massive demonstrations. Tens of thousands of people camped in the streets and demanded the right to fully free leadership elections. The pro-democracy protests bought an area of central Hong Kong to a standstill for weeks in 2014 The protests became known as the ""Umbrella Movement"" after people used umbrellas to shield themselves from pepper spray fired by police to disperse the crowd. Protesters accused the Chinese government of breaking its promise to allow full democracy in Hong Kong, and of encroaching more and more on the region. But the number of protesters dwindled to just a few hundred as the weeks dragged on and they ultimately failed to achieve their goal.

"This video can not be played What to expect from new BBC thriller The Victim The stars of new BBC One legal thriller The Victim believe viewers will be hooked from the start. The drama focuses on how the law is dealing with social media being used to ""out"" suspected criminals. Kelly Macdonald stars as the mother of a murdered child who is accused of illegally identifying a suspected killer online. The Trainspotting and Boardwalk Empire star is joined in the line-up by former Rebus actor John Hannah. The four-part show airs on consecutive nights from Monday to Thursday and the stars hope it will spark a debate about how people get their news. John Hannah toldBBC Scotland's The Nineprogramme: ""I think people will get hooked on the show right from the get-go, and they will find themselves instinctively making choices about the characters. Who's right, who's wrong - and then switching."" Kelly Macdonald plays the mother of a murdered child Kelly Macdonald plays Anna Dean, whose nine-year old son was murdered 15 years ago. She is accused of revealing her son's killer's new identity online and conspiring to have him murdered. She said: ""Anna is a mother, a family woman, who has had a very tragic thing happen to her years before. She may or may not be guilty of a crime."" Mother-of-two Kelly said making the show was an emotional challenge - but filming in her native Glasgow helped. She said: ""It was brilliant. I got to sleep in my own bed every night."" In the show, hard-working family man Craig Myers, played by James Harkness, is the victim of a vicious attack after he is accused of being the boy's killer. John Hannah plays DI Grover, an experienced detective investigating the attack on Myers and trying to discover who made the online accusation against him. Monday night's first episode was set on day one of a criminal trial at the High Court in Edinburgh. John Hannah's character tries to get to the bottom of who the real victim is The Victim follows the legal proceedings, while also covering the events leading up to the trial. John Hannah said: ""It starts in court and you see what's happening pretty much right away. And then there's the parallel story of the past and how things have unfolded to get to where they are. ""Everyone will have a very emotional connection to the show as they watch it. ""People will make decisions and then over the four episodes they'll question how they have done that. ""If that sort of thing happens in a broader sense with the news and the media, then that's good."" James Harkness plays Craig Myers who may or may not have a sinister past The show's creator Rob Williams says Craig and Anna are pitted against each other, but viewers' sympathies will be divided. New potential suspects will be revealed and long-buried secrets are unearthed as the story builds to find out who really is The Victim. Writer Williams says The Victim is not based on a true story, and is not inspired by any one case in particular. Asked about ""parallels"" with the 1993 murder of two-year-old James Bulger and subsequent attempts to expose the new identities of his 10-year-old killers Robert Thompson and Jon Venables, Williams said: ""Well it's not based on any one case, on any existing case. ""It explores a territory that, sadly, there are many cases in which juveniles have committed horrific offences, and not been named for legal reasons. Some of whom have been given new identities. ""So it's a territory we explore - it's not about any single case. It's hopefully a very even-handed treatment of a very emotive issue, and it is entirely fictional."" The Victim is on BBC One at 21:00 from Monday to Thursday this week.

"The US is considering imposing tariffs on about $11bn (Â£8.4bn) worth of goods from the European Union in response to subsidies that support Airbus. The World Trade Organization (WTO) has found that the subsidies have an adverse impact on the US. Aircraft and cheese are among the products that could be hit by tariffs, the US Trade Representative (USTR) said. The EU said the figure of $11bn was ""greatly exaggerated"". The move would mark an escalation in trade tensions between the US and the EU. TheUSTR said the value of goods that would be targeted with tariffs,externalwas subject to arbitration at the WTO, the result of which is expected in a few months. US-China trade row: What has happened so far? US imposes metal tariffs on key allies Olives pitting US against EU in global trade fight ""This case has been in litigation for 14 years, and the time has come for action. The administration is preparing to respond immediately when the WTO issues its finding on the value of US countermeasures,"" said US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer. ""Our ultimate goal is to reach an agreement with the EU to end all WTO-inconsistent subsidies to large civil aircraft. When the EU ends these harmful subsidies, the additional US duties imposed in response can be lifted."" A preliminary list of goods, covering a wide range of items, has been issued for public consultation. For example, the following are being considered for additional tariffs if they come from any of the 28 EU states. Salmon fillets, fresh or chilled Cheese, including Cheddar, Roquefort, Stilton, Gruyere and Pecorino Lemons fresh or dried Virgin olive oil Marsala wine Cashmere sweaters, pullovers and similar Ceramic household steins with pewter lids Motorcycles with an engine size of between 500cc and 700cc Wall clocks, not electrically operated, designed to operate over 47 hours without rewinding In addition, additional import duties are being considered on some goods if they are produced in France, Germany, Spain or the UK. They include: Helicopters Undercarriages for use in new civil aircraft Fuselages for use in new civil airplanes The proposed US tariffs would be imposed in addition to existing levies on European products. Last year, the USstarted charging levieson the imports of steel and aluminium from key allies including the EU. The EUimposed retaliatory tariffs on â¬2.8bn (Â£2.4bn) worth of US goodsin June on products such as bourbon whiskey, motorcycles and orange juice. Last month, US President Donald Trump threatened to impose tariffs on cars imported from the EU, if both sides cannot reach a trade deal. The Trump administration has been fighting trade battles on many fronts. The US is currently negotiating a trade deal with China, but tit-for-tat tariffs imposed by the two countries have already weighed on the global economy this year. The WTO has ruled that Airbus' A380 was unfairly subsidised By Andrew Walker, Economics correspondent US trade policy under President Trump has been criticised for what some see as a lack of respect for the rules and procedures of the World Trade Organization (WTO). The tariffs on steel and aluminium and on a range of Chinese goods were seen in that light by the Trump administration's international critics. Whatever the merits of those arguments, this move on civil aircraft is not a case of that. The WTO has ruled that the EU and the four governments involved in Airbus have failed to comply with an earlier ruling that they should withdraw contested subsidies and the US has asked for authorisation to retaliate to the tune of $11bn. The US wants to act quickly when the WTO arbitrator makes a ruling. So far this action seems to be following the WTO rule book. The EU said proposing to place tariffs on $11bn worth of goods was over the top. The figure was based on US internal estimates, and had not been set by the WTO, a Commission source said. ""The EU is confident that the level of countermeasures on which the notice is based is greatly exaggerated,"" the source added. ""The amount of WTO authorised retaliation can only be determined by the WTO-appointed arbitrator."" The EU is also locked in a row with the US over the EU's claims that Airbus-rival Boeing received illegal subsidies from the US government. As a result of this dispute, the EU is poised to propose a list US imports on which it will impose tariffs. ""In the parallel Boeing dispute, the determination of EU retaliation rights is also coming closer and the EU will request the WTO-appointed arbitrator to determine the EU's retaliation rights,"" the source said. ""The EU remains open for discussions with the US, provided these are without preconditions and aim at a fair outcome."" Airbus said the US tariff proposals were ""totally unjustified"". In a statement, the company added: ""The adoption expected this week of the WTO report will allow the EU to start sanctions proceeding with far larger countermeasures against the US. ""This would lead to unnecessary trade tensions and that shows the only reasonable solution is a negotiated settlement.""

"Danny Drinkwater will appear before magistrates charged with drink driving next month Chelsea and England footballer Danny Drinkwater has been charged with drink-driving after a car crash. The midfielder was arrested after a Range Rover crashed in Mere, Cheshire, in the early hours of Monday. Two women and a man were treated at the scene for minor injuries, Cheshire Police said. Mr Drinkwater, 29, of Nether Alderley in Cheshire, was released on unconditional bail to appear at Stockport Magistrates' Court on 13 May. Police were called to reports of a crash on Ashley Road, Mere, at 00:30 BST on Monday Police were called to reports of a one-vehicle crash on Ashley Road in Mere at 00:30 BST and arrested the footballer.

Danny Drinkwater played 35 times as Leicester won the Premier League in 2015-16 Danny Drinkwater was a product of the Manchester United youth academy but did not make a senior appearance for the club, spending loan spells at Huddersfield, Cardiff, Watford and Barnsley before joining Leicester in 2012. The midfielder was named in the Championship Team of the Year as the Foxes won promotion to the Premier League in the 2013-14 season. He remained a key part of the Leicester side as they overcame odds of 5,000-1 to win the Premier League under Claudio Ranieri in 2015-16. His performances during the Foxes' remarkable title-winning campaign earned him a first England call-up, making his debut against the Netherlands at Wembley in March 2016 and going on to win three caps to date. However, having asked to leave the club, he joined Chelsea in a Â£35m deal in September 2017, following former team-mate N'Golo Kante to Stamford Bridge after the midfielder's move the previous summer.

"Theresa May is holding last-minute Brexit talks with the French President Emmanuel Macron, with the UK due to leave the EU in three days' time. The UK PM will urge Mr Macron to back her request to delay Brexit again until 30 June, having earlier met German Chancellor Angela Merkel in Berlin. After the talks, Ms Merkel said a delay that runs to the end of the year or the start of 2020 was a possibility. There is a summit on Wednesday when all EU states will vote on an extension. Cross-party talks in Westminster aimed at breaking the impasse in Parliament finished, with both sides expressing hope there would be progress. A draft EU document circulated to diplomats ahead of the emergency meeting of EU leaders proposes an extension but leaves the date blank. The BBC's Brussels correspondent Adam Fleming said the document refers to an extension lasting ""only as long as is necessary and, in any event, no longer than XX.XX.XXXX and ending earlier if the Withdrawal Agreement is ratified"". European Council president Donald Tusk said there was ""little reason to believe"" that the ratification process of the withdrawal agreement could be completed by the end of June. In a letter to EU leaders, he said at Wednesday's summit members should discuss ""an alternative, longer extension"" that will be flexible and ""would last only as long as necessary and no longer than one year"". Live updates: MPs debate EU sanctions after Brexit Kuenssberg: Significant hurdles for cross-party talks Adler: EU keen to quiz May ahead of Brexit summit The UK is currently due to leave the EU at 23:00 BST on Friday. Downing Street said Mrs May and Ms Merkel discussed the UK's request for an extension of Article 50 - the process by which the UK leaves the EU - to 30 June, with the option to bring this forward if a deal is ratified earlier. The prime minister and Chancellor Merkel agreed ""on the importance of ensuring Britain's orderly withdrawal"", a statement said. This video can not be played There was no-one to greet the PM as she arrived to meet the German chancellor for Brexit talks in Berlin Ms Merkel said EU leaders would discuss a ""flextension"" - a one-year flexible extension - at Wednesday's summit. Following a meeting of the EU's General Affairs Council in Luxembourg, diplomats said ""slightly more than a handful"" of member states spoke in favour of a delay to 30 June and a majority were in favour of a longer extension. Adam Fleming said no maximum end extension date was agreed, although December 2019 and March 2020 were mentioned. Conditions of a delay were discussed including UK participation in May's European Parliament elections, no re-opening of the withdrawal agreement and how to guarantee the UK's pledge of ""sincere co-operation"" in ongoing EU business. So far, MPs have rejected the withdrawal agreement Mrs May reached with other European leaders last year. One of most contentious parts of the plan is the Irish backstop - an insurance policy that aims to prevent a hard border returning to the island of Ireland.

Brexit explained in flowcharts A really simple guide to Brexit Brexit Basics: The customs union On Tuesday afternoon, MPs approved a government motion asking MPs to approve the PM's request to the EU to delay Brexit, required aftera bill from Labour's Yvette Cooper became law. Please upgrade your browser to view this interactive Enter a postcode, or the name or constituency of your MP  The final decision on an extension lies with the EU - and the leaders of all the 27 other EU countries have to decide whether to grant or reject an extension. If the UK is still a member of the EU on 23 May, it will have to take part in European Parliamentary elections. Luxembourg's Foreign Minister Jean Asselborn said the UK would ""certainly not"" leave without a deal on Friday. But Ireland's Deputy Prime Minister Simon Coveney said a no-deal Brexit was still possible - even though it would represent ""an extraordinary failure of politics"". EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier said the EU has ""hope and expectation"" from the cross-party talks happening in Westminster and he would be willing to ""improve"" the political declaration ""within hours"". EU leaders are curious to hear the prime minister's Plan B. They hope there is one, although they're not convinced. They want to know, if they say yes to another Brexit extension, what it will be used for. And they suspect Theresa May wants them to do her dirty work for her. EU diplomatic sources I have spoken to suggest the prime minister may have officially asked the EU for a short new extension (until 30 June) as that was politically easier for her back home, whereas she believed and hoped (the theory goes) that EU leaders will insist instead on a flexible long extension that she actually needs. The bottom line is: EU leaders are extremely unlikely to refuse to further extend the Brexit process.

"This video can not be played Israel election: Will voters shift to the right? Israel is holding its most closely-fought general election in years. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, leader of the right-wing Likud Party, is seeking a fifth term in office. But he is facing corruption allegations and a strong challenge from former military chief Benny Gantz, head of the centrist Blue and White alliance. Pre-election polls suggested the two main contenders were neck-and-neck and that they would need to rely on smaller parties to form a governing coalition. Negotiations are expected to start soon after polls close at 22:00 local time (19:00 GMT). No party has ever won a majority in Israel's 120-seat parliament, the Knesset, and the country has always had coalition governments. More than 40 parties are contesting Tuesday's election, but only about a dozen are expected to overcome a 3.25% threshold, allowing them to enter parliament with four seats or more. Israel's election: Five things to know Israel election: Who are the key candidates? Israel's Benjamin Netanyahu: Commando turned PM The ex-military chief trying to unseat Netanyahu Final polls suggested Likud and Blue and White would both win about 30 seats. The left-wing Labour party was predicted to come third with about 10 seats, followed by the Arab alliance Hadash-Taal and United Torah Judaism, which represents ultra-Orthodox Jews. In Israel's fragmented party system the advantage remains with Mr Netanyahu, who still looks most likely to be able to form a new coalition government, says the BBC's Tom Bateman in Jerusalem. In a widely criticised move to lock down extra right-wing seats, Mr Netanyahu brokered a deal in February making it easier for candidates from an extreme-right wing party that many view as racist to enter parliament.  6.3mregistered voters 3months of campaigning 47parties taking part 120seats in parliament up for grabs On Tuesday, Israeli Arab politicians condemned Likud for sending 1,200 observers equipped with hidden body cameras to polling stations in Arab communities. Hadash-Taal said it was an ""illegal"" action by the ""extremist right"" that sought to intimidate Arabs and reduce turnout, but Likud said it wanted to ensure only ""valid votes"" were cast. A leading pollster said on Tuesday afternoon that he had never seen such a low turnout among Israeli Arabs, who make up almost a fifth of the population. The 69-year-old, who could overtake David Ben-Gurion as Israel's longest-serving prime minister if he is re-elected, called voting a ""sacred act"" when he cast his ballot in Jerusalem on Tuesday. ""You need to choose well, but I can't tell you for whom,"" he said. ""Or I can, but I'm not going to. God willing, Israel will win."" At a rally in Jerusalem on Monday, Mr Netanyahu told Likud supporters not to be ""complacent"" and urged them to turn out at polling stations. He warned that his ""leftist"" rivals could still win. Benjamin Netanyahu will become Israel's longest-serving prime minister if he is re-elected Our correspondent says Mr Netanyahu has appealed to Israel's increasingly right-wing voter base with tough messages on security and a significant announcement in the final days suggesting a new government would annex Jewish settlements in the occupied West Bank. The settlements are considered illegal under international law, although Israel disputes this. Our correspondent says Mr Netanyahu has faced an uncomfortable election race, dogged by looming corruption charges, and a flare-up in the conflict with Palestinian militants in the Gaza Strip. The prime minister denies the corruption allegations, and says he is a victim of a political ""witch hunt"" aimed at influencing the election. The 59-year-old retired lieutenant-general is a newcomer to politics who formed the Blue and White in February, promising to unite a country that had ""lost its way"". Casting his vote in the town of Rosh Haayin, near Tel Aviv, he called on Israelis to respect democracy and ""take responsibility"". Benny Gantz has vowed to form a government that would ""act responsibly, firmly and decisively"" ""Go to vote. Choose whoever you believe in. Respect each other and let us all wake up for a new dawn, a new history that we need to begin,"" he said. The former chief of staff of the Israeli military can rival Mr Netanyahu on security - one of the election's key issues - and is promising cleaner politics. He told Blue and White supporters in Tel Aviv on Monday that the prime minister wanted to ""create a legal fortress to guarantee his legal immunity in front of the serious charges he is facing"". Mr Gantz's campaign platform refers to ""separation"" from the Palestinians but does not specifically mention them having an independent state. It also calls for continued control over the Jordan Valley and retaining West Bank settlement blocs. Asked about the Israeli election on Tuesday, Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas told reporters in the West Bank: ""We hope they choose the just path, in the right direction, to reach out for peace.""

"This video can not be played What to expect from new BBC thriller The Victim The stars of new BBC One legal thriller The Victim believe viewers will be hooked from the start. The drama focuses on how the law is dealing with social media being used to ""out"" suspected criminals. Kelly Macdonald stars as the mother of a murdered child who is accused of illegally identifying a suspected killer online. The Trainspotting and Boardwalk Empire star is joined in the line-up by former Rebus actor John Hannah. The four-part show airs on consecutive nights from Monday to Thursday and the stars hope it will spark a debate about how people get their news. John Hannah toldBBC Scotland's The Nineprogramme: ""I think people will get hooked on the show right from the get-go, and they will find themselves instinctively making choices about the characters. Who's right, who's wrong - and then switching."" Kelly Macdonald plays the mother of a murdered child Kelly Macdonald plays Anna Dean, whose nine-year old son was murdered 15 years ago. She is accused of revealing her son's killer's new identity online and conspiring to have him murdered. She said: ""Anna is a mother, a family woman, who has had a very tragic thing happen to her years before. She may or may not be guilty of a crime."" Mother-of-two Kelly said making the show was an emotional challenge - but filming in her native Glasgow helped. She said: ""It was brilliant. I got to sleep in my own bed every night."" In the show, hard-working family man Craig Myers, played by James Harkness, is the victim of a vicious attack after he is accused of being the boy's killer. John Hannah plays DI Grover, an experienced detective investigating the attack on Myers and trying to discover who made the online accusation against him. Monday night's first episode was set on day one of a criminal trial at the High Court in Edinburgh. John Hannah's character tries to get to the bottom of who the real victim is The Victim follows the legal proceedings, while also covering the events leading up to the trial. John Hannah said: ""It starts in court and you see what's happening pretty much right away. And then there's the parallel story of the past and how things have unfolded to get to where they are. ""Everyone will have a very emotional connection to the show as they watch it. ""People will make decisions and then over the four episodes they'll question how they have done that. ""If that sort of thing happens in a broader sense with the news and the media, then that's good."" James Harkness plays Craig Myers who may or may not have a sinister past The show's creator Rob Williams says Craig and Anna are pitted against each other, but viewers' sympathies will be divided. New potential suspects will be revealed and long-buried secrets are unearthed as the story builds to find out who really is The Victim. Writer Williams says The Victim is not based on a true story, and is not inspired by any one case in particular. Asked about ""parallels"" with the 1993 murder of two-year-old James Bulger and subsequent attempts to expose the new identities of his 10-year-old killers Robert Thompson and Jon Venables, Williams said: ""Well it's not based on any one case, on any existing case. ""It explores a territory that, sadly, there are many cases in which juveniles have committed horrific offences, and not been named for legal reasons. Some of whom have been given new identities. ""So it's a territory we explore - it's not about any single case. It's hopefully a very even-handed treatment of a very emotive issue, and it is entirely fictional."" The Victim is on BBC One at 21:00 from Monday to Thursday this week.

"This video can not be played Cancer-preventing vaccine extended to boys Two new health initiatives are set to be rolled out in the fight against cancer. Boys aged 12-13 in Northern Ireland are to be offered a vaccine to protect them against Human Papilloma Virus (HPV)-related cancers. A better bowel cancer detection test is also being introduced. They are significant announcements for public health asthey bring Northern Ireland into linewith the rest of the UK. From September the HPV vaccine will be offered to all boys in year nine at school. It is hoped the immunisation programme will help reduce diagnoses of HPV-related cancers and save lives. It has also been decided that the Faecal Immunochemical Test (FIT) will replace the Faecal Occult Blood (FOB) test as the primary screening test for bowel cancer in the Bowel Cancer Screening Programme (BCSP) in Northern Ireland. Having HPV 'isn't rude or shameful' HPV vaccine linked to 'dramatic' drop in cervical disease Would you know if you had HPV? This however will not begin until early 2020. Department of Health permanent secretary Richard Pengelly said health protection clearly benefits the public. ""Both decisions have been under active consideration for some time and can now be made, following confirmation of the department's budget allocation for this year,"" he said. A very high proportion of all women under 25 have already taken up the opportunity to be vaccinated against the HPV virus since the programme was first introduced in 2008 and the intention is to protect boys through similar uptake rates. HPV is the name given to a common group of viruses; there are more than 100 types of HPV Many women will be with infected with HPV over the course of their lifetime without any ill-effect In the vast majority of cases, there will be no symptoms and the infection will clear on its own, but in some cases persistent infection can lead to cervical disease Some types of HPV are high risk because they are linked to the development of some cancers Nearly all cervical cancers (99.7%) are caused by infection from a high risk HPV Many types of HPV affect the mouth, throat or genital area. They're easy to catch - you can get HPV from sexual contact. Source:NHS Choices,external This extended programme offers the opportunity to make some HPV-related diseases and cancers a thing of the past building on the success of the programme in girls. The prevalence of the main HPV cancer-causing types 16 and 18 has already been reduced by more than 80%. Chief Medical Officer, Dr Michael McBride, said: ""We can now look forward to a future where we can be even more confident that we will reduce cervical cancer and other HPV related cancers that affect both men and women. ""This is an effective vaccine against a particularly harmful virus. I would encourage all parents to take up this offer and ensure their boys and girls are vaccinated."" The new FIT bowel screening test will be introduced from early 2020. While cancer charities welcome the move it had been hoped that it could have been introduced sooner. Self-testing kit 'saved my life' Jeremy Bowen diagnosed with bowel cancer Evidence has shown there is increased patient acceptability of the FIT screening test and increased uptake of screening will mean even more lives can be saved. Every year in Northern Ireland there are about 1,100 new cases of bowel cancer, with more than 400 deaths. The BCSP aims to pick up bowel cancer at an early stage, when treatment can be 90% successful. bleeding from your bottom and/or blood in your poo a persistent and unexplained change in bowel habit unexplained weight loss extreme tiredness for no obvious reason a pain or lump in your tummy ""The existing test for bowel cancer has proved hugely valuable in detecting cancer early and it is therefore essential that people invited to participate in the Northern Ireland Bowel Screening programme from 60-74 continue to complete it,"" Dr McBride said. Extending the HPV vaccination programme to include adolescent boys is based on advice from the Joint Committee of Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI), an independent panel of experts that provides advice to the four UK Health Departments. In January 2016, the UK National Screening Committee recommended that quantitative Faecal Immunochemical Test (FIT) should be adopted by the Bowel Cancer Screening Programme (BCSP) as the primary screening test for bowel cancer.

"Debenhams is on the brink of administration after it rejected a new offer from Sports Direct, made in the early hours of Tuesday, to pump Â£200m into the department store. Its shares were then suspended before Tuesday's trading, at its own request. Debenhams is likely to go into pre-pack administration, under which shops would continue trading but the business would come under the control of its lenders. On Monday, it rejected a Â£150m offer from Mike Ashley's company. The overnight offer was turned down because Mr Ashley wanted to be chief executive. It would have seen Sports Direct underwrite the raising of Â£200m by issuing new shares, higher than its previous proposal. Debenhams rejects Mike Ashley's last-ditch rescue plan Debenhams secures Â£200m lifeline with lenders A pre-pack administration lets a company sell itself, or its assets, as a going concern, without affecting the operation of the business. Administrators take over the running of the business to protect creditors and shareholders lose their investments. If Debenhams does use a pre-pack administration, Mr Ashley's near 30% stake in the company, which cost about Â£150m to build up, would be wiped out. While the shops would continue trading for now, Debenhams has proposed closing around 50 branches from next year and renegotiating rents with landlords to tackle its funding problems. Debenhams has been struggling for a while and issued three profit warnings last year. It also has a debt pile of Â£640m. Towards the end of 2018, the chain announced it was increasing its store closure plans from 10 to 50 over a three to five-year period. The company said it was not ready to release a list of which shops may be affected. In February, it was revealed that the shutting of 20 of those stores could be brought forward if the retailer took out a company voluntary arrangement (CVA), a form of insolvency that can enable firms to seek rent cuts and close unwanted stores. Debenhams has 165 stores and employs around 25,000 people. Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said that Tuesday was set to ""mark the endgame for control of the department store"" and that the rejection of Sports Direct's overnight bid ""suggests that Debenhams simply isn't interested in what Sports Direct has to offer"". He added: ""It looks like Mike Ashley has one final card to play, and that's making a firm takeover offer for Debenhams. Even that seems unlikely to shift the retailer from the course it's currently on, as it sounds like the department store is preparing to enter administration imminently.""

"The US is considering imposing tariffs on about $11bn (Â£8.4bn) worth of goods from the European Union in response to subsidies that support Airbus. The World Trade Organization (WTO) has found that the subsidies have an adverse impact on the US. Aircraft and cheese are among the products that could be hit by tariffs, the US Trade Representative (USTR) said. The EU said the figure of $11bn was ""greatly exaggerated"". The move would mark an escalation in trade tensions between the US and the EU. TheUSTR said the value of goods that would be targeted with tariffs,externalwas subject to arbitration at the WTO, the result of which is expected in a few months. US-China trade row: What has happened so far? US imposes metal tariffs on key allies Olives pitting US against EU in global trade fight ""This case has been in litigation for 14 years, and the time has come for action. The administration is preparing to respond immediately when the WTO issues its finding on the value of US countermeasures,"" said US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer. ""Our ultimate goal is to reach an agreement with the EU to end all WTO-inconsistent subsidies to large civil aircraft. When the EU ends these harmful subsidies, the additional US duties imposed in response can be lifted."" A preliminary list of goods, covering a wide range of items, has been issued for public consultation. For example, the following are being considered for additional tariffs if they come from any of the 28 EU states. Salmon fillets, fresh or chilled Cheese, including Cheddar, Roquefort, Stilton, Gruyere and Pecorino Lemons fresh or dried Virgin olive oil Marsala wine Cashmere sweaters, pullovers and similar Ceramic household steins with pewter lids Motorcycles with an engine size of between 500cc and 700cc Wall clocks, not electrically operated, designed to operate over 47 hours without rewinding In addition, additional import duties are being considered on some goods if they are produced in France, Germany, Spain or the UK. They include: Helicopters Undercarriages for use in new civil aircraft Fuselages for use in new civil airplanes The proposed US tariffs would be imposed in addition to existing levies on European products. Last year, the USstarted charging levieson the imports of steel and aluminium from key allies including the EU. The EUimposed retaliatory tariffs on â¬2.8bn (Â£2.4bn) worth of US goodsin June on products such as bourbon whiskey, motorcycles and orange juice. Last month, US President Donald Trump threatened to impose tariffs on cars imported from the EU, if both sides cannot reach a trade deal. The Trump administration has been fighting trade battles on many fronts. The US is currently negotiating a trade deal with China, but tit-for-tat tariffs imposed by the two countries have already weighed on the global economy this year. The WTO has ruled that Airbus' A380 was unfairly subsidised By Andrew Walker, Economics correspondent US trade policy under President Trump has been criticised for what some see as a lack of respect for the rules and procedures of the World Trade Organization (WTO). The tariffs on steel and aluminium and on a range of Chinese goods were seen in that light by the Trump administration's international critics. Whatever the merits of those arguments, this move on civil aircraft is not a case of that. The WTO has ruled that the EU and the four governments involved in Airbus have failed to comply with an earlier ruling that they should withdraw contested subsidies and the US has asked for authorisation to retaliate to the tune of $11bn. The US wants to act quickly when the WTO arbitrator makes a ruling. So far this action seems to be following the WTO rule book. The EU said proposing to place tariffs on $11bn worth of goods was over the top. The figure was based on US internal estimates, and had not been set by the WTO, a Commission source said. ""The EU is confident that the level of countermeasures on which the notice is based is greatly exaggerated,"" the source added. ""The amount of WTO authorised retaliation can only be determined by the WTO-appointed arbitrator."" The EU is also locked in a row with the US over the EU's claims that Airbus-rival Boeing received illegal subsidies from the US government. As a result of this dispute, the EU is poised to propose a list US imports on which it will impose tariffs. ""In the parallel Boeing dispute, the determination of EU retaliation rights is also coming closer and the EU will request the WTO-appointed arbitrator to determine the EU's retaliation rights,"" the source said. ""The EU remains open for discussions with the US, provided these are without preconditions and aim at a fair outcome."" Airbus said the US tariff proposals were ""totally unjustified"". In a statement, the company added: ""The adoption expected this week of the WTO report will allow the EU to start sanctions proceeding with far larger countermeasures against the US. ""This would lead to unnecessary trade tensions and that shows the only reasonable solution is a negotiated settlement.""

"About 20 staff were attacked at Feltham Young Offenders Institution Thirteen prison officers had to be taken to hospital after being assaulted by teenagers at a young offenders institution (YOI), it has emerged. The officers were among about 20 staff attacked during an outbreak of violence at the weekend at Feltham YOI in west London. One officer suffered a broken nose and another was concussed after being repeatedly punched. The Prison Service said the assaults were ""completely unacceptable"". Several members of staff were bitten during the disturbance in the section of the YOI known as Feltham A which accommodates 150 boys, most of whom are aged 16 and 17. The other part of the facility, Feltham B, holds young offenders aged 18 to 21. Violence took place in the section of the YOI known as Feltham A A prison minibus was used to drive injured officers to hospital - they were all later discharged. The prisoners involved will face adjudication hearings in the next 72 hours and could be referred to the police. A Prison Service spokesperson said: ""We will never tolerate violence against our staff and will push for the strongest possible punishment, which could lead to them spending more time behind bars."" It also offered its sympathies to the ""hard-working and committed"" staff who were caught up in the violence. Feltham A manages young people on remand and those who have been sentenced by the courts Mark Fairhurst, chairman of the Prison Officers' Association (POA), said violence had been escalating at Feltham for a number of weeks partly due to changes in the way it deals with inmates who misbehave. Until December last year, they could be locked in a cell in the segregation block, known as the Care, Separation and Reintegration Unit, which is located in Feltham B. But after the High Court ruled in 2017 that a 16-year-old had been held unlawfully in the block, and inspectors described the regime there as ""impoverished"" and ""punitive"", its use for younger boys was reduced and eventually stopped. Mr Fairhurst criticised the decision saying the lack of effective punishments for the most challenging prisoners was putting staff at risk. ""We shouldn't be afraid to use sanctions,"" he said. He tweeted that the POA would ""support staff and push for prosecutions"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

His members held meetings outside the jail on Monday to discuss their concerns and had talks with the Governor. As an alternative to segregation, a new section in Feltham A, known as the Falcon Unit, began operating in March to give the most challenging boys extra support. The Prison Service said it would contain ""calm down"" rooms by the end of the month. Last month, the Independent Monitoring Board, which carries out regular visits to Feltham, warned the government that it needed to take ""urgent measures"" to make Feltham safer after a rise in gang-related violence. In its annual report it said: ""It is clear from talking to prisoners and staff that many prisoner-on-prisoner assaults and multi-prisoner fights are 'organised' and happen as a result of gang activity on the outside.""

"For most workers, telling them they can't roll into the office stinking of alcohol or high on drugs is unnecessary - because it's taken as read. This week, though, the giant Lloyd's of London insurance market, in the City of London, is setting out a new code of conduct: it felt it needed to remind people. The 331-year-old institution, where brokers and insurers meet to do business, is regarded as the last bastion of the financial district's boozy culture. But after recent revelations of sexual harassment and general boorish behaviour, Lloyd's has decided to act. Two years ago the institution banned its staff from drinking between 9am and 5pm. But this only covered about 800 direct employees. Lloyd's is made up of thousands more people and independent operators. The organisation says there are about 40,000 pass holders who have access to the building. Now, anyone deemed under the influence of alcohol or drugs will be barred from the building. Security guards will have the right to confiscate passes of anyone breaching the new rule. The on-site bar will become a coffee shop. A hotline is being set up to expose bad behaviour. Anyone found responsible for sexual harassment risks being banned for life. But not everyone sees this as the answer. ""The problem has been exaggerated and the response is unnecessary,"" says a smoker loitering not too far from Lloyd's landmark building. Tom wouldn't give his surname, and wouldn't even confirm that he worked at Lloyd's. But he certainly knew about the recent reports of sexual misconduct and the new promise to act. ""You're telling people they can't have a couple of pints at lunchtime,"" he says. ""Lloyd's is a people business. We don't operate dangerous machinery."" And yet, that there was something rotten going on inside Lloyd's isn't in doubt. Last month,the Bloomberg news agency revealed a catalogue of sexual and verbal misconduct claims,external, with many fuelled by alcohol abuse. A picture was painted of an archaic institution whose culture was out-of-date, even by the standards of its neighbours in the financial district. Lloyd's boss John Neal, who took over six months ago, called the reports ""distressing"", adding: ""No one should be subjected to this sort of behaviour, and if it does happen, everyone has the right to be heard and for those responsible to be held to account."" The organisation knows that banning booze won't stop bad behaviour. It is, though, seen as an important signal in what Lloyd's says is a ""bigger action plan"" to improve the culture over time. Lloyd's vows action over sexual harassment Hurricanes behind insurer Lloyd's Â£1bn loss Lloyd's of London chief to step down Although some people might argue Lloyd's is over-reacting, in the City of London there are plenty of workers who agree that the organisation needs to modernise. In a square near the firm's headquarters, a group of young men are playing table tennis. Well-dressed, in regulation dark suits, they say they work in banking, not insurance. They point to their takeaway sandwiches as evidence. ""Lloyd's has a bit of a reputation for long lunches,"" says one. ""A lot of that disappeared years ago in other parts of the City."" Many objections seem to focus on a resentment at being told what to do. In a nearby pub, three men are drinking - one a large glass of wine and the other two have pints, but they're of orange juice and Coca-Cola. ""We're having a [computer] screen break - but we are discussing business. We're adults. If we drink responsibly, why should our employer lay down the law on what we do?"" There's a divide between generations too they point out: younger professionals avoid alcohol so they can go to the gym after work, or simply because they lead healthier lifestyles. At another local pub the assistant manager agrees habits have changed in the 15 years she's worked in the trade. ""I see far more men drinking soft drinks, not just at lunchtimes but after work,"" she says. There is still a hardcore, though, who drink. Her pub - she didn't want it identified - actually opens at 7am. ""There will be people - regulars - waiting outside at opening time to come in for a drink,"" she says. Having a drink after work, perhaps? No, she says. There's a man who has a couple of pints of lager, and a woman who downs a couple of vodkas (not so easy to smell on her breath, apparently) before work. ""It's more common than you might think."" These people may be functioning alcoholics, whose behaviour may not be affected by a booze ban at work. But it's not just drink, she says. ""I've seen more responsible drinking over the years, but a rise in drugs. If you don't take cocaine, people these days seem to think there's something wrong with you."" What does she think of the Lloyd's security guards who will be on the frontline of trying to impose a no drink or drugs policy? It could be a challenge. ""It's not always easy to spot, and it's not always easy to deal with when you do spot it.""

"Sports facilities have been built on part of the former steelworks A multi-million pound boost for plans to redevelop the former Ravenscraig steelworks site in North Lanarkshire has been agreed. Funding of Â£66m from the Glasgow Region City Deal will be used for a massive road development. Much of the site - which is bigger than Monaco - has already been developed, but a significant part is derelict. The site owners also want to create thousands of new homes and five primary schools. Part of the wider plans to improve the area's infrastructure will see new and upgraded roads from the M74 at Motherwell - through Ravenscraig, to the M8 at Eurocentral, and onward past Airdrie - on a new link road to the A73 south of Cumbernauld. The council has already agreed an extra Â£30m to be spent building new roads in the area and upgrading existing ones. The City Deal money will be used to finance the remainder of the plans. The eight regional council leaders who will benefit from the plans met on Tuesday to discuss moving the additional funds from existing North Lanarkshire projects into the Ravenscraig steelworks site project. Because the City Deal funding is for projects covering the wider Glasgow City region, other local councils had to back the move. Not all of the ambitious plans for the site have been realised Councillor Paul Kelly, deputy leader of North Lanarkshire Council, said the Ravencraig regeneration was of ""major strategic and economic importance"". He said a Lanarkshire roads project, which will cost more than Â£200m, would be ""the biggest single roads and infrastructure investment in North Lanarkshire's history"". He added that it would bring ""significant"" jobs and investment. He said it would bring 6,500 jobs and generate Â£360m for the local economy. He continued: ""It's vital that we focus on those projects that offer the best return on investment for our communities, our economy and for the future of North Lanarkshire."" Much of the Ravenscraig site has already been redeveloped - it includes a massive sports facility and a college. But a significant part is still derelict. Ravenscraig is one of Europe's largest brownfield regeneration sites and accounts for about an eighth of the Glasgow City Region's vacant and derelict land. Ravenscraig Ltd, who own the site, have a masterplan that will be considered by North Lanarkshire Council in the coming weeks. It includes plans for: 3,000 houses 19,000m2 of office space 63,000m2 of industrial space 30,000m2 of retail space Five primary schools and associated nursery provision Extension to the Ravenscraig Regional Sports Facility New 7 hectare town park The Â£1.13bn Glasgow City Region City Deal is an agreement between the UK government, Scottish government and eight local authorities across Glasgow and the Clyde Valley. The money is being used to fund major infrastructure projects and to boost employment. Other aims include improving public transport and connectivity and generating billions of pounds of private sector investment. The Scottish and UK governments, who have committed more than Â£500m each to the deal, welcomed the news. Scottish Secretary David Mundell said the UK government had ""an ambitious goal of creating jobs and opportunities and stimulating long-lasting growth for local communities"". He added: ""This project has the potential to transform Ravenscraig and will help to attract significant private sector investment to bring new homes and businesses to the site."" Michael Matheson, the Scottish government's infrastructure secretary, said: ""I am pleased to see North Lanarkshire Council and the wider Glasgow City Region continue to drive this deal forward and work together in the best interests of the regional economy.""

"This video can not be played Israel election: Will voters shift to the right? Israel is holding its most closely-fought general election in years. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, leader of the right-wing Likud Party, is seeking a fifth term in office. But he is facing corruption allegations and a strong challenge from former military chief Benny Gantz, head of the centrist Blue and White alliance. Pre-election polls suggested the two main contenders were neck-and-neck and that they would need to rely on smaller parties to form a governing coalition. Negotiations are expected to start soon after polls close at 22:00 local time (19:00 GMT). No party has ever won a majority in Israel's 120-seat parliament, the Knesset, and the country has always had coalition governments. More than 40 parties are contesting Tuesday's election, but only about a dozen are expected to overcome a 3.25% threshold, allowing them to enter parliament with four seats or more. Israel's election: Five things to know Israel election: Who are the key candidates? Israel's Benjamin Netanyahu: Commando turned PM The ex-military chief trying to unseat Netanyahu Final polls suggested Likud and Blue and White would both win about 30 seats. The left-wing Labour party was predicted to come third with about 10 seats, followed by the Arab alliance Hadash-Taal and United Torah Judaism, which represents ultra-Orthodox Jews. In Israel's fragmented party system the advantage remains with Mr Netanyahu, who still looks most likely to be able to form a new coalition government, says the BBC's Tom Bateman in Jerusalem. In a widely criticised move to lock down extra right-wing seats, Mr Netanyahu brokered a deal in February making it easier for candidates from an extreme-right wing party that many view as racist to enter parliament.  6.3mregistered voters 3months of campaigning 47parties taking part 120seats in parliament up for grabs On Tuesday, Israeli Arab politicians condemned Likud for sending 1,200 observers equipped with hidden body cameras to polling stations in Arab communities. Hadash-Taal said it was an ""illegal"" action by the ""extremist right"" that sought to intimidate Arabs and reduce turnout, but Likud said it wanted to ensure only ""valid votes"" were cast. A leading pollster said on Tuesday afternoon that he had never seen such a low turnout among Israeli Arabs, who make up almost a fifth of the population. The 69-year-old, who could overtake David Ben-Gurion as Israel's longest-serving prime minister if he is re-elected, called voting a ""sacred act"" when he cast his ballot in Jerusalem on Tuesday. ""You need to choose well, but I can't tell you for whom,"" he said. ""Or I can, but I'm not going to. God willing, Israel will win."" At a rally in Jerusalem on Monday, Mr Netanyahu told Likud supporters not to be ""complacent"" and urged them to turn out at polling stations. He warned that his ""leftist"" rivals could still win. Benjamin Netanyahu will become Israel's longest-serving prime minister if he is re-elected Our correspondent says Mr Netanyahu has appealed to Israel's increasingly right-wing voter base with tough messages on security and a significant announcement in the final days suggesting a new government would annex Jewish settlements in the occupied West Bank. The settlements are considered illegal under international law, although Israel disputes this. Our correspondent says Mr Netanyahu has faced an uncomfortable election race, dogged by looming corruption charges, and a flare-up in the conflict with Palestinian militants in the Gaza Strip. The prime minister denies the corruption allegations, and says he is a victim of a political ""witch hunt"" aimed at influencing the election. The 59-year-old retired lieutenant-general is a newcomer to politics who formed the Blue and White in February, promising to unite a country that had ""lost its way"". Casting his vote in the town of Rosh Haayin, near Tel Aviv, he called on Israelis to respect democracy and ""take responsibility"". Benny Gantz has vowed to form a government that would ""act responsibly, firmly and decisively"" ""Go to vote. Choose whoever you believe in. Respect each other and let us all wake up for a new dawn, a new history that we need to begin,"" he said. The former chief of staff of the Israeli military can rival Mr Netanyahu on security - one of the election's key issues - and is promising cleaner politics. He told Blue and White supporters in Tel Aviv on Monday that the prime minister wanted to ""create a legal fortress to guarantee his legal immunity in front of the serious charges he is facing"". Mr Gantz's campaign platform refers to ""separation"" from the Palestinians but does not specifically mention them having an independent state. It also calls for continued control over the Jordan Valley and retaining West Bank settlement blocs. Asked about the Israeli election on Tuesday, Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas told reporters in the West Bank: ""We hope they choose the just path, in the right direction, to reach out for peace.""

"This video can not be played The ""Umbrella Movement"" activists said they would continue to strive for democracy Nine pro-democracy activists in Hong Kong have been found guilty of public nuisance charges for their role in a civil disobedience movement that called for free elections in the city. Among them are three prominent activists, seen as figureheads of Hong Kong's pro-democracy movement. They could be jailed for up to seven years for their part in the ""Umbrella Movement"" protests of 2014. Thousands marched demanding the right for Hong Kong to choose its own leader. Those convicted include the so-called ""Occupy trio"" - sociology professor Chan Kin-man, 60, law professor Benny Tai, 54, and Baptist minister Chu Yiu-ming, 75. They are seen as the founders of the movement that galvanised protesters in their campaign of civil disobedience. ""No matter what happens today... we will persist on and do not give up,"" Mr Tai told reporters ahead of the verdict. Mr Tai, Mr Chan and five others were found guilty of two charges of public nuisance,external, and Mr Chu and one other of just one charge. A large crowd gathered outside the court on Thursday to support them. It is not yet clear when they will be sentenced. Chu Yiu-ming, Benny Tai and Chan Kin-man (left to right) were charged under colonial-era laws that carry possible jail terms of up to seven years By Martin Yip, BBC News Chinese, Hong Kong The nine defendants walked into the court building looking refreshed and in high spirits. All but one said a few words in what might have been their last hours of freedom before their predicted jail term. Delivering his verdict, Justice Johnny Chan said the defendants had caused a nuisance - by occupying major roads - leading to injuries among civilians. The nine looked calm and not particularly emotional. They were later released on bail. Benny Tai, Chan Kin-man and Chu Yiu-ming smiled as they passed me, as if it was just another day. They are yet to say if they will appeal. The court was adjourned for the day as the lawyers are yet to finish their mitigation submissions. The sentences have yet to be announced. The broader pro-democracy camp already has bad relations with Beijing. Activists and politicians did express their anger but political analysts also warn that people might simply leave the movement out of frustration. ""Some people might feel dispirited and helpless. I hope they can see that other people haven't given up,"" Benny Tai told BBC News Chinese ahead of today's verdict. Seventy nine days of sit-in protests have already changed Hong Kong a lot. But today's verdict might serve more as a reminder that this city remains divided. At the trial Judge Johnny Chan rejected the idea that this would have a substantial impact on society. ""It cannot be reasonably argued that a charge of conspiracy to cause public nuisance would generate a chilling effect in society,"" he wrote in his ruling. But rights groups criticised the ruling, with Humans Rights Watch saying the court was ""sending a terrible message"". ""[This] will likely embolden the government to prosecute more peaceful activists, further chilling free expression in Hong Kong,"" said researcher Maya Wang in a statement to the BBC. One pro-democracy supporter outside the court held up a sign saying ""People's Hero"" Lord Chris Patten, the last British governor of Hong Kong, released a statement saying that it was ""appallingly divisive to use anachronistic common law charges in a vengeful pursuit of political events which took place in 2014"". This verdict comes after a string of frustrations for pro-democracy activists. In the last few years the courts have removed six lawmakers for changing their swearing in oaths to include protest phrases. Others have also been disqualified from running for office. The protests started in reaction to a decision made by China that it would allow direct elections in 2017, but only from a list of candidates pre-approved by Beijing. Beijing is highly sensitive about Hong Kong's status and any calls for more autonomy from China. The former British colony was handed back in 1997 on condition it would retain ""a high degree of autonomy, except in foreign and defence affairs"" for 50 years. Many people in Hong Kong believe they should have the right to elect their own leader. Young and unhappy in Hong Kong Beijing's struggle to win Hong Kong's young hearts In 2014, the three activists' calls for non-violent civil disobedience joined with student-led protests and snowballed into the massive demonstrations. Tens of thousands of people camped in the streets and demanded the right to fully free leadership elections. The pro-democracy protests bought an area of central Hong Kong to a standstill for weeks in 2014 The protests became known as the ""Umbrella Movement"" after people used umbrellas to shield themselves from pepper spray fired by police to disperse the crowd. Protesters accused the Chinese government of breaking its promise to allow full democracy in Hong Kong, and of encroaching more and more on the region. But the number of protesters dwindled to just a few hundred as the weeks dragged on and they ultimately failed to achieve their goal.

"Ministers and their shadow counterparts will continue cross-party talks on Tuesday, Downing Street has said, as they try to break the Brexit deadlock. ""Technical"" discussions among officials took place on Monday evening. Sources indicated the PM had not accepted Labour's customs union demand, but there was a move towards changing the non-binding political declaration. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said there had been no change in the government's ""red lines"". A Downing Street spokesman said the government was ""committed to finding a way through"" which requires both sides ""to work at a pace"". The UK is currently due to leave the EU at 23:00 BST on Friday. So far, MPs have rejected the withdrawal agreement Theresa May reached with other European leaders last year. Kuenssberg: Significant hurdles for cross-party talks Brexit explained in flowcharts A really simple guide to Brexit Brexit Basics: The customs union She is due to attend an emergency summit in Brussels on Wednesday, where EU leaders will expect to hear fresh plans aimed at ending the impasse in Parliament. Ahead of this, Mrs May will hold talks with German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron in Berlin and Paris on Tuesday. On Monday evening, Parliament passed a bill brought by Labour MP Yvette Cooper, which aims to force the prime minister to request a Brexit extension rather than leave the EU without a deal. However, the final decision on an extension lies with the EU. The bill received Royal Assent from the Queen on Monday night and has become law. Commons Leader Andrea Leadsom told MPs that if this happens on Monday evening, there will be a government motion on Tuesday asking the House to approve the PM's request to the EU to delay Brexit until 30 June. Please upgrade your browser Use the list below or select a button During the cross-party Downing Street talks, the government reportedly suggested offering Labour a guarantee that any deal they reached could not be undone, creating a ""lock"". This would aim to ease Labour concerns that any promises could be unpicked by the next Conservative leader. But BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg said there was ""deep concern"" on the Labour side that any legal promise could be undone by further legislation. However, the prime minister was warned by members of the 1922 committee of Conservative backbenchers that agreeing a customs union with the EU in Brexit talks would be ""unacceptable"". The MPs met Mrs May in Downing Street and it is understood they were more open to the idea of a customs arrangement, which would allow the UK to do its own trade deals. Talks between Labour and the government began last week, with Mrs May saying only a cross-party pact would see MPs agree a deal in Parliament.

Mr Corbyn said: ""Talks have to mean a movement and so far there's been no change in those red lines."" The Labour leader said there were ""many concerns"" his party had over the political declaration - a plan for the future relationship with the EU - which it planned to put to the government in their discussions. Meanwhile, the government has taken steps to ensure the UK can take part in European Parliament elections on 23 May. A Day of Poll Order has been laid in Parliament, which is required by law for the vote to take place. The Cabinet Office said it was taking responsible steps, but the move did not make participation in the elections inevitable. On Monday, EU chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barniermet Irish Taoiseach Leo Varadkar in Dublinand told reporters he hoped the UK's cross-party talks would ""produce a positive outcome"". But he said that, if the UK left the EU without a deal, ""we will not discuss anything with the UK until there is an agreement for Ireland and Northern Ireland, as well as for citizens' rights and for the financial settlement"". The EU would ""stand fully behind Ireland"" regardless of what happens with Brexit, he added.

"Theresa May is holding last-minute Brexit talks with the French President Emmanuel Macron, with the UK due to leave the EU in three days' time. The UK PM will urge Mr Macron to back her request to delay Brexit again until 30 June, having earlier met German Chancellor Angela Merkel in Berlin. After the talks, Ms Merkel said a delay that runs to the end of the year or the start of 2020 was a possibility. There is a summit on Wednesday when all EU states will vote on an extension. Cross-party talks in Westminster aimed at breaking the impasse in Parliament finished, with both sides expressing hope there would be progress. A draft EU document circulated to diplomats ahead of the emergency meeting of EU leaders proposes an extension but leaves the date blank. The BBC's Brussels correspondent Adam Fleming said the document refers to an extension lasting ""only as long as is necessary and, in any event, no longer than XX.XX.XXXX and ending earlier if the Withdrawal Agreement is ratified"". European Council president Donald Tusk said there was ""little reason to believe"" that the ratification process of the withdrawal agreement could be completed by the end of June. In a letter to EU leaders, he said at Wednesday's summit members should discuss ""an alternative, longer extension"" that will be flexible and ""would last only as long as necessary and no longer than one year"". Live updates: MPs debate EU sanctions after Brexit Kuenssberg: Significant hurdles for cross-party talks Adler: EU keen to quiz May ahead of Brexit summit The UK is currently due to leave the EU at 23:00 BST on Friday. Downing Street said Mrs May and Ms Merkel discussed the UK's request for an extension of Article 50 - the process by which the UK leaves the EU - to 30 June, with the option to bring this forward if a deal is ratified earlier. The prime minister and Chancellor Merkel agreed ""on the importance of ensuring Britain's orderly withdrawal"", a statement said. This video can not be played There was no-one to greet the PM as she arrived to meet the German chancellor for Brexit talks in Berlin Ms Merkel said EU leaders would discuss a ""flextension"" - a one-year flexible extension - at Wednesday's summit. Following a meeting of the EU's General Affairs Council in Luxembourg, diplomats said ""slightly more than a handful"" of member states spoke in favour of a delay to 30 June and a majority were in favour of a longer extension. Adam Fleming said no maximum end extension date was agreed, although December 2019 and March 2020 were mentioned. Conditions of a delay were discussed including UK participation in May's European Parliament elections, no re-opening of the withdrawal agreement and how to guarantee the UK's pledge of ""sincere co-operation"" in ongoing EU business. So far, MPs have rejected the withdrawal agreement Mrs May reached with other European leaders last year. One of most contentious parts of the plan is the Irish backstop - an insurance policy that aims to prevent a hard border returning to the island of Ireland. This video can not be played Andrea Leadsom: Merkel should reopen withdrawal deal The EU has continually said it will not re-open the withdrawal agreement for negotiations, but Leader of the Commons Andrea Leadsom renewed her plea for them to look again.

Further talks are due to be held on Thursday.

Brexit explained in flowcharts A really simple guide to Brexit Brexit Basics: The customs union On Tuesday afternoon, MPs approved a government motion asking MPs to approve the PM's request to the EU to delay Brexit, required aftera bill from Labour's Yvette Cooper became law. Please upgrade your browser to view this interactive Enter a postcode, or the name or constituency of your MP  The final decision on an extension lies with the EU - and the leaders of all the 27 other EU countries have to decide whether to grant or reject an extension. If the UK is still a member of the EU on 23 May, it will have to take part in European Parliamentary elections. Luxembourg's Foreign Minister Jean Asselborn said the UK would ""certainly not"" leave without a deal on Friday. But Ireland's Deputy Prime Minister Simon Coveney said a no-deal Brexit was still possible - even though it would represent ""an extraordinary failure of politics"". EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier said the EU has ""hope and expectation"" from the cross-party talks happening in Westminster and he would be willing to ""improve"" the political declaration ""within hours"". EU leaders are curious to hear the prime minister's Plan B. They hope there is one, although they're not convinced. They want to know, if they say yes to another Brexit extension, what it will be used for. And they suspect Theresa May wants them to do her dirty work for her. EU diplomatic sources I have spoken to suggest the prime minister may have officially asked the EU for a short new extension (until 30 June) as that was politically easier for her back home, whereas she believed and hoped (the theory goes) that EU leaders will insist instead on a flexible long extension that she actually needs. The bottom line is: EU leaders are extremely unlikely to refuse to further extend the Brexit process.

"Judges and magistrates will have to ask themselves several questions when sentencing offenders with mental illnesses or disorders Judges handing sentences to criminals with mental illnesses or learning difficulties will have to follow specific guidelines for the first time. New draft sentencing guidelines are being issued in England and Wales to ensure that courts are fair when deciding how responsible mentally ill offenders are for their crimes. It could see some offenders with mental disorders receive lighter sentences. One charity called it a ""big step"" for the justice system. The draft new guidance from the Sentencing Council for England and Wales applies to offenders who are aged 18 and have conditions such as learning disabilities, schizophrenia, depression, post-traumatic stress, dementia and disorders resulting from drug or alcohol misuse. It means judges and magistrates would need to consider several questions when determining how much responsibility the mentally-ill offenders bear for their crimes, including: Did the individual's condition impair their ability to exercise appropriate judgment, make rational choices or think clearly? Did they seek help, and fail to receive appropriate treatment or care? Were there any elements of premeditation or pre-planning in the offence? If the offender exacerbated their condition by drinking or taking drugs, were they aware of the potential effects of doing so? The new guidance does not aim to change sentencing practice but instead provide judges and magistrates with a ""clear structure"" to follow. And just because an offender has such a condition or disorder does not necessarily mean that they will receive a different sentence, the draft guidance says. It explains: ""In some cases the condition may mean that culpability is significantly reduced, in others, the condition may have no relevance to culpability."" Judge Rosa Dean, a member of the Sentencing Council, said: ""The offender's mental health is just one element that the courts must consider, and the guideline strives to balance the rights and needs of offenders with protecting the public, the rights of victims and families, and their need to feel safe."" And Lucy Schonegevel, from the charity Rethink Mental Illness, said: ""This is a big step towards the justice system having a better understanding of mental illness, as it's the first time there will be specific sentencing guidelines in this area."" 'The day I went to prison, I got my life back' Impulsive crime 'should prompt ADHD test' The judges turning courts inside out Prison mental health team 'fire-fighting' The Sentencing Council said data suggests that people in the criminal justice system are more likely to suffer from mental health problems than the general population. According to a 2017 report, nearly one quarter (23%) of inmates arriving at prison had previously been in contact with mental health services. A Ministry of Justice spokesman said: ""It is vital the courts have clear and consistent guidance in these often complex cases, so that an offender's mental health is addressed and the public kept safe."" The draft guidance, which is subject to consultation, must be followed unless a judge or magistrate considers it is not in the interests of justice to do so. It will be used alongside current guidelines, which exist to ensure that sentences are consistent across different courts. TheSentencing Council has a range of guidelines,externalon different factors. Currently, pre-sentence reports are compiled for offenders, which can help the court decide which sentence to pass.Rethink Mental Illness charity says these can include information,externalabout mental health problems or drug and alcohol issues, for example.

"More than 250 record stores will be taking part in the event on 13 April The Mighty Boosh have been announced as the 2019 UK ambassadors for Record Store Day, which celebrates independent record shops around the country. Comedy duo Noel Fielding and Julian Barratt follow the likes of Elton John, Dave Grohl and St Vincent in the role. ""The bar's been set at a new height,"" Julian tells Radio 1 Newsbeat. ""I didn't want it to change me but I think it might have,"" Noel Fielding adds. ""It's definitely put a spring in my step."" The Mighty Boosh's left-field take on musical comedy first hit screens in 2004 after theatre shows and radio series This is the comedy duo's first official outing as The Boosh for more than five years. Since their BBC TV show came to an end in 2007 they've done a live theatre tour and made a handful of appearances at festivals around the world. Despite saying they'd ""love to put out"" live shows and an album of tracks they recorded in New York ""at some point"", the duo say their Record Store Day duties are, for now, a one-off appearance for The Mighty Boosh. It's fair to say they're taking their role seriously though. Noel and Julian say they're on a mission to get the nation to ""slow down and get physical"". Julian remembers his ""formative years"" discovering music at Jumbo Records in Leeds: ""It's about chatting to the people behind the desk, the people you bump into in the shop... it's a magical journey, a pilgrimage."" This video can not be played It's been a while since we've seen these two together He says that whereas now you ""turn on the digital tap and music just comes out"", it's not like that with physical records. ""You've got to get over this hump of effort with records - it make you choose differently. ""You're fighting for attention and that's why it's important places like this exist."" Noel says it's nice to go through somebody's record collection, too. ""If you were on a date or you'd just met someone, you could have a peek at their collection and think 'Oh, this isn't going to work'."" Noel has created original artwork for the Mighty Boosh's release To celebrate their role as UK ambassadors, it was previously announced that the duo's original radio series will be available on vinyl for the first time. The show made its debut in 2001 on BBC London Live, before eventually being aired on BBC Radio 4. ""It was on in the afternoon after a sports round-up... that presenter hated our show,"" Julian says. Noel adds: ""He'd be talking about how Spurs were playing then he'd go, 'Anyway, now we've got... I don't even know what this is'. ""Then our show would come on to a load of angry football fans."" As fans of The Mighty Boosh might expect, they've also got a more surreal ambassadorial offering. ""We can come to people's houses and provide a personal service,"" Noel offers. ""We'll push vinyl into people's faces and make them smell and feel records. ""We might also melt some vinyl down and make shoes out of it. There could be some hats and broaches? ""We're here for you, we're here for all of vinyl and record shops. Well... all the independent ones in the UK."" Record Store Day takes place on 13 April.

"Click or tap on an underlined word for a short definition or explanation Those eligible to vote in Indiaâs general election represent more than 10% of the worldâs population and they have been taking part in thelargest democratic exercisein history. India held its first elections in 1951-2 after the country gained independence from the UK in 1947. This year there are more than 900 million eligible voters â nearly four times as many as the United States â the next largest democracy. Over the past five weeks voters have been choosing representatives for the Indian parliament, and in turn deciding if Hindu nationalist Prime Minister Narendra Modi will run the country for another five years. Results are expected on 23 May. Whoever wins these elections and forms a government will control the destiny of the world's largest democracy. While they are in charge,Indiaâs economyis likely to overtake the UKâs and become the worldâs fifth-largest. Narendra Modi was swept to power in 2014 with bold economic promises, but his record in office has been mixed. Economic growth has hovered around 7% a year and some ambitious reforms â like a Goods and Services tax - have been praised. Others, like the sudden withdrawal of large-value banknotes in 2016, are seen as a failure. Its population meanwhile - at more than 1.34bn people - is predicted to soon surpass Chinaâs 1.39bn. Hundreds of millions of Indians have escapedpovertysince the turn of the millennium but huge challenges remain. The proportion of Indians that live below the international poverty line decreased from 21.6% in 2011 to an estimated 13.4% in 2015, according to the World Bank. Unemploymentis a major concern and is especially high among young people. Leaked government data in January revealed that unemployment â at 6.1% - is at the highest itâs been since 1972-73, with nearly one in five 15-29 year-olds unable to find a job. Millions offarmers are angryabout low crop prices. Indian agriculture has been blighted by falling crop prices, a depleting water table and drought in the last few years. Regular protests are held and suicides among farmers are common. How the nuclear-armed country engages with the outside world â and manages a trickyrelationship with its neighbour Pakistanâ is also of immense importance to international security. India and Pakistan have fought three wars since independence from Britain in 1947. They both have nuclear weapons. One of the main points of dispute is the Kashmir region, which both claim in full but control in part. Tensions there recently spilled over, with each side carrying out air strikes. Indians are voting for members of parliament and the job of prime minister tends to go to the leader of the party or coalition with most seats. The current PM isNarendra Modi. Indiaâs current prime minister has had an extraordinary political journey. Rising from a modest background, he went on to become the three-time chief minister of the western state of Gujarat. The 2014 election victory that propelled him to the national leadership was the most comprehensive since 1984. His main rival is opposition leaderRahul Gandhi. Mr Gandhi is heir to the famous Gandhi-Nehru political dynasty. He took over from his mother, Sonia Gandhi, as Congress Party president in December 2017. Mr Gandhi has long been seen as aloof and a poor campaigner, but that image has been changing in recent times. Parliament has two houses: the Lok Sabha and theRajya Sabha. Members of Indiaâs upper house are elected by state lawmakers. The president also nominates 12 members for their contribution to the arts, sport or business. The lower house âLok Sabhaâ is the one to watch. Lok Sabha is a Hindi term for âHouse of the peopleâ. Its members are directly elected by voters. It has 543 elected seats and any party or coalition needs a minimum of 272 MPs to form a government. At the last election in 2014, Mr ModiâsBJPwon 282 seats. The Bharatiya Janata Party is the largest party in the National Democratic Alliance, a centre-right to right-wing coalition of parties. Mr GandhiâsCongress Partyonly took 44 seats in 2014 â down from 206 in 2009. The Indian National Congress or Congress Party is Indiaâs oldest political party. It forms part of the United Progressive Alliance (UPA) - a coalition of centre-left parties. Because of the enormous number of election officials and security personnel involved, voting will take place in seven stages between 11 April and 19 May. Different states will vote at different times. Votes will be counted on 23 May and results are expected on the same day. This election is being seen as a referendum on Mr Modi, a polarising figure adored by many but also accused of stoking divisions betweenIndiaâs Hindu majorityand the countryâs 200 million Muslims. About 80% of Indians are Hindu. Muslims make up nearly 15% of the population. Other significant minorities include Christians, Sikhs, Buddhists and Jains. Until a few months ago, Mr Modi and his BJP party were seen as the overwhelming favourites. But theloss of key statesin Decemberâs regional elections injected a sense of serious competition into the national vote. The party lost control of the states of Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan. These are all part of Indiaâs Hindi-speaking heartland, which helped Mr Modi win in 2014. Analysts are divided on whether Mr Modi will be able to win a simple majority again. A recent escalation of tensions with Pakistan has given the BJP a new and popular issue to campaign on. It will be hoping that a focus on patriotism will help the party to get past the serious challenge mounted by powerful regional parties and Congress.

Leaked government data in January revealed that unemployment â at 6.1% - is at the highest itâs been since 1972-73, with nearly one in five 15-29 year-olds unable to find a job. Millions offarmers are angryabout low crop prices. Indian agriculture has been blighted by falling crop prices, a depleting water table and drought in the last few years. Regular protests are held and suicides among farmers are common. How the nuclear-armed country engages with the outside world â and manages a trickyrelationship with its neighbour Pakistanâ is also of immense importance to international security. India and Pakistan have fought three wars since independence from Britain in 1947. They both have nuclear weapons. One of the main points of dispute is the Kashmir region, which both claim in full but control in part. Tensions there recently spilled over, with each side carrying out air strikes. Indians are voting for members of parliament and the job of prime minister tends to go to the leader of the party or coalition with most seats. The current PM isNarendra Modi. Indiaâs current prime minister has had an extraordinary political journey. Rising from a modest background, he went on to become the three-time chief minister of the western state of Gujarat. The 2014 election victory that propelled him to the national leadership was the most comprehensive since 1984. His main rival is opposition leaderRahul Gandhi. Mr Gandhi is heir to the famous Gandhi-Nehru political dynasty. He took over from his mother, Sonia Gandhi, as Congress Party president in December 2017. Mr Gandhi has long been seen as aloof and a poor campaigner, but that image has been changing in recent times. Parliament has two houses: the Lok Sabha and theRajya Sabha. Members of Indiaâs upper house are elected by state lawmakers. The president also nominates 12 members for their contribution to the arts, sport or business. The lower house âLok Sabhaâ is the one to watch. Lok Sabha is a Hindi term for âHouse of the peopleâ. Its members are directly elected by voters. It has 543 elected seats and any party or coalition needs a minimum of 272 MPs to form a government. At the last election in 2014, Mr ModiâsBJPwon 282 seats. The Bharatiya Janata Party is the largest party in the National Democratic Alliance, a centre-right to right-wing coalition of parties. Mr GandhiâsCongress Partyonly took 44 seats in 2014 â down from 206 in 2009. The Indian National Congress or Congress Party is Indiaâs oldest political party. It forms part of the United Progressive Alliance (UPA) - a coalition of centre-left parties. Because of the enormous number of election officials and security personnel involved, voting will take place in seven stages between 11 April and 19 May. Different states will vote at different times. Votes will be counted on 23 May and results are expected on the same day. This election is being seen as a referendum on Mr Modi, a polarising figure adored by many but also accused of stoking divisions betweenIndiaâs Hindu majorityand the countryâs 200 million Muslims. About 80% of Indians are Hindu. Muslims make up nearly 15% of the population. Other significant minorities include Christians, Sikhs, Buddhists and Jains. Until a few months ago, Mr Modi and his BJP party were seen as the overwhelming favourites. But theloss of key statesin Decemberâs regional elections injected a sense of serious competition into the national vote. The party lost control of the states of Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan. These are all part of Indiaâs Hindi-speaking heartland, which helped Mr Modi win in 2014. Analysts are divided on whether Mr Modi will be able to win a simple majority again. A recent escalation of tensions with Pakistan has given the BJP a new and popular issue to campaign on. It will be hoping that a focus on patriotism will help the party to get past the serious challenge mounted by powerful regional parties and Congress.

"About 20 staff were attacked at Feltham Young Offenders Institution Thirteen prison officers had to be taken to hospital after being assaulted by teenagers at a young offenders institution (YOI), it has emerged. The officers were among about 20 staff attacked during an outbreak of violence at the weekend at Feltham YOI in west London. One officer suffered a broken nose and another was concussed after being repeatedly punched. The Prison Service said the assaults were ""completely unacceptable"". Several members of staff were bitten during the disturbance in the section of the YOI known as Feltham A which accommodates 150 boys, most of whom are aged 16 and 17. The other part of the facility, Feltham B, holds young offenders aged 18 to 21. Violence took place in the section of the YOI known as Feltham A A prison minibus was used to drive injured officers to hospital - they were all later discharged. The prisoners involved will face adjudication hearings in the next 72 hours and could be referred to the police. A Prison Service spokesperson said: ""We will never tolerate violence against our staff and will push for the strongest possible punishment, which could lead to them spending more time behind bars."" It also offered its sympathies to the ""hard-working and committed"" staff who were caught up in the violence. Feltham A manages young people on remand and those who have been sentenced by the courts Mark Fairhurst, chairman of the Prison Officers' Association (POA), said violence had been escalating at Feltham for a number of weeks partly due to changes in the way it deals with inmates who misbehave. Until December last year, they could be locked in a cell in the segregation block, known as the Care, Separation and Reintegration Unit, which is located in Feltham B. But after the High Court ruled in 2017 that a 16-year-old had been held unlawfully in the block, and inspectors described the regime there as ""impoverished"" and ""punitive"", its use for younger boys was reduced and eventually stopped. Mr Fairhurst criticised the decision saying the lack of effective punishments for the most challenging prisoners was putting staff at risk. ""We shouldn't be afraid to use sanctions,"" he said. He tweeted that the POA would ""support staff and push for prosecutions"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

His members held meetings outside the jail on Monday to discuss their concerns and had talks with the Governor. As an alternative to segregation, a new section in Feltham A, known as the Falcon Unit, began operating in March to give the most challenging boys extra support. The Prison Service said it would contain ""calm down"" rooms by the end of the month. Last month, the Independent Monitoring Board, which carries out regular visits to Feltham, warned the government that it needed to take ""urgent measures"" to make Feltham safer after a rise in gang-related violence. In its annual report it said: ""It is clear from talking to prisoners and staff that many prisoner-on-prisoner assaults and multi-prisoner fights are 'organised' and happen as a result of gang activity on the outside.""

"Prisoners have been learning new skills by working on Inside TV A prison TV channel run by inmates that has featured a drama showing the impact of crime on victims has been praised by inspectors. Inside TV, which is led by prisoners at HMP Lowdham Grange in Nottinghamshire, aims to give new skills to criminals and steer them away from reoffending. Other programmes have included a cookery show, games reviews and items on drugs and Islamist extremism. Aninspection in January,externaldescribed the channel as ""a well-resourced facility"". Inside TV was praised by inspectors In January HMP Lowdham Grange - a category B prison run by private company Serco that can hold up to 920 inmates - was criticised by inspectors after it found the use of force by officers had doubled since 2015. However, inspectors praised a photo booth allowing inmates to take pictures with family members during visits. Inmates can watch Inside TV from their cells As well as providing programming for prisoners, staff can use the channel to issue newsflash alerts if the prison enters lockdown. Prison director Mark Hanson said the channel ""helps us to be able to communicate effectively with the prison population"" and gives inmates the chance to learn practical skills that benefit them once they leave prison. Prison director Mark Hanson said the jail's job was to rehabilitate prisoners so they stopped committing crimes ""The get valuable communication skills and they actually get a qualification,"" he said. ""Our job is to rehabilitate [prisoners], and part of that rehabilitation journey has got to be about giving them skills, giving them hope and aspirations so that when they're released from prison they're less likely to commit a crime.""

"This video can not be played Clutha helicopter crash: how the events unfolded Eyewitnesses have described hearing noises coming from a police helicopter before it crashed into the Clutha pub. The final seconds of the flight in Glasgow city centre on 29 November 2013 were described at the opening day of a hearing into the tragedy. Statements on behalf of six of the 10 victims were also read out after a minute's silence was observed. The Fatal Accident Inquiry heard from a number of people, including a taxi driver and pedestrians. Pilot David Traill, 51; PC Tony Collins, 43; and PC Kirsty Nelis, 36, lost their lives along with seven customers who were in the bar on Stockwell Street. They were Gary Arthur, 48; Joe Cusker, 59; Colin Gibson, 33; Robert Jenkins, 61; John McGarrigle, 58; Samuel McGhee, 56; and Mark O'Prey, 44. In his evidence, Ernest Docherty, 64, told the inquiry - which is being held in a temporary court at Hampden Park football ground - that the Police Scotland helicopter ""was like an old car trying to start but a thousand times louder"". The retired transport worker said the noise grew louder as it flew overhead, causing him to hunch in the street. (Top: left to right) David Traill; PC Kirsty Nelis; PC Tony Collins; Gary Arthur; Samuel McGhee (Bottom: left to right) Colin Gibson; Robert Jenkins; Mark O'Prey; John McGarrigle; Joe Cusker Andrew Bergen, 30, was walking along the river bank when he saw the helicopter flying normally. The solicitor added: ""It made what I can only describe as a spluttering noise."" Mr Bergen said the helicopter's tail dipped and pointed toward the ground. He went on: ""Simultaneously the lights went out and it seemed to me that the rotor stopped spinning. It was still turning but not under power."" Taxi driver Tariq Malik, 41, was having a cigarette in the car park of the Grand Mosque on the opposite side of the river Clyde, when he spotted the helicopter. He recalled it was a clear night and everything initially seemed normal until it suddenly lost power. He told the court: ""All I could hear was a swooshing sound as it fell through the sky."" Christopher Jarvie, 36, described a ""stuttering noise"" while Brian Stewart, 50, said the sound from the helicopter was similar to a car stalling. Another witness, Craig Welsh, 42, talked of hearing a ""whining sound and then there were two distinct thuds"". The police helicopter crashed into The Clutha roof on 29 November 2013 Earlier, statements from six of the families of those killed were read out by their legal representatives. Testimonies came from the families of Mr McGhee, Mr Arthur, Mr Jenkins, Mr Gibson, Mr McGarrigle and Mr O'Prey. No statement was provided by relatives of Mr Cusker or the pilot and his two crew. Mr McGhee's daughter Kerry told how her father was born and bred in Castlemilk. The bus driver had to take early retirement to care for his partner, who died of cancer in 2007. She wrote: ""He was a good friend, neighbour and a sad loss to our close-knit community."" Colin Gibson was celebrating a friend's birthday on the night of the tragedy. He had never been in the bar before. In a statement, his family said: ""We will never know what he would have went on to achieve. He just happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time."" This video can not be played Families of Clutha victims on fatal accident inquiry Mark O'Prey's father, Ian, said his ""wonderful son"" had ""many virtues"" and ""loved life and lived it to the full"". He thanked the hearing for the minute's silence, but said added: ""After five and a half years of silence from the Crown Office it is of no consequence to me personally."" Mary Kavanagh's partner, 61-year-old Robert Jenkins, was the oldest to die. Donald Findlay QC read out a statement on behalf of Ms Kavanagh, which said the father-of-two had many friends and was a keen football fan who would have loved to work at the Scottish Football Museum, based at Hampden Park. He said: ""Mary finds it very ironic that the FAI is taking place at a venue that Robert held in such high esteem."" Mary Kavanagh last saw her partner, Robert Jenkins, when he went to the bar to buy her a drink The couple were in The Clutha on the night of the disaster. She last saw Mr Jenkins as he went to the bar to buy her a cranberry juice. Mr Findlay concluded: ""All Mary wants to know is why she went into the bar with the man she was going to spend the rest of her life with and came out alone."" Follow the BBC's Paul O'Hare who is tweeting from the inquiry,external Clutha survivor: 'Going back to pub helped my recovery' Date announced for Clutha helicopter crash inquiry Clutha families 'punished again' over FAI The sisters of Gary Arthur described him as a ""joker"" and a ""loveable rogue"", and said the disaster had robbed him of so much. Their statement concluded: ""Nothing will ever bring our brother back, but hopefully we will be given the chance to have closure over the last five years and remember Gary as a much loved person and not just a victim from The Clutha."" John McGarrigle's son, John, described his father as his ""hero"". The court heard he was a writer and a Clutha regular who always used to sit in the same seat. The statement said: ""His talent was immense and his take on things was wry and humorous."" More than 100 people were in the bar when the Police Scotland helicopter crashed through the roof at 22:22. As well as the 10 who died, 31 people were injured. The Eurocopter EC 135, operated by Bond Air Services, had been returning to its base on the banks of the River Clyde. The inquiry will not sit every day and is expected to hear about three months' worth of evidence between now and August. The first four weeks will involve eyewitnesses and representatives of the the Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) and Airbus. In October 2015 areport from the AAIBconcluded the pilot did not follow emergency protocol and flew on despite low fuel warnings. It also found fuel transfer pumps were turned off and a controlled landing was not achieved for ""unknown reasons"". And it recommended all police helicopters be equipped with black box flight recording equipment.

"The Labour Party's negotiating team includes Rebecca Long Bailey and Sir Keir Starmer ""Are they serious?"" Labour and the Conservatives are separately pondering that same question tonight - wondering whether their political rivals really are genuine about finding common cause. Guess what, just for a change, the leaderships of both of the main Westminster parties are dealing with boiling tensions on their front and back benches. And they both have reasons to tiptoe towards each other in these cross-party talks, but both sides too have reasons to tread carefully. In truth, both sides are serious that they could possibly get serious about a deal, but the obstacles are significant. The Tories have still not, and may never feel able to offer a clear promise of pursuing a customs union. What sources familiar with the talks say the focus is right now, is trying to point out to Labour that the existing deal contains the possibility of shaping that kind of arrangement in the future. Irony upon irony, the backstop which the government has been protesting about for so long provides the ingredients for exactly that kind of relationship with the EU in the long term. That is precisely why Brexiteers hated it so much - because they feared (correctly perhaps) it might be used as the basis on which to build the kind of tight trading deal with the EU they seek to avoid. What are the Brexit sticking points? Sturgeon warns about 'bad Brexit compromise' For the prime minister to overtly pursue such a deal is already provoking fury in parts of her party - although it's also striking now how frustrated some middle of the road Tory MPs are - fed up of what they see as both ""extremes"", hogging the oxygen and holding everything up. But unless and until Theresa May is ready to give a firmer commitment on customs, it is hard to see how Labour would be ready to sign on the dotted line. Although the two sides will meet again in the next 24 hours, Jeremy Corbyn again has expressed his view that the government hasn't shifted any of those red lines. And even if that were to happen, there are (at least!) two other big blocks to success. There is deep anxiety in the Labour Party about being able to trust anything that is agreed. The government's already promised that they could change the law to give guarantees in the Brexit implementation bill. But both sides admit privately even if they came up with some kind of ""lock"", it's just not feasible to rule out any future prime minister ever unpicking the deal. In a different era this might not be such a problem. But the prime minister has already said that she will quit, and quit once the deal is done. So of course, Labour MPs are very nervous about how the promises made in these talks could last. That's whether the next leader were to be Boris Johnson, Dominic Raab , Jeremy Hunt or frankly, the Queen of Sheba - it's about the permanence of any promise. And, as I understand it, the two groups, even with serious intention, have not as things stand been able to come up with a formula that guards against this. Second of all, officials and politicians in the discussions have talked about the possibility of another referendum on the EU - whether you call it a ""confirmatory vote"", a ""ratificatory referendum"", or a ""people's vote"" - another chance for all of us to have a say. This has not though yet been a big focus of the talks - it seems like an issue that has been danced around the edges. Will Labour push for a public vote? Labour chair offered to quit over Brexit Here's the thing: a hefty chunk of the Labour Party is adamant that they will only back a deal if it comes with a promise of another referendum. And that opinion among Labour backbenchers has been hardening, not softening in recent weeks. So even if the talks can find away around the customs conundrum, and then find a ""lock"" to make Labour comfortable with any promises that are made, there is a third profound dilemma. Number 10 has always made it abundantly clear that the prime minister believes that's a nightmare not worth contemplating. The problem for these talks is that for a big chunk of the parliamentary Labour Party that's the dream they are pursuing. There are others who disagree, and disagree profoundly. But in terms of making this process work, the Labour Party's votes can't be delivered in one big chunk. With huge political imagination, invention, (whose mother after all they say is a necessity, and there's certainly a necessity right now), it is of course possible that this process could get there. In this long tangled process a lot of things that have seemed impossible can in the end come to pass. But just as both sides in these talks are serious, the problems are serious too.

"The US has sanctioned parts of the IRGC before US President Donald Trump has designated Iran's elite Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) as a foreign terrorist organisation. It is the first time the US has labelled another nation's military as a terrorist organisation. Iran retaliated by declaring US forces in the Middle East as a terrorist organisation, Iran state news reported. Washington-Tehran tensions have risen since Mr Trump withdrew the US from the international Iran nuclear pact. Labelling the Guards as a terrorist organisation will allow the US to impose further sanctions - particularly affecting the business sector, given the IRGC's involvement in Iran's economy. A number of IRGC and affiliated entities have already been targeted by US sanctions for alleged proliferation activities, support for terrorism and human rights abuses. Profile: Iran's Revolutionary Guards Mr Trump's statement on Monday said: ""This unprecedented step, led by the Department of State, recognises the reality that Iran is not only a State Sponsor of Terrorism, but that the IRGC actively participates in, finances, and promotes terrorism as a tool of statecraft."" This video can not be played Pompeo announces the ""historic step"" against Iran's Revolutionary Guards Corp The president added that the move was meant to ""significantly expand the scope and scale"" of pressure on Iran. ""If you are doing business with the IRGC, you will be bankrolling terrorism,"" Mr Trump said. The measure will take effect in one week's time, according to the State Department. US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and National Security Adviser John Bolton, both Iran hawks, championed the decision, but not all US officials were so supportive. Mr Pompeo told reporters on Monday the US will continue to sanction and pressure Iran to ""behave like a normal nation"" and urged America's allies to take similar action. ""The leaders of Iran are not revolutionaries and people deserve better,"" Mr Pompeo said. ""They are opportunists."" In a later tweet, he added: ""We must help the people of Iran get back their freedom."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

But some Pentagon officials, including Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Gen Joe Dunford, had expressed concerns about troop safety,the Wall Street Journal reported,external. Military officials cautioned the designation could incite violence against US forces in the Middle East without severely impacting Iran's economy. The Central Intelligence Agency had also reportedly opposed the move. Iran's national security council declared US Central Command (Centcom) a terrorist organisation after Foreign Minister Javad Zarif wrote to President Hassan Rouhani urging such a response, state news channel IRINN said. Centcom is the Pentagon wing that oversees Washington's security interests across the central area of the world map, most notably Afghanistan, Iraq, Iran, Pakistan and Syria. The Islamic Republic had warned it would retaliate in kind last week, after reports of the Trump administration plan first surfaced. ""We will answer any action taken against this force with a reciprocal action,"" a statement issued by 255 out of the 290 Iranian MPs said, according to the state-run IRNA news agency. But Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who is battling for political survival in Tuesday's elections, cheered the US move. Allow Twitter content?

This move underscores the Trump administration's desire to isolate and stigmatise Iran, though it is unlikely to have a significant impact upon the Revolutionary Guard Corps' activities. Few Western commentators would disagree that the IRGC is responsible for all sorts of disruptive activities in the region and beyond. But many - including it seems some officials in the US Department of State and the Pentagon  - fear that this step could simply backfire. The fear is that it could encourage the IRGC or its proxies to take action against US personnel or other targets in places where they might be vulnerable, for example in Iraq.

It has since become a major military, political and economic force in Iran, with close ties to the Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, and many other senior figures hailing from its ranks. The IRGC is estimated to have more than 150,000 active personnel, boasts its own ground forces, navy and air force, and oversees Iran's strategic weapons, including its ballistic missiles. The IRGC exerts influence elsewhere in the Middle East by providing money, weapons, technology, training and advice to allied governments and armed groups through its shadowy overseas operations arm, the Quds (Jerusalem) Force.
