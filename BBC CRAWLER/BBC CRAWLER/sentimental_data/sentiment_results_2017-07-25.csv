"New diesel and petrol cars and vans will be banned in the UK from 2040 in a bid to tackle air pollution, the government has announced. Ministers have also unveiled a Â£255m fund to help councils tackle emissions, including the potential for charging zones for the dirtiest vehicles. Butthe Â£3bn clean air strategy,externaldoes not include a scrappage scheme, calling previous ones ""poor value"" for money. Local government leaders welcomed the funding but called for more detail. Reality Check: Does pollution cut short 40,000 lives a year? Questions about the petrol and diesel car ban Special Report: So I can breathe Local authorities will be given direct financial support from the government, with Â£40m of the fund being made immediately. They can use the funds for a range of measures, such as changing road layouts, implementing new technologies or encouraging residents on to public transport. If those measures do not cut emissions enough, charging zones could be the next step - but the government says these should only be used for ""limited periods"". The timetable for councils to come up with initial plans has been cut from 18 months to eight, with the Department for Environment, Farming and Rural Affairs (Defra) wanting to ""inject additional urgency"" into the process. It follows the government being given its own deadline of 31 July after High Court judges said it was failing to meet EU pollution limits. Other points include: The funding pot will come from changes to tax on diesel vehicles and reprioritising departmental budgets - the exact details will be announced later in the year. Councils could change road layouts, retrofit public transport, and encourage local people to leave their cars at home. A Clean Air Fund would allow local authorities to bid for additional money to put in more air quality control measures. A new Automated and Electric Vehicles Bill will allow the government to require the installation of charge points for electric vehicles at motorway service areas and large fuel retailers. Local Government Association environment spokesman Martin Tett said the plans to allow councils to switch their focus from monitoring air quality to improving air quality was the right move and welcomed the additional funding. However, he opposed the view of the government to hold off on a scrappage scheme, arguing ""this immediate intervention could help increase the uptake of lower emission vehicles"". Ministers have been wary of being seen to ""punish"" drivers of diesel cars, who, they argue, bought the vehicles after being encouraged to by the last Labour government because they produced lower carbon emissions. The industry trade body, the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, said it was important to avoid outright bans on diesels, which would hurt the sector. SMMT chief executive Mike Hawes said demand for alternatively fuelled vehicles was growing but still at a very low level. ""The industry instead wants a positive approach which gives consumers incentives to purchase these cars. We could undermine the UK's successful automotive sector if we don't allow enough time for the industry to adjust."" The AA said significant investment would be needed to install charging points across the country and warned the National Grid would come under pressure with a mass switch-on of recharging after the rush hour. The UK announcement comes amid signs of an accelerating shift towards electric cars instead of petrol and diesel ones, at home and abroad: Earlier this month,President Emmanuel Macron announced similar plans to phase out diesel and petrol cars in France, also from 2040. BMW announced on Tuesday that afully electric version of the Mini would be built at the Cowley plant in Oxford from 2019. Swedish carmakerVolvo has said all new models will have an electric motor from the same year. By Roger Harrabin, BBC environment analyst So how will the air be cleaned up? Plans for a diesel scrappage scheme for old vehicles have been rejected by the Treasury as poor value for money. They may be reconsidered in the autumn. The government has told councils to solve pollution on their own streets by improving public transport and considering restrictions on dirty diesel vehicles at peak times. If that doesn't work, councils will be told to charge diesel drivers to come into towns. The councils aren't happy to take the rap for the controversial policy when it was the government that encouraged the sale of diesel vehicles in the first place. Today's government plan is not comprehensive - it doesn't address pollution from construction, farming and gas boilers. And clean air campaigners say the government is using the 2040 electric cars announcement to distract from failings in its short-term pollution policy. Read more analysis from Roger Air pollution is thought to be linked to about 40,000 premature deaths a year in the UK, and transport also contributes to greenhouse gas emissions. A government spokesman said poor air quality was ""the biggest environmental risk"" to public health in the UK. The measures are ""good"" in the long term but ""not very effective"" in the short, industry expert David Bailey said. A switch-over to electric cars would likely come in the mid-2020s, he predicted, when electric cars would out-compete petrol and diesel ones on factors like cost. ""This sets a very clear direction of travel, but petrol and diesel cars won't exist by 2040,"" he said. He said more incentives were needed now, otherwise urban air quality would not improve. Environmental law firm ClientEarth welcomed the measures, but said it wanted to see more detail. Chief executive James Thornton said the law found ministers must bring down illegal levels of air pollution as soon as possible. Green Party MP Caroline Lucas welcomed a ban but said it did not go ""nearly far enough or fast enough"". Friends of the Earth said the plan was a ""cynical"" move which passed the buck of saving lives to local authorities. Labour said the government was only acting after being taken to court. Environment, Food and Rural Affairs spokeswoman Sue Hayman MP said the government had a ""squeamish"" attitude to clear air zones, and was shunting the problem on to local authorities. ""With nearly 40 million people living in areas with illegal levels of air pollution, action is needed now, not in 23 years' time,"" she said.

"Humans could become extinct if sperm counts in men continue to fall at current rates, a doctor has warned. Researchers assessing the results of nearly 200 studies say sperm counts among men from North America, Europe, Australia, and New Zealand, seem to have halved in less than 40 years. Some experts are sceptical of theHuman Reproduction Update,externalfindings. But lead researcher Dr Hagai Levine said he was ""very worried"" about what might happen in the future. The assessment, one of the largest ever undertaken, brings together the results of 185 studies between 1973 and 2011. Dr Levine, an epidemiologist, told the BBC that if the trend continued humans would become extinct. ""If we will not change the ways that we are living and the environment and the chemicals that we are exposed to, I am very worried about what will happen in the future,"" he said. ""Eventually we may have a problem, and with reproduction in general, and it may be the extinction of the human species."" Scientists not involved in the study have praised the quality of the research but say that it may be premature to come to such a conclusion. Dr Levine, from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, found a 52.4% decline in sperm concentration, and a 59.3% decline in total sperm count in men from North America, Europe, Australia and New Zealand. The study also indicates the rate of decline among men living in these countries is continuing and possibly even increasing. In contrast, no significant decline was seen in South America, Asia and Africa, but the researchers point out that far fewer studies have been conducted on these continents. However, Dr Levine is concerned that eventually sperm counts could fall in these places too. Many previous studies have indicated similar sharp declines in sperm count in developed economies, but sceptics say that a large proportion of them have been flawed. Some have investigated a relatively small number of men, or included only men who attend fertility clinics and are, in any case, more likely to have low sperm counts. There is also concern that studies that claim to show a decline in sperm counts are more likely to get published in scientific journals than those that do not. Another difficulty is that early methods of counting sperm may have overestimated the true count. Taken together these factors may have created a false view of falling sperm counts. But the researchers claim to have accounted for some of these deficiencies, leaving some doubters, such as Prof Allan Pacey of Sheffield University, less sceptical. He said: ""I've never been particularly convinced by the many studies published so far claiming that human sperm counts have declined in the recent past."" ""However, the study today by Dr Levine and his colleagues deals head-on with many of the deficiencies of previous studies."" But Prof Pacey believes that although the new study has reduced the possibility of errors it does not entirely remove them. So, he says, the results should be treated with caution. ""The debate has not yet been resolved and there is clearly much work still to be done. ""However, the paper does represent a step forward in the clarity of the data which might ultimately allow us to define better studies to examine this issue."" There is no clear evidence for the reason for this apparent decrease. But it has been linked with exposure to chemicals used in pesticides and plastics, obesity, smoking, stress,diet, and evenwatching too much TV. Dr Levine says that there is an urgent need to find out why sperm counts are decreasing and to find ways of reversing the trend. ""We must take action - for example, better regulation of man-made chemicals - and we must continue our efforts on tackling smoking and obesity.""

"This video can not be played John McCain returned to the Senate to applause The US Senate has rejected a Republican plan to replace President Barack Obama's signature healthcare policy. The 57-43 vote defeat marks the start of a days-long debate on a sweeping overhaul that critics fear could deny healthcare to millions of Americans. The Better Care Reconciliation Act (BRCA) was crafted over two months but attention now turns to other options. President Donald Trump has urged senators to pass a bill, without indicating which one he supports. A repeal-only bill, which would consign so-called Obamacare to history in two years, to give time to Republicans to devise a replacement, could be debated and voted on next. But that measure - which non-partisan analysts say will take health insurance from more than 30 million people - has already failed to win enough support in the Republican party. Other attempts to replace Obamacare have collapsed in recent weeks due to divisions in the party. President Trump had made scrapping the policy a key campaign pledge. He says the system is ""torturing"" Americans. He secured a victory on Tuesday when the Senate agreed to allow the debate on health care legislation reform to go forward, but only after Republican Vice-President Mike Pence cast the tie-breaking vote in support of the bill. Obamacare v Republican plan compared 'Don't take away our healthcare' says Trump country Senator John McCain, who was recently diagnosed with an aggressive brain tumour, received a standing ovation as he returned to Congress to cast his ""Yes"" vote. President Trump tweeted,externalhis thanks to the Arizona senator for playing ""such a vital role"" in the vote. But in anearly morning tweet on Wednesday,external, Mr Trump lambasted Senator Lisa Murkowski of Alaska for opposing the Republican plan. The key repeal-and-replace bill, the BCRA, has fallen by the wayside. Next could be a repeal-only bill with a two-year delay, in the hope of finding agreement before that time elapses. But senators will also consider a ""skinny bill"", a far narrower measure that would scale back some of the more controversial elements in an effort to get a wider consensus. A special Senate-House of Representatives committee would then be tasked with finalising a bill that could still see changes during negotiations. If successful, the full House and Senate would again have to approve the measure. US Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price told CNBC on Wednesday that Senate Republicans should aim for the ""lowest common denominator"" to secure the 50 votes need to pass a bill. Republicans have long railed against Obamacare as government overreach, criticising the system for introducing government-run marketplaces, where premiums have risen sharply for some people. The party's proposed alternative includes steep cuts to Medicaid, a healthcare programme for the poor and disabled. Mitch McConnell said senators had ""a duty to act"" And it removes Obamacare's individual mandate requiring all Americans to have health insurance or pay a tax penalty. About 20 million people gained health insurance under former President Obama's Affordable Care Act. The non-partisan Congressional Budgetary Office (CBO) found the bill would strip 22 million Americans of health insurance over the next decade. If Republican senators elect to repeal key provisions of the law without immediately replacing it, the CBO estimates about 32 million consumers would lose insurance over the next 10 years.

"Both fly-half Paddy Jackson and centre Stuart Olding deny the allegations Two Ulster rugby stars are among four men to be prosecuted for offences relating to allegations of rape, the BBC understands. Paddy Jackson and Stuart Olding were arrested in June 2016 with two other men, and questioned about allegations of a sexual assault in south Belfast. The PPS confirmed a decision has been taken to prosecute four men in relation to allegations of rape. Both Mr Jackson, 25, and Mr Olding, 24, deny the allegations. The Public Prosecution Service said: ""Following a careful review of all of the available evidence, in accordance with our Code for Prosecutors, it has been decided that there is sufficient evidence to prosecute four individuals."" Solicitors representing Mr Jackson and Mr Olding confirmed their clients are to be prosecuted for alleged rape. Another man is to be charged with a sexual offence and a fourth man is to be charged with intent to pervert the course of justice. Solicitor Joe Rice, representing Stuart Olding said: ""I would like to point out that my client has fully co-operated with the investigation and is not on any bail conditions and is of previous good character. ""He should be allowed to uphold his right to the presumption of innocence and rejects any allegation of wrong-doing and is confident his name will be cleared through the courts."" In a similar statement, Paddy Jackson's solicitor Kevin Winters said: ""He rejects the allegations completely and we're very disappointed at the PPS decision to prosecute on these particular facts."" ""We say there is no basis for the decision to prosecute and we are confident that our client will be cleared of any charge."" The PPS statement added: ""As the criminal proceedings against these individuals have commenced and each has a right to a fair trial, it is extremely important that there should be no reporting, commentary or sharing of information online which could in any way prejudice proceedings."" All four men are due to appear in court next month. The Irish Rugby Football Union and Ulster Rugby said the players have agreed that they be relieved of their duties and obligations until the conclusion of the legal process, to allow them time to address the matter fully.

"Theresa and Philip May are in northern Italy before heading to Switzerland It's that time of year when politicians get a break. But where to go, what to do?  Here's a guide to organising a prime ministerial summer holiday... Theresa May, who must be relishing a break from trying to keep order in her cabinet, is spending a few days at Lake Garda in northern Italy with husband Philip. She'll then return for an engagement before heading to Switzerland for a two-week walking break. It will probably look a bit like this: Theresa and Philip May walking in Switzerland last year Switzerland - it's in Europe, but is pretty neutral in Brexit terms - was also a destination of choice for ex-PM Margaret Thatcher. When she went walking in Snowdonia in April, Mrs May decided to call the snap general election that ended up losing the Conservatives their majority. What effect will the mountain air have this time? Cornwall is a firm favourite of prime ministers - particularly David Cameron, who frequently holidayed there: The Blairs also visited Cornwall on vacation Margaret Thatcher on a rare break - also in Cornwall Ted Heath liked venturing out to sea Harold Wilson was a fan of the Scilly Isles In August 2003 Tony Blair stayed in Sir Cliff Richard's Barbados holiday home. The singer later revealed he had offered the Caribbean villa, where Mr Blair and his family stayed for three weeks, because the prime minister looked so ""gaunt and tired"" as debate raged about the Iraq war. Tony Blair holidayed with a bandana-wearing Silvio Berlusconi in Sardinia in 2004 Tony Blair and family stayed at Geoffrey Robinson's Tuscan villa in 1997 The following year Mr Blair stayed at the Sardinian villa of Italian counterpart Silvio Berlusconi, reportedlyleaving him hobbling,externalafter a challenge in a ""friendly"" football match. Another Italian villa he stayed at was in Tuscany, and owned by Labour MP and former paymaster general Geoffrey Robinson. Mr Cameron'smuch-documented,externalhabit of posing for photographs pointing at fish is an easy one to replicate. This one was in Portugal in 2013. This video can not be played David Cameron filmed tucking into crisps on budget flight Fairly standard behaviour for most of us -  and two years ago, on an Easyjet flight to Portugal, David Cameron might have thought he was away from prying eyes as he tucked into a tube of Pringles. Twitter, and in particular a teenager called Ashleigh whoposted footageof the apparently oblivious PM, thought otherwise. ""Guys I'm crying he was eating Pringles,"" she informed her followers. This one's a bit harder to achieve - but former Conservative prime minister Sir John Major managed it in 2013 in the Spanish town of Candeleda. Local politicians voted to name the Avenida de John Major in honour of his annual holiday visits during his time in Downing Street. Sir John was invited to the naming ceremony in the town, 100 miles from Madrid, which he described as one of the ""jewels"" of Spain. In 2008 Labour Prime Minister Gordon Brown was under pressure after his party's shock defeat in the Glasgow East by-election, and his summer holiday didn't get off to a very relaxing start at a Norfolk country park as he fielded reporters' questions about his future. ""I think everybody's ready for a holiday at this time of year,"" he told them. The PM's formal choice of attire - beige jacket and dark trousers - was markedly different to the then Tory leader David Cameron's barefoot appearance on a Cornish beach. ""It might not quite have been a scene from Baywatch but the contrast with Mr Brown could scarcely have been greater,"" theDaily Telegraph noted,external. But once he became prime minister, Mr Cameron's holiday fashion often came under fire. In 2013 his outfit, including loafers without socks, was branded a ""sartorial shocker"" by theDaily Mail,external's Quentin Letts. Tipping etiquette can be confusing in foreign countries - and when David Cameron and wife Samantha didn't leave one after paying for their cappuccinos in an Italian cafe in 2011, it did not go unnoticed. The PM returned to the Dolcenero cafe in Montevarchi, Tuscany, leaving a healthy tip to make amends. The waitress told reporters Mr Cameron had apologised for any fuss the incident had caused. The news doesn't stop coming during the summer holidays, and prime ministers have frequently had to cut short their trips as events intervened. David Cameron returned home from Italy in 2011 as riots broke out in London, and Gordon Brown abandoned his 2007 trip to Dorset after just a few hours to chair crisis talks over foot-and-mouth disease. Even without returning home, prime ministers have to be ready to act from their holiday homes. With stories of plotting ministers in the newspapers, Mr Cameron's former head of political press, Giles Kenningham, says Mrs May needs to find a way to ""assert herself"" and avoid a ""vacuum"" while she's away. ""She needs to be visible when she's abroad,"" he says.

"A post-mortem examination revealed the cause of Celine Dookhran's death was a neck wound Tributes have been paid to a 20-year-old woman who was allegedly kidnapped and raped before being killed. Celine Dookhran's body was found at an address in Coombe Lane West, in Kingston Upon Thames, on Wednesday. Prosecutors allege Mujahid Arshid, 33, murdered the teenager - who was of Indian Muslim heritage - for being in a relationship with an Arab Muslim. One user on Facebook said: ""RIP Celine. Such a beautiful, intelligent soul."" Ms Dookhran, who was born in Wandsworth and grew up in south London, had a passion for make-up and offered cosmetic advice to her followers on social media. Her social media messages included posts about religious holidays and fasting during Ramadan. The last tweet, posted eight days before her death, said ""Alhamdulillah [praise God] for everything that's all I can say"". Following the news of her death, one of her Twitter followers said: ""Innalillahe wainna ilaye rajeeon [""We belong to Allah and to Him we shall return.""] ""RIP Celine, You did not deserve what has happened, May Allah grant you a place in Paradise. Inshallah."" While another user posted: ""RIP Celine, you were very beautiful and you will never be forgotten."" Ms Dookhran had a passion for make-up and offered cosmetic advice to her Twitter followers Mr Arshid is also accused of the kidnap, rape and attempted murder of a woman in her 20s. The second woman, who cannot be identified for legal reasons, had earlier been treated for stab or slash wounds at a south London hospital. Vincent Tappu, 28, from Acton, west London, is also charged with kidnapping both women. A post-mortem examination revealed the cause of Ms Dookhran's death was a neck wound. Police found the body of the 20-year-old at a property in Kingston Upon Thames The men have been remanded in custody. Mr Arshid, of no fixed address, is scheduled to appear at the Old Bailey on 26 July. Both defendants will appear at the same court on 21 August.

"Connie Yates and Chris Gard's lawyer said Great Ormond Street Hospital was obstructing attempts to take Charlie home Moving Charlie Gard to a hospice to die would be the best option for the terminally-ill baby, a court has heard. The 11-month-old's parents had returned to the High Court to seek permission to take him home for ""a few days of tranquillity outside the hospital"". But Great Ormond Street Hospital (GOSH) said there were practical problems with that proposal, for example his ventilation equipment would not be able to fit through their front door. The judge will rule on Wednesday. At Tuesday's hearing, the judge said hospital managers had suggested a hospice would give Charlie and his parents the space, privacy and protection they needed. Chris Gard and Connie Yates have pleaded for a paediatric intensive care doctor to come forward to help their son die at home. ""We promised Charlie every day we would take him home. It seems really upsetting after everything we've been through to deny us this,"" Ms Yates said. Grant Armstrong, representing the parents, told Mr Justice Francis that his clients' ""last wish is that Charlie dies at home"". He suggested a portable ventilator and oxygen supply could be used but accused GOSH of ""putting up obstacles"". This video can not be played Chris Gard: ""We are so sorry we could not save you"" Lawyers for the hospital told the judge they ""would like to be able to fulfil the parents' wishes... if it is safe and practicable and in Charlie's best interests"". However, Katie Gollop QC, who leads the hospital's legal team, said providing intensive care for Charlie away from a hospital was not simple. Charlie's condition requires air to be forced into his lungs. She said as far as the hospital was aware invasive ventilation was only provided in a hospital setting. Ms Gollop said Charlie would need to be ""monitored by an ITU trained nurse at all times, with an ITU doctor on call and close at hand"". Such resources ""cannot be provided by GOSH to Charlie at his parents' home"", she said. Charlie has been in intensive care at Great Ormond Street Hospital since October Mr Justice Francis said: ""If going home can be achieved within reason then I would like to achieve that for them."" He said he would make a final decision, about whether Charlie can be taken home, at 14:00 BST on Wednesday. Charlie's parents, from Bedfont, west London, said they had been spending their ""last precious moments"" with their son. Charlie's medical case explained Death threats sent to Great Ormond Street Hospital staff Charlie has encephalomyopathic mitochondrial DNA depletion syndrome. He has brain damage and cannot move his arms or legs. His parents had asked Mr Justice Francis to rule that their son should be allowed to undergo a trial of nucleoside therapy in New York, a move opposed by medics at GOSH who argued the treatment would be ""futile"". The Family Division of the High Court heard on Monday that US neurologist Professor Michio Hirano was no longer willing to offer the experimental therapy after he had seen the results of a new MRI scan. In astatement to the High Court,external, GOSH said Professor Michio Hirano had not taken the opportunity to see Charlie until last week, despite being offered the chance to do so by the hospital in January. The hospital said it was also concerned the professor had declared a financial interest in some of the treatment he had proposed prescribing for Charlie. Timeline of legal battle 3 March 2017: Mr Justice Francis starts to analyse the case at a hearing in the Family Division of the High Court in London. 11 April: Mr Justice Francis says doctors can stop providing life-support treatment. 3 May: Charlie's parents ask Court of Appeal judges to consider the case. 23 May: Three Court of Appeal judges analyse the case. 25 May: Court of Appeal judges dismiss the couple's appeal. 8 June: Charlie's parents lose fight in the Supreme Court. 20 June: Judges in the European Court of Human Rights start to analyse the case after lawyers representing Charlie's parents make written submissions. 27 June: Judges in the European Court of Human Rights refuse to intervene. 3 July: The Pope and US President Donald Trump offer to intervene. 7 July: Great Ormond Street Hospital applies for a fresh hearing at the High Court. 24 July: Charlie's parents end their legal fight to take him to the US for treatment.

"A new image of suspect Franz Wrousis was issued by police on Tuesday A man who sparked one of the biggest manhunts in Swiss history after allegedly attacking people with a chainsaw has been arrested, police say. Franz Wrousis, 50, was arrested in Thalwil, a town about 60km (37 miles) from Schaffhausen, the border town where the incident took place. Mr Wrousis, who is said to have lived in the nearby woods, allegedly attacked two people in an insurance office. More than 100 Swiss and German officers were involved in the search. On Tuesday afternoon, after more than 24 hours on the run, Swiss police admitted they had no idea where Mr Wrousis had gone, and could have potentially crossed into Germany, A helicopter and dogs were used to scour the area for any trace of the alleged suspect, who has two previous convictions for weapons offences. Police eventually found him in Thalwil, just south of Zurich. No further details were available surrounding the arrest, but local media reported the police were due to hold a press conference early on Wednesday. Monday's attack unfolded shortly after 10:30 (08:30 GMT), when two workers were attacked and wounded by a chainsaw at the CSS insurance office. One was badly hurt and needed surgery in hospital. Two other people were treated for shock, while a third was slightly hurt during the ensuing police operation. Police said Mr Wrousis had been a customer of the firm.

"Adobe's Flash software is regularly updated to remove flaws that cyber-thieves exploit Adobe Systems has said that it plans to phase out its Flash Player plug-in by the end of 2020. The technology was once one of the most widely used ways for people to watch video clips and play games online. But it also attracted much criticism, particularly as flaws in its code meant it became a popular way for hackers to infect computers. In recent years,much of its functionality,externalhas been offered by the rival HTML5 technology. One of HTML5's benefits is that it can be used to make multimedia content available within webpages without requiring users to install and update a dedicated plug-in. Apple was one of Flash's most vocal critics. The late Steve Jobs oncewrote a public letter,externalabout its shortcomings, highlighting concerns about its reliability, security and performance. The plug-in was never supported by Apple's iOS mobile devices. Adobe's vice president of product development, Govind Balakrishnan, said the firm had chosen to end Flash because other technologies, such as HTML5, had ""matured enough and are capable enough to provide viable alternatives to the Flash player."" He added: ""Few technologies have had such a profound and positive impact in the internet era."" Apps developer Malcolm Barclay, who had worked on Flash in its early days, told the BBC: ""It fulfilled its promise for a while but it never saw the mobile device revolution coming and ultimately that's what killed it."" This video can not be played How long will Flash survive? When Adobe acquired Flash in its 2005 purchase of Macromedia, the technology was on more than 98% of personal computers. But on Chrome, now the most popular web browser, Flash's usage has fallen off dramatically. In 2014 it was used each day by 80% of desktop users,according to Google,external. The current figure is just 17%. ""This trend reveals that sites are migrating to open-web technologies, which are faster and more power-efficient than Flash,"" Google added. ""They're also more secure."" Google phased out full support for Flash software at the end of last year. Mr Balakrishnan said it did not expect the demise of Flash to affect profits at Adobe. ""We think the opportunity for Adobe is greater in a post-Flash world,"" he said. But the firm added that it remained committed to support Flash up until the end of 2020 ""as customers and partners put their migration plans into place"".

"Jehovah's Witness pamphlets For some former Jehovah's Witnesses, leaving the faith is not just the mark of losing your religion - it can also mean losing your loved ones. In many cases, friends and family are told to cut all ties with ex-believers, leaving them isolated and sometimes suicidal. ""I don't speak to any of my family,"" Sarah - not her real name - tells the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme. ""Because of being 'disfellowshipped', I can have no contact."" Last year, Sarah - in her 20s - was excluded by the Jehovah's Witnesses in a process known as ""disfellowshipping"", she says sparked by her refusal to live in an abusive relationship. She claims her partner at the time had been violent towards her, at one stage leaving her with broken ribs. Going to the police - and involving those from outside the religion - is heavily discouraged by Jehovah's Witnesses, she says, claiming that elders within the faith refused to punish her ex-partner's behaviour. It was only when work colleagues noticed the bruising, and convinced her not to put up with the abuse, that she says she fled the relationship. Sarah claims she was consequently disfellowshipped by the religion, and that her friends and family cut all ties with her. This is because Jehovah's Witnesses believe those outside the religion can be of detriment to their faith. In a statement the religious group told the BBC: ""If a baptised Witness makes a practice of breaking the Bible's moral code, and does not given evidence of stopping the practice, he or she will be shunned or disfellowshipped. ""When it comes to shunning, Witnesses take their instructions from the Bible and on this subject the Bible clearly states, 'Remove the wicked man from amongst yourselves.'"" The night she was disfellowshipped, Sarah says her mother refused to talk to her. Her father woke her up at 07:00 to kick her out of their home. Responding to Sarah's claims, the Jehovah's Witnesses said that while it could not comment on individual cases, ""violence, whether physical or emotional, is strongly condemned in the Bible and has no place in a Christian family"". Sarah and John (front of shot) told Victoria Derbyshire they had been shunned by their family and friends John - not his real name - became a Jehovah's Witness as a young child when his parents decided to join the religious group. But two years ago, he was disfellowshipped after he missed a Jehovah's Witness memorial service - seen in the religion as an important event. He had also begun to privately have doubts about some of the religion's teachings - questioning the faith's assertion that the end of the world is imminent, and that only 144,000 human beings will go to heaven. His view on the religion was also tarnished after ones of his friends died, when a blood transfusion - which is not allowed in the faith - might have saved him. ""It was a waste of a life,"" he says. John says he later discovered his wife had testified against him during the process that led to his disfellowship, which he believes placed a great strain on their relationship. He left the family home - living temporarily in tents and caravans. ""It was a very isolating time. I didn't have anyone, I felt quite suicidal,"" he says. He has now lost contact with his two adult children and siblings. ""Sometimes I send them a message saying, 'I love you, I'm still thinking of you.' But usually there's no response,"" he says. Terri O'Sullivan was kicked out of her home by her mother According to the Jehovah's Witnesses, the faith has more than 138,000 members in the UK, and more than eight million internationally. Terri O'Sullivan left the religion 17 years ago, aged 21, and was kicked out of her home by her mother. She now runs a support network for those who leave or are excluded from it. She says she is yet to find a former Jehovah's Witness who has not experienced depression, alcoholism, suicidal feelings or self-harm. She adds that while not everyone goes through a formal disfellowship when they leave, their relationships seldom go on unaffected. ""With some ex-Witnesses,"" she says, ""some of their families will still talk to them - but it will always be strained."" Jehovah's Witness recruitment drive in London in 1966 Founded in the US towards the end of the 19th Century, under the leadership of Charles Taze Russell. Headquarters of the movement in New York Although Christian-based, the group believes that the traditional Christian Churches have deviated from the true teachings of the Bible, and do not work in full harmony with God The traditional Christian Church does not regard the movement as a mainstream Christian denomination because it rejects the Christian doctrine of the Trinity Jehovah's Witnesses believe that humanity is now in the ""last days"" and that the final battle between good and evil will happen soon Find out more from BBC Religion Sarah says the loss of her closest family ties has been ""very, very difficult"" to cope with. She is engaged, and aware she is ""having to plan a wedding where your parents won't attend"". ""I would class myself as an orphan, which is quite sad,"" she says. Her support network comes from her friends at work. When she left the faith, she says, they ""rallied around"" her, in contrast to what she had expected. ""These people I'd been told [by the religion] were awful, were bad association, and God was going to smite them all at Armageddon. ""Yet these people opened up their homes."" Sarah is still, however, complimentary about most of the people within her former faith. ""There are good people in the religion, who believe they are saving people's lives [by spreading the faith's message],"" she says. ""I look back with some happy memories, because they were the last memories I have with my family and siblings. ""But then I do have to look back and feel a lot of heartbreak that I'm never going to be able to sit down with them for a Sunday meal again. ""When they die, I probably won't be invited to the funeral either."" Watch theVictoria Derbyshire programmeon weekdays between 09:00 and 11:00 on BBC Two and the BBC News channel.

"The electric vehicle will be based on the 3-door hatchback model A fully electric version of the Mini will be built at the Cowley plant in Oxford, BMW has said. The carmaker said,externalthe model would go into production in 2019, with Oxford the main ""production location"" for the Mini three-door model. However, the electric motor will be built in Germany before being shipped to Cowley for assembly. BMW said it had ""neither sought nor received"" any reassurances from the UK on post-Brexit trading arrangements. Last year, the government faced questions about the ""support and assurances"" given to Nissan before the company announced that new versions of its Qashqai and X-Trail would be made in the UK. And there have been reports that Toyota agreed to invest in the UK after receiving a letter reassuring the Japanese carmaker over post-Brexit arrangements. About 360,000 Minis are made each year, with more than 60% of them built at Oxford. But BMW has built up an alternative manufacturing base in the Netherlands amid concerns about Britain's suitability as an export hub after Brexit. BMW has warned about the damage of Brexit uncertainty, and in May chief executive Harald Krueger said the company had to remain ""flexible"" about production facilities. UK Business Secretary Greg Clark hailed BMW's announcement as a ""vote of confidence"" in government plans to make Britain ""the go-to place in the world for the next generation of vehicles"". On Monday, he set out plans to invest in development of battery technology in the UK. Mr Clark met BMW's head of sales and marketing, Ian Robertson, at the company's headquarters in Munich in January and March this year. The two also held meetings at Westminster in March and June. David Bailey, professor of industry at Aston University, said the true test of the global car industry's desire to invest in the UK would come next year: ""I don't think it [BMW's decision] tells us much about Brexit and the form of trade barriers we may face in the future. ""The big decisions will be about future models [which would have redesigned bodies], both at Mini and at companies like Vauxhall when they announce their new models in the next couple of years."" BMW says the economic case for building the electric mini in Oxford is compelling, and it's easy to see why. This is not a brand new car, redesigned from the ground up. It's a Mini, a 3-door hatchback, which will in many ways be identical to the cars already being built at the Cowley plant. The electric bit - the drivetrain, which includes the motor, gearbox and battery pack - will be assembled in Germany, and fixed to the rest of the car in the factory. So it makes sense to build this model at the same factory as the majority of existing Mini production. There is no need for a new factory or production line, meaning the size of the investment will be relatively small by auto-industry standards - in ""the tens of millions"", BMW says. There is a potential spanner in the works - the new car is due to go into production in 2019, months after the UK leaves the EU. With drivetrains being imported into the UK and many completed cars exported back to Europe, there's a risk costs could rise sharply if tariffs are introduced on cross-channel trade. But the company insists it can only make decisions based on the current economic realities. There has been no ""special deal"" done with the British government, it says - and nor has it asked for one. The German carmaker said the Mini announcement was part of a plan for electrified vehicles to account for between 15-25% of its sales by 2025. The electric Mini will be based on the company's 3-door hatchback model. However, BMW has yet to release pictures of a prototype vehicle. BMW employs about 18,000 staff in the UK, including the Mini plant at Cowley, the Rolls-Royce factory in Sussex and at other sites in Birmingham and Swindon. Unite assistant general secretary Tony Burke said the announcement was a ""big vote of confidence"" in BMW's UK workforce. He told the BBC that there had been ""patient discussions behind the scenes"" to secure the electric Mini. Although there was no news about extra jobs, Mr Burke said the new Mini would ""certainly underpin existing employment"". Cowley accounts for roughly two-thirds of global mini production The UK is still the biggest market for Minis - accounting for 20% of worldwide sales 4,500 people currently work at the Cowley plant Production of the electric car may result in the creation of a few specialised jobs, but no significant impact It is based on the existing three-door mini hatchback and will use the same production line - so investment is relatively small BMW currently makes electric motors and batteries for all of its electric cars at two factories in Germany, at Dingolfing and Landshut. Electric car development has been boosted by a series of announcements in recent months. The first phase of a Â£246m investment by the UK government into battery technology was launched on Monday. Earlier this month, Volvo became the first traditional car maker to commit toincluding an electric motorin all of its new models from 2019. US firm Tesla's first mass-market electric car, the Model 3, is expected to be unveiled on Friday at a handover party for 30 customers, before production is ramped up. And the first vehicle manufacturing facility to be built in Britain for more than a decade opened in Ansty, Coventry, in March to produce a new electric London black taxi.

"This video can not be played Donald Trump delivered a speech to remember to the Boy Scouts of America Parents have expressed anger after President Donald Trump delivered a highly politicised speech to tens of thousands of boy scouts. Mr Trump started by saying: ""Who the hell wants to speak about politics?"" But his speech to the Jamboree in West Virginia railed against Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton and the ""cesspool"" of politics, drawing whoops and cheers. One parent wrote: ""Done with scouts after you felt the need to have my kid listen to a liar stroke his ego."" The Jamboree of the Boy Scouts of America is held every four years and drew about 35,000 scouts from the ages of 12 to 18 to the latest event, held in Beaver, West Virginia, on Monday evening. This video can not be played What made Trump roll his eyes? The Jamboree had issued awarning on its blog,externalabout being respectful. It read: ""Chants of certain phrases heard during the campaign (e.g. 'build the wall', 'lock her up') are considered divisive by many members of our audience, and may cause unnecessary friction."" But in a rambling 35-minute speech, Mr Trump whipped up a response of boos, cheers, chants and jeers as he lambasted fake news, Hillary Clinton's election campaign and President Obama's failure to address a Jamboree in person. The whoops and hollers ran contrary to some parents' views of boy scout values Responding to the criticism of the speech, the Boy Scouts of America insisted it was ""wholly non-partisan and does not promote any one position, product, service, political candidate or philosophy"". It said the invitation to Mr Trump was a ""long-standing tradition and is in no way an endorsement of any political party or specific policies"". But theBoy Scouts of America Facebook page,externalcarried a number of angry posts. Jude Nevans Cleaver wrote: ""I am the proud mother of a former scout who was sheltered from that pack of lies speech at the Jamboree. Done with scouts after you felt the need to have my kid listen to a liar stroke his ego on our time."" Debbie S. Milligan said: ""Wow, this is what you are teaching the Boy Scouts? To be disrespectful to a Past President. One that had been a Boy Scout, unlike the current President. Completely disrespectful!"" On Instagram, Pete Souza, the former chief official White House photographer,posted a picture of President Barack Obama meeting a scout,external. ""I can assure you, POTUS [president of the United States] was not telling this Cub Scout and the Boy Scouts who followed about his electoral college victory,"" Mr Souza wrote. Many parents, lobbyists and politicians took to social media to cite the 107-year-old organisation's values, and to suggest Mr Trump had failed them. Lobbyist for women's and LGBT rightsAmy Siskind tweeted,external: ""If the Boy Scouts organization has any decency, they'll come out with a statement tonight denouncing Trump, and giving instructions for all troop leaders to speak to these boys about what they just heard and why it was wrong.""

The size of the crowd A familiar point of contention for the president, who was lambasted in the media over his estimation of the numbers at his inauguration address. ""Boy, you have a lot of people here. The press will say it's about 200 people. (Draws laughter.) It looks like about 45,000 people. You set a record today."" ""Fake media, fake media,"" he says, to boos and cheers. Boy Scout credentials Mr Trump says he has 10 ex-boy scouts in his cabinet and in the White House and turns on Barack Obama. ""By the way, just a question: did President Obama ever come to a Jamboree?"" Mr Trump asks. The audience shouts ""No!"". Mr Obama did address the Jamboree by video link in 2010. He was also a former boy scout, unlike Mr Trump. The election victory Mr Trump decries the electoral college system but goes through his victories, mentioning state after state to various cheers. He then says he worked hard in Michigan, adding ""my opponent didn't work hard there"" which draws boos from the audience. Obamacare and the veiled threat The audience of youngsters is introduced to former boy scout Tom Price, the health secretary. He tells Mr Price he had ""better get senators to vote"" when a showdown on healthcare comes up on Tuesday. Mr Trump says: ""He better get them. He better get them. Oh, he better - otherwise, I'll say 'Tom, you're fired!' I'll get somebody"". More applause. Obamacare v Republican plan compared 'Don't take away our healthcare' says Trump country The ""sewer"" ""You know, I go to Washington and I see all these politicians and I see the swamp and it's not a good place,"" says Mr Trump. ""In fact, today I said we ought to change it from the word 'swamp' to the word 'cesspool' or perhaps to the word 'sewer'."" Scout values Mr Trump says: ""As the scout law says, a scout is trustworthy, loyal. We could use some more loyalty, I will tell you that."" A nod, perhaps, to the James Comey affair. The sacked FBI chief claimed Mr Trump had demanded loyalty from him, something the president denies. Trump: Republicans haven't done their job.

"This video can not be played John McCain returned to the Senate to applause The US Senate has rejected a Republican plan to replace President Barack Obama's signature healthcare policy. The 57-43 vote defeat marks the start of a days-long debate on a sweeping overhaul that critics fear could deny healthcare to millions of Americans. The Better Care Reconciliation Act (BRCA) was crafted over two months but attention now turns to other options. President Donald Trump has urged senators to pass a bill, without indicating which one he supports. A repeal-only bill, which would consign so-called Obamacare to history in two years, to give time to Republicans to devise a replacement, could be debated and voted on next. But that measure - which non-partisan analysts say will take health insurance from more than 30 million people - has already failed to win enough support in the Republican party. Other attempts to replace Obamacare have collapsed in recent weeks due to divisions in the party. President Trump had made scrapping the policy a key campaign pledge. He says the system is ""torturing"" Americans. He secured a victory on Tuesday when the Senate agreed to allow the debate on health care legislation reform to go forward, but only after Republican Vice-President Mike Pence cast the tie-breaking vote in support of the bill. Obamacare v Republican plan compared 'Don't take away our healthcare' says Trump country Senator John McCain, who was recently diagnosed with an aggressive brain tumour, received a standing ovation as he returned to Congress to cast his ""Yes"" vote. President Trump tweeted,externalhis thanks to the Arizona senator for playing ""such a vital role"" in the vote. But in anearly morning tweet on Wednesday,external, Mr Trump lambasted Senator Lisa Murkowski of Alaska for opposing the Republican plan. The key repeal-and-replace bill, the BCRA, has fallen by the wayside. Next could be a repeal-only bill with a two-year delay, in the hope of finding agreement before that time elapses. But senators will also consider a ""skinny bill"", a far narrower measure that would scale back some of the more controversial elements in an effort to get a wider consensus. A special Senate-House of Representatives committee would then be tasked with finalising a bill that could still see changes during negotiations. If successful, the full House and Senate would again have to approve the measure. US Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price told CNBC on Wednesday that Senate Republicans should aim for the ""lowest common denominator"" to secure the 50 votes need to pass a bill. Republicans have long railed against Obamacare as government overreach, criticising the system for introducing government-run marketplaces, where premiums have risen sharply for some people. The party's proposed alternative includes steep cuts to Medicaid, a healthcare programme for the poor and disabled. Mitch McConnell said senators had ""a duty to act"" And it removes Obamacare's individual mandate requiring all Americans to have health insurance or pay a tax penalty. About 20 million people gained health insurance under former President Obama's Affordable Care Act. The non-partisan Congressional Budgetary Office (CBO) found the bill would strip 22 million Americans of health insurance over the next decade. If Republican senators elect to repeal key provisions of the law without immediately replacing it, the CBO estimates about 32 million consumers would lose insurance over the next 10 years.

"Ian Paterson was jailed for 15 years in May Disgraced breast surgeon Ian Paterson who carried out unnecessary cancer operations has been struck off. Paterson, 59, wassentenced in Mayto 15 years in jail for 17 counts of wounding with intent and three counts of unlawful wounding. Nottingham Crown Court heard he exaggerated or invented the risk of cancer in patients. A tribunal has now ruled his actions were ""serious, calculated, and sustained"" over a 14-year period. Paterson, of Altrincham, Greater Manchester, was sentenced on 31 May for procedures he carried out while working at at the privately-run Little Aston and Parkway hospitals in the West Midlands. He was not legally represented at the two-day disciplinary hearing in Manchester and had previously expressed the desire to be struck off without the need for a hearing. More updates on this story Delivering its ruling earlier, the panel said: ""The 10 patients who attended Mr Paterson were anxious about the physical symptoms they were experiencing. ""They put their trust in Mr Paterson to provide them with truthful medical advice, based on the results of assessments. ""The tribunal determined that Mr Paterson exploited this trust in order to carry out unnecessary procedures."" He showed a ""pattern of behaviour which involved deceit and violence, and resulted in life-long consequences for the patients involved"", the panel added. He was suspended by the GMC after his initial arrest. The NHS has paid almost Â£10m in compensation to his victims, while more than 600 private patients will pursue civil action against him later this year.

"Emily Hughes said she is ""appalled"" at the way Student Finance England functions A student has been unable to get a loan for university because someone with the same name, birthday and born in the same area has already applied for one. Emily Hughes, from Smethwick, West Midlands, was told by the Student Loans Company in April she could not be registered on its system. She has now sent them her passport in the hope of being recognised in time to study medicine in Birmingham. Miss Hughes, 18, said she was fed up with the way she had been treated. ""It's been chaos,"" she said. ""Just so much unnecessary stress and it's quite embarrassing as all my friends are sorted with their loans, but not me."" When she applied for a loan in April, Miss Hughes was told she could not get a customer reference number because there was someone with the same name registered on the system. Although her name is not that unusual, Miss Hughes said she was surprised to discover there was someone who was also born in Birmingham on the same date as her. ""I don't know anything about her,"" she said. ""I'd love to meet her, but at the same time I wouldn't."" Student Loans Company said once her passport arrives her application will be processed Miss Hughes finds out if she has got her place at the University of Birmingham on 17 August, depending on her A level grades, and then she would need to enrol in September and pay Â£9,250. ""I am now currently living with the fear of not having the means to finance my prospective degree. ""I am appalled with the way this organisation functions."" Student Loans Company said once her passport arrives her application will be processed. ""We apologise to Miss Hughes for any distress caused as a result of the delay in processing her student finance application. ""This was the result of a human error when transferring Miss Hughes' paper application to her online account."" One man, who asked not to be named, contacted the BBC to say he fell victim to the same situation when trying to help his son get a loan last year. ""I had to go on the website and put in my income details so that he could be means tested,"" he said. ""It wouldn't let me register on the website. I rang them up and apparently there was already an account in my name. Same name, including middle name, same date of birth and same place of birth. ""The only thing is I have never been to university and so never set up an account. It took many phone calls and a letter to prove who I was. Eventually it got put right but you do wonder.""

"Five adult and three infant Humboldt penguins died Eight penguins have been attacked and killed by an ""urban fox"" that broke into their water enclosure at Chessington World of Adventures. Assistant zoo manager Lisa Britton said it ""infiltrated"" their home at Penguin Bay during the night. Five adult and three infant Humboldt penguins died in the attack.  A ninth was injured but made a full recovery after treatment from a vet. The remaining 20 penguins have since been moved to a secure location. Ms Britton said staff at the zoo, which has only just released details of the June attack, were ""shocked and saddened"" by the loss. ""We are investigating why this happened, as Penguin Bay, only built in 2015, had special measures put in place specifically to deter foxes,"" she said. Penguin Bay has been closed while additional security measures are undertaken. A note on the adventure park's website reads: ""Our Humboldt penguins are currently enjoying their other home behind-the-scenes while we make alterations to Penguin Bay.""

"Connie Yates and Chris Gard's lawyer said Great Ormond Street Hospital was obstructing attempts to take Charlie home Moving Charlie Gard to a hospice to die would be the best option for the terminally-ill baby, a court has heard. The 11-month-old's parents had returned to the High Court to seek permission to take him home for ""a few days of tranquillity outside the hospital"". But Great Ormond Street Hospital (GOSH) said there were practical problems with that proposal, for example his ventilation equipment would not be able to fit through their front door. The judge will rule on Wednesday. At Tuesday's hearing, the judge said hospital managers had suggested a hospice would give Charlie and his parents the space, privacy and protection they needed. Chris Gard and Connie Yates have pleaded for a paediatric intensive care doctor to come forward to help their son die at home. ""We promised Charlie every day we would take him home. It seems really upsetting after everything we've been through to deny us this,"" Ms Yates said. Grant Armstrong, representing the parents, told Mr Justice Francis that his clients' ""last wish is that Charlie dies at home"". He suggested a portable ventilator and oxygen supply could be used but accused GOSH of ""putting up obstacles"". This video can not be played Chris Gard: ""We are so sorry we could not save you"" Lawyers for the hospital told the judge they ""would like to be able to fulfil the parents' wishes... if it is safe and practicable and in Charlie's best interests"". However, Katie Gollop QC, who leads the hospital's legal team, said providing intensive care for Charlie away from a hospital was not simple. Charlie's condition requires air to be forced into his lungs. She said as far as the hospital was aware invasive ventilation was only provided in a hospital setting. Ms Gollop said Charlie would need to be ""monitored by an ITU trained nurse at all times, with an ITU doctor on call and close at hand"". Such resources ""cannot be provided by GOSH to Charlie at his parents' home"", she said. Charlie has been in intensive care at Great Ormond Street Hospital since October Mr Justice Francis said: ""If going home can be achieved within reason then I would like to achieve that for them."" He said he would make a final decision, about whether Charlie can be taken home, at 14:00 BST on Wednesday. Charlie's parents, from Bedfont, west London, said they had been spending their ""last precious moments"" with their son. Charlie's medical case explained Death threats sent to Great Ormond Street Hospital staff Charlie has encephalomyopathic mitochondrial DNA depletion syndrome. He has brain damage and cannot move his arms or legs. His parents had asked Mr Justice Francis to rule that their son should be allowed to undergo a trial of nucleoside therapy in New York, a move opposed by medics at GOSH who argued the treatment would be ""futile"". The Family Division of the High Court heard on Monday that US neurologist Professor Michio Hirano was no longer willing to offer the experimental therapy after he had seen the results of a new MRI scan. In astatement to the High Court,external, GOSH said Professor Michio Hirano had not taken the opportunity to see Charlie until last week, despite being offered the chance to do so by the hospital in January. The hospital said it was also concerned the professor had declared a financial interest in some of the treatment he had proposed prescribing for Charlie. Timeline of legal battle 3 March 2017: Mr Justice Francis starts to analyse the case at a hearing in the Family Division of the High Court in London. 11 April: Mr Justice Francis says doctors can stop providing life-support treatment. 3 May: Charlie's parents ask Court of Appeal judges to consider the case. 23 May: Three Court of Appeal judges analyse the case. 25 May: Court of Appeal judges dismiss the couple's appeal. 8 June: Charlie's parents lose fight in the Supreme Court. 20 June: Judges in the European Court of Human Rights start to analyse the case after lawyers representing Charlie's parents make written submissions. 27 June: Judges in the European Court of Human Rights refuse to intervene. 3 July: The Pope and US President Donald Trump offer to intervene. 7 July: Great Ormond Street Hospital applies for a fresh hearing at the High Court. 24 July: Charlie's parents end their legal fight to take him to the US for treatment.

The UK's International Trade Secretary Liam Fox is currently in Washington discussing the potential for a UK-US trade deal after the UK's withdrawal from the EU in March 2019. No deal can be signed until after then. Mr Trump has said he would like to see a speedy deal although free trade agreements typically take many years to conclude and any agreement, which will have to be approved by Congress, is likely to involve hard negotiations over tariff and non tariff barriers in areas such as agriculture and automotive. Andrew Walker: Inside a US/UK trade deal NZ 'near front of UK trade deal queue' UK and EU still split on citizens' rights Warning over UK vet numbers after Brexit On Monday, Mr Fox published details of commercial ties between the UK and every congressional district in the US as a working party of officials met to discuss a future trade deal for the first time. Two-way trade between the two countries already totals Â£150bn. Mr Fox is also discussing other issues, including the continuation of existing trade and investment accords, with trade secretary Wilbur Ross and the US Trade Representative, Robert Lighthizer. At a breakfast meeting for members of the House of Representatives, Mr Fox said his twin objectives were to provide certainty for foreign investors ahead of Brexit and to expand the volume and value of trade with the US. ""The EU itself estimates that 90% of global growth in the next decade will come from outside Europe, and I believe as the head of an international economic department that this is an exciting opportunity for the UK to work even more closely with our largest single trading partner the US,"" he said. Sir Vince Cable, the new leader of the UK parliament's fourth largest party, the Liberal Democrats, said a US-UK trade deal could bring significant benefits - but he called on the government to guarantee parliament would get a vote on it first. ""Liam Fox and Boris Johnson must not be able to stitch up trade deals abroad and impose them on the country,"" he said. ""It is parliament, not Liam Fox, that should be the final arbiter on whether to sacrifice our standards to strike a deal with Trump.""

"Alice Cooper's manager said the singer's jaw dropped when told of the discovery US rock musician Alice Cooper has found a classic Andy Warhol artwork rolled up in storage after more than 40 years tucked away alongside tour equipment. The singer had forgotten about the work, entitled Little Electric Chair, presented as a gift in the 1970s. ""It was a rock 'n' roll time, none of us thought about anything,"" Cooper's long-time manager, Shep Gordon, said. A similar version of the Warhol artwork sold at Christie's in New York in 2014 for $10.5m (Â£8m). Cooper's find, a red silkscreen on canvas, was part of Warhol's Death and Disaster series and was discovered ""rolled up in a tube"" in a locker along with a collection of 1970s stage props, Mr Gordon toldBBC Radio 5 live. It was the decade that Cooper and Warhol met and became friends. ""It was all a swirl of drugs and drinking,"" said Mr Gordon, who has been the singer's manager for more than four decades. Cooper, real name Vincent Furnier, moved to New York with his late girlfriend Cindy Lang, where they were introduced to Warhol and spent time together in New York's famed Studio 54 nightclub, according to Mr Gordon. Ms Lang, who appeared on the second cover of Warhol's magazine Interview, later asked Mr Gordon to purchase the work on her behalf for about $2,500 as she planned to present it to Cooper as a birthday gift. ""He was a very heavy drinker in those days,"" Mr Gordon told the BBC, adding that Cooper's career was ""like a rocket ship taking off back in the early 70s - he was working 100 shows a year"". Mr Gordon said the rock singer was ""getting electrocuted"" at the time in his live shows using a prop electric chair that looked ""very much"" like the chair in the painting. He said that Cooper later entered rehab as a result of his drinking and ""never really moved into his apartment in New York"". The painting, he said, was forgotten. ""Nobody really ever thought about it, life went on,"" Mr Gordon said. In Pictures: Andy Warhol - Early Drawings Years later, Mr Gordon was having dinner with friends, one of whom happened to be an art dealer, when the conversation turned to a piece of work by Warhol that had sold for a large sum. ""So I got hold of Alice and I said: 'Do you still have that Warhol?' And he said: 'I don't think so'."" Mr Gordon said it was months before they tracked it down to the storage facility. ""And then we found a tube, like the type you keep posters in, and there it was - oops!"" He said that back in the early 1970s the artwork was not considered particularly valuable. ""Andy Warhol was not 'Andy Warhol' back then,"" he said. The artist died in 1987 at the age of 58. In aninterview with the Guardian,external, Mr Gordon said that Cooper had a vague recollection of discussing the artwork with Warhol. ""He thinks the conversation was real, but he couldn't put his hand on a Bible and say that it was,"" Mr Gordon said. The work has been confirmed as authentic by Warhol expert Richard Polsky. ""You should have seen Alice's face when Richard Polsky's estimate came in,"" Mr Gordon said, adding: ""His jaw dropped and he looked at me: 'Are you serious? I own that!'""

"More than 86,000 NHS posts were vacant between January 2017 and March 2017, figures for England suggest. Statistics fromNHS Digital,external, which collates data, shows the number of vacancies climbed by almost 8,000 compared to the same period in 2016. Nurses and midwives accounted for the highest proportion of shortages, with 11,400 vacant posts in March 2017. The Department of Health said staffing was a priority and that more money was being invested in frontline staff. The data includes job adverts published on the NHS Jobs website between February 2015 and March 2017. There are currently an estimated 1m full time jobs across the NHS in England. The latest figures suggest in March 2017 alone there were 30,613 full-time equivalent  vacancies advertised on the NHS Jobs website - the highest total for a month since this type of data was first collected in February 2015. And nursing and midwifery vacancies have topped the list since these figures have been collated. The data includes adverts for doctors, dentists, administrative, clerical staff and technical and scientific staff. The figures do not include vacancies for GPs or practice staff. But as other ways of advertising NHS jobs - including adverts seeking overseas applicants - exist, NHS officials say caution must be used when interpreting the results. Meanwhile, a Department of Health spokesperson said: ""We expect all parts of the NHS to make sure they have the right staff, in the right place, at the right time to provide safe care - which is why there are almost 32,400 more professionally qualified clinical staff including almost 11,800 more doctors, and over 12,500 more nurses on our wards since May 2010."" Janet Davies, general secretary of the Royal College of Nursing, said low pay and ""relentless pressure"" meant many nursing were leaving the profession. ""At the very moment the NHS needs to be recruiting more nursing staff, we learn the number is falling and the NHS finds itself advertising for more jobs we know it cannot fill,"" she said. ""A lethal cocktail of factors is resulting in too few nurses and patient care is suffering. ""More people are leaving nursing than joining - deterred by low pay, relentless pressure and new training costs. ""For the sake of patient safety, the Chancellor must scrap the cap on pay and help to fill the tens of thousands of vacant nurse jobs."" The RCN says nursing remains one of the lowest paid staff group of all public sector professions. According to its figures average starting salaries for nurses in London are around Â£26k and Â£22k elsewhere. The Department of Health says thousands more staff have joined the health service in the past seven years. And it says the seasonal way in which staff are recruited - with more joining between late summer and mid-winter - could account for some of the trends in the report. Meanwhile, NHS Improvement, which is responsible for overseeing NHS trusts, has a scheme in place to encourage more staff to stay within the health service and Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt has promised more medical student places in the future. But despite these moves, a number of organisations are concerned factors such as Brexit are denting the confidence of EU staff working in the NHS. The outgoing chief inspector of hospitalsin England, Prof Sir Mike Richards, told the BBC's Today Programme that Brexit posed a threat to recruitment which had to be addressed. And a recent report by theHealth Foundationfound that the number of EU nurses registering to work in England had dropped since the vote to leave the EU. The Department of Health has said EU staff play a ""valued"" role in the NHS and  are a priority in Brexit negotiations. But the Nursing and Midwifery Council points out that other issues - such as a recently introduced English language test - are also likely to have played a part. Meanwhile historiansargue NHS staff shortages have persisted since the very beginning of the NHS. They say the list of problems and solutions - including the number of training places for nurses and doctors and a reliance on overseas staff - is likely to be very long. Danny Mortimer, chief executive of NHS Employers, said employers were working ""especially hard"" to bring in more nurses. He added: ""We accept that retention is just as important as recruitment to keep vacancy levels low - that is why NHS Employers has been working with 92 NHS organisations to support their work to retain staff. ""Above all, we now need certainty for European economic area nationals in health and social care, and an immigration system that complements domestic efforts - this will help ensure we have the staff required to provide first class care in the 21st century."" Commenting on the report, Dr Mark Holland, of the Society for Acute Medicine, said extra pressure on ""overworked frontline staff"" to meet targets needed to be eased. He added:  ""This data shows it is high time we saw steps taken to stop disincentivizing staff - salaries must be fair, working conditions must be safe and sustainable and clear career pathways must be in place.""

"The Bank of England's financial stability director, Alex Brazier, has been warning about the dangers of rising personal loans. He said that High Street banks were at risk of entering ""a spiral of complacency"" about mounting consumer debt levels. ""Household debt - like most things that are good in moderation - can be dangerous in excess,"" he said. The Bank of England's own figures put total debt to individuals at about Â£1.5 trillion, which is an average of Â£28,000 for everyone over 16 in the UK. Most of that - about Â£1.3tn - is made up of mortgages. The rest is for credit cards, overdrafts and loans to buy things like cars, bikes or kitchens. If you look at what's been happening to lending to individuals, you can see from the chart above that it was rising sharply in the years leading up to the financial crisis, then it flattened out. But in the last couple of years it's started rising again. Mr Brazier talked about the risk to banks from the Â£200bn of non-mortgage debt, which has been growing much faster than household incomes. The credit-card element is Â£68bn, which is up 18% in the last three years. Of the remaining Â£130bn, the big growth area has beencar loans, with four-fifths of new cars last year bought using Personal Contract Purchase (PCP) deals, which tend to come from finance companies linked to car manufacturers. The Financial Conduct Authority is already concerned about the amount we're borrowing to buy cars. Can we afford all this? Household debt including mortgages as a proportion of household income rose from 95% in 1997 to 160% before the financial crisis. It then fell back to about 140% but has now started ticking back up. TheOffice for Budget Responsibility predicts,externalthat it will reach 153% in 2022. And all of these Bank of England statistics exclude student loans - currently about Â£89bn ofoutstanding student debt,external, which has more than doubled in the last five years.

"The US has some big healthcare businesses which would be keen to establish a stronger presence in the UK Relations with the United States were always going to be a high priority for British trade policy post-Brexit. So no surprise that Liam Fox has gone to Washington to discuss prospects. The International Trade Secretary is pushing for a bilateral trade liberalisation agreement with the US to take effect when the UK leaves the EU. And his American hosts seem well disposed to the idea in principle. Better access to the US market would go down well among many UK businesses too. It is, after allthe UK's largest single export market,external, though well behind the rest of the EU taken together. The US is also the second largest foreign supplier to the UK. So a freer trade relationship could reduce the cost of those imports. There was also a great deal of enthusiasm among British business for the EU's negotiations with the US, a project known as the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP). What is TTIP? Now that British business won't be able to make use of any benefits that might come from that exercise, if it is ever completed, a deal with the US would be helpful for many. Having said that, many regard it as a higher priority to preserve trade access to the EU as far as possible on existing terms. That is broadly the position of a number of British business lobbies. There are some areas of any UK/US talks that might be difficult.  Experience with the TTIP negotiations gives some clues as to the kind pressures the British government is likely to face at home. Genetically modified crops - like this maize - is an area for discussion One is resolving disputes under the agreement, particularly any involving foreign investors. Many trade and investment agreements provide for tribunals to be established if a foreign investor believes their interests have been harmed by the host government acting in a way that contravenes the agreement. They can seek financial compensation, and there are many cases where they have been successful. The system is known asinvestor state dispute settlement (ISDS). It has been around for decades, but has become more controversial in recent years. Critics see it as giving international businesses unfair leverage over the policies of elected governments. There will be business lobbies on both sides keen to see some sort of arrangement along these lines and campaigners vigorously opposed. There is a particular issue for some groups in the UK about how this might affect the National Health Service.  It came up in the context of the TTIP negotiations. The issue was partly whether the agreement might force the British government to privatise health service provision - and also about whether the agreement would make it hard or impossible to reverse any privatisation that did occur. The issue was that reversing such a move could deprive a foreign health company of business, which campaigners argued could enable it to use the ISDS tribunal system to seek compensation from the host (British) government. Chlorinated chicken is a familiar feature on US shelves but is banned in the EU The US has some big healthcare businesses which would be keen to establish a stronger presence in the UK.  How well founded that fear would be would depend on the wording of the agreement, but once detailed negotiations get underway it's likely to be brought up. In the context of TTIP, the idea that it would compromise public provision of healthcare was robustly rejected by, among others the British government, but campaigners did not accept that. Then there are food issues. Dr Fox has already responded to concerns about American chicken washed with chlorine. That came up in the TTIP talks too and it might well make an appearance again. The practice is widely used in the US to remove microbial contamination, but it is not permitted in the UK. Beef fed with growth promoting hormones, another practice used in the US, could also be difficult.  It's banned in the EU on the basis of health concerns. This is a trade dispute that has rumbled on for many years and the EU has lost the case in the World Trade Organization, which accepted that the hormones were safe. The EU has never complied with that ruling and still bans such meat. Another food issue is genetically modified crops. They do have a presence in the European food chain, partly through animal feed. But the approval process for new GM crops is seen by US farm groups as excessively slow and cumbersome. Movement on all three of these issues is likely to be important for US negotiators. The National Farmers' Union in the UK is receptive to the idea of reforming the GM approvals process, but the other two are more of a problem. Nonetheless there are certainly opportunities that businesses in both countries can see. For industry, the relatively straightforward area is tariffs, taxes on imported goods. They are relatively low in both the US and the UK (which currently adopts the EU's tariff policy). But there are some goods for which they are relatively high (10% for cars entering the UK from outside the EU, for example). Many industry and financial services groups would also welcome closer regulatory cooperation. It would simplify business for suppliers and could conceivably lower costs for customers. In any event, for now the UK remains a member of the EU and its common trade policy. But that certainly doesn't stop negotiators discussing what a post-Brexit deal would look like.

"What do Doctor Who, the Metropolitan Police and the UK Supreme Court all have in common? All three have recently appointed a woman in their leading role for the first time. Baroness Hale is the latest, continuing her trailblazing career by being named asthe president of the Supreme Courton Friday. She followed closely behind Jodie Whittaker's headline-grabbing casting asTV's first female Doctor,while Cressida Dick became thefirst woman to take charge of London's police forcein its 188-year history earlier this year. That trio have, between them, ended 250 years of male dominance. Yet there are plenty of renowned British institutions where a woman is still to reach the summit. Here are a selection: The man in the job Philip Hammond is the top dog at the Treasury - the latest in a long line of men. He was appointed in July 2016 as the government's chief financial minister. Along with prime minister, foreign secretary and home secretary, it's regarded as one of the four great offices of state, but while the others have all had female occupants, the wait for the first female chancellor goes on. The first chancellor listed by the government's website was Sir Richard Sackville in 1559. That's 458 years and counting... Any women contenders? Following the Brexit referendum, Andrea Leadsom was briefly one of the favourites to become the next chancellor. Yet she had set her sights on the biggest prize - becoming prime minister. But after losing out to Theresa May, she was then overlooked for the chancellor role. There were rumours Amber Rudd, the home secretary, waslined up for the role,externalthis year - but that was seemingly dependent on the Conservatives claiming a landslide victory in June's general election. A hung parliament put paid to that. Mrs May's weakened position meant Mr Hammond kept his grip on the job. The man in the job In February 2013 Justin Welby became the 105th Archbishop of Canterbury, the most senior cleric in the Church of England. It's a mere 1,420 years since St Augustine was the inaugural archbishop. Of course a woman - the Queen - holds the title of the supreme governor of the Church, but there has not yet been a woman who has taken up that archbishop role. Any women contenders? The last time this job was vacant, a female candidate wasn't a viable proposition. Women couldn't even be considered for bishop positions. That all changed in November 2014 when the Church of England voted to allow females into the role, following decades of wrangling over the issue. Two months later,Libby Lane was consecratedas its first woman bishop. Rachel Treweek went one step further as the Bishop of Gloucester, becoming the first female to bein charge of a diocese.and the first to sit in the House of Lords. By November 2015, eight women had been made bishops. The man in the job Tony Hall has been in the hotseat since March 2013, becoming the 16th permanent director general since the BBC's creation. Lord Reith, the corporation's founder, was the first - and the longest serving - beginning his 11-year tenure in 1927. Any women contenders? Not last time around - Lord Hall was approached directly for the role following the resignation ofGeorge Entwistleafter just 54 days in the job. The BBC Trust didn't speak to anyone else. Helen Boaden and Caroline Thomson were strong contenders to replace Mark Thompson in 2012, before Entwistle got the nod. Last year, Anne Bulford was namedLord Hall's second in command- the first woman to be deputy director general. For rivals Channel 4 a female leader is more imminent. Alex Mahon has been appointed as their firstfemale chief executiveand will take up the role in the autumn. The man in the job Canadian Mark Carney replaced Mervyn King as the head of the UK's central bank in June 2013, becoming the first foreigner to run the institution. In its 323-year history, there has never been a woman in charge, even though one appears on the front of all of the country's banknotes [yes, the Queen again]. Any women contenders? Mr Carney has led a drive to get more women in senior roles at the Bank. Charlotte Hogg landed the newly created role of chief operating officer in 2013 and was the most senior female employee in the institution's history. Earlier this year she was appointed deputy governor and was touted as a potential successor to Mr Carney - before hersudden resignationafter failing to disclose a potential conflict of interest. There has been a woman in charge of a major British bank - Ana Botin became the first female to hold that title when she became chief executive of Santander UK in December 2010. That led her to being named the third most powerful woman in Britain in 2013 by BBC Radio 4's Woman's Hour, just behind the Queen and Theresa May. The man in the job The newspaper's current editor, John Witherow, has been at the helm since January 2013. Founded in 1785, the Times is one of Britain's oldest and most influential newspapers around the world, and has had 21 different male editors. It all began with John Walter, whose family owned the paper for almost 125 years. Any women contenders? Emma Tucker could be in the frame when the position next becomes vacant. The former editor of Financial Times Weekend has been deputy editor at the Times since October 2013. And at sister paper, the Sunday Times, Sarah Baxter has been deputy editor for the last four years, Women have already made the breakthrough at other newspapers. The Guardian handed the reins to Katharine Viner in 2015 - the first female editor at the paper in 194 years, while Rebekah Brooks' groundbreaking spell in charge of the Sun lasted between 2003 and 2009. And Eve Pollard, the self-styled First Lady of Fleet Street, edited two papers - the Sunday Mirror from 1987 to 1991 and Sunday Express from 1991 to 1994. But one of the UK's first women editors, Mary Howarth, didn't exactly blaze a trail when she was appointed as editor of the Daily Mirror when it launched in 1903. No other woman has held that role since. The man in the job Jeremy Corbyn, one of the most unexpected winners of the party leadership in its history, was elected in September 2015. Founded by Keir Hardie in 1906, Labour has never been led by a woman other than for brief interim periods. Margaret Beckett and Harriet Harman have both been acting leader. Any women contenders? Ms Harman was deputy leader under both Gordon Brown and Ed Miliband, but didn't run for the main job. She has since admitted she should have stood in 2010. Women candidates have a history of doing badly in Labour leadership contests. Diane Abbott trailed in last in 2010 and the two female contenders in 2015, Liz Kendall and Yvette Cooper, came in last and second last. During last year's contest Angela Eagle dropped out before it had officially begun, leaving no women in the race. If Mr Corbyn was to leave his position any time soon, Ms Cooper is the favourite with some bookmakers. Angela Rayner, the youngest ever shadow education secretary, has also been spoken of as a future contender. The man in the job Speculation continues over whether Daniel Craig will return as James Bond, but as it stands, he is the man in the driving seat of the superspy's favoured Aston Martin. He first appeared as 007 in 2006, succeeding the likes of Sean Connery, Roger Moore and Pierce Brosnan in one of the most sought-after roles in British cinema. Any women contenders? Gillian Anderson, of X-Files fame, has put her hat in the ring to be the next 007. Last year she tweeted, alongside a mocked-up poster of herself in the role, ""It's Bond, Jane Bond"". Charlize Theron, who plays a British spy in her upcoming film Atomic Blonde, has been endorsed by fellow actor Chris Hemsworth as a future Bond. Bookmakers certainly aren't writing off the possibility. ""Any female"" is currently joint-seventh favourite with Ladbrokes and Coral - the same odds as Michael Fassbender.

"Volunteers have located and photographed hundreds of WW1 grave markers brought back from the front, like this one at Garboldisham, Norfolk Manicured lawns and gleaming white headstones now welcome visitors to the World War One cemeteries of France and Belgium. But a century ago, these soldiers' graves were marked with simple wooden crosses. What happened to them and who are the people tracking them down? On the wall of St Anne's Church in Sale, Greater Manchester, hangs one such cross. Made from two pieces of wood nailed together, with a sharp, earth-stained point, it has a metal strip reading: ""UNKNOWN BRITISH SOLDIER"". It was one of hundreds of thousands of markers indicating the graves of Commonwealth soldiers all along the Western Front. Some are cracked and water-damaged. Many have woodworm. Some even have the original Somme mud varnished on to them. Others are ornate, hand-carved and painted, made in the field by comrades, often from scrap wood or old packing crates, and bearing personal inscriptions. Aviators' graves were often marked by propellers. This cross at St Anne's Church, Sale, is one of hundreds being catalogued by the Returned from the Front project Heritage specialist Nick Stone and a band of dedicated volunteers are tracking down the repatriated grave markers to photograph and catalogue them and create an ever-growing online map and database. Nick, of Norwich, jokes that when the Returned from the Front project began in July 2016, he thought ""it would all be over by Christmas"" - just as people reputedly said about the war itself. Visitors to WW1 cemeteries, like this one at Ypres, will be familiar with the uniform Portland stone headstones During the war, graves were usually marked with simple wooden crosses During the war, soldiers were typically buried where they fell or close by. The sheer volume of casualties, and the fact that units were still sometimes under fire, meant this was often done hastily. Graves were marked for later identification, sometimes by sticks or rifles pushed into the ground, or by wooden crosses. Such was the scale of the killing that crosses were mass-produced and shipped to the front. Maj John Burgh Talbot Leighton MC, Scots Guards, Royal Flying Corps, is commemorated by a propeller cross at St Michael and All Angels Church at Alberbury, Shropshire Later, under the authority of the Imperial War Graves Commission - now the Commonwealth War Graves Commission (CWGC) - these bodies were exhumed and reburied in larger cemeteries, marked with the now-familiar uniform Portland stone gravestones. The now-redundant wooden markers were then offered to the dead men's families, with each responsible for either collecting them or shipping them home. According to CWGC records, at least 10,000 were returned to next of kin. Some were given to churches or other organisations, but most of the unclaimed markers were destroyed. Often they were burnt and the ashes scattered across the burial grounds. Nick Stone, the man behind the Returned from the Front project, has been fascinated by WW1 since he was a boy Trips to WW1 battlefields and cemeteries, including Bernafey Wood on the Somme, helped inspire Nick's project Of the crosses that survive today, most are in churches but others are in museums, memorial halls, private collections and even schools. Nick's interest came through a lifelong fascination with World War One. His birthday is on Armistice Day, when his mother would often take out a tin containing her late father's medals, a few lace postcards and his ""Dead Man's Penny"" commemorative plaque. ""Handling this huge penny with my grandfather's name, Percy James Parr, on it left an indelible mark. I've chased who he was ever since,"" he says. Nick's grandfather was 37 when he was killed at Messines Ridge on 7 June 1917. But there is no marker for him. As Nick writes onhis blog,external, he ""did actually vanish, totally, no evidence, no meat or bone, nothing to sew in a blanket and bury in a cemetery"". He is, however, commemorated on the Menin Gate in Ypres, along with the other men in his company who died in the same attack - all of them missing. Nick's grandfather, Percy James Parr, pictured with his wife Jesse, daughter Grace (Nick's mother) and son Tom, was killed in 1917, aged 37 Nick's grandfather is commemorated on the Menin Gate at Ypres Nick's idea for Returned from the Front came through ""thinking out loud on Twitter"", and he harnessed social media to recruit volunteers to survey, catalogue and photograph the grave markers. ""The volunteers are great. They are from all walks of life. The youngest is four - she went with her dad - and the adults are from 18 up to 80. Everybody's been pretty marvellous, really,"" he says. Maj George F Molineux-Montgomerie, killed at the Hohenzollern Redoubt in northern France on 22 October 1915, is commemorated by a cross at Garboldisham, Norfolk So far, about 70 volunteers have sent in photographs and surveys, with many more providing other helpful information. Margaret Draycott, a phlebotomist from Liverpool, and colleague Bev Goodwin have catalogued 85 markers, mainly around the north-west of England, but as far away as north Wales, Shropshire and Sussex. When not visiting the grave marker sites, Margaret is often conducting internet research. ""If my family want to find me, they know I'm 'crossing',"" she says. Colleagues Bev Goodwin (left) and Margaret Draycott, pictured on a battlefield tour in Belgium, have catalogued 85 markers between them Lt Col Philip Vaughan Holberton, who was mentioned in despatches five times, is remembered at St Mary's Church, Bitterley, Shropshire Another of the more ornate crosses is at the Army Training Centre in Pirbright, Surrey, and commemorates members of the Grenadier Guards Some churches are not aware of the significance of the markers, or even what they are. ""People have engaged with us and are absolutely blown away that what they have are from soldiers' graves,"" says Margaret. Among the markers she has photographed is that of Ellis Humphrey Evans, better known as Hedd Wyn, the Welsh poet killed on the first day of the Battle of Passchendaele on 31 July 1917. A cross for Ellis Humphrey Evans, better known as Welsh poet Hedd Wyn, is on display at the Llys Ednowain Heritage Centre at Trawsfynydd, Gwynedd, north Wales Hedd Wyn, who was 30 when he died, wrote his famous poem Yr Arwr (The Hero) before leaving for the front One unusual marker is a wooden Star of David, at Broadgreen Cemetery, Liverpool, commemorating an unknown Jewish soldier. Often it was impossible to identify an individual soldier's remains, and Merseyside has a particular concentration of markers for so-called ""unknowns"", probably brought back during pilgrimages by churches and other groups. Although most markers were crosses, Jewish soldiers' graves were sometimes indicated by a Star of David Capt WHM Kersey, who was killed near Ypres on 17 October 1917, is commemorated by a cross at St John the Baptist Church, Felixstowe, Suffolk Capt Kersey's cross was originally at The Huts Cemetery, Dikkebus, Belgium After the war, crosses at The Huts Cemetery were replaced by Portland stone headstones Ministry of Defence colleagues Samantha Fryer, from Swindon, and Dr Alison Wilken, from Lambourn, Berkshire, have surveyed markers in Oxfordshire, Wiltshire, Berkshire and Gloucestershire. ""It's quite nice to know that you are part of a project that's being published that schools and researchers might find useful in the future,"" says Samantha. Samantha Fryer is often accompanied by Arthur the terrier on her visits Gnr Harry Varney is commemorated by a cross featuring an inscription scratched on a piece of tin St Mary the Virgin Church at Wootton, Oxfordshire, has eight crosses, including one for Gnr Harry Varney, killed in September 1917, aged 30. It bears an inscription scratched on a piece of metal, possibly from a tobacco or pilchard tin. ""To see somebody's writing like that was quite poignant,"" says Samantha. ""There is an enormous contrast between a lowly gunner's cross with a piece of tin tacked to it and the impressive carved and painted crosses of the officers."" Returned from the Front builds on work by Imperial War Museums (IWM). ""It's an absolutely first-class project, worthy of our fullest support,"" says Ian Hook, who runs IWM's War Memorials Register of more than 68,000 memorials, including 610 battlefield markers. Only recently, he says, has their significance has been properly appreciated. Many were lost, possibly thrown away by ""trendy vicars"", who felt that their presence was a tacit endorsement of war, he says. The organisation that became the Commonwealth War Graves Commission was set up by Sir Fabian Ware Many crosses would not even have made it back to Britain at all. ""They were offered back to families, but many soldiers were just working lads and the families had lost their breadwinner,"" he explains. ""Given the opportunity to acquire a cross or buy food or shoes for the kids, what were they going to do?"" Others were lost or destroyed as the fighting shifted and the makeshift cemeteries became battlefields once more. The fact that any markers found their way home is testament to the work of the CWCG, whose founder Sir Fabian Ware was determined to ensure the resting places of the war dead would not be lost. ""It's important to preserve these relics of the war,"" says the organisation's chief historian Glyn Prysor. ""They're physical objects brought all the way back from the battlefield and they can help us to connect with that in a tangible way."" Nearly 12,000 Commonwealth servicemen are buried at Tyne Cot Commonwealth War Graves Commission cemetery in Passchendaele, Belgium ""The body may be far away in a cemetery but the marker may be in a local church or somewhere else significant. It's making that link between the local area and a global conflict. It's a very special thing."" For now, the work of Nick and his volunteers continues. They hope it will help the markers survive even longer. Although the many events that have been held to commemorate the war's centenary will conclude next year, Nick says: ""I think it's important we don't stop remembering after 11 November 2018.""

"For six years, theUnited Nations Commission of Inquiry on Syria,externalhas been painstakingly gathering information about possible war crimes and crimes against humanity committed during the conflict. The investigators have produced 13 reports, the evidence in each is harrowing. Villages destroyed, crops burnt, wells poisoned, torture, rape, starvation sieges, mass bombing of civilians, and what only a decade ago might have been unthinkable - chemical weapons. There is no doubt that war crimes have been committed by all sides, the commission says. In each report there is a demand for ""accountability"" - that no-one should be allowed to commit such horrific acts and get away with it. ""This would be incredible, a scandal,"" says commission member Carla Del Ponte, who describes the violations in Syria as by far the worst she has ever come across. ""But nothing happens, only words, words, and more words."" Ms Del Ponte, as a former prosecutor at the tribunal for Yugoslavia, and the woman who put Slobodan Milosevic in the dock, knows how to bring war criminals to book. Carla Del Ponte says the violations of international law in the Syrian conflict are the worst she has encountered While the Syria commission has no power to prosecute, what it does have is a vast amount of evidence, and a confidential list of names, thought to include figures at the very top of the Syrian government and military. To bring those individuals (including, Ms Del Ponte thinks, President Assad) to court, the UN Security Council would have to refer Syria to the International Criminal Court. And throughout the Syria conflict, the Security Council has been divided, with Russia and China in particular resisting what they regard as unnecessary interference in Syria's problems. Now, though, the United Nations, under new Secretary General Antonio Guterres, appears to be flexing its muscles. A new body has been set up, called, rather dryly, the International, Impartial and Independent Mechanism or IIIM, to sift the evidence, build cases, and pass them to any court that could have jurisdiction. Some European countries are already opening cases. Syria conflict: All parties committed war crimes in Aleppo - UN What is a war crime?,external Austria convicts asylum seeker of Syria war crimes New court to try suspects of war crimes committed in Kosovo At its head is an experienced French judge, Catherine Marchi-Uhel, who has worked on the tribunal for former Yugoslavia, and the Extraordinary Courts of Cambodia, which prosecuted the Khmer Rouge. ""This gives me hope that something is moving,"" says Alain Werner, director ofCivitas Maxima,external, a Swiss organisation that works to ensure justice for victims of war crimes and crimes against humanity. ""I didn't even think this body would be set upâ¦ this is proof [the UN] is serious."" Mr Werner's own organisation has already built cases against suspected war criminals from Sierra Leone and Liberia, and his work with victims has shown him, he says, that ""the eagerness for justice is immense"". One of his colleagues, Antonya Tioulong, knows personally just how important this can be. Her sister and brother-in-law were tortured and murdered in Phnom Penh's notorious S-21 detention centre during the reign of the Khmer Rouge in Cambodia. In 1995, Srebrenica was the scene of the worst massacre of the Bosnian war In the 1990s, almost two decades after her sister's death, Antonya was able to learn what had happened to her, and she tried to bring a case in the French courts against the Khmer Rouge officers who had run S-21. It was rejected. ""I felt powerless. There was no sign, either, of an international tribunal. I wondered, 'Were the two million victims of the Khmer Rouge genocide so unimportant in the eyes of the world that the criminals did not need to be judged?'"" Antonya had to wait until 2008, when an international tribunal was finally set up. The men who murdered her sister were at last convicted. She was comforted not just by the verdict, but by the fact that the tribunal was public. ""Thousands of people came from all over the world to attend the hearings in person, showing their desire to understand what happened."" But many thousands of victims still wait. In the Swiss capital, Berne, theRed Cross Centre for Victims of Torture and War,externalhad more than 4,000 consultations in 2016 alone. ""Almost the most important thing is that they have the space and time to talk,"" says psychologist Carola Smolenski. ""We have patients from former Yugoslavia who still suffer chronically from their experiences."" For many of these patients, however, there may never be a public tribunal where perpetrators are convicted, and the suffering of their victims formally recognised in a court of law. Instead, the Red Cross Centre has included a form of ""validation"" process as part of the therapy. Many Syrians, millions of whom are in refugee camps, still await news of loved ones ""We will prepare [together with the patient] a detailed chronological report,"" says Carola Smolenski. ""We recognise the experience together, and we sign it as witnesses."" ""It is important that they can say, 'That is my story, and it is being taken seriously.'"" For the millions of Syrians waiting in refugee camps, or trapped in besieged cities, peace cannot come soon enough. But millions of Syrians, too, are waiting to know the fate of loved ones who disappeared into Syria's prisons, or vanished in the heat of battle. In Geneva, the UN peace process is inching along. In the talks about Syria in the Kazakh capital, Astana, the Russians, Turks, and Iranians are working to negotiate ""de-escalation zones"" to reduce the violence. But in neither the Geneva process nor Astana is there much talk of accountability for the undoubtedly massive number of war crimes and crimes against humanity. It is unclear whether the newly formed IIIM has a role in the peace process at all. Could this be because leaders, on all sides of Syria's conflict, might not be motivated to reach a peace deal if they thought a war crimes trial would be their reward? ""You might have put your finger on it,"" says one Western diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity. The idea that achieving peace, or at least an absence of war, should take priority over justice is often advanced during tricky diplomatic negotiations. Some also suggest that war crimes tribunals can sow the seeds of future discord, particularly if victims are from one ethnic group and perpetrators from another. The Nuremburg war trials resulted in many convictions but little remorse, says UN human rights commissioner Zeid Ra'ad al Hussein Archbishop Emeritus of Cape Town the Most Reverend Desmond Tutu famously did not want a tribunal for South Africa, pushing instead for a truth and reconciliation process, in which the accused would acknowledge their crimes but also be forgiven by their victims. The UN's human rights commissioner, Zeid Ra'ad al Hussein, agrees that creating sustainable peace is a complex process, but insists that the authors of Syria's suffering must be formally prosecuted. ""In Syria, there will never be peace if you don't put the victims at the centre of your effort,"" he says. ""You can have the most finely crafted agreement, but if victims don't feel justice, then it is worthless, a pointless exercise. There has to be an accounting, the central authors must be brought to book."" Nevertheless, he sees prosecutions as only part of the process. ""At a fundamental level, we will never have permanent peace if we don't deal with unresolved issues."" This means, he says, all sides in a conflict recognising their conduct, and showing ""contrition"". And there, Mr Hussein says, society must play its role. During the German trials after World War Two, he points out, there were 7,000 convictions, but few of those convicted showed any remorse. The push for contrition and remorse came later, through work by German historians, school teachers, and post-War politicians. Alain Werner agrees that, in view of the scale of the atrocities in Syria, ""it is very difficult to think there will be no justice"". But, he adds, because the number of cases is ""staggering"", justice is unlikely to be swift. ""Syria could take 40 yearsâ¦ even 100 years to investigate.""

"When ministers pledged to double the amount of free childcare for working parents, they never dreamed it could lead to some top nurseries closing. But just over two years on, that is exactly what is about to happen. Fidgety Fingers in Essex, one of many nurseries which says it cannot make government funding rates stretch over 30 hours, will shut on Wednesday. The government says it has boosted the rates it pays councils to fund the scheme, including Essex County Council. The Department for Education is sure that the 30 hours scheme, which is due to start in September, will be a success, like it says its trial scheme has been. But the popular pre-school, which has been repeatedly rated outstanding by Ofsted, has only just broken even over the last few years like many nurseries and pre-schools. The children make full use of its expansive garden, driving around in a make-believe bus, shaded from the sun by the maternal arms of a beautiful apple tree. Based on the same site as owner Jackie Neagle's home, it has a familial feel, with all the children calling the nursery staff ""auntie"". The children will soon be off to pastures new ""I've never had a parent look at the nursery who hasn't asked for a place,"" she says. Fidgety Fingers caters for pre-school children, with all of those aged three and four being entitled to 15 hours free childcare a week. But from September, those from families with working parents will be entitled to 30 hours free care/early years education per week - just so long as their parents do not earn more than Â£100,000 a year each. Like many other nurseries, the rate Jackie receives from the government via Essex County Council for the 15 free hours does not cover her staff costs or overheads. When she opened 10 years ago, the money just about worked, she said, but as the bills and overheads have increased it no longer stretches that far. And in recent months the rate the nursery is paid has been reduced to Â£4.21 an hour from a high of Â£4.61 several years ago. ""Currently we make a loss of Â£1.95 an hour per child, so we ask for voluntary contributions of Â£30 per week per child,"" she says. Although parents always say they are willing to pay that, she says, they may only be able to do so for a little while. ""Life happens. You can't run a business on voluntary contributions."" But as nurseries are not allowed to charge any top-up fees - the free hours are advertised as free and must be at the point of use - that's exactly what she is having to do. Many nurseries make up the shortfall by charging much higher rates for the additional hours, above cost for extras such as lunch or nappies, or by forcing parents to start at a certain time or take their hours in a certain way, she says. ""I am not prepared to charge Â£45 for an additional hour. I wouldn't be able to sleep at night. ""I am an honest person. I don't want to run a business dishonestly, to rip people off, but I do need to make a living."" Fidgety Fingers has been offering additional hours, but these are charged at Â£6.50 per hour. But when the number of free hours is doubled, the nursery will not be able to charge for additional hours, unless it dramatically increases its opening hours and, as a small set-up with only a small number of staff, that will not be possible. So after three decades of working with children, Jackie has reached the point where she feels unable to continue. Her families have of course been shocked and disappointed, says Jackie. One mother, Jordana Mould, whose third and youngest child, Rufus, is at the nursery, said: ""Nothing will compare to Fidgety Fingers. It has become more than just a nursery for my family. All three of Jordana's children have attended Fidgety Fingers ""However, I completely understand why Jackie has to close the doors. ""How can she run Fidgety Fingers on voluntary payments from parents every month?"" Ironically, Jackie says she started thinking about closing the nursery when it received its fourth outstanding rating by Ofsted. ""I realised I am not going to be able to reward my fantastic staff with a pay rise."" Despite the low pay of staff, children who have attended the nursery go into Reception a year ahead of their classmates on average, says Jackie. Essex County Council said it had been working with local providers on their decisions on whether to offer the extended hours. And it pledged to support any local families affected by the closure of this nursery. The government says it has boosted funding rates in Essex for next year from Â£3.89 to Â£4.47 per hour. The council is entitled to use a proportion of that money for its administration costs and like all local authorities has had to make huge budget savings in recent years. Childcare minister Robert Goodwill said the extra free hours were funded nationally by a Â£1bn boost to raise rates paid to local providers. He added that the rates were  based on a comprehensive review of childcare costs and took account of current and future pressures. But for the staff of Fidgety Fingers, that's not how it feels on the ground. Jackie says: ""The Early Years sector is very good at trying to patch up and make do... but for as long as we all try to do that, the more the government doesn't have to do anything. ""It's great for parents, but my staff who are earning an average of Â£8.50 an hour are subsidising parents who are earning up to Â£200,000 a year. ""And when you think about that, it just brings it all home.""

"Alex Malcolm's mother described him as ""a beautiful little angel"" A man who battered his girlfriend's five-year-old son to death in a London park for losing a trainer has been jailed for life. Marvyn Iheanacho, 39, attacked Alex Malcolm in Mountsfield Park, Catford, on 20 November 2016. Witnesses heard a ""child's fearful voice saying 'sorry'"", loud banging and a man screaming about the loss of a shoe, Woolwich Crown Court was told. Iheanacho, who denied murder, will serve a minimum of 18 years in prison. Marvyn Iheanacho was found guilty of murder on Friday The jury heard Alex suffered head and stomach injuries and died in hospital two days after the beating. His mother, Lilya Breha, 30, told the court Iheanacho had also attacked her after she tried to call an ambulance when he returned to her flat carrying her injured son. In a tearful interview, she said: ""He (Alex) was bubbly. He was just perfect you know, he was a really, really special little boy. ""He was shy, he was so shy, and very polite. He would always say 'Mummy thank you' and 'I love you Mummy'."" Alex's mother Lilya Breha said Iheanacho hid his temper 'pretty well' Ms Breha described Iheanacho as a ""good liar"" and pathetic. Recalling how she met him through a friend after he left prison, she said he had convinced her he was innocent and a good person. She said: ""When I think about it now, to be honest I feel like it was all such a big lie and he just pretended to be a good guy pretty well."" Prosecutors revealed there had been ""problems with witness interference"" during the trial, with Iheanacho phoning Ms Breha from prison to try to persuade her to back him in court. Witnesses in the park heard a man screaming about the loss of a shoe In a victim impact statement, Alex's father said he would ""never forget seeing him in his hospital bed fighting for his life. That image will stay with me forever."" ""Just thinking about what's happened and trying to put words on paper is tearing me apart,"" he said. One of Alex's trainers was later found in the play area by police Sentencing, Judge Mark Dennis QC said the killer had a deeply entrenched character flaw that ""leads you to overreact and lose your temper"". ""You used your undoubted strength and simple brute force,"" against a ""completely defenceless"" child, he said. He said Iheanacho, who has a string of previous convictions for violent offences, had given fake and misleading accounts to paramedics, hospital staff and police.

"Five adult and three infant Humboldt penguins died Eight penguins have been attacked and killed by an ""urban fox"" that broke into their water enclosure at Chessington World of Adventures. Assistant zoo manager Lisa Britton said it ""infiltrated"" their home at Penguin Bay during the night. Five adult and three infant Humboldt penguins died in the attack.  A ninth was injured but made a full recovery after treatment from a vet. The remaining 20 penguins have since been moved to a secure location. Ms Britton said staff at the zoo, which has only just released details of the June attack, were ""shocked and saddened"" by the loss. ""We are investigating why this happened, as Penguin Bay, only built in 2015, had special measures put in place specifically to deter foxes,"" she said. Penguin Bay has been closed while additional security measures are undertaken. A note on the adventure park's website reads: ""Our Humboldt penguins are currently enjoying their other home behind-the-scenes while we make alterations to Penguin Bay.""

"Connie Yates and Chris Gard's lawyer said Great Ormond Street Hospital was obstructing attempts to take Charlie home Moving Charlie Gard to a hospice to die would be the best option for the terminally-ill baby, a court has heard. The 11-month-old's parents had returned to the High Court to seek permission to take him home for ""a few days of tranquillity outside the hospital"". But Great Ormond Street Hospital (GOSH) said there were practical problems with that proposal, for example his ventilation equipment would not be able to fit through their front door. The judge will rule on Wednesday. At Tuesday's hearing, the judge said hospital managers had suggested a hospice would give Charlie and his parents the space, privacy and protection they needed. Chris Gard and Connie Yates have pleaded for a paediatric intensive care doctor to come forward to help their son die at home. ""We promised Charlie every day we would take him home. It seems really upsetting after everything we've been through to deny us this,"" Ms Yates said. Grant Armstrong, representing the parents, told Mr Justice Francis that his clients' ""last wish is that Charlie dies at home"". He suggested a portable ventilator and oxygen supply could be used but accused GOSH of ""putting up obstacles"". This video can not be played Chris Gard: ""We are so sorry we could not save you"" Lawyers for the hospital told the judge they ""would like to be able to fulfil the parents' wishes... if it is safe and practicable and in Charlie's best interests"". However, Katie Gollop QC, who leads the hospital's legal team, said providing intensive care for Charlie away from a hospital was not simple. Charlie's condition requires air to be forced into his lungs. She said as far as the hospital was aware invasive ventilation was only provided in a hospital setting. Ms Gollop said Charlie would need to be ""monitored by an ITU trained nurse at all times, with an ITU doctor on call and close at hand"". Such resources ""cannot be provided by GOSH to Charlie at his parents' home"", she said. Charlie has been in intensive care at Great Ormond Street Hospital since October Mr Justice Francis said: ""If going home can be achieved within reason then I would like to achieve that for them."" He said he would make a final decision, about whether Charlie can be taken home, at 14:00 BST on Wednesday. Charlie's parents, from Bedfont, west London, said they had been spending their ""last precious moments"" with their son. Charlie's medical case explained Death threats sent to Great Ormond Street Hospital staff Charlie has encephalomyopathic mitochondrial DNA depletion syndrome. He has brain damage and cannot move his arms or legs. His parents had asked Mr Justice Francis to rule that their son should be allowed to undergo a trial of nucleoside therapy in New York, a move opposed by medics at GOSH who argued the treatment would be ""futile"". The Family Division of the High Court heard on Monday that US neurologist Professor Michio Hirano was no longer willing to offer the experimental therapy after he had seen the results of a new MRI scan. In astatement to the High Court,external, GOSH said Professor Michio Hirano had not taken the opportunity to see Charlie until last week, despite being offered the chance to do so by the hospital in January. The hospital said it was also concerned the professor had declared a financial interest in some of the treatment he had proposed prescribing for Charlie.

Homeless people who keep possessions in doorways in Oxford have been warned they face fines of up to Â£2,500.

""Most of the stuff which was taken was stuff that the public donated... it's a shame,"" he said, adding he now carries his possessions around in a trolley. Oxford City Council said those issued with notices had two days to collect their belongings, and everything was taken by the owners except ""a soiled duvet and pieces of cardboard"" which were removed. Neo said he has been forced to carry his belongings around on a trolley The local authority also said homeless people who engage with aid services could access lockers to store their belongings.

"This video can not be played Chris Gard: ""We are so sorry we could not save you"" Charlie Gard's parents are spending their ""last precious moments"" with their terminally ill son after ending their legal fight to take him to the US for treatment. Chris Gard and Connie Yates want to spend the ""maximum amount of time they have left with Charlie"". The couple ended the case after a US doctor told them it was now too late to treat Charlie's rare genetic condition. Lawyers for the couple are due back in court on Tuesday afternoon. Great Ormond Street Hospital (GOSH) has not said when life support will end. However, Mr Gard and Ms Yates, from Bedfont, west London, said Charlie would not reach his first birthday on 4 August. Charlie has a rare genetic condition and would not live to see his first birthday, his father said In its statement to the High Court,external, the hospital said it was ""increasingly surprised and disappointed"" the US doctor, Professor Michio Hirano, ""had not read Charlie's contemporaneous medical records or viewed Charlie's brain imaging or read all of the second opinions about Charlie's condition"". GOSH said Professor Hirano had not taken the opportunity to see Charlie until last week, despite being offered the chance to do so by the hospital in January. Even though the professor gave written evidence at all the court cases, the hospital said it only emerged last week that he had not read the judge's ruling following the first High Court hearing in April. The hospital added it was concerned to hear the professor state in the witness box at the High Court hearing on 13 July that he had a financial interest in some of the treatment he proposed prescribing for Charlie. Charlie has encephalomyopathic mitochondrial DNA depletion syndrome. He has brain damage and cannot move his arms or legs. His parents had asked Mr Justice Francis to rule that their son should be allowed to undergo a trial of nucleoside therapy in New York, a move opposed by London's Great Ormond Street Hospital, which argued it would be ""futile"".

Charlie Gard's medical case explained,external Charlie Gard parents end legal fight Speaking outside court, Mr Gard said: ""We are now going to spend our last precious moments with our son Charlie, who unfortunately won't make his first birthday in just under two weeks' time. ""Mummy and Daddy love you so much Charlie, we always have and we always will and we are so sorry that we couldn't save you."" Mr Justice Francis said he hoped lessons could be learned from the ""tragic"" case. He has suggested that parents and hospital bosses who disagree over life-or-death treatment for children should be forced to mediate in a bid to avoid litigation. ""I recognise, of course, that negotiating issues such as the life or death of a child seems impossible and often will be,"" he said. ""However, it is my clear view that mediation should be attempted in all cases such as this one, even if all that it does is achieve a greater understanding by the parties of each other's positions."" Charlie has been in intensive care at Great Ormond Street Hospital since October Mr Gard's and Ms Yates's five-month legal battle started after doctors at Great Ormond Street had said the therapy would not help and that life-support treatment should stop. They subsequently failed to overturn rulings in the High Court, Court of Appeal and Supreme Court in London, and also failed to persuade judges at the European Court of Human Rights to intervene. The couple made the ""most painful of decisions"" on Monday after reviewing new scan results which showed Charlie had deteriorated to the ""point of no return"". In a statement, Great Ormond Street said: ""The agony, desolation and bravery of their decision command GOSH's utmost respect and humble all who work there."" Mr Gard and Ms Yates hope toestablish a foundationto ensure Charlie's voice ""continues to be heard"". They had raised more than Â£1.3m for the treatment in the US.

"This video can not be played Vlogger Dodie tells BBC Radio 5 live she is raising awareness of mental health issues by filming her treatment Depersonalisation disorder, sometimes known as DPD, leaves sufferers feeling like they're not part of the world they live in. ""I feel spaced out a lot of the time. I feel like I'm not really here, like I'm living in a dream,"" says Dodie Clark, a 22-year-old musician and vlogger from London. ""I can't open my eyes wide enough or see things properly."" The mental health disorder can lead to severe depression as emotions, empathy and wellbeing give way to a detachment and distance from daily life. Dodie says: ""It's caused me to have depression and anxiety. I noticed suicidal thoughts creeping in and that was definitely the point where I thought I need some help."" What causes the condition is not yet understood - and treatments such as medication and counselling aren't always effective. Dodie has suffered from depersonalisation for about two years, and is now trying out a fairly new treatment called trans-cranial magnetic stimulation. Known as TMS, it is currently available in only two NHS trusts and a handful of private clinics. It is a mainstream treatment in the US, but not the UK. Dodie allowed BBC Radio 5 Live to accompany her for a treatment at the Smart TMS clinic in Chelsea. At first sight, the therapy looks similar to electro-convulsive therapy, a controversial intervention that passes electric shocks through the brain to cause a minor seizure, modifying brain activity. However TMS is very different. No pads or probes actually touch the patient's head. Instead, an electromagnetic coil sits a few inches above the targeted area. Electromagnetic pulses are then generated that target the specific area of the brain thought to be causing the problem. One effect of the electromagnetic pulse is unintended movement. Dodie Clark is receiving treatment for feeling spaced out much of the time In Dodie's case, the pulses make her jaw twitch with a regular clicking motion. ""At first, I was quite panicked by the whole situation, because it's quite freaky - like something's prodding your brain and making your face twitch when you don't want it to. ""A lack of control can be quite scary, but now I'm used to it,"" she says. ""When I first started getting ill, if I could see myself now, I'd be terrified. This is bizarre. But now that I'm here, I know it's not that bad. It's just a different kind of treatment, and it's important to show this."" ""There's no shame in any of this. There's no shame in mental health or seeking treatment at all."" The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) says the treatment shows no significant safety concerns. The institute says evidence about its effectiveness in the short term is ""adequate"" but ""variable"". Dr Chris Kelly, a consultant psychiatrist and a fellow of the Royal College of Psychiatrists, is an experienced practitioner of electro-convulsive therapy and is familiar with the TMS treatment. He says much more research is needed into its effectiveness in the field of depression. ""It may be useful to some people, particularly those who are intolerant to standard treatments,"" he says. ""At present, we know that it is of some use and not of particular harm. ""But the question is whether it's any better than established treatments that are already used to treat conditions like this - and that's what we don't yet know."" After completing her course of transcranial magnetic stimulation, Dodie hasn't so far found any improvement, and is undertaking other treatment. However, she says she would still recommend that others consider it. ""For me, I didn't find any difference, and that's difficult to talk about. But I think it needs more recognition and for people to know about it."" Follow Ciaranon Twitter,external How magnets treat depersonalisation.

"A vaginal ring to prevent HIV infection is popular with teenage girls, US scientists say. Women and girls aged 15-24 account for a fifth of all new HIV infections globally. Nearly 1,000 are infected every day in sub-Saharan Africa. Infused with microbicides, the ring,  which sits on the cervix, has beenshown to cut infections by 56%,external. Experts say it frees women from relying on men to wear condoms and allows them to protect themselves confidentially. Dr Anthony Fauci, the director of the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, told the BBC: ""If you can give women the opportunity to protect themselves in a way that is completely confidential - that's a long and big step to helping them. ""In societies where women are, unfortunately but true, somewhat second-class citizens, that makes women extremely vulnerable to getting infected with HIV."" The flexible ring, similar in size to the contraceptive diaphragm, releases an antiretroviral drug called dapivirine for a month. But scientists were unsure it would work in teenagers, who can be notoriously difficult when it comes to health advice. The six-month US trial gave the ring to 96 sexually active girls aged 15 to 17, who had not used it before. Data presented at the IAS Conference on HIV Science, showed: 87% of the girls had detectable levels of the drug in their vagina 95% said the ring was easy to use 74% said they did not notice the ring in day-to-day life There were some concerns before the trial that the girls' partners would not like the feel of the ring, but it reportedly enhanced pleasure. Drugs cocktail 'cut HIV deaths by 27%' Injections ânext revolutionâ in HIV Hunt for HIV cure turns to cancer drugs Aids deaths halve as more get drugs Prof Sharon Hillier, one of the researchers at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, said: ""HIV doesn't distinguish between a 16-year-old and an 18-year-old. ""Access to safe and effective HIV prevention shouldn't either, young women of all ages deserve to be protected."" There are now plans to test the ring with teenagers in Africa. If the ring gets regulatory approval, it would be the first method of prevention exclusively for women.

"""Unfair charges"" levied on buyers of new-build houses could be banned in England under a proposed crackdown. Leaseholds on new-build houses would be outlawed, while ground rents could be dramatically reduced, under government plans subject to public consultation. Ground rents can double every decade, crippling home owners and in some cases making a property impossible to sell. ""Enough is enough. These practices are unjust, unnecessary and need to stop,"" said Communities Secretary Sajid Javid. The proposals, which are subject to an eight-week consultation, apply only to England. Mr Javid said that there were 1.2 million cases of houses on leasehold, and the situation of escalating costs was one example of a ""broken housing market"". He said the proposals would affect future sales, but those already facing difficulties would generally need to seek redress from the housebuilder or, if the situation was not made clear at the point of sale, their solicitor. ""Builders and developers should be seeing what they can do to right some of the wrongs of the past,"" he told the BBC's Today programme. Builder sorry in leasehold 'scandal' The new property trap affecting thousands Four million leaseholders 'face rip-off' The leasehold system has existed for a long time in England and Wales, especially in blocks of flats. Leaseholders own their homes for a fixed period of time, on a ""lease"" to a freeholder, but many have long leases, for example for many decades, and experience no problems. Traditionally houses have nearly always been sold as freehold properties, meaning the buyer owns the building and land it is built on outright. But the trend for new-build houses being sold as leasehold has accelerated in recent years. Clair Scott's sale fell through owing to the leasehold Clair Scott says she bought her house as a leasehold and now cannot sell it because the ground rent is set to increase dramatically. One potential buyer dropped out after their solicitor advised them not to go through with the sale because of the high ground rent. ""It doubles every 10 years starting in 2020, so it gets to Â£10,000 a year by 2060,"" Ms Scott said. Sorry, your browser cannot display this map The government said the trend of new leasehold houses was a particular problem in the north-west of England. Leaseholders typically pay ground rent to the freeholder, but can be caught out by clauses allowing for dramatic increases in these fees, which come on top of management charges for the upkeep of communal areas. The Department for Communities and Local Government (DCLG) said the terms of some leases ""were becoming increasingly onerous"". It cited examples of: A homeowner being charged Â£1,500 by the freeholding company to make a small change to their family home A family home which is now impossible to sell because the ground rent is expected to hit Â£10,000 a year by 2060 A homeowner who was told buying the lease would cost Â£2,000 but the bill came to Â£40,000 MPs have described the situation as a ""national scandal"" and the ""PPI of the housebuilding industry"". The DCLG said its proposals aimed to make future leases fairer by reducing ground rents so they ""relate to real costs incurred"". About 21% of private housing in England is owned by leaseholders, with 30% of those properties houses rather than flats, according to figures from the Department for Communities and Local Government. This video can not be played ""Unfair charges"" levied on buyers of new-build houses could be banned in England Sajid Javid tells Today Mark Loveday, a barrister at Tanfield Chambers and a member of the Association of Leasehold Enfranchisement Practitioners (ALEP) says there is a considerable amount of legislation to protect people against unfair service charges. ""If a leaseholder is paying excessive service charges, they may issue court proceedings or complain to the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (RICS). Alternatively, leaseholders can contact members of ALEP who will offer expert advice on the issue. There is also the government-funded Leasehold Advisory Service (LEASE) which provides free advice to flat owners,"" he adds. ""However, the majority of leaseholders will take their disputes to tribunals. These are low-cost, low-fee specialist bodies which deal with the vast majority of service charge disputes. ""Tribunals have the jurisdiction to do various things such as determine service charges and enforce restrictions or allow a majority of leaseholders to take over the management of a building. Indeed, figures between 2004 and 2013 show that service charge and management claims in tribunals more than doubled in that period."" The Conveyancing Association trade body said it was researching ways to find a better method of tenure for properties with shared amenities. The House Builders Federation said: ""The industry is committed to working with all parties to ensure that the terms on which leasehold homes are sold are fair and work for the homeowner. ""Buying and selling apartments on a leasehold basis is a long accepted form of ownership and provides security for people with communal facilities. There are instances where houses need to be sold on a leasehold basis, for instance where land has been acquired from local authorities, other public bodies or the Crown on a leasehold basis."" Someone who owns a property outright, including the land it is built on, is a freeholder. Most houses are freehold but some might be leasehold - usually through shared-ownership schemes. With a leasehold, the person owns the property for the length of their lease agreement with the freeholder. Leaseholders have to pay their freeholders ground rent and other fees in order to make changes to their homes. When the lease ends, ownership returns to the freeholder unless the person can extend the lease. Some wish to buy their freeholds to save themselves these costs.

"The Greenland ice sheet covers an area about seven times the size of the UK Scientists are ""very worried"" that the melting of the Greenland ice sheet could accelerate and raise sea levels more than expected. They say warmer conditions are encouraging algae to grow and darken the surface. Dark ice absorbs more solar radiation than clean white ice so warms up and melts more rapidly. Currently the Greenland ice sheet is adding up to 1mm a year to the rise in the global average level of the oceans. It is the largest mass of ice in the northern hemisphere covering an area about seven times the size of the United Kingdom and reaching up to 3km (2 miles) in thickness. This means that the average sea level would rise around the world by about seven metres, more than 20ft, if it all melted. That is why Greenland, though remote, is a focus of research which has direct relevance to major coastal cities as far apart as Miami, London and Shanghai and low-lying areas in Bangladesh and parts of Britain. Algae were first observed on the Greenland ice sheet more than a century ago but until recently its potential impact was ignored. Only in the last few years have researchers started to explore how the microscopically small plants could affect future melting. A five-year UK research project known as Black and Bloom is under way to investigate the different species of algae and how they might spread, and then to use this knowledge to improve computer projections of future sea level rise. The possibility of biologically inspired melting was not included in the estimates for sea level rise published by the UN's climate panel, the IPCC, in its latest report in 2013. This video can not be played ""Like stepping onto the Moon"": Life on the ice That study said the worst-case scenario was a rise of 98cm by the end of the century. One concern now is that rising temperatures will allow algae to flourish not only on the slopes of the narrow margins of the ice-sheet but also on the flat areas in the far larger interior where melting could happen on a much bigger scale. We joined the latest phase of research in which scientists set up camp on the ice-sheet to gather accurate measurements of the ""albedo"" or the amount of solar radiation reflected by the surface. White snow reflects up to 90% of solar radiation while dark patches of algae will only reflect about 35% or even as little as 1% in the blackest spots. When we flew by helicopter onto the ice sheet, the rolling landscape seemed surprisingly grey - my first impression was that it looked dirty. Scientists are investigating the different species of algae and how they might spread Much of the surface was covered with what looked like patches of soot and it was pockmarked with countless holes at the bottom of which were pitch-black layers of a mix of algae, bacteria and minerals known as cryoconite. Prof Martyn Tranter of Bristol University, who is leading the project, told me: ""People are very worried about the possibility that the ice sheet might be melting faster and faster in the future. ""We suspect that in a warming climate these dark algae will grow over larger and larger parts of the Greenland ice sheet and it might well be that they will cause more melting and an acceleration of sea level rise. ""Our project is trying to understand just how much melting might occur."" Over the last 20 years, Greenland has been losing more ice than it gains through snowfall in winter - a change in a natural balance that normally keeps the ice-sheet stable. This video can not be played David Shukman explains how scientists live on an ice sheet - and how you go to toilet Biological darkening has not been built into scientists' climate projections And one of the project scientists, Dr Andrew Tedstone, a glaciologist and also of Bristol University, said that over much of the same period, images from the MODIS satellite showed a darkening trend with the years of greatest dark producing most meltwater. He said: ""We still don't think we've reached a point where we've seen the maximum darkness that we're going to see in this area so the fieldwork we're doing is to try to find out in a warming climate 'do we think the area is going to get any darker than we've already seen in the last 15 years?'"" Earlier research had found that the ice sheet is covered with a range of contaminants carried on the winds including dust and soot from as far away as Canadian prairie fires and the industrial heartlands of China, America and Europe. But studies over the past five years have shown that the majority of the dark material may be biological with different kinds of algae turning the ice black, brown, green and even mauve. ""This is a living landscape,"" according to Dr Joe Cook, a glacial microbiologist at Sheffield University. ""This is an extremely difficult place for anything to live but, as we look around us, all this darkness we can see on the ice surface is living - algae, microbes, living and reproducing in the ice sheet and changing its colour."" Ice retreat does not have to be total to have a damaging impact ""We know they're very widespread and we know that they're very dark and we know that that's accelerating melt but that's not something that's built into any of our climate projections - and that's something that needs to change."" The final phase of the Black and Bloom project involves weaving the new factor of biological darkening into climate models to come up with revised estimates for future sea level rise. And, as Dr Cook explained, the retreat of the Greenland ice sheet does not need to be total to have a widespread and damaging impact. ""When we say the ice sheet is melting faster, no one saying it's all going to melt in next decade or the next 100 years or even the next 1,000 years but it doesn't all have to melt for more people to be in danger - only a small amount has to melt to threaten millions in coastal communities around world."" Meanwhile, another factor that may be driving the melting has been identified by an Austrian member of the team, Stefan Hofer, a PhD student at Bristol. In a paper recentlypublished in Science Advances,external, he analysed satellite imagery and found that over the past 20 years there has been a 15% decrease in cloud cover over Greenland in the summer months. ""It was definitely a 'wow' moment,"" he told me. Although temperature is an obvious driver of melting, the paper estimated that two-thirds of additional melting, above the long-term average, was attributable to clearer skies. What is not known is how this might affect the algae. Their darker pigments are believed to be a protection from ultra violet light - so more sunshine might encourage that process of darkening or prove to be damaging to them. The Black and Bloom project, funded by the Natural Environment Research Council (Nerc), aims to publish its new projections for sea level rise in two years' time.

"The Department for Transport says London will have to fund half the upfront costs of Crossrail 2 and the government had not yet committed to public funding Government support for a new London rail line after scrapping projects in Wales and the north of England has been described as ""frankly outrageous"". Greater Manchester mayor Andy Burnham said there would be ""widespread anger"" at the decision to back the railway line, which will run through London. Liverpool City Region's mayor said there needed to be ""balanced spending"". The government said it was spending billions on infrastructure elsewhere. On Friday it was announced that the rail link between Manchester and Newcastle may not be fully electrified, despite promises from the previous government. Greater Manchester mayor Andy Burnham said: ""We can't wait forever, we need improvements now, that's why the electrification is important, and it's also why we need more capacity at Manchester Piccadilly. ""People travelling [to Manchester] across the northern cities who will have a long commute home, I think, will be furious... that the government has cut back on rail investment in the north on the day that it's green light to Crossrail 2. ""They're not governing for the whole country."" The Liverpool-Newcastle link was to be fully electrified, according to the previous government Crossrail 2, a north-east to south-west railway, which would tunnel beneath central London, could be running by 2033. It is estimated the scheme will cost about Â£30bn at 2014 prices and construction could start in the early 2020s. It would link Hertfordshire and Surrey, passing through Tottenham Hale, Euston-St Pancras, Tottenham Court Road, Victoria and Clapham Junction. Announcing the decision toback Crossrail 2,external, the Department for Transport (DfT) said Transport Secretary Chris Grayling and Mayor of London Sadiq Khan had agreed there was ""no doubt London needs new infrastructure to support its growth and ensure it continues as the UK's economic powerhouse"". Mr Grayling said: ""I am a supporter of Crossrail 2, but given its price tag we have to ensure that we get this right. ""The mayor and I have agreed to work together on it over the coming months to develop plans that are as strong as possible, so that the public gets an affordable scheme that is fair to the UK taxpayer."" Last week, the government was criticised for scrapping the planned electrification of railway lines in parts of England and Wales. At the time, Mr Grayling said the government would instead introduce faster trains with more seats and better on-board facilities. On Monday Mr Burnhamtweeted,external: ""On Friday, Tories say they can't afford rail schemes in the North. ""On Monday, they find billions more for London. Are these 2 things linked?"" He said: ""People here have had to put up with sub-standard rail services for decades and will simply not accept that spending billions more on London is the country's highest priority for transport investment."". He added that the fact the announcement had been made after Parliament had broken up for the summer was ""denying any real scrutiny"" of the decision. Liverpool City Region Mayor Steve Rotheram said that while he did not ""begrudge"" the investment in London and the South East, there needed to be balanced spending to ""support growth in the North as well"". London Mayor Sadiq Khan said: ""Crossrail 2 is essential for the future prosperity of London and the South East, so I'm pleased that the transport secretary and I have reached an agreement to take this vital project forward."" A DfT spokesman said that while it had agreed to work further with Transport for London on Crossrail 2, it said London needed to pay half of the upfront construction costs and that the government had not committed any public funding yet. The spokesman added that the government was spending Â£57bn on HS2, Â£1bn to improve rail infrastructure in the north of England and Â£800m on new road schemes.

"The three-year-old Eurasian wolf was found outside the park fence A wolf shot dead after escaping from Cotswold Wildlife Park may have climbed an electric fence. Visitors to the park were told to stay indoors when the female animal, named Ember, wasdiscovered outside the perimeter fence at 11:00 BST on Friday. The park's managing director said staff were too far away to tranquilise the three-year-old Eurasian wolf. An ongoing investigation by the park has found an electric fence was not properly charged. Earlier this year Ember gave birth to five cubs, the first wolves to be born at the park in its 47-year history. More on this and other stories from across the South of England Ember gave birth to a litter of five cubs earlier this year Managing director Reggie Heyworth said the park was still investigating how the wolf escaped, as there was no obvious breach in the fence. He revealed the charge on the electric fence was not at the level it should have been and said it was possible she climbed over the barrier. When keepers realised the animal was not in its enclosure the park's ""emergency plan"" was activated immediately. Mr Heyworth added: ""As a precaution, all visitors and other staff were notified immediately. Those that were indoors were asked to remain where they were. ""At no time were members of the public in any danger as the wolf was away from the visitor area throughout."" The wolf was found just outside the park's perimeter fence, towards the A361, and was shot by a member of staff. Cotswold Wildlife Park said there was no other option as its staff were too far away to guarantee a tranquiliser dart would work safely.

"A sharp rise in personal loans could pose a danger to the UK economy, a Bank of England official has warned. Outstanding car loans, credit card balance transfers and personal loans have increased by 10% over the past year, the Bank's financial stability director Alex Brazier said. In contrast household incomes have risen by just 1.5%, he said. ""Household debt - like most things that are good in moderation - can be dangerous in excess"", Mr Brazier said. Mr Brazier, in a speech to the University of Liverpool's Institute for Risk and Uncertainty, added that this increase in debt was ""dangerous to borrowers, lenders and, most importantly from our perspective, everyone else in the economy"". He warned that High Street banks were at risk of entering ""a spiral of complacency"" about mounting consumer debt levels. ""Lending standards can go from responsible to reckless very quickly. ""The sorry fact is that as lenders think the risks they face are falling, the risks they - and the wider economy face - are actually growing,"" Mr Brazier added. Mr Brazier hinted that the Bank of England could force banks to take further safeguards against the risk of bad debts if it was deemed necessary. Reality Check: Has personal debt been growing? Banks warned on ballooning consumer borrowing Just last month,the Bank of England told banksto beef up their finances against the risk of bad loans. They were told to set aside Â£11.4bn in the next 18 months in case future economic shocks meant some borrowers could not keep up their repayments. Mr Brazier said by September the Bank will have assessed whether the rapid growth in consumer lending ""has created any small gap in the line"". ""If it has, we'll plug it,"" said Mr Brazier. In June, Bank of England governor Mark Carney said lenders appeared to have forgotten some of the lessons of the financial crisis. Despite these concerns, Mr Carney stressed that the UK financial system was far stronger than at the time of the great banking crash in 2008-09.

"Using money to free-up time is linked to increased happiness, a study says. In an experiment, individuals reported greater happiness if they used Â£30 ($40) to save time - such as by paying for chores to be done - rather than spending the money on material goods. Psychologists say stress over lack of time causes lower well-being and contributes to anxiety and insomnia. Yet, they say even the very wealthy are often reluctant to pay people to do the jobs they dislike. ""In a series of surveys we find that people who spend money to buy themselves more free time are happier - that is they have higher life satisfaction,"" said Dr Elizabeth Dunn, a psychologist professor at the University of British Columbia, Canada. Rising incomes in many countries has led to a new phenomenon. From Germany to the US, people report ""time famine"", where they get stressed over the daily demands on their time. Psychologists in the US, Canada and the Netherlands set out to test whether money can increase happiness levels by freeing up time. More than 6,000 adults in the US, Canada, Denmark and the Netherlands, including 800 millionaires, were asked questions about how much money they spent on buying time. The researchers found that fewer than a third of individuals spent money to buy themselves time each month. Those who did reported greater life satisfaction than the others. The researchers then devised a two-week experiment among 60 working adults in Vancouver, Canada. On one weekend, participants were asked to spend Â£30 ($40) on a purchase that would save them time. They did things like buying lunches to be delivered to work, paying neighbourhood children to run errands for them, or paying for cleaning services. On the other weekend, they were told to spend the windfall on material goods. Material purchases included wine, clothes and books. The research, published in the journal,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences,external, found time saving compared with material purchases increased happiness by reducing feelings of time stress. ""Money can in fact buy time. And it buys time pretty effectively,"" said Prof Dunn, who worked with colleagues at Harvard Business School, Maastricht University and Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam. ""And so my take home message is, 'think about it, is there something you hate doing that fills you with dread and could you pay somebody else to do that for you?' If so, then science says that's a pretty good use of money.'' The psychologists say the study may help those who feel obliged to do a ""second shift"" of household chores when they come home from work. ""I think our work perhaps provides an escape route out of the second shift,"" Prof Dunn added. Past research has found that people who prioritise time over money tend to be happier than people who prioritise money over time.

"Drawings like this one prompted Lesbos volunteers to treat children's water trauma ""I call it reconciliation,"" says Manuel Elviro. He is part of a Spanish volunteer group that felt compelled to act after seeing some of the dramatic drawings by children who survived the perilous sea crossing from Turkey to Greece. ""There were monsters in the sea and people drowning."" The volunteers' task was to try to entice traumatised children on the island of Lesbos back into the sea to help them tackle their fears. As well as the terror of the crossing, the children had depicted the war zones they had fled and the filth of the refugee camps, rife with violence and sexual abuse. They say the sessions are not so much swimming lessons but a ""reconciliation"" with the sea ""Worst of all, they drew hopelessness,"" recalls Mr Elviro, a technology researcher from Spain's Balearic Islands University who volunteered forcharity Proem-aid,external. ""As I am from Mallorca, a Mediterranean man, I love my sea. It was like an affront. We had to do something."" Child migrantâs body sparks soul searching in Spain Why are 10,000 migrant children missing in Europe? Turkey threatens to scrap EU migrant deal Trying to stop ships rescuing migrants In 2016, some 173,000 people reached the Greek islands from Turkey. At one point, 2,000 migrants and refugees were reaching Lesbos every day and Proem-Aid says it saved about 50,000 lives. This video can not be played About 1,300 migrants have been sent back to Turkey since the EU deal in 2016 But an EU deal with Turkey last year has dramatically slowed that number to an average of up to 70 a day. The ""pull factor"" that some accuse NGOs of providing to migrants off the coast of Libya is not currently an issue on Lesbos. The period of relative calm gave the group more time to work with survivors in makeshift immigrant camps such as Pikpa, home to some of the most vulnerable individuals who have lost relatives or suffer disabilities. This drawing depicts those fleeing war walking atop a razor blade ""Many of the children are from Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan, and had never seen the sea before. It's a hostile environment for them,"" says Lara LussÃ³n, a volunteer who left her native Madrid for Lesbos in January. For Sahaar, 15, and her five-year-old brother Satria, their journey from Afghanistan to the gates of Europe ended in tragedy when their mother and two brothers aged eight and 12 were washed overboard. ""Sahaar screamed every time she saw the water,"" says Manuel Elviro. ""They were like koalas, clinging to us, saying 'Blue no good, blue no good'."" ""Now the danger is that they will get hypothermia because we can't get them out the water,"" he laughs. ""Sahaar said 'I'm going to Turkey', and I had to grab her by the leg and pull her out."" Child psychologists believe the best way of dealing with such trauma is to confront it The volunteers work with about a dozen children at a time on spring and summer afternoons, when the water is warm. ""They are not swimming lessons; it's not like a summer camp,"" he explains. Adam, a six-year-old Iraqi Kurd, arrived at Pikpa camp with an eye problem. His eyelids were glued together, possibly due to exposure to chemical munitions. ""We took him to the water to relax him while his eyes were getting better."" The best treatment for trauma is to confront it, argues Essam Daod, a child psychiatrist and co-founder of Humanity Crew, an NGO that addresses mental health issues among migrants in Greek camps. ""Swimming gives them a sense of control where they had none and fear was the sole master,"" Dr Daod told Spanish website eldiario.es. Manuel Elviro tells the story of a Syrian boy who lost his entire family in a bombardment. ""He told me: 'When I come with you to swim, that night I can sleep all right'."" The idea has recently been extended to include some of the children's mothers. The man-free sessions, known as ""women's own water"" have benefited migrants like Fahtia, who arrived from Somalia with a new-born baby. The work of the Spanish charity off the shores of Lesbos is not without controversy. Three Proem-Aid volunteers will face jail terms of up to 10 years if a trial due next April upholds charges of people smuggling and possession of illegal weapons. Volunteers Enrique RodrÃ­guez, Manuel Blanco and Julio Latorre (L-R) could face jail Manuel Blanco, Julio Latorre and Enrique RodrÃ­guez, all firefighters from Seville, were arrested by Greek coastguards in January 2016 on the waters off Lesbos as they were mounting a search-and-rescue mission for migrants. The Greek authorities consider that the knives the Spaniards were carrying constitute ""illegal weapons"". The volunteers argue the knives were the minimum blade length required to cut through ropes, nets or other material when rescuing people from the sea. Two Danish volunteers were arrested at the same time. A note on terminology: The BBC uses the term migrant to refer to all people on the move who have yet to complete the legal process of claiming asylum. This group includes people fleeing war-torn countries such as Syria, who are likely to be granted refugee status, as well as people who are seeking jobs and better lives, who governments are likely to rule are economic migrants.

"Rural Sicily can be a difficult place to run a business because of threats from the Mafia How a winemaker is taking on Sicily's rural Mafia From the terrace of his winery near the baroque town of Caltagirone in south-eastern Sicily, Cesare Nicodemo surveys his fields of ripening vines - a glass of his finest spumante in hand. It's a warm July evening and the surrounding hills glow golden in the setting sun amid the chirruping of swallows and the song of cicadas. It should be an image of rural peace and contentment, but on closer inspection, all is not quite as it seems. Security cameras on high stilts dot the perimeter of his land. The metal gates leading into his winery remain securely shut throughout our interview, and inside the winery's main building, images from across his vineyard flicker on a bank of screens. Listen to more from Manuela Saragosa on Sicily's rural Mafia This, he says, is what it takes to run a modern business in Sicily in 2017. Winemaker Cesare Nicodemo says the Mafia is trying to drive him off his land Cesare has been threatened, his land has been repeatedly trespassed on, his buildings have been damaged and trees cut down or set alight. He's even been physically attacked. ""The rural Mafia was trying to drive us off our land and destroy our business,"" he says between careful sips of wine. So who are the rural Mafia? Well, they're shepherds in the main - but some officials believe they're acting in cahoots with local lawyers, accountants and possibly even local politicians. Cesare believes the battle against them pits modern Italy against forces that want Sicily to remain rooted in the ways of the past. Driving out of his winery, he points out wooden stakes in the ground. ""See that?"" he says. ""They're the signs of the rural Mafia"" Wooden stakes marked with white cardboard ""a mafia sign"" says Cesare Nicodemo The stakes are dotted across the land around his vineyard. They're about a metre-long, distinctive for the strip of white cardboard wrapped round them. And they're a common sight in rural Sicily. There are more about 100km (60 miles) away from Cesare's winery, in the foothills of Mount Etna, where Sebastiano Blanco is rebuilding a house on his plot of land. ""What those stakes say is 'this land belongs to us',"" Sebastiano says. ""They, the rural Mafia, see all this land as their own, regardless of who has legal title to it."" Sebastiano Blanco in the ruins of his burnt-out house Like Cesare, he says there are local clans who believe that they, and not the Italian state, set the laws. Last year, Sebastiano's house was burnt down. The police and fire brigade said the fire was probably started by a homeless person who'd come inside to warm up. But Sebastiano thinks it's no coincidence that the fire happened soon after stakes appeared on his land. He believes the rural Mafia took revenge when he wouldn't hand over his land. He cuts a forlorn figure, kicking at the blackened rubble strewn across the charred ground of what were once his bedroom, with the early evening's purple sky visible through the exposed beams of his shattered roof. Sebastiano believes the Mafia burnt his house when he refused to had over his land So, what exactly is it that the Mafia wants? Giuseppe Antoci, president of Sicily's largest national park, Nebrodi, and co-ordinator of Federparchi Sicilia, the Federation of Sicilian National Parks, has been investigating the matter for the past few years. What he's uncovered is widespread fraud involving European Union farm and rural development funds. In an investigation conducted together with the deputy police commissioner Daniele Manganaro of the district of Messina, Mr Antoci found that local crime networks were falsely claiming land as their own - or presenting forged documents saying they had leased it - in order to make applications for EU subsidies. Police commissioner Daniele Manganaro says the Mafia's business now is in defrauding the EU ""We've seen an evolution of Mafia here,"" he says. ""This is not the Mafia of the illegal drugs trade or the trafficking of arms. It takes a lot of work and research to commit this sort of fraud. We're not talking about the Mafia that existed 30 years ago, where the shepherd demanded a ransom or protection payment from a tradesman. ""What we have here is a Mafia whose business is to commit fraud with EU funds. And to carry out this sort of fraud, you need more than just a shepherd. ""What it requires is a network of people, people with schooling and education, people who know how the system works, because the first step in perpetrating this sort of fraud is to set up a company,"" says the police commissioner. Mr Antoci has tried to put a stop to it. He's set in motion a new law that states that anyone claiming EU subsidies on land must now show anti-Mafia certification. In Italy, this means complying with regulations that require that a company's shareholders and directors have no restrictions, limitations and bans according to anti-mafia regulations. Giuseppe Antoci has led moves to pass new anti-mafia legislation Sceptics say this is hardly enough to stop the fraud from being repeated, pointing out that many will simply make use of proxies to make claims on their behalf. The European Union's anti-fraud office, Olaf, says it is reviewing 35,000 applications for agricultural subsidies in Italy covering some 500m euros in disbursements going back all the way to 2006. It has also started nine criminal proceedings, all of which involve a network of organised crime. But this 500m euros (Â£447m) that the EU is looking into is far less than the 3.5bn euros that Mr Antoci and the local police force say may have been fraudulently claimed. ""I can tell you that there is a very strong commitment at the level of the EU as well as the level of national authorities to fight this kind of phenomenon,"" says Francesco Albore, the head of the Olaf unit investigating the matter. Another 2.2bn euros have been earmarked in EU and Italian government funds for rural and agricultural development in the six years to 2020. So what guarantees are there that all those funds will be properly distributed? Mr Albore says it's difficult to guarantee but points out the EU also demands guarantees that payments go to the correct recipients. Where this is not the case, he says, ""payments can be stopped."" Meanwhile, back in Sicily, Mr Antoci's efforts to fight this fraud have come at a high personal price. In response he was ambushed last year - luckily he survived He's suffered death threats and now lives under permanent armed guard. Last year, as he was being driven home through the Nebrodi national park following a late night dinner, his car came under a volley of gunfire. If he's alive today, he says, it's only thanks to his armed guard and the fact that his car was being followed by that of the deputy police commissioner Daniele Manganaro who managed to scupper the attack by firing back. In the aftermath, there were attempts to discredit his investigation. Some Italian media reports questioned the authenticity of the attack, suggesting Mr Antoci and the local police force had made it up. But it's only made him more determined. ""You know, afterwards, they found petrol bombs hidden in nearby bushes,"" Mr Antoci says. ""They wanted me dead. But my first thought as I was being saved that night was for my family and for all the police officers who guard me - the sacrifices they have to make for this battle I've chosen to wage."" Still, one businessman I speak to, who's been subjected to similar threats for not handing over land, complains that he's had little support from local Sicilian political authorities in his fight to protect his land. How can this intimidation be happening, says Sebastiano Blanco Which is why, back in the foothills of Mount Etna, Sebastiano Blanco wears a T-shirt emblazoned with the words: ""Rural mafia - a protected species"". ""It's 2017,"" he says. ""How can this be happening in our day and age?"" He gestures at the smoking volcano, looming large in the distance over his land. ""This is a Unesco world heritage site,"" he says. ""But as long as we're intimidated this way, how can we possibly build on the economic value of our land and property?""

"Up to 75% of abattoir workers are estimated to be migrants, many from the EU The UK is ""overwhelmingly reliant"" on EU workers to enforce animal welfare and food hygiene standards in abattoirs, a group of peers has warned. The Lords EU Environment Committee said it was concerned 90% of slaughterhouse vets were EU nationals and it was vital they stayed in the UK after Brexit. Peers said there was no reason that general animal welfare standards should fall after the UK leaves the EU. But it warned of the threat to UK firms from cheap food imports. Guarantees over welfare standards should be written into future trade deals to protect the competitiveness of UK firms, the cross-party committee urges. Ministers say they expect environmental and welfare standards deriving from EU membership to be maintained, as a bare minimum, after the UK leaves the EU. Brexit: All you need to know Liam Fox downplays US-UK chicken issues Gove 'pragmatic' on farming Brexit But campaigners have warned they could be watered down, in some areas, as a precondition of free trade deals with the United States and other major food exporters. On a visit to Washington on Monday, International Trade Secretary Liam Fox had to downplay reports that concerns over the lifting of a ban on US chlorinated chicken could stand in the way of a free trade agreement between the US and UK. In its report, the committee said the UK was rightly proud of its high standards of animal welfare and that many of the laws in the area pre-dated the UK joining the European Economic Community in 1973. But it said the ""vast majority"" of recent legislation in the field originated in EU law and although the UK was converting all existing EU law on to the domestic statute book, the existing framework could be affected. ""We see no reason why Brexit should diminish animal welfare standards, as long as the government is aware of the challenges ahead and acts accordingly,"" said Lord Teverson, the Lib Dem peer who chairs the committee. But he added: ""We heard evidence of undeniable concern that opening up the UK market to free global trade poses a number of issues. We heard overwhelming support for farm animal welfare standards to be maintained or improved. To help achieve that, we urge the government to secure the inclusion of high farm animal welfare standards in any free trade agreements it negotiates after Brexit."" Lord Krebs, the former chair of the Food Standards Agency, told the BBC that no-one was saying that US beef or chicken was unsafe but that the UK could not ""have it both ways"" when it came to a future trade deal. ""The prime minister has said after Brexit we will maintain high welfare standards in this country,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. ""On the other hand we hear Liam Fox saying we want to do a trade deal with America and other countries which would encourage cheaper imports, with probably lower welfare standards. ""So that is the question - do we want to maintain our own industry with high welfare standards or do you want to race to the bottom and import the cheapest meat wherever it comes from around the world?"" The committee said vets played a key role in ensuring animals were slaughtered humanely and animal shipments were properly certified, citing warnings from the British Veterinary Association that demand for certification was likely to increase if the remaining EU nations were regarded as third-party countries after Brexit. Referring to BVA statistics suggesting more than 90% of official veterinarians, who provide government licensed services such as disease testing in animals and ante and post mortems in abattoirs, were non-UK EU nationals, it said: ""That is a concerning number because these are people who are working for our animal health, particularly in our abattoirs, and this has a knock-on effect for food safety and hygiene"". The BVA said official veterinarians, formerly known as local veterinary inspectors, had unique qualifications and were ""crucial for the protection of the UK consumer, certifying and supervising the import and export of animals and animal products to third countries"". The committee said it had been told by the National Farmers Union that vets also undertook many farm inspection and enforcement roles and the union was seeking reassurances that post-Brexit immigration controls would not limit access to experienced staff. The government has said all EU nationals living and working in the UK for five years will be entitled to apply for settled status, enjoying broadly the same rights as now, while more recent arrivals will also be guaranteed residency rights as long as they arrived before an as yet unspecified cut-off point. In response to the Lords report, the Department for the Environment said: ""Leaving the EU provides us with an opportunity to develop gold standard policies on animal welfare. ""We are determined to get a good Brexit deal for Britain, and we have been absolutely clear we will maintain our world-leading animal welfare standards,"" a spokesman added.

"Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko (second right) meets servicemen during a visit to Donetsk region in June The new US special representative for Ukraine says Washington is actively reviewing whether to send weapons to help those fighting against Russian-backed rebels. Kurt Volker told the BBC that arming Ukrainian government forces could change Moscow's approach. He said he did not think the move would be provocative. Russia warned that anything that heightened tension could jeopardise a solution to the conflict. Mr Volker, a former US permanent representative to Nato, was given the role in Kiev earlier this month. ""Defensive weapons, ones that would allow Ukraine to defend itself, and to take out tanks for example, would actually help"" stop Russia threatening Ukraine, he said in a BBC interview. Trump and Putin's first face-to-face talks meeting Trump and Putin: How do they compare? The latest on the Ukraine crisis ""I'm not again predicting where we go on this. That's a matter for further discussion and decision. But I think that argument that it would be provocative to Russia or emboldening of Ukraine is just getting it backwards,"" he added. He said success in establishing peace in eastern Ukraine would require what he called a new strategic dialogue with Russia. On a visit to the front line on Sunday Mr Volker had described the situation as a ""hot war"" that had to be addressed as quickly as possible. Responding to Mr Volker's latest remarks, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told the BBC: ""We have said more than once that any actions that provoke tension on the line of separation, that provoke a situation which is already complex, will only take us further away from the moment when this internal Ukrainian issue is resolved."" The UN says more than 10,000 people have died since the eastern Ukraine conflict erupted in April 2014, soon after Russia annexed Ukraine's Crimea peninsula.

"The metal detectors were removed after a late-night cabinet meeting Israel has removed metal detectors from outside a holy site in East Jerusalem after uproar from Palestinians over their recent introduction. It said it plans to replace them with less obtrusive surveillance. However Muslim leaders have called on worshippers to continue boycotting the sacred compound for now. There were deadly clashes after the metal detectors were set up, which Palestinians saw as an Israeli attempt to assert control over the site. Israel said they were necessary to prevent weapons being smuggled in. It followed thekilling on 14 July,externalof two Israeli policemen by Israeli-Arab gunmen, who police say had hidden their weapons on the hilltop site known to Jews as the Temple Mount and Muslims as Haram al-Sharif. The Israeli prime minister's office said the state security bodies had recommended replacing the metal detectors with ""advanced technologies and other means"". It said the new, unspecified, measures, costing 100m shekels ($28m; Â£21m), would be put in place over the next six months. Until then, extra police would be deployed around the site, it added. However, the Muslim body which oversees the holy compound, the Waqf, called on worshippers to stay away from the site until it advised otherwise. Many Palestinians had been refusing to visit the complex as long as the metal detectors were there, holding prayers in the street outside the Old City instead. Jerusalem's flashpoint holy site explained What makes Jerusalem so holy? Tom Bateman, BBC Jerusalem correspondent The crisis at this revered site was about much more than the existence of the airport-style gates and electronics of the metal detectors themselves. For Palestinians, their installation symbolised what they saw as an attempt by Israel to assert further control over the site of their holy shrine in occupied East Jerusalem - the mosque that also acts as a powerful symbol of their national aspiration. For Israel's government, the move represented the need to secure what one minister called ""the most sensitive location on Earth"" - Judaism's most holy place - after the murder of two Israeli police officers close by. Leaders will have felt pressure from within their own constituencies not to be seen to back down. International calls for a solution have added to the pressure on both sides - which were dealing with complex internal politics too - but it is still not clear this crisis has been entirely resolved. The installation of the metal detectors the day after the police were killed drew angry protests from Palestinians and days of clashes with Israeli security forces. The violence left four Palestinians dead in East Jerusalem and the occupied West Bank, while three Israeli civilians were stabbed to death by a Palestinian who had said he was avenging Israeli measures at the holy site. This video can not be played Jerusalem holy site security row explained On Monday theUN's Middle East envoy warnedof ""potential catastrophic costs"" even beyond the region if the issue was not resolved by Friday, when Muslims traditionally flock to the site for prayers. There is speculation that Israel agreed to remove the metal detectors in return for Jordan letting Israeli embassy staff leave the country following adiplomatic stand-off. Jordanian authorities wanted to question an Israeli security guard who Israel said shot dead a Jordanian who had attacked him with a screwdriver in a residence next to the embassy. A second Jordanian who died was inadvertently killed by the gunfire, Israel said. Jordan is the custodian of the Haram al-Sharif/Temple mount site Israel said the guard had diplomatic immunity and both he and all the staff were confined to the embassy compound amid attempts to find a solution. In a phone call on Monday night, Jordan's King Abdullah and Mr Netanyahu discussed the crisis surrounding the holy site and the incident at the embassy. The kingcalled on Mr Netanyahu,externalto remove the metal detectors. At around the same time, it was announced that the embassy staff had returned to Israel. Jordan, which has a large Palestinian population, has an historical role as custodian of the Jerusalem holy site. Mr Netanyahu's office said the embassy staff's return ""was made possible thanks to... tight co-operation"" with Jordan. The Temple Mount/Haram al-Sharif in Jerusalem's Old City is sacred to both Jews and Muslims. Jews revere it as the location of two Biblical Temples and holiest site in Judaism. It is also the al-Aqsa mosque compound, the third holiest site in Islam. The area, in East Jerusalem, has been under Israeli occupation since the 1967 Middle East war. Many Palestinians had refused to go through the metal detectors in protest The site is hugely politically sensitive and has been subject to a delicate set of arrangements - commonly referred to as the ""status quo"" - governing access, security and administration, for the past 50 years. Under the arrangement, Israel is responsible for security and a Jordanian-funded religious trust, or Waqf, looks after the day-to-day running of the site. Palestinians said the placing of the metal detectors upset the status quo, which Israel has repeatedly pledged to maintain. Israel said Palestinians were using the issue as a pretext to spread hostility against the Jewish state. Holy site metal detector row explained.

"This video can not be played Vlogger Dodie tells BBC Radio 5 live she is raising awareness of mental health issues by filming her treatment Depersonalisation disorder, sometimes known as DPD, leaves sufferers feeling like they're not part of the world they live in. ""I feel spaced out a lot of the time. I feel like I'm not really here, like I'm living in a dream,"" says Dodie Clark, a 22-year-old musician and vlogger from London. ""I can't open my eyes wide enough or see things properly."" The mental health disorder can lead to severe depression as emotions, empathy and wellbeing give way to a detachment and distance from daily life. Dodie says: ""It's caused me to have depression and anxiety. I noticed suicidal thoughts creeping in and that was definitely the point where I thought I need some help."" What causes the condition is not yet understood - and treatments such as medication and counselling aren't always effective. Dodie has suffered from depersonalisation for about two years, and is now trying out a fairly new treatment called trans-cranial magnetic stimulation. Known as TMS, it is currently available in only two NHS trusts and a handful of private clinics. It is a mainstream treatment in the US, but not the UK. Dodie allowed BBC Radio 5 Live to accompany her for a treatment at the Smart TMS clinic in Chelsea. At first sight, the therapy looks similar to electro-convulsive therapy, a controversial intervention that passes electric shocks through the brain to cause a minor seizure, modifying brain activity. However TMS is very different. No pads or probes actually touch the patient's head. Instead, an electromagnetic coil sits a few inches above the targeted area. Electromagnetic pulses are then generated that target the specific area of the brain thought to be causing the problem. One effect of the electromagnetic pulse is unintended movement. Dodie Clark is receiving treatment for feeling spaced out much of the time In Dodie's case, the pulses make her jaw twitch with a regular clicking motion. ""At first, I was quite panicked by the whole situation, because it's quite freaky - like something's prodding your brain and making your face twitch when you don't want it to. ""A lack of control can be quite scary, but now I'm used to it,"" she says. ""When I first started getting ill, if I could see myself now, I'd be terrified. This is bizarre. But now that I'm here, I know it's not that bad. It's just a different kind of treatment, and it's important to show this."" ""There's no shame in any of this. There's no shame in mental health or seeking treatment at all."" The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) says the treatment shows no significant safety concerns. The institute says evidence about its effectiveness in the short term is ""adequate"" but ""variable"". Dr Chris Kelly, a consultant psychiatrist and a fellow of the Royal College of Psychiatrists, is an experienced practitioner of electro-convulsive therapy and is familiar with the TMS treatment. He says much more research is needed into its effectiveness in the field of depression. ""It may be useful to some people, particularly those who are intolerant to standard treatments,"" he says. ""At present, we know that it is of some use and not of particular harm. ""But the question is whether it's any better than established treatments that are already used to treat conditions like this - and that's what we don't yet know."" After completing her course of transcranial magnetic stimulation, Dodie hasn't so far found any improvement, and is undertaking other treatment. However, she says she would still recommend that others consider it. ""For me, I didn't find any difference, and that's difficult to talk about. But I think it needs more recognition and for people to know about it."" Follow Ciaranon Twitter,external How magnets treat depersonalisation.

"""Unfair charges"" levied on buyers of new-build houses could be banned in England under a proposed crackdown. Leaseholds on new-build houses would be outlawed, while ground rents could be dramatically reduced, under government plans subject to public consultation. Ground rents can double every decade, crippling home owners and in some cases making a property impossible to sell. ""Enough is enough. These practices are unjust, unnecessary and need to stop,"" said Communities Secretary Sajid Javid. The proposals, which are subject to an eight-week consultation, apply only to England. Mr Javid said that there were 1.2 million cases of houses on leasehold, and the situation of escalating costs was one example of a ""broken housing market"". He said the proposals would affect future sales, but those already facing difficulties would generally need to seek redress from the housebuilder or, if the situation was not made clear at the point of sale, their solicitor. ""Builders and developers should be seeing what they can do to right some of the wrongs of the past,"" he told the BBC's Today programme. Builder sorry in leasehold 'scandal' The new property trap affecting thousands Four million leaseholders 'face rip-off' The leasehold system has existed for a long time in England and Wales, especially in blocks of flats. Leaseholders own their homes for a fixed period of time, on a ""lease"" to a freeholder, but many have long leases, for example for many decades, and experience no problems. Traditionally houses have nearly always been sold as freehold properties, meaning the buyer owns the building and land it is built on outright. But the trend for new-build houses being sold as leasehold has accelerated in recent years. Clair Scott's sale fell through owing to the leasehold Clair Scott says she bought her house as a leasehold and now cannot sell it because the ground rent is set to increase dramatically. One potential buyer dropped out after their solicitor advised them not to go through with the sale because of the high ground rent. ""It doubles every 10 years starting in 2020, so it gets to Â£10,000 a year by 2060,"" Ms Scott said. Sorry, your browser cannot display this map The government said the trend of new leasehold houses was a particular problem in the north-west of England. Leaseholders typically pay ground rent to the freeholder, but can be caught out by clauses allowing for dramatic increases in these fees, which come on top of management charges for the upkeep of communal areas. The Department for Communities and Local Government (DCLG) said the terms of some leases ""were becoming increasingly onerous"". It cited examples of: A homeowner being charged Â£1,500 by the freeholding company to make a small change to their family home A family home which is now impossible to sell because the ground rent is expected to hit Â£10,000 a year by 2060 A homeowner who was told buying the lease would cost Â£2,000 but the bill came to Â£40,000 MPs have described the situation as a ""national scandal"" and the ""PPI of the housebuilding industry"". The DCLG said its proposals aimed to make future leases fairer by reducing ground rents so they ""relate to real costs incurred"". About 21% of private housing in England is owned by leaseholders, with 30% of those properties houses rather than flats, according to figures from the Department for Communities and Local Government. This video can not be played ""Unfair charges"" levied on buyers of new-build houses could be banned in England Sajid Javid tells Today Mark Loveday, a barrister at Tanfield Chambers and a member of the Association of Leasehold Enfranchisement Practitioners (ALEP) says there is a considerable amount of legislation to protect people against unfair service charges. ""If a leaseholder is paying excessive service charges, they may issue court proceedings or complain to the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (RICS). Alternatively, leaseholders can contact members of ALEP who will offer expert advice on the issue. There is also the government-funded Leasehold Advisory Service (LEASE) which provides free advice to flat owners,"" he adds. ""However, the majority of leaseholders will take their disputes to tribunals. These are low-cost, low-fee specialist bodies which deal with the vast majority of service charge disputes. ""Tribunals have the jurisdiction to do various things such as determine service charges and enforce restrictions or allow a majority of leaseholders to take over the management of a building. Indeed, figures between 2004 and 2013 show that service charge and management claims in tribunals more than doubled in that period."" The Conveyancing Association trade body said it was researching ways to find a better method of tenure for properties with shared amenities. The House Builders Federation said: ""The industry is committed to working with all parties to ensure that the terms on which leasehold homes are sold are fair and work for the homeowner. ""Buying and selling apartments on a leasehold basis is a long accepted form of ownership and provides security for people with communal facilities. There are instances where houses need to be sold on a leasehold basis, for instance where land has been acquired from local authorities, other public bodies or the Crown on a leasehold basis."" Someone who owns a property outright, including the land it is built on, is a freeholder. Most houses are freehold but some might be leasehold - usually through shared-ownership schemes. With a leasehold, the person owns the property for the length of their lease agreement with the freeholder. Leaseholders have to pay their freeholders ground rent and other fees in order to make changes to their homes. When the lease ends, ownership returns to the freeholder unless the person can extend the lease. Some wish to buy their freeholds to save themselves these costs.
