"The seriousness of the shutdown was starting to show. President Donald Trump's decision toendorse a deal to reopen the federal governmentfor three weeks on Friday came amid mounting pressure to end the impasse. Here are four reasons from the business world why the White House blinked. Delays at major airportson Friday brought to a head issues that had been affecting airports for weeks. The issues were blamed on staff shortages, as air traffic controllers and screening officers - who have been working without pay since the start of the shutdown in December - failed to report for duty. Among Transportation Security Administration officers, unexpected absences had more than doubled from a year ago, to more than 7%, with many citing ""financial limitations"", according to the agency. Meanwhile, airline executives had warned that a fall in government business, as well as wider concerns about travel, were affecting bookings. Southwest, for example, estimated that the shutdown cost $10m-$15m (Â£7.6m-Â£11.4m) in January revenue. It also said it was forced to postpone a new service to Hawaii. Coast Guard families pick up groceries at a food pantry The 800,000 federal workers affected by the shutdown might have been able to absorb one missed pay cheque. But a second one starts to hurt - especially in a country where an estimated 40% of adults don't have funds to cover an unexpected $400 expense. In the Washington region, where an estimated one in six workers was affected, the shutdown could have shaved 2.5% off the region's quarterly economic growth if it lasted through March, according to Frederick Treyz, chief economist for Regional Economic Models Inc. What is a government shutdown? #ShutdownStories: The impact of the government shutdown That's in an area that expanded 2.1% in 2017. Despite the pain, the administration was widely criticised for being unsympathetic and the issue started to hurt the president's approval ratings. Widely criticised comments by Commerce Department Secretary Wilbur Rosson Thursday, who said cash-strapped households should take out loans, didn't help. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome ""Jay"" Powell has warned about the impact of the shutdown The shutdown coincided with a critical time for the economy, as conflicting economic signals aggravate debates about how much higher the Federal Reserve should raise interest rates this year. Mr Trump has repeatedly criticised the Fed, warning against a misstep. But wider fears of a policy error were growing, as the impasse halted the release of closely watched statistics, including gross domestic product (GDP), retail sales and housing starts. ""The US economy is flying blind,"" Robert Shapiro, the chairman of Sonecon LLC,wrote for Brookings Institution,externalthis week. ""The fact that reliable measures of recent GDP and its components are unavailable can only generate more economic uncertainty as well as wrong business decisions."" Meanwhile, the data coming in suggested the shutdown wasn't helping. This month, the University of Michigan's survey of consumer sentiment,externalfell to its lowest point since US President Donald Trump was elected, due in part to the shutdown. A top White House adviser said this week the shutdown could lead to zero economic growth this quarter. And economists had warned that a prolonged stand-off could send the US into recession. Cutbacks at government agencies have left breweries and other firms waiting for permits The Trump administration worked hard to shield the wider public from the effects of the shutdown, recalling staff to process items such as tax returns. But as the stand-off continued, its impact was becoming harder to ignore. The federal court system warned,externalit would exhaust its funding this month. Food subsidies for low-income families were expected to run out in February. A growing number of businesses were in limbo, as government cutbacks halted fisheries permits, approvals for beer and wine labels, and listings on the stock exchange. And contractors that provided services to affected agencies were losing more than $200m a day due to the shutdown, according to estimates by Bloomberg News. Greg Fitzgerald is president of the Virginia-based contractor Information Technology Coalition. At a Chamber of Commerce event on Friday, he said his firm has yet to be paid for government work it completed in December and he had to place 200 of the firm's 350 staff on leave. ""It's real,"" he said. ""There are families out there that are going to make significant sacrifices for something that wasn't their fault.""

"Critics suggested the 81-year-old multimillionaire's comments were ""out of touch"" US commerce secretary Wilbur Ross has attracted scorn for suggesting workers affected by the ongoing government shutdown should take out bank loans. ""True, the people might have to pay a little bit of interest,"" he told broadcaster CNBC. ""But the idea that it's 'paycheck or zero' is not a really valid idea."" Critics derided the multimillionaire for being out of touch. About 800,000 federal workers will miss another payday on Friday. The US government shutdown is now the longest in history and there is no clear end in sight afterthe Senate rejected two bills aimed at ending the impasse. President Donald Trump is demanding $5.7bn (Â£4.4bn) for a proposed southern border wall which the Democratic Party refuse to fund, saying it would be ineffective and immoral. All you need to know about Trump's border wall Eighteen ways the US shutdown is hurting 'I can't get my meds because of Trump' In the interview, Mr Ross seemed puzzled that federal workers who have been without pay since 18 December would go to food banks. Borrowing from a bank is ""in effect federally guaranteed"", he said. There are some ""very, very low interest rate loans"" on offer, he added. Allow Twitter content?

""Put it in perspective: you're talking about 800,000 workers, and while I feel sorry for individuals who have hardship cases, 800,000 workers if they never got their pay... you're talking about a third of a percent on our GDP,"" he said.

President Trump defended his commerce secretary, in remarks which also drew criticism. While telling reporters he had not heard Mr Ross's words, and suggesting he maybe ""should have said it differently"", Mr Trump said people should try to ""work along"" with banks and grocery stores during the shutdown.

"This video can not be played Commons Leader Andrea Leadsom tells Newsnight the EU could grant the UK a âcouple of extra weeksâ to finalise Brexit The EU could be ready to drop some of its ""red lines"" from the Brexit deal it struck with the UK to ""help"" save it, Chancellor Philip Hammond has said. He did not believe the EU would scrap the backstop plan to keep the border open between Northern Ireland and Ireland. But some EU leaders were ""looking at what they can do"" to change it. Andrea Leadsom has, meanwhile, said the EU would delay Brexit for a ""couple of weeks"" to help get a deal through. Could EU offer an extra 'couple of weeks'? Troops 'could return to Irish border' How many trade agreements has the UK done? New Brexit poll 'should not be last option' She told the BBC's Newsnight that due to our ""very strong relationship"" with the EU, a short extension would be ""feasible"". But Downing Street said: ""There is no change to our position. ""We are not considering an extension to Article 50 and are committed to doing whatever it takes to have the statute books ready for when we leave the EU on 29 March this year."" The UK is set to leave the EU on that date, with or without a deal. Theresa May is battling to get her plan through Parliament, despite the fact it suffered an historic defeat in the Commons last week - losing by 432 votes to 202. A major part of the loss was because of the controversial backstop, which is the fallback position for after Brexit to ensure a hard border is not introduced. Without a hard border, there will be no checks on people or goods passing between the two countries - as it is now. Critics claim the backstop plan separates Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK by keeping it more closely aligned to EU rules. But its backers say it will prevent political tensions rising along the border. This video can not be played Reality Check unpacks the basics of the backstop. Downing Street said it was continuing conversations with MPs to address a range of concerns about the backstop ahead of the plan returning to the Commons on Tuesday - including with hard-line Brexiteers in the Tory Party and the DUP, which supports the government in Parliament but voted against her deal. Both sets of MPs have said they will not vote for the PM's deal while the backstop is part of it. No 10 admitted they were ""not there yet"" with a new proposal to take to Brussels, but said there was a clear message from the EU that they wanted the UK to leave with a deal and, in order to do so, there will have to be some changes. Some backbench MPs are trying to make the deal more palatable by removing, replacing or time-limiting the backstop, while others are trying to force ministers to delay Britain's departure from the EU for up to a year if MPs can't agree on a deal by 26 February, to prevent a no-deal Brexit. Please upgrade your browser Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme from Davos earlier, Mr Hammond said leaving with a withdrawal agreement was the ""only credible and sustainable way"" forward and warned of ""very significant disruption"" for the UK economy if the country left the EU without a deal. But he claimed some European politicians were ""thinking very hard about where the European Union has drawn its red lines [and] whether they really need to be in the place where they have been drawn"". He added: ""What I am hearing from European politicians and commentators is that they do take this issue very seriously, they understand the challenge that we have got at home and generally - not all of them, but many of them - want to help. ""They are not prepared to compromise on the fundamental principles that the EU has set out, but they certainly are looking at whether there is anything they can do without compromising those principles."" French finance minister Bruno Le Maire said it was up to the British government to find a way out of the situation, not EU member states. He told Today that the backstop issue was ""done"" and the EU had ""nothing to give"" on the Brexit deal apart from ""clarifications"". Mr Hammond said the French had ""always been the hardest in this debate"" and talking to other European politicians would offer ""a more balanced view"". By Chris Mason, BBC political correspondent Speak to people from the government in private, and some will tell you they think minds are moving on their own side. They hope some Brexiteers are open to compromise; willing to climb down, if only they can be provided with a ladder. And now the chancellor has said in public that perhaps the EU is willing to budge at least a bit too. On Tuesday, MPs will get a chance to express their views on a range of possible options, which could, depending on how the day plays out, hand the prime minister numerical evidence that Parliament may be able to support a variation of her Brexit deal - if the EU is willing to compromise too. Publicly, the EU is saying what it has always said - the withdrawal agreement is finished and it isn't being re-opened. So, the big question will be, is anything Parliament could potentially coalesce around and vote through also palatable to the EU? We are not likely to get any indication of that until at least the middle of next week. In an interview with BBC's Newsnight, Mrs Leadsom said she believed the government could still get Mrs May's deal through Parliament before 29 March. But, she added: ""In spite of everything, we have a very strong relationship with our EU friends and neighbours and I am absolutely certain that if we needed a couple of extra weeks or something then that would be feasible. ""We would want to think carefully about it, but as things stand, I do feel that we can get, with the support of both houses - the House of Commons and the House of Lords - with goodwill and a determination, we can still get the legislation through in time."" Read more from the Newsnight interview on Nick Watt's blog The deputy leader of the DUP, Nigel Dodds, said he had been ""encouraged"" by a change in tone from Europe - namely a speech by the EU's chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, who said on Wednesday that they would ""have to find an operational way"" of carrying out checks without putting a hard border between Ireland and Northern Ireland. Mr Dodds called it a ""new and more realistic approach"" and ""a long way from the dramatic language EU spokespeople were using this time last year"". But Mark Francois, a Tory MP and vice chairman of the pro-Leave European Research Group, said: ""The only thing that we would contemplate is if the entire backstop is removed from the [deal]."" ""They'd have to take it out lock, stock and barrel. I don't know whether the EU would be prepared to do that, but if they're not, then we're not going to support it."" On Thursday, the German boss of Airbus, Tom Enders criticised Brexiteer ""madness"" and said his company might have to make ""potentially very harmful decisions for the UK"" in the event of it leaving the EU with no deal. Airbus currently employs 14,000 workers in the UK and every wing on its commercial aircraft is currently made here. In a video message, Mr Enders said: âPlease donât listen to the Brexiteersâ madness which asserts that âbecause we have huge plants here we will not move and we will always be hereâ. They are wrong.â But Mr Francois hit back in a live interview on BBC News, tearing up Mr Enders' words and saying: ""My father, Reginald Francois, was a D-Day veteran. He never submitted to bullying by any German and neither will his son.""

"This video can not be played Rescuers are searching for hundreds of people, missing after a dam collapse caused a huge mudslide Nearly 300 people are missing after a dam collapsed at an iron ore mine in south-eastern Brazil, officials say. The break caused a sea of muddy sludge that buried the dam's cafeteria where workers were eating lunch on Friday. Rescue teams used earth-moving machinery at the site near the town of Brumadinho, in Minas Gerais state. State governor Romeu Zema said there was little chance of finding people alive. So far 11 people have been confirmed dead. It is not clear what caused the collapse of the dam, owned by Brazil's largest mining company, Vale. In pictures: Aftermath of dam collapse The 2015 dam disaster in Minas Gerais On Saturday, President Jair Bolsonaro flew over the disaster area in a helicopter. He tweeted that it was hard not to get ""emotional"" after seeing the scale of the devastation. President Jair Bolsonaro said all efforts were being made to rescue survivors He said he had accepted an offer by Israel to send search equipment that could find people buried in the mud. Also on Saturday, Brazil's Environmental Protection Agency (Ibama) issued Vale with an initial fine of 250m reais ($66.5m; Â£50m) in relation to the incident. Meanwhile a sum of 5bn reais has been frozen from Vale's accounts by a court to help fund recovery works and handle damage claims. The collapse comes just over three years since a dam burst in Mariana, also in Minas Gerais, killing 19 people, in what is consideredBrazil's worst environmental disaster. The dam near FeijÃ£o iron ore mine burst its barrier at around 13:00 local time (15:00 GMT) on Friday, flooding another dam down below. The torrent of sludge cut through the dam's complex, nearby farms and the neighbourhood where many of the workers live, destroying houses and vehicles. There are reports that the dam's alarm system - which local residents had been trained to respond to - failed at the time of the accident. But Vale president Fabio Schvartsman said the accident may have occurred too quickly for a siren which triggers security protocols to be activated. The Globo website later reported that rescue officials provided the following breakdown on the number of the missing: Between 100 and 150 people in the administrative area close to the burst dam About 30 people in the Vila VÃ©rtico area About 35 people at Nova Estancia Inn Between 100 and 140 people in the Parque das Cachoeiras Dozens of trapped people, many of them covered in mud, had to be evacuated by helicopter as roads were destroyed. Many other residents have been evacuated as a safety measure. ""I'm anxious, I want news,"" 28-year-old Helton Pereira told the BBC as he waited outside a hospital in nearby Belo Horizonte - his 28-year-old wife and 35-year-old sister worked at the dam's cafeteria and were both missing. ""From now, the odds are minimal and it's most likely we'll recover only bodies,"" Governor Zema said. The dam is owned by Brazil's largest mining company, Vale Hopes are fading for survivors The powerful current swept everything in its way Built in 1976, the dam was one of several in the area and it was used to hold residue from the mine. It had capacity for 12m cubic metres and had been an inactive site for three years, Vale said. Mr Schvartsman called it a ""human tragedy"" and said a German company, hired to assess the dam, indicated in the most recent report last September that it was stable. The firm said it was monitoring all its other dams. A report by Folha de S.Paulo newspaper said therisk of collapse of the dam had been mentioned in a ""tense meeting"" that approved its licence,externallast month (in Portuguese). Roads have been destroyed by the sludge, complicating rescue efforts The environmental activist group Greenpeace said the dam break was ""a sad consequence of the lessons not learned by the Brazilian government and the mining companies."" It said the incidents ""are not accidents but environmental crimes that must be investigated, punished and repaired"". On 5 November 2015, a dam - also owned by Vale, along with BHP Billiton - burst at a Samarco mine in Mariana. More than 60m cubic metres - enough to fill 20,000 Olympic swimming pools - spilled over into the surrounding area.

"This video can not be played Footage showed the moment the rider and her horse were hit A triathlete who hit a horse during the cycling section of a race has been ordered to pay Â£926. Iain Plumb, 32, of Crowthorne, Berkshire, was taking part in the Royal Windsor Triathlon when he hit the horse and rider, causing the animal to bolt. Organisersbanned the 32-year-old for life from races following the incident on 17 June 2018. Plumb was found guilty of riding without due consideration after a trial at High Wycombe Magistrates' Court. Footage showed the moment the rider and her horse were hit when cyclists passed on both sides in Oakley Green Road, Dedworth. The manoeuvre caused the horse to jolt and the rider cry out. The rider previously said the impact bruised her ankle. PC Peter Dorling, of Thames Valley Police, said: ""Plumb's cycling fell well below what is expected for a cyclist. ""Thankfully the horse was not injured."" Plumb was fined Â£216 by High Wycombe magistrates on 21 January. He was also ordered to pay Â£50 in compensation to the horse-rider, a victim surcharge of Â£30 and court costs of Â£630.

"President Ghani, who took office in 2014, revealed the figure at the World Economic Forum Afghan President Ashraf Ghani says more than 45,000 members of the country's security forces have been killed since he became leader in 2014. The figure is far higher than previously thought, with Mr Ghani saying late last year that 28,000 had been killed since 2015. ""The number of international casualties is less than 72,"" he said on Friday. ""It shows who is doing the fighting."" His comments come amid top-level talks between US and Taliban representatives. The Taliban, the main insurgent group in Afghanistan, said on Thursday that they had held four days of face-to-face talks with US officials seeking to end 17 years of war. It is not clear if the talks have continued into Friday, but earlier reports said negotiators were progressing towards a deal. Why Afghanistan is more dangerous than ever Can Afghan military turn the tide in Taliban fight? Who are the Taliban? ""Since I've become president... over 45,000 Afghan security personnel have paid the ultimate sacrifice,"" Mr Ghani said atthe World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. ""We need to get a stable Afghanistan that can ensure the security of Americans, Europeans, and others on the one hand, but more fundamentally our own democratic rights and institutions,"" he added. Mr Ghani's decision to reveal new death toll figures is unusual. The Taliban frequently carry out deadly attacks targeting military bases, soldiers and police,externaland in recent years US and Afghan officials have withheld detailed casualty figures as they are deemed too sensitive. Analysis by Anbarasan Ethirajan, BBC South Asia Regional Editor It's a staggering casualty figure - nearly 30 deaths a day - for any military. A record number of Afghan police and troops have been killed since most international combat troops withdrew from the country by the end of 2014. The admission from Mr Ghani came during a bad week for the forces. A few days ago,a devastating attack on an intelligence training centre killed more than forty troops.The daring assault took place around 50 km (30 miles) from the capital, Kabul. Afghan officials may justify the high casualty rate, saying they are now doing most of the fighting - not the international forces. But many analysts have described the current death rate as unsustainable and utterly demoralising for the Afghan military. Military observers say that Afghan soldiers are spread too thin on the ground and the Taliban exploit this by attacking isolated posts, check points and bases with ferocity. The Taliban feel that the momentum is on their side, and that's why they are talking to the US, but refusing to engage with the Kabul government. The Taliban's power and reach have surged since foreign combat troops left Afghanistan in 2014. The US/Nato-backed military is struggling to cope, and attacks are becoming more frequent and much deadlier. Large parts of provinces like Helmand and Kandahar - where hundreds of US, UK and other foreign troops were killed - are now under Taliban control. Meanwhile, civilian casualties are at an unprecedented level. According to the UN, more than 10,000 civilians were killed or injured in 2017.

"Stuart Wells pleaded guilty to two charges of causing serious injury by dangerous driving A driver who caused a crash in which a mother lost her unborn child has been jailed for more than three years. A court heard Stuart Wells, 29, may have fallen asleep at the wheel when he drove head-on into two cars on the B3151 at Somerton, Somerset, in March. Jackie Luxon, who was pregnant, and her two-year-old daughter were both seriously injured in the crash. Wells, of Sherborne, Dorset, admitted two charges of causing serious injury by dangerous driving. He was jailed at Taunton Crown Court for three years and seven months and banned from driving for six years and 10 months. Wells had initially tried to blame a sneeze for the crash but later accepted the case against him. Sentencing him, Judge David Ticehurst said: ""Mr and Mrs Luxon were looking forward to the birth of their child in a few weeks and the fact she is not recognised by the law no doubt adds to their sense of loss."" Jackie Luxon's car was hit head-on by Stuart Wells on the B3151 at Somerton last March The court heard other motorists had seen Wells' Ford Fiesta repeatedly drift in and out of the opposite carriageway over a seven-mile period, while also driving in excess of the 40mph speed limit. One driver described him as a ""real nuisance"" and said he was ""driving aggressively"". The court was told Mrs Luxon's husband had just bought a new car and she was following behind when the crash took place. Wells clipped Mr Luxon's car and crashed head-on into Mrs Luxon's car. In victim impact statements, Mr and Mrs Luxon said that in one-split second ""unquantifiable"" pain had been inflicted upon them. They said: ""In the space of a few hours we lost one child and another was placed in a medically-induced coma."" Mrs Luxon added: ""Our unborn daughter is not recognised in English law as she did not experience life outside my body. ""It's heartbreaking that no prosecution was made for the loss of her life and I hope that this is taken into consideration and changes are made in the law.""

"Police cordoned off several areas of Castle Cary on Wednesday A man has been charged with attempting to murder a police officer after shots were fired in a town centre. Daniel Hannam is accused of firing at officers during a three-hour stand-off in Castle Cary, Somerset, in the early hours of Wednesday morning. The 32-year-old, of no fixed address, is facing a total of 11 charges, which relate to the firearms incident and a raid in Yeovil on 17 January. He is due to appear at Taunton Magistrates' Court on Saturday. The charges include armed robbery, possessing a firearm with intent to cause fear of violence, possessing a shotgun without a certificate and possessing a firearm while convicted. Avon and Somerset Police previously said they were called to a property in Park Street, Castle Cary, following reports of gunshots at about 01:30 GMT on Wednesday. A spokesman said armed officers surrounded the property for several hours and shots were exchanged, but no-one was injured. The force said they had referred Wednesday's incident to the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC). However, the IOPC has since confirmed it will have ""no involvement in the case and that the matter remains with the force to investigate"".

"Air staff unions have issued warnings about the shutdown's impact Staff shortages linked to the federal government shutdown caused significant flight delays at north-eastern US airports on Friday. The shutdown has meant some federal staff, like air traffic controllers, have been working without pay. Nancy Pelosi, Speaker of the House of Representatives, took to Twitter to blame the president for the disruption. Hours later,Mr Trump announced a deal to fund the governmentand lift the shutdown temporarily. Friday's delays came one day after air industry unions issued a stark warning about the risk the shutdown was posing to public safety. In total about 800,000 federal employees have been working without pay, or have been temporarily laid off, since funding to areas of the government halted 35 days ago. These numbers include air traffic controllers, as well as US airport security screening staff. Trump 'loves and respects' unpaid workers #ShutdownStories show impact Trump's border wall in charts The shutdown started in December, when President Trump refused to approve any new funding agreement that failed to include $5.7bn (Â£4.4bn) for his southern border wall. The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) have reported high absences Democrats in Congress refused to agree to those terms - so the two sides had been stuck at an impasse before Mr Trump's most recent announcement. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) halted arrivals for nearly an hour at New York's LaGuardia Airport shortly before 10:00 (15:00 GMT). It blamed air traffic staff shortages for the strategic closures - which also delayed flights at Newark Liberty International Airport and Philadelphia International Airport. One passenger, named John Hitt, told the Reuters news agency he had to cancel a trip to visit his terminally ill aunt because of the delays. LaGuardia airport said in a tweet on Friday afternoon that lengthy delays at the airport were ongoing. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

There have been widespread reports about high absences among US airport security staff for a number of weeks. On Thursday, the CEO of JetBlue Airways said the shutdown's impact on carriers had so far been limited, but warned it was nearing a tipping point. Southwest Airlines head Gary Kelly has described the shutdown as ""maddening"" - estimating they have lost out on $10-15m (Â£7.5-11m) in January sales. On Friday, the Association of Flight Attendants issued a blistering statement in response to the delays. Passengers are reporting significant delays still at LaGuardia ""The aviation system depends on the safety professionals who make it run. They have been doing unbelievably heroic work even as they are betrayed by the government that employs them,"" President Sara Nelson said in a statement. ""They are fatigued, worried, and distracted - but they won't risk our safety."" Mr Trump's backing to re-open the government serves as a temporary solution but if no longer agreement is implemented, funding will  lapse again on 15 February. Speaking at the White House on Friday, he described federal workers affected by the shutdown as ""incredible patriots"". He also said they would receive the full back-pay they have missed.

"The US government has been partially shutdown for the longest time in history ""Now that I have nothing to help me stabilise my mood, I'm just very worried that I'm going to start having more bad days than good days."" Jazz Sexton works for the US government - or at least did until just before Christmas. She's not been to work since 21 December and is running out of money, which means she's been unable to renew her anti-depressants prescription. Since then the US government has been partially shut down, with President Donald Trump refusing to approve a budget unless it includes $5.7bn (Â£4.43bn) to fund a wall on the border with Mexico - something the opposition Democratic Party has rejected. ""I thought for sure it could not last more than two weeks,"" Jazz, who works as a trainee for the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), told Radio 1 Newsbeat. ""Everyone who I was in training with, we were a little excited at the prospect of having a few days off with a shutdown because Christmas was on a Tuesday, so we had Monday and Tuesday off and we thought well, if there's a shutdown for the rest of the week for Christmas, that's OK. Jazz lives with and looks after her elderly parents ""Obviously now I was a little naive in that because we're in our fourth week. And it's been very difficult."" The shutdown, which Jazz says she blames on President Trump and ""racist rhetoric in the US"", has affected about a quarter of the federal government - meaning 800,000 employees haven't been paid. Jazz joined the IRS in October and didn't have any savings from her previous job. She says that with no end to the shutdown in sight, she's down to her last couple of hundred dollars - which is needed to help out with rent. And because she joined so recently, her healthcare hadn't been properly processed before the shutdown. ""So I haven't been able to renew my prescriptions for my medication that I've been on for the last few years,"" Jazz says. ""I've had to wean myself off 40mg tablets, down to 20mgs and then down to 10mgs. And yesterday was my very last day - I don't have any more."" This is a quarter of an anti-depressant pill - the last one Jazz had Jazz says the anti-depressants she needs cost anywhere between $900 and $1000 (between Â£700 and Â£800) for between 30 and 90 days of medication - money she simply doesn't have. ""It means I just can't predict how I'm going to feel from day to day. I'm having a pretty good day today, I feel like everything's alright today. ""A couple days ago I felt like I just wanted to go to sleep and not wake up again. I felt like all of my choices that I've ever made in life were just terrible choices and that I'm bad at being a person."" The stress of not knowing when she'll be able to go back to work isn't helping, but Jazz is doing what she can to help her mental health - going on walks, exercising. She's also used some of the time off to apply for other jobs. ""When I started this job with the IRS, I felt that this was my pathway to financial stability, finally. Obviously at this moment it is not that. ""I'd like to stay with the IRS, but if this is going to go on as President Trump said for months, or even years, I have no idea at this point. So I'm looking into finding that financial stability that I need."" Jazz has swapped reading books for applying for jobs Timothy Nicholson is an economist at the Environment Protection Agency (EPA). And despite not being paid since 28 December, he insists he's ""one of the lucky ones"". ""I don't have a family to take care of or any kids so I was able to save enough money to hopefully get through the next few months."" His friends weren't quite so fortunate though. ""I didn't buy very many Christmas gifts. It sort of seemed like a shutdown was in the works for a little while, so I definitely cut back on my spending quite a bit from then until now."" The 26-year-old says he's been reducing the amount of money he pays back on his student loans over the past year so that he could save for a potential emergency like this. But even that might not be enough. ""Right now I'm OK but if this goes on for much longer, I'm going to start panicking."" Government workers have been protesting in Washington Both Jazz and Timothy stressed that while things can seem pretty bad for them, it's worse for other people. ""Most government employees don't get paid all that much to begin with so it's definitely pretty tough for others,"" Timothy says. ""I've seen a few new food banks temporarily open here in DC. ""One particular chef, Jose Andres, has been great in terms of making sure that workers who are downtown are able to get free lunches - and he's also opening a new food kitchen for government workers on Wednesday here, which is very nice of him."" Jazz is worried that if the government shutdown rolls on into February, it will start to seriously affect people who rely on state benefits. ""Some people rely on welfare completely for their income. That goes towards food, and if they don't have that the food banks might be overflowing with people, and it's just a huge strain on the resources for everyone in the country."" Government shutdowns aren't all that unusual, but this one is now the longest in US history - and it doesn't look like either side is ready to budge. There has been speculation that President Trump could declare a state of emergency in order to bypass Congress and get the money he wants for his wall. He called that the ""easy way out"" though, saying he'd prefer Congress to solve the problem. ""If they can't do it... I will declare a national emergency. I have the absolute right,"" he added. For Jazz, an end to the shutdown would mean not only job stability but stability in terms of health too. ""If the shutdown were to end, the federal government would be able to process my health insurance application as a new hire for the IRS and I would be able to renew my prescriptions and continue to be a healthy individual.""

"The plan would let people communicate with anyone on the currently separate apps Facebook plans to integrate its messaging services on Instagram, WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger. While all three will remain stand-alone apps, at a much deeper level they will be linked so messages can travel between the different services. Facebook told the BBC it was at the start of a ""long process"". The plan was first reported in the New York Times and is believed to be a personal project of Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg. Once complete, the merger would mean that a Facebook user could communicate directly with someone who only has a WhatsApp account. This is currently impossible as the applications have no common core. The work to merge the three elements has already begun,reported the NYT,,externaland is expected to be completed by the end of 2019 or early next year. By Chris Fox, technology reporter Facebook probably didn't want to talk about this in the middle of a privacy scandal, but its hand was forced by insiders talking to the New York Times. Until now, WhatsApp, Instagram and Messenger have been run as separate and competing products. Integrating the messaging parts might simplify Facebook's work. It wouldn't need to develop competing versions of new features, such as Stories, which all three apps have added with inconsistent results. WhatsApp, Messenger and Instagram are run as competitors Cross-platform messaging may also lead the way for businesses on one platform to message potential customers on another. And it might make it easier for Facebook to share data across the three platforms, to help its targeted advertising efforts. But bigger still: it makes Facebook's suite of apps a much tighter, interwoven collection of services. That could make the key parts of Facebook's empire more difficult to break up and spin off, if governments and regulators decide that is necessary. Mr Zuckerberg is reportedly pushing the integration plan to make its trinity of services more useful and increase the amount of time people spend on them. By effectively joining all its users into one massive group Facebook could compete more effectively with Google's messaging services and Apple's iMessage,suggested Makena Kelly,externalon tech news site The Verge. ""We want to build the best messaging experiences we can; and people want messaging to be fast, simple, reliable and private,"" said Facebook in a statement. ""We're working on making more of our messaging products end-to-end encrypted and considering ways to make it easier to reach friends and family across networks,"" it added. The statement said there was a lot of ""discussion and debate"" about how the system would eventually work. Facebook ignored kidsâ spending problems Facebook fined Â£500,000 for data scandal Will Facebook be fined after hack attack? Linking the three systems marks a significant change at Facebook as before now it has let Instagram and WhatsApp operate as largely independent companies. The NYT claimed that Mr Zuckerberg's championing of the plan to connect the messaging system had caused ""internal strife"". It was part of the reason that the founders of both Instagram and WhatsApp left last year. The decision comes as Facebook faces repeated investigations and criticisms over the way it has handled and safeguarded user data. Comprehensively linking user data at a fundamental level may prompt regulators to take another look at its data handling practices.

"This video can not be played Destination UK: Following illegal migrants for a week, through four European ports The number of migrants waiting for their asylum claims to be processed in the UK is ""unacceptably high"", an internal Home Office document seen by BBC News says. Asylum registration should be completed in 10 days but the leaked report says it is taking 17. The delays could leave the Home Office ""open to criticism or possible legal challenge"", it says. The Home Office said it did not comment on leaked documents. Reality Check: How many people seek asylum in the UK? Is it asylum seekers, migrants or refugees? The report also said that in the last three months of 2018, applications for asylum hit their highest level since the European migrant crisis in October 2015. This was more than 20% higher than the Home Office office expected. However, it said asylum applications in the UK had remained broadly stable in the 18 months up until that point. The report, dated January 2019, also highlighted the pressure being felt in Kent due to boats carrying migrants arriving on the coast. But the Home Office told the BBC these made up only a very small proportion of the total number of asylum claims. According to the document, there is now a backlog of claims waiting to be processed which is ""unacceptably high"". It says the delays are ""unfair on those who have claimants who need us to process a significant event in their lives"". It also said the delays could cause ""reputational damage to the Home Office"". In 2017, there were 26,350 asylum applications made in the UK. This compared with 198,255 applications made in Germany, 126,550 in Italy and 91,070 in France. In the UK, 31.8% of 21,290 decisions awarded some protection to the asylum seeker. Before an asylum claim can be registered, the Home Office has to interview the asylum seeker to establish their personal details. At the interview, officials will also find out about any vulnerabilities the person might have and whether they need accommodation or financial support while their claim is being processed. The document sets out a plan for recovering from the backlog at three immigration centres across the country - known as asylum intake units. These centres - in Kent, Bedfordshire and Croydon, south London - conducted around 78% of interviews with asylum seekers in the UK from April 2016 to March 2017.

After they have made an application, they will go to a ""screening"" - a meeting with an immigration officer - where they will be asked why they want asylum. Following that, they will undergo an interview during which they are asked to explain and show evidence of how they were persecuted in their home country and why they are afraid to go back.

"According to a Netflix documentary about his political career, Roger Stone convinced Donald Trump to run for president Roger Stone is a long-time political strategist and former ally of President Donald Trump who was convicted on charges including lying to Congress but was later pardoned by Mr Trump. Mr Stone was given a 40-month jail sentence in February 2020 after a trial in Washington DC. However, he never served jail time as Mr Trump commuted his sentence in July, days before he was due to report to a federal prison. He was then pardoned in the last weeks of Mr Trump's presidency. Mr Stone was arrested in January 2019 in connection with Special Counsel Robert Mueller's probe into alleged collusion between Russia and the Trump campaign. A political veteran, Mr Stone has worked with Republicans since the 1970s and even bears a tattoo of Richard Nixon on his back. But who is the self-described ""dirty trickster"" and why was he put on trial? Roger Stone was found guilty of seven criminal counts of lying to the House of Representatives' Intelligence Committee, obstructing justice and witness tampering. His conviction is connected to statements he made about the Trump campaign's efforts to obtain emailshacked by Russia to undermine Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign. These emails were published by WikiLeaks. Some of the lies were about the existence of certain emails and texts. Others related to Mr Stone's conversations with Trump campaign officials and a reported ""intermediary"" with WikiLeaks in early 2016. Prosecutors said he lied about the date of those conversations, and the identity of the intermediary. Trump ally Roger Stone convicted of lying to Congress Disgraced Trump aide runs for Congress Trump pledges to 'investigate the investigators' Mr Stone was also convicted of tampering with a witness - comedian Randy Credico, whom Mr Stone told Congress was the WikiLeaks back channel - when they were called to testify before Congress and speak with the FBI. In messages Mr Stone sent to Mr Credico, he told him to ""prepare to die"", and called him ""a rat"". Mr Stone also told him: ""Stonewall it. Plead the Fifth. Anything to save the plan."" Both Mr Stone and Mr Credico have since said that Mr Credico was not the WikiLeaks intermediary. During the trial, prosecutor Aaron Zelinsky told the jury that Stone - whose activities had long been scrutinised by both the FBI and the Senate - lied ""because the truth looked bad for the Trump campaign"". Mr Stone denied the charges, but was convicted on 15 November 2019. Sentencing him on 20 February, Judge Amy Berman Jackson said Mr Stone had engaged in ""intolerable"" ""threatening and intimidating conduct"" toward her. In addition to the jail sentence, Mr Stone had been due to serve two years' probation after his custodial sentence. He was also fined $20,000 (Â£15,500). Born in Connecticut in 1952, Mr Stone first got involved in politics at the age of eight, agitating for Democratic candidate John F Kennedy. ""I remember going through the cafeteria line and telling every kid that Nixon was in favour of school on Saturdays,""the strategist told the Washington Post in a 2007 interview,external. ""It was my first political trick."" Roger Stone, seen here with Ronald Reagan, has worked on Republican political campaigns since the 1970s But Mr Stone would begin his professional career helping out on Richard Nixon's 1972 re-election campaign. Congressional hearings in 1973 called to investigate the Watergate scandal reportedly revealed Mr Stone had hired a Republican operative to infiltrate Democratic candidate George McGovern's campaign, and sabotaged a Republican challenger to Nixon. The revelations cost him his job for then-Senator Bob Dole, but Mr Stone insists he did not break any law. ""The reason I'm a Nixonite is because of his indestructibility and resilience,""he told the New Yorker in an interview,external, shortly after he had the 37th president's face tattooed between his shoulder blades. ""Women love it,"" he said. Roger Stone, centre, pictured in 1985 with Paul Manafort, left, and Lee Atwater Stone went on to work on Ronald Reagan's successful presidential runs in 1980 and 1984, and aided George HW Bush's election in 1988. But Richard Nixon still seems to hold special significance for Mr Stone - aside from the tattoo, he has a room of Nixon memorabilia in his office in Oakland Park, Florida. In the 1990s, Mr Stone worked as a lobbyist for Donald Trump's casino business, and later helped Mr Trump's unsuccessful White House run in 2000. According to the Netflix documentary Get Me Roger Stone,the strategist reportedly encouraged Mr Trump to run for the presidency,external. Stone helped Donald Trump in his failed bid for the presidency in 2000 While serving on Mr Trump's campaign in 2015 the pair allegedly had a falling out - Mr Stone says he quit, while Mr Trump said he had fired the operative. But days laterMr Stone wrote a piece for Business Insider,externalin support of the Republican candidate, titled ""The man who just resigned from Donald Trump's campaign explains how Trump can still win"". Since Mr Trump's election,the president distanced himself from Mr Stone,external. This, despite Mr Stone regularly appearing on television to defend his former employer. His Twitter account was temporarily suspended in 2017after the strategist attacked journalists on the site, allegedly using homophobic language to target CNN presenter Don Lemon. Mr Stone threatened to sue the platform, saying he had been ""inundated on Twitter with bloggers threatening to kill me... yet Twitter seems unconcerned about that"". This video can not be played Trump says what people think, says strategist Roger Stone The political veteran's dress code has also garnered attention. He reportedly does not wear socks, and favours custom-made suits. ""If life is a stage, then you should always be in costume,""he told the New York Times in 2015,external. ""And if you are trying to connote a certain authority in your business life, I think being well dressed is part of that.""

"This video can not be played Roger Stone exited court flashing a Nixonian double-V sign Political strategist Roger Stone, a long-time ally of President Trump, has been arrested in Florida, charged with seven counts in the Mueller probe. Mr Stone, 66, appeared in court in the city of Fort Lauderdale. The indictment includes,externalone count of obstruction of an official proceeding, five counts of false statements, and one count of witness-tampering. The charges are linked to an alleged Russian-led hack into the emails of Democratic Party officials. The information contained in the emails was released by Wikileaks during the 2016 US presidential election campaign. CNN reports that FBI agents arrested Mr Stone in a pre-dawn raid on Friday. One pounded on the door and said, ""FBI, open the door,"" the US cable network says. After news of his old friend's arrest, President Donald Trump slammed the Russia investigation once again on Twitter, calling it the ""Greatest Witch Hunt in the History of our Country!""

Mr Stone appeared in court in Fort Lauderdale The special counsel has accused Mr Stone of attempting to obstruct the investigation into Russian meddling by: Lying to the House Intelligence Committee about what transpired between him and Wikileaks Lying to the committee about records of his interactions with Wikileaks Witness tampering, for trying to keep his Wikileaks intermediary from telling the truth to Congress The indictment does not say Mr Stone committed any criminal activity during the election. He was released on a $250,000 (Â£189,000) bond, but with restrictions allowing him to travel only for court appearances in Florida, Washington DC and New York. After his court appearance, Mr Stone spoke on the phone to conspiracy theorist Alex Jones on his radio programme Infowars. ""I intend to fight for my life,"" Mr Stone said as he launched a fundraiser for his legal battle. ""There's no circumstance under which I would plead guilty to these charges. ""There's no circumstance under which I would bear false witness to the president."" He added: ""Once again, there is no evidence of Russian collusion, Wikileaks collaboration and I'm not charged with doing anything inappropriate or illegal to assist in his [Mr Trump's] election."" Protesters outside chanted ""lock him up"" as Mr Stone exited the courtroom Mr Stone then emerged from court grinning broadly while flashing a Nixonian double V-sign and wearing a blue Ralph Lauren polo shirt. He maintained his innocence though was at times inaudible because of loud boos and chants of ""Lock him up!"" Mr Stone said he would formally plead not guilty to the charges in a Washington DC court next week. He declared himself the target of ""a politically motivated investigation"" and criticised the manner of his arrest. ""At the crack of dawn, 29 FBI agents arrived at my home with 17 vehicles with lights flashing. They terrorised my wife [and] my dogs."" This video can not be played Roger Stone was arrested at home in Fort Lauderdale Hillary Clinton's 2016 campaign chairman John Podesta, who was targeted in the email hack, accused Mr Stone of knowing about it beforehand. More than a month before the emails were made public, Mr Stone tweeted it would soon be Mr Podesta's ""time in a barrel"", which critics say indicates he already knew about the hack. Mr Stone has denied having advance knowledge of the cyber-breach and any knowing contact with Russian agents. On Friday, Mr Podestareferenced the cryptic tweet in a post,externalabout Mr Stone's indictment, noting it was ""Roger's time in the barrel"". Roger Stone is a political lobbyist and an ally of President Donald Trump According to investigators, Mr Stone said he had ""communicated"" with Wikileaks founder Julian Assange before the emails' release and had described the contact as ""perfectly legal"". The indictment accuses the lobbyist of lying to the House Intelligence Committee about what passed between him and Wikileaks, and of falsely claiming not to have records of it. Mr Stone is said to have spoken to senior Trump campaign officials - who are not identified - about ""organization 1"" [believed to be Wikileaks] ""and information it might have had that would be damaging to the Clinton Campaign"". Prosecutors say Mr Stone was also contacted by unnamed ""senior Trump campaign officials"" to inquire about future Wikileaks releases. They also allege he made false statements about his communications with conservative writer and conspiracy theorist Jerome Corsi regarding the Wikileaks email leak. The indictment points to conversations about the planned Wikileaks release to the public between Mr Stone and ""Person 1"" and ""Person 2"", who are not identified by name. Lawyers for Mr Corsi confirmed he is ""Person 1"" in the indictment on Friday, adding that they believe he is not accused of any wrongdoing in the Mueller investigation. Mr Stone has worked on Republican political campaigns since the 1970s His campaign activities have long been under scrutiny by Special Counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating allegations of collusion between Russia and the Trump campaign. In 2016, US intelligence agencies concluded that Russia had tried to turn the election in Mr Trump's favour through state-sponsored cyber-attacks and fake news stories spread on social media. The Mueller investigation has also focused on Mr Stone's communications with Twitter persona Guccifer 2.0, which US intelligence officials say is a front for Russian military intelligence. Mr Trump has repeatedly assailed the Mueller inquiry. The Kremlin has always denied meddling in the US election. Who is Trump confidant Roger Stone? All you need to know about Trump Russia story The president's counsel, Jay Sekulow, said: ""The indictment today does not allege Russian collusion by Roger Stone or anyone else. Rather the indictment focuses on alleged false statements made to Congress"". Tom Perez, chair of the Democratic National Committee, accused the Trump campaign of being ""a willing and active participant in a conspiracy with Russia and Wikileaks"" in a statement. Mr Perez added that ""there are more conspirators yet to be held accountable - and at least one of them is named Donald Trump"". Mr Stone has repeatedly said in interviews that he expected to be indicted. In May he told NBC's Meet the Press: ""It is not inconceivable now that Mr Mueller and his team may seek to conjure up some extraneous crime pertaining to my business, or maybe not even pertaining to the 2016 election."" Through past indictments Robert Mueller has been building the case that Russians were behind the hacking of senior Democratic and Hillary Clinton campaign officials. He alleges they then used Wikileaks to inject damaging information they garnered into the US political bloodstream at a time most harmful to Democrats. What the special counsel's office had yet to allege is that there were any ties between Wikileaks and the Donald Trump presidential campaign. On Friday Mr Mueller charged long-time Trump adviser and confidant Roger Stone with being that missing link, citing communications between Mr Stone and ""senior"" Trump campaign officials before and after the Wikileaks documents were released. The move marks a significant development in this nearly two-year legal drama. For the first time a member of Mr Trump's inner circle, albeit an informal one, is facing charges directly related to Russian election meddling - the central thrust of the special counsel's investigation. Mr Stone has denied suggestions of criminal misconduct. But the man who has boasted of being a master of the political dark arts, and who seemed to crave the notoriety that went along with such claims, now finds himself directly in the centre of a withering legal spotlight. Mr Stone is the 34th person to be charged as part of the Mueller investigation. Those indicted include 12 Russian military officers and 13 Russian nationals accused of leading a campaign to interfere in the US election. Another three Russian entities, including the Internet Research Agency ""troll farm"", have also been charged. Mueller disputes Buzzfeed's Trump report Russia-Trump: Who's who in the drama to end all dramas? Several people connected directly with Mr Trump have been indicted, including his former national security adviser Michael Flynn, and Paul Manafort, the former chairman of his election campaign, who is in jail. Mr Trump's former personal lawyer Michael Cohen and former campaign adviser George Papadopoulos have also been charged. An old friend of Donald Trump, Roger Stone has worked on Republican political campaigns since the 1970s. A self-proclaimed Republican ""dirty trickster"", he favours three-piece suits and reportedly does not wear socks.

Mr Stone became embroiled in the Watergate scandal after congressional hearings revealed that he hired an operative to infiltrate the campaign of George McGovern, Mr Nixon's Democratic opponent. He went on to work for Ronald Reagan's successful presidential campaigns in 1980 and 1984, and advised George HW Bush in his bid for the White House in 1988.

"It was more gripping than any box set we could get our hands on. Over two years, the investigations into Russian interference in the US election, and whether the Trump campaign colluded with the Kremlin, delivered daily developments and drama worthy of anything seen in House of Cards. In the end, 35 people and three companies were charged by Robert Mueller, the special counsel who investigated Russian interference in the 2016 election. Here's our guide to the main characters in the four seasons of the only political drama that mattered. This was the season in which Donald Trump, the reality TV star, took centre stage in his own political drama by launching a presidential campaign. He was supported by his family and got the attention of the Russians. The season ended with a cliffhanger - could Trump the outsider actually win?! It's been a while since all of this happened, so let's remind you of the key players in this season. Who was he?Donald Trump, the billionaire candidate (who by Season Three is the 45th president of the United States). If you really need a refresher,here's his life story. Key plot lineAs Donald Trump was busy traversing the country canvassing for votes in Season One, Russia hacked into the emails of his Democratic rivals, investigators later said. The question is why? Was the Kremlin trying to alter the outcome of the election, and what did Trump and his campaign know? Skip forward to the end of Season Four and Mr Trump stood triumphant before reporters in a Florida airport, celebrating what he called ""a complete and total exoneration"". But in between, there was no shortage of drama or tension. Who was he?He was Trump's campaign chairman before being forced to quit over his ties to Russian oligarchs and Ukraine. Key plot lineHe was one of the biggest dominoes to fall. When he ended up being arrested, it was a big season-ending shocker. Manafort hung around a bit in Season One, but then disappeared from view for a while. He quit the campaign after being accused of having links to pro-Russian groups in Ukraine. He also sat in on a crucial meeting with a Russian lawyer who may have been trying to feed the Trump team classified information (more on that later). After an FBI raid on his home in Season Three, Manafort was found guilty on eight charges of tax fraud, bank fraud, and failing to disclose foreign banks accounts and is sentenced to 47 months in prison. In Season Four, he agreed to co-operate with a special counsel inquiry in exchange for a reduced prison term. But then, in a twist - prosecutors claimed he breached his plea bargain by repeatedly lying to the FBI. Read more:The man who helped Trump win Who was he?The president's eldest child, who it emerged met some questionable Russians. Key plot lineDonald Trump Jr's role in this unfolding saga all came down to a meeting he had with a Russian lawyer, which was set up by a music publicist (the full details of which come out in Season Three). If it sounds random, then in many ways it is. The publicist, Rob Goldstone, offered Trump Jr a meeting with lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya, promising him dirt on Hillary Clinton. This meeting was the key to much of our plot line because it raised several key questions. Did this amount to the campaign colluding with a foreign government? Why did he agree to the meeting? What happened at the meeting was the scene investigators played over and over again as they tried to work out if there was any impropriety. In the end, no collusion charges were brought. Read more:Trump Jr's habit for making headlines DonaldTrumpconfounded his critics by winningthe presidency.But the transition was as gripping as the season before it as Trump picked his cabinet, introducing key characters to the mix. The season ended with Trump taking the oath of office on a cold January morning - but there were more twists to come. Who was he?The granite-faced former general who later became the shortest-serving member of Donald Trump's cabinet. He resigned after not being honest about his contact with a Russian official - and was later charged with making false statements to the FBI. Key plot lineFlynn was appointed national security adviser just days after the election, against the advice of then-President Obama, who warned Trump not to hire him. Flynn's starring role came in December 2016, just before Trump was sworn in, when he spoke to the Russian ambassador, Sergei Kislyak. The Washington Post and New York Times said the men discussed Russian sanctions, and that Flynn later lied to the Vice President Mike Pence about the conversation (Mr Kislyak says the men discussed only ""simple things""). The substance of those talks eventually led to Flynn being prosecuted as part of the investigation led by special counsel Robert Mueller. At the end of Season Three, in December 2017,Flynn pleaded guiltyto making ""false, fictitious and fraudulent statements"" to the FBI about what he and Kislyak discussed. With that, the investigation reached Trump's inner circle. Read more:Out after 23 days - who is Michael Flynn? Who was he?Many roads in this drama led back to Sergei Kislyak, the jolly and charismatic figure, who up until July 2017 wasthe Russian ambassador to Washington. Key plot lineKislyak's role in this drama remained unclear up to the end - but many of the players in this drama had meetings with him, and that put them in awkward spots. The key questions for investigators were: why were they drawn to him, and what was said? The Russian ambassador spoke to both Flynn and Attorney-General Jeff Sessions - meetings which both Trump officials didn't initially acknowledge took place. Anything else we should know? Well, Russia fiercely fought back against claims on CNN that Kislyak was a ""top spy and recruiter of spies"". Who was he?Jefferson Beauregard Sessions III hovered in the background during Season One, when he was an Alabama senator and a trusted Trump adviser, but we really got to know him during Season Two, when he became Trump's nominee for attorney general, a job he kept for almost two years. Key plot lineSessions was one of several Trump aides to meet Russian ambassador Sergei Kislyak, and question marks emerged over the nature of those meetings. When the FBI investigation focused on the Trump campaign, Sessions stood down from the inquiry, much to Trump's irritation. That decision to step down dogged him to the end, and he was written out of the series close to the end of Season Four, when Trump forced him to resign. That move put control of the Mueller investigation into the hands of a Trump loyalist. Read more:An attorney general dogged by scandal This was where the drama really picked up and all the plot lines came together. A lot of the background characters we saw in Season One came back with a vengeance and the infighting got nasty - and this is when the police started circling. Who was she?A Russian lawyer with a fearsome reputation who fought against US restrictions on Russia. But was she a Kremlin stooge? Despite earlier denials, she admitted in April 2018 to being an ""informant"" for Russia's prosecutor general. Key plot lineHers was a small but crucial role - she's the one who Manafort, Trump Jr and Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner met in June 2016, the details of which begin trickling out a year later in a flashback sequence. She said the meeting was to discuss adoptions - but those who helped set it up said she was offering dirt on the Democrats and Hillary Clinton's campaign. While the meeting became a central plot point, whatever happened inside never actually led to any charges. That meeting would never have happened without... Who were they?Emin Agalarov is Azerbaijan's biggest pop star, of course. Have you not heard Love is a Deadly Game? Emin helped bring Donald Trump's Miss Universe competition to Russia and the two are close enough tosend each other birthday messages,external. His dad, Aras, is a billionaire who mixes in the highest circles of influence in Moscow. Key plot lineAgain in a flashback scene, we met Emin as he set the wheels in motion on that Trump Jr meeting. An email sent to Trump Jr suggested Emin was offering information on the Democrats (Emin said he wasn't). The email also said Aras Agalarov had apparently met the ""crown prosecutor"" of Russia - a role that weirdly didn't exist - and got information on Hillary Clinton. Are you keeping up? Read more:The tough-talking networker Who was he?He became deputy attorney general under Jeff Sessions. In the TV drama of the Russia scandal, this is the sort of role that would go to a solid Broadway actor you recognise but can't put a name to. Key plot lineWhen Sessions stood down from leading the main investigation into the Trump-Russia ties, it fell to Rosenstein to do that job. In a major plot development, he appointed a special investigator - not a popular move with the White House. Read more:Who is Rod Rosenstein? Who was he?Married to Trump's daughter, Ivanka, Kushner was the character who was seen but very rarely heard. Key plot lineAmid cries of nepotism, he was given a plum White House job as senior adviser to the president with a wide-ranging portfolio. It was his contacts with the Russians during the election campaign and beyond that led investigators to circle him. In June 2016, Kushner attended THAT meeting with Donald Trump Jr and the Russian lawyer. He said he was so bored he messaged his assistant to call him so he could leave. Kushner was also another character who had repeated contact with Russian ambassador Sergei Kislyak - contact that he initially failed to disclose. Read more:The son-in-law with Trump's ear Who was he?A British former tabloid journalist, with a penchant for selfies in silly hats, was perhaps an unlikely addition to the cast, but in most good dramas there's always room for the slightly out-of-place eccentric. Key plot lineRob Goldstone found his way into Donald Trump's circle of trust thanks to his connections with Russian pop star Emin Agalarov. Goldstone managed the pop star, and it was he who contacted Donald Trump Jr on behalf of his client to set up that now-infamous meeting at Trump Tower in June 2016. Goldstone sent an email to Trump Jr promising dirt on Hillary Clinton. Read more:The Music Man with a love for hats Who was he?At 6ft 8in, James Comey was a towering figure, the character who gave little away about himself personally but had a huge role in this story. Key plot lineHe first entered this drama in Season One, when as head of the FBI he reopened the investigation into Hillary Clinton's emails - just weeks before the election. Democrats blamed him for her loss, Republicans hailed him a hero. That, we thought, was the last we'd seen of him. Jump ahead to Season Three, when months into the Trump presidency, Comey was fired by the new president. In true television drama style, he learned of his sacking as he was watching TV news during a trip to LA. Up to then, Comey was heading up an investigation into possible ties between the Trump campaign and Russia. Even by the end of the series, whether this amounted to obstruction of justice by the president remained an unresolved plot point. Comey's testimony to the Senate was one of the most set-pieces in the series up to this point, as  - under oath - he told politicians he was asked to pledge loyalty to the president, but refused. Read more:The FBI director who took centre stage Who was he?A former election adviser to Trump, although you'd be forgiven if you didn't remember the face. He was in only a few scenes in Season Two, but he had a massive role to play in Season Three, becoming the first person to plead guilty as part of the investigation. Key plot lineIn late October 2017, court documents emerged showing Papadopoulos had pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about the timing of meetings with alleged go-betweens for Russia. After lying to the FBI, he deleted an incriminating Facebook account and destroyed a phone. His guilty plea and co-operation with the investigation had the potential to damage the US leader because it related directly to his campaign - but in the end, it didn't do so. Read more:Why Papadopoulos case matters Who was he?The man who held the fate of the Trump presidency in his hands. Key plot lineSome characters wielded a lot of power, but didn't have a starring role, such as Robert Mueller, the tall chiselled figure who was appointed as ""special counsel"" to take over the Russia investigation after the dismissal of James Comey. Mueller came from the same stock as Comey - both were former heads of the FBI. There were no showboating scenes and powerhouses speeches from Mueller in this series - we only ever saw him studiously working in his office. There were reports that the president considered firing Mueller at one point - but Mueller stayed in the background doing his job until the very end of the series. After Season Three ended with the first charges being laid down by Robert Mueller, things really sped up in Season Four.The president's fury with the special counsel investigation increased and he fired his Attorney-General. But the series ended with no charges laid against the president and a sense of victory in the White House. Might we see a spin-off series...? Who was he?OK, he wasn't Putin's chef by this point, but he once was. In Season Four, he was the man accused of spearheading Russia's attempts to interfere in the 2016 election. Key plot lineA little out of the blue, Mueller announced charges against Prigozhin and 12 other Russians, accusing them of tampering with the US election by (among other things) organising and promoting political rallies in the US. In one surreal flashback sequence, we even see the Russians trying to buy a cage large enough to hold an actress dressed as Hillary Clinton in a prison costume. Read more:Seven key takeaways from indictment Who was he?The man who once said he would take a bullet for Donald Trump - but who instead turned against him. Key plot lineCohen, as Trump's long-time personal lawyer, lingered around the edges of the plot for the first three seasons, but became the big player of the fourth. When Mueller's team began looking into Cohen's finances, they passed on their concerns to investigators in New York. Then the plot took an unexpected new turn: Cohen, a long-time Trump loyalist, flipped and began co-operating with investigators. Not only that, but he ended up giving them a lot of help in exchange for a lighter sentence. Cohen ended up admitting violating campaign finance laws, committing tax evasion and lying to Congress. The last shot of the entire series was a mournful Cohen being locked into his jail cell. Who was he?A long-time Washington political operative who acted as an informal adviser to the Trump campaign. He called himself an agent provocateur, and once defended his actions by saying: ""One man's dirty trick is another man's political, civic action."" Key plot lineStone was one of those memorable bit-part characters in Seasons One and Two - a colourful character known for his fiery tongue, sharp suits and the Richard Nixon tattoo spread across his back. Towards the end of Season One, he appeared to let the cat out of the bag, hinting on Twitter that there was damaging information coming out on Hillary Clinton. Soon after, that information (that we later learned was found by Russia) was made public. After a bit of a lull in the middle of Season Four, investigators indicted Stone on seven counts of witness tampering, obstruction and false statements, although he wasn't charged with co-ordinating with Russia. All the way through, he denied any wrongdoing. He, like the president, called the investigation a ""witch-hunt"" and once said the accusations of collusion with Russia were ""a steaming plate of bull"".

"Robert Mugabe was accused of enjoying a lavish lifestyle while presiding over Zimbabwe's economic collapse Nearly $1m (Â£914,000) in cash was stolen from a briefcase belonging to Zimbabwe's former President Robert Mugabe, the state-owned Herald newspaper reports. Three people appeared in court earlier this monthaccused of stealing a suitcase containing $150,000. Butaccording to ""updated court documents"" seen by the Herald, Mr Mugabe says he lost much more,external. Mr Mugabe, now 94, was forced out of office by Zimbabwe's military in 2017. Up to that point, he had been in power for 37 years, first as prime minister and later as president. Once famously claiming that a country could never go bankrupt, he was accused of enjoying a lavish lifestyle while presiding over Zimbabwe's economic collapse. Africa Live: Updates on this and other stories The country where food costs three times your salary Details of the case are emerging at a time when Zimbabwe's dire economy has seen some food prices nearly double in the last week alone. A violent security crackdown on protesters angry at Zimbabwe's high cost of livingforced President Emmerson Mnangagwa to cut short a trip to Europe. The court case is ongoing, but according to the timeline of events taken from court papers and published in the Herald, Mr Mugabe took the money to his rural home in Zvimba in a black briefcase while he was president in 2016. Once there, he allegedly gave the suitcase to Constance Mugabe, a relative who also served as his housekeeper, for safekeeping. The other suspects were employed as cleaners at the time of the theft, which allegedly happened some time between 1 December 2018 and early January 2019. Profile: Robert Mugabe, former President of Zimbabwe In March last year, four months after he had been forced out of office by the military, he reportedly asked for the briefcase, but Constance Mugabe is alleged to have said she did not know of its whereabouts. Mr Mugabe is later alleged to have asked other staff to look for it - and this was when it was found, but with only $78,000 inside, the Herald reports. The suspected thieves allegedly spent the money on cars, homes and animals. ""Johanne Mapurisa bought a Toyota Camry... and a house for $20,000 after the incident,"" state prosecutor Teveraishe Zinyemba told Chinhoyi magistrates court. ""Saymore Nhetekwa also bought a Honda... and livestock which included pigs and cattle for an undisclosed amount."" Since retiring,Mr Mugabe has had difficulty walkingand has spent several months in Singapore for medical treatment. It is unclear if he was at home while the theft took place.

"Jack Shepherd appeared at Tbilisi City Court earlier A man convicted of killing his date in a speedboat crash on the River Thames will be held in a Georgian jail for three months, a judge has ruled. Jack Shepherd's defence team did not challenge the decision to keep him detained before an extradition hearing. He was in hiding in Georgia throughout his trial in the UK for the manslaughter of Charlotte Brown. British Prime Minister Theresa May ""welcomes the news that he is now in custody"". One of Shepherd's defence lawyers told Tbilisi City Court on Friday he should not be extradited because he was warned in a phone call his life might be in danger if he goes to a UK jail. However, the Crown Prosecution Service said it was ""doing everything it can to help make sure Jack Shepherd faces justice through the proper legal channels"". Charlotte Brown, from Clacton-on-Sea, Essex, died after plunging into the icy waters of the River Thames in December 2015 Shepherd told the court he had been working in Georgia, and he greatly regretted going out on the speedboat, adding the accident had left him depressed and suicidal. The 31-year-old had been in the Georgian capital of Tbilisi since March, buthe handed himself into policeon Wednesday. Shepherd told the court: ""Not a single day passes when I don't think about the passing of Charlotte's life and the effect on her family."" He also said he regretted not being at his UK trial. ""I wish I'd sat down with Charlotte's family to explain,"" he said. The court also heard that Shepherd had alcohol dependency and wanted to conduct the appeal against his conviction from Georgia. Shepherd's boat was found to have several defects Shepherd met Ms Brown online and they went on a date on 8 December. Later in the evening he invited her on a speedboat he claimed he owned. The pair were thrown from the boat when it hit branches in the water near Wandsworth Bridge at about midnight. Ms Brown, from Clacton in Essex, was pulled from the water unconscious and unresponsive. A post-mortem examination found she died from cold water immersion. Shepherd made his first appearance at the Old Bailey on 26 January 2018, when he entered a not guilty plea to a charge of manslaughter by gross negligence. He was released on unconditional bail by Judge Richard Marks QC, but failed to show up for his trial and was sentenced to six years in July. Despite being on the run, Shepherd hadwon the right to appeal against his conviction. Shepherd on Wednesday gave an interview to Georgian media proclaiming his innocence Mrs May ""welcomes the news that he is now in custody"", her official spokesman said. ""The government will now work alongside the police and the Crown Prosecution Service to ensure that extradition proceedings are expedited,"" he added. Speedboat killer hands himself in to police Victim was 'my best friend' The speedboat seducer who made a fatal error Shepherd's defence team did not challenge the ruling that he should be kept in custody while his extradition was pending. His lawyer in Georgia, Tariel Kakabadze, said: ""It's Jack Shepherd's decision not to fight for release on today's court session."" Under Georgian law, he can be detained for up to nine months before extradition, he added. Shepherd is also being represented by Mariam Kublashvili, a lawyer who reportedly appeared on Georgia's version of Strictly Come Dancing, who told the BBC her client had been earning money making websites while in Georgia. Meanwhile, it emerged that Shepherd also faces a charge of GBH with intent following an alleged assault on 16 March 2018 in Moretonhampstead in Devon. Shepherd ""was due to have his first appearance in June 2018 but did not turn up and a warrant is live relating to this incident,"" a spokeswoman for the CPS said.

Mauricio Macri told his foreign minister to issue formal requests to Britain and France, according to a statement from his office. The search for the Argentine striker, 28, and pilot David Ibbotson, 59,was called off on Thursday. The plane disappeared from radaras the pair flew over the English Channel on their way to Cardiff on Monday night. In a statement, the president's office said: ""President Mauricio Macri instructed foreign minister Jorge Faurie to make a formal request to the governments of Great Britain and France to ask them to maintain the search efforts."" Mr Faurie is expected to make the request to both nations' embassies. Earlier, Sala's sister Romina said: ""We are convinced Emiliano and the pilot are alive somewhere in the channel."" Speaking through an interpreter, Ms Sala added: ""I'm still in shock. We know Emiliano and the pilot are still alive. We want to go and search for them. ""We're asking please don't stop with this effort. All together, we will find a way to restart the search to find Emiliano."" The Air Accidents Investigation Branch has begun an investigation which will look at ""all operational aspects,"" including licensing and flight plans. Emiliano Sala (left) was on board the plane being flown by pilot David Ibbotson The Piper PA-46 Malibu disappeared over the English Channel with Cardiff City's new signing and Mr Ibbotson on board.

Footballers call for Sala search to resume Transfer window extension request over missing player denied Cardiff to honour Sala with daffodils Timeline of Cardiff City signing from Nantes Mr Ibbotson of Crowle, Lincolnshire, held a private pilot's licence and passed a medical exam as recently as November, according to Federal Aviation Administration records. The Civil Aviation Authority said the aircraft was registered in the US, so fell under its regulations. US law states private pilots cannot make a profit by carrying passengers. Argentine striker Salasigned for the Bluebirds from Nantes on Saturdayand was flying back to Wales from France when the plane disappeared from radar. At 19:15 GMT, Mr Ibbotson made a request to descend before losing contact with Jersey air traffic control. Emiliano Sala was on board a plane bound for Cardiff from Nantes when it disappeared Guernsey's harbour master explained a ""difficult"" decision was made to call off the search on Thursday, saying the chances of survival were ""extremely remote"". Captain David Barker acknowledged the family were ""not content"" with the decision, but was ""absolutely confident"" no more could have been done. He insisted UK coastguard protocols were followed and hoped the families found some comfort in the incident remaining open, despite searches ceasing. A petition launched in Franceto have the search resumed,externalhas gathered more than 67,000 signatures. Sala's former club Nantes, along with many of its players, backed Ms Sala's calls, saying: ""FC Nantes learned searches for the missing plane have been called off. These cannot stop.""

"Vegetarian customers at McDonald's across the UK have reported finding chicken nuggets in meals that are sold as meat-free. The fast-food chain launched its spicy veggie wrap in early January but restaurant staff appear to be struggling with the recipe. Its main ingredient is supposed to be a red pesto vegetarian goujon - customers have been given chicken nuggets instead. It's been happening all over the UK.

Vegetarians have been finding chicken nuggets in their vegetarian wraps as recently as this week, despite flagging the mistake to McDonald's on Twitter throughout January. Rebecca Butcher,external, a 21-year-old YouTuber and social media manager from Yorkshire, says she was aware of the problem before she bought a vegetarian wrap on 22 January. She says it had chicken in it. ""I wanted to wait a little while because I saw people I knew posting that they'd had chicken in their veggie wrap,"" Becca tells Newsbeat. ""I gave it a bit of time so it hopefully wouldn't happen to me. I was kind of shocked that weeks later, they're still getting wrong."" ""I just felt kind of disgusted."" McDonald's has issued an apology to customers who have found meat in their meals. ""We have a number of procedures in place to avoid inaccurate orders,"" it said. ""After we saw that mistakes were being made, we introduced a number of additional measures in our kitchens and communicated with all stores to reduce inaccuracies quickly and effectively. ""We are disappointed that mistakes are still being made. We never want to disappoint customers, and any inaccuracy is not good enough."" Becca tells Newsbeat the experience has made her worried about eating vegetarian food in any restaurant Becca has been a vegetarian for a year and says she quit meat because her dislike for eating animals meant she wasn't eating enough food and became underweight. She says finding meat in her food isn't a surprise for someone who's a veggie. ""As a vegetarian or vegan, you always have to worry about where your food is coming from, who's making it, if they're going to get it right."" ""It's always on your mind when you eat out, because people do get it wrong quite a lot of the time."" After complaining about the wrap with chicken in it (L), her local McDonalds replaced it with the correct filling (R) Becca adds that when she reported the mistake to a manager, she was told it wasn't the first time staff had inadvertently put chicken into a vegetarian meal. She worries that big companies are providing meat-free options because it's fashionable, without realising how important they are to the people who live by them. ""I think companies are now catering to vegetarians and vegans more because they're worried about the backlash if they don't,"" she says. ""Companies are now bringing out vegan food just because it's cool and trendy."" Follow Newsbeat onInstagram,external,Facebook,externalandTwitter,external.

"Jack Shepherd appeared at Tbilisi City Court earlier A man convicted of killing his date in a speedboat crash on the River Thames will be held in a Georgian jail for three months, a judge has ruled. Jack Shepherd's defence team did not challenge the decision to keep him detained before an extradition hearing.

"Robert Mugabe was accused of enjoying a lavish lifestyle while presiding over Zimbabwe's economic collapse Nearly $1m (Â£914,000) in cash was stolen from a briefcase belonging to Zimbabwe's former President Robert Mugabe, the state-owned Herald newspaper reports. Three people appeared in court earlier this monthaccused of stealing a suitcase containing $150,000. Butaccording to ""updated court documents"" seen by the Herald, Mr Mugabe says he lost much more,external. Mr Mugabe, now 94, was forced out of office by Zimbabwe's military in 2017. Up to that point, he had been in power for 37 years, first as prime minister and later as president. Once famously claiming that a country could never go bankrupt, he was accused of enjoying a lavish lifestyle while presiding over Zimbabwe's economic collapse. Africa Live: Updates on this and other stories The country where food costs three times your salary Details of the case are emerging at a time when Zimbabwe's dire economy has seen some food prices nearly double in the last week alone. A violent security crackdown on protesters angry at Zimbabwe's high cost of livingforced President Emmerson Mnangagwa to cut short a trip to Europe. The court case is ongoing, but according to the timeline of events taken from court papers and published in the Herald, Mr Mugabe took the money to his rural home in Zvimba in a black briefcase while he was president in 2016. Once there, he allegedly gave the suitcase to Constance Mugabe, a relative who also served as his housekeeper, for safekeeping. The other suspects were employed as cleaners at the time of the theft, which allegedly happened some time between 1 December 2018 and early January 2019. Profile: Robert Mugabe, former President of Zimbabwe In March last year, four months after he had been forced out of office by the military, he reportedly asked for the briefcase, but Constance Mugabe is alleged to have said she did not know of its whereabouts. Mr Mugabe is later alleged to have asked other staff to look for it - and this was when it was found, but with only $78,000 inside, the Herald reports. The suspected thieves allegedly spent the money on cars, homes and animals. ""Johanne Mapurisa bought a Toyota Camry... and a house for $20,000 after the incident,"" state prosecutor Teveraishe Zinyemba told Chinhoyi magistrates court. ""Saymore Nhetekwa also bought a Honda... and livestock which included pigs and cattle for an undisclosed amount."" Since retiring,Mr Mugabe has had difficulty walkingand has spent several months in Singapore for medical treatment. It is unclear if he was at home while the theft took place.

"This video can not be played Emiliano Sala's sister made an emotional plea for the search for her brother to resume Argentina's president has joined calls for the search for missing Cardiff City footballer Emiliano Sala to resume. Mauricio Macri told his foreign minister to issue formal requests to Britain and France, according to a statement from his office. The search for the Argentine striker, 28, and pilot David Ibbotson, 59,was called off on Thursday. The plane disappeared from radaras the pair flew over the English Channel on their way to Cardiff on Monday night. In a statement, the president's office said: ""President Mauricio Macri instructed foreign minister Jorge Faurie to make a formal request to the governments of Great Britain and France to ask them to maintain the search efforts."" Mr Faurie is expected to make the request to both nations' embassies. Earlier, Sala's sister Romina said: ""We are convinced Emiliano and the pilot are alive somewhere in the channel."" Speaking through an interpreter, Ms Sala added: ""I'm still in shock. We know Emiliano and the pilot are still alive. We want to go and search for them. ""We're asking please don't stop with this effort. All together, we will find a way to restart the search to find Emiliano."" The Air Accidents Investigation Branch has begun an investigation which will look at ""all operational aspects,"" including licensing and flight plans. Emiliano Sala (left) was on board the plane being flown by pilot David Ibbotson The Piper PA-46 Malibu disappeared over the English Channel with Cardiff City's new signing and Mr Ibbotson on board. A ""moment of silent reflection"" for the pair will take place at the next round of Premier League fixtures on Tuesday and Wednesday. Footballers call for Sala search to resume Transfer window extension request over missing player denied Cardiff to honour Sala with daffodils Timeline of Cardiff City signing from Nantes Mr Ibbotson of Crowle, Lincolnshire, held a private pilot's licence and passed a medical exam as recently as November, according to Federal Aviation Administration records. The Civil Aviation Authority said the aircraft was registered in the US, so fell under its regulations. US law states private pilots cannot make a profit by carrying passengers. Argentine striker Salasigned for the Bluebirds from Nantes on Saturdayand was flying back to Wales from France when the plane disappeared from radar. At 19:15 GMT, Mr Ibbotson made a request to descend before losing contact with Jersey air traffic control. Emiliano Sala was on board a plane bound for Cardiff from Nantes when it disappeared Guernsey's harbour master explained a ""difficult"" decision was made to call off the search on Thursday, saying the chances of survival were ""extremely remote"". Captain David Barker acknowledged the family were ""not content"" with the decision, but was ""absolutely confident"" no more could have been done. He insisted UK coastguard protocols were followed and hoped the families found some comfort in the incident remaining open, despite searches ceasing. A petition launched in Franceto have the search resumed,externalhas gathered more than 67,000 signatures. Sala's former club Nantes, along with many of its players, backed Ms Sala's calls, saying: ""FC Nantes learned searches for the missing plane have been called off. These cannot stop."" Tributes have been left outside the Cardiff City Stadium Barcelona star Lionel Messi - a fellow Argentine -posted a message of support for his compatriot on Instagram,external. Three planes and five helicopters racked up 80 hours combined flying time looking for the plane, working alongside two lifeboats and other passing ships. Ms Sala said she held a meeting with investigators, but could not comment about it, and said the family were grateful for all the support they had received. Cardiff City's owner Vincent Tan said: ""Monday evening's news shook everyone at Cardiff City FC to the core. ""We also thank everyone involved with the search and rescue operation, and continue to pray for Emiliano, David Ibbotson and their families."" Chief executive Ken Choo praised Sala as a ""humble man"", adding: ""He's willing to fight and join us [Cardiff City] and help us, so I view him as a hero.""

"Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras hailed the victory in parliament as a ""historic day"" Greece's parliament has voted narrowly to back a historic agreement ending a 27-year dispute over its northern neighbour's name. Parliament in Athens agreed by 153 votes to 146 to approve the name Republic of North Macedonia, despite widespread opposition from the public. ""North Macedonia was born today,"" said Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras. Greece has rejected Macedonia's name since its independence in 1991, as there is a Greek region of that name. Failure to find an appropriate name meant that Greece frustrated Macedonia's drive to join both Nato and the European Union. Opposition to the deal is strongest in the northern Greek region of Macedonia, and polls suggest more than 60% of Greeks dislike it. Thousands of people protested outside parliament on Thursday night, but far smaller numbers braved the torrential rain on Friday as the vote took place. Mr Tsipras, who was involved in negotiating the deal, said it was a ""historic day"". How the 27-year-name row was resolved Clashes over proposed name change Allow Twitter content?

""Congratulations my friend,"" his Macedonian counterpart Zoran Zaev responded on Twitter. ""Together with our peoples we reached a historic victory."" There were warm words from EU officials,external, who praised both countries for setting ""an example of reconciliation for Europe"" by resolving ""one of the most entrenched disputes in the region"". A small group of protesters demonstrated outside as the vote took place The debate in the chamber lasted more than 38 hours, and more than 200 MPs spoke. The centre-right opposition condemned the deal as a ""national defeat"" and members of the far-right Golden Dawn party shouted ""traitors!"" as the vote came to an end. The row has run deep in both countries since Macedonia became a new nation after the collapse of Yugoslavia in 1991. The Macedonia region in Greece includes its second city Thessaloniki. Many Greeks were enraged their northern neighbour had adopted a name that dates back to antiquity - fearing their neighbours had territorial ambitions. This video can not be played There have been a number of violent clashes involving plan protestors The Greek region, which includes the birthplace of Alexander the Great, is considered an intrinsic part of Greek heritage. At the UN, its neighbour became known simply as Fyrom, an acronym for the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, and attempts to resolve the matter foundered for decades. Analysis by Mark Lowen, BBC News, Athens The angry scenes in parliament echoed the fury outside: as one MP spoke of the death threats she'd received in supporting the Macedonia bill, and another shouted ""no to treason"" while he voted, protesters on the steps of parliament screamed ""traitors!"" In the past week, police have fired tear gas here as tens of thousands have demonstrated under the Greek flag, deploring what they saw as their government's capitulation to pressure from Nato and the EU. While outsiders might scratch their heads at the apparent absurdity of this row, Greeks are fiercely attached to their history. ""We've lost everything in the financial crisis - now we're losing our dignity"" is a familiar refrain from those protesting. The right-wing opposition leader, ahead in the polls, says he'll still veto North Macedonia's EU accession when it comes to it - though by the time the small Balkan country is ready to join, passions may have calmed and Greeks will no doubt have other nationalist fish to fry. Mr Tsipras lost his coalition government partner last week and had to survive a no-confidence vote in the run-up to the vote. He had to rely on eight independent and opposition lawmakers to help him get the deal through parliament on Friday. The deal was signed last June by the two countries' prime ministers at Lake Prespa, which has shores in Greece, Macedonia and Albania. It means that Macedonia will now become the Republic of North Macedonia, or North Macedonia for short. Greece's acting Foreign Minister George Katrougalos signed the agreement into Greek law shortly after the vote Macedonia has already ratified the agreement and will inform the United Nations that the accord has been reached. Aside from the name change, the deal carries assurances that there will be no attempt to appropriate the other country's territory. Within a month, a commission will be set up to look at the two countries' history books, to ensure there is an objective interpretation of the past. The Greek prime minister said on Friday that North Macedonia had been born, however it will still take time for the name to be formally declared. Macedonian officials told the BBC that it would only be used when Greece ratified the Nato accession deal, expected within a few weeks. That will take place after Nato ambassadors sign the accession protocol in the coming days. But North Macedonia is likely to become formalised before that, when the government in Skopje tells the UN that both countries have agreed the deal.

"Student protesters had complained that Afrikaans was the language of apartheid A top South African university has dropped Afrikaans as its official language in favour of English. The University of Pretoria told the BBC it needed to ""transform the culture"" to make it ""truly South African"". English is the preferred language of instruction for many in South Africa. Afrikaans language policy has historically been used to exclude black learnersin a country where racism remains deeply embedded 25 years after white-minority rule ended. The word apartheid, which has now been internationalised and is in the Oxford Dictionary, is in fact an Afrikaans word. The language is still spoken by millions, but it is hoped that this move will make the many more millions who do not speak it feel welcomed in one of the best academic institutions in the country. Black and non-Afrikaans-speaking students on Twitter have been discussing the new policy, with many sharing the humiliating and alienating treatment they say they were subjected to at the University of Pretoria. One said that black students were intentionally humiliated by Afrikaans-speaking lecturers. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

When asked about these testimonies, the University of Pretoria's spokesman Rikus Delport told the BBC: ""I'm sure there are incidents of that happening. ""That's what led to the whole coming together, and saying 'let's decide how we go forward'. It flowed from that."" South Africa has 11 official languages - Zulu, Xhosa, Afrikaans, Sepedi, Setswana, English, Sesotho, Xitsonga, Siswati, Tshivenda and Ndebele. Their constitutional recognition came with the advent of democracy, in an attempt to help end institutional racism and heal South Africa's bitter historical divisions. ""In an ideal world we would like all languages to have equal status in teaching, but it's not practically possible or feasible, so not a lot happens in other languages,"" the University of Pretoria's spokesman told the BBC. ""The university will still encourage multilingualism. We'll offer support services to students in their enrolment - where practically possible - in their home language."" Graduations and other official ceremonies will continue to feature the three languages already in use for those occasions - English, Afrikaans and Sepedi. South Africa's top six mother-tongue languages: Zulu:22.7%, Xhosa:16%, Afrikaans:13.5%, English:9.6%, Setswana:8%, Sesotho:7.6% South Africa has 11 official languages altogether English is the most commonly spoken language used officially and in business Source: SA.info/Census 2011 Demand for Afrikaans-language teaching is falling, according to the University of Pretoria, which says 85% of its students came from Afrikaans-speaking households in 1992, dropping to 30% in 2015. Only 18% of students said they wanted classes in Afrikaans at the last count in 2016. ""Afrikaans will be phased out over time,"" the University of Pretoria's spokesman told the BBC. ""Students already in the pipeline will still continue getting their classes in Afrikaans."" English was given equal status to Afrikaans at Stellenbosch University following student campaigns Although the changes came into effect at the start of the year, the university says the decision to switch to English was made back in 2016, prompted by high profile student campaigns across the country like  #AfrikaansMustFall and #FeesMustFall. That wave of protests also led toEnglish being given equal status as Afrikaans at Stellenbosch University,externalin 2017. The pro-Afrikaner civil rights group AfriForum opposed the University of Pretoria's proposed reform at the time, and hasnow accused the university of dishonesty in its changes to languages policy,external. The university denies this. ""They got it wrong. They associated it with [the appointment of] the new vice-chancellor - but I don't know where they got that impression, because the change has been coming for some time"". South Africa's finance minister has also waded into the debate,external, saying people will regret the university's decision to drop Afrikaans in years to come. ""It's obvious there are people who differ from us, who don't agree with it - and we have to accept that,"" the University of Pretoria's spokesman said.

"This video can not be played Roger Stone exited court flashing a Nixonian double-V sign Political strategist Roger Stone, a long-time ally of President Trump, has been arrested in Florida, charged with seven counts in the Mueller probe. Mr Stone, 66, appeared in court in the city of Fort Lauderdale. The indictment includes,externalone count of obstruction of an official proceeding, five counts of false statements, and one count of witness-tampering. The charges are linked to an alleged Russian-led hack into the emails of Democratic Party officials. The information contained in the emails was released by Wikileaks during the 2016 US presidential election campaign. CNN reports that FBI agents arrested Mr Stone in a pre-dawn raid on Friday. One pounded on the door and said, ""FBI, open the door,"" the US cable network says. After news of his old friend's arrest, President Donald Trump slammed the Russia investigation once again on Twitter, calling it the ""Greatest Witch Hunt in the History of our Country!""

Mr Stone appeared in court in Fort Lauderdale The special counsel has accused Mr Stone of attempting to obstruct the investigation into Russian meddling by: Lying to the House Intelligence Committee about what transpired between him and Wikileaks Lying to the committee about records of his interactions with Wikileaks Witness tampering, for trying to keep his Wikileaks intermediary from telling the truth to Congress The indictment does not say Mr Stone committed any criminal activity during the election. He was released on a $250,000 (Â£189,000) bond, but with restrictions allowing him to travel only for court appearances in Florida, Washington DC and New York. After his court appearance, Mr Stone spoke on the phone to conspiracy theorist Alex Jones on his radio programme Infowars. ""I intend to fight for my life,"" Mr Stone said as he launched a fundraiser for his legal battle. ""There's no circumstance under which I would plead guilty to these charges. ""There's no circumstance under which I would bear false witness to the president."" He added: ""Once again, there is no evidence of Russian collusion, Wikileaks collaboration and I'm not charged with doing anything inappropriate or illegal to assist in his [Mr Trump's] election."" Protesters outside chanted ""lock him up"" as Mr Stone exited the courtroom Mr Stone then emerged from court grinning broadly while flashing a Nixonian double V-sign and wearing a blue Ralph Lauren polo shirt. He maintained his innocence though was at times inaudible because of loud boos and chants of ""Lock him up!"" Mr Stone said he would formally plead not guilty to the charges in a Washington DC court next week. He declared himself the target of ""a politically motivated investigation"" and criticised the manner of his arrest. ""At the crack of dawn, 29 FBI agents arrived at my home with 17 vehicles with lights flashing. They terrorised my wife [and] my dogs."" This video can not be played Roger Stone was arrested at home in Fort Lauderdale Hillary Clinton's 2016 campaign chairman John Podesta, who was targeted in the email hack, accused Mr Stone of knowing about it beforehand. More than a month before the emails were made public, Mr Stone tweeted it would soon be Mr Podesta's ""time in a barrel"", which critics say indicates he already knew about the hack. Mr Stone has denied having advance knowledge of the cyber-breach and any knowing contact with Russian agents. On Friday, Mr Podestareferenced the cryptic tweet in a post,externalabout Mr Stone's indictment, noting it was ""Roger's time in the barrel"". Roger Stone is a political lobbyist and an ally of President Donald Trump According to investigators, Mr Stone said he had ""communicated"" with Wikileaks founder Julian Assange before the emails' release and had described the contact as ""perfectly legal"". The indictment accuses the lobbyist of lying to the House Intelligence Committee about what passed between him and Wikileaks, and of falsely claiming not to have records of it. Mr Stone is said to have spoken to senior Trump campaign officials - who are not identified - about ""organization 1"" [believed to be Wikileaks] ""and information it might have had that would be damaging to the Clinton Campaign"". Prosecutors say Mr Stone was also contacted by unnamed ""senior Trump campaign officials"" to inquire about future Wikileaks releases. They also allege he made false statements about his communications with conservative writer and conspiracy theorist Jerome Corsi regarding the Wikileaks email leak. The indictment points to conversations about the planned Wikileaks release to the public between Mr Stone and ""Person 1"" and ""Person 2"", who are not identified by name. Lawyers for Mr Corsi confirmed he is ""Person 1"" in the indictment on Friday, adding that they believe he is not accused of any wrongdoing in the Mueller investigation. Mr Stone has worked on Republican political campaigns since the 1970s His campaign activities have long been under scrutiny by Special Counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating allegations of collusion between Russia and the Trump campaign. In 2016, US intelligence agencies concluded that Russia had tried to turn the election in Mr Trump's favour through state-sponsored cyber-attacks and fake news stories spread on social media. The Mueller investigation has also focused on Mr Stone's communications with Twitter persona Guccifer 2.0, which US intelligence officials say is a front for Russian military intelligence. Mr Trump has repeatedly assailed the Mueller inquiry. The Kremlin has always denied meddling in the US election. Who is Trump confidant Roger Stone? All you need to know about Trump Russia story The president's counsel, Jay Sekulow, said: ""The indictment today does not allege Russian collusion by Roger Stone or anyone else. Rather the indictment focuses on alleged false statements made to Congress"". Tom Perez, chair of the Democratic National Committee, accused the Trump campaign of being ""a willing and active participant in a conspiracy with Russia and Wikileaks"" in a statement. Mr Perez added that ""there are more conspirators yet to be held accountable - and at least one of them is named Donald Trump"". Mr Stone has repeatedly said in interviews that he expected to be indicted. In May he told NBC's Meet the Press: ""It is not inconceivable now that Mr Mueller and his team may seek to conjure up some extraneous crime pertaining to my business, or maybe not even pertaining to the 2016 election."" Through past indictments Robert Mueller has been building the case that Russians were behind the hacking of senior Democratic and Hillary Clinton campaign officials. He alleges they then used Wikileaks to inject damaging information they garnered into the US political bloodstream at a time most harmful to Democrats. What the special counsel's office had yet to allege is that there were any ties between Wikileaks and the Donald Trump presidential campaign. On Friday Mr Mueller charged long-time Trump adviser and confidant Roger Stone with being that missing link, citing communications between Mr Stone and ""senior"" Trump campaign officials before and after the Wikileaks documents were released. The move marks a significant development in this nearly two-year legal drama. For the first time a member of Mr Trump's inner circle, albeit an informal one, is facing charges directly related to Russian election meddling - the central thrust of the special counsel's investigation. Mr Stone has denied suggestions of criminal misconduct. But the man who has boasted of being a master of the political dark arts, and who seemed to crave the notoriety that went along with such claims, now finds himself directly in the centre of a withering legal spotlight. Mr Stone is the 34th person to be charged as part of the Mueller investigation. Those indicted include 12 Russian military officers and 13 Russian nationals accused of leading a campaign to interfere in the US election. Another three Russian entities, including the Internet Research Agency ""troll farm"", have also been charged. Mueller disputes Buzzfeed's Trump report Russia-Trump: Who's who in the drama to end all dramas? Several people connected directly with Mr Trump have been indicted, including his former national security adviser Michael Flynn, and Paul Manafort, the former chairman of his election campaign, who is in jail. Mr Trump's former personal lawyer Michael Cohen and former campaign adviser George Papadopoulos have also been charged. An old friend of Donald Trump, Roger Stone has worked on Republican political campaigns since the 1970s.

"This video can not be played Commons Leader Andrea Leadsom tells Newsnight the EU could grant the UK a âcouple of extra weeksâ to finalise Brexit Andrea Leadsom has said that the EU may be prepared to grant the UK a ""couple of extra weeks"" beyond the 29 March deadline to finalise preparations for Brexit. The Commons leader said that in light of the UK's strong relationship with its ""EU friends"", the UK could be allowed more time for an approved deal to pass all its parliamentary stages. But Ms Leadsom accused the EU of being in denial about the unease in the UK over the Northern Ireland backstop. In a rebuke of Amber Rudd and Philip Hammond, the Commons leader called on the cabinet to rally behind Theresa May and accept that the UK will leave the EU without a deal if MPs reject her deal. EU may move on Brexit deal - Hammond Troops 'could return to Irish border' How many trade agreements has the UK done? In an interview with BBC Newsnight, Ms Leadsom said she had ""grave concerns"" about a bill, proposed by Labour MP Yvette Cooper, which could extend Article 50 by nine months. But she said that the EU could agree to allow the UK to remain in the EU for a few weeks longer than the March deadline. This could happen if a deal has been reached, but more time is needed for parliament to approve its Brexit legislation. A Downing Street spokesman said: ""There is no change to our position. We are not considering an extension to article 50 and are committed to doing whatever it takes to have the statute books ready for when we leave the EU on March 29th this year."" Ms Leadsom, who is in charge of timetabling government business in the Commons, said: ""We can get the legislation through and I think we do, in spite of everything, have a very strong relationship with our EU friends and neighbours and I am absolutely certain that if we needed a couple of extra weeks or something then that would be feasible."" In answer to the suggestion that this would amount to an extension of Article 50, which is due to conclude on 29 March, she said: ""It doesn't necessarily mean that. I think we would want to think carefully about it. But as things stand I do feel that we can get, with the support of both Houses - the House of Commons and the House of Lords - with goodwill and a determination we can still get the legislation through in good time."" In the interview, Ms Leadsom highlighted tensions when she was asked about cabinet discipline, after the warnings from Ms Rudd and Mr Hammond about the dangers of a no deal Brexit. ""I'm totally aligned to the prime minister,"" she said. ""I believe that is where collective responsibility should lie. ""So number one, the legal default is we leave the EU on 29 March without a deal, unless there is a deal in place. That hasn't changed. That is the prime minister's view and that's my view. ""Of course, it is also very important that we continue to prepare for all eventualities because we do need to make sure that in all circumstances the UK can continue to thrive and do well in a post EU environment. ""I do encourage my colleagues in cabinet to get behind that sentiment and to make sure that we are all on the same page. We are now in the really final days."" Ms Leadsom was highly critical of the the EU for failing to understand the deep unease in the UK over the Northern Ireland backstop. In the most contentious area of the deal, the UK and the EU have agreed to avoid a hard border between Northern Ireland and Ireland by binding the former closely to EU rules. This would apply after the transition period if the UK and the EU have failed to negotiate a future relationship by then. ""Keeping the UK in an unlimited, in time terms, backstop that we can't unilaterally exit from under any circumstances is a real problem for many,"" she said. ""Resolve that and [many Conservative MPs and the DUP] can support the prime minister's deal. ""The EU need to be listening very carefully to that. They are slightly in denial saying that that is not the issue. It very much is the issue. ""So I am hoping the European Commissioners will look very closely at the backstop and think of a way through this, because the legal default is that we leave the EU on 29 March without a deal unless we can agree a deal."" Ms Leadsom was speaking to Newsnight during a visit to Manchester to highlight her work chairing a cross-government group on early years intervention.

"This video can not be played Leo Varadkar was speaking to Bloomberg TV Troops could return to the border in the event of a botched Brexit, the Irish prime minister has warned. Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said a hard border could ""involve people in uniform... possibly a police presence, or an army presence to back it up"". Mr Varadkar added that Ireland had been ""victimised"" by the Brexit process. An Irish government spokesperson later said Mr Varadkar was not referring to putting Irish troops at the border, insisting there are no plans to do so. ""The taoiseach made it clear in the interview that the government is determined to avoid a no deal scenario and the consequent risk of a hard border,"" the spokesperson said. ""He was asked to describe a hard border, and gave a description of what it used to look like, and the risk of what it could look like in the worst case scenario. ""He was not referring to Irish personnel and the Irish government has no plans to deploy infrastructure or personnel at the border."" The comments come as the UK chancellor saidthe EU could be ready to drop some of its Brexit ""red lines""to ""help"" save the deal it reached with the UK. Q&A: The Irish border Brexit backstop What would no-deal mean for NI economy? How is Ireland preparing for a no-deal? Prime Minister Theresa May is battling to get her withdrawal deal through Parliament. Many oppose the deal because of its insistence on a backstop for the Irish border. The backstop is effectively an insurance policy to avoid a return to a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, if no other solution can be found through a wider trade deal with the EU. However, the DUP's deputy leader Nigel Dodds called the backstop a ""trap"", saying there were alternative ways to resolve the border issue, although there was a ""need to see a willingness to explore such options"". Speaking to Bloomberg TV at the World Economic Forum in Davos,Mr Varadkar said the backstop was needed to stop the enforcement of visible border,externalbetween Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. At present, goods and services are traded between the two jurisdictions on the island of Ireland with few restrictions. This was secured in the 1998 Good Friday Agreement, which was signed by both the Irish and British governments, as well as political parties in Northern Ireland. Mr Varadkar said the onus was on London to find a solution, adding that Dublin had constantly been asked to compromise on a number of issues. DUP MP Gregory Campbell called the taoiseach's comments about a worst-case scenario as ""deeply unhelpful"". This video can not be played BBC News NI's political reporter Jayne McCormack explains why the border is an issue ""Whilst others focus on trying to move towards a sensible deal, the Irish prime minister needs to dial down the rhetoric and focus on more solutions,"" he added. Mr Varadkar's claims were condemned as ""reckless and irresponsible"" by Sinn FÃ©in president Mary Lou McDonald. ""Today he paints a doomsday scenario of a return of soldiers to the border in the event of a no-deal Brexit,"" she said. ""If that is the case then the only way to prevent such a scenario is by affording the Irish people their say in the form of a border poll on Irish unity."" Following the interview an Irish government spokesperson moved to clarify Mr Varadkar's remarks. ""The taoiseach made it clear in the interview that the government is determined to avoid a no-deal scenario and the consequent risk of a hard border,"" the spokesperson said. ""He was asked to describe a hard border, and gave a description of what it used to look like, and the risk of what it could look like in the worst-case scenario."" On Thursday, Mr Varadkar said the UK would find it ""very difficult"" to do trade deals after Brexitif it has not resolved the Irish border issue. He added that Ireland, by contrast, would continue to benefit from the EU's trade deals. In Westminster, opponents of the backstop fear it will not just be a temporary measure if no future trade deal is agreed. Downing Street says this is one of a range of concerns it is working to address and that it is ""not there yet"" with a new backstop proposal to take to Brussels. The chancellor, Phillip Hammond said, while he does not believe the EU will scrap the backstop, some in the EU were ""looking at what they can do"" to change it to help pass the deal through Westminster. Meanwhile, the Central Bank of Ireland has warned a no-deal Brexit could lead to ""immense"" challenges for the Irish economy. In its first quarterly report of the year,external, it stated that the economy could grow by about 4.5% this year, but that may fall to 1.5% in a no-deal scenario. A ""potentially large depreciation of sterling"" and more expensive food because of tariffs is also predicted. This video can not be played What happens in the event of no deal? The economy is expected to eventually adjust in the long-run. ""Overall, compared to a scenario where the UK remained an EU member, a disorderly Brexit would result in a substantial and permanent loss of output in the Irish economy,"" the report said. ""The disruption and related decline in economic activity would be front-loaded and would mean a significantly more adverse outlook for the Irish economy in 2019 and 2020, compared to the central forecasts in this bulletin."" The Central Bank's report suggests that a ""disorderly Brexit"" would reduce growth in the Irish economy for the next two years. The Central Bank of Ireland uses 88p to the euro as its sterling figure, but says this could slide to 96p-97p in a no-deal Brexit. It warned that the ""deterioration in economic conditions and a more adverse outlook would cause firms and households to cut spending"". Please upgrade your browser It said imports would be affected due to disruption of production processes, and that households would also be affected through the price and availability of consumer goods. ""Exports would fall due to an immediate demand and large reduction in demand from the UK and the fall in sterling.""

"Donald Trump has been dogged by suspicion over his ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin For nearly two years the Trump-Russia affair has dominated front pages and mired the president's administration in conflict and controversy. But what is it exactly? How did it begin? And what did it find out? The inquiry, led by widely respected former director of the FBI Robert Mueller, focused on alleged collusion between Mr Trump's 2016 presidential campaign team and Moscow. The report stated that no evidence of a conspiracy was found, but it did lay out 10 instances where the president possibly obstructed justice. Mr Mueller has said his report did not exonerate the president, but that charging a sitting president was not an option. Here's a breakdown on one of the most high-profile political inquiries in US history. Mr Trump's campaign and transition teams were accused of conspiring with Russian agents to influence the US election in the then Republican candidate's favour. US intelligence agencies concluded in 2016 that Russia was behind an effort to tip the scales of the US election against Hillary Clinton, with a state-authorised campaign of cyber attacks and fake news stories planted on social media. Both the Russian and US presidents had poured scorn on suggestions of ""collusion"", with Mr Trump calling it ""the greatest political witch hunt in history"". At least 17 Trump associates had contacts with Russians or Wikileaks, which released hacked documents, during the campaign or transition, according toan analysis of public records by the New York Times,external, with at least 100 face-to-face interactions, phone calls or electronic messages with Russians or Kremlin-linked figures and at least 51 individual communications. Trump aides known to have had contact with Russians include the president's son-in-law and adviser Jared Kushner, his son Donald Trump Jr, former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn, Attorney General Jeff Sessions and former personal lawyer Michael Cohen. Who's who in the drama to end all dramas? The president's supporters point out that interactions with foreign nationals are routine during any White House campaign, but three Trump associates have now admitted lying about these encounters. The special counsel has indicted more than 30 people, including four members of Mr Trump's campaign team or administration, an adviser and long-time ally, and 26 Russians, as well as three Russian companies. A former prosecutor, Mr Mueller went on to become the second-longest serving FBI director in history, after J Edgar Hoover. His Senate confirmation vote as FBI director went 98-0 in his favour. A special Senate vote to extend his term beyond the usual 10 years to 12 passed 100-0. With a team of experienced lawyers drawn from private practice and from the Department of Justice, as well as FBI officers, Mr Mueller worked quietly from an unassuming building in south-west Washington, not issuing any public comment during the investigation. What is a special counsel? America's most mysterious public figure On 22 March, he submitted his report to Attorney General William Barr, who replaced Jeff Sessions after he was forced to resign. The448-page report,externalpainted a mixed picture of the president's conduct. While it did not establish that the Trump campaign criminally conspired with Russia to meddle in the election, it built an extensive obstruction-of-justice case against the president. Mr Mueller said the report did not exonerate the president but stopped short of saying Mr Trump committed a crime. Eight new things in the Mueller report ""If we had confidence after a thorough investigation of the facts that the president clearly did not commit obstruction of justice, we would so state,"" the report says. ""Based on the facts and the applicable legal standards, we are unable to reach that judgement. Accordingly, while this report does not conclude that the president committed a crime, it also does not exonerate him."" It also revealed Mr Trump instructed a White House lawyer to try and remove Mr Mueller over alleged ""conflicts of interest"", but the lawyer resigned. Around 10% of the public report is redacted. As well as the special counsel inquiry by Mr Mueller under the aegis of the justice department there have been four congressional investigations: The Senate and House Intelligence Committees and the Senate Judiciary Committee are investigating alleged Kremlin meddling and any collusion with Trump aides The House Oversight Committee is scrutinising links between Trump associates and Russian officials The Judiciary Committee has issued more than 80 document requests in a broad probe that goes beyond alleged contacts between the campaign and Moscow Meanwhile federal prosecutors at the Southern District of New York and in Washington are looking at other areas related to Russia All of the House inquiries were plagued by political squabbling amongst lawmakers, and closed without leading to any charges or claims of Russian collusion. Democrats have reopened the investigations after gaining a majority in the House in January. The Senate committee has yet to release its findings. Before the redacted report was released, Mr Barr, who was attorney general under the late George HW Bush between 1991 and 1993, spent two days poring over Mr Mueller's report beforeissuing his interpretation to Congress. There was a lot of speculation that an obstruction of justice legal case against the president could be considered. One of the possibilities raised was that it could look into Mr Trump's sacking of James Comey as head of the FBI. But legal experts had warned that the charge carried a fairly high threshold - proof of ""corrupt intent"". In his summary, Mr Barr says, quoting Mr Mueller's report: ""The special counsel states that 'while this report does not conclude that the president committed a crime, it also does not exonerate him'."" Mr Barr then says that, after consulting Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, there was insufficient evidence ""to establish that the president committed an obstruction-of-justice offence"". Mr Mueller gave a rare statement in May about the investigation, and announced his office was officially shutting down. His statement largely reaffirmed what was in the report released with redactions last month. He said if his team had had confidence that Mr Trump ""clearly did not commit a crime, we would have said so"". Mr Mueller added that ""the Constitution requires a process other than the criminal justice system to formally accuse a sitting president of wrongdoing,"" in what was seen as a reference to the ability of Congress to start an impeachment process. The special counsel said he did not believe it was ""appropriate to speak further"" about the investigation and that he would not provide any information that was not in his team's report. But the end of the special counsel investigation does not mark the end of the story. The former FBI director will face questions from two congressional committees about his report on the Donald Trump campaign and Russia. The congressional probes could stretch into 2020 and several of the prosecutions Mr Mueller initiated could be continued by lawyers within the Department of Justice. This video can not be played What to expect from Mueller hearings Mr Barr has said that it is his objective to get as much information to Congress and the public as possible, consistent with prosecutorial guidelines and confidentiality requirements. Democrats in Congress have called for whatever information Mr Mueller produces to be released publicly in its entirety. Back in February 2017, before Mr Mueller was appointed as special counsel, the FBI was investigating Michael Flynn over his contacts with Russian officials. Then-head of the FBI, Mr Comey, attended a briefing in the Oval Office at the White House, along with Vice-President Mike Pence and Mr Sessions. According to a detailed account of the meeting written by Mr Comey immediately afterwards, the president asked Mr Pence and Mr Sessions to leave the room before suggesting Mr Comey end the Flynn investigation. The FBI director's notes quote the president as saying: ""I hope you can see your way clear to letting this go, to letting Flynn go. He is a good guy. I hope you can let this go."" Mr Comey prepared memos from his notes and shared them with other senior FBI officials, saying he was concerned about the nature of the meeting. A few months later, in May, the president sacked Mr Comey, citing ""this Russia thing"", a move that shocked Washington and led to talk of a cover-up. Part of the inquiry focuses on a June 2016 meeting at Trump Tower in New York City involving Mr Trump's son, Donald Jr, his son-in-law Jared Kushner, then-campaign chairman Paul Manafort and an influential Russian lawyer, Natalia Veselnitskaya. The meeting occurred after a Russian intermediary contacted Mr Trump Jr with a promise to provide material that would ""incriminate"" Hillary Clinton - the Democratic candidate - and be ""very useful to your father"". It was part of the Russian government's ""support"" for Mr Trump, he noted. Mr Trump Jr replied: ""I love it."" Mr Trump Jr later defended the meeting, saying Ms Veselnitskaya offered only ""inane nonsense"" and nothing came of it, but he also told Fox News' Sean Hannity ""in retrospect, I probably would have done things a little differently"". In an initial statement to explain the meeting one year after it occurred, Mr Trump Jr claimed that it had been held to discuss Russian adoptions. But in a follow-up statement he said that the actual purpose had been about political opposition research. In June 2018 Mr Trump tweeted that the meeting was ""to get information on an opponent, totally legal and done all the time in politics"". President Trump's lawyers say he dictated his son's first misleading explanation, leading to questions of whether the president sought to obstruct a Department of Justice inquiry. See our fullRussia timeline. The arrest of Mr Stone, a long-time adviser and close confidant to Mr Trump, marks a significant development in this legal drama. The charges against him are linked to an alleged Russian-led hack into the emails of Democratic Party officials. Mr Stone denies suggestions of criminal misconduct. The information contained in the emails was released by Wikileaks during the 2016 US presidential election campaign. Stone: Trump ally, political strategist and Nixon fan It means that, for the first time, a member of Mr Trump's inner circle is facing charges directly related to Russian election meddling. Mr Papadopoulos's role in the drama begins with a May 2016 drink in a London bar with an Australian diplomat. He told the envoy that Russia had ""political dirt"" on Hillary Clinton - a conversation which was later reported by Australian authorities to the FBI and may have prompted the bureau's investigation into the campaign. In late October 2017, court documents emerged showing Mr Papadopoulos had pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about the timing of meetings with alleged go-betweens for Russia. He falsely claimed he had met two figures with Russian connections before joining the Trump campaign in March 2016. In fact, he met them after joining the campaign. After lying to the FBI, he deleted an incriminating Facebook account and destroyed a phone. Emails reveal that he communicated with high-level figures in the Trump campaign. He was pictured in March 2016 seated at a foreign policy meeting with Mr Trump, Jeff Sessions and others, in a photo Mr Trump shared on Twitter. Just before he began a two-week sentence in a Wisconsin prison in late November 2018 however, he sent a tweet saying he had ""never met a single Russian official"". On his release, he announced he was publishing a book entitled ""Deep State Target: How I got caught in the crosshairs of the plot to bring down President Trump"". In January 2017, a secret dossier was leaked to the press. It had been compiled by a former British intelligence official and Russia expert, Christopher Steele, who had been paid to investigate Mr Trump's ties to Russia. The dossier alleged Moscow had compromising material on Mr Trump, including claims he was once recorded with prostitutes at a Moscow hotel during a 2013 trip for one of his Miss Universe pageants. Mr Trump emphatically denies this. The file purported to show financial and personal links between Mr Trump, his advisers and Moscow. It also suggested the Kremlin had cultivated Mr Trump for years before he ran for president. Mr Trump dismissed the dossier, arguing its contents were based largely on unnamed sources. It was later reported that Mr Steele's report was funded as opposition research by the Clinton campaign and Democratic National Committee. Fusion GPS, the Washington-based firm that was hired to commission the dossier, had previously been paid via a conservative website to dig up dirt on Mr Trump. It didn't, exactly. Hacking voter machines, and rigging elections generally, is very, very difficult. Hacking people? That would be easier. The special counsel charges show that Russia effectively ran a two-pronged operation. The first prong in mid-2016 allegedly involved sending rafts of so-called ""phishing"" emails to figures in the Democratic Party - an unsophisticated method used by everyone from state-sponsored actors to low-level scammers for duping people into giving up their passwords. Hackers gained access to the Democratic National Committee's systems and the personal email of Clinton campaign chair John Podesta. They leaked tens of thousands of emails revealing the inner workings of the Clinton campaign and the party's operations, along with mundane, embarrassing details. The second prong allegedly involved flooding social media networks, especially Facebook, with bogus stories designed to smear the Democrats and undermine the Clinton campaign. According to testimony by Facebook before Congress, Russia-backed content reached as many as 126 million Americans on the social network during and after election. In August 2016, an envelope arrived at the White House marked for the eyes of President Barack Obama and three senior aides. According to theWashington Post,external, the envelope had come by courier from the CIA, and contained a bombshell revelation - Mr Putin was directing a state-sponsored effort to interfere with the US election. The FBI was already looking at ties between the Trump campaign and Russia, but the CIA memo seemed to confirm Russian efforts to throw the election Mr Trump's way. According to reporting in the Post and elsewhere, the Obama administration agonised over whether to divulge the alleged operations. Reportedly fearful of appearing to attempt to interfere politically, they stayed relatively quiet. Other intelligence agencies were slow in reaching the same conclusion as the CIA, and congressional Republicans were reluctant to offer support to a public condemnation of Moscow. Warnings were issued to Russian officials, but it wasn't until the main US intelligence agencies agreed, in late September, that President Obama directed them to make a public statement. To avoid appearing partisan, the statement would not carry his name. The president is celebrating the findings of the special counsel's report revealed by Mr Barr, but there are a variety of ongoing investigations into Mr Trump's conduct and that of his businesses. Several of them pose a legitimate threat to the president, both legal and political. However, it is effectively impossible to bring criminal charges against a sitting president, and any case would have to be brought by the executive branch, of which Mr Trump is the boss. This video can not be played What does it take to impeach a president? As for impeachment, it remains unlikely at this stage. A majority in the House of Representatives is first required to approve an article of impeachment, and the Democratic leaders in that chamber appear reluctant to make such a move until the multiple investigations are concluded. In the event of a successful House vote, the Senate holds a trial presided over by the Supreme Court chief justice, and a two-thirds majority vote is required in the Senate to convict the president. That's a high bar - two presidents, Bill Clinton and Andrew Johnson, have been acquitted at this stage. With a Republican majority in the 100-seat Senate, at least 19 members of Mr Trump's own party would have to break ranks to remove him from office.

"This video can not be played David Solomon warns of Brexit investment hit The new chief executive of Goldman Sachs says that a ""difficult"" Brexit will negatively affect its investment plans in the UK. David Solomon told the BBC that while there has been a frozen headcount in the UK, the bank has been adding staff in the EU over the last two years. The outcome of Brexit would affect decisions about Goldman's people and resources, he said. The Wall Street giant employs 6,000 people in the UK. Speaking at the World Economic Forum, in Davos, Mr Solomon said: ""If this [Brexit] is resolved in a difficult way, or in a hard way, I do think it'll have an impact on where we invest in where we put people. ""All these things ultimately have an impact on the investment decisions and the business decisions that all of us as business leaders make."" Full coverage of Davos 2019,external 'Significant disruption' from no deal Of Goldman's UK staff, a few - in the dozens - have been asked to move to locations elsewhere in Europe. However, the bank has added hundreds of staff to offices in Frankfurt, Paris, Stockholm, Milan and Madrid. Please upgrade your browser While Brexit is a concern for the bank, it is not top of its list of worries. That spot goes to the fraught relationship between the world's two largest economies - the US and China. While some see the US as the aggressor in the trade war with China, Mr Solomon has sympathy with Donald Trump's ambitions to reset the rules. ""I think the administration has it right. I think there have been imbalances in the way the US and China have dealt with each other, particularly the openness of China's had with respect to US business. ""We want to see a level playing field and we want to see our technology and our investment over a long period of time protected,"" Mr Solomon told the BBC. He said he hoped that the US and China could resolve their differences by March - the date that the US is planning to introduce a new wave of higher tariffs on imports from China. Mr Solomon speaks for many at this year's World Economic Forum. The chatter in the congress hall, the receptions and the restaurants, is focused on the US and China, and whether the trade tensions between the economic superpowers could tip the world into a serious slowdown. The Goldman boss said he didn't think a global recession was imminent, but he said there was a 15% chance of a downturn in the US this year, and a 50% chance next year. Neither Mr Solomon, nor anyone else in Davos, is prepared to make such a precise estimate of the chances of the no deal Brexit that most businesses here fear. But it is certainly fair to say that he and most business leaders in Davos think it's becoming less likely.

Mauricio Macri told his foreign minister to issue formal requests to Britain and France, according to a statement from his office. The search for the Argentine striker, 28, and pilot David Ibbotson, 59,was called off on Thursday. The plane disappeared from radaras the pair flew over the English Channel on their way to Cardiff on Monday night. In a statement, the president's office said: ""President Mauricio Macri instructed foreign minister Jorge Faurie to make a formal request to the governments of Great Britain and France to ask them to maintain the search efforts."" Mr Faurie is expected to make the request to both nations' embassies. Earlier, Sala's sister Romina said: ""We are convinced Emiliano and the pilot are alive somewhere in the channel."" Speaking through an interpreter, Ms Sala added: ""I'm still in shock. We know Emiliano and the pilot are still alive. We want to go and search for them. ""We're asking please don't stop with this effort. All together, we will find a way to restart the search to find Emiliano."" The Air Accidents Investigation Branch has begun an investigation which will look at ""all operational aspects,"" including licensing and flight plans. Emiliano Sala (left) was on board the plane being flown by pilot David Ibbotson The Piper PA-46 Malibu disappeared over the English Channel with Cardiff City's new signing and Mr Ibbotson on board. A ""moment of silent reflection"" for the pair will take place at the next round of Premier League fixtures on Tuesday and Wednesday. Footballers call for Sala search to resume Transfer window extension request over missing player denied Cardiff to honour Sala with daffodils Timeline of Cardiff City signing from Nantes Mr Ibbotson of Crowle, Lincolnshire, held a private pilot's licence and passed a medical exam as recently as November, according to Federal Aviation Administration records. The Civil Aviation Authority said the aircraft was registered in the US, so fell under its regulations. US law states private pilots cannot make a profit by carrying passengers. Argentine striker Salasigned for the Bluebirds from Nantes on Saturdayand was flying back to Wales from France when the plane disappeared from radar. At 19:15 GMT, Mr Ibbotson made a request to descend before losing contact with Jersey air traffic control. Emiliano Sala was on board a plane bound for Cardiff from Nantes when it disappeared Guernsey's harbour master explained a ""difficult"" decision was made to call off the search on Thursday, saying the chances of survival were ""extremely remote"". Captain David Barker acknowledged the family were ""not content"" with the decision, but was ""absolutely confident"" no more could have been done. He insisted UK coastguard protocols were followed and hoped the families found some comfort in the incident remaining open, despite searches ceasing. A petition launched in Franceto have the search resumed,externalhas gathered more than 67,000 signatures. Sala's former club Nantes, along with many of its players, backed Ms Sala's calls, saying: ""FC Nantes learned searches for the missing plane have been called off. These cannot stop."" Tributes have been left outside the Cardiff City Stadium Barcelona star Lionel Messi - a fellow Argentine -posted a message of support for his compatriot on Instagram,external. Three planes and five helicopters racked up 80 hours combined flying time looking for the plane, working alongside two lifeboats and other passing ships. Ms Sala said she held a meeting with investigators, but could not comment about it, and said the family were grateful for all the support they had received. Cardiff City's owner Vincent Tan said: ""Monday evening's news shook everyone at Cardiff City FC to the core.

The PA-46-310P Malibu aircraft Sala and Mr Ibbotson were on board There were ""alarm bells all around"" the incident, aviation consultant Alastair Rosenchein told BBC Radio Wales'Good Morning Walesprogramme. He said: ""The one issue is whether a single-engine air craft should be flying at night, in winter, over water and with passengers. This is the real issue - it is a really bad combination."" He said despite only 1,400 of the planes being built, there was a ""quite significant"" number of deaths and injuries from flights involving them.

"A family has come forward to say they believe the woman found in the stream is their missing relative A Thai family believe a woman who is thought to have been murdered and then dumped in a mountain stream in England is their missing relative. The body was found by walkers wrapped around rocks near Pen-y-ghent in the Yorkshire Dales in 2004. Her identity has never been established by North Yorkshire Police but officers think she was a murdered ""Thai bride"". A press conference in north-east Thailand heard a family had come forward about a missing relative. The Udon Thani Provincial Justice Office was told the woman, who the BBC is not naming for legal reasons, married a British man in 1991 and moved to the north-west of England four years later. Her mother told the Thai Women's Network (TWN), which organised Thursday's press conference, she had not heard from her daughter since 2004. Reporters were shown photographs of the missing woman alongside an artist's impression of the murder victim that was released by police in Britain. The TWN said it had passed on the details of the missing woman, including her name and that of her husband, to North Yorkshire Police, which is investigating the latest development. When walker Richard Hill posed for this picture, he did not realise a body was wrapped around the rocks behind him Cold-case investigators believe the body found in the UK was that of a woman aged between 25 and 35 who was originally from south-east Asia. Forensic tests on samples of her hair led detectives to think she had been living in a rural community in north Lancashire or south Cumbria. She was found more than a mile (2km) from the nearest road and was wearing only green jeans, socks and a gold wedding band. A North Yorkshire Police spokesman confirmed the force's Cold Case Review Unit had received a possible name for the unknown woman. Inquiries were ongoing to establish her identity, he added. A funeral for the unknown woman was held at St Oswald's Parish Church on 5 September 2007 The local quarry donated a slab of limestone for the woman's headstone (pictured centre right) which read ""The Lady of the Hills"" As no-one came forward to identify the woman after her body was found, the parish council for Horton in Ribblesdale organised her funeral in 2007. Officials said the village felt ""responsibility"" towards her, and wanted her to have a final resting place ""should her family ever get traced"". More than 40 people attended the funeral in the village graveyard. The headstone bears the title given to the woman by local people - ""The Lady of the Hills"".

"This video can not be played What happens in the event of no deal? Some EU countries are pushing for the European Union's no-deal legislation to be more generous to the UK. The European Commission has proposed ""bare bones"" arrangements on aviation and road haulage if there is no deal. The legislation would allow British truckers to carry goods into the EU and British airlines to fly in and out of the EU, from 29 March to 31 December. But a group of countries want to give UK hauliers the right to operate within the EU as well, known as cabotage. Some also want British airlines to be able to offer connecting flights within the EU. Diplomats are also concerned that airlines will not be able to offer new routes or run more services because the number of flights would be capped at 2018 levels. Queen makes plea for 'common ground' Rudd 'committed to avoiding no deal' How would no deal affect UK citizens in the EU? Brexit: A simple guide Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, France's Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said: ""You can't be out of the EU and be getting the benefits of the single market."" ""That is the clear red line of France."" The issues were discussed at a meeting of member states' ambassadors in Brussels on Wednesday. Officials will try to hammer out a compromise at a meeting on Friday and ambassadors will discuss it again next week. ""We've got to strike a balance between being prepared but not sending the message to the UK that no deal would be OK,"" a diplomat said. The European Commission, which co-ordinates planning for no deal at a European level, is opposed to expanding the scope of the legislation, saying it would give the UK some of the benefits of membership of the single market. Please upgrade your browser The commission also urged member states not to engage in bilateral deals with the UK, which some countries have suggested, because much of the responsibility for these issues rests with national governments. Details of the discussion are contained in a diplomatic note of a meeting of EU ambassadors on Wednesday. At least one country asked whether the EU should consider additional contingency measures to guarantee co-operation on security issues, such as the Schengen Information System which is used to share information about stolen goods and people of interest. The news will cheer supporters of a no-deal Brexit, who argue that the EU would be prepared to offer mini-deals with the UK if the withdrawal agreement it has negotiated with the UK is not approved.

"Angel sharks caught off the Wales coast in the 60s and 70s Scientists have found evidence that one of the world's rarest sharks is alive and well, living off the Welsh coast. Sightings from fishing boats suggest the mysterious angel shark is present in Welsh waters, although no-one knows exactly where. The shark's only established stronghold is the Canary Islands, where the animals have been filmed on the seabed. Wales could be a key habitat for the critically endangered shark, which is from an ancient and unique family. This video can not be played ""If we lose the angel shark we lose a really important lineage of evolutionary history"" ""If we lose the angel shark, we lose a really important lineage of evolutionary history that we can't get from any other shark species,"" Joanna Barker, of the Zoological Society of London (ZSL), told BBC News. ""Flat sharks"" that spend much of the time camouflaged in the sediments on the seabed, where they lie in wait for fish Once common across the east Atlantic and Mediterranean seas, historic records suggest the Welsh coast may be an important habitat Angel sharks have declined across their range because of a number of threats, including habitat disturbance, pollution and accidental fishing catch Ms Barker, who is a marine biologist, studied the shark off the Canary Islands. On her return, she stumbled upon a book in the ZSL library, describing the presence of the angel shark in Wales 100 years ago. She was determined to find out more about the shark and started a project with colleagues atCyfoeth Naturiol Cymru - Natural Resources Wales.,external Photo taken off Aberdovey in the 70s-80s After appealing for information from fishers and the local community, intriguing photographs came to light. The shark was clearly a prize catch in the 1970s and 1980s, before it became a protected species. Fossil shark named after 80s video game Sharks on the edge of existence Divers swim with one of biggest great white sharks off Hawaii World's strangest sharks and rays 'on brink of extinction' Sightings were made recently off Cardigan Bay, in the Bristol Channel and to the north of Holyhead, she said. ""What we really want to try and understand is what sort of numbers are we talking about and where are their important habitats, because there could be some really critical areas for angel sharks in Wales,"" she added. The shark lurks on the ocean floor A big question is whether the angel sharks are moving back and forth between Wales, the Canary Islands, or elsewhere, and whether they are distinct populations. Genetic research using swabs taken from a shark's skin could give the answer, say scientists. Dives are planned for later in the year, to look for direct evidence of angel sharks. Meanwhile, roadshows have been set up to gather more pictures and memories. Pwllheli beach, Wales: Possible haven to the angel shark?

"Fuller's, the brewer whose beers include London Pride, is to sell its entire drinks business to Japan's biggest brewer Asahi. The company said the Â£250m deal,externalwould preserve the Griffin Brewery in Chiswick, west London, where beer has been brewed since 1654. Fuller's will now focus on its hotels and pubs business, which generates most of its profits. Asahi is the owner of the Peroni and Grolsch brands. Fuller's said the deal - which also includes cider and soft drinks brand Cornish Orchards and craft cask brewer Dark Star - was due to ""structural changes to the beer industry"". As a mid-sized brewer, the company said it was being squeezed between the global brewers and the 2,000 smaller brewers across the UK. The Campaign for Real Ale (Camra) said it was a ""sad day"" for the industry. Fuller's is forming an alliance with Asahi to enable its pubs and hotels to continue to sell the beers and ciders. Simon Emeny, chief executive of Fuller's, said: ""The deal secures the future of both part of our business including protecting the heritage of the Griffin Brewery in Chiswick, which was particularly important to the Fuller's board"". While the Griffin Brewery dates back to the era of Oliver Cromwell, the business - full name Fuller, Smith & Turner - was formally created in 1845. Mr Emeny is the first chief executive of the business not to have come from one of the founding families, taking over in 2013. Just over 50% of the shares are still owned by descendents of the founding families. Neil Wilson, chief markets analyst at Markets.com, said: ""Punters won't notice much difference at the bar. Pubs may be closing at a hell of a clip these days but consumers still want experiences and dining out is one of those. ""Therefore investing in pubs and hotels is essential as consumers demand more from their pub experience."" Can pubs stand many more Dry Januarys? He said the deal was well timed because of the fall in the pound. ""Right now with the pound still very undervalued it looks to be a good time to swoop. The Japanese firm has been gobbling up brewers across Europe and elsewhere on major buying spree."" By Katie Prescott, BBC Radio 4 Today business presenter Like the ravens leaving the Tower of London is how one commentator described the sale of London Pride to Asahi. But while there may be an emotional significance, drinkers are unlikely to notice a change to the branding or formula in the pub. The two companies have signed a long-term strategic alliance and Asahi has committed to supporting the UK breweries behind Fuller's brands. Fuller's plans to focus its attention on its pubs and hotels where it makes 87% of its profits. It says that tax breaks given to microbrewers and the power of the big global drinks firms has left little space at the bar for those in the middle. It's giving some of the proceeds to shareholders and its pension fund, and with a 22% rise in its share price this morning investors are certainly clinking glasses at the deal. Asahi has already expanded in Europe by buying the Peroni, Grolsch, Meantime and Pilsner Urquell brands. Akiyoshi Koji, chief executive of Asahi, said the Fuller's brands would complement its existing brands in the UK. ""In particular, London Pride is a fantastic brand with a illustrious heritage dating back to the 1950s"". Asahi will continue to brew at the Griffin Brewery and is already a supplier to Fuller's hotels and 400 or so managed and tenanted pubs in London and the South East. The new owners will continue to brew beer at the Griffin Brewery in west London Jackie Parker, chair  of Camra, said she was concerned that consolidation was ""seldom beneficial for consumers"". ""Fuller's has been a family brewer in Britain for more than a hundred years, and it's a very sad day to see such a well-known, historic and respected name exit the brewing business. ""While the Fuller's family has stressed it has sought to protect the heritage of the Griffin Brewery, we'd call on the new owners to pledge to continue brewing operations at the Chiswick site."" Fuller's also issued a trading update, which Mr Emeny described as ""very good"", adding he was ""particularly pleased"" with sales at its managed pubs and hotels over the key Christmas and New Year period. Like-for-like sales - which strip out new openings - at its managed pubs and hotels rose by 4.7% over the 42 weeks to 19 January, whereas beer and cider volumes were flat.

"The Queen visits the Sandringham branch of the WI each year during her winter stay at the nearby Royal estate The Queen has urged people to find ""common ground"" and to respect ""different points of view"". Commentators say the remarks will be seen as referring to the Brexit debate, with MPs due to vote on the PM's deal for leaving the EU again next week. MPs rejected the deal last week but the UK will leave on 29 March with no deal unless they can agree on a way forward. BBC royal correspondent Nicholas Witchell said there was little doubt the Queen was ""sending a message"". Queen shows off 'silky Pointless skills' Brexit: A really simple guide Fresh referendum 'doesn't have MP numbers' ""It is impossible to imagine that the head of state would use a construction of words such as this without it being appreciated that they would be seen as a reference to the current political debate,"" he said. Her words echoedthe theme of her Christmas broadcast, our correspondent added. Chancellor Philip Hammond said there was ""huge wisdom"" in the Queen's remarks. He told Radio 4's Today programme: ""I don't think anybody will be at all surprised to hear the Queen advocating the view that in all things controversial we should seek compromise, we should seek common ground, we should seek a way forward."" The Queen also received praise from other cabinet ministers - including Work and Pensions Secretary Amber Rudd, who called them ""wise words"". 'The bed that saved me from the Taliban' Bulger mother 'disgusted' by Oscar nomination Nurse held after patient gives birth Theresa May's official spokesman declined to comment directly on the Queen's remarks. He said: ""The prime minister's own view is that we should always show great respect for the point of view of others."" Analysis by BBC royal correspondent Jonny Dymond Twice now in the space of five or so weeks the Queen has dipped a rhetorical toe in the raging waters of the Brexit debate. Neither time has she mentioned the word that has driven the country either to apoplexy or to catatonic boredom. Each time it's been crystal clear as to what she is talking about. Some may be surprised. Isn't the Queen supposed to be above politics? Not really. Her role is more than just ceremonial. She is the head of state. Her weekly audiences with prime ministers are taken seriously by both sides. A constant flow of red boxes full of state papers means she is one of the best briefed in the land. She certainly isn't meant to be party political. But she has a political role. It is one that she has exercised very sparingly - if anything she has been a conservative Queen, pulling back from any intervention that might seem to involve the Monarchy in controversy or leave it open to accusations of political favouritism. But when the unity of the United Kingdom or the Commonwealth has been under threat she has acted.Her call before the Scottish referendum in 2014for voters to 'think very carefully' was long mulled and scrupulously scripted. Now, with the air full of vitriol, and accusations of treachery and betrayal hurled hither and thither, she has spoken again to try and calm a fevered nation. It is both her right, and her duty. The Queen, as head of state, remains neutral on political matters and does not usually express her views on contentious issues. However, speaking at an event to mark the 100 years of Sandringham Women's Institute in Norfolk, the Queen said: ""The continued emphasis on patience, friendship, a strong community focus, and considering the needs of others, are as important today as they were when the group was founded all those years ago. ""Of course, every generation faces fresh challenges and opportunities. ""As we look for new answers in the modern age, I for one prefer the tried and tested recipes, like speaking well of each other and respecting different points of view; coming together to seek out the common ground; and never losing sight of the bigger picture."" She said these approaches were ""timeless, and I commend them to everyone"". The Queen's appeal for common ground touched on the same issues as her Christmas message, in which she urged people to treat others with respect ""even with the most deeply held differences"". Historian Lord Hennessy said the Queen's second intervention within a month meant it was ""of immense significance"". He added: ""It's constitutionally impeccable as she always is, because her intervention is behavioural not political. It's about courtesy and civility and not policy.""

"This video can not be played Hugh McIlvanney worked as a journalist for 60 years Hugh McIlvanney, widely considered to be one of Britain's greatest sports journalists, has died at the age of 84. Mr McIlvanney, who was born in Kilmarnock, worked for the Observer and then the Sunday Times, covering some of the most significant sporting events of his age. These included the fight in 1974 between Muhammad Ali and George Foreman known as the Rumble in the Jungle. He retired in 2016 after 60 years as a journalist. BBC Radio 4 - McIlvanney, Ferguson and a game of Trivial Pursuit The brothers who wrote their way to fame Hugh McIlvanney: A life in sport BBC Radio Scotland - The McIlvanney Conversations Mr McIlvanney was inducted into both the International Boxing Hall of Fame (2009) and the Scottish Football Hall of Fame (2011). His career began on his local newspaper before spells on The Scotsman and The Daily Express led to him working at The Observer and eventually The Sunday Times. He went on to forge close working and personal relationships with, perhaps, the four finest football managers to emerge from Scotland - Jock Stein, Sir Matt Busby, Bill Shankly and Sir Alex Ferguson. When Sir Alex was writing his autobiography, Managing My Life, he turned to Mr McIlvanney for help. The journalist said his greatest scoop was finding himself being invited into Muhammad Ali's villa just hours after he had had regained the world heavyweight title from George Foreman in the epic Rumble in the Jungle showdown in Zaire in 1974. But he also had to write about tragic events, including the death of his friend Stein, after the World Cup qualifying game in Cardiff. He was also in Munich in 1972 to report on the Olympic Games when 11 Israeli athletes were murdered by a terror group and reported on the Hillsborough disaster in 1989. Allow Twitter content?

"Jack Shepherd appeared at Tbilisi City Court earlier A man convicted of killing his date in a speedboat crash on the River Thames will be held in a Georgian jail for three months, a judge has ruled. Jack Shepherd's defence team did not challenge the decision to keep him detained before an extradition hearing. He was in hiding in Georgia throughout his trial in the UK for the manslaughter of Charlotte Brown. British Prime Minister Theresa May ""welcomes the news that he is now in custody"". One of Shepherd's defence lawyers told Tbilisi City Court on Friday he should not be extradited because he was warned in a phone call his life might be in danger if he goes to a UK jail. However, the Crown Prosecution Service said it was ""doing everything it can to help make sure Jack Shepherd faces justice through the proper legal channels"". Charlotte Brown, from Clacton-on-Sea, Essex, died after plunging into the icy waters of the River Thames in December 2015 Shepherd told the court he had been working in Georgia, and he greatly regretted going out on the speedboat, adding the accident had left him depressed and suicidal. The 31-year-old had been in the Georgian capital of Tbilisi since March, buthe handed himself into policeon Wednesday. Shepherd told the court: ""Not a single day passes when I don't think about the passing of Charlotte's life and the effect on her family."" He also said he regretted not being at his UK trial. ""I wish I'd sat down with Charlotte's family to explain,"" he said. The court also heard that Shepherd had alcohol dependency and wanted to conduct the appeal against his conviction from Georgia. Shepherd's boat was found to have several defects Shepherd met Ms Brown online and they went on a date on 8 December. Later in the evening he invited her on a speedboat he claimed he owned. The pair were thrown from the boat when it hit branches in the water near Wandsworth Bridge at about midnight. Ms Brown, from Clacton in Essex, was pulled from the water unconscious and unresponsive. A post-mortem examination found she died from cold water immersion. Shepherd made his first appearance at the Old Bailey on 26 January 2018, when he entered a not guilty plea to a charge of manslaughter by gross negligence. He was released on unconditional bail by Judge Richard Marks QC, but failed to show up for his trial and was sentenced to six years in July. Despite being on the run, Shepherd hadwon the right to appeal against his conviction. Shepherd on Wednesday gave an interview to Georgian media proclaiming his innocence Mrs May ""welcomes the news that he is now in custody"", her official spokesman said. ""The government will now work alongside the police and the Crown Prosecution Service to ensure that extradition proceedings are expedited,"" he added. Speedboat killer hands himself in to police Victim was 'my best friend' The speedboat seducer who made a fatal error Shepherd's defence team did not challenge the ruling that he should be kept in custody while his extradition was pending. His lawyer in Georgia, Tariel Kakabadze, said: ""It's Jack Shepherd's decision not to fight for release on today's court session."" Under Georgian law, he can be detained for up to nine months before extradition, he added. Shepherd is also being represented by Mariam Kublashvili, a lawyer who reportedly appeared on Georgia's version of Strictly Come Dancing, who told the BBC her client had been earning money making websites while in Georgia. Meanwhile, it emerged that Shepherd also faces a charge of GBH with intent following an alleged assault on 16 March 2018 in Moretonhampstead in Devon. Shepherd ""was due to have his first appearance in June 2018 but did not turn up and a warrant is live relating to this incident,"" a spokeswoman for the CPS said.

"Scientists say they have discovered the secret behind why some people are skinny while others pile on the pounds easily. Their work reveals newly discovered genetic regions linked to being very slim. The international team say this supports the idea that, for some people, being thin has more to do with inheriting a ""lucky"" set of genes than having a perfect diet or lifestyle. The study appears in PLOS Genetics. Celebrities shunned Prince William charity Footballer's love for Argos embraced Man 'who stole own car' wins settlement In the past few decades, researchers have found hundreds of genetic changes that increase the chance of a person being overweight - but there has been much less focus on the genes of people who are thin. In this investigation, scientists compared DNA samples from 1,600 healthy thin people in the UK - with abody mass index(BMI) of less than 18 - with those of 2,000 severely obese people and 10,400 people of normal weight. They also looked closely at lifestyle questionnaires - to rule out eating disorders, for example. Researchers found people who were obese were more likely to have a set of genes linked to being overweight. Meanwhile, people who were skinny not only had fewer genes linked to obesity but also had changes in gene regions newly associated with healthy thinness. Lead researcher Prof Sadaf Farooqi, from the University of Cambridge, called on people to be less judgemental about others' weight. ""This research shows for the first time that healthy thin people are generally thin because they have a lower burden of genes that increase a person's chances of being overweight and not because they are morally superior, as some people like to suggest,"" she said. ""It's easy to rush to judgement and criticise people for their weight but science shows that things are far more complex. ""We have far less control over our weight than we might wish to think."" Scientists say the next step is to pinpoint the exact genes involved in healthy thinness. Their longer-term goal is to see if this new knowledge can help shape new weight-loss strategies. Commenting on the research, Prof Tom Sanders, emeritus professor of nutrition and dietetics, at King's College London, said: ""This is an important and well conducted study confirming that precocious severe obesity is often genetically determined and showing convincingly that those who are very thin are genetically different from the general population."" But he added: ""Most obesity is acquired in adult life and is linked to the obesogenic environment we live in - a sedentary lifestyle and abundant access to calorie-dense foods."" Prof Tim Spector, also from King's College London, said about a third of people in most countries managed to remain thin despite this. ""Some of this is down to genes but other factors like individual differences in lifestyle or gut microbes are likely to also be responsible,"" he said. Health experts say whatever your shape or genetic make-up, the age-old advice of a healthy level of exercise and good diet still stands.

"The film stars Rami Malek as Freddie Mercury and Gwilym Lee as Brian May Bohemian Rhapsody has been removed as a nominee for a major LGBT award show, following new accusations of sexual assault against director Bryan Singer. The allegationswerethe result of a year-long investigation by US magazine The Atlantic,external, and included claims that the director had sex with underage men. He denies the allegations, saying they are a ""homophobic slur"" against him. But Glaad said it would not honour his latest film, saying ""survivors of sexual assault should be put first"". Singer, whose previous credits include The Usual Suspects and X-Men, was fired from Bohemian Rhapsody three weeks before filming ended, amid reports of erratic behaviour and personality clashes with the star, Rami Malek. Singer oversaw the launch of the X-Men franchise, which kick-started the boom in superhero movies British director Dexter Fletcher was brought in to complete the project, but in accordance with Director's Guild rules, Singer's name remained on the film's credits. Glaad said in a statement: ""This week's story in The Atlantic documenting unspeakable harms endured by young men and teenage boys brought to light a reality that cannot be ignored or even tacitly rewarded. ""Singer's response to The Atlantic story wrongfully used 'homophobia' to deflect from sexual assault allegations and Glaad urges the media and the industry at large to not gloss over the fact that survivors of sexual assault should be put first."" Glaad is a media monitoring organisation which hands out awards each year to recognise outstanding representations of the LGBT community in the media. It described the decision to remove Bohemian Rhapsody as a ""difficult"" one, adding: ""The legacy of Freddy Mercury deserves so much more than to be tainted in this way"". The film was nominated for five Oscars earlier this week, although Singer failed to make the best director shortlist. The 53-year-old was dropped by his agency last year, but was recently hired to direct an adaptation of the cult comic Red Sonja. Producers have confirmed he will keep the job despite the latest allegations. ""The over $800m Bohemian Rhapsody has grossed... is testament to his remarkable vision and acumen,"" said Millennium Films' boss Avi Lernertold The Hollywood Reporter.,external ""I know the difference between agenda-driven fake news and reality, and I am very comfortable with this decision. In America people are innocent until proven otherwise."" Millennium Films was itself hit with allegations of sexual harassment and gender bias, with Lerner accused of making disparaging remarks towards female employees.

"A professional snake handler was called to remove the 1.5m (5ft) python An Australian woman ""jumped off her seat"" after being bitten by a snake on the toilet, a reptile handler says. Helen Richards, 59, received the non-venomous strike in the dark at a relative's house in Brisbane on Tuesday. She received minor puncture wounds from the 1.5m (5ft) carpet python. Handler Jasmine Zeleny, who retrieved the reptile, said it was common to find snakes seeking water in toilets during hot weather. Ms Richards told local media she had felt a ""sharp tap"". ""I jumped up with my pants down and turned around to see what looked like a longneck turtle receding back into the bowl,""she told The Courier Mail newspaper,external. The carpet python was most likely seeking water, handler Jasmine Zeleny says Ms Zeleny said Ms Richards had treated the minor bite marks with an antiseptic, describing carpet pythons as relatively harmless.

"Natasha Ednan-Laperouse died in a hospital in Nice after collapsing on a BA flight Stronger food labelling laws are being proposed to prevent further deaths of people with allergies. All packaged food such as sandwiches and salads could be required to list the full ingredients. It comes after the death of Natasha Ednan-Laperouse, 15, of Fulham, London, who suffered an allergic reaction to a Pret a Manger baguette in 2016. Under current laws, the company did not have to list the ingredients of food packed and sold on the premises. The inquest into Natasha's death heard that the teenager was ""reassured"" by the lack of specific allergen information on the packaging when she bought the sandwich at Heathrow Airport.

"This video can not be played Commons Leader Andrea Leadsom tells Newsnight the EU could grant the UK a âcouple of extra weeksâ to finalise Brexit The EU could be ready to drop some of its ""red lines"" from the Brexit deal it struck with the UK to ""help"" save it, Chancellor Philip Hammond has said. He did not believe the EU would scrap the backstop plan to keep the border open between Northern Ireland and Ireland. But some EU leaders were ""looking at what they can do"" to change it. Andrea Leadsom has, meanwhile, said the EU would delay Brexit for a ""couple of weeks"" to help get a deal through. Could EU offer an extra 'couple of weeks'? Troops 'could return to Irish border' How many trade agreements has the UK done? New Brexit poll 'should not be last option' She told the BBC's Newsnight that due to our ""very strong relationship"" with the EU, a short extension would be ""feasible"". But Downing Street said: ""There is no change to our position. ""We are not considering an extension to Article 50 and are committed to doing whatever it takes to have the statute books ready for when we leave the EU on 29 March this year."" The UK is set to leave the EU on that date, with or without a deal. Theresa May is battling to get her plan through Parliament, despite the fact it suffered an historic defeat in the Commons last week - losing by 432 votes to 202. A major part of the loss was because of the controversial backstop, which is the fallback position for after Brexit to ensure a hard border is not introduced. Without a hard border, there will be no checks on people or goods passing between the two countries - as it is now. Critics claim the backstop plan separates Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK by keeping it more closely aligned to EU rules. But its backers say it will prevent political tensions rising along the border. This video can not be played Reality Check unpacks the basics of the backstop. Downing Street said it was continuing conversations with MPs to address a range of concerns about the backstop ahead of the plan returning to the Commons on Tuesday - including with hard-line Brexiteers in the Tory Party and the DUP, which supports the government in Parliament but voted against her deal. Both sets of MPs have said they will not vote for the PM's deal while the backstop is part of it. No 10 admitted they were ""not there yet"" with a new proposal to take to Brussels, but said there was a clear message from the EU that they wanted the UK to leave with a deal and, in order to do so, there will have to be some changes. Some backbench MPs are trying to make the deal more palatable by removing, replacing or time-limiting the backstop, while others are trying to force ministers to delay Britain's departure from the EU for up to a year if MPs can't agree on a deal by 26 February, to prevent a no-deal Brexit. Please upgrade your browser Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme from Davos earlier, Mr Hammond said leaving with a withdrawal agreement was the ""only credible and sustainable way"" forward and warned of ""very significant disruption"" for the UK economy if the country left the EU without a deal. But he claimed some European politicians were ""thinking very hard about where the European Union has drawn its red lines [and] whether they really need to be in the place where they have been drawn"". He added: ""What I am hearing from European politicians and commentators is that they do take this issue very seriously, they understand the challenge that we have got at home and generally - not all of them, but many of them - want to help. ""They are not prepared to compromise on the fundamental principles that the EU has set out, but they certainly are looking at whether there is anything they can do without compromising those principles."" French finance minister Bruno Le Maire said it was up to the British government to find a way out of the situation, not EU member states. He told Today that the backstop issue was ""done"" and the EU had ""nothing to give"" on the Brexit deal apart from ""clarifications"". Mr Hammond said the French had ""always been the hardest in this debate"" and talking to other European politicians would offer ""a more balanced view"". By Chris Mason, BBC political correspondent Speak to people from the government in private, and some will tell you they think minds are moving on their own side. They hope some Brexiteers are open to compromise; willing to climb down, if only they can be provided with a ladder. And now the chancellor has said in public that perhaps the EU is willing to budge at least a bit too. On Tuesday, MPs will get a chance to express their views on a range of possible options, which could, depending on how the day plays out, hand the prime minister numerical evidence that Parliament may be able to support a variation of her Brexit deal - if the EU is willing to compromise too. Publicly, the EU is saying what it has always said - the withdrawal agreement is finished and it isn't being re-opened. So, the big question will be, is anything Parliament could potentially coalesce around and vote through also palatable to the EU? We are not likely to get any indication of that until at least the middle of next week. In an interview with BBC's Newsnight, Mrs Leadsom said she believed the government could still get Mrs May's deal through Parliament before 29 March. But, she added: ""In spite of everything, we have a very strong relationship with our EU friends and neighbours and I am absolutely certain that if we needed a couple of extra weeks or something then that would be feasible. ""We would want to think carefully about it, but as things stand, I do feel that we can get, with the support of both houses - the House of Commons and the House of Lords - with goodwill and a determination, we can still get the legislation through in time."" Read more from the Newsnight interview on Nick Watt's blog The deputy leader of the DUP, Nigel Dodds, said he had been ""encouraged"" by a change in tone from Europe - namely a speech by the EU's chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, who said on Wednesday that they would ""have to find an operational way"" of carrying out checks without putting a hard border between Ireland and Northern Ireland. Mr Dodds called it a ""new and more realistic approach"" and ""a long way from the dramatic language EU spokespeople were using this time last year"". But Mark Francois, a Tory MP and vice chairman of the pro-Leave European Research Group, said: ""The only thing that we would contemplate is if the entire backstop is removed from the [deal]."" ""They'd have to take it out lock, stock and barrel. I don't know whether the EU would be prepared to do that, but if they're not, then we're not going to support it."" On Thursday, the German boss of Airbus, Tom Enders criticised Brexiteer ""madness"" and said his company might have to make ""potentially very harmful decisions for the UK"" in the event of it leaving the EU with no deal. Airbus currently employs 14,000 workers in the UK and every wing on its commercial aircraft is currently made here. In a video message, Mr Enders said: âPlease donât listen to the Brexiteersâ madness which asserts that âbecause we have huge plants here we will not move and we will always be hereâ. They are wrong.â But Mr Francois hit back in a live interview on BBC News, tearing up Mr Enders' words and saying: ""My father, Reginald Francois, was a D-Day veteran.

"Fuller's, the brewer whose beers include London Pride, is to sell its entire drinks business to Japan's biggest brewer Asahi. The company said the Â£250m deal,externalwould preserve the Griffin Brewery in Chiswick, west London, where beer has been brewed since 1654. Fuller's will now focus on its hotels and pubs business, which generates most of its profits. Asahi is the owner of the Peroni and Grolsch brands. Fuller's said the deal - which also includes cider and soft drinks brand Cornish Orchards and craft cask brewer Dark Star - was due to ""structural changes to the beer industry"". As a mid-sized brewer, the company said it was being squeezed between the global brewers and the 2,000 smaller brewers across the UK. The Campaign for Real Ale (Camra) said it was a ""sad day"" for the industry. Fuller's is forming an alliance with Asahi to enable its pubs and hotels to continue to sell the beers and ciders. Simon Emeny, chief executive of Fuller's, said: ""The deal secures the future of both part of our business including protecting the heritage of the Griffin Brewery in Chiswick, which was particularly important to the Fuller's board"". While the Griffin Brewery dates back to the era of Oliver Cromwell, the business - full name Fuller, Smith & Turner - was formally created in 1845. Mr Emeny is the first chief executive of the business not to have come from one of the founding families, taking over in 2013. Just over 50% of the shares are still owned by descendents of the founding families. Neil Wilson, chief markets analyst at Markets.com, said: ""Punters won't notice much difference at the bar. Pubs may be closing at a hell of a clip these days but consumers still want experiences and dining out is one of those. ""Therefore investing in pubs and hotels is essential as consumers demand more from their pub experience."" Can pubs stand many more Dry Januarys? He said the deal was well timed because of the fall in the pound. ""Right now with the pound still very undervalued it looks to be a good time to swoop. The Japanese firm has been gobbling up brewers across Europe and elsewhere on major buying spree."" By Katie Prescott, BBC Radio 4 Today business presenter Like the ravens leaving the Tower of London is how one commentator described the sale of London Pride to Asahi. But while there may be an emotional significance, drinkers are unlikely to notice a change to the branding or formula in the pub. The two companies have signed a long-term strategic alliance and Asahi has committed to supporting the UK breweries behind Fuller's brands. Fuller's plans to focus its attention on its pubs and hotels where it makes 87% of its profits. It says that tax breaks given to microbrewers and the power of the big global drinks firms has left little space at the bar for those in the middle. It's giving some of the proceeds to shareholders and its pension fund, and with a 22% rise in its share price this morning investors are certainly clinking glasses at the deal. Asahi has already expanded in Europe by buying the Peroni, Grolsch, Meantime and Pilsner Urquell brands. Akiyoshi Koji, chief executive of Asahi, said the Fuller's brands would complement its existing brands in the UK. ""In particular, London Pride is a fantastic brand with a illustrious heritage dating back to the 1950s"". Asahi will continue to brew at the Griffin Brewery and is already a supplier to Fuller's hotels and 400 or so managed and tenanted pubs in London and the South East. The new owners will continue to brew beer at the Griffin Brewery in west London Jackie Parker, chair  of Camra, said she was concerned that consolidation was ""seldom beneficial for consumers"". ""Fuller's has been a family brewer in Britain for more than a hundred years, and it's a very sad day to see such a well-known, historic and respected name exit the brewing business. ""While the Fuller's family has stressed it has sought to protect the heritage of the Griffin Brewery, we'd call on the new owners to pledge to continue brewing operations at the Chiswick site."" Fuller's also issued a trading update, which Mr Emeny described as ""very good"", adding he was ""particularly pleased"" with sales at its managed pubs and hotels over the key Christmas and New Year period. Like-for-like sales - which strip out new openings - at its managed pubs and hotels rose by 4.7% over the 42 weeks to 19 January, whereas beer and cider volumes were flat.

"There has been a steep rise in unconditional offers Universities that use unconditional offers to pressurise students into accepting places could be fined or even lose their university status, England's higher education watchdog says. The Office for Students (OfS) compares the indiscriminate use of unconditional offers to pressure selling and says it could be in breach of consumer law. There has been a steep rise in students offered places irrespective of grades. But Sheffield Hallam University said such offers could help some students. It makes hundreds of unconditional offers each year to students with high predicted A-level grades. And vice-chancellor Chris Husbands said unconditional offers had a place, particularly for young people who ""might otherwise not have the opportunity to study at a very high level"". ""What unconditional offers can do when used in this way is to remove one element of pressure from the system and then ideally help students to achieve their potential and to thrive,"" he added. Students lured with unconditional offers Huge rise in unconditional offers University halts unconditional offers OfS researchers looked at the two different kinds of unconditional offer, those that: guarantee a place, with no conditions are unconditional only if an applicant makes the university their first choice Overall, the number of unconditional offers to 18-year-olds rose from 3,000 in 2013 to 117,000 in 2018, while ""conditional unconditional"" offers rose from zero in 2013 to 66,000 by 2018. Applicants who accepted an unconditional offer were more likely to miss their predicted grades by two or more grades, the researchers found. Schools and colleges have voiced concerns that students with unconditional offers can underachieve in their exams as they ""take their foot off the gas"" during revision. OfS chief executive Nicola Dandridge said she was concerned about the rapid rise in unconditional offers, ""particularly those with strings attached, which are akin to pressure selling"". ""It is plainly not in students' interests to push them to accept an offer that may not be their best option,"" she said. ""If we identify cases where unconditional offers are having an obvious negative impact on students' choices or outcomes, we are of course prepared to intervene."" Applicants with unconditional offers often miss their predicted grades The OfS said it would: continue to monitor and assess the use of unconditional offers intervene where students with unconditional or very low offers risked poor degrees or dropping out of their courses encourage students to challenge ""pressure selling practices"" take its own regulatory action, from imposing internal changes on universities to fines and deregistration. On the online forum The Student Room some of this year's university applicants backed better regulation. One reported having had four unconditional offers out of five applications but only ""if I put them as my [first choice], which makes me believe that the universities do not actually care if I get the grade, instead, they just care about how many places they fill and want to guarantee as many as possible with the appeal of an unconditional offer"". Another said: ""They can prey on the insecurities of strong students who could do better but are scared of missing a conditional offer."" Overall, 14% of students received unconditional offers last year - but this varied widely between types of institution. Highly selective universities that demand very high A-level grades are least likely to make unconditional offers, with those that ask for lower grades more likely to make unconditional offers. The Universities and Colleges Admissions Service (Ucas) said that later in January it would, for the first time, publish details of the numbers unconditional offers made by each institution. Greg Walker, chief executive of the MillionPlus group of universities, said unconditional offers were a longstanding part of the system. ""Higher education plays a major role in narrowing educational gaps that occur in primary and secondary education,"" he said, ""and since the evidence shows that lower socio-economic status is correlated to lower prior attainment, using unconditional offers to support students with the potential to succeed is a valid and necessary approach to enable social equality."" But Matt Waddup, head of policy at the University and College Union, called for universities to shift to a system where students applied to university after they had received their grades, to make ""unconditional offers redundant, bring us in line with the rest of the world and end the chaotic clearing scramble"". And David Hughes, chief executive of the Association of Colleges, said there were better ways to broaden the range of students attending university, such as ""contextualised offers"".

"Captain Matthew Flinders is credited with naming Australia The remains of explorer Captain Matthew Flinders have been identified by archaeologists working on the HS2 project in a London burial ground. Captain Flinders led the first circumnavigation of Australia and is credited with naming the country. Some 61,000 skeletons will be removed from St James's Gardens, where the station for the HS2 rail route will be built near London Euston station. A recently discovered coffin showed the captain was buried on 23 July 1814. The dig began in October- one of 60 archaeological sites between London and Birmingham being explored prior to the construction of the Â£55bn high-speed rail line. It was known Captain Flinders was among the thousands of people buried at the site, which was built over when Euston station was expanded in the 19th Century but it was unclear whether his body or others would be able to be identified. Archaeologists were able to identify the remains of the explorer by a lead plate placed on top of his coffin The discovery so early in the dig has thrilled archaeologists who were not confident they would find Captain Flinders among the 40,000 people interred there, HS2 said. They were able to identify his remains by the lead breast plate placed on top of his coffin. This video can not be played How do you move the remains of 40,000 people? Captain Flinders, who was from Lincolnshire, made several significant journeys, notably as commander of HMS Investigator. In the ship he became the first known person to navigate around the entire coast of Australia, confirming it as a continent. He is also credited with giving Australia its name - although he was not the first to use the term, his work popularised its use. Iceland still selling own-brand palm oil Social media stars agree to declare ads How a nine-year-old exposed police for killing his family Hywel Griffith, BBC News Sydney correspondent You don't need to go far in Australia to find the name Flinders. Streets, stations, mountains, towns, a river, a reef and a university all carry the captain's moniker. But the man credited with mapping this vast country and identifying it as a continent also has a lesser-known legacy. Matthew Flinders also found time to write a biography of Trim, his ship's cat. Trim survived storms, a fall overboard and a shipwreck before, according to Captain Flinders, eventually being eaten by starving slaves in Mauritius. There is even a statue in Sydney to celebrate Trim, and the obvious affection shown to him by his intrepid, seafaring owner. The headstone marking his final resting place was removed following the expansion of Euston Station into part of the burial ground in the 1840s, and it was thought his remains had been lost. Over 200 archaeologists and specialists are working at the site beside Euston Station At the bicentenary of his death, a statue was unveiled by the Duke of Cambridge at Australia House andlater installed at Euston Station. Helen Wass, HS2 head of heritage, said: ""The discovery is an incredible opportunity for us to learn more about the life and remarkable achievements of this British navigator, hydrographer and scientist. ""Given the number of human remains at St James's, we weren't confident that we were going to find him. ""We'll now be able to study his skeleton to see whether life at sea left its mark and what more we can learn about him.""

"Facebook eventually settled a lawsuit about the issue of children and in-app payments A trove of internal documents have revealed how Facebook was concerned children were spending large amounts on in-app payments without parentsâ permission - but seemingly chose not to act. Discussions showed the firm decided not to implement certain safeguards as it might affect overall revenues from people paying for games. The documents formed part of a lawsuit that was settled in 2016, after which Facebook agreed to change its practices. Between February 2008 and June 2014, Facebook said it made just over $34m from accounts belonging to minors in the United States. The information had been kept under seal, untilthe Center for Investigative Reporting recently made a request for them to be made public,external. Last week a judge ordered Facebook to provide the extra material. It did so on Thursday. The files show discussions between Facebook employees about how in-app payments were occurring within the platform, and whether children might be unwittingly spending real money during games. Tara Stewart, a risk analyst for Facebook, remarked that in-game currency often âdoesnât necessarily look like real money to a minorâ. The investigation was prompted by Finnish game developer Rovio. It told Facebook it had noticed an âalarmingly high refund rate"", caused by what is known as âfriendly fraudâ. The term typically refers to instances when parents discovered a child has been using their credit card to buy features or add-ons in a game. Facebook considered it âreally important to make Angry Birds a success storyâ - referencing Rovioâs smash hit game - and so investigated what was causing so many refund requests. ""In nearly all cases the parents knew their child was playing Angry Birds, but didnât think the child would be allowed to buy anything without their password or authorisation first,â read one memo, written by Facebook employee Danny Stein. Mr Stein went on to say that the company could build an automated method that might reduce the problem, but that it âwould most likely block good total payment volumeâ. While Facebook did not develop the games in question, payments were made through its system which, at the time, did not have additional measures in place that required parents to re-verify card use if a child was spending more money. Facebook took a 30% cut of payments, with the rest going to the gameâs developer. Facebook considered changing its system so that users under 17 (and over 90) who tried to make transactions worth over $75 would have to enter the first six digits of the payment card on file, in order to prove they were in possession of it, or could at least remember it. While not foolproof, Ms Stewart - who appears to have put forward the measure - said she believed it would âcurb the spending of the least savvy minorsâ. A colleague added: âIt should keep kids from running rampant with their parents CCs.â Facebook did not implement the idea. âWhaleâ denied refund In another discussion, employees talked about how one so-called âwhaleâ - an industry-wide term for customers who spend a lot of money on in-app payments - should not be given a refund. The account had spent $6,545. ""That user looks underage as well,â one Facebook employee noted, perhaps a â13ish year old"". A colleague replied: âI wouldnât refund."" As part of the 2016 settlement, Facebook paid out $5,000 each to the families of two children who racked up large bills apparently without their parentsâ knowledge. ""He thought he was playing with virtual reality money,â said Glynnis Bohannon, the mother of one of the children. The boy, who was 12 at the time, was playing a title called Ninja Saga and eventually spent $610.40 before Ms Bohannon was warned about the activity by her credit card company. ""He thought he was playing so good and it just was telling him that if he re-clicked it, it would regenerate,â she said. ""He thought it was within the game.

"There has been a steep rise in unconditional offers Universities that use unconditional offers to pressurise students into accepting places could be fined or even lose their university status, England's higher education watchdog says. The Office for Students (OfS) compares the indiscriminate use of unconditional offers to pressure selling and says it could be in breach of consumer law. There has been a steep rise in students offered places irrespective of grades. But Sheffield Hallam University said such offers could help some students. It makes hundreds of unconditional offers each year to students with high predicted A-level grades. And vice-chancellor Chris Husbands said unconditional offers had a place, particularly for young people who ""might otherwise not have the opportunity to study at a very high level"". ""What unconditional offers can do when used in this way is to remove one element of pressure from the system and then ideally help students to achieve their potential and to thrive,"" he added. Students lured with unconditional offers Huge rise in unconditional offers University halts unconditional offers OfS researchers looked at the two different kinds of unconditional offer, those that: guarantee a place, with no conditions are unconditional only if an applicant makes the university their first choice Overall, the number of unconditional offers to 18-year-olds rose from 3,000 in 2013 to 117,000 in 2018, while ""conditional unconditional"" offers rose from zero in 2013 to 66,000 by 2018. Applicants who accepted an unconditional offer were more likely to miss their predicted grades by two or more grades, the researchers found. Schools and colleges have voiced concerns that students with unconditional offers can underachieve in their exams as they ""take their foot off the gas"" during revision. OfS chief executive Nicola Dandridge said she was concerned about the rapid rise in unconditional offers, ""particularly those with strings attached, which are akin to pressure selling"". ""It is plainly not in students' interests to push them to accept an offer that may not be their best option,"" she said. ""If we identify cases where unconditional offers are having an obvious negative impact on students' choices or outcomes, we are of course prepared to intervene."" Applicants with unconditional offers often miss their predicted grades The OfS said it would: continue to monitor and assess the use of unconditional offers intervene where students with unconditional or very low offers risked poor degrees or dropping out of their courses encourage students to challenge ""pressure selling practices"" take its own regulatory action, from imposing internal changes on universities to fines and deregistration. On the online forum The Student Room some of this year's university applicants backed better regulation. One reported having had four unconditional offers out of five applications but only ""if I put them as my [first choice], which makes me believe that the universities do not actually care if I get the grade, instead, they just care about how many places they fill and want to guarantee as many as possible with the appeal of an unconditional offer"". Another said: ""They can prey on the insecurities of strong students who could do better but are scared of missing a conditional offer."" Overall, 14% of students received unconditional offers last year - but this varied widely between types of institution. Highly selective universities that demand very high A-level grades are least likely to make unconditional offers, with those that ask for lower grades more likely to make unconditional offers. The Universities and Colleges Admissions Service (Ucas) said that later in January it would, for the first time, publish details of the numbers unconditional offers made by each institution. Greg Walker, chief executive of the MillionPlus group of universities, said unconditional offers were a longstanding part of the system. ""Higher education plays a major role in narrowing educational gaps that occur in primary and secondary education,"" he said, ""and since the evidence shows that lower socio-economic status is correlated to lower prior attainment, using unconditional offers to support students with the potential to succeed is a valid and necessary approach to enable social equality."" But Matt Waddup, head of policy at the University and College Union, called for universities to shift to a system where students applied to university after they had received their grades, to make ""unconditional offers redundant, bring us in line with the rest of the world and end the chaotic clearing scramble"". And David Hughes, chief executive of the Association of Colleges, said there were better ways to broaden the range of students attending university, such as ""contextualised offers"".

"This video can not be played Hugh McIlvanney worked as a journalist for 60 years Hugh McIlvanney, widely considered to be one of Britain's greatest sports journalists, has died at the age of 84. Mr McIlvanney, who was born in Kilmarnock, worked for the Observer and then the Sunday Times, covering some of the most significant sporting events of his age. These included the fight in 1974 between Muhammad Ali and George Foreman known as the Rumble in the Jungle. He retired in 2016 after 60 years as a journalist. BBC Radio 4 - McIlvanney, Ferguson and a game of Trivial Pursuit The brothers who wrote their way to fame Hugh McIlvanney: A life in sport BBC Radio Scotland - The McIlvanney Conversations Mr McIlvanney was inducted into both the International Boxing Hall of Fame (2009) and the Scottish Football Hall of Fame (2011). His career began on his local newspaper before spells on The Scotsman and The Daily Express led to him working at The Observer and eventually The Sunday Times. He went on to forge close working and personal relationships with, perhaps, the four finest football managers to emerge from Scotland - Jock Stein, Sir Matt Busby, Bill Shankly and Sir Alex Ferguson. When Sir Alex was writing his autobiography, Managing My Life, he turned to Mr McIlvanney for help. The journalist said his greatest scoop was finding himself being invited into Muhammad Ali's villa just hours after he had had regained the world heavyweight title from George Foreman in the epic Rumble in the Jungle showdown in Zaire in 1974. But he also had to write about tragic events, including the death of his friend Stein, after the World Cup qualifying game in Cardiff. He was also in Munich in 1972 to report on the Olympic Games when 11 Israeli athletes were murdered by a terror group and reported on the Hillsborough disaster in 1989. Allow Twitter content?

"This video can not be played Rocking beds helped grown-ups sleep more soundly, researchers found We know babies benefit from being rocked to sleep - now a study suggests it helps adults sleep better too. Researchers from the University of Geneva built a special bed that rocked gently throughout the night. They tested it on 18 young adults and found they woke up fewer times and slept more deeply than on a normal bed. Scientists said the rocking motion resulted in a longer period of slow brainwaves which caused deep sleep, and improved their memory. The volunteers spent three nights at a sleep laboratory in Geneva: one to get them used to sleeping there, one on a rocking bed and the other on the same bed, but in a still position. Electrodes recorded their brainwaves, and found that the period of deep sleep was extended by rocking. Six tips for a good night's sleep Body clock linked to mood disorders Should we all become early risers? Laurence Bayer, lead study author and researcher at UNIGE Faculty of Medicine, pointed out that the rocking motion was slow enough not to cause nausea. ""A hammock would probably not be as efficient, although people often report a sense of relaxation when rocked in a hammock,"" she said. ""In our paper we test the effect of rocking on one night, but we have no idea if the effects will still be there over a long-term period."" Sleeping in a hammock is not as efficient as sleeping in bed, the lead study author said The researchers also found the adults had better memory recall in the morning if they slept on the rocking bed. Aurore Perrault, another researcher at the faculty, said: ""To see if this also affected memory, we subjected our participants to memory tests: they had to learn pairs of random words in the evening and remember them in the morning when they woke up,"" she said. ""Here too, rocking proved beneficial: the test results were much better after a night in motion than after a still night."" A parallel study conducted by the University of Lausanne in Switzerland looked at the effect of gently rocking the cages of mice while they went to sleep. It found that rocking reduced the time they needed to fall asleep and increased their sleep time. However, it did not appear to increase sleep quality, like it did in human beings. The study in mice also proved that the vestibular system, the system that tells the brain when our head is moving, has to be functioning for rocking to be effective. Researchers agreed that in the absence of rocking beds being widely available, more research was needed to determine how the findings could help people with sleep disorders. Prof Sophie Schwartz, a neuroscientist at UNIGE, and author of the study, said the research explained why people fell asleep on trains, and other vehicles. ""I was contacted by someone in America who works on a high crane, which moves gently all day,"" she said. ""He told me that now he understands why he sleeps so deeply during his after-lunch nap.""

"Facebook eventually settled a lawsuit about the issue of children and in-app payments A trove of internal documents have revealed how Facebook was concerned children were spending large amounts on in-app payments without parentsâ permission - but seemingly chose not to act. Discussions showed the firm decided not to implement certain safeguards as it might affect overall revenues from people paying for games. The documents formed part of a lawsuit that was settled in 2016, after which Facebook agreed to change its practices. Between February 2008 and June 2014, Facebook said it made just over $34m from accounts belonging to minors in the United States. The information had been kept under seal, untilthe Center for Investigative Reporting recently made a request for them to be made public,external. Last week a judge ordered Facebook to provide the extra material. It did so on Thursday. The files show discussions between Facebook employees about how in-app payments were occurring within the platform, and whether children might be unwittingly spending real money during games. Tara Stewart, a risk analyst for Facebook, remarked that in-game currency often âdoesnât necessarily look like real money to a minorâ. The investigation was prompted by Finnish game developer Rovio. It told Facebook it had noticed an âalarmingly high refund rate"", caused by what is known as âfriendly fraudâ. The term typically refers to instances when parents discovered a child has been using their credit card to buy features or add-ons in a game. Facebook considered it âreally important to make Angry Birds a success storyâ - referencing Rovioâs smash hit game - and so investigated what was causing so many refund requests. ""In nearly all cases the parents knew their child was playing Angry Birds, but didnât think the child would be allowed to buy anything without their password or authorisation first,â read one memo, written by Facebook employee Danny Stein. Mr Stein went on to say that the company could build an automated method that might reduce the problem, but that it âwould most likely block good total payment volumeâ. While Facebook did not develop the games in question, payments were made through its system which, at the time, did not have additional measures in place that required parents to re-verify card use if a child was spending more money. Facebook took a 30% cut of payments, with the rest going to the gameâs developer. Facebook considered changing its system so that users under 17 (and over 90) who tried to make transactions worth over $75 would have to enter the first six digits of the payment card on file, in order to prove they were in possession of it, or could at least remember it. While not foolproof, Ms Stewart - who appears to have put forward the measure - said she believed it would âcurb the spending of the least savvy minorsâ. A colleague added: âIt should keep kids from running rampant with their parents CCs.â Facebook did not implement the idea. âWhaleâ denied refund In another discussion, employees talked about how one so-called âwhaleâ - an industry-wide term for customers who spend a lot of money on in-app payments - should not be given a refund. The account had spent $6,545. ""That user looks underage as well,â one Facebook employee noted, perhaps a â13ish year old"". A colleague replied: âI wouldnât refund."" As part of the 2016 settlement, Facebook paid out $5,000 each to the families of two children who racked up large bills apparently without their parentsâ knowledge. ""He thought he was playing with virtual reality money,â said Glynnis Bohannon, the mother of one of the children. The boy, who was 12 at the time, was playing a title called Ninja Saga and eventually spent $610.40 before Ms Bohannon was warned about the activity by her credit card company. ""He thought he was playing so good and it just was telling him that if he re-clicked it, it would regenerate,â she said. ""He thought it was within the game. He had no understanding that every time he clicked it, it was going to go on my credit card.â In a statement, Facebook said it ""works with parents and experts to offer tools for families navigating Facebook and the webâ.

"British clothing manufacturers have been forced to pay almost Â£90,000 to employees for non-payment of the minimum wage. An HM Revenue & Customs investigation found that over a six-year period 126 garment workers were paid wage arrears. MP Mary Creagh, who reviewed the HMRC data, said it showed exploitation in the industry was still ""rife"". HMRC has 14 ongoing investigations, and it found underpayment in one in every four inspections. ""This [exploitation] must stop,"" said Ms Creagh, chairwoman of the Environmental Audit Committee. ""We need government action to end these 19th century practices in 21st century Britain. ""It has been 20 years since the introduction of the minimum wage but in our inquiry we heard that underpayment is rife and goes hand-in-hand with a culture of fear and intimidation in the UK's textile industry."" The committee has been looking into the sustainability of the fashion industry. In October, it warned thatfast fashion is damaging the planet, and in November MPs quizzed retail executives on how firms could justifyselling clothes for Â£5 or less. According to Adam Mansell, chief executive of the UK Fashion and Textile Association (UKFTA), retailers have long been aware that problems exist with exploitation of workers in Britain, but the problems are numerous and difficult to solve. ""There have been efforts in the past to shut down these factories, but unfortunately what happens is they operate under a phoenix system where they will close one day, and then open up under a different name the next day,"" he told the BBC. 'How do you justify selling a Â£2 T-shirt?' Fast fashion is harming the planet, MPs say Asics to recycle clothes into Olympic wear And following attempts by retailers to quell exploitation by publicly terminating contracts with certain factories, some factory owners have found other ways to evade detection of their business practices. ""For instance, you place an order with Factory A, but they outsource that manufacturing to Factory B or C [which might be exploiting workers], so the retailer doesn't get to see the factory where the goods are actually being made,"" said Mr Mansell. Some illegal practices persist because exploited workers choose not to report employers The trade body has also received anecdotal evidence that many of the exploited workers claim state benefits, which makes them more likely to accept being paid below minimum wage. ""The retailers and government enforcement agencies are aware of this and they don't want to put people who are being exploited in an even worse position,"" he added. UKFTA is working with the government and retailers to try to prevent exploitation. ""In London, there are 13,500 people employed making clothes for high-end fashion brands. Quite often these brands pay a London living wage,"" said Mr Mansell. ""If you can afford to operate in London, make a profit and still pay a living wage, then there's no reason you can't do this anywhere else in the country.""

"This video can not be played Who's really in charge in Venezuela? The BBC's Paul Adams explains Venezuelan opposition leader Juan GuaidÃ³ has said he would consider an amnesty for President NicolÃ¡s Maduro if he cedes power. Mr GuaidÃ³, who declared himself interim president on Wednesday, said he was reaching out to all sectors including the military to end the crisis. Mr Maduro began a second term after polls marred by an opposition boycottand vote-rigging claims. The global community is split on whether to recognise his government. But so far, Mr Maduro retains the crucial support of Venezuela's military. The US, more than a dozen Latin American countries, Canada and the UK have backed Mr GuaidÃ³ - who is leader of Venezuela's elected National Congress - after he said he was the legitimate president. But Russia has condemned foreign support for Mr GuaidÃ³, saying it violates international law and is a ""direct path to bloodshed"".

Analysis by Natalie Sherman, BBC News Business Reporter The US has already imposed a raft of sanctions in the past two years, which target officials in the Maduro government, restrict Venezuela's access to US debt markets and block dealings with those involved in the country's gold trade. But so far, the Trump administration has not taken action directly against oil imports, which are a key source of cash. A stand-off over US embassy personnel could push the White House to take that step. But analysts cautioned that oil sanctions would likely have limited effect on the Maduro regime, which could redirect shipments to allies such as China and Russia, while blaming the US for any additional hardship.

"Natasha Ednan-Laperouse died in a hospital in Nice after collapsing on a BA flight Stronger food labelling laws are being proposed to prevent further deaths of people with allergies. All packaged food such as sandwiches and salads could be required to list the full ingredients. It comes after the death of Natasha Ednan-Laperouse, 15, of Fulham, London, who suffered an allergic reaction to a Pret a Manger baguette in 2016. Under current laws, the company did not have to list the ingredients of food packed and sold on the premises. The inquest into Natasha's death heard that the teenager was ""reassured"" by the lack of specific allergen information on the packaging when she bought the sandwich at Heathrow Airport. But the baguette contained sesame seeds, whichcaused her to go into cardiac arrest on a flightin 2016. Nadim Ednan-Laperouse, Natasha's father, told Radio 4's Today programme that it was vital action was taken ""to prevent this kind of tragedy happening to other people"". Four options are now being put forward for labelling food which is made, packaged and sold on the same premises: Full ingredient list labelling Allergen-only labelling Ask-the-staff labels with supporting information available for consumers in writing Promoting best practice around communicating allergen information to customers Natasha's mother Tanya said that ""we're really gunning for the top option which is full labelling - allergens and ingredients"", adding that the other ""very soft"" alternatives weren't ""options in our mind at all"". She said the proposals could see the UK lead the way in helping people with allergies around the world. ""We've got an opportunity to spearhead something really amazing here,"" she said. Natasha's brother, father and mother attended the inquest at West London Coroner's Court Environment Secretary Michael Gove, who has had several meetings with Natasha's parents, called the proposed new regulations ""Natasha's Law"" and paid tribute to the ""inspirational work"" of her parents in advocating for it. Can lessons be learned from Pret baguette death? Pret taking risks, say allergy sufferers Baguette death: Pret labels 'inadequate' He said: ""We want to ensure that labels are clearer and that the rules for businesses are more consistent, so that allergy sufferers in this country can have confidence in the safety of their food. ""Many businesses are already bringing changes on board independently, and in the meantime they should continue doing all they can to give consumers the information they need."" Allergy UK chief executive Carla Jones said that the food industry needed to do ""more than just the bare minimum"" when catering for the estimated two million people in the UK with food allergies.

"Captain Matthew Flinders is credited with naming Australia The remains of explorer Captain Matthew Flinders have been identified by archaeologists working on the HS2 project in a London burial ground. Captain Flinders led the first circumnavigation of Australia and is credited with naming the country. Some 61,000 skeletons will be removed from St James's Gardens, where the station for the HS2 rail route will be built near London Euston station. A recently discovered coffin showed the captain was buried on 23 July 1814. The dig began in October- one of 60 archaeological sites between London and Birmingham being explored prior to the construction of the Â£55bn high-speed rail line. It was known Captain Flinders was among the thousands of people buried at the site, which was built over when Euston station was expanded in the 19th Century but it was unclear whether his body or others would be able to be identified. Archaeologists were able to identify the remains of the explorer by a lead plate placed on top of his coffin The discovery so early in the dig has thrilled archaeologists who were not confident they would find Captain Flinders among the 40,000 people interred there, HS2 said. They were able to identify his remains by the lead breast plate placed on top of his coffin. This video can not be played How do you move the remains of 40,000 people? Captain Flinders, who was from Lincolnshire, made several significant journeys, notably as commander of HMS Investigator. In the ship he became the first known person to navigate around the entire coast of Australia, confirming it as a continent. He is also credited with giving Australia its name - although he was not the first to use the term, his work popularised its use. Iceland still selling own-brand palm oil Social media stars agree to declare ads How a nine-year-old exposed police for killing his family Hywel Griffith, BBC News Sydney correspondent You don't need to go far in Australia to find the name Flinders. Streets, stations, mountains, towns, a river, a reef and a university all carry the captain's moniker. But the man credited with mapping this vast country and identifying it as a continent also has a lesser-known legacy. Matthew Flinders also found time to write a biography of Trim, his ship's cat. Trim survived storms, a fall overboard and a shipwreck before, according to Captain Flinders, eventually being eaten by starving slaves in Mauritius. There is even a statue in Sydney to celebrate Trim, and the obvious affection shown to him by his intrepid, seafaring owner. The headstone marking his final resting place was removed following the expansion of Euston Station into part of the burial ground in the 1840s, and it was thought his remains had been lost. Over 200 archaeologists and specialists are working at the site beside Euston Station At the bicentenary of his death, a statue was unveiled by the Duke of Cambridge at Australia House andlater installed at Euston Station. Helen Wass, HS2 head of heritage, said: ""The discovery is an incredible opportunity for us to learn more about the life and remarkable achievements of this British navigator, hydrographer and scientist. ""Given the number of human remains at St James's, we weren't confident that we were going to find him. ""We'll now be able to study his skeleton to see whether life at sea left its mark and what more we can learn about him."" Captain Flinders will be reinterred with the buried population of St James's Gardens at a location to be announced, HS2 said.

"Warm conditions mean trees can absorb less CO2 say scientists Met Office researchers expect to record one of the biggest rises in atmospheric concentrations of CO2 in 2019. Every year, the Earth's natural carbon sinks such as forests soak up large amounts of CO2 produced by human activities. But in years when the tropical Pacific region is warmer like this year, trees and plants grow less and absorb smaller amounts of the gas. As a result, scientists say 2019 will see a much bigger CO2 rise than 2018. 'Tipping point' risk for Arctic hotspot The battle on the frontline of climate change Will insect-eating dogs help climate change? Since 1958, the research observatory at Mauna Loa in Hawaii, has been continuously monitoring and collecting data on the chemical composition of the atmosphere. In the years since they first started recording, the observatory has seen a 30% increase in the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere caused by emissions of fossil fuels and deforestation. Scientists argue that the increase would have been even larger without the ability of the forests, land and seas to soak up around half of the gas emitted by human activities. This ability however, varies with the seasons. Forecast COâ concentrations at Mauna Loa over 2019 (orange), along with previous forecast concentrations for 2016 (blue), 2017 (green), 2018 (pink) and Scripps Institute measurements (black). In the summer, CO2 levels in the atmosphere fall as the trees and plants soak up more of the carbon as they grow. In the winter, when they drop their leaves, they soak up less and atmospheric levels rise. But when temperatures are warmer and drier than normal, trees and plants grow less and absorb less.  This natural variation is compounded in years when there's anEl NiÃ±o event, which sees an upwelling of heat from the Pacific into the atmosphere. ""The warm sea surface conditions now will continue over the next few months and that will lead into the vegetation response,"" said Dr Chris Jones from the Met Office. ""Around the world this heat has different impacts. In some places, it's hotter and drier and you get more forest fires. In a tropical rainforest, for instance, you reduce the natural growth of the vegetation."" According to the Met Office, these limits on the ability to absorb CO2 will see a rise in concentrations this year of 2.75 parts per million, which is higher than the 2018 level. They are forecasting that average CO2 concentrations in 2019 will be 411ppm. Carbon dioxide concentration exceeded 400ppm for the first time in 2013. This year's predicted rise won't be as big as in the El NiÃ±o years of 2015-16 and 1997-98. However, there have only been increases similar to this year's about half a dozen times since records began. An image showing the 2015 El NiÃ±o with rising temperatures in the Pacific Researchers say the long-term trend is only going in one direction. ""The year-on-year increase of CO2 is getting steadily bigger as it has done throughout the whole of the 20th Century,"" said Dr Jones. ""What we are seeing for next year will be one of the biggest on record and it will certainly lead to the highest concentration of CO2."" Other researchers say the Met Office findings are worrying. ""The increases in CO2 are a function of our continued reliance on fossil fuels,"" said Dr Anna Jones, from the British Antarctic Survey (BAS). ""Some tempering in the rate of increase arises from the Earth's ability to absorb CO2 from the atmosphere, but that can change year-on-year as the Met Office forecast shows. ""What's critical, however, is that the persistent rise in atmospheric CO2 is entirely at odds with the ambition to limit global warming to 1.5C. We need to see a reduction in the rate of CO2 emissions, not an increase."" The Met Office scientists say that it doesn't always follow that a record CO2 concentration will lead to a record global temperature in 2019, as there are many natural factors that can impact the final figure. The researchers there are pleased that observations over the past four years show that their model is accurate. They believe it can be used in the future to help countries accurately attribute increases in emissions to their actions or to natural factors.

House sparrows saw massive declines between 1977 and 2008 Butsightings of two of the UK's most recognisable birds, blackbirds and robins, fell. Over the years, the survey has documented the boom in sightings of wood pigeons and long tailed tits, as well as influxes of bramblings and waxwings. The woodpigeon is the UK's largest and most common pigeon Choose a good spot. This could be your back garden, a local park, or any green space.

The parakeets are the UK's only naturalised parrot and are often found in flocks, numbering hundreds at a roost site. The tropical birds have managed to thrive in the UK - it's thought they were originally unwanted or escaped pets - and have been breeding for the last 40 years. They are mainly found in Greater London, but the species has been recorded in almost every county in England, and has reached Wales and the Scottish borders. However, they're very noisy, and the worry is that, as their numbers increase, they may become a problem for native fauna and fruit growers. Allow Instagram content?

"Captain Matthew Flinders is credited with naming Australia The remains of explorer Captain Matthew Flinders have been identified by archaeologists working on the HS2 project in a London burial ground. Captain Flinders led the first circumnavigation of Australia and is credited with naming the country. Some 61,000 skeletons will be removed from St James's Gardens, where the station for the HS2 rail route will be built near London Euston station. A recently discovered coffin showed the captain was buried on 23 July 1814. The dig began in October- one of 60 archaeological sites between London and Birmingham being explored prior to the construction of the Â£55bn high-speed rail line. It was known Captain Flinders was among the thousands of people buried at the site, which was built over when Euston station was expanded in the 19th Century but it was unclear whether his body or others would be able to be identified. Archaeologists were able to identify the remains of the explorer by a lead plate placed on top of his coffin The discovery so early in the dig has thrilled archaeologists who were not confident they would find Captain Flinders among the 40,000 people interred there, HS2 said. They were able to identify his remains by the lead breast plate placed on top of his coffin. This video can not be played How do you move the remains of 40,000 people? Captain Flinders, who was from Lincolnshire, made several significant journeys, notably as commander of HMS Investigator. In the ship he became the first known person to navigate around the entire coast of Australia, confirming it as a continent. He is also credited with giving Australia its name - although he was not the first to use the term, his work popularised its use. Iceland still selling own-brand palm oil Social media stars agree to declare ads How a nine-year-old exposed police for killing his family Hywel Griffith, BBC News Sydney correspondent You don't need to go far in Australia to find the name Flinders. Streets, stations, mountains, towns, a river, a reef and a university all carry the captain's moniker. But the man credited with mapping this vast country and identifying it as a continent also has a lesser-known legacy. Matthew Flinders also found time to write a biography of Trim, his ship's cat. Trim survived storms, a fall overboard and a shipwreck before, according to Captain Flinders, eventually being eaten by starving slaves in Mauritius. There is even a statue in Sydney to celebrate Trim, and the obvious affection shown to him by his intrepid, seafaring owner. The headstone marking his final resting place was removed following the expansion of Euston Station into part of the burial ground in the 1840s, and it was thought his remains had been lost. Over 200 archaeologists and specialists are working at the site beside Euston Station At the bicentenary of his death, a statue was unveiled by the Duke of Cambridge at Australia House andlater installed at Euston Station. Helen Wass, HS2 head of heritage, said: ""The discovery is an incredible opportunity for us to learn more about the life and remarkable achievements of this British navigator, hydrographer and scientist. ""Given the number of human remains at St James's, we weren't confident that we were going to find him. ""We'll now be able to study his skeleton to see whether life at sea left its mark and what more we can learn about him."" Captain Flinders will be reinterred with the buried population of St James's Gardens at a location to be announced, HS2 said.

"After months of negotiations, the UK and European Union finally agreed a deal that will define their future relationship, which comes into effect at 23.00GMT on 31 December. It has. The UK voted to leave the EU in 2016 and officially left the trading bloc - its nearest and biggest trading partner - on 31 January 2020. However, both sides agreed to keep many things the same until 31 December 2020, to allow enough time to agree to the terms of a new trade deal. It was a complex, sometimes bitter negotiation, but they finally agreed a deal on 24 December. The deal contains new rules for how the UK and EU will live, work and trade together. While the UK was in the EU, companies could buy and sell goods across EU borders without paying taxes and there were no limits on the amount of things which could be traded. Under the terms of the deal, that won't change on 1 January, but to be sure that neither side has an unfair advantage, both sides had to agree to some shared rules and standards on workers' rights, as well as many social and environmental regulations. You can read more detail on other aspects of the deal, including more on travel, fishing, and financial services,here. What's in the Brexit deal? Freedom to work and live between the UK and the EU also comes to an end, and in 2021, UK nationals will need a visa if they want to stay in the EU more than 90 days in a 180-day period. Northern Ireland will continue to follow many of the EU's rules in order to avoid a hardening of its border with the Republic of Ireland. This will mean however that new checks will be introduced on goods entering Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK. Now that it's no longer in the EU, the UK is free to set its own trade policy and can negotiate deals with other countries. Talks are being held with the US, Australia and New Zealand - countries that currently don't have free trade deals with the EU. UK leader Boris Johnson signed the deal after the document was flown to the UK from Brussels in an RAF plane There may not be new taxes to pay at the border, but there will be new paperwork, and the potential for it to cause delays is a serious concern. ""This is the biggest imposition of red tape that businesses have had to deal with in 50 years,"" according to William Bain from the British Retail Consortium. The UK says it will delay making most checks for six months, to allow people to get used to the new system, but the EU will be checking paperwork and carrying out checks from day one. So if businesses are not prepared, or do not fill in the new paperwork correctly, it could cause delays and backlogs at ports like Dover. The government has known about this for years, and has made plans to divert trade to other ports around the country and has built lorry parks in Kent, to avoid gridlock on the roads. It's difficult to predict what the scale of any disruption might be, but government minister Michael Gove has said that UK businesses should prepare for some ""bumpy moments"". Sadly, no. Decisions are still to be made on data sharing and on financial services, and the agreement on fishing only lasts five years. Also while the UK and EU have agreed to some identical rules now, they don't have to be identical in the future, and if one side takes exception to the changes, they can trigger a dispute, which could ultimately lead to tariffs (charges on imports) being imposed on some goods in the future. Expect the threat of disputes to be a new constant in UK-EU relations. The last few years have seen many words and phrases enter our lives. We haven't used them here, but politicians do use them. Here's what some of them mean: Transition period:The 11-month period following the UK's exit from the EU (finishing at the end of 2020), during which time the UK has followed EU rules, to allow leaders to make a deal. Free trade:Trade between two countries, where neither side charges taxes or duties on goods crossing borders. Level playing field:A set of rules to ensure that one country, or group of countries, doesn't have an unfair advantage over another. This can involve areas such as workers' rights and environmental standards. Free trade agreements like the Brexit deal often include level playing field measures. Tariff:A tax or duty to be paid on goods crossing borders.

"A key part of the Brexit negotiations has been the border that separates Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. The border is a matter of great political, security and diplomatic sensitivity in Ireland. Therefore the UK and EU agreed that whatever happens as a result of Brexit there should be no new physical checks or infrastructure at the frontier. This is where the controversial ""backstop"" comes in. At present, goods and services are traded between the two jurisdictions with few restrictions. That is because the UK and Ireland are part of the EU's single market and customs union, so products do not need to be inspected for customs or standards. But after Brexit, all that could change - the two parts of Ireland could be in different customs and regulatory regimes, which could mean products being checked at the border. The preference of both sides is to prevent this happening through a deep and comprehensive trade deal. However, the UK's ambition to leave the customs union and the single market, could make that very difficult. This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics. And if both sides couldn't reach agreement on a deal keeping the border as open as it is now - that's where the backstop would come in. So how might it it work? There are several options: This is what the EU originally proposed. It would involve Northern Ireland alone remaining in the EU's single market and customs union, leaving Great Britain (England, Scotland and Wales) free to strike trade deals. But the DUP - a Northern Ireland unionist party that propped up Theresa May's minority Conservative government - objected to this. It said it would see Northern Ireland treated differently and could threaten the union. Boris Johnson has alsospecifically ruled this out. After the DUP's objections, Mrs May agreed a backstop involving the whole of the UK retaining a very close relationship with the EU - staying in the customs union - for an indefinite period. It would also see Northern Ireland staying even more closely tied to some rules of the EU single market. These arrangements would apply unless and until both the EU and UK agree they are no longer necessary. This video can not be played Would you notice if you crossed the Irish border? (Video from 2017) The backstop would not apply if the UK left the EU without a deal but the potential problems with the border would remain. The backstop plan was agreed by UK-EU negotiators and formed part of Theresa May's withdrawal agreement in November 2018 (often referred to as the Brexit ""divorce deal""). It sparked a backlash from many Conservative MPs (and the DUP) at Westminster and several of her own ministers resigned in protest. Please upgrade your browser They feared that the backstop would be used to permanently trap the UK in the EU customs union, preventing the country from striking its own trade deals. Ultimately, her deal was voted down three times, leading to her resignation. Prime Minister Boris Johnson says he is committed to ""getting rid"" of the backstop, describing it as ""anti-democratic"". His government has instead proposed the idea of a ""single regulatory zone"" on the island of Ireland. That would mean Northern Ireland continuing to follow EU rules on animal health, food safety and manufactured goods. It would effectively mean a new regulatory border in the Irish Sea with checks and controls at ports. The DUP say they can accept this as long as there is a role for the Northern Ireland Assembly to give ongoing consent to these arrangements. On customs, the UK has said Northern Ireland must leave the EU customs union. However the Prime Minister believes checks at the Irish frontier can be avoided by instead having customs processes mainly at company premises. The EU is sceptical about this and the latest negotiations have focused largely on customs. Many Brexit supporters say what are known as ""alternative arrangements"" could be used to avoid checks at the border. The phrase is normally used to refer to technical or technological solutions. These include things like trusted traders schemes and using GPS to track lorries. The EU has committed to working on alternative arrangements but has said no systems which could solve the border problem are currently ""operational"".

"This video can not be played Alex Salmond speaking outside court said: ""Let me say at the outset, I am innocent of any criminality whatsoever."" Former Scottish first minister Alex Salmond has appeared in court charged with attempted rape and sexual assault. He faced a total of 14 charges at Edinburgh Sheriff Court, also including breach of the peace and indecent assault. The 64-year-old made no plea during the hearing and was released on bail. Outside court, Mr Salmond said he was ""innocent of any criminality"" and added that he would defend himself ""to the utmost"". Police had been investigating following a Scottish government inquiry into complaints of sexual harassment against Mr Salmond. Mr Salmond, who was first minister from 2007 to 2014, was interviewed by police on Wednesday. Alex Salmond arrived at Edinburgh Sheriff Court on Thursday to hear the charges made against him He arrived at the court shortly before 14:00 on Thursday for a short hearing, which took place in private. Mr Salmond was accused of two charges of attempted rape, nine of sexual assault, two of indecent assault and one breach of the peace. Speaking outside the court following the hearing, the former MP and MSP said: ""Now that these proceedings, criminal proceedings, are live it is important to respect the court. ""And therefore, the only thing I can say is I refute absolutely these allegations of criminality and I'll defend myself to the utmost in court."" No date has yet been fixed for the next hearing in the case. The news comes two weeks after Mr Salmond was at the Court of Session in Edinburgh, where the Scottish government conceded that its internal investigation of complaints against him was flawed. The former first minister had launched a judicial review against the government he once led over how it had handled its inquiry, saying he had been treated unfairly. That case was focused on the government's processes, not the substance of the complaints - which Mr Salmond has denied. Mr Salmond was twice leader of the SNP, but quit the party in 2018 after taking legal action against the government He was twice leader of the SNP, and led the party into government at Holyrood in 2007 Mr Salmond left office after the 2014 Scottish independence referendum, with his former deputy Nicola Sturgeon taking his place in Bute House He returned to Westminster as an MP the following year, but lost his Gordon seat in the snap election in 2017 Mr Salmond has since worked as a talk show host on Russian network RT He quit the SNP when launching his legal action against the Scottish government in 2018 Salmond: 'I am innocent of any criminality' Video, 00:00:36Salmond: 'I am innocent of any criminality' Watch Alex Salmond arrive at court.

"This video can not be played Amber Rudd said there were ""lots of moving parts"" in Westminster at the moment Cabinet minister Amber Rudd has told the BBC she is ""committed to making sure we avoid"" a no deal Brexit and would not rule out resigning over it. The work and pensions secretary said she was ""going to wait and see"" whether the prime minister allowed MPs a free vote on potential options next week. Labour MP Yvette Cooper has tabled an amendment to delay Brexit if no deal is reached by the end of February. MPs heavily rejected the deal Theresa May agreed with the EU last week. The UK is due to leave the EU at 23:00 GMT on 29 March and the prime minister has faced repeated calls to rule out the prospect of leaving without a deal, if no agreement can be reached. Stop playing to Brexit 'bad boys' says union chief Fresh referendum 'doesn't have enough MP support' UK will find trade difficult, says Irish PM She says it is not within the government's power to rule it out - but various backbench MPs will try to move amendments to postpone Brexit if no agreement can be reached, when the Commons votes on a way forward next Tuesday. This video can not be played WATCH: John McDonnell: PM trying to 'blackmail' MPs on Brexit Ms Rudd returned to the cabinet in November, less than seven months after quitting as home secretary in April 2018 over the Windrush scandal. She told the BBC's Newsnight that she wanted MPs to get a free vote on the various amendments - but would not say if she would resign her ministerial post to back an amendment from Labour's Yvette Cooper. The amendment would give time for a bill to suspend the Article 50 process for leaving the EU to the end of the year, if a new deal has not been agreed with Brussels by the end of February. Ms Rudd said the ""best outcome"" was for MPs to support Mrs May's deal and ""every day in Parliament we hear about MPs who voted against the withdrawal agreement who are reconsidering"". Pressed on whether she would quit to block no deal, she said: ""I think it's too early for anyone to make those sort of commitments because at the moment there is a lot of change going on. ""I have called for a free vote for the amendments on Tuesday and we'll see what position the government takes."" Meanwhile, Chancellor Philip Hammond told an audience of business people on Thursday: ""In the 2016 referendum, a promise was made to the majority who voted for Brexit - that they were voting for a more prosperous future. ""Not leaving would be seen as a betrayal of that referendum decision. ""But leaving without a deal would undermine our future prosperity, and would equally represent a betrayal of the promises that were made."" The chancellor, who like Ms Rudd campaigned for a Remain vote during the 2016 EU referendum, said: ""The only sustainable solution is a negotiated settlement with the EU."" Please upgrade your browser Labour's shadow chancellor John McDonnell said: ""The chancellor must now surely consider his position in the government. ""Philip Hammond's comments today demonstrate he has acknowledged the damage a no-deal Brexit would do to our economy, jobs and living standards.

It comes as aerospace giant Airbuswarns that it could move its wing-building operations out of the UKif no Brexit deal is reached. Jaguar Land Roveralso announced it would extend its annual April shutdownin car production, because of uncertainties around Brexit. And Business Minister Richard Harrington also spoke out against a no-deal Brexit on Thursday saying: ""Crashing out is a disaster for businessâ¦ Airbus is correct to say it publicly and I'm delighted they have done so."" Later Airbus senior vice president Katherine Bennett was asked on Sky News whether the government had put the company up to issue warnings about the consequences of a no-deal Brexit. She said: ""No, the government didn't. The government have been talking to us and other industry representatives all the time, of course, and we've given them lots of information about the potential impacts. ""But they did say 'could you make sure that you make clear the potential impact of a no deal?', and we are happy to do that because no deal is potentially going to be catastrophic for us."" Theresa May met union leaders on Thursday as she continues to seek support for her Brexit deal, ahead of a crucial Commons vote on Tuesday. Last week the withdrawal deal negotiated with the EU was rejected by MPs by a historic margin -  432 votes to 202. The prime minister is hoping to tweak her deal to address concerns about the ""backstop"" among her own backbenchers and Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party, which she relies on to keep her in power, ahead of another vote on her proposed way forward next Tuesday. The backstop is the ""insurance policy"" in the withdrawal deal, intended to ensure that whatever else happens, there will be no return to a visible border between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic after the UK leaves the EU. But it has proved controversial with many MPs on her own side who argue it keeps Northern Ireland too closely aligned with the EU, and that the UK could be permanently trapped in the arrangement. A guide to MPs' Brexit amendments However as well as Yvette Cooper's amendment, her Labour colleague, Rachel Reeves, has also tabled an amendment to extend Article 50. Other amendments would ask the government to consider a range of options over six full days in Parliament before the March deadline, to set up a ""Citizens' Assembly"" to give the public more say or to insist on ""an expiry date to the backstop"". Plans by a group of Tory and Labour MPs to table an amendment on another EU referendum have been dropped, afterthey admitted they didn't have sufficient backing from MPs, although the Lib Dems will be tabling an amendment calling for a ""People's Vote"". It will be up to Speaker John Bercow to select amendments to put to the vote.

"This video can not be played David Solomon warns of Brexit investment hit The new chief executive of Goldman Sachs says that a ""difficult"" Brexit will negatively affect its investment plans in the UK. David Solomon told the BBC that while there has been a frozen headcount in the UK, the bank has been adding staff in the EU over the last two years. The outcome of Brexit would affect decisions about Goldman's people and resources, he said. The Wall Street giant employs 6,000 people in the UK. Speaking at the World Economic Forum, in Davos, Mr Solomon said: ""If this [Brexit] is resolved in a difficult way, or in a hard way, I do think it'll have an impact on where we invest in where we put people. ""All these things ultimately have an impact on the investment decisions and the business decisions that all of us as business leaders make."" Full coverage of Davos 2019,external 'Significant disruption' from no deal Of Goldman's UK staff, a few - in the dozens - have been asked to move to locations elsewhere in Europe. However, the bank has added hundreds of staff to offices in Frankfurt, Paris, Stockholm, Milan and Madrid. Please upgrade your browser While Brexit is a concern for the bank, it is not top of its list of worries. That spot goes to the fraught relationship between the world's two largest economies - the US and China. While some see the US as the aggressor in the trade war with China, Mr Solomon has sympathy with Donald Trump's ambitions to reset the rules. ""I think the administration has it right. I think there have been imbalances in the way the US and China have dealt with each other, particularly the openness of China's had with respect to US business. ""We want to see a level playing field and we want to see our technology and our investment over a long period of time protected,"" Mr Solomon told the BBC. He said he hoped that the US and China could resolve their differences by March - the date that the US is planning to introduce a new wave of higher tariffs on imports from China. Mr Solomon speaks for many at this year's World Economic Forum. The chatter in the congress hall, the receptions and the restaurants, is focused on the US and China, and whether the trade tensions between the economic superpowers could tip the world into a serious slowdown. The Goldman boss said he didn't think a global recession was imminent, but he said there was a 15% chance of a downturn in the US this year, and a 50% chance next year. Neither Mr Solomon, nor anyone else in Davos, is prepared to make such a precise estimate of the chances of the no deal Brexit that most businesses here fear. But it is certainly fair to say that he and most business leaders in Davos think it's becoming less likely.
