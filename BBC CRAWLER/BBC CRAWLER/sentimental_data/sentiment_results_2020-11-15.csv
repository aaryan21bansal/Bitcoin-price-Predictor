"Most of the debilitating effects of statins are not caused by the drug, but by people believing it will make them sick, a UK study suggests. The phenomenon is known as the ""nocebo effect"" and may account for 90% of the ill health associated with the cholesterol-lowering drugs. The British Heart Foundation said the results were undeniable. The Imperial College London researchers hope the findings will help more people stay on statins. The drugs are one of the most prescribed in the UK. Nearly eight million people taken them to lower their cholesterol and in turn reduce the risk of heart attacks and stroke. However, up to a fifth of people stop taking them due to side-effects such as muscle aches, fatigue, feeling sick and joint pain. Reality Check: Who should take statins? More over-75s 'should take statins' Statins 'don't work well for one in two' The nocebo effect - when expecting a drug to make you worse, genuinely does - has been seen before in medicine. It is thought to explainthe high number of people who think they have penicillin allergies when tests suggest otherwise,external. The statin study, which took place at Hammersmith Hospital, focused on 60 patients who had all come off the drugs in the past due to severe side effects. They were given 12 bottles - four contained a month's worth of statins, four a month's worth of dummy pills and four were empty. Every day for a year they would score, from zero to 100, how bad their symptoms were. The study showed an average score of: 8 in those taking no tablets 15.4 while taking dummy pills 16.3 while taking statins The Imperial researchers said 90% of the severity of their symptoms was present when the volunteers were taking dummy pills they thought could be a statin. ""The side effects are mainly caused by act of taking tablets, not what is in them,"" Dr James Howard, one of the researchers told BBC News. He added: ""It is crazy when you think about it, to most people it is complete incongruous."" Symptoms were so bad that people had to stop taking the tablets on 71 occasions, including 31 times while they were just taking the dummy pill, during the course of the study. ""Our patients were really suffering, patients are not making it up,"" Dr Howard said. But does it matter either way? Whether it is nocebo effect or the chemicals in the statin themselves, the net result is some people find the drugs intolerable. ""I think it matters a lot,"" Dr Howard said. He said talking the results through with patients meant half of them were able to restart their statins. The nocebo effect is the opposite of the more familiar placebo effect, in which people feel better after being given a therapy, even if there is nothing in it. The exact reason why statins produce a nocebo effect is unknown. The suspicion is they have achieved a self-fulfilling destiny with media reports, GPs and cardiologists warning of the side-effects of statins. ""If you stopped a man in the street and asked how do you feel about an aspirin or a statin a day, I think people would be much more positive about the aspirin,"" Dr Howard said. The study is being published in the New England Journal of Medicine and presented at the American Heart Association Conference. Prof Sir Nilesh Samani, the medical director at the British Heart Foundation, said: ""These results undeniably show that statins are not responsible for many of the side effects attributed to them. ""Decades of evidence have proven that statins save lives and they should be the first port of call for individuals at high risk of heart attack and stroke.""

"This video can not be played Blast off: Watch the SpaceX rocket head into space Four astronauts - three from the US and one from Japan - have launched from Florida on a mission to the International Space Station (ISS). The crew rode to orbit in a rocket and capsule provided by the SpaceX company. It's only the second time the firm has supplied the service. The US space agency Nasa has said it is now entering a new era in which routine astronaut journeys to low-Earth orbit are being conducted by commercial providers. The four individuals making their way up to the ISS are the Americans Michael Hopkins, Victor Glover and Shannon Walker, and the highly experienced Japanese space agency (Jaxa) astronaut Soichi Noguchi. By participating in this mission, Noguchi becomes only the third person in history to leave Earth in three different types of space vehicle, having previously flown on Soyuz and shuttle hardware. What is the SpaceX Crew Dragon? How astronaut transportation went commercial Orbital apparel: Evolution of the spacesuit The traditional ""walk-out"": The suited crew waved to family and friends The crew's Falcon rocket and Dragon capsule left the pad at the Kennedy Space Center at 19:27 local time (00:27 GMT, Monday). It took 12 minutes for the Falcon to get the Dragon into the right part of the sky and drop it off. ""Well done, that was one heck of a ride,"" crew commander Mike Hopkins radioed down to controllers. ""Congratulations to everyone. Resilience is in orbit."" ""Resilience"" is the name the astronauts have given their capsule. The ship will use its own thrusters to complete the rest of the journey up to the station. A docking with the orbiting platform is set for about 0400 GMT on Tuesday. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

When the team arrives, it will join Nasa's Kate Rubins and Russian space agency (Roscosmos) cosmonauts Sergey Ryzhikov and Sergey Kud-Sverchkov. Having seven people on the 410km-high outpost will triple the amount of science that can be performed in its special microgravity environment. The crew was driven down to the launch pad in a convoy of Tesla electric cars SpaceX has signed contracts with Nasa valued in excess of $3bn (Â£2.3bn) to develop, test and fly an astronaut taxi service. As part of this relationship, the company rana demonstration mission in Mayin which astronauts Doug Hurley and Bob Behnken were taken to the station and then returned safely to Earth. The contracted arrangements also call for six ""operational"", or routine, missions - this flight being the first. ""The big milestone here is that we are now moving away from development and test and into operational flights. And in fact this operational flight was licensed by the Federal Aviation Administration. So this is a truly a commercial launch,"" commented Nasa Administrator Jim Bridenstine. Nasa has a similar deal with the Boeing aerospace company, although its service is more than a year behind SpaceX. The agency says its new model of contracting out transportation to low-Earth orbit is saving billions of dollars in procurement costs. It intends to use these economies to fund its Moon and Mars ambitions. To that end, Nasa is close to testing the giant new rocket it has commissioned to take astronauts back to the lunar surface, a goal it hopes to attain in 2024, or soon after. Nasa's new 'megarocket' set for critical tests Nasa's giant SLS rocket: A guide Hopkins, Glover, Walker and Noguchi will stay on the ISS for six months. Just before they return to Earth, they'll be joined aloft by another SpaceX-launched crew for a brief handover. Indeed, the coming year is going to be very busy for the Californian service provider with plenty of trips up to the station being made by both its crewed and cargo-only versions of Dragon. ""In the next 15 months, we should be flying roughly seven Dragon missions. And this mission represents the initiation of a Dragon in orbit continuously - knocking on wood - and certainly is really the beginning of a new era in human spaceflight,"" said SpaceX's Gwynne Shotwell. The company president was in attendance at Kennedy, carrying out media duties in place of founder and CEO Elon Musk who is said to be suffering a mild case of Covid. A dramatic shot of the Merlin engines firing at the base of the Falcon rocket Nasa retired its winged space shuttles in 2011. In the intervening years, it's been buying seats for its astronauts on Russian Soyuz vehicles. This purchase option will now close in favour of the new American-sourced taxis. But US astronauts will continue to go to the station on Soyuz from time to time - it's just that no money will change hands. Instead, Russian cosmonauts will get flights in the American capsules in exchange. Soichi Noguchi has now flown in a SpaceX Dragon, a Soyuz capsule and a space shuttle The new crew will have at least four spacewalks to perform in their time at the station. In one of those walks, they will install the first significant UK industrial contribution to the platform. This is theColKa communications terminal. Made by MDA UK, the radio equipment will enable astronauts to connect with scientists and family on Earth at home broadband speeds. ColKa will be fixed to the exterior of Europe's ISS research module, Columbus. The UK participates on the station through its membership of the European Space Agency, an intergovernmental organisation that is a separate legal entity to the European Union. Will the UK have a seat on a space taxi? Libby Jackson, UK Space Agency The UK participates in the International Space Station, because the UK Space Agency exploration programme is part of the European Space Agency programme. We already have British scientists who are able to use the facilities on the ISS. And there are some experiments in development now to be carried out aboard the space station in the coming years. One, called the BioAsteroid project, run by the University of Edinburgh, will investigate how gravity affects the interaction between microbes and rock in reduced gravity. Astronauts on these space taxis will be taking these UK-led experiments to and from the space station. And much of the science can actually be operated remotely from the ground. We may well also see British astronauts flying on this vehicle in the future, too.

"Ant and Dec said the the show would feel ""reassuringly familiar"" despite the new location Ant and Dec told campmates ""things are going to be a bit different this year"" as the latest series of I'm A Celebrity Get Me Out Of Here launched on Sunday. This year's series is taking place in Gwrych Castle in North Wales instead of the Australian jungle due to Covid-19 restrictions. Sir Mo Farah, Vernon Kay and Beverley Callard are among the new campmates. ""I can't tell you how excited we are to see you all here together finally,"" said Dec. ""Welcome to the castle."" ""Things are going to be a bit different this year,"" continued Ant. ""There's no jungle obviously, there's no dunny, there's a privy [toilet] and I can guarantee you there's absolutely no chance of sunbathing."" Dec added: ""Some things will stay exactly the same. Some things will be reassuringly familiar. So you will live on a diet of rice and beans and you'll do trials to win food for the camp."" Sunday's launch episode drew an average audience of 10.9 million, almost two million more than the audience that tuned into the Strictly Come Dancing results show on BBC One earlier that evening. That was more than the overnight audience of 10 million recorded for last year's launch episode - though that figure rose to 13.17 million once on-demand and catch-up views were taken into account. The celebrities were split into two groups of five for the opening challenge The other campmates this series include former EastEnders star Shane Richie, Paralympic champion Hollie Arnold, and journalist Victoria Derbyshire. Actress Jessica Plummer, Radio 1 DJ Jordan North, podcaster Giovanna Fletcher and former Strictly pro dancer AJ Pritchard complete the line-up. The episode opened with the 10 celebrities split into two groups of five, with one group meeting at the top of a cliff and the other at the bottom. Those at the top then had to start abseiling down the cliff to collect the team's rucksacks, which were padlocked half way down the cliff side. North was so nervous about the challenge he was sick before it began. ""I've only been here 5 minutes and I'm puking up already,"" he said. Allow Twitter content?

Later in the episode, the 10 celebrities were told they would all take part in the first trial of the series, titled The Gates To Hell. The challenge saw each of the campmates locked in 10 adjacent chambers. The team then had to pass gold stars, each worth a meal for the camp, from one end to the other - while having cockroaches, maggots and crickets dropped on them. The group managed to move seven of the 10 gold stars to the end of the line. Derbyshire said she felt ""ecstatic that we got so many stars and that it's all over"", but North described the experience as ""absolutely horrific"". After the challenge was over, Callard discovered there were still critters in her pockets and said: ""Oh my god this is my worst nightmare!"" This year's series is taking place in Gwrych Castle in North Wales The campmates were also seen exploring their new home, with several of them less than impressed by the castle's washroom. ""Its minging, it needs a really good clean. Well I'm sorry but no. My hair. I will look like I've had Donald Trump's hairdresser,"" joked Callard. Reflecting on the new location, Kay said: ""There are certain things that Australia would've provided that Wales doesn't - a tan, and the opportunity to wear budgie smugglers."" On social media, viewers enjoyed poking fun at the latest round of celebrities and their reactions to the first challenges. Several Twitter usersmade light of Arnold,externalintroducing herself as ""Hollie Arnold MBE"" when she met her fellow campmates. Others enjoyed Plummer's struggle to remember where her group Neon Jungle's single had charted, confusing the Scottish singles chartwith the overall UK chart.,external Giovanna Fletcher's husband Tom, from the band McFly, got particularly nervous watching the opening challenge,tweeting:,external""Did Shane Richie just drop my wife off a cliff?!""

The new setting broadly went down well with viewers, withTV critic Emma Bullimore writing,external: ""Wales looks gorgeous, it's a great group of celebs and Ant and Dec are on good form. I'd be happy for them never to go back to Australia."" Radio 1 DJGreg James agreed:,external""I think it's gonna be better in Wales and won't ever go back to Australia."" ""It wasn't what ITV bosses had planned but the early signs for this revamped, relocated series were promising,"" wroteMichael Hogan in the Telegraph,external. ""The new castle setting was telegenic and atmospheric."" ""Who needs the Australian jungle when you've a draughty tower in Wales?""wrote The Independent's Ed Power,external. ""Despite the new location and the fact it's being shot in winter, I'm A Celeb 2020 was exceedingly I'm A Celebrity."" North's reaction to the first challenge ledseveral viewers to suggest,externalthe public would inevitably vote for him to do the majority of the trials this series. And, sure enough, the episode concluded with North and Richie finding out they would face the next bushtucker trial. This series will run for three weeks, with one winner ultimately being crowned the king or queen of the castle - instead of jungle. By Steven McIntosh, entertainment reporter It took a minute to acclimatise to I'm A Celebrity's new look as Ant and Dec welcomed viewers to North Wales, but it wasn't long before it began feeling like business as usual. Just like Love Island's move from Spain to South Africafor its winter series, the location might be different, but it fundamentally remains the same show with the same basic format underneath. All the usual I'm A Celebrity building blocks are in place - it's already clear there will still be exhausted and terrified celebrities doing bushtucker trials while Ant and Dec hold the show together (and try not to laugh at them too much).

This year's line-up is strong and the group supported each other well during the first challenge, with Ant telling them they ""worked well as a team"". This could end up being one of the most successful series of I'm A Celebrity yet for ITV. The current lockdown restrictions haveresulted in a major ratings boostfor programmes like Strictly Come Dancing as people stay at home.

"The government is set to revise its proposals for controversial planning reforms in England, after new housing targets prompted a backlash amongst some senior Conservative MPs. Ministers have proposed updating the formula for where to build houses to meet its aim of delivering more homes. But some said the ""mutant algorithm"" would fail to ""level up"" the North and see the South ""concreted over"". Critics of the proposal include former Prime Minister Theresa May. She said the new formula ""does not guarantee a single extra home being built"". May attacks 'ill-conceived' planning reforms Government won't cut 300,000 homes target, says housing secretary Johnson defends 'long overdue' planning overhaul In the House of Commons, Housing Secretary Robert Jenrick said he would make a statement on revised plans ""in the weeks ahead"". He told MPs the Covid crisis was causing the ""most substantial change to city centres and town centres since the Second World War and that does give us pause for reflection"". The government would ""consider what those opportunities will be for the repurposing of offices into residential, for turning retail into mixed use and that will, I think, lead us to a different approach to distributing housing numbers across the country,"" he said. The new formula was proposed as part of wider government planning reforms. They include a target to build 300,000 new homes across England each year by the mid-2020s, with the formula providing a rough estimate to local councils on how many need to be built in their communities. Mr Jenrick has said local authorities will then be expected to come forward with potential sites for new buildings - taking into account constraints, such as areas protected by the green belt. But several Tory MPs have expressed concern that the government's plan could mean more homes in rural areas and in the South East, rather than the North and Midlands. While the 300,000 target remains ""undiminished"", the government says it has listened to the feedback of critical MPs and ministers are looking to ""rebalance"" the formula. It is thought the focus will shift towards building more homes in the North and Midlands, and in urban areas or city centres - where the coronavirus pandemic has potentially accelerated a longer-term drop in demand for office and retail spaces. It does not mean there will not still be new homes built in the South East. Former Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt, who met Mr Jenrick this week to raise his concerns about the formula, thanked his colleague on Twitter for ""listening to the concerns of me and many other MPs"". He added: ""We support your desire for more houses to help young people get on the housing ladder and will work with you to make sure a revised algorithm achieves that."" Conservative MP for the Isle of Wight Bob Seely, who led calls for a change to the plan - and secured a recent Commons debate on the issue - told the BBC he also welcomed the fact the government was willing to listen to the ""strength of feeling and depth of concern"" backbenchers had. But he said it now had to work with MPs and ""rethink"" as the UK needed ""levelling up, not concreting out."" Former Environment Secretary Theresa Villiers also said the change in approach from government was ""encouraging"", but ""a few tweaks are not enough"". She said: ""We need radical change to the proposal if we're to ensure that this algorithm doesn't lead to unacceptable overdevelopment."" This video can not be played Boris Johnson has defended his proposals for overhauling the planning system. Meanwhile, sources from the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government have also confirmed the department is looking to move a ""proportion"" of its operations to the West Midlands, with Wolverhampton understood to be the preferred location. This would involve moving ministerial offices and senior officials, although ministers would still spend time in Westminster. Next year has been described as a ""ball park"" timeline for the move.

"Police officers stood at the entrance to the church's Mount Zion Hall building, stopping people from entering Police halted a baptism service after about 30 worshippers gathered in breach of national lockdown restrictions. Regan King, lead pastor at The Angel Church, Islington, defended his decision to hold the service, saying it served ""the greater good"". The pastor agreed to hold a brief ""socially distanced outdoor gathering in the church courtyard"" after officers halted the service. Four officers stood at the entrance stopping people from entering. Undercurrent restrictionsweddings and baptisms are not allowed in England. Funerals can be attended by a maximum of 30 people. Lead pastor Regan King said he held the baptism because he ""served a greater good"" Mr King, 28, said he wanted to hold the baptism as it was providing ""an essential service"". He said: ""We were told not to have a baptism and police began to block people from entering the church, so we decided to make other arrangements."" Asked why he had decided to breach the restrictions, Mr King said: ""Because I believe we serve a greater good. ""This is an essential service that we provide. ""It's about loving our neighbour, and you can talk with a number of people here who are extremely vulnerable, homeless or on the verge of being very isolated."" The church held a socially distanced outdoor service nearby Two police vans and a police car parked outside the church's hall.

"Fifteen countries have formed the world's largest trading bloc, covering nearly a third of the global economy. The Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) is made up of 10 Southeast Asian countries, as well as South Korea, China, Japan, Australia and New Zealand. The pact is seen as an extension of China's influence in the region. The deal excludes the US, which withdrew from a rival Asia-Pacific trade pact in 2017. President Donald Trumppulled his country out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP)shortly after taking office. Negotiations over the new RCEP deal began in 2012 and it was finally signed on Sunday on the sidelines of a meeting of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean). The RCEP isn't as comprehensive and doesn't cut tariffs as deeply as the TPP's successor. But many analysts think RCEP's sheer size makes it more significant. ""Its membership includes a larger group of nations, notably reflecting the membership of China, which considerably boosts the total Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of RCEP members,"" according to Rajiv Biswas, Asia Pacific chief economist for analyst firm IHS Markit. While China already has a number of bilateral trade agreements, this is the first time it has signed up to a regional multilateral trade pact. Fifteen countries have formed the new trading bloc For starters, leaders hope that the pact will help to spur recovery from the coronavirus pandemic. ""Under the current global circumstances, the fact the RCEP has been signed after eight years of negotiations brings a ray of light and hope amid the clouds,"" said Chinese Premier Li Keqiang. Longer-term, Mr Li described the agreement as ""a victory of multilateralism and free trade"". India was also part of the negotiations, but it pulled out last year over concerns that lower tariffs could hurt local producers. Signatories of the deal said the door remained open for India to join in the future. Members of the RCEP make up nearly a third of the world's population and account for 29% of global gross domestic product. The new free trade bloc will be bigger than both the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement and the European Union. By Tim McDonald, BBC News, Singapore The RCEP is expected to eliminate a range of tariffs on imports within 20 years. It also includes provisions on intellectual property, telecommunications, financial services, e-commerce and professional services. But it's possible the new ""rules of origin"" - which officially define where a product comes from - will have the biggest impact. Already many member states have free trade agreements (FTA) with each other, but there are limitations. ""The existing FTAs can be very complicated to use compared to RCEP,"" said Deborah Elms from the Asian Trade Centre. Businesses with global supply chains might face tariffs even within an FTA because their products contain components that are made elsewhere. A product made in Indonesia that contains Australian parts, for example, might face tariffs elsewhere in the Asean free trade zone. Under RCEP, parts from any member nation would be treated equally, which might give companies in RCEP countries an incentive to look within the trade region for suppliers. Read more about the Asian trade mega-pact The Peterson Institute for International Economics estimates the deal could increase global national income by $186bn annually by 2030 and add 0.2% to the economy of its member states. However, some analysts think the deal is likely to benefit China, Japan and South Korea more than other member states. ""The economic benefits of the deal might only be marginal for South East Asia, but there are some interesting trade and tariff dynamics to watch for North East Asia,"" said Nick Marro at the Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU). But it could be some time before any country sees the benefits, because six Asean nations and three other nations have to ratify it before it takes effect. Mr Marro thinks it could be a slow process.

"Most of the debilitating effects of statins are not caused by the drug, but by people believing it will make them sick, a UK study suggests. The phenomenon is known as the ""nocebo effect"" and may account for 90% of the ill health associated with the cholesterol-lowering drugs. The British Heart Foundation said the results were undeniable. The Imperial College London researchers hope the findings will help more people stay on statins. The drugs are one of the most prescribed in the UK. Nearly eight million people taken them to lower their cholesterol and in turn reduce the risk of heart attacks and stroke. However, up to a fifth of people stop taking them due to side-effects such as muscle aches, fatigue, feeling sick and joint pain. Reality Check: Who should take statins? More over-75s 'should take statins' Statins 'don't work well for one in two' The nocebo effect - when expecting a drug to make you worse, genuinely does - has been seen before in medicine. It is thought to explainthe high number of people who think they have penicillin allergies when tests suggest otherwise,external. The statin study, which took place at Hammersmith Hospital, focused on 60 patients who had all come off the drugs in the past due to severe side effects. They were given 12 bottles - four contained a month's worth of statins, four a month's worth of dummy pills and four were empty. Every day for a year they would score, from zero to 100, how bad their symptoms were. The study showed an average score of: 8 in those taking no tablets 15.4 while taking dummy pills 16.3 while taking statins The Imperial researchers said 90% of the severity of their symptoms was present when the volunteers were taking dummy pills they thought could be a statin. ""The side effects are mainly caused by act of taking tablets, not what is in them,"" Dr James Howard, one of the researchers told BBC News. He added: ""It is crazy when you think about it, to most people it is complete incongruous."" Symptoms were so bad that people had to stop taking the tablets on 71 occasions, including 31 times while they were just taking the dummy pill, during the course of the study. ""Our patients were really suffering, patients are not making it up,"" Dr Howard said. But does it matter either way? Whether it is nocebo effect or the chemicals in the statin themselves, the net result is some people find the drugs intolerable. ""I think it matters a lot,"" Dr Howard said. He said talking the results through with patients meant half of them were able to restart their statins. The nocebo effect is the opposite of the more familiar placebo effect, in which people feel better after being given a therapy, even if there is nothing in it. The exact reason why statins produce a nocebo effect is unknown. The suspicion is they have achieved a self-fulfilling destiny with media reports, GPs and cardiologists warning of the side-effects of statins. ""If you stopped a man in the street and asked how do you feel about an aspirin or a statin a day, I think people would be much more positive about the aspirin,"" Dr Howard said. The study is being published in the New England Journal of Medicine and presented at the American Heart Association Conference. Prof Sir Nilesh Samani, the medical director at the British Heart Foundation, said: ""These results undeniably show that statins are not responsible for many of the side effects attributed to them. ""Decades of evidence have proven that statins save lives and they should be the first port of call for individuals at high risk of heart attack and stroke.""

"Ant and Dec said the the show would feel ""reassuringly familiar"" despite the new location Ant and Dec told campmates ""things are going to be a bit different this year"" as the latest series of I'm A Celebrity Get Me Out Of Here launched on Sunday. This year's series is taking place in Gwrych Castle in North Wales instead of the Australian jungle due to Covid-19 restrictions.

Sunday's launch episode drew an average audience of 10.9 million, almost two million more than the audience that tuned into the Strictly Come Dancing results show on BBC One earlier that evening. That was more than the overnight audience of 10 million recorded for last year's launch episode - though that figure rose to 13.17 million once on-demand and catch-up views were taken into account. The celebrities were split into two groups of five for the opening challenge The other campmates this series include former EastEnders star Shane Richie, Paralympic champion Hollie Arnold, and journalist Victoria Derbyshire. Actress Jessica Plummer, Radio 1 DJ Jordan North, podcaster Giovanna Fletcher and former Strictly pro dancer AJ Pritchard complete the line-up.

"The Prince of Wales has spoken of the ""enduring connections"" between the UK and Germany as negotiators prepare for post-Brexit trade talks to continue. Prince Charles said though politicians were discussing the ""shape"" of the countries' relationship, their ""fundamental bond"" would remain strong. His wife, Camilla, has joined him on their first official overseas visit since the start of the Covid pandemic. Earlier, they attended a wreath-laying ceremony at a memorial in Berlin. Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall are the first members of the Royal Family to attend the ceremony at the Bundestag, the German parliament, in Berlin, marking the country's National Day of Mourning for victims of war. The prince told those gathered: ""The United Kingdom has chosen a future outside the European Union, and the relationship between our countries is evolving once again. ""Its shape is a matter negotiated between our governments and its essence is defined by the enduring connections between our people. ""It is, therefore, my heartfelt belief that the fundamental bond between us will remain strong: we will always be friends, partners and allies. ""As our countries begin this new chapter in our long history, let us reaffirm our bond for the years ahead."" The speech comes 75 years after the end of World War Two and as post-Brexit trade talksare reaching their crucial final stages. This video can not be played Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall are visiting Berlin to commemorate Germanyâs National Day of Mourning Referring to the English poet John Donne, who wrote that ""no man is an island"", the heir to the throne said: ""One might equally submit that no country is really an island either, other than in the wholly literal sense. ""Our histories bind us tightly together and our destinies, although each our own to forge, are interdependent to a considerable degree."" Earlier on Sunday, Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall were welcomed to Germany by President Frank-Walter Steinmeier and his wife Elke Budenbender on the steps of the Bellevue Palace in Berlin. The four then travelled to the Neue Wache Central Memorial, dedicated to victims of war and tyranny, where a wreath had been laid on behalf of the prince in front of a sculpture titled Mother With Her Dead Son. The sculpture was designed by German artist Kathe Kollwitz in memory of her own son who died in World War One.

"With social distancing restrictions ending in England and easing further in Scotland on 19 July, good ventilation will remain very important in avoiding Covid. For months we've been told to wash our hands and maintain social distancing to beat the virus. But scientists and engineers say we also need to think about the air we breathe inside buildings. Good ventilation matters in five ways. When you walk into a room and the air feels stale, something is wrong with the ventilation. Not enough fresh air is being introduced, which increases your chances of getting infected by coronavirus. Recent research shows that in confined spaces there can be ""airborne transmission"" of the virus - with tiny virus particles lingering in the air. According toworkplace regulations set up before the pandemic,external, everyone should get 10 litres of fresh air every second, and that matters more than ever now. So if a place seems stuffy, just turn around and leave, saysDr Hywel Davies,external, technical director of the Chartered Institution of Building Services Engineers. He says that it's vital to have a flow of clean air: ""If you've got someone who's infected in a building, and you're bringing in plenty of outside air, you're diluting whatever infectious material they're giving off. You're reducing the risk of other people becoming infected."" From offices to shops, air conditioning is welcome on hot days - but check the type of unit. The simplest is a slender white box mounted on walls or ceilings, known as a split air conditioner. This draws in air from a room, chills it and then blows it back out again. A split air conditioner In other words, it's recirculating the air. This is no problem for a quick visit but may be a risk over a period of hours. Astudy of a restaurant in China,externalblamed this type of air conditioner for spreading the virus. One customer was ""pre-symptomatic"" - in other words, he was infected but did not realise because he had yet to develop symptoms. Scientists reckon he released the virus as he breathed and talked, and it was pushed around the room by swirling air currents from the units on the wall. The result was that nine other people became infected. Dr Davies points again to the importance of fresh air: ""If there had been a good supply of outside air, very likely fewer people would have become infected - if any."" In a modern building where the windows are sealed, how can you get enough fresh air? You're relying on a ventilation system in which stale air is extracted from the rooms and piped to an air handling unit, often on the roof. A rooftop air conditioning unit There, fresh air can be pulled in from outside and mixed with the old inside air, before being sent back into the building. Given the risk of coronavirus infection, the professional advice is to maximise the fresh supply. ""Having 100% outside air or close to 100% is a good thing,"" says Prof Cath Noakes of the University of Leeds and chair of the environmental panel of the government's SAGE advisers, speaking in a personal capacity. ""The more fresh air, the less you're running the risk of recirculating the virus through the building."" The precise mix is decided by the building's managers, who may be working for the owners or the tenants.  . The drawback to running 100% fresh air is the cost - the incoming air has to be heated in winter and cooled in summer, all of which requires energy. A modern ventilation system will have filters but these are not fool-proof. In the US, researchers investigating the Oregon Health & Science University Hospital found that traces of coronavirus were trapped by the filters but some had somehow slipped through. Prof Kevin van den Wymelenberg, who led the project, believes that swabbing the filters could reveal if there's someone infected working in a building. In South Korea, a call centre on the 11th floor of an office building saw one person infect more than 90 others. If the filters had been checked more frequently, the presence of the virus might have been spotted sooner. Prof van den Wymelenberg says data from filters can ""show us where to punch and when to punch"" in tackling infections. Talk to any expert in the field and they will say that fresh air is the key. But one specialist in modelling the movement of air says it's not that simple. Nick Wirth used to design Formula 1 racing cars, and now advises supermarkets and food-processing companies on how to manage air flow to keep people safe. He worries that if someone sitting beside an open window turns out to be infectious, they could shed virus to others downwind. ""If you open a window, where is the air going to go?"" he asks. ""We don't want people in a direct line of that airflow. ""More fresh air in general is better but if it's flowing horizontally and full of virus it could have unintended consequences."" I put this scenario to Prof Cath Noakes. She says the benefits of plentiful fresh air diluting the virus will outweigh any risks. An open window might lead to more people receiving the virus but in smaller, less risky amounts, in her view. It's no surprise there are disagreements - there's a lot we still don't know about the virus. But the air we breathe is bound to be part of any effort to make buildings safer.

"Boris Johnson is self-isolating after meeting an MP who later tested positive for Covid-19. The prime minister said he was contacted by NHS Test and Trace on Sunday but is not showing symptoms. Mr Johnson on Thursday spent about 35 minutes with Ashfield MP Lee Anderson who has since tested positive. The news came as No 10 said Mr Johnson would make ""critical announcements"" about coronavirus and ""levelling up"" the UK over the coming weeks. In an announcement planned before Mr Johnson was told to self-isolate, Downing Street said there would be a ""clear signal"" of his ""ongoing ambitions for the United Kingdom"". It said Mr Johnson would chair ""key Covid meetings"" and work with Chancellor Rishi Sunak to devise the upcoming spending review with an aim to fulfil his promise to ""build back better"". How to avoid catching coronavirus indoors These three symptoms cover 85% of coronavirus cases UK coronavirus cases up by 24,962 on Sunday But No 10's effort to start the week afresh following the departure of two of Mr Johnson's top aides amid an internal power struggle was overshadowed by news the prime minister was self-isolating. Mr Johnsonwrote on Twitter,externalon Sunday night: ""Today I was notified by NHS Test and Trace that I must self-isolate as I have been in contact with someone who tested positive for COVID-19. ""I have no symptoms, but am following the rules and will be working from No 10 as I continue to lead the government's pandemic response."" A No 10 spokesman added: ""The PM is well and does not have any symptoms of Covid-19."" In a WhatsApp message to Tory MPs seen by the BBC the PM added: ""The good news is that NHS Test and Trace continues to improve. The bad news is that I have been pinged!"" He said that he would observe self-isolation rules despite ""following the guidance and socially distancing"" during his meeting with Mr Anderson. ""It doesn't matter that I feel fine - better than ever - or that my body is bursting with antibodies because I have already had the damn thing,"" he added. ""The rules are the rules and they are there to stop the spread of the disease."" In April, Mr Johnson spent three nights in intensive care after falling ill with the virus. He later saidit ""could have gone either way""and thanked healthcare workers for saving his life. Boris Johnson will now have to stay at home in No 10. It means he will not be able to be in Parliament, though I'm told he will be working from Downing Street. He does still intend to keep communicating with the country. It was supposed to be a pretty big week for Boris Johnson - he is trying to reset his government after some factional fighting in his office over the last few days. There are conversations taking place with the parliamentary authorities to see whether he can still contribute to the Commons. I think it is fair to say this has not come at the best time for Mr Johnson: he has big decisions to make on Brexit and what happens when England's lockdown ends on 2 December. And it is also worth bearing in mind he was extremely ill with coronavirus earlier in the year and we do not know what getting the virus does for a person's immunity. Leader of the House of Commons Jacob Rees-Mogg said on Sunday evening he was urgently exploring how to ""support additional virtual participation"" in the chamber following a campaign by vulnerable MPs. Such a move could allow more MPs, including Mr Johnson, to attend Commons' debates virtually and possibly even Prime Minister's Questions as he self-isolates. On Thursday, Conservative MP Mr Anderson posted a photo of himself with Mr Johnson at No 10 alongside the words: ""Breakfast with the PM."" Mr Johnson said he observed all the guidelines and distancing advice during his meeting with Lee Anderson on Thursday Mr Anderson posted on his Facebook page to say he was self-isolating with his wife, who is clinically vulnerable. ""On Friday I lost my sense of taste at the same time my wife had a bad headache,"" he said. ""I had no cough, no fever and felt well. We both had a test on Saturday and the result came in Sunday morning. ""My wife and I both tested positive. I feel absolutely fine and my biggest concern is my wife who is in the shielded group. ""But we are both feeling good."" BBC political editor Laura Kuenssbergtweeted,externalthe news had come the night before what was meant to be a ""big relaunch week"", following the row last week involving the PM's chief adviser Dominic Cummings. Mr Cummingsleft Downing Street for the last time on Fridayfollowing internal battles about his role. Earlier this weekend,senior Tory MP David Davis said Mr Cummings' departurewas a chance to ""reset government"". Another Conservative MP, Sir Charles Walker, said the changes were a sign of Mr Johnson's ""determination to rebuild relationships"". A meeting between the PM and the Northern Research Group of backbench Tory MPs had been scheduled for Monday. LOCKDOWN LOOK-UP:The rules in your area CASES NEAR YOU:How many cases in your area? TEST AND TRACE:How does it work? SOCIAL DISTANCING:Can I give my friends a hug? Officials also confirmed the government's 10-point plan for a ""green industrial revolution"" would be published ""to boost green jobs whilst invigorating plans to achieve net zero by 2050"". Elements already announced include a newÂ£40m investment in green spaces across EnglandandÂ£160m for the wind turbine industry. In addition,another week of negotiations over a post-Brexit trade deal with the EUare set to begin in Brussels. The transition period, which followed Brexit in January, ends on 31 December by which time a deal needs to be agreed and approved by parliaments in the UK and EU. Chief UK negotiator David Frost has said there had been some progress between the two sides but that considerable differences remained. The UK government announced another 24,962 confirmed Covid cases on Sunday, as well as a further 168 deaths within 28 days of a positive test. What led to Dominic Cummings' departure?

"The first effective coronavirus vaccine can prevent more than 90% of people from getting Covid-19, a preliminary analysis shows. The developers - Pfizer and BioNTech - described it as a ""great day for science and humanity"". Their vaccine has been tested on 43,500 people in six countries and no safety concerns have been raised. The companies plan to apply for emergency approval to use the vaccine by the end of the month. No vaccine has gone from the drawing board to being proven highly effective in such a short period of time. There are still huge challenges ahead, but the announcement has been warmly welcomed with scientists describing themselves smiling ""ear to ear"" and some suggesting life could be back to normal by spring. ""I am probably the first guy to say that, but I will say that with some confidence,"" said Sir John Bell, regius professor of medicine at Oxford University. Stock markets rocket on Covid vaccine hopes Analysis: Have we finally got a vaccine? Who would get the coronavirus vaccine and how? A vaccine - alongside better treatments - is seen as the best way of getting out of the restrictions that have been imposed on all our lives. The data shows that two doses, three weeks apart, are needed. The trials - in US, Germany, Brazil, Argentina, South Africa and Turkey - show 90% protection is achieved seven days after the second dose. However, the data presented is not the final analysis as it is based on only the first 94 volunteers to develop Covid so the precise effectiveness of the vaccine may change when the full results are analysed. Dr Albert Bourla, the chairman of Pfizer, said: ""We are a significant step closer to providing people around the world with a much-needed breakthrough to help bring an end to this global health crisis."" Prof Ugur Sahin, one of the founders of BioNTech, described the results as a ""milestone"". This video can not be played Sarah Montague reacted with excitement upon hearing Professor Bell's views on the significance of today's vaccine news A limited number of people may get the vaccine this year. Pfizer and BioNTech say they will have enough safety data by the third week of November to take their vaccine to regulators. Until it has been approved it will not be possible for countries to begin their vaccination campaigns. The two companies say they will be able to supply 50 million doses by the end of this year and around 1.3 billion by the end of 2021. Each person needs two doses. The UK should get 10 million doses by the end of the year, with a further 30 million doses already ordered. Not everyone will get the vaccine straight away and countries are each deciding who should be prioritised. Hospital staff and care home workers will be near the top of every list because of the vulnerable people they work with, as will the elderly who are most at risk of severe disease. The UK is likely to prioritise older resident in care homes and the people that work there. But it saysa final decision has not been made,external, saying it will depend on how well the vaccine works in different age-groups and how the virus is spreading. People under 50 and with no medical problems are likely to be last in the queue. There are still many unanswered questions as this is only interim data. We do not know if the vaccine stops you spreading the virus or just from developing symptoms. Or if it works equally well in high-risk elderly people. The biggest question - how long does immunity last - will take months or potentially years to answer. There are also massive manufacturing and logistical challenges in immunising huge numbers of people, as the vaccine has to be kept in ultra-cold storage at below minus 80C. The vaccine appears safe from the large trials so far but nothing, including paracetamol, is 100% safe. There are around a dozen vaccines in the final stages of testing - known as a phase 3 trial - but this is the first to show any results. It uses a completely experimental approach - that involves injecting part of the virus's genetic code - in order to train the immune system. Previous trials have shown the vaccine trains the body to make both antibodies - and another part of the immune system called T-cells to fight the coronavirus. The UK's chief medical advisor Prof Chris Whitty said the results showed the ""power of science"" and was a ""reason for optimism"" for 2021. Allow Twitter content?

The UK Prime Minister's official spokesman said the results were ""promising"" and that ""the NHS stands ready to begin a vaccination programme for those most at risk once a Covid-19 vaccine is available"". Prof Peter Horby, from the University of Oxford, said: ""This news made me smile from ear to ear.

"The Pfizer/BioNTech coronavirus vaccine is one of two being rolled out across the UK. The government aims to vaccinate all 15 million people in the top four priority groups by mid-February and has got off to a strong start, with more than four million jabs administered. The vaccine trains the immune system to fight coronavirus. It is a new type of jab called an RNA vaccine and uses a tiny fragment of the virus's genetic code. This starts making part of the virus inside the body, which the immune system recognises as foreign and starts to attack. The genetic material is encased in a tiny protective bubble of fat to get it into cells. The exact ingredients of the vaccine have not been made public, but other vaccines can contain other ingredients, like aluminium, to make them stable or more effective. This video can not be played How will the new Pfizer vaccine work? This is the first RNA vaccine to be approved for use in humans. The concept has been researched before and people have been given them in clinical trials for other diseases. The vaccine will be considered by regulatory agencies around the world, who will decide whether the jab can be approved for use. NHS frontline staff, care home residents and workers, and the over 80s are first in line to receive the two vaccines being rolled out in the UK - Pfizer and Oxford University/AstraZeneca jab. About half of over-80s in the UK have now been vaccinated. People in England in their 70s, and those listed as clinically extremely vulnerable, are now beginning to receiving their offers of a jab. Out of the nine priority groups, those aged 50-54 are at the bottom of the current list. There will be a second phase, which will offer the vaccine to the other groups in the population. The vaccine was initially delivered in hospitals. It is now also being administered through GPs and care homes, as well as local vaccination centres in venues such as sports halls andmass vaccination hubsin places like cathedrals and sports halls. However, there are logistical challenges for the Pfizer vaccine: It must be keptat -70C during transportation The jab must be thawed before it is given to a patient It can be stored in a normal fridge for a few days before being used How do the Covid vaccines compare? It is impossible to know and we will find out only by waiting. If immunity does not last then it may be necessary to have annual vaccines, as we do for flu. The vaccine appears to protect 94% of adults over 65 years old and data from its phase three trial suggestsit works equally well in people of all ages and ethnicities. Early evidencesuggests the Pfizer vaccine is likely to protect against a coronavirus variant that is spreading around the UK. Some people - such as those with a weak immune system - will not be able to have the vaccine. Nothing in medicine is 100% safe - even something we take without thinking, like paracetamol, poses risks. The data so far is reassuring - trials on 43,500 people discovered no safety concerns, although mild side effects, such as headaches and muscle aches, have been reported. If there were highly dangerous and common consequences of this vaccination, they should have become apparent. However, rarer side effects may emerge as millions of people are immunised. Hopefully yes, but not for some time. If enough people are immune then the virus would stop spreading and we would not need other measures. However, the manufacture and distribution of a vaccine will take some time. So testing, lockdowns, social distancing, and mask wearing are going to be a feature of our lives for a while yet. The vaccine has been designed and developed by Pfizer and BioNtech, and they own the intellectual property. They already have the manufacturing capacity to produce 1.3 billion doses by the end of this year, but could partner with others to increase capacity even further. We do not know if the vaccine stops you catching and spreading the virus or just stops you from getting ill. We also don't know how protective the vaccine is in different age groups. These will be crucial for understanding how it will be used. About a dozen vaccines are in the final development stages. The Oxford University/AstraZeneca jab is also being used in the UK, and supplies of the approved Moderna vaccine should arrive in the spring.

"This video can not be played Blast off: Watch the SpaceX rocket head into space Four astronauts - three from the US and one from Japan - have launched from Florida on a mission to the International Space Station (ISS). The crew rode to orbit in a rocket and capsule provided by the SpaceX company. It's only the second time the firm has supplied the service. The US space agency Nasa has said it is now entering a new era in which routine astronaut journeys to low-Earth orbit are being conducted by commercial providers. The four individuals making their way up to the ISS are the Americans Michael Hopkins, Victor Glover and Shannon Walker, and the highly experienced Japanese space agency (Jaxa) astronaut Soichi Noguchi. By participating in this mission, Noguchi becomes only the third person in history to leave Earth in three different types of space vehicle, having previously flown on Soyuz and shuttle hardware. What is the SpaceX Crew Dragon? How astronaut transportation went commercial Orbital apparel: Evolution of the spacesuit The traditional ""walk-out"": The suited crew waved to family and friends The crew's Falcon rocket and Dragon capsule left the pad at the Kennedy Space Center at 19:27 local time (00:27 GMT, Monday). It took 12 minutes for the Falcon to get the Dragon into the right part of the sky and drop it off. ""Well done, that was one heck of a ride,"" crew commander Mike Hopkins radioed down to controllers. ""Congratulations to everyone. Resilience is in orbit."" ""Resilience"" is the name the astronauts have given their capsule. The ship will use its own thrusters to complete the rest of the journey up to the station. A docking with the orbiting platform is set for about 0400 GMT on Tuesday. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

When the team arrives, it will join Nasa's Kate Rubins and Russian space agency (Roscosmos) cosmonauts Sergey Ryzhikov and Sergey Kud-Sverchkov. Having seven people on the 410km-high outpost will triple the amount of science that can be performed in its special microgravity environment. The crew was driven down to the launch pad in a convoy of Tesla electric cars SpaceX has signed contracts with Nasa valued in excess of $3bn (Â£2.3bn) to develop, test and fly an astronaut taxi service. As part of this relationship, the company rana demonstration mission in Mayin which astronauts Doug Hurley and Bob Behnken were taken to the station and then returned safely to Earth. The contracted arrangements also call for six ""operational"", or routine, missions - this flight being the first. ""The big milestone here is that we are now moving away from development and test and into operational flights. And in fact this operational flight was licensed by the Federal Aviation Administration. So this is a truly a commercial launch,"" commented Nasa Administrator Jim Bridenstine. Nasa has a similar deal with the Boeing aerospace company, although its service is more than a year behind SpaceX. The agency says its new model of contracting out transportation to low-Earth orbit is saving billions of dollars in procurement costs. It intends to use these economies to fund its Moon and Mars ambitions. To that end, Nasa is close to testing the giant new rocket it has commissioned to take astronauts back to the lunar surface, a goal it hopes to attain in 2024, or soon after. Nasa's new 'megarocket' set for critical tests Nasa's giant SLS rocket: A guide Hopkins, Glover, Walker and Noguchi will stay on the ISS for six months. Just before they return to Earth, they'll be joined aloft by another SpaceX-launched crew for a brief handover. Indeed, the coming year is going to be very busy for the Californian service provider with plenty of trips up to the station being made by both its crewed and cargo-only versions of Dragon. ""In the next 15 months, we should be flying roughly seven Dragon missions. And this mission represents the initiation of a Dragon in orbit continuously - knocking on wood - and certainly is really the beginning of a new era in human spaceflight,"" said SpaceX's Gwynne Shotwell. The company president was in attendance at Kennedy, carrying out media duties in place of founder and CEO Elon Musk who is said to be suffering a mild case of Covid. A dramatic shot of the Merlin engines firing at the base of the Falcon rocket Nasa retired its winged space shuttles in 2011. In the intervening years, it's been buying seats for its astronauts on Russian Soyuz vehicles. This purchase option will now close in favour of the new American-sourced taxis. But US astronauts will continue to go to the station on Soyuz from time to time - it's just that no money will change hands. Instead, Russian cosmonauts will get flights in the American capsules in exchange. Soichi Noguchi has now flown in a SpaceX Dragon, a Soyuz capsule and a space shuttle The new crew will have at least four spacewalks to perform in their time at the station. In one of those walks, they will install the first significant UK industrial contribution to the platform. This is theColKa communications terminal. Made by MDA UK, the radio equipment will enable astronauts to connect with scientists and family on Earth at home broadband speeds. ColKa will be fixed to the exterior of Europe's ISS research module, Columbus. The UK participates on the station through its membership of the European Space Agency, an intergovernmental organisation that is a separate legal entity to the European Union. Will the UK have a seat on a space taxi? Libby Jackson, UK Space Agency The UK participates in the International Space Station, because the UK Space Agency exploration programme is part of the European Space Agency programme. We already have British scientists who are able to use the facilities on the ISS. And there are some experiments in development now to be carried out aboard the space station in the coming years. One, called the BioAsteroid project, run by the University of Edinburgh, will investigate how gravity affects the interaction between microbes and rock in reduced gravity. Astronauts on these space taxis will be taking these UK-led experiments to and from the space station. And much of the science can actually be operated remotely from the ground. We may well also see British astronauts flying on this vehicle in the future, too.

"This video can not be played George Eustice: ""We're not asking for anything miraculous... it should be possible."" Sticking points over a post-Brexit trade agreement between the UK and EU ""can be resolved"" and a deal ""can be done"", says a government minister. Environment Secretary George Eustice told the BBC's Andrew Marr ""agreement exists"" between the two sides. But earlier, he told Sky News there was still ""some way between us"" and ""time is very, very short"" to agree a deal. Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney said talks have ""got to make big progress"" in the coming week. He told Sky's Sophy Ridge getting a trade agreement was ""difficult but also very doable"", and the consequences of failing to would be ""significant"". The talks between the UK and EU are due to resume on Monday in Brussels. The UK's chief negotiator, Lord David Frost, has arrived in the city, tweeting that there had been ""some progress in a positive direction in recent days"". But he said ""significant elements"" of the deal are yet to be agreed, adding: ""We may not succeed."" Any deal between the UK and EU would need to be ratified by parliaments on both sides, so time is running out for an agreement to be reached and to get the sign off before 31 December. What are the sticking points in Brexit trade talks? How many trade deals has the UK done so far? 'Make or break' approaching for EU-UK trade talks The UK left the EU on 31 January, but continues to follow the bloc's rules until the end of the year while negotiations take place. If there is no agreement at that point, trade between the two will default to World Trade Organization (WTO) rules - with tariffs set to be introduced on many imports and exports, which could push up costs. Mr Eustice said there would be ""some impact"" in this situation, because of tariffs, but added most would be ""quite modest"". However, he conceded products such as lamb being sold into the EU could face taxes of more than 40%. The environment secretary told Andrew Marr: ""We do want to get a free trade agreement with the European Union and an agreement could be done. ""We are not asking for anything remarkable. We are asking for an agreement akin to the one they have with Canada. ""We are asking for something that has got a precedent."" The main sticking points between the two sides are over competition rules - where governments give state aid support to businesses - and on fishing rights. Mr Coveney said the conversation over fishing had become ""very emotive"" and both sides needed to ""dial down the language"", or the deal could collapse over the issue. He added: ""If a deal isn't done this week we have real problems. We are running out of time now.""

"Boris Johnson is self-isolating after meeting an MP who later tested positive for Covid-19. The prime minister said he was contacted by NHS Test and Trace on Sunday but is not showing symptoms. Mr Johnson on Thursday spent about 35 minutes with Ashfield MP Lee Anderson who has since tested positive. The news came as No 10 said Mr Johnson would make ""critical announcements"" about coronavirus and ""levelling up"" the UK over the coming weeks. In an announcement planned before Mr Johnson was told to self-isolate, Downing Street said there would be a ""clear signal"" of his ""ongoing ambitions for the United Kingdom"". It said Mr Johnson would chair ""key Covid meetings"" and work with Chancellor Rishi Sunak to devise the upcoming spending review with an aim to fulfil his promise to ""build back better"". How to avoid catching coronavirus indoors These three symptoms cover 85% of coronavirus cases UK coronavirus cases up by 24,962 on Sunday But No 10's effort to start the week afresh following the departure of two of Mr Johnson's top aides amid an internal power struggle was overshadowed by news the prime minister was self-isolating. Mr Johnsonwrote on Twitter,externalon Sunday night: ""Today I was notified by NHS Test and Trace that I must self-isolate as I have been in contact with someone who tested positive for COVID-19. ""I have no symptoms, but am following the rules and will be working from No 10 as I continue to lead the government's pandemic response."" A No 10 spokesman added: ""The PM is well and does not have any symptoms of Covid-19."" In a WhatsApp message to Tory MPs seen by the BBC the PM added: ""The good news is that NHS Test and Trace continues to improve. The bad news is that I have been pinged!"" He said that he would observe self-isolation rules despite ""following the guidance and socially distancing"" during his meeting with Mr Anderson. ""It doesn't matter that I feel fine - better than ever - or that my body is bursting with antibodies because I have already had the damn thing,"" he added. ""The rules are the rules and they are there to stop the spread of the disease."" In April, Mr Johnson spent three nights in intensive care after falling ill with the virus. He later saidit ""could have gone either way""and thanked healthcare workers for saving his life. Boris Johnson will now have to stay at home in No 10. It means he will not be able to be in Parliament, though I'm told he will be working from Downing Street. He does still intend to keep communicating with the country. It was supposed to be a pretty big week for Boris Johnson - he is trying to reset his government after some factional fighting in his office over the last few days. There are conversations taking place with the parliamentary authorities to see whether he can still contribute to the Commons. I think it is fair to say this has not come at the best time for Mr Johnson: he has big decisions to make on Brexit and what happens when England's lockdown ends on 2 December. And it is also worth bearing in mind he was extremely ill with coronavirus earlier in the year and we do not know what getting the virus does for a person's immunity. Leader of the House of Commons Jacob Rees-Mogg said on Sunday evening he was urgently exploring how to ""support additional virtual participation"" in the chamber following a campaign by vulnerable MPs. Such a move could allow more MPs, including Mr Johnson, to attend Commons' debates virtually and possibly even Prime Minister's Questions as he self-isolates. On Thursday, Conservative MP Mr Anderson posted a photo of himself with Mr Johnson at No 10 alongside the words: ""Breakfast with the PM."" Mr Johnson said he observed all the guidelines and distancing advice during his meeting with Lee Anderson on Thursday Mr Anderson posted on his Facebook page to say he was self-isolating with his wife, who is clinically vulnerable. ""On Friday I lost my sense of taste at the same time my wife had a bad headache,"" he said. ""I had no cough, no fever and felt well. We both had a test on Saturday and the result came in Sunday morning. ""My wife and I both tested positive. I feel absolutely fine and my biggest concern is my wife who is in the shielded group. ""But we are both feeling good."" BBC political editor Laura Kuenssbergtweeted,externalthe news had come the night before what was meant to be a ""big relaunch week"", following the row last week involving the PM's chief adviser Dominic Cummings. Mr Cummingsleft Downing Street for the last time on Fridayfollowing internal battles about his role. Earlier this weekend,senior Tory MP David Davis said Mr Cummings' departurewas a chance to ""reset government"". Another Conservative MP, Sir Charles Walker, said the changes were a sign of Mr Johnson's ""determination to rebuild relationships"". A meeting between the PM and the Northern Research Group of backbench Tory MPs had been scheduled for Monday. LOCKDOWN LOOK-UP:The rules in your area CASES NEAR YOU:How many cases in your area? TEST AND TRACE:How does it work? SOCIAL DISTANCING:Can I give my friends a hug? Officials also confirmed the government's 10-point plan for a ""green industrial revolution"" would be published ""to boost green jobs whilst invigorating plans to achieve net zero by 2050"". Elements already announced include a newÂ£40m investment in green spaces across EnglandandÂ£160m for the wind turbine industry. In addition,another week of negotiations over a post-Brexit trade deal with the EUare set to begin in Brussels. The transition period, which followed Brexit in January, ends on 31 December by which time a deal needs to be agreed and approved by parliaments in the UK and EU. Chief UK negotiator David Frost has said there had been some progress between the two sides but that considerable differences remained. The UK government announced another 24,962 confirmed Covid cases on Sunday, as well as a further 168 deaths within 28 days of a positive test. What led to Dominic Cummings' departure?

"Entertainer Des O'Connor has died at the age of 88, his agent has confirmed. The comedian, singer and TV host died on Saturday following a fall at his home in Buckinghamshire just over a week ago. He was known for hosting his own chat show, as well as Take Your Pick and Countdown - and for his friendship with Morecambe and Wise. In a statement his agent said he was ""well loved by absolutely everybody"" and ""loved life"". His long-time agent and family friend Pat Lake-Smith described him as the ""ultimate entertainer"" and said he had been recovering from the fall before his condition had suddenly deteriorated. She said: ""He was a joy to work with - he was talented, fun, positive, enthusiastic, kind and a total professional. He loved life, and considered enthusiasm almost as important as oxygen."" Obituary: Des O'Connor London-born O'Connor presented his own prime-time TV shows for more than 45 years but also had success as a singer. His friendship with comedy duo Morecambe and Wise saw him mocked for his singing ability in sketches despite a successful career which included four Top 10 hits and more than 30 albums. This video can not be played David Sillito looks back at Des O'Connor's career O'Connor appeared on stages around the world including hundreds of shows at the London Palladium. His fame soared when he was hired to host The Des O'Connor Show, which ran on ITV from 1963 to 1971. In 1977 he began hosting Des O'Connor Tonight, which started on BBC Two before moving to ITV, where it stayed until it ended in 2002. He later hosted the Channel 4 quiz show Countdown alongside Carol Vorderman, with the pair bowing out together in 2008, and was made a CBE for his services to entertainment and broadcasting in that year's birthday honours. This video can not be played Gyles Brandreth: ""I don't think you'll find anybody...who's got a thing to say against Des O'Connor"" O'Connor was married four times, and has described the end of his first three relationships as casualties of his obsession with work. In 2007, he married long-term girlfriend Jodie Brooke Wilson, who was 37 years his junior and gave birth to their son Adam when O'Connor was 72. O'Connor also had four daughters, Karin, TJ, Samantha and Kristina from his previous marriages. Tributes have been paid following his death, with Countdown co-host Vorderman saying he was a born entertainer and it had been a ""complete joy to work with him"". She told BBC News: ""I grew up throughout the Des O'Connor years, when he was on the television all the time, on Des O'Connor Tonight and the Morecambe and Wise shows. O'Connor was made a CBE in the 2008 Birthday Honours ""Up to 20 million people would sit around the television and watch and laugh, and I mean laugh until they cried. ""He was the king; he was one of the very great British television entertainers."" Fellow Countdown star Susie Dentdescribed him as a ""true gent"",externalwhile Call the Midwife star Stephen McGann said O'Connor ""never took himself too seriously"". Melanie Sykes, who hosted TV show Today With Des And Mel alongside O'Connor, said it was an ""education and a privilege to work with him"". She wrote on Instagram: ""He had talent in every fibre of his being and was stubborn as a mule. He was the full ticket as a friend and colleague."" Broadcaster Tony Blackburn said ""he was a great entertainer and more importantly a very nice person"", and TV presenter Gyles Brandreth described him as ""the ultimate professional"". Speaking about his sketches with Morecambe and Wise, comedian David Baddiel said: ""RIP Des O' Connor. It's worth remembering how brilliant he is at his own expense in these sketches."" Northampton Town Football Club alsojoined the tributes,externalto their former reserve player. The club said: ""We are very sorry to learn of the passing of Des O'Connor. Des famously played for our reserve team on a few occasions just after World War Two. Our thoughts are with all who knew Des."" Violinist Sue Croot told the BBC she had always treasured a signed photograph O'Connor gave to her father Ronald Croot, who was helping out on a production of Cinderella at the Grand Theatre in Swansea in the late 1950s. ""Dad said that Des was just such fun to be around and that he was such a down-to-earth person,"" she said.

"This video can not be played Barack Obama tells the BBC about the ""crazy conspiracies"" and ""truth decay"" in US politics The US faces a huge task in reversing a culture of ""crazy conspiracy theories"" that have exacerbated divides in the country, Barack Obama says. In a BBC interview, the former president says the US is more sharply split than even four years ago, when Donald Trump won the presidency. And Mr Obama suggests Joe Biden's victory in the 2020 US election is just the start of repairing those divisions. ""It'll take more than one election to reverse those trends,"" he says. Tackling a polarised nation, he argues, cannot be left only to the decisions of politicians, but also requires both structural change and people listening to one another - agreeing on a ""common set of facts"" before arguing what to do about them. However he says he sees ""great hope"" in the ""sophisticated"" attitudes of the next generation, urging young people to ""cultivate that cautious optimism that the world can change"" and ""to be a part of that change"". Why Donald Trump lost US election results in maps and charts The great dividing line of this year's election Anger and resentment between rural and urban America, immigration, injustices like inequality and ""the kinds of crazy conspiracy theories - what some have called truth decay"" have been amplified by some US media outlets and ""turbocharged by social media"", Mr Obama tells historian David Olusoga, in an interview for BBC Arts to promote his new memoir. ""We are very divided right now, certainly more than we were when I first ran for office in 2007 and won the presidency in 2008,"" the former president says. He suggests that this is, in part, attributable to Mr Trump's willingness to ""fan division because it was good for his politics"". Something else that has contributed hugely to the issue, Mr Obama says, is the spread of misinformation online, where ""facts don't matter"". ""There are millions of people who subscribed to the notion that Joe Biden is a socialist, who subscribed to the notion that Hillary Clinton was part of an evil cabal that was involved in paedophile rings,"" he says. The example he uses here with Ms Clinton relates toa fake theory alleging that Democratic politicians were running a paedophile ring out of a Washington pizza restaurant. ""I think at some point it's going to require a combination of regulation and standards within industries to get us back to the point where we at least recognise a common set of facts before we start arguing about what we should do about those facts."" Mr Obama has said that Joe Biden, who he is greeting here with a socially distant ""air elbow"", has ""all the qualities we need in a president right now"" Mr Obama says that while many conventional mainstream media outlets have embraced fact-checking in recent years in an effort to tackle the spread of misinformation online, it is often not enough because ""falsehoods had already circled the globe by the time truth got out of the gates"". He says division is also a result of socioeconomic factors such as increasing inequality and disparities between rural and urban America. Such issues, he adds, are ""paralleled in the UK and around the world"" with ""people feeling as if they're losing a grip on the ladder of economic advancement and so react and can be persuaded that it's this group's fault or that group's fault"". By Marianna Spring, Specialist disinformation reporter Viral conspiracy theories have been a staple feature of this year's US election - and a more mainstream school of thought during the Trump presidency. That's because online disinformation with conspiratorial undertones is no longer limited to the dark corners of the internet. It's promoted by prominent figures, with huge followings - like those in charge across the world, including in the White House. The polarised world of the internet - where everything is a matter of opinion rather than fact, and we choose our tribe - has created a fertile breeding ground for conspiracies and misinformation. An increasing number of people who use social media to do their own research come to misleading conclusions - these can be exacerbated by one-sided coverage of stories by partisan media. As Barack Obama points out, these falsehoods or misleading claims - especially when amplified by the media or public figures - prove to be much more popular than any debunk. The solution may not reside in just presenting the facts - as important as that remains. It's also about understanding why people turn to conspiracies online and how they were exposed to them repeatedly. I frequentlyspeak to victims of online conspiracy theoriesabout the damage they bring, and the divisions they cause. That has revealed how difficult and complex this damage is to undo. Mr Obama, who made history as America's first black president, says the issue of race has been ""one of the central fault lines in American history - our original sin"". The events that unfolded over the summer, including the death of George Floyd - a black man who died in police custody - and the response to his death from communities not just in the US but around the world, created moments of both despair and optimism, he says. This video can not be played George Floyd death: Whatâs changed, 100 days later? ""Despair that the chronic lingering role of race and bias in our criminal justice system continues in such a blatant form... enormous optimism that you saw an outpouring of protest activism and interest that far exceeded anything we had seen previously - and was peaceful."" How BLM went from Facebook post to global movement It was important that the protests were multi-racial, he says, adding that the response was different to that of the killing in 2012 of Trayvon Martin, an unarmed Florida teenager who was shot dead by neighbourhood watch volunteer George Zimmerman. Mr Zimmerman was later cleared of the 17-year-old's murder in a high-profile criminal case. Mr Obama also mentions the fatal shooting in 2014 of 18-year-old unarmed black man Michael Brown, who was shot six times by a white police officer in Ferguson, Missouri. He says that while those incidents inflamed passions across America, stirring up debate over race and justice, there still appeared to be ""resistance among large portions of the white community to push back against the notion that this was more than just one incident or a case of bad apples"". ""What you saw this summer was some communities that had a very negligible black population, folks going out there and saying Black Lives Matter and embracing the notion that real change has to come."" Mr Obama was speaking ahead of the release of his new memoir, A Promised Land, which charts his rise to the US Senate and first term as president. Due for release on 17 November, it is the first of two books covering his time in the White House. You can see the full interview in a special programme,Barack Obama talks to David Olusoga,this Wednesday on BBC One in the UK at 1930 GMT or internationally from Saturday 21 November on BBC World News.

"Donald Trump has insisted he is not conceding the US election, despite seemingly acknowledging for the first time that Democrat Joe Biden won. ""He won because the Election was Rigged,"" the Republican president wrote on Twitter, repeating unsubstantiated claims of election fraud. About an hour later he said he was not conceding the 3 November vote. He has launched a slew of lawsuits in key states, but has not provided any evidence to back his claims of fraud. On Friday, election officials said the vote was the ""most secure in American history"" and there was ""no evidence that any voting system deleted or lost votes, changed votes or was in any way compromised"". What legal challenges is Trump planning? How will this endless US election end? The 'dead voters' who are still alive Meanwhile, Mr Biden remains president-elect. The Democrat has 306 votes in the electoral college - the system the US uses to choose its president - which far exceeds the 270 threshold to win. Any recounts or legal challenges are not expected to overturn the overall result. Mr Biden's lead in the popular vote has also surpassed five million. Nevertheless, Mr Trump had refused to acknowledge Mr Biden's victory until - apparently - now. In a news conference on Friday, Mr Trump said ""who knows"" which administration would be in power in the future. His refusal to concede has heightened concerns about the US government's ability, going forward, to tackle growing Covid-19 infection rates. Analysis by Will Grant, BBC News, Washington DC Some Biden supporters consider the president's comments amounted to a form of concession, although it was far from unqualified. ""He won"", began President Trump's initial tweet, before descending into his customary slew of unsubstantiated allegations of electoral fraud. Mr Biden won, continued the president, because there were ""no vote watchers or observers allowed"", repeating his claims of a conspiracy led by the left and the media - while still presenting no evidence. Indeed, within a couple of hours, he contradicted his ""He won"" comment with another tweet, which read: ""He only won in the eyes of the fake news media, I concede nothing."" In essence, that is about as far as President Trump is likely to go. Even if he eventually acknowledges he won't be president from 20 January, he will probably never relinquish his unsubstantiated claims that he was beaten in a fraudulent vote. Twitter added warnings to Mr Trump's latest allegations of wrongdoing on Sunday, saying: ""This claim of election fraud is disputed."" The Trump campaign has launched a series of lawsuits saying Republican poll watchers were wrongly denied access to observe the counting of ballots in key battleground states. Election officials have denied this and insisted rules were followed. Most of the lawsuits have been dismissed over lack of evidence. However, thousands of Mr Trump's supporters protested in Washington DC on Saturday to back his appeals. Flag-carrying demonstrators were joined by members of far-right groups including the Proud Boys, some wearing helmets and bullet-proof vests. The largely peaceful demonstration saw some violence later in the evening, as Trump supporters and counter-protesters clashed in several skirmishes. Officials said 20 people had been arrested on a variety of charges, including assault and weapons possession. One stabbing was reported. Two police officers were also injured. This video can not be played What do Trump supporters think of a Biden presidency? Mr Trump's refusal to concede has stalled the normal handover process to the new government, ahead of the 20 January inauguration. The General Services Administration (GSA), the government agency tasked with beginning the process, has yet to recognise Mr Biden and his running mate Kamala Harris as winners. The Biden team have not been given access to classified security briefings, federal agencies and funding needed to ensure a smooth transition of power. Speaking to NBC on Sunday, Mr Biden's chief of staff, Ron Klain, said the process needed to begin this week to allow the country to focus on tackling the coronavirus pandemic. The US is grappling with some of its worst Covid-19 infection rates since the pandemic began, with more than 180,000 new cases and 1,400 deaths on Friday. The country also has the highest number of infections and deaths in the world, with more than 10.9m cases since the pandemic began. ""Joe Biden's going to become president of the United States in the midst of an ongoing crisis,"" said Mr Klain. ""That has to be a seamless transition."" Leading US infectious diseases expert, Dr Anthony Fauci, echoed his comments, saying it would be better for public health if the transition began immediately. Mr Klain also dismissed Mr Trump's latest conflicting comments on social media. ""Donald Trump's Twitter feed doesn't make Joe Biden president or not president"", he said. ""The American people did that.""

"Gordon Brown also said the ""middle of a recession"" was not the time to consider a second referendum A referendum on Scottish independence should not be held while the country ""heals"" from coronavirus, former prime minister Gordon Brown has said. Mr Brown said the country was facing ""huge problems"" and should not hold a referendum. ""We're in the middle of a virus, we're in the middle of a recession,""he told BBC's Andrew Marr programme. The SNP's Westminster leader Ian Blackford has said his party ""must"" plan for a referendum in 2021. Mr Blackford tweeted that a vote for the SNP in the Scottish Parliament elections next year would bea vote for a second referendum on Scottish independence,external. ""It is the people of Scotland who will determine our future. That is their right, sovereignty rests with us collectively. A vote for @theSNP in 2021 is for that right to be exercised, we know it, @BorisJohnson knows it,"" he said. Speaking in the Sunday National newspaper,external, Mr Blackford apologised for having to ""put off"" holding a referendum in 2020 as the Scottish government had to focus on its response to the Covid-19 pandemic. But Mr Blackford insisted that a referendum would happen and ""must take place in 2021"". Battle lines drawn again over Scotland's future Forget Indyref2, what about Indyref3? However Gordon Brown said the country needed ""time to heal"" before ""any divisive, conflicting referendum that really will cause consternation in Scotland for months and months to come"". ""The question at the moment is not whether you could have a referendum, the question is whether you should have a referendum,"" the former Labour leader said. ""I see the SNP leader is saying there's got to be a referendum in 2021. I think most Scottish people will make up their mind that in the middle of a virus, when you've got to heal the virus, you've got to heal the recession and you've got to look at the whole future of Britain... I don't think this is the right time at all."" Mr Brown also told the BBC that a ""wholesale, root and branch constitutional review"" was needed to bring people together. ""It's not just a Scottish problem now. It's not even just a Welsh problem and a Scottish problem - you see the revolt of the regions round the United Kingdom,"" he said. 'Indyref2 next year' may be what some increasingly impatient sections of the 'yes' movement want to hear two weeks before the SNP's virtual conference but it seems an unlikely timetable. Firstly, the pandemic will continue into 2021 and dealing with that will remain the overwhelming priority for all governments. Secondly, the Scottish government favours a referendum agreed with the UK governmentwhich has given every indication, so far, that it would refuse. Thirdly, the months available after the Holyrood election in May offer a very tight timetable for organising a referendum to the standards recommended by the Electoral Commission. That's a lot to navigate before you consider the work the SNP has to do to revise its independence plans to take account of whatever new trading relationship with the EU emerges from Brexit. I don't doubt the SNP's determination to push for another referendum. Nicola Sturgeon has promised a draft bill before the election and to put an explicit commitment to indyref2 in her party's manifesto. But that's not the same as actually holding the vote in 2021. The Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross said ""It beggars belief"" that Mr Blackford should suggest that another referendum was needed. He added: ""Ian Blackford's commitment to a referendum a few months from now is not just irresponsible but delusional and shows how out of touch the SNP are. ""The Scottish Conservatives are focusing on fighting the pandemic and rebuilding the economy. That is what people want and expect."" ""They feel they're not listened to, the government doesn't consult. They've got the local knowledge but not the resources. The government's got the resources but not the local knowledge. This is now a UK problem."" Battle lines drawn again over Scotland's future Forget Indyref2, what about Indyref3?

"Chatterjee played a Sherlock Holmes-like detective in Satyajit Ray's films Legendary Indian actor Soumitra Chatterjee, famed for his work with Oscar-winning director Satyajit Ray, has died from Covid complications. The 85-year-old actor was admitted to hospital in Kolkata city on 6 October after he tested positive for the virus. He will be mourned by fans and critics who avidly followed his six-decade-long career in Bengali language films. Chatterjee, who starred in more than 300 movies, was also an accomplished playwright, theatre actor and poet. He tested negative a few weeks after he was admitted to hospital but his condition soon deteriorated and he was put on a ventilator in the last week of October. He died on Sunday morning. Chatterjee was perhaps best-known for his work with Ray, one of the world's most influential directors and maker of the much-feted Apu Trilogy. The series followed the life of a man who grew up in a Bengali village. The films garnered critical acclaim, winning many awards worldwide, and put Indian cinema on the global map. The third movie of the trilogy, Apur Sansar, which released in 1959, was also Chatterjee's debut film. He would go on to star as the lead actor in 14 of Ray's films. Pauline Kael, one of America's most influential and respected film critics, called Chatterjee Ray's ""one-man stock company"" who moved ""so differently in the different roles he plays that he is almost unrecognisable"". Ray (left) cast Chatterjee (right) in 14 films Chatterjee was awarded the Dada Saheb Phalke Award, the highest honour in Indian cinema, in 2012 and in 2018, he was given France's highest award, the Legion of Honour. He began acting when he was in school, where he starred in several plays. He was in college when a friend introduced him to Ray - it was a chance meeting, but it eventually led to Chatterjee's film debut. ""I didn't know what to do when Mr Ray first asked me. I didn't know what was the real difference between stage and screen acting. I was afraid I'd overact,"" he told Marie Seton, film critic and biographer, in an interview. Chatterjee's roles in more than a dozen films made by the auteur spanned a wide range. He played a Sherlock Holmes-like detective in Sonar Kella, an effete bridegroom in Devi, a hot-tempered north Indian taxi driver in Abhijan, a city slicker in Aranyer Din Ratri, and a mild-mannered village priest in Ashani Sanket. He also played what Seton called a ""thinly veiled portrait"" of Nobel Prize-winning poet Rabindranath Tagore in Charulata, one of Ray's most admired films. ""His chief asset was the natural sensitivity of his appearance,"" Seton wrote of the actor. Ray mentored his favourite actor, lending him books on cinema and often taking him to watch Sunday morning shows of Hollywood films in Kolkata. ""The entire exercise he did with a purpose, it was not as if he was taking me out on Sundays for entertainment,"" Chatterjee once said. Chatterjee acted with Hugh Grant in a 1989 film set in Calcutta Ray, who died in 1992, had said that Chatterjee was an intelligent actor and ""given bad material, he turns out a bad performance"". ""Not a day passed when I do not think of Ray or discuss him or miss him. He is a constant presence in my life, if not for anything else but for the inspiration I derive when I think about him,"" Chatterjee told an interviewer. Chatterjee also played the romantic lead in popular Bengali films, but his appeal, say critics, was more limited than the reigning star, Uttam Kumar. Over the years, Chatterjee worked with leading directors like Tapan Sinha, Mrinal Sen, Asit Sen, Ajoy Kar, Rituparno Ghosh and Aparna Sen. In 1988, he worked with John Hurt and Hugh Grant in The Bengali Night, a film set in Kolkata. Adoor Gopalakrishnan, one of India's greatest filmmakers, said that on screen, Chatterjee ""became the quintessential Bengali - intellectually inclined, of middle-class orientation, sensitive and likeable"". This video can not be played Witness: Apu Trilogy Outside films, Chatterjee was tirelessly creative: he edited a literary magazine, published more than 30 books of essays and poetry; acted, directed and wrote an equal number of plays; and painted. One of his most successful plays, Ghatak Bidey, a comedy, ran for 500 nights. Chatterjee acted in a commercially successful Bengali adaption of King Lear, which many believe was one of his finest performances on stage. For all his popularity, Chatterjee stayed away from Bollywood, preferring to act in Bengali language films. ""Soumitra is the finest actor in the land today, but totally unheard of outside Bengal. It's a loss for India, Bollywood and I guess, a bit for Soumitra,"" Pritish Nandy, poet, journalist and filmmaker, said of the actor in 2012. Amitava Nag, author of a biography of the actor, says Chatterjee was ""the thinking man's hero. He was an intellectual and a poet"". Nag once asked Chatterjee whether he felt burdened by the obligation to entertain. ""Very seldom. This is my job,"" he said. Satyajit Ray: Working with Indiaâs cinematic master.

"Face coverings in corridors are already compulsory in other parts of the UK Face coverings could become compulsory for pupils at secondary schools in Wales. Education Minister Kirsty Williams says the Welsh Government is examining new scientific evidence about the spread of coronavirus among schoolchildren. She has told BBC Wales they are investigating what other measures can be put in place to make schools more ""Covid secure"". It included asking if there are ""more opportunities"" to use face masks. Newevidence suggests,externalhigher levels of infection and transmission in school based age groups ""than previously recognised"". Speaking toPolitics Wales, Ms Williams said: ""We're considering whether that, in light of this new evidence, it would be the appropriate thing to do."" Over the summer, the Welsh Government made schools and councils responsible for deciding where and when face masks should be worn in educational setting. Opposition parties and some education unions accused ministers at the time of passing the responsibility to schools. That was denied by Health Minister Vaughan Gething, who said a ""one-size-fits-all approach"" would not work in Wales. What happens if a school pupil gets coronavirus? Why men are less likely to wear a face covering The education minister said the latest reports from Welsh Government advisers and UK scientists still reinforces the view that children are ""very unlikely"" to suffer harm from Covid-19. ""But we have seen a growth in the amount of cases in the secondary school population and it does seem that those age group children do have a role in passing the virus around,"" said Ms Williams. The minister said the Welsh Government is also looking at ""further measures where we can reduce contacts"". This video can not be played BBC's Laura Foster explains how to wear your mask correctly and help stop coronavirus spreading Potential measures under consideration, according to government officials, include preventing children from changing in close proximity after exercise and reducing indoor group singing. All pupils and staff in England, Scotland and Northern Irelandmust wear face masksin corridors and communal areas. Senior students and staff at schools in areas of Scotland with higher infections rates are also advised to wear masks in the classroom. However data from the latest Office for National Statistics surveillance study shows higher levels of infection and transmission in school-based age groups than previously recognised,according to the Welsh Government's Technical Advisory Group,external(TAC). It also suggests there is a higher rate of transmission without symptoms and that children are more likely to be the first case in a household. Plaid Cymru's education spokeswoman in the Senedd Sian Gwenllian said face masks should already by mandatory. ""Time and again, we raised concerns that the virus was transmitting in secondary schools from pupil to pupil and from pupil to teacher - thereby triggering transmission in the wider community,"" said the Arfon MS. ""For the sake of our children's safety, the Welsh Government now needs to move quickly to adopt the latest scientific evidence from TAC and make masks mandatory in all secondary schools across Wales."" Welsh Conservative Suzy Davies said it was critical schools remain open. But the South Wales West MS said there needed to be ""clarity"" on the source of Covid infections. ""It would be pretty unfair to point the finger at older pupils and students if actually the source of the infection is outside in the community and they just happen to be bringing it in,"" she said. Wearing of face masks up to Welsh schools to decide School workers 'should have priority for tests' Schools face more disruption over Covid-19 cases Wales' mask rule 'to get ahead of gathering storm' Welsh Government At least 10 confirmed dead in Los Angeles wildfires What's the latest on the LA fires, and what caused them?

Sticking points over a post-Brexit trade agreement between the UK and EU ""can be resolved"" and a deal ""can be done"", says a government minister.

The discussions,revealed by Sky News,external, are understood to be progressing and a deal could be close to being reached. Another report suggested,externalthat Arcadia is drawing up plans to place the business into administration. But the company said: ""It is not true that administrators are about to be appointed."" ""Clearly, the second UK lockdown presents a further challenge for all retailers and we are taking all appropriate steps to protect our employees and other stakeholders from its consequences."" It is understood that Arcadia - led by Sir Philip Green - has contingency plans in place regarding the future of the business but there is confidence it will secure financing to continue trading. As well as Topshop, the group also owns the chains Topman, Miss Selfridge, Evans, Burton and Dorothy Perkins. Non-essential retailers in England have been forced to close for four weeks until 2 December to contain the spread of the coronavirus. Coronavirus: Which shops will be allowed to open in lockdown? Clothes and book sellers furious at lockdown rules During the first country-wide lockdown, Arcadia furloughed the vast majority of its 13,000-strong workforce across more than 500 outlets. Sir Philip Green leads Arcadia while his wife, Lady Cristina Green, is its biggest shareholder Staff at its shops in England have been placed back on the government's wage subsidy scheme though its stores in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland have now reopened. Arcadia said: ""We are continuing to trade online through our own channels as well as through those of our partners."" However, Debenhams, a major Arcadia partner which sells a number of its brands, is facing its own challenges. The department store chain is in administration and is in talks to find a buyer. Arcadia underwent restructuring last year through a company voluntary arrangement (CVA). It agreed to shut 50 shops, secured a rent cut with landlords on property and struck a deal with the Pension Protection Fund to put money into the company's pension schemes. At the time, the pension scheme deficit was estimated to be around Â£700m but the Sunday Times reported it is now Â£350m on a buyout basis. In a deal with the Pensions Regulator, trustees of Arcadia's pension schemes were granted security over Â£210m worth of assets by the company. Sir Philip's wife, Lady Cristina Green, who is Arcadia's biggest shareholder, agreed to pump Â£100m into the schemes over three years while Arcadia said it would inject a further Â£75m. Sir Philip faced controversy over the pension scheme at one of his other businesses, BHS, which he sold to Dominic Chappell for Â£1 in 2015. BHS collapsed a year later, with the loss of 11,000 jobs and a pension deficit of Â£571m. Sir Philip reached a deal with the Pensions Regulator to inject Â£363m into that scheme.

"Laura Linkson helps run a Facebook group for women like her who believe they have been affected by the device Lawyers have begun legal action on behalf of 200 UK women against the makers of a sterilisation device, after claims of illness and pain. The device, a small coil called Essure, was implanted to prevent pregnancies. Manufacturer Bayer has already set aside more than $1.6bn (Â£1.2bn) to settle claims from almost 40,000 women in the US. It has withdrawn the device from the market for commercial reasons but says it stands by its safety and efficacy. The metal coil was inserted into the fallopian tube to cause scarring, blocking the tube and preventing pregnancy. Introduced in 2002, it was promoted as an easy, non-surgical procedure - a new era in sterilisation. But many women who had the device fitted have now either had hysterectomies or are waiting for procedures to remove the device. Lives ruined as damage viewed as 'women's problems' Endometriosis care needs urgent improvement, MPs say The women from Northern Ireland 'crippled by contraception Tracey Pitcher, who lives in Hampshire, felt she had completed her family and did not want any more children. Her doctor strongly encouraged her to have an Essure device fitted, she says. But after it had been, she began to feel very unwell. ""I just started to have heavy periods, migraines, which I had only ever had when I was pregnant so they were hormonal,"" she says. ""My back was so painful I'd wake up crying in the middle of the night with pains in my hips and my back."" Tracey says she battled to persuade doctors to take her symptoms seriously. But the only information she received was from a Facebook group. ""It's easy to get it done,"" she says. ""It's easy to say, 'You have this - it's wonderful.' ""But then the fallout - there's nobody there, there's no support apart from people that we've found ourselves, no-one will listen, because it's just 'women's things'."" More than 1,000 women have now subscribed to that Facebook page. Laura Linkson, who has helped run it, believes she was harmed by her Essure device, and says the severe physical and psychological nature of her symptoms has had a devastating impact on her family life. ""I'd say it's destroyed my life and my children's lives,"" she says. Kim Henderson, who lives near Southampton, feels her doctor pushed her into having an Essure coil fitted. As soon as it had been, she started feeling severe pain. Like many of the women, she was regularly admitted to hospital only to be told there was nothing wrong with her. And she began to wonder if it was all in her head, until she found other women discussing their symptoms on the Facebook page. ""It's been really hard,"" she says, ""not just physically but mentally. ""I feel my children have missed out on a lot. ""And it makes me feel guilty because if I hadn't had Essure, then I wouldn't be where I am now."" ""Life would be very different for me and my children."" Kim feels her doctor pushed her into having an Essure coil fitted Solicitor Lisa Lunt, head of medical product liability at the law firm PGMBM, who is leading the group action in England, says: ""The reports that have come out from the American proceedings are that [developer] Conceptus and Bayer were failing to report adverse events. ""That's when they become aware that there are problems with the device. ""And that's something that we're going to look at very, very, carefully indeed."" Bayer strongly denies the allegations, saying it has never violated regulations around complaints. ""Patient safety is Bayer's highest priority,"" it said. ""We take all adverse events seriously, continually collect and analyse the data we receive, and work with the [US Food and Drug Administration] to monitor Essure's safety profile. ""The company stands behind the safety and efficacy of Essure, which are demonstrated by an extensive body of research, undertaken by Bayer and independent medical researchers, involving more than 270,000 women over the past two decades."" But some doctors who have fitted Essure devices remain sceptical. Gynaecology professor Bas Veersema, an expert in Essure removal, at UMC Utrecht hospital, in Holland, says the monitoring of new medical devices is inadequate. ""We learned from the mesh problems, we have learned from the breast implants, we have learned from the Essure device, that if you put materials in the body for a long time, we need more information, with long follow-ups, what it does to the body,"" he says. ""And, to be honest, we don't know."" The UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency said: ""Patient safety is our highest priority. ""And there is currently no evidence to suggest any increased risk to patient safety. ""Any women with questions should speak to their GP or healthcare professional.""

"This video can not be played Blast off: Watch the SpaceX rocket head into space Four astronauts - three from the US and one from Japan - have launched from Florida on a mission to the International Space Station (ISS). The crew rode to orbit in a rocket and capsule provided by the SpaceX company. It's only the second time the firm has supplied the service. The US space agency Nasa has said it is now entering a new era in which routine astronaut journeys to low-Earth orbit are being conducted by commercial providers. The four individuals making their way up to the ISS are the Americans Michael Hopkins, Victor Glover and Shannon Walker, and the highly experienced Japanese space agency (Jaxa) astronaut Soichi Noguchi. By participating in this mission, Noguchi becomes only the third person in history to leave Earth in three different types of space vehicle, having previously flown on Soyuz and shuttle hardware. What is the SpaceX Crew Dragon? How astronaut transportation went commercial Orbital apparel: Evolution of the spacesuit The traditional ""walk-out"": The suited crew waved to family and friends The crew's Falcon rocket and Dragon capsule left the pad at the Kennedy Space Center at 19:27 local time (00:27 GMT, Monday). It took 12 minutes for the Falcon to get the Dragon into the right part of the sky and drop it off. ""Well done, that was one heck of a ride,"" crew commander Mike Hopkins radioed down to controllers. ""Congratulations to everyone. Resilience is in orbit."" ""Resilience"" is the name the astronauts have given their capsule. The ship will use its own thrusters to complete the rest of the journey up to the station. A docking with the orbiting platform is set for about 0400 GMT on Tuesday. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

When the team arrives, it will join Nasa's Kate Rubins and Russian space agency (Roscosmos) cosmonauts Sergey Ryzhikov and Sergey Kud-Sverchkov. Having seven people on the 410km-high outpost will triple the amount of science that can be performed in its special microgravity environment. The crew was driven down to the launch pad in a convoy of Tesla electric cars SpaceX has signed contracts with Nasa valued in excess of $3bn (Â£2.3bn) to develop, test and fly an astronaut taxi service. As part of this relationship, the company rana demonstration mission in Mayin which astronauts Doug Hurley and Bob Behnken were taken to the station and then returned safely to Earth. The contracted arrangements also call for six ""operational"", or routine, missions - this flight being the first. ""The big milestone here is that we are now moving away from development and test and into operational flights. And in fact this operational flight was licensed by the Federal Aviation Administration. So this is a truly a commercial launch,"" commented Nasa Administrator Jim Bridenstine. Nasa has a similar deal with the Boeing aerospace company, although its service is more than a year behind SpaceX. The agency says its new model of contracting out transportation to low-Earth orbit is saving billions of dollars in procurement costs. It intends to use these economies to fund its Moon and Mars ambitions. To that end, Nasa is close to testing the giant new rocket it has commissioned to take astronauts back to the lunar surface, a goal it hopes to attain in 2024, or soon after. Nasa's new 'megarocket' set for critical tests Nasa's giant SLS rocket: A guide Hopkins, Glover, Walker and Noguchi will stay on the ISS for six months. Just before they return to Earth, they'll be joined aloft by another SpaceX-launched crew for a brief handover. Indeed, the coming year is going to be very busy for the Californian service provider with plenty of trips up to the station being made by both its crewed and cargo-only versions of Dragon. ""In the next 15 months, we should be flying roughly seven Dragon missions. And this mission represents the initiation of a Dragon in orbit continuously - knocking on wood - and certainly is really the beginning of a new era in human spaceflight,"" said SpaceX's Gwynne Shotwell. The company president was in attendance at Kennedy, carrying out media duties in place of founder and CEO Elon Musk who is said to be suffering a mild case of Covid. A dramatic shot of the Merlin engines firing at the base of the Falcon rocket Nasa retired its winged space shuttles in 2011. In the intervening years, it's been buying seats for its astronauts on Russian Soyuz vehicles. This purchase option will now close in favour of the new American-sourced taxis. But US astronauts will continue to go to the station on Soyuz from time to time - it's just that no money will change hands. Instead, Russian cosmonauts will get flights in the American capsules in exchange. Soichi Noguchi has now flown in a SpaceX Dragon, a Soyuz capsule and a space shuttle The new crew will have at least four spacewalks to perform in their time at the station. In one of those walks, they will install the first significant UK industrial contribution to the platform. This is theColKa communications terminal. Made by MDA UK, the radio equipment will enable astronauts to connect with scientists and family on Earth at home broadband speeds. ColKa will be fixed to the exterior of Europe's ISS research module, Columbus. The UK participates on the station through its membership of the European Space Agency, an intergovernmental organisation that is a separate legal entity to the European Union. Will the UK have a seat on a space taxi? Libby Jackson, UK Space Agency The UK participates in the International Space Station, because the UK Space Agency exploration programme is part of the European Space Agency programme. We already have British scientists who are able to use the facilities on the ISS. And there are some experiments in development now to be carried out aboard the space station in the coming years. One, called the BioAsteroid project, run by the University of Edinburgh, will investigate how gravity affects the interaction between microbes and rock in reduced gravity. Astronauts on these space taxis will be taking these UK-led experiments to and from the space station. And much of the science can actually be operated remotely from the ground. We may well also see British astronauts flying on this vehicle in the future, too.

"Laura Linkson helps run a Facebook group for women like her who believe they have been affected by the device Lawyers have begun legal action on behalf of 200 UK women against the makers of a sterilisation device, after claims of illness and pain. The device, a small coil called Essure, was implanted to prevent pregnancies. Manufacturer Bayer has already set aside more than $1.6bn (Â£1.2bn) to settle claims from almost 40,000 women in the US. It has withdrawn the device from the market for commercial reasons but says it stands by its safety and efficacy. The metal coil was inserted into the fallopian tube to cause scarring, blocking the tube and preventing pregnancy. Introduced in 2002, it was promoted as an easy, non-surgical procedure - a new era in sterilisation. But many women who had the device fitted have now either had hysterectomies or are waiting for procedures to remove the device. Lives ruined as damage viewed as 'women's problems' Endometriosis care needs urgent improvement, MPs say The women from Northern Ireland 'crippled by contraception Tracey Pitcher, who lives in Hampshire, felt she had completed her family and did not want any more children. Her doctor strongly encouraged her to have an Essure device fitted, she says. But after it had been, she began to feel very unwell. ""I just started to have heavy periods, migraines, which I had only ever had when I was pregnant so they were hormonal,"" she says. ""My back was so painful I'd wake up crying in the middle of the night with pains in my hips and my back."" Tracey says she battled to persuade doctors to take her symptoms seriously. But the only information she received was from a Facebook group. ""It's easy to get it done,"" she says. ""It's easy to say, 'You have this - it's wonderful.' ""But then the fallout - there's nobody there, there's no support apart from people that we've found ourselves, no-one will listen, because it's just 'women's things'."" More than 1,000 women have now subscribed to that Facebook page. Laura Linkson, who has helped run it, believes she was harmed by her Essure device, and says the severe physical and psychological nature of her symptoms has had a devastating impact on her family life. ""I'd say it's destroyed my life and my children's lives,"" she says. Kim Henderson, who lives near Southampton, feels her doctor pushed her into having an Essure coil fitted. As soon as it had been, she started feeling severe pain. Like many of the women, she was regularly admitted to hospital only to be told there was nothing wrong with her. And she began to wonder if it was all in her head, until she found other women discussing their symptoms on the Facebook page. ""It's been really hard,"" she says, ""not just physically but mentally. ""I feel my children have missed out on a lot. ""And it makes me feel guilty because if I hadn't had Essure, then I wouldn't be where I am now."" ""Life would be very different for me and my children."" Kim feels her doctor pushed her into having an Essure coil fitted Solicitor Lisa Lunt, head of medical product liability at the law firm PGMBM, who is leading the group action in England, says: ""The reports that have come out from the American proceedings are that [developer] Conceptus and Bayer were failing to report adverse events. ""That's when they become aware that there are problems with the device. ""And that's something that we're going to look at very, very, carefully indeed."" Bayer strongly denies the allegations, saying it has never violated regulations around complaints. ""Patient safety is Bayer's highest priority,"" it said. ""We take all adverse events seriously, continually collect and analyse the data we receive, and work with the [US Food and Drug Administration] to monitor Essure's safety profile. ""The company stands behind the safety and efficacy of Essure, which are demonstrated by an extensive body of research, undertaken by Bayer and independent medical researchers, involving more than 270,000 women over the past two decades."" But some doctors who have fitted Essure devices remain sceptical. Gynaecology professor Bas Veersema, an expert in Essure removal, at UMC Utrecht hospital, in Holland, says the monitoring of new medical devices is inadequate. ""We learned from the mesh problems, we have learned from the breast implants, we have learned from the Essure device, that if you put materials in the body for a long time, we need more information, with long follow-ups, what it does to the body,"" he says. ""And, to be honest, we don't know."" The UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency said: ""Patient safety is our highest priority. ""And there is currently no evidence to suggest any increased risk to patient safety. ""Any women with questions should speak to their GP or healthcare professional.""

"Unemployment following the mine closures was largely confined to communities in the south Wales valleys, Baroness Debbie Wilcox says The impact of the coronavirus pandemic on communities in Wales will be on a ""different scale"" to that seen after the coal and steel industries collapsed in the 1980s, a peer has said. Baroness Debbie Wilcox, who once led Newport council, said its effect would be more wide-ranging and last longer. Her warning comes as unemployment in Wales sawthe highest rise in the UK. One bar owner in Newport said it had been the most difficult period of his 45 years in the business. Baroness Wilcox, former leader of the Welsh Local Government Association and a Labour life peer in the House of Lords, has first-hand experience of the economic hardship felt in coal-mining communities in the 1980s. Baroness Debbie Wilcox says she ""remembers the anguish"" of the 1980s ""My stepfather was a miner at Ty Mawr colliery and I was part of Maerdy women's support group, and by goodness we thought we had it bad then,"" she explained. ""I remember the anguish of those times - but this is on a different scale."" She said communities in the south Wales valleys had never fully recovered from the ""destruction"" of the coal industry. ""But this [pandemic] affects everyone,"" she added. ""No job, no industry, none of us are exempt from it, therefore it is bound to have a longer lasting effect."" Baroness Wilcox said it was important to invest in young people and called on communities to pull together. The Waterloo Hotel in Newport has been closed since March The Waterloo Hotel, near Newport's Transporter Bridge, used to be packed full of docks workers and steelworkers, and once boasted the longest bar in the UK. It is not full of dockers any more, Bob Evans bought the bar 14 years ago and developed it into a vibrant bistro and boutique hotel. But it has been closed since March and Mr Evans decided against reopening in the summer because it would not have been profitable, and is now selling up. Bob Evans has worked in hospitality for 45 years but says he has never known a time like it ""We spent so much money here and built up the trade. So to have to close your doors through no fault of your own - I can't tell you, it was awful,"" Mr Evans said. Mr Evans, who has worked in hospitality for 45 years, said he had never known a time like it. ""This has been the worst, without a doubt - I have never had to shut my doors,"" he said. ""It is a total disaster and there are lots of people who won't come out of this."" Wales sees job ads surge while London lags Wales Covid infection rates rising Young people hit as unemployment rate rises The latest official figures show unemployment in Wales has risen to 4.6% - slightly lower than the UK average. But more than 20,000 people have left pay rolls since February, not including many who are self-employed. The figures also show unemployment rose between July and September when businesses were allowed to open, the Eat Out to Help Out scheme was operating and tourists flooded to Wales for holidays because of restrictions on travelling abroad. One reason for this could be redundancies which had been announced earlier in the year but were delayed. This was the case particularly in the aerospace sector, which is highly important to the Welsh economy. Former head of employment statistics at the ONS Jamie Jenkins says furlough might have ""masked"" the scale of joblessness in Wales Many employers had already finalised redundancy agreements before the UK government extended thethe furlough scheme, according to the former head of employment statistics at the ONS. Jamie Jenkins explained: ""It could be that the furlough scheme has masked the true unemployment problem we have had in Wales during the summer months. ""As that came to an end [in October] it was announced that it was extended, but it was probably too late for many people."" What happens when furlough ends?

"Face coverings in corridors are already compulsory in other parts of the UK Face coverings could become compulsory for pupils at secondary schools in Wales. Education Minister Kirsty Williams says the Welsh Government is examining new scientific evidence about the spread of coronavirus among schoolchildren. She has told BBC Wales they are investigating what other measures can be put in place to make schools more ""Covid secure"". It included asking if there are ""more opportunities"" to use face masks. Newevidence suggests,externalhigher levels of infection and transmission in school based age groups ""than previously recognised"". Speaking toPolitics Wales, Ms Williams said: ""We're considering whether that, in light of this new evidence, it would be the appropriate thing to do."" Over the summer, the Welsh Government made schools and councils responsible for deciding where and when face masks should be worn in educational setting. Opposition parties and some education unions accused ministers at the time of passing the responsibility to schools. That was denied by Health Minister Vaughan Gething, who said a ""one-size-fits-all approach"" would not work in Wales. What happens if a school pupil gets coronavirus? Why men are less likely to wear a face covering The education minister said the latest reports from Welsh Government advisers and UK scientists still reinforces the view that children are ""very unlikely"" to suffer harm from Covid-19. ""But we have seen a growth in the amount of cases in the secondary school population and it does seem that those age group children do have a role in passing the virus around,"" said Ms Williams. The minister said the Welsh Government is also looking at ""further measures where we can reduce contacts"". This video can not be played BBC's Laura Foster explains how to wear your mask correctly and help stop coronavirus spreading Potential measures under consideration, according to government officials, include preventing children from changing in close proximity after exercise and reducing indoor group singing. All pupils and staff in England, Scotland and Northern Irelandmust wear face masksin corridors and communal areas. Senior students and staff at schools in areas of Scotland with higher infections rates are also advised to wear masks in the classroom. However data from the latest Office for National Statistics surveillance study shows higher levels of infection and transmission in school-based age groups than previously recognised,according to the Welsh Government's Technical Advisory Group,external(TAC). It also suggests there is a higher rate of transmission without symptoms and that children are more likely to be the first case in a household. Plaid Cymru's education spokeswoman in the Senedd Sian Gwenllian said face masks should already by mandatory. ""Time and again, we raised concerns that the virus was transmitting in secondary schools from pupil to pupil and from pupil to teacher - thereby triggering transmission in the wider community,"" said the Arfon MS. ""For the sake of our children's safety, the Welsh Government now needs to move quickly to adopt the latest scientific evidence from TAC and make masks mandatory in all secondary schools across Wales."" Welsh Conservative Suzy Davies said it was critical schools remain open. But the South Wales West MS said there needed to be ""clarity"" on the source of Covid infections. ""It would be pretty unfair to point the finger at older pupils and students if actually the source of the infection is outside in the community and they just happen to be bringing it in,"" she said.

"Are the winds of change about to blow off the Welsh coast? Wind turbines floating miles out to sea could one day provide electricity to our homes, experts believe. Wales currently meets about50% of its needs,externalfrom renewable sources, including solar and wind. Prime MinisterBoris Johnson wants to see fixed offshore wind farmspower UK homes by 2030, while Plaid Cymru believes Wales could be self-sustainable through renewables by then. But how big a part could turbines floating off the Welsh coast play? World's first floating offshore wind farm in Scotland Wind farms could power every home by 2030 A 96 megawatt (MW) wind farmcapable of powering 90,000 homesis proposed for an area of sea 28 miles (45km) off Pembrokeshire by 2027. However, this could be just the tip of the iceberg, in light of other developments. Successfultrials in Scotlandsuggest floating turbines could have advantages over other types of renewables, including cost and environmental impact. Turbines would tower over some of the world's most famous landmarks Tidal lagoons, for example, have proved hard to get off the ground because of the large upfront investment needed to build, with no return for a number of years, according to Cardiff University professor of renewable energy Nick Jenkins. Aproposed Â£1.3bn Swansea Bay projectwas shelved because of cost. Placing solar panels and wind turbines on a large scale in rural Wales can also be difficult, withobjections from campaigners and locals over the impacton the landscape. As Wales has about 1,680 miles (2,704 km) of coast, generating electricity there could be the obvious solution. However, given the sea bed ""drops dramatically"" in many locations, Prof Jenkins believes fixed turbines are difficult in many places. This video can not be played Floating wind farm plan ""really exciting"" ""The fact that these (floating) turbines are so far out to sea make them less visible,"" said Rhodri James, of global energy firm Equinor. ""It does help, as some people in certain areas don't want to see them. And in protected areas, such as Pembrokeshire National Park, putting them close to the shore might be difficult."" There are also other benefits, such as saving on the expense on steel to fix turbines 60m underwater into the seabed, and the higher wind speeds further out to sea and potentially more power generated. Cables are used to attach the floating turbines to the seabed, meaning they can be placed in depths of hundreds of metres Global energy company Equinor first had the idea of floating turbines in 2001, to power offshore oil and gas platforms in Norwegian waters. These were run off diesel, which proved expensive and bad for the environment. While the initial aim was to provide clean energy at low cost, Mr James said Equinor quickly realised this was scratching the surface, adding: ""It had the potential to feed into the National Grid if done on a utility scale."" In trials, floating turbines produced impressive results in terms of generation Mr James said adding more turbines reduced costs because of more power generated and saw expenditure per megawatt reduced by 70% with hopes of a further 40% cut. Fixed platforms are generally placed up to a depth of 60m, with floating turbines able to go in waters up to 1,000m. ""Pembrokeshire is the most favourable part of Wales as it has deep waters. There is a fair bit of offshore generation off north Wales, but they are fixed platforms in shallower waters,"" Mr James added. ""Wales is well-placed as an area to look into further as is Cornwall, Ireland, the Celtic Sea, but it's currently more extensive in Scotland, where there will be more tests and demonstrations and we are very confident of moving to full scale."" This video can not be played The world's first floating offshore wind farm in Scotland Currently, UK offshore farms produce about 10 gigawatts (GW) of power, witha target of 40GWby 2030. A recent Welsh Governmentreport,externalsaid just two or three farms could provide 2GW of power, enough for more than a million homes. Graham Ayling, of the Energy Saving Trust, said the potential to create infrastructure ""looks promising"" and Wales could be self-sufficient from green energy within a decade. ""Given the pace that renewable technologies have been deployed and developed, and the cost reductions that have been seen in recent years, it is possible that Wales may well meet 100% of its electricity needs from renewable sources by 2030,"" he said. The Beatrice offshore wind farm in Scotland generates enough power for more than 450,000 properties Beingself-sustainable in renewablesby the end of the 2020s was something proposed by Plaid Cymru in its 2019 General Election manifesto. Environment spokesman Llyr Gruffydd said wave and tidal sources off Pembrokeshire, in the Celtic Sea and off Anglesey were ""some of the best potential renewable energy resource in the world"". He said utilising these should be ""a strategic priority"", but also the most promising forms of renewable energy are emerging technologies and will not be fully utilised until the end of the decade. Meanwhile, Mr Gruffydd wants to see investment in research, development and building skills in the workforce, so the country is ready to take advantage in areas such as floating wind technology. The Welsh Conservatives' energy spokeswoman Janet Finch-Saunders said Wales' natural resources provide the opportunity to help stimulate the economy with the creation of ""long-term green-collar jobs"".

"This video can not be played ''We fled from death and murder'' The 12-day conflict between Ethiopia's government and forces in the country's Tigray region has escalated. The Tigrayan forces fired rockets across the border into neighbouring Eritrea, after claiming Ethiopian soldiers were using an Eritrean airport to attack Tigray. Ethiopia's prime minister appeared to deny the accusationsin a tweet,external. But analysts say the latest attacks mark a major uptick in a conflict which has displaced thousands of civilians. How Ethiopia's conflict could destabilise its neighbours Marooned by conflict: 'My little brother needs medicine' Ethiopia has been through big changes since Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed came to power in 2018. He was awarded the Nobel peace prize last year after reaching out to make peace with neighbouring Eritrea, with whom Ethiopia had fought a bloody war two decades ago. But the widespread reforms he pushed through sidelined the Tigrayans of the Tigray People's Liberation Front party (TPLF) who had long dominated the political scene - and in recent weeks, tensions between the party and the federal government seriously escalated. Animosity between the government in Tigray and Eritrea goes back a long way, according to the BBC's Africa regional editor Will Ross, who says much of it stems from that border war of 20 years ago which left tens of thousands of soldiers dead. On Sunday, the Ethiopian Human Rights Commission said gunmen had killed at least 34 people on a passenger bus on Saturday night in the western region of Benishangul-Gumuz. The region has seen other acts of violence recently and there has so far been no known link with the Tigray region. On Saturday night, residents of Asmara - Eritrea's capital - reported hearing loud explosions, amid reports of rockets landing near the city's airport. No casualties have been reported yet. Tigrayan leader Debretsion Gebremichael has suggested that his forces have been fighting 16 divisions of the Eritrean army on several fronts for the past few days. The Tigrayans have also accused Eritrean forces of crossing into Ethiopia to back federal forces there. On Sunday,in a tweet,external, Mr Abiy appeared to deny that Ethiopian national forces were working with Eritreans, saying that Ethiopia was ""more than capable of attaining the objectives of the operation by itself"". But while Eritrea and Ethiopia have denied co-operating in the conflict, our regional editor says reports of fighting along the border, and of Ethiopian soldiers being treated in Eritrean hospitals, suggest the opposite is true. By Will Ross, BBC Africa regional editor With missiles being fired into Eritrea this conflict has now become far more serious and is likely to be harder to stop. The repercussions could now cause instability in the whole region. But many people familiar with recent political developments had predicted trouble was brewing when Ethiopia's Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed  became a strong ally of Eritrea's authoritarian leader, Isaias Afwerki. Now the two men have a common enemy - the Tigrayan politicians of the TPLF who dominated Ethiopia's political scene for years, including the time when Ethiopia and Eritrea fought a border war that left tens of thousands dead. International calls for dialogue have so far been ignored and thousands of civilian refugees continue to flee the fighting into Sudan. Hundreds have died in Ethiopia since the fighting began, with reports of a civilian massacre emerging this week. Human rights groupAmnesty International said it had confirmed that ""scores, and likely hundreds, of people were stabbed or hacked to death"" in the town of Mai-Kadra (May Cadera),externalon Monday. Why there are fears of civil war in Ethiopia Fake news being shared over Ethiopia conflict Read more about life in Tigray Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed has accused forces loyal to Tigray's leaders of carrying out the mass killings, while the TPLF has denied involvement. Ethiopia's human rights commission said it would send a team to investigate. The TPLF dominated Ethiopia's military and political life for decades before Mr Abiy took office in 2018 and pushed through major reforms. Last year, Mr Abiy dissolved the ruling coalition, made up of several ethnically based regional parties, and merged them into a single, national party, which the TPLF refused to join. This video can not be played Four things that explain the crisis in the Tigray region of Ethiopia The feud escalated in September, when Tigray held a regional election, defying a nationwide ban on all polls imposed because of the coronavirus pandemic. Mr Abiy responded by calling the vote illegal. Tigray's administration sees Mr Abiy's reforms as an attempt to hand his central government more power and weaken regional states. It also resents what it calls the prime minister's ""unprincipled"" friendship with Eritrean President Isaias Afwerki. Mr Abiy won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2019 for his efforts to bring peace with Eritrea. The prime minister believes TPLF officials are undermining his authority. Mr Abiy ordered the military operation against the TPLF after he said its fighters had crossed ""the last red line"".  He accused them of attacking a military camp hosting federal troops on 4 November, calling the action ""treasonous"". The TPLF has denied attacking the camp.

"Donald Trump has insisted he is not conceding the US election, despite seemingly acknowledging for the first time that Democrat Joe Biden won. ""He won because the Election was Rigged,"" the Republican president wrote on Twitter, repeating unsubstantiated claims of election fraud. About an hour later he said he was not conceding the 3 November vote. He has launched a slew of lawsuits in key states, but has not provided any evidence to back his claims of fraud. On Friday, election officials said the vote was the ""most secure in American history"" and there was ""no evidence that any voting system deleted or lost votes, changed votes or was in any way compromised"". What legal challenges is Trump planning? How will this endless US election end? The 'dead voters' who are still alive Meanwhile, Mr Biden remains president-elect. The Democrat has 306 votes in the electoral college - the system the US uses to choose its president - which far exceeds the 270 threshold to win. Any recounts or legal challenges are not expected to overturn the overall result. Mr Biden's lead in the popular vote has also surpassed five million. Nevertheless, Mr Trump had refused to acknowledge Mr Biden's victory until - apparently - now. In a news conference on Friday, Mr Trump said ""who knows"" which administration would be in power in the future. His refusal to concede has heightened concerns about the US government's ability, going forward, to tackle growing Covid-19 infection rates. Analysis by Will Grant, BBC News, Washington DC Some Biden supporters consider the president's comments amounted to a form of concession, although it was far from unqualified. ""He won"", began President Trump's initial tweet, before descending into his customary slew of unsubstantiated allegations of electoral fraud. Mr Biden won, continued the president, because there were ""no vote watchers or observers allowed"", repeating his claims of a conspiracy led by the left and the media - while still presenting no evidence. Indeed, within a couple of hours, he contradicted his ""He won"" comment with another tweet, which read: ""He only won in the eyes of the fake news media, I concede nothing."" In essence, that is about as far as President Trump is likely to go. Even if he eventually acknowledges he won't be president from 20 January, he will probably never relinquish his unsubstantiated claims that he was beaten in a fraudulent vote. Twitter added warnings to Mr Trump's latest allegations of wrongdoing on Sunday, saying: ""This claim of election fraud is disputed."" The Trump campaign has launched a series of lawsuits saying Republican poll watchers were wrongly denied access to observe the counting of ballots in key battleground states. Election officials have denied this and insisted rules were followed. Most of the lawsuits have been dismissed over lack of evidence. However, thousands of Mr Trump's supporters protested in Washington DC on Saturday to back his appeals. Flag-carrying demonstrators were joined by members of far-right groups including the Proud Boys, some wearing helmets and bullet-proof vests. The largely peaceful demonstration saw some violence later in the evening, as Trump supporters and counter-protesters clashed in several skirmishes. Officials said 20 people had been arrested on a variety of charges, including assault and weapons possession. One stabbing was reported. Two police officers were also injured. This video can not be played What do Trump supporters think of a Biden presidency? Mr Trump's refusal to concede has stalled the normal handover process to the new government, ahead of the 20 January inauguration. The General Services Administration (GSA), the government agency tasked with beginning the process, has yet to recognise Mr Biden and his running mate Kamala Harris as winners. The Biden team have not been given access to classified security briefings, federal agencies and funding needed to ensure a smooth transition of power. Speaking to NBC on Sunday, Mr Biden's chief of staff, Ron Klain, said the process needed to begin this week to allow the country to focus on tackling the coronavirus pandemic. The US is grappling with some of its worst Covid-19 infection rates since the pandemic began, with more than 180,000 new cases and 1,400 deaths on Friday. The country also has the highest number of infections and deaths in the world, with more than 10.9m cases since the pandemic began. ""Joe Biden's going to become president of the United States in the midst of an ongoing crisis,"" said Mr Klain. ""That has to be a seamless transition."" Leading US infectious diseases expert, Dr Anthony Fauci, echoed his comments, saying it would be better for public health if the transition began immediately.

"This video can not be played President Trump drove through the protest on his way to his golf course Thousands of supporters of US President Donald Trump turned out in Washington DC to back his unsubstantiated claims of voter fraud in the election. Flag-carrying demonstrators were joined by members of far-right groups including the Proud Boys, some wearing helmets and bullet-proof vests. The largely peaceful demonstration saw some violence later in the evening, as Trump supporters and counter-protesters clashed in several skirmishes. Joe Biden won the 3 November election. On Friday, he solidified his victory with a projected win in the state of Georgia - making him the first Democratic candidate to take the state since 1992. He now has 306 votes in the electoral college - the system the US uses to choose its president - which far exceeds the 270 threshold to win. US Election results in full The 'dead voters' who are still alive How will this endless US election end? However, Mr Trump has so far refused to concede. He has launched a flurry of legal challenges in key states and made unsubstantiated allegations of widespread electoral fraud - but his efforts have so far been unsuccessful. This video can not be played What do Trump supporters think of a Biden presidency? Mr Trump's supporters kicked off the demonstrations at about noon local time (17:00 GMT) on Saturday near Freedom Plaza, just east of the White House, and later headed towards the Supreme Court. As well as more mainstream Trump supporters, members of the far-right Proud Boys and the Oath Keepers militia group were among the marchers. Conspiracy theorist Alex Jones addressed the crowd. Who are Proud Boys? Members of far-right, anti-immigrant group Proud Boys marched through downtown Washington Mr Trump's motorcade passed the gathering demonstrators on Saturday morning and did a circuit of nearby Freedom Plaza, but he carried on to his golf club in Sterling, Virginia without addressing the crowds. He laterretweeted video of protesters, posted by White House official Dan Scavino, vowing ""We will WIN!,external"" While the daytime event was largely orderly, Trump supporters clashed with counter-demonstrators in the night. Video footage posted on social media showed fights breaking out. Officials said 20 people had been arrested on a variety of charges, including assault and weapons possession. One stabbing was reported. Two police officers were also injured. At the scene - Will Grant, BBC News, Washington DC A gradual stream of pro-Trump supporters made its way towards Freedom Plaza, adorned with T-shirts and carrying placards which read ""Stop the Steal"" and ""Trump 2020"". The demonstrators were also identifiable by their lack of face-masks as many participants rejected measures to contain the spread of coronavirus. In that regard alone, this pro-Trump rally was seen by its critics as reckless and irresponsible. It took place with the United States grappling with some of its worst Covid-19 infection rates since the pandemic began, with more than 180,000 new cases and 1,400 deaths recorded in the country over the past 24 hours. None of that appeared to matter much to the participants who excitedly greeted President Trump's motorcade as it made an impromptu pass around the plaza. They are desperate to see this election result overturned and fully back his unsubstantiated claims of election fraud and his refusal to concede. Still, although they may deny it, there is a growing sense of a fight losing its energy and that - like it or not - these supporters will see President-elect Joe Biden in the White House in January. The president continues to dispute the election result. In a slew of tweets on Saturday, he said checks on ballots in Georgia were a ""waste of time"", alleging problems with signatures but without giving evidence. A manual recount is to be carried out in Georgia because of the narrow margin between the two candidates, but this is not expected to change the results there. On Friday,election officials said the vote was the ""most secure in American history"", the most direct rebuttal from federal and state authorities of the president's claims. This video can not be played President Trump: ""Who knows which administration it will be. I guess time will tell"" On Friday, White House spokeswoman Kayleigh McEnany told Fox News: ""President Trump believes he will be President Trump, have a second term."" However, Mr Trump's efforts to overturn the result suffered three setbacks on Friday: In Arizona, his team dropped a lawsuit seeking a review of ballots cast on Election Day after it became clear his rival's lead was unassailable. The challenge was based on a claim that some legal votes had been rejected In Michigan, a judge rejected a request by two Republican poll watchers - who had alleged fraud in Wayne County - to block the certification of election results in Detroit In Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, the Trump campaign's requests to invalidate several batches of mail-in ballots were rejected This video can not be played Obama: Claims of election fraud are ""delegitimising"" democracy Pressure is growing on Mr Trump to acknowledge Mr Biden's victory and help prepare the transition from one administration to another. The General Services Administration (GSA), the government agency tasked with beginning the process, has yet to recognise Mr Biden and his running mate Kamala Harris as winners. The Biden team have not been given access to classified security briefings, federal agencies and funding needed to ensure a smooth transition of power. Biden spokesperson Jen Psaki said this lack of access could affect Mr Biden's ability to govern. ""You need real-time information to deal with crises of the moment,"" she said, highlighting the impact of the pandemic. ""It's imperative that our team and our experts have that access."" Adding his voice to those calls, President Trump's former chief of staff, John Kelly, said the delay in starting the transition was hurting national security.""It's not a process where you go from zero to 1,000 miles per hour,"",externalhe told Politico. A small but growing number of Republicans are also backing calls for the president-elect to be given daily intelligence briefings. What happens now?

"Gordon Brown also said the ""middle of a recession"" was not the time to consider a second referendum A referendum on Scottish independence should not be held while the country ""heals"" from coronavirus, former prime minister Gordon Brown has said. Mr Brown said the country was facing ""huge problems"" and should not hold a referendum. ""We're in the middle of a virus, we're in the middle of a recession,""he told BBC's Andrew Marr programme. The SNP's Westminster leader Ian Blackford has said his party ""must"" plan for a referendum in 2021. Mr Blackford tweeted that a vote for the SNP in the Scottish Parliament elections next year would bea vote for a second referendum on Scottish independence,external. ""It is the people of Scotland who will determine our future. That is their right, sovereignty rests with us collectively. A vote for @theSNP in 2021 is for that right to be exercised, we know it, @BorisJohnson knows it,"" he said. Speaking in the Sunday National newspaper,external, Mr Blackford apologised for having to ""put off"" holding a referendum in 2020 as the Scottish government had to focus on its response to the Covid-19 pandemic. But Mr Blackford insisted that a referendum would happen and ""must take place in 2021"". Battle lines drawn again over Scotland's future Forget Indyref2, what about Indyref3? However Gordon Brown said the country needed ""time to heal"" before ""any divisive, conflicting referendum that really will cause consternation in Scotland for months and months to come"". ""The question at the moment is not whether you could have a referendum, the question is whether you should have a referendum,"" the former Labour leader said. ""I see the SNP leader is saying there's got to be a referendum in 2021. I think most Scottish people will make up their mind that in the middle of a virus, when you've got to heal the virus, you've got to heal the recession and you've got to look at the whole future of Britain... I don't think this is the right time at all."" Mr Brown also told the BBC that a ""wholesale, root and branch constitutional review"" was needed to bring people together. ""It's not just a Scottish problem now. It's not even just a Welsh problem and a Scottish problem - you see the revolt of the regions round the United Kingdom,"" he said. 'Indyref2 next year' may be what some increasingly impatient sections of the 'yes' movement want to hear two weeks before the SNP's virtual conference but it seems an unlikely timetable. Firstly, the pandemic will continue into 2021 and dealing with that will remain the overwhelming priority for all governments. Secondly, the Scottish government favours a referendum agreed with the UK governmentwhich has given every indication, so far, that it would refuse. Thirdly, the months available after the Holyrood election in May offer a very tight timetable for organising a referendum to the standards recommended by the Electoral Commission. That's a lot to navigate before you consider the work the SNP has to do to revise its independence plans to take account of whatever new trading relationship with the EU emerges from Brexit. I don't doubt the SNP's determination to push for another referendum. Nicola Sturgeon has promised a draft bill before the election and to put an explicit commitment to indyref2 in her party's manifesto. But that's not the same as actually holding the vote in 2021. The Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross said ""It beggars belief"" that Mr Blackford should suggest that another referendum was needed. He added: ""Ian Blackford's commitment to a referendum a few months from now is not just irresponsible but delusional and shows how out of touch the SNP are. ""The Scottish Conservatives are focusing on fighting the pandemic and rebuilding the economy. That is what people want and expect."" ""They feel they're not listened to, the government doesn't consult. They've got the local knowledge but not the resources. The government's got the resources but not the local knowledge. This is now a UK problem."" Battle lines drawn again over Scotland's future Forget Indyref2, what about Indyref3?

"The Prince of Wales has spoken of the ""enduring connections"" between the UK and Germany as negotiators prepare for post-Brexit trade talks to continue. Prince Charles said though politicians were discussing the ""shape"" of the countries' relationship, their ""fundamental bond"" would remain strong. His wife, Camilla, has joined him on their first official overseas visit since the start of the Covid pandemic. Earlier, they attended a wreath-laying ceremony at a memorial in Berlin. Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall are the first members of the Royal Family to attend the ceremony at the Bundestag, the German parliament, in Berlin, marking the country's National Day of Mourning for victims of war. The prince told those gathered: ""The United Kingdom has chosen a future outside the European Union, and the relationship between our countries is evolving once again. ""Its shape is a matter negotiated between our governments and its essence is defined by the enduring connections between our people. ""It is, therefore, my heartfelt belief that the fundamental bond between us will remain strong: we will always be friends, partners and allies. ""As our countries begin this new chapter in our long history, let us reaffirm our bond for the years ahead."" The speech comes 75 years after the end of World War Two and as post-Brexit trade talksare reaching their crucial final stages. This video can not be played Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall are visiting Berlin to commemorate Germanyâs National Day of Mourning Referring to the English poet John Donne, who wrote that ""no man is an island"", the heir to the throne said: ""One might equally submit that no country is really an island either, other than in the wholly literal sense. ""Our histories bind us tightly together and our destinies, although each our own to forge, are interdependent to a considerable degree."" Earlier on Sunday, Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall were welcomed to Germany by President Frank-Walter Steinmeier and his wife Elke Budenbender on the steps of the Bellevue Palace in Berlin. The four then travelled to the Neue Wache Central Memorial, dedicated to victims of war and tyranny, where a wreath had been laid on behalf of the prince in front of a sculpture titled Mother With Her Dead Son. The sculpture was designed by German artist Kathe Kollwitz in memory of her own son who died in World War One. How Germany remembers the world wars Queen leads scaled-back Remembrance Sunday UK-German relationship will endure Brexit, says Charles Prince Charles warns world leaders over 'hatred' Prince Charles briefly touched the wreath before joining the president and four other German dignitaries in a silence as a trumpet solo echoed through the building. The message on the prince's poppy wreath read: ""In everlasting remembrance of all victims of conflict and tyranny. Charles."" The Prince of Wales and German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier stand in silence along with other dignitaries Camilla then laid a posy featuring rosemary for remembrance and olive, white daisies and nerines for peace.

The royal couple flew to Germany in the refurbished ministerial RAF Voyager jet The Royal Family have carried out a number of European visits since the UK voted to leave the EU in 2016. During a tour of Germany in May last year,Prince Charles said the bonds between the UK and Germany ""will, and must endure"" post-Brexit. And when his son, the Duke of Cambridge, visited the country in 2016, William said the depth of Britain's friendship with Germany would not change after the UK left the EU.

"Sir Keir said his name - named after Labour Party founder Keir Hardie - earned him ""plenty of nicknames"" at school Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer has spoken of his regret at not being close to his late father, who he described as a ""difficult"" and ""complicated"" man. He told Lauren Laverne on BBC Radio 4's Desert Island Discs, that he was ""determined that my relationship with my own children will be different"". In the interview, Sir Keir also talked about how his political beliefs had shifted, and his aim to unite Labour. And he spoke about his love of football, saying he plays every week. Among the songs that Sir Keir chose were the England football anthem Three Lions by The Lightning Seeds, and Jim Reeves' Welcome To My World, which was his mother's favourite song. He also picked a Northern Soul record - Dobie Gray's Out On The Floor - saying it reminded him of his ""early days in London with a group of friends in a really grotty flat above a sauna and massage parlour that kept interesting hours"". Listen: Keir Starmer on Desert Island Discs Who is Sir Keir Starmer? Asked by presenter Lauren Laverne about his parents and upbringing in Oxted, Surrey, Sir Keir, 58, said: ""I don't often talk about my dad."" ""He was a difficult man, a complicated man, he kept himself to himself, he didn't particularly like to socialise, so wouldn't really go out very much. But he was incredibly hard-working."" Sir Keir said his father worked as a toolmaker in a factory and would work 14-hour days, coming home for an hour at 17:00 ""for his tea"" before returning to work again in the evening. ""But he had this utter devotion and commitment to my mum,"" said Sir Keir. ""My mum was very, very ill all of her life and my dad knew exactly the symptoms of everything that might possibly go wrong with my mum, he knew exactly what drugs or combination of drugs or injection would be needed. ""He stopped drinking completely just in case he ever needed to get to the hospital with her. On the many occasions she was in hospital he would stay with her the whole time, he wouldn't leave the hospital, he would sleep on any chair or whatever was available."" But Sir Keir adds: ""I wouldn't say we were close. I understood who he was and what he was but we weren't close and I regret that."" Ten years ago, pre-politics, Sir Keir was the Director of Public Prosecutions Sir Keir grew emotional when speaking about his mother - who had lived with the autoimmune condition Still's Disease since she was 11 - as he recalled when his father had phoned from the hospital to say: ""I don't think your mum's going to make it."" He said his mother died just a few weeks before he was elected into Parliament as an MP in 2015, and his father died a couple of years ago. Sir Keir's parents were ""Labour through and through"" but he said they did not have discussions about politics around the kitchen table. Sir Keir said his politics had changed over the years but he still considered himself to be a socialist, adding: ""Like most people, I started off as the radical who knew everything. I'm now much more open to ideas."" The former human rights lawyer and Director of Public Prosecutions also spoke about his aim for a ""united Labour Party"" and also addressed therecent decision to suspend former leader Jeremy Corbynfrom the party. ""I didn't want that day to end in the way it did,"" he said, of the day the report into anti-Semitism in Labour was published. ""I had no intention of purging anyone. I have no intention of purging anyone. I want the Labour Party to be a broad church."" He added being named Keir - after Keir Hardie, founder of the Labour Party - earned him ""plenty of nicknames at school"". ""I have to say at school, I was saying 'why on earth did you have to call me Keir? Why couldn't you have called me Pete or Dave or something like everybody else',"" he said.

"Gordon Brown also said the ""middle of a recession"" was not the time to consider a second referendum A referendum on Scottish independence should not be held while the country ""heals"" from coronavirus, former prime minister Gordon Brown has said. Mr Brown said the country was facing ""huge problems"" and should not hold a referendum. ""We're in the middle of a virus, we're in the middle of a recession,""he told BBC's Andrew Marr programme. The SNP's Westminster leader Ian Blackford has said his party ""must"" plan for a referendum in 2021. Mr Blackford tweeted that a vote for the SNP in the Scottish Parliament elections next year would bea vote for a second referendum on Scottish independence,external. ""It is the people of Scotland who will determine our future. That is their right, sovereignty rests with us collectively. A vote for @theSNP in 2021 is for that right to be exercised, we know it, @BorisJohnson knows it,"" he said. Speaking in the Sunday National newspaper,external, Mr Blackford apologised for having to ""put off"" holding a referendum in 2020 as the Scottish government had to focus on its response to the Covid-19 pandemic. But Mr Blackford insisted that a referendum would happen and ""must take place in 2021"". Battle lines drawn again over Scotland's future Forget Indyref2, what about Indyref3? However Gordon Brown said the country needed ""time to heal"" before ""any divisive, conflicting referendum that really will cause consternation in Scotland for months and months to come"". ""The question at the moment is not whether you could have a referendum, the question is whether you should have a referendum,"" the former Labour leader said. ""I see the SNP leader is saying there's got to be a referendum in 2021. I think most Scottish people will make up their mind that in the middle of a virus, when you've got to heal the virus, you've got to heal the recession and you've got to look at the whole future of Britain... I don't think this is the right time at all."" Mr Brown also told the BBC that a ""wholesale, root and branch constitutional review"" was needed to bring people together. ""It's not just a Scottish problem now. It's not even just a Welsh problem and a Scottish problem - you see the revolt of the regions round the United Kingdom,"" he said. 'Indyref2 next year' may be what some increasingly impatient sections of the 'yes' movement want to hear two weeks before the SNP's virtual conference but it seems an unlikely timetable. Firstly, the pandemic will continue into 2021 and dealing with that will remain the overwhelming priority for all governments. Secondly, the Scottish government favours a referendum agreed with the UK governmentwhich has given every indication, so far, that it would refuse. Thirdly, the months available after the Holyrood election in May offer a very tight timetable for organising a referendum to the standards recommended by the Electoral Commission. That's a lot to navigate before you consider the work the SNP has to do to revise its independence plans to take account of whatever new trading relationship with the EU emerges from Brexit. I don't doubt the SNP's determination to push for another referendum. Nicola Sturgeon has promised a draft bill before the election and to put an explicit commitment to indyref2 in her party's manifesto. But that's not the same as actually holding the vote in 2021. The Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross said ""It beggars belief"" that Mr Blackford should suggest that another referendum was needed. He added: ""Ian Blackford's commitment to a referendum a few months from now is not just irresponsible but delusional and shows how out of touch the SNP are. ""The Scottish Conservatives are focusing on fighting the pandemic and rebuilding the economy. That is what people want and expect."" ""They feel they're not listened to, the government doesn't consult. They've got the local knowledge but not the resources. The government's got the resources but not the local knowledge. This is now a UK problem."" Battle lines drawn again over Scotland's future Forget Indyref2, what about Indyref3?

" The real Lewis Hamilton story By Andrew Benson By Andrew Benson  Lewis Hamilton set the world on fire on his very first serious run in a Formula 1 car. At Silverstone, in September 2006, a 21-year-old Hamilton was given an evaluation test by McLaren as the team pondered his promotion to F1 the following year. McLaren’s then race driver Pedro de la Rosa was there as a benchmark. The engineers preparing the car knew Hamilton had talent - the team had been supporting his career for the past eight years - but they were expecting him, like most other drivers, to need time to adjust to the extreme demands of a grand prix car. They were wrong. After a couple of familiarisation runs, Hamilton was given a set of new tyres, and immediately he was matching De la Rosa’s times. “Just looking at the data for a couple of seconds,” De la Rosa recalls, “I realised we had a massive problem - me and all the other drivers on the grid. The test team reported back to the factory that Hamilton was “incredible”, and before long his place in the team for 2007, as team-mate to double world champion Fernando Alonso, was confirmed. It was, says Martin Whitmarsh, McLaren’s chief executive officer at the time, “one of the easier decisions”. Formula 1’s greatest debut season followed. Hamilton was unlucky not to win the title, but made amends a year later as one of the most dramatic finales in sporting history made him - at the time - the youngest ever F1 world champion. Year after year, Hamilton has gone on producing moments that have been carved into F1 legend. Jaw-dropping qualifying laps and remarkable race drives continuing through the campaigns with McLaren and his later move to Mercedes, where he has not only dominated on track for the past seven years but become a global icon with a reach far beyond his sport. There have been a few controversies along the way, too. According to many of those who have shared the journey with him, Hamilton is fair, generous, respectful, honest and honourable, but also ruthless, focused, self-obsessed and ultra-competitive; insular and intense but also warm and open. And now, he is the most successful driver in the history of F1. He broke Michael Schumacher’s record of 91 wins last month, has equalled the German's record of seven world championships - and has every chance of adding an eighth next year. This is how he did it. Hamilton’s road to unprecedented success started at Rye House, an unassuming little go-kart track tucked between a supermarket distribution centre and a nature reserve at the junction of two railway lines just off the A10 in Hertfordshire. It was there Hamilton went aged eight, with his father Anthony and a second-hand kart, and took his first step on to the motorsport ladder. He immediately stood out. Not only because he was good - and he was - but because he did not look like any of the other kids he was racing. Motor racing - like many sports that require financial input or attract the wealthier members of society - is notoriously undiverse. Formula 1 had never had a black driver. Hamilton’s family were neither wealthy, nor white. His grandparents came to the UK from the Caribbean island of Grenada in the 1950s. Anthony grew up in west London, married a white woman, Carmen, and they had Lewis in January 1985, but spilt up when he was two. Anthony lived in a council house in Stevenage and worked in IT for the railways. He took on extra jobs to supplement his income to find the money to support Lewis’s racing - selling double glazing, washing dishes, putting up ‘for sale’ boards for estate agents and so on. “I had to buy a trailer to put the go-kart on and spare tyres, this, that and the other,” Anthony recalls. Money was not the only problem. The Hamiltons were usually the only black people at races, and there was racial abuse. “The first time it happened,” a young Hamilton told the BBC at the time, “I felt really upset and told my mum and dad. I felt like I needed to get revenge, but lately, if anyone says anything to me, I just ignore them and get them back on the track.” Aged 10, Hamilton became the youngest ever winner of the British cadet kart championship. That year, in 1995, he attended the Autosport Awards, the motorsport industry’s end-of-season shindig. He walked up to Ron Dennis, the boss of McLaren, introduced himself and said: “One day, I want to be racing your cars.” Three years later, after Hamilton had won his second British kart championship, Dennis signed him up to McLaren’s driver development programme. Whitmarsh was put in charge of overseeing Hamilton’s career. “He had this youthful, naive, warm personality about him. You wanted him to make it,” Whitmarsh recalls. “I don’t know whether I could have said back then that he was going to be a multiple world champion, you just saw that he was a really likeable kid who came from a modest background, had a pretty pushy father. “He wasn’t arrogant or cocky. There are a few things he’s done in his life where from afar you think, ‘Oh, God, Lewis…’ but actually he’s not bad. He’s got a sincere humility about him. That lad came up and you thought, ‘There's something here. It’s got to be worth a punt.’” Before long, success started to come - but not, at times, fast enough for either Hamilton or his father. Hamilton won the UK Formula Renault Championship in 2003, and after finishing fourth in the Formula 3 Euroseries the following year, he and his father wanted to move straight up to GP2, then the final category before F1. Whitmarsh disagreed. He thought Hamilton would learn more by staying in F3 and dominating the championship in 2005. “We had a huge row,” Whitmarsh recalls. “I was accused of ruining his career by holding him back in F3. By that time, Lewis was getting a bit of traction and his father felt there were other options. In the end, I took the contract out and tore it up. “I freed them. I said, ‘I don’t want you here under duress. We want to work with you. This is what I really want you to do. If you don’t want to do it…’ “It was about six weeks before Lewis rang me and we re-signed. Hamilton did what was asked of him, dominating European F3 in 2005 before moving up to GP2 in 2006 and driving one of the most impressive seasons the championship - now known as Formula 2 - has ever seen. F1 beckoned. Alonso, who had joined McLaren for 2007 after winning two consecutive titles with Renault, was unimpressed when he was told his new team-mate would be a novice. Whitmarsh says: “Fernando was, ‘Well, why are we doing that? If we’re going to try to win the championship, we don’t need a kid in the car, we need someone experienced. I need a strong team-mate; we don’t need a rookie.’ But it turned out to be quite a different story.” What followed was a dramatic, tumultuous season in which arguably the strongest driver pairing ever put together in F1 came close to tearing McLaren apart. Hamilton was on the podium for his first nine consecutive races, and won his seventh. The Italian media took to calling him ‘Il Fenomeno’ - the phenomenon. At McLaren, the tension was rising. As the man who had ended Schumacher’s domination of F1 with Ferrari, Alonso had established himself as the sport’s leading driver. Although it wasn’t in his contract, the Spaniard felt his status demanded he be McLaren’s team leader and designated championship contender. Hamilton had other ideas. At the first race of the season, Alonso qualified second and Hamilton fourth, but at the start Hamilton pulled a move that set the tone for what was to come. He passed his team-mate around the outside of the first corner and ran confidently ahead of him for two thirds of the race. In the end, Alonso finished second behind Ferrari’s Kimi Raikkonen, with Hamilton third, but the ‘kid’ had left a huge impression. And it just kept growing. “He turned out to be the best rookie there has ever been,” says Paddy Lowe, then McLaren’s technical director. “Because actually, more remarkable almost than seven championships and the most wins, his first half-season is just the most extraordinary in history.” Hamilton first led the championship after the fourth race of the season, taking it away from Alonso at the Spaniard’s home grand prix. The problems that led to the team unravelling began at the next race in Monaco. Alonso dominated the race from pole, building a sizeable lead over Hamilton. After both drivers had made their final pit stops, Alonso backed off to cruise to the end. Both had been told to be wary of overheating rear brake calipers. But Hamilton closed up to his team-mate and started pressuring him. With a one-two in the bag, and no prospect of Hamilton passing Alonso, the team ordered Hamilton to slow down. He refused, and after the race made a point of revealing his disgruntlement to the world. “It started to go wrong there,” Whitmarsh says. “Lewis should have on that occasion heeded the instructions of the team not to take excessive risk. “But in fairness to him, he hadn’t had a win at that stage and he was hungry to have one. Hamilton’s maiden win did follow soon after, in dominant fashion at the very next race in Canada. Through that long, tense summer, the advantage swung back and forth between him and Alonso, with Raikkonen and his Ferrari team-mate Felipe Massa also in the mix for the championship. Adding to the pressure, the title battle took place against the political backdrop of the ‘spy-gate’ case, in which McLaren’s chief designer had been found in possession of 780 pages of confidential Ferrari technical information. The next flashpoint was the Hungarian Grand Prix. What was meant to happen was for Alonso to run first on track ahead of Hamilton during qualifying. McLaren had been alternating which of their drivers would benefit from a complex 2007 rule relating to fuel loads, and it was Alonso’s turn. Instead, Hamilton went out ahead and refused repeated requests over the radio to let Alonso through. This put Alonso at a disadvantage in the fight for pole. Alonso worked out what was going on and made sure he came into the pits first before their final laps. As Alonso’s new tyres were being fitted, Hamilton was waiting behind for his. With the work quickly finished, Alonso then held his car, having calculated how long he would need to block Hamilton to make sure he wouldn’t be able to start his final lap. When he was certain Hamilton was out of time, only then did he pull away. All hell broke loose. Dennis threw his headphones down in disgust and went over to remonstrate with Alonso’s trainer, who he wrongly believed was involved. The drivers were called to the stewards, who also received a visit from Anthony Hamilton. Alonso was given a five-place grid penalty. The next morning, still furious, Alonso met Dennis and threatened to go to the FIA with information pertaining to the spy-gate case unless the team disadvantaged Hamilton in the race. Alonso later withdrew the threat, but it was too late. His relationship with McLaren was now irrevocably broken. A contract that had been meant to run for three years would be terminated by mutual consent at the end of the year. “Lewis didn’t co-operate with the team or Fernando and that was straightforward disobeying,” Whitmarsh says. “He impetuously wanted to win. “You wanted a driver who if your daughter brought them home, you’d think, ‘Oh, God, she’s going to get hurt,’ because they’re so selfish and self-possessed. “As much as I love Lewis to death, would I be happy for my daughter to bring him home? No. As part of the complex equation of talent, intensity, focus, they also have to have a bit of ruthlessness. “Lewis had that and he was bloody young. Would he be any different today? Probably not. And that was it, just bloody minded.” Hamilton won that race, but finished off the podium in both Turkey and Belgium, either side of a second place behind Alonso in Italy. A brilliant win in Japan followed, in torrential rain that caused Alonso to crash, and Hamilton went to the penultimate race in China with a chance of clinching the title in his debut season. Instead, McLaren “just got it wrong”, in Whitmarsh’s words. Hamilton led from pole on a drying track, but the team left him out for too long on worn tyres. When he was finally called into the pits, tyres down to the canvas, he slid off the track in the pit lane and was beached in a gravel trap. Raikkonen won from Alonso. That left Hamilton leading the championship by four points from Alonso and seven from Raikkonen going into the decider in Brazil, in October 2007. It should have been enough, but Hamilton’s hopes disintegrated. After qualifying second behind Massa, his first lap was messy. He lost places to Raikkonen and Alonso in the first couple of corners, then ran off the track trying to pass Alonso around the outside of Turn Four, dropping to eighth. Hamilton was up to sixth within four laps, but then his car suffered a problem with a hydraulic valve. It was blocked for 25 seconds, during which time the car was stuck in fourth gear.  The blockage flushed through but by then Hamilton had dropped to 18th place. Massa dominated the race but Ferrari held him at his final pit stop long enough to gift Raikkonen the victory. It was just enough for the Finn to take the title, with Hamilton and Alonso one point behind. Had Massa won, as he would have without team intervention, Hamilton would have been champion on results count back. With Raikkonen winning, Hamilton needed fifth place. He finished two positions short. Looking back now, Hamilton says: ""I remember the build-up to those races at the end and the pressure was there. That was not needed. If I knew then what I know now, I would have easily won that championship, I think. I have learnt not to add pressure that’s unnecessary."" The heartbreak of losing was countered by the knowledge that nobody had ever performed better in a debut season. And everyone knew there was much more to come. A year later, Hamilton was back in Brazil, with another championship on the line, Sao Paulo native Massa his rival. Memories of the championship slipping through their fingers a year before were still fresh and painful at McLaren. And then, at a public appearance the night before the race, someone threw a toy black cat on to the stage in front of Hamilton. “It really spooked Lewis,” Whitmarsh recalls. “I remember going up to see him in his room on the Saturday night. Closing out the championship, after what had happened the year before… That was a time I felt we needed to be a little bit gentle and supportive. “Most of the time, you didn’t need to - Lewis knew what he was capable of, and quietly had that self-belief.” It was an agonising weekend. McLaren, knowing Hamilton needed only to finish fifth to clinch the title even if Massa won, took an overly conservative approach, Lowe admits.  It led to one of the most spectacular finishes the sport has ever seen. Hamilton qualified fourth and in damp conditions kept that position at the start as Massa led through two sets of pit stops on a drying track. Late in the race, there was more rain. Most of the drivers stopped for wet-weather tyres, but Toyota’s Timo Glock did not and that vaulted the German up the field, with Hamilton dropping to fifth. The rain came down more heavily with two laps to go, and Hamilton ran wide, letting Sebastian Vettel’s Toro Rosso slip ahead into fifth place. Now the title was in Massa’s hands. Hamilton fought to re-pass Vettel but couldn’t. As they went around the final lap, it appeared as if it was all over. Massa was about to win and Hamilton, one place short of the minimum result he needed, was on the verge of missing out for the second year in a row. “I don’t know what Lewis was feeling in the car,” Lowe says, “but we just couldn’t believe we were having a repeat of the previous year. It was like, ‘God, what do we have to do around here to win a championship?’” As Massa crossed the line, Hamilton was still sixth. In the Ferrari pit, they celebrated what they thought was the world championship. But out on track Glock was struggling in the wet on his worn slick tyres and Hamilton was catching, catching. He passed the Toyota as it slithered, gripless, out of the final corner, to take the fifth place he needed to clinch his first title. As the celebrations abruptly halted in the Ferrari pit, at McLaren they went wild, Hamilton’s family - father Anthony, half-brother Nicolas and pop star girlfriend Nicole Scherzinger - with them. “That was quite a moment for me and him and everybody in the team,” Lowe says. “For two minutes I was going to give up F1.” Hamilton had made history, at the end of an up-and-down year that provided a number of standout moments. One in particular remains to this day one of his finest victories. The British Grand Prix in 2008 was wet and Hamilton was out of this world, in a league way beyond anyone else on track that day. As conditions ebbed and flowed, Hamilton was at times lapping five seconds faster than any other car. He won by a minute and eight seconds. Massa spun five times. Only two other drivers finished on the same lap. Hamilton’s team-mate, Heikki Kovalainen, who finished fifth, was not one of them. It was a performance to compare with some of the greatest wet-weather drives in history - Jackie Stewart winning by four minutes at the Nurburgring in 1968; Ayrton Senna’s maiden victory in Portugal in 1985; Schumacher’s first win for Ferrari in Spain in 1996. Hamilton has produced many similar performances over the years, where he is on another level beyond his rivals. How does he do it? Driving an F1 car involves skills that most ordinary people find difficult to comprehend. After braking at the very latest point possible, the driver is balancing on the edge of adhesion at all times during cornering, in an exercise that could perhaps be likened to walking a tightrope at 100mph down a steep hill around a corner in high wind. It is an activity that, in the words of Mercedes technical director James Allison, requires “sublime delicacy and unbelievable levels of concentration and precision”. As McLaren’s test driver from 2007-9, De la Rosa witnessed Hamilton’s abilities closer than most. Having worked with both, he rates Hamilton and Alonso as the two best drivers he has ever seen first hand - including Schumacher. Where they differentiate themselves from the rest, he says, is in the entry phase of a corner. “Where they are special, Lewis and Fernando, is how much speed they can run into the apex and still have a decent exit speed,” he says. “It is very easy to say; it is very difficult to do. “Most drivers, over one lap, when the rear tyres are at their peak grip, can do that. So if you look at [Hamilton’s current Mercedes team-mate Valtteri] Bottas, for example, over one lap many times he is matching Lewis. Lowe says an ability to control his car in this way not only “makes you go faster in the moment, but also allows you to set the car up to be nearer the limit, so it is inherently quicker”. These skills also explain why Hamilton is often so much more effective in races than Bottas, when it comes to key techniques such as following another car closely, overtaking or keeping tyres in optimum condition. “Some drivers cannot get that close to the car in front,” De la Rosa says. ""But Lewis and Fernando, always, when they’re behind they’re nearly touching the gearbox. “You can see they are following in a different manner, in an aggressive manner, in a way that is not comfortable at all for the car in front. “You lose a lot of grip when you are following - especially with these modern F1 cars - but this type of driver knows how to compensate by balancing with speed and brakes. “It doesn’t really matter if the car is understeering or oversteering, they will sort the balance out with their feeling. They don’t know why they are doing it. They just know it’s faster. And that’s all talent - pure, raw talent.” Ability, though, is not all it takes to win in F1. If an inferior driver has an inherently superior car, there is nothing even someone as good as Hamilton can do about it. Over the final four seasons of Hamilton’s time at McLaren, from 2009 to 2012, the machinery did not always match his standard, as Red Bull embarked on four years of domination with Vettel. On top of that, Hamilton was growing up in the public eye, and personal problems at times affected his professional life. In 2010, Hamilton told his father he no longer wanted him to be his manager, and the two didn’t speak for a while. “It was the worst time of my life,” Anthony says. ""It’s difficult to explain it. I think I probably was too much of an ogre. It was, ‘Lewis, do this, do that.’ And it was, ‘Come on, Dad, I’m a grown man.’ “That’s probably when he rebelled. He didn’t do it when he was 15. He did it when he was a world champion and it was all my fault because as a parent I forgot how to let go. And Lewis said, ‘Do you know what, Dad? I have to go and do my own thing.’” Then, in early 2011, Hamilton split with Scherzinger. “He was very upset about that,” says Matt Bishop, then McLaren’s communications director. “He did love Nicole.” Hamilton was destabilised, and in 2011 he made an uncharacteristic series of mistakes, many of them crashes with Massa. At the time, it seemed that perhaps no incident better summed up Hamilton’s anguished state of mind than what happened in Monaco, where he finished sixth after being hit with two penalties for incidents during the race. ”It's an absolute frickin' joke,"" he said afterwards. ""I've been to see the stewards five times out of six this season.” Asked why he thought that was the case, he replied: “Maybe it's because I'm black. That's what Ali G says.” The remark caused a storm. Chief steward Lars Osterlind and FIA president Jean Todt took offence at the implication Hamilton’s skin colour had been an influence in the decisions. For a while there was a chance Hamilton might be banned from a number of races. In the end, McLaren officials convinced Hamilton to issue a statement saying he “never meant to offend anyone”, and the matter was quietly dropped. Looking back through the prism of what Hamilton has become, the racial abuse he suffered early in his career, and the anti-racism stance he has taken this year, the incident takes on a different light. It’s clear now that the fact Hamilton is F1’s only black competitor has never been far from the front of his mind. His Mercedes team boss Toto Wolff says: “That was a year or two ago, and it triggered a profound reflection within me, because we as a majority white people in European countries, you never think about it. “Imagine you enter the paddock and you are the only white person and how difficult that would be. I guess it would make you think about your skin colour every day. And if you add abuse and racism to the whole equation, it becomes unbearable. This is what he and many others around the world are facing every day.” Whitmarsh, who has been appointed as one of the members of the commission Hamilton has set up to look into the lack of diversity in the UK motorsport industry, points out that a very similar incident to Monaco 2011 almost happened at this year’s Russian Grand Prix, when Hamilton accused F1 bosses of “trying to stop me” after he was given a penalty for two illegal practice starts. “One of the learnings I’m having right now,” Whitmarsh says, “is that I have gone through life not taking racism seriously enough. Because it hasn’t affected me; I haven’t witnessed it close hand. “And I therefore do think that if you have experienced racism in your life at any point - and sadly if you’re black or not white in a predominantly white society, you have probably experienced it more than people realise - it must then subconsciously be in your mind as to why people appear to not be giving you the rub in critical situations. “Lewis is super-competitive and super-ruthless. It really deeply hurts him if he doesn’t win the race on Sunday afternoon, and he is going to look for reasons - within himself, the team, the tyres, the officials, whatever. He is going to be looking for that reason because he has that passion, that strong desire, that will and that need to win.” In the end, the lack of a second championship at McLaren got to Hamilton and he started looking for a move away. From early 2012, he was courted by Mercedes, then led by team boss Ross Brawn and commercial director Nick Fry. At the time, McLaren had a faster car, and Mercedes had struggled in the three years since they took over the title-winning Brawn team at the end of 2009. Few expected Hamilton to make the jump. But jump he did. At the time, Hamilton talked of needing a change, a fresh challenge and his belief in Mercedes’ chances of success in the future, and he gives the same reasons now. All of that was true, but there was more to the decision, too. Late that summer, Hamilton had a massive falling out with Dennis, who had made some damaging personal accusations about his driver to Daimler boss Dieter Zetsche in a vain attempt to stop Mercedes signing him. When Dennis’ actions made their way back to Hamilton via intermediaries, he was furious, and his relationship with Dennis was, in his mind, over. It remained that way for a long period; only in recent times have they extended olive branches to each other. Hamilton, then aged 27, felt loyalty to McLaren, but much of him now wanted to get away. Fry tells of an exhausting few days as negotiations over the detail of the Mercedes contract reached their critical point over the weekend of the Singapore Grand Prix, in September 2012. Mercedes were initially some £3-4m short of the £30m fee Hamilton and his then manager Simon Fuller were demanding. They had to lean on title sponsor Petronas for more funds. There was a negotiation over the use of Hamilton’s image rights. Hamilton led the race in his McLaren, only for his gearbox to fail, gifting victory to Vettel. He had a final meeting with Mercedes non-executive chairman Niki Lauda in his hotel room. By the end of the weekend, a deal had been put together on which all parties had agreed. Hamilton flew to Thailand for a holiday before the next race in Japan. The contract was sent over to him from Mercedes via his lawyer, Sue Thackeray. There was silence for a few days. And then he made his decision. He called Whitmarsh to tell him he was leaving. “That was one of the most difficult moments,” Hamilton says now. “I have been a very loyal person, I had been with McLaren since I was 13, so to decide to leave a team that had given me a place in the sport and to call your boss and tell them you’re leaving was damaging and emotionally difficult.” Whitmarsh says: “He was very cosseted at McLaren, very controlled by two individuals he wanted to divorce himself from [his father and Dennis]. They had contributed to his growth but then ultimately limited his growth. I think he had the belief that he had to become his own man, and he had to be able to survive and grow further without those two dominant characters. “It was the most difficult decision of his life. He was emotional about it. But at the time, I sensed it was the right decision for him, and subsequently it’s proven to be just that.” On a grey and humid Saturday afternoon at Japan’s Suzuka circuit, Hamilton’s 2016 championship hopes were unravelling before the world’s eyes. A couple of hours before, his Mercedes team-mate Nico Rosberg had beaten him to pole position by 0.013 seconds. Now, the F1 media filed in to Mercedes’ base in the paddock to hear Hamilton’s thoughts. They would hear them, but not in the way they expected. Hamilton made a short speech, in which he talked about a lack of respect, revealed his lack of enthusiasm for any questions, and walked out. To explain why, we have to rewind a little.  Hamilton’s move to Mercedes had paid off better and earlier than he ever expected. After a building year in 2013, the advent of F1’s hybrid engine regulations brought immediate success, and a car miles clear of the rest of the field. Hamilton won the championship in 2014 and 2015. In 2014, he did it the hard way, three times overhauling a points advantage built up by Rosberg while Hamilton suffered problems. In 2015, he won his third title at a canter, dominating from the start and clinching the championship with three races to go. It looked like there was no stopping him, but 2016 turned into a repeat of 2014 - only worse. A bad start at the opening race of the season followed by engine failures in qualifying at two of the next three grands prix put Hamilton on the back foot, 43 points behind Rosberg after just four races. Just as two years before, Hamilton clawed it back. There were hiccups along the way - a bad start here and there, an off weekend in Azerbaijan - but by late summer he was in the championship lead, only for a grid penalty at the Belgian Grand Prix, a legacy of earlier engine failures, to knock him back again. Then another difficult weekend for Hamilton in Singapore - where he just never seemed to get it together - put Rosberg back in front. But as Hamilton led the next race in Malaysia, Singapore was behind him. Winning would give him a comfortable lead, one he was sure he could hold on to for the remainder of the year. And then his engine went bang. Again. “Oh no,” he screamed over the team radio, before kneeling down beside the smoking car, helmet in his hands. Hamilton just couldn’t believe it. Why were all these problems happening to him? Not long after getting out of the car, he said to the television cameras: Was he alluding to a conspiracy theory within Mercedes to allow Rosberg to win? An hour or so later, he clarified what he meant: “A higher power. It feels right now as if the man above or a higher power is intervening a little bit.” A couple of days later, he took to Instagram with a series of posts praising the team. After arriving at Suzuka, he cut a distracted figure at the official news conference before the Japanese Grand Prix, refusing to engage with questions, repeatedly referring journalists back to his social media posts, and spending his time posting pictures of himself and fellow drivers on Snapchat using the animal-face filter. The British newspapers were not impressed, and there followed a series of pieces criticising Hamilton’s behaviour. “Snap prat” was the headline in the Sun. Shortly after the news conference, Rosberg bumped into a journalist, who informed him of what had gone on. “Did he?” said the German. “Good.” Rosberg sensed an opportunity. The maths of the championship were clear - if he could win in Japan, he would have enough of a lead to finish second behind Hamilton at all the remaining races and still win the title. Which, given the size of Mercedes’ advantage over the field, should be relatively easy, reliability permitting. Rosberg was fastest throughout the weekend, and just held off Hamilton for pole. Which brings us back to Hamilton’s post-session news conference. “I’m not here to answer your questions, I’ve decided,” he said. “The other day was a super light-hearted thing, and if I was disrespectful to any of you guys, or if you felt I was disrespectful, it was honestly not the intention. It was just a little bit of fun. But what was more disrespectful was what was then written worldwide. “I don’t really plan on sitting here many more times for these kind of things. So my apologies, and I hope you guys enjoy the rest of your weekend.” The next day, before the race, Hamilton fussed over a damp patch on the track near his grid slot, and made a bad start, finishing only third behind Rosberg and Red Bull’s Max Verstappen. Rosberg’s lead was out to 33 points and there were four races left. All Hamilton could do now was win them all, and hope that some misfortune befell Rosberg in one of them. Hamilton did win them - but it wasn’t enough. At the final race in Abu Dhabi, Hamilton made it difficult for his team-mate, putting him under pressure by backing him towards Vettel’s Ferrari, but Rosberg held on to seal the championship. “I saw Nico when he got back to the garage and we were sort of out of sight,” Lowe says. “He just hugged me and burst into tears and said, ‘That was so terrible. It was so difficult.’ It was Lewis’s mastery of the situation, without being unsporting.” After the race in Abu Dhabi, Hamilton wasted no time in pointing out that he had lost the championship because of the skewed reliability record between the two, but in the garage Lowe - who had moved to Mercedes at the same time as Hamilton - sensed his defeat would prove to be bad news for the rest of the grid. “What he has learned and become better at, and now unbeatable because of, is to be always present at 110%,” Lowe says. “I remember at the time thinking, ‘Well, that’s just never going to happen again. Lewis is now unbeatable because he’s gonna turn up at maximum performance for every event.’” That season finished Rosberg off. It had taken so much effort, focus and commitment to beat Hamilton to the championship, even with all the luck that had gone his way, using every trick he knew, on-track and off, psychological games and more, that he decided he couldn’t face going through it again. His lifetime ambition achieved, he quit at the end of the season. Rosberg knew he wouldn’t beat Hamilton again. The question now was, who could? When he came back in 2017, with a new team-mate in Bottas, Hamilton never again brought up the engine failures and reliability issues when he was discussing 2016, only his own errors. A lesson had been learned, never to be forgotten. Since then, his driving has risen to a new level. The speed remains, now married to a new solidity and consistency. He has been unstoppable, even when he has not had the best equipment. Hamilton has identified what he sees as his weaknesses - the bad starts and off weekends in 2016, the comparative struggles at times in qualifying of 2019 - and worked on them, while retaining all the strengths he has always had. It has become hard to pick any flaws in his game. “His ability to question himself and to develop is really amazing,” Wolff says. “It is not something you see very often in champions. “I guess many other people who become world champion or win a great title there are several risks - a sense of entitlement, a certain complacency which kicks in, which is perfectly understandable. The driving force behind what Wolff calls this “relentless push for perfection” is Hamilton’s intense hatred of losing. His former team-mate De la Rosa saw it up close. “Every winter we went to Finland for a week’s training camp,” De la Rosa recalls of their time together at McLaren. “He was so competitive, man. It’s unbelievable. “No matter what sport we played, Lewis always had to win, and he was so good at everything. He’s just naturally talented for any sport. If we were climbing, he was the best from the team. Whatever we did, it was, ‘Man, Lewis again winning.’ It was a bit embarrassing. “The only sport I beat him in was tennis. It was the only thing I have ever beaten Lewis at, and only in one game, because he realised he had no chance against me, so he never, ever wanted to play against me again.” Mercedes chief engineer Andrew Shovlin adds: “You can’t ask Lewis to be happy when he’s lost a race; that’s not how he works. But he loses really well if you want someone to come back and win the next one. “He’s actually better at losing than most I’ve seen because of how diligently he goes through the block of work of understanding what he needs to be better, where did he miss the opportunities. He doesn’t enjoy it, but it’s about the result at the next race, not whether he’s smiling or giving a nice interview. “Lewis has natural talent in abundance, but his work ethic and ability to continually develop and improve means that, for drivers trying to beat him, he’s a bit of a moving target. Allison has worked alongside Schumacher, Alonso, Vettel and Hamilton in a 30-year career. He says: “Useless parlour game though it is, I personally think Lewis is the finest of them. “As a racing car driver, I think he’s the fastest and most likely to win any championship between the world champions I’ve been lucky enough to work with. “But it’s not just that. The thing I find remarkable about him is he’s as much of a carnivore as the rest of them in his dogged need to win. But he’s got a line, and it’s a line all the rest of us would want to admire in the way he handles himself as a sportsman and the way he interacts with us as a man. That’s what sets him apart in my mind and why I think I’ll always have a soft spot for him.” The combination of the greatest F1 team ever assembled with one of the fastest and best drivers of all time, both of whom share an unquenchable desire to push on to the next level, has led to unprecedented levels of success at Mercedes. And the more Hamilton has had, the more he has had his eyes opened to what he can do with it. Over the past few years, Hamilton has become increasingly vocal on causes that matter to him. It started with environmentalism, then veganism, which grew out of his concerns for the health of the planet. Then, as the death of George Floyd at the hands of US police sparked a global outcry in the summer of 2020, Hamilton found the voice to speak out on the horrors and injustices of racism, systemic and otherwise. It has not been easy going. He has been central in F1’s decision to promote a pro-diversity agenda this year, but the messaging has left something to be desired. The fact seven F1 drivers have chosen not to take the knee alongside Hamilton at the regular pre-race demonstrations, for example, has contrasted awkwardly with the more united message coming from athletes in sports such as football and basketball. But Hamilton’s determination to speak out has not been affected, and he is not shy of pushing the message to a point where some feel uncomfortable, or feathers are ruffled, such as his decision to wear a T-shirt highlighting another case of police brutality, the killing of Breonna Taylor, on the podium at the Tuscan Grand Prix in September. At the same time, he has won plaudits around the world for his stance on such important issues. Accompanying his naming as one of Time magazine’s 100 most influential people of 2020 was a tribute from Nascar driver Bubba Wallace, the only black competitor in a form of motorsport with perhaps even more of a diversity problem than F1. Wallace wrote that Hamilton’s “activism has moved the world”, adding: “Lewis’s  mental preparation, his aura, his ability to capitalise on every opportunity to use his platform to drive out racism are more than just a model for race-car drivers and other athletes - he’s an inspiration for everyone."" Wolff says: “He’s almost philosophical about certain things. He spends a lot of time thinking. He is someone who hasn’t built his whole life on one particular pillar. It all circles around his driving. He is the F1 world champion. But now he is the F1 world champion and he’s a fighter for diversity, a fighter against racism. These are topics that go far beyond the racing driver. “The topic of racism was always there and we discussed it. Every single year we discussed how we could increase the diversity within the team and he flagged that to me also - look at how many black people are in the team, it’s a super-minority and it is something none of us are really proud of. “Starting with Colin Kaepernick and then the terrible killing of George Floyd, Black Lives Matter and the global movement to fight against racism, for somebody like Lewis Hamilton, with the visibility and recognition he gets from outside, he felt it was important to use his voice. Hamilton’s unwillingness to simply be an F1 driver rubs some people up the wrong way, and he receives criticism from various quarters for a number of different reasons - he’s too outspoken, he’s contrived, he’s too opinionated, too much of a poseur; whatever. But those who have been close to him along the way paint a very different picture. “We spent a lot of time together, travelling,” De la Rosa says. “I remember being in Malaysia testing after the race in 2007. We were having dinner and suddenly a British married couple was sitting next to us and they recognised Lewis. “Back then, he was not really well known. They wanted to take a picture and he said: ‘Do you know me, or do you know Pedro?’ And they said, ‘No, no, we know you. We don’t know Pedro.’ “He was a bit surprised. He was so modest. He invited them to our table. We were having a coffee together and I am pretty sure for that married couple it was the best present for their honeymoon, you know? “That was Lewis when he came into F1. He was truly refreshing. He was really nice. I’m not in contact with him on a regular basis now because I am not attending the races. But when I see him, I feel that it is the same Lewis, and he is the sweet boy I met when I was at McLaren and he was a kid. “From the guy who was having dinner in Malaysia, he has changed. He would not do that now. But he has had to change. And that is what people have to understand. Hamilton’s father says he still can’t quite believe what the boy from the council house in Stevenage has become. “I sit in admiration and awe of Lewis for everything he has done,” Anthony Hamilton says. “It’s a fantastic thing. I’m thinking, ‘Wow. You’re not just a race driver. You’ve become a statesman, a spokesman, a champion of causes for other people.’ “You shouldn’t be frightened to speak your mind. And what you see with Lewis is a young man, a son, who has a heart, who has feelings, who cares for other people. “When I see people criticise him for whatever lifestyle he may have led, well, they don’t really know him. What they see is his public persona. They see that he has money, gold chains and other bits and pieces, but that’s nothing. “What you see on the outside is not what people are; it’s what’s on the inside. And what’s on the inside is a young man who had a dream when he was eight years of age, worked hard, worked diligently, became the best in his field, honestly; is very kind, a very good son, a very good brother. And is enjoying life.” Hamilton is 36 in January. His contract with Mercedes runs out at the end of this year, but while he said after the Emilia Romagna Grand Prix at the beginning of this month that there was “no guarantee” he will stay in F1, on the same day he also said that he wanted to “continue to make history together” with Mercedes. So a new contract seems inevitable, and he will start next season as hot favourite to win an eighth world title and move even further clear in the record books. “He is most aware he is a certain age where you can see the effects on performance,” Wolff says. “But the way he is living his life, the way he looks after himself, the veganism, the training that is constantly adapting to his age, the people he surrounds himself with, all this makes it possible for him to stretch his ability for top performance beyond an age where you would normally think about ending your career. I think he has many more years in him to perform at the top level.” Allison adds: “I hope his future is with us and glorious for a little while longer because it works for us and I know he enjoys being part of this. “But he’s a person who is interesting and interested in lots of different things, and is sufficiently driven that I imagine he will pop up somewhere else doing something interesting. “When he stops doing this - racing, that is - I very much doubt it will be the last the world hears of him.” Author: Andrew Benson Photo editor and producer: Philip Dawkes Editor: Patrick Jennings Sub-editor: Jamie Strickland Photos: Getty Images, Rex Features, PA Images",Positive,0.9999901

Andrew BensonBBC Sportâs chief F1 writer Lewis Hamiltonclinched a seventh World Championshipand became the most successful racing driver ever with a masterful victory in the Turkish Grand Prix on Sunday. The Mercedes driver equalled Michael Schumacher's achievement in terms of titles, after already surpassing the German's number of race wins last month. Victory at a treacherously wet and slippery Istanbul Park track in a topsy-turvy race was the 94th of the 35-year-old Briton's career. As he received the congratulations of his team, Hamilton was almost overcome with emotion in the car after the race, saying: ""To all the kids out there, dream the impossible."" Once out of the car, he added: ""Seven is just unimaginable but when you work with such a great group of people and you really trust each other, there is just no end to what can do together. ""I feel like I'm only just getting started, it's really weird."" Hamilton, who does not yet have a contract for next year, added that he would ""love to stay"" in F1 and wanted to continue to campaign for change when it comes to human rights, diversity and environmentalism.

Lewis Hamilton became the most successful British driver of all-time in 2017 when he sealed a fourth world title. He had seen team-mate Nico Rosberg win the driver's championship a year earlier before the German's surprise retirement. Sebastian Vettel was Hamilton's closest challenger and the title was sealed at the Mexico Grand Prix - a race in which the pair collided. Read our report from 2017 Ferrari's Charles Leclerc, who finished fourth after he was passed by team-mate Sebastian Vettel on the last lap, speaking to Sky Sports:""I'm so angry with myself. I'm so disappointed. ""I was very happy with where we were with 10 laps to go, we were fighting at the end. On the one hand, I cannot afford to do a mistake when fighting for a position and fighting for second place - and today, I'm not on the podium because of these mistakes. ""But congratulations to Seb. It's been a very difficult season and I'm happy that he can show on track what he can do."" ""On Lewis Hamilton's title win:""Congratulations to Lewis, it was more a matter of when and not if.

"This video can not be played ''We fled from death and murder'' The 12-day conflict between Ethiopia's government and forces in the country's Tigray region has escalated. The Tigrayan forces fired rockets across the border into neighbouring Eritrea, after claiming Ethiopian soldiers were using an Eritrean airport to attack Tigray. Ethiopia's prime minister appeared to deny the accusationsin a tweet,external. But analysts say the latest attacks mark a major uptick in a conflict which has displaced thousands of civilians. How Ethiopia's conflict could destabilise its neighbours Marooned by conflict: 'My little brother needs medicine' Ethiopia has been through big changes since Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed came to power in 2018. He was awarded the Nobel peace prize last year after reaching out to make peace with neighbouring Eritrea, with whom Ethiopia had fought a bloody war two decades ago. But the widespread reforms he pushed through sidelined the Tigrayans of the Tigray People's Liberation Front party (TPLF) who had long dominated the political scene - and in recent weeks, tensions between the party and the federal government seriously escalated. Animosity between the government in Tigray and Eritrea goes back a long way, according to the BBC's Africa regional editor Will Ross, who says much of it stems from that border war of 20 years ago which left tens of thousands of soldiers dead. On Sunday, the Ethiopian Human Rights Commission said gunmen had killed at least 34 people on a passenger bus on Saturday night in the western region of Benishangul-Gumuz. The region has seen other acts of violence recently and there has so far been no known link with the Tigray region. On Saturday night, residents of Asmara - Eritrea's capital - reported hearing loud explosions, amid reports of rockets landing near the city's airport. No casualties have been reported yet. Tigrayan leader Debretsion Gebremichael has suggested that his forces have been fighting 16 divisions of the Eritrean army on several fronts for the past few days. The Tigrayans have also accused Eritrean forces of crossing into Ethiopia to back federal forces there. On Sunday,in a tweet,external, Mr Abiy appeared to deny that Ethiopian national forces were working with Eritreans, saying that Ethiopia was ""more than capable of attaining the objectives of the operation by itself"". But while Eritrea and Ethiopia have denied co-operating in the conflict, our regional editor says reports of fighting along the border, and of Ethiopian soldiers being treated in Eritrean hospitals, suggest the opposite is true. By Will Ross, BBC Africa regional editor With missiles being fired into Eritrea this conflict has now become far more serious and is likely to be harder to stop. The repercussions could now cause instability in the whole region. But many people familiar with recent political developments had predicted trouble was brewing when Ethiopia's Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed  became a strong ally of Eritrea's authoritarian leader, Isaias Afwerki. Now the two men have a common enemy - the Tigrayan politicians of the TPLF who dominated Ethiopia's political scene for years, including the time when Ethiopia and Eritrea fought a border war that left tens of thousands dead. International calls for dialogue have so far been ignored and thousands of civilian refugees continue to flee the fighting into Sudan. Hundreds have died in Ethiopia since the fighting began, with reports of a civilian massacre emerging this week. Human rights groupAmnesty International said it had confirmed that ""scores, and likely hundreds, of people were stabbed or hacked to death"" in the town of Mai-Kadra (May Cadera),externalon Monday. Why there are fears of civil war in Ethiopia Fake news being shared over Ethiopia conflict Read more about life in Tigray Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed has accused forces loyal to Tigray's leaders of carrying out the mass killings, while the TPLF has denied involvement. Ethiopia's human rights commission said it would send a team to investigate. The TPLF dominated Ethiopia's military and political life for decades before Mr Abiy took office in 2018 and pushed through major reforms. Last year, Mr Abiy dissolved the ruling coalition, made up of several ethnically based regional parties, and merged them into a single, national party, which the TPLF refused to join. This video can not be played Four things that explain the crisis in the Tigray region of Ethiopia The feud escalated in September, when Tigray held a regional election, defying a nationwide ban on all polls imposed because of the coronavirus pandemic. Mr Abiy responded by calling the vote illegal. Tigray's administration sees Mr Abiy's reforms as an attempt to hand his central government more power and weaken regional states. It also resents what it calls the prime minister's ""unprincipled"" friendship with Eritrean President Isaias Afwerki. Mr Abiy won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2019 for his efforts to bring peace with Eritrea. The prime minister believes TPLF officials are undermining his authority. Mr Abiy ordered the military operation against the TPLF after he said its fighters had crossed ""the last red line"".  He accused them of attacking a military camp hosting federal troops on 4 November, calling the action ""treasonous"". The TPLF has denied attacking the camp.

"Emergency laws to ""stamp out dangerous"" anti-vaccine content online should be introduced, Labour has said. The party is calling for financial and criminal penalties for social media firms that do not remove false scare stories about vaccines. It follows news of progress on the first effective coronavirus vaccine. The government said it took the issue ""extremely seriously"" with ""a major commitment"" from Facebook, Twitter and Google to tackle anti-vaccine content. Many social media platforms label false content as misleading or disputed - and all remove posts that contravene terms of service. But Labour said a commitment by platforms to remove content flagged by the government was not enough. Shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth said such content was ""exploiting people's fears, their mistrust of institutions and governments and spreading poison and harm"". He told BBC Breakfast his party wanted to work with the government on a cross-party basis to build trust and help promote take-up of the vaccine. Microchips, 'altered DNA' and other false vaccine rumours He said people would have legitimate questions about what the vaccine means for them, levels of immunity and whether the vaccine was appropriate for those with chronic health conditions. ""There's nothing wrong with asking those questions and strong public health messaging from the government, reinforced by us, will allay those fears,"" he said. Baseless conspiracy theories about a coronavirus vaccine have been spreading on social media for months - and the latest vaccine news rekindled these pre-existing narratives online. These includes false claims that the vaccine is a means of inserting microchips into the population, altering our DNA, or are even a weapon of genocide. Within hours of news breaking about the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine, comments and memes suggesting it will deliberately harm us were popping up in local Facebook groups, parent chats and on Instagram. This kind of disinformation is worlds away from legitimate concerns that a vaccine is safe and properly tested. Despite commitments to tackle falsehoods from social media sites and the government, a constant bubbling of conspiracies online looks to have already eroded trust for some in an effective vaccine. The anti-vax movement, which pre-dates the pandemic, is not the only thing responsible for the spread of this disinformation online. Pseudoscience figures with large online followings - who have spread other false claims such as linking coronavirus to 5G or suggesting the pandemic is a hoax - have also turned their attention to vaccines. There is no truth to the false and harmful claims they make - but that hasn't stopped them spilling into the average social media feed for weeks and impacting those who come across them. Meanwhile, a member of the government's scientific advisory group, Sage, has criticised ministers' strategy of ""flip-flopping"" between encouraging people to socialise and spend money - and tough lockdown restrictions in England. Professor John Edmunds said: ""We need to take a long-term view and be sensible and realise that we're going to have to have restrictions in place for some time. ""Yes, we can lift them when it's safe to do so, which will be primarily when large numbers of people have been vaccinated. ""But flip-flopping between encouraging people to mix socially, which is what you're doing by encouraging people to go to restaurants and bars, versus then immediately closing them again, isn't a very sensible way to run the epidemic."" How close are we to a coronavirus vaccine? Who will get the vaccine first and when can you have it? The national lockdown in England is currently due to end on 2 December, with a return to the tiered system of local restrictions. Prof Edmunds also criticised that system of lower to higher restrictions, saying it was not ""very well thought through"". Scotland has moved to a five-tier system of coronavirus restrictions. Wales has now ended a ""circuit breaker"" while Northern Ireland has extended its own temporary lockdown. A further 26,860 UK coronavirus cases were recorded on Saturday and 462 more deaths within 28 days of a positive test were reported. Suspicion of vaccines has been around almost as long as modern vaccines themselves. But in recent years, the anti-vaccination - or ""anti-vax""- movement has gained traction online. Social media has been blamed for allowing unfounded claims about vaccines to spread more easily. In 2019, the UKlost its measles-free statusdesignated by the World Health Organization - and there has been a marked decline in vaccination rates for all 13 diseases covered in jabs for children. Since the pandemic, anti-vaccination campaigners have moved their focus to the coronavirus. This video can not be played Health Correspondent Laura Foster explains what the latest Covid-19 vaccine news means In the letter to Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden, Labour said there were dedicated anti-vaccination groups online with hundreds of thousands of followers who were ""churning out disinformation"" on the issue. Last week,the government announced,externalthat social media companies had agreed a package of measures - including that no company should be profiting from Covid vaccine fake news. But Labour warned that the measures do not go far enough and has questioned why anti-vax groups are not being closed down. ""The announced collaboration with social media companies last week was welcome but feels grossly inadequate with a promise by them to remove only the content which is flagged by government and which generates profit,"" Labour said. Labour called for emergency legislation that would see financial and criminal penalties for a continued failure to act, and said they would vote for it. This video can not be played Research shows a number of young people may choose not to have a Covid-19 vaccination On Monday, news of a potential vaccine made headlines after preliminary results from Pfizer and BioNTech showed their vaccine could prevent more than 90% of people from catching Covid. The vaccine is one of 11 vaccines that are currently in the final stages of testing. Pfizer and BioNTech companies now plan to apply for emergency approval to use the vaccine by the end of November and a limited number of people may be given the vaccine this year. The UK has bought enough doses for 20 million people. But it will not be released for use in the UK until it passes final safety tests and gets the go-ahead from the MHRA - the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency. Thehead of the MHRA said this weekit will not lower its safety standards despite the need to get a Covid vaccine quickly. This video can not be played Boris Johnson: âAnti-vax is total nonsense, you should definitely get a vaccine."" Earlier this year, Prime Minister Boris Johnson called people who oppose vaccinations ""nuts"". And this week, he said he had ""no inhibitions"" about getting one, adding: ""Anti-vax is total nonsense, you should definitely get a vaccine."" A government spokesperson said: ""Letting vaccine disinformation spread unchecked could cost British lives. ""We take this issue extremely seriously andhave secured a major commitment,externalfrom Facebook, Twitter and Google to tackle it by not profiting from such material, and by responding to flagged content more swiftly. ""We continue to work closely with social media firms to promote authoritative sources of information so people have access to vaccine facts not fiction.""

"This video can not be played ''We fled from death and murder'' The 12-day conflict between Ethiopia's government and forces in the country's Tigray region has escalated. The Tigrayan forces fired rockets across the border into neighbouring Eritrea, after claiming Ethiopian soldiers were using an Eritrean airport to attack Tigray. Ethiopia's prime minister appeared to deny the accusationsin a tweet,external. But analysts say the latest attacks mark a major uptick in a conflict which has displaced thousands of civilians. How Ethiopia's conflict could destabilise its neighbours Marooned by conflict: 'My little brother needs medicine' Ethiopia has been through big changes since Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed came to power in 2018. He was awarded the Nobel peace prize last year after reaching out to make peace with neighbouring Eritrea, with whom Ethiopia had fought a bloody war two decades ago. But the widespread reforms he pushed through sidelined the Tigrayans of the Tigray People's Liberation Front party (TPLF) who had long dominated the political scene - and in recent weeks, tensions between the party and the federal government seriously escalated. Animosity between the government in Tigray and Eritrea goes back a long way, according to the BBC's Africa regional editor Will Ross, who says much of it stems from that border war of 20 years ago which left tens of thousands of soldiers dead. On Sunday, the Ethiopian Human Rights Commission said gunmen had killed at least 34 people on a passenger bus on Saturday night in the western region of Benishangul-Gumuz. The region has seen other acts of violence recently and there has so far been no known link with the Tigray region. On Saturday night, residents of Asmara - Eritrea's capital - reported hearing loud explosions, amid reports of rockets landing near the city's airport. No casualties have been reported yet. Tigrayan leader Debretsion Gebremichael has suggested that his forces have been fighting 16 divisions of the Eritrean army on several fronts for the past few days. The Tigrayans have also accused Eritrean forces of crossing into Ethiopia to back federal forces there. On Sunday,in a tweet,external, Mr Abiy appeared to deny that Ethiopian national forces were working with Eritreans, saying that Ethiopia was ""more than capable of attaining the objectives of the operation by itself"". But while Eritrea and Ethiopia have denied co-operating in the conflict, our regional editor says reports of fighting along the border, and of Ethiopian soldiers being treated in Eritrean hospitals, suggest the opposite is true. By Will Ross, BBC Africa regional editor With missiles being fired into Eritrea this conflict has now become far more serious and is likely to be harder to stop. The repercussions could now cause instability in the whole region. But many people familiar with recent political developments had predicted trouble was brewing when Ethiopia's Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed  became a strong ally of Eritrea's authoritarian leader, Isaias Afwerki. Now the two men have a common enemy - the Tigrayan politicians of the TPLF who dominated Ethiopia's political scene for years, including the time when Ethiopia and Eritrea fought a border war that left tens of thousands dead. International calls for dialogue have so far been ignored and thousands of civilian refugees continue to flee the fighting into Sudan. Hundreds have died in Ethiopia since the fighting began, with reports of a civilian massacre emerging this week.

"Emergency laws to ""stamp out dangerous"" anti-vaccine content online should be introduced, Labour has said. The party is calling for financial and criminal penalties for social media firms that do not remove false scare stories about vaccines. It follows news of progress on the first effective coronavirus vaccine. The government said it took the issue ""extremely seriously"" with ""a major commitment"" from Facebook, Twitter and Google to tackle anti-vaccine content. Many social media platforms label false content as misleading or disputed - and all remove posts that contravene terms of service. But Labour said a commitment by platforms to remove content flagged by the government was not enough. Shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth said such content was ""exploiting people's fears, their mistrust of institutions and governments and spreading poison and harm"". He told BBC Breakfast his party wanted to work with the government on a cross-party basis to build trust and help promote take-up of the vaccine. Microchips, 'altered DNA' and other false vaccine rumours He said people would have legitimate questions about what the vaccine means for them, levels of immunity and whether the vaccine was appropriate for those with chronic health conditions. ""There's nothing wrong with asking those questions and strong public health messaging from the government, reinforced by us, will allay those fears,"" he said. Baseless conspiracy theories about a coronavirus vaccine have been spreading on social media for months - and the latest vaccine news rekindled these pre-existing narratives online. These includes false claims that the vaccine is a means of inserting microchips into the population, altering our DNA, or are even a weapon of genocide. Within hours of news breaking about the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine, comments and memes suggesting it will deliberately harm us were popping up in local Facebook groups, parent chats and on Instagram. This kind of disinformation is worlds away from legitimate concerns that a vaccine is safe and properly tested. Despite commitments to tackle falsehoods from social media sites and the government, a constant bubbling of conspiracies online looks to have already eroded trust for some in an effective vaccine. The anti-vax movement, which pre-dates the pandemic, is not the only thing responsible for the spread of this disinformation online. Pseudoscience figures with large online followings - who have spread other false claims such as linking coronavirus to 5G or suggesting the pandemic is a hoax - have also turned their attention to vaccines. There is no truth to the false and harmful claims they make - but that hasn't stopped them spilling into the average social media feed for weeks and impacting those who come across them. Meanwhile, a member of the government's scientific advisory group, Sage, has criticised ministers' strategy of ""flip-flopping"" between encouraging people to socialise and spend money - and tough lockdown restrictions in England. Professor John Edmunds said: ""We need to take a long-term view and be sensible and realise that we're going to have to have restrictions in place for some time. ""Yes, we can lift them when it's safe to do so, which will be primarily when large numbers of people have been vaccinated. ""But flip-flopping between encouraging people to mix socially, which is what you're doing by encouraging people to go to restaurants and bars, versus then immediately closing them again, isn't a very sensible way to run the epidemic."" How close are we to a coronavirus vaccine? Who will get the vaccine first and when can you have it? The national lockdown in England is currently due to end on 2 December, with a return to the tiered system of local restrictions. Prof Edmunds also criticised that system of lower to higher restrictions, saying it was not ""very well thought through"". Scotland has moved to a five-tier system of coronavirus restrictions. Wales has now ended a ""circuit breaker"" while Northern Ireland has extended its own temporary lockdown. A further 26,860 UK coronavirus cases were recorded on Saturday and 462 more deaths within 28 days of a positive test were reported. Suspicion of vaccines has been around almost as long as modern vaccines themselves. But in recent years, the anti-vaccination - or ""anti-vax""- movement has gained traction online. Social media has been blamed for allowing unfounded claims about vaccines to spread more easily. In 2019, the UKlost its measles-free statusdesignated by the World Health Organization - and there has been a marked decline in vaccination rates for all 13 diseases covered in jabs for children. Since the pandemic, anti-vaccination campaigners have moved their focus to the coronavirus. This video can not be played Health Correspondent Laura Foster explains what the latest Covid-19 vaccine news means In the letter to Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden, Labour said there were dedicated anti-vaccination groups online with hundreds of thousands of followers who were ""churning out disinformation"" on the issue. Last week,the government announced,externalthat social media companies had agreed a package of measures - including that no company should be profiting from Covid vaccine fake news. But Labour warned that the measures do not go far enough and has questioned why anti-vax groups are not being closed down. ""The announced collaboration with social media companies last week was welcome but feels grossly inadequate with a promise by them to remove only the content which is flagged by government and which generates profit,"" Labour said. Labour called for emergency legislation that would see financial and criminal penalties for a continued failure to act, and said they would vote for it. This video can not be played Research shows a number of young people may choose not to have a Covid-19 vaccination On Monday, news of a potential vaccine made headlines after preliminary results from Pfizer and BioNTech showed their vaccine could prevent more than 90% of people from catching Covid. The vaccine is one of 11 vaccines that are currently in the final stages of testing. Pfizer and BioNTech companies now plan to apply for emergency approval to use the vaccine by the end of November and a limited number of people may be given the vaccine this year. The UK has bought enough doses for 20 million people. But it will not be released for use in the UK until it passes final safety tests and gets the go-ahead from the MHRA - the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency.

A government spokesperson said: ""Letting vaccine disinformation spread unchecked could cost British lives.

"The family of Oscar Jealous said they have been ""overwhelmed"" by the response to their appeal for cards Hundreds of people have sent birthday cards to a nine-year-old boy after an appeal by his family. Oscar Jealous, from Kingstanding in Birmingham, was diagnosed with life-limiting Batten disease in February. His family put out a plea for cards about 10 days ago and said they had been ""overwhelmed"" by the response. His father, Alex, said they wanted to do something to ""make Oscar feel special"" and give him a birthday to remember on Sunday. Thousands of pounds have already been raised to help Oscar's family pay for his specialist care andalso to help him fulfil a ""bucket list of dream days"". Oscar's condition,externalmeans he is losing his sight, will gradually lose speech and mobility and is developing dementia. Oscar Jealous, who turned nine on Sunday, was diagnosed with Batten disease earlier this year ""The intention when he was diagnosed was to have a big family party in the garden,"" Mr Jealous said. ""The simple fact is, it is more likely that next year will be very different, this is probably going to be the last birthday where he understands what is going on."" Mr Jealous said they had received more than 500 cards, about 20 presents and were expecting a ""mountain"" of balloons to be delivered on Oscar's birthday. ""It is a very overwhelming thing, but at the same time it is nice,"" he said. ""It highlights how supported we are as a family, not just from close friends and family but from the wider community.

"Sir Keir said his name - named after Labour Party founder Keir Hardie - earned him ""plenty of nicknames"" at school Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer has spoken of his regret at not being close to his late father, who he described as a ""difficult"" and ""complicated"" man. He told Lauren Laverne on BBC Radio 4's Desert Island Discs, that he was ""determined that my relationship with my own children will be different"". In the interview, Sir Keir also talked about how his political beliefs had shifted, and his aim to unite Labour. And he spoke about his love of football, saying he plays every week. Among the songs that Sir Keir chose were the England football anthem Three Lions by The Lightning Seeds, and Jim Reeves' Welcome To My World, which was his mother's favourite song. He also picked a Northern Soul record - Dobie Gray's Out On The Floor - saying it reminded him of his ""early days in London with a group of friends in a really grotty flat above a sauna and massage parlour that kept interesting hours"". Listen: Keir Starmer on Desert Island Discs Who is Sir Keir Starmer? Asked by presenter Lauren Laverne about his parents and upbringing in Oxted, Surrey, Sir Keir, 58, said: ""I don't often talk about my dad."" ""He was a difficult man, a complicated man, he kept himself to himself, he didn't particularly like to socialise, so wouldn't really go out very much. But he was incredibly hard-working."" Sir Keir said his father worked as a toolmaker in a factory and would work 14-hour days, coming home for an hour at 17:00 ""for his tea"" before returning to work again in the evening. ""But he had this utter devotion and commitment to my mum,"" said Sir Keir. ""My mum was very, very ill all of her life and my dad knew exactly the symptoms of everything that might possibly go wrong with my mum, he knew exactly what drugs or combination of drugs or injection would be needed. ""He stopped drinking completely just in case he ever needed to get to the hospital with her. On the many occasions she was in hospital he would stay with her the whole time, he wouldn't leave the hospital, he would sleep on any chair or whatever was available."" But Sir Keir adds: ""I wouldn't say we were close. I understood who he was and what he was but we weren't close and I regret that."" Ten years ago, pre-politics, Sir Keir was the Director of Public Prosecutions Sir Keir grew emotional when speaking about his mother - who had lived with the autoimmune condition Still's Disease since she was 11 - as he recalled when his father had phoned from the hospital to say: ""I don't think your mum's going to make it."" He said his mother died just a few weeks before he was elected into Parliament as an MP in 2015, and his father died a couple of years ago. Sir Keir's parents were ""Labour through and through"" but he said they did not have discussions about politics around the kitchen table. Sir Keir said his politics had changed over the years but he still considered himself to be a socialist, adding: ""Like most people, I started off as the radical who knew everything. I'm now much more open to ideas."" The former human rights lawyer and Director of Public Prosecutions also spoke about his aim for a ""united Labour Party"" and also addressed therecent decision to suspend former leader Jeremy Corbynfrom the party. ""I didn't want that day to end in the way it did,"" he said, of the day the report into anti-Semitism in Labour was published. ""I had no intention of purging anyone. I have no intention of purging anyone. I want the Labour Party to be a broad church."" He added being named Keir - after Keir Hardie, founder of the Labour Party - earned him ""plenty of nicknames at school"". ""I have to say at school, I was saying 'why on earth did you have to call me Keir? Why couldn't you have called me Pete or Dave or something like everybody else',"" he said.

"This video can not be played BioNTech's Ugur Sahin: ""I'm confident that...we could have a normal winter next year"" The impact of a new Covid vaccine will kick in significantly over summer and life should be back to normal by next winter, one of its creators has said. Prof Ugur Sahin, BioNTech co-founder, also raised hopes the jab could halve transmission of the virus, resulting in a ""dramatic reduction in cases"". Last week, BioNTech and co-developers Pfizer said preliminary analysis showed their vaccine could prevent more than 90% of people from getting Covid-19. About 43,000 people took part in tests. In an interview on BBC One's Andrew Marr Show, Prof Sahin said he expected further analysis to show the vaccine would reduce transmission between people as well as stop symptoms developing in someone who has had the vaccine. ""I'm very confident that transmission between people will be reduced by such a highly effective vaccine - maybe not 90% but maybe 50% - but we should not forget that even that could result in a dramatic reduction of the pandemic spread,"" he said. How close are we to a vaccine? Who will get the vaccine first and when can you have it? Call to stop anti-vaccination 'fake news' The UK is expected to get 10 million doses of the BioNTech/Pfizer vaccine by the end of the year, with a further 30 million doses already ordered. The jab, which was trialled in six countries, is given in two doses, three weeks apart. Older residents and staff in care homes are likely to be prioritised, followed by health workers and the over-80s. People would then be ranked by age. The UK government announced another 24,962confirmed Covid cases,externalon Sunday, as well as a further 168 deaths within 28 days of a positive test. Afterthe announcement of the world's first effective vaccinecame on Monday, Sir John Bell, regius professor of medicine at Oxford University, suggested life could be back to normal by spring. ""I am probably the first guy to say that, but I will say that with some confidence,"" he said. However, Prof Sahin said it would take longer. If everything continued to go well, he said, the vaccine would begin to be delivered at the ""end of this year, beginning of next year"". He said the goal was to deliver more than 300 million doses worldwide by next April, which ""could allow us to only start to make an impact"". He said the bigger impact would happen later, adding: ""Summer will help us because the infection rate will go down in the summer and what is absolutely essential is that we get a high vaccination rate until or before autumn/winter next year."" Prof Sahin said it was essential that all immunisation programmes were completed before next autumn. The vaccine has given a boost of confidence that an end to the pandemic is close, with the leading scientist behind it hopeful life could return to normal by next winter. But there are some big uncertainties. The vaccine needs approval from regulators - and they will only grant that if they're happy the jab is safe and works well. Early results look very good, but we await the full ones in the coming weeks. There is also no data yet to show how well the jab works in those who need it the most - the elderly. Nor do we know if it stops people spreading the disease, as well as getting sick. And it's not clear how long immunity might last. People might need yearly boosters. If the vaccine is rolled out, it will take time to immunise and protect enough people. Other Covid-19 vaccines may come along that work just as well or even better than this new vaccine. But it is possible that by the summer, mass immunisation will be well under way and we could start to reap the benefits. Asked if the vaccine was as effective in older people as it is in younger people, he said he expected to have a better idea in the next three weeks. He said it was not yet known how long immunity would last after the second dose of the vaccine is given. However, he said, a booster immunisation ""should not be too complicated"" if it was found immunity was reduced significantly after one year. Prof Sahin also said the ""key side effects"" of the vaccine seen so far were a mild to moderate pain in the injection site for a few days, while some participants had a mild to moderate fever over a similar period. ""We did not see any other serious side effects which would result in pausing or halting of the study,"" he added. His vaccine is one of 11 currently in the final stages of testing. It will not be released for use in the UK until it passes final safety tests and gets the go-ahead from the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA). Theagency's head has saidit would not lower its safety standards despite the need to get a vaccine quickly. If it was approved, the NHS would be ready to roll out the vaccine from December,Health Secretary Matt Hancock said. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has urged people not to slacken their resolve in the meantime, sayingthe vaccine's development ""cleared one significant hurdlebut there are several more to go"". Meanwhile, concerns have been raised that mutated forms of the virus might hamper the effectiveness of future vaccines. It comes after12 people were found with a mink-related strain of the virusfollowing an outbreak in Denmark. Virology professor Wendy Barclay, a scientific adviser for the government, said there was a ""worry"" that the vaccines currently under development ""won't work quite so well as the virus continues to evolve"". This did not mean vaccines would not work at all, she added, but adaptable and fast-responding jabs could be the best option. SCHOOLS:What will happen if children catch coronavirus? TESTING:How do I get a virus test? LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? SUPPORT BUBBLES:What are they and who can be in yours? Earlier,Labour accused the government of not doing enough to ""stamp out dangerous"" anti-vaccine content onlineand called for emergency laws brought in. It wants financial and criminal penalties for social media firms that do not remove false scare stories about vaccines. Shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth said such content was ""exploiting people's fears, their mistrust of institutions and governments and spreading poison and harm"". His party wanted to work with the government on a cross-party basis to build trust and help promote take-up of the vaccine, he said. The government said it took the issue ""extremely seriously"" with ""a major commitment"" from Facebook, Twitter and Google to tackle anti-vaccine content. Many social media platforms label false content as misleading or disputed - and all remove posts that contravene terms of service.

"We've looked into some of the most widely shared false vaccine claims - everything from alleged plots to put microchips into people to the supposed re-engineering of our genetic code. The fear that a vaccine will somehow change your DNA is one we've seen aired regularly on social media. The BBC asked three independent scientists about this. They said that the coronavirus vaccine would not alter human DNA. Some of the newly created vaccines, includingthe one now approved in the UK developed by Pfizer/BioNTech,use a fragment of the virus's genetic material - or messenger RNA. ""Injecting RNA into a person doesn't do anything to the DNA of a human cell,"" says Prof Jeffrey Almond of Oxford University. It works by giving the body instructions to produce a protein which is present on the surface of the coronavirus. The immune system then learns to recognise and produce antibodies against the protein. Claims that Bill Gates plans to use a vaccine to ""manipulate"" or ""alter"" human DNA have been widely shared This isn't the first time we've looked into claims that a coronavirus vaccine will supposedly alter DNA.We investigated a popular video spreading the theoryback in May. Posts have noted that messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccine technology ""has never been tested or approved before"". It is true that no mRNA vaccine has been approved before now, but multiple studies of mRNA vaccines in humans have taken place over the last few years. And, since the pandemic started, the vaccine has been tested on tens of thousands of people around the world and has gone through a rigorous safety approval process. Like all new vaccines, it has to undergo rigorous safety checks before it can be recommended for widespread use. What are the safety checks for vaccines? In Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical trials, vaccines are tested in small numbers of volunteers to check they are safe and to determine the right dose. In Phase 3 trials they are tested in thousands of people to see how effective they are. The group who received the vaccine and a control group who have received a placebo are closely monitored for any adverse reactions - side-effects. Safety monitoring continues after a vaccine has been approved for use. Next, a conspiracy theory that has spanned the globe. It claims that the coronavirus pandemic is a cover for a plan to implant trackable microchips and that the Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates is behind it. There is no vaccine ""microchip"" and there is no evidence to support claims that Bill Gates is planning for this in the future. The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation told the BBC the claim was ""false"". One TikTok user created a video about being ""microchipped"" and called a vaccine the ""mark of the beast"" Rumours took hold in March when Mr Gates said in an interview that eventually ""we will have some digital certificates"" which would be used to show who'd recovered, been tested and ultimately who received a vaccine. He made no mention of microchips. This led to one widely shared article headlined: ""Bill Gates will use microchip implants to fight coronavirus."" The article makes reference to a study, funded by The Gates Foundation, into a technology that could store someone's vaccine records in a special ink administered at the same time as an injection. However, the technology is not a microchip and is more like an invisible tattoo. It has not been rolled out yet, would not allow people to be tracked and personal information would not be entered into a database, says Ana Jaklenec, a scientist involved in the study. The billionaire founder of Microsoft has been the subject of many false rumours during the pandemic. He's been targeted because of his philanthropic work in public health and vaccine development. Despite the lack of evidence, in May aYouGov poll of 1,640 people,externalsuggested 28% of Americans believed Mr Gates wanted to use vaccines to implant microchips in people - with the figure rising to 44% among Republicans. Who will get the vaccine first and when can you have it? How will I get the coronavirus vaccine? Covid vaccine update: When will one be ready? We've seen claims that vaccines contain the lung tissue of an aborted fetus. This is false. ""There are no fetal cells used in any vaccine production process,"" says Dr Michael Head, of the University of Southampton. One particular video that was posted on one of the biggest anti-vaccine Facebook pages refers to a study which the narrator claims is evidence of what goes into the vaccine developed by AstraZeneca and Oxford University. But the narrator's interpretation is wrong - the study in question explored how the vaccine reacted when introduced to human cells in a lab. Confusion may have arisen because there is a step in the process of developing a vaccine that uses cells grown in a lab, which are the descendants of embryonic cells that would otherwise have been destroyed. Thetechnique was developed in the 1960s, and no fetuses were aborted for the purposes of this research. Many vaccines are made in this way, explains Dr David Matthews, from Bristol University, adding that any traces of the cells are comprehensively removed from the vaccine ""to exceptionally high standards"". The developers of the vaccine at Oxford University say they worked with cloned cells, but these cells ""are not themselves the cells of aborted babies"". The cells work like a factory to manufacture a greatly weakened form of the virus that has been adapted to function as a vaccine. But even though the weakened virus is created using these cloned cells, this cellular material is removed when the virus is purified and not used in the vaccine. We've seen arguments against a Covid-19 vaccine shared across social media asking why we need one at all if the chances of dying from the virus are so slim. A meme shared by people who oppose vaccination put the recovery rate from the disease at 99.97% and suggested getting Covid-19 is a safer option than taking a vaccine. BBC Bitesize: Finding the facts in a pandemic A meme using images of rapper Drake has been used to promote false vaccine claims To begin with, the figure referred to in the meme as the ""recovery rate"" - implying these are people who caught the virus and survived - is not correct. About 99.0% of people who catch Covid survive it, says Jason Oke, senior statistician at the University of Oxford. So around 100 in 10,000 will die - far higher than three in 10,000, as suggested in the meme. However, Mr Oke adds that ""in all cases the risks very much depend on age and do not take into account short and long-term morbidity from Covid-19"". It's not just about survival. For every person who dies, there are others who live through it but undergo intensive medical care, and those who sufferlong-lasting health effects. This can contribute to a health service overburdened with Covid patients, competing with a hospital's limited resources to treat patients with other illnesses and injuries. Concentrating on the overall death rate, or breaking down the taking of a vaccine to an individual act, misses the point of vaccinations, says Prof Liam Smeeth of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. It should be seen as an effort by society to protect others, he says. ""In the UK, the worst part of the pandemic, the reason for lockdown, is because the health service would be overwhelmed. Vulnerable groups like the old and sick in care homes have a much higher chance of getting severely ill if they catch the virus"".

"Elon Musk said at the start of the pandemic that the ""panic"" could ""cause more harm than the virus"" Tech entrepreneur Elon Musk says he ""most likely"" has a ""moderate case"" of Covid-19 but has been ""getting wildly different results from different labs"". The boss of Tesla and SpaceX, who is 49, tweeted his symptoms were those of a ""minor cold"". On Friday he said he had been tested four times, with two positive and two negative results. Mr Musk appeared to play down concerns about the pandemic when it first hit. Covid-19 has now infected nearly 10.9 million people in the US. More than 245,000 people have died there, and more than 67,000 people are currently in hospital. Some 35 US states now require face coverings to be worn in public and many are urging residents to stick to social distancing amid fears their health care systems will be swamped with infected patients.

"The Lake District is one of England's 10 existing national parks A further Â£40m is to be ploughed into green spaces in England as part of a plan to restore species and combat climate change. The government says the cash will fund thousands of jobs in conservation. The prime minister also promised new national parks and greater protections for Englandâs iconic landscapes. Environmentalists welcomed the investment but said it was a fraction of what is needed to restore Britainâs depleted wildlife. PM promises to protect 30% of UK's land by 2030 What's in Boris Johnson's climate in tray? Can coronavirus crisis spur a green recovery? Where are England's 10 national parks? Boris Johnson said the scheme was part of his 10-point plan for combating climate change, which Downing Street said would be unveiled this week. The plan has been widely leaked and it is thought to include a commitment to: energy efficiency and heat for homes and business offshore wind the power system nuclear â including small modular reactors carbon capture/storage hydrogen innovation funding for net-zero transport green financing natural environment investment The natural environment funding will go to environmental charities creating or restoring important habitats like peatland and wetland; preventing or cleaning up pollution; creating woodland; and helping people connect with nature. Mr Johnson said this will in turn create and retain skilled and unskilled jobs, such as ecologists, project managers, tree planters and teams to carry out nature restoration. The projects could give a home to species that flourished in similar initiatives across the country, including the curlew, nightingale, horseshoe bat, pine marten, red squirrel and wild orchids. Mr Johnson said: âBritainâs iconic landscapes are part of the fabric of our national identity - sustaining our communities, driving local economies and inspiring people across the ages. âThatâs why, with the natural world under threat, itâs more important than ever that we act now to enhance our natural environment and protect our precious wildlife and biodiversity.â There are currently10 national parks in England- including the South Downs, Lake District and Peak District - as well as 34 areas of outstanding national beauty (AONB). The government says the process for designating new national parks and AONB will start next year. And 10 long-term ""landscape recovery"" projects will be initiated between 2022 and 2024 to restore wilder landscapes. Craig Bennett, from the Wildlife Trusts, said:  ""Of course this is welcome, but itâs a tiny amount compared with whatâs needed. âA previous promise of Â£40mwas over-subscribed seven times over,external. âThe government has pledged to protect 30% of the countryside by 2030, but at the moment only 5% is protected for wildlife. We need Â£1bn every year for this enormous task."" Tony Juniper, head of government agency Natural England, said: ""I warmly welcome this as part of the delivery of the National Nature Recovery Network - and Iâm really pleased to have all this coming from the PM.â The government has slashed funding for his organisation and earlier this week he told MPs on the Environmental Audit Committee that its current funding is below the level required to carry out  statutory duties to a good standard. Mr Juniper said taking action to protect species at risk of extinction, ceasing management duties forNational Nature Reserves,externaland engaging only a small number of planning authorities to support landscape and biodiversity activities are some of the areas where Natural England has had to scale back support.

Read it all and enjoy here. Andrew BensonBBC Sportâs chief F1 writer Lewis Hamiltonclinched a seventh World Championshipand became the most successful racing driver ever with a masterful victory in the Turkish Grand Prix on Sunday. The Mercedes driver equalled Michael Schumacher's achievement in terms of titles, after already surpassing the German's number of race wins last month. Victory at a treacherously wet and slippery Istanbul Park track in a topsy-turvy race was the 94th of the 35-year-old Briton's career. As he received the congratulations of his team, Hamilton was almost overcome with emotion in the car after the race, saying: ""To all the kids out there, dream the impossible."" Once out of the car, he added: ""Seven is just unimaginable but when you work with such a great group of people and you really trust each other, there is just no end to what can do together. ""I feel like I'm only just getting started, it's really weird."" Hamilton, who does not yet have a contract for next year, added that he would ""love to stay"" in F1 and wanted to continue to campaign for change when it comes to human rights, diversity and environmentalism.

"Protesters carried the Peruvian flag during Saturday's rally Two people have died in clashes in Peru's capital Lima between police and protesters angry at the impeachment of President MartÃ­n Vizcarra. Several people were injured in the violence that saw police fire tear gas into the crowd of many thousands. Peru has been rocked by mass protests since Congress voted on Monday to impeach Mr Vizcarra over alleged bribery - charges he denies. Speaker of Congress Manuel Merino has taken over as interim president. There are concerns of a growing political crisis as Peru faces a severe economic downturn brought on by the coronavirus pandemic. Coronavirus: What's happening in Peru? Tens of thousands of demonstrators - many of them young - gathered again in Lima and other cities on Saturday for protests that were for the large part peaceful. A number of people were injured The capital echoed with sirens, shouts and chants of protesters demanding the removal of Mr Merino, Reuters reports. Clashes broke out towards the evening after a group of hooded protesters threw fireworks and stones at the police, who responded with tear gas. Two men, one aged 24 and the other 25, were killed. Mr Vizcarra, 57, has enjoyed continued support among many voters for his attempts at reform. He has been embroiled in a bitter battle with Congress, which is dominated by rival parties, since he took office in March 2018. Last year, the president dissolved Congress, arguing that lawmakers were obstructing his anti-corruption agenda. A new Congress was elected in January, but tension remained high between the legislative and the executive, with Mr Vizcarra accusing lawmakers of fostering ""chaos and disorder"". Mr Vizcarra has denied allegations that he accepted bribes worth 2.3m soles ($640,000; Â£487,000) when he was governor of the southern Moquegua region. Monday's move in Congress came after a previous attempt to remove him. An earlier vote held on 18 September fell far short of gaining the necessary votes when only 32 lawmakers cast their ballot in favour of removing Mr Vizcarra. This video can not be played Peru has seen days of protests Mr Vizcarra had previously said he would accept the impeachment vote, not take any legal action, and leave the presidential palace. But on Tuesday, he questioned the ""legality and legitimacy"" of his removal. ""Legality is in question because the Constitutional Court has not yet ruled, and legitimacy is given by the people,"" he told reporters outside his home in Lima. Mr Merino is expected to retain the presidency until July 2021 - when Mr Vizcarra's term was due to end.

"Entertainer Des O'Connor has died at the age of 88, his agent has confirmed. The comedian, singer and TV host died on Saturday following a fall at his home in Buckinghamshire just over a week ago. He was known for hosting his own chat show, as well as Take Your Pick and Countdown - and for his friendship with Morecambe and Wise. In a statement his agent said he was ""well loved by absolutely everybody"" and ""loved life"". His long-time agent and family friend Pat Lake-Smith described him as the ""ultimate entertainer"" and said he had been recovering from the fall before his condition had suddenly deteriorated. She said: ""He was a joy to work with - he was talented, fun, positive, enthusiastic, kind and a total professional. He loved life, and considered enthusiasm almost as important as oxygen."" Obituary: Des O'Connor London-born O'Connor presented his own prime-time TV shows for more than 45 years but also had success as a singer. His friendship with comedy duo Morecambe and Wise saw him mocked for his singing ability in sketches despite a successful career which included four Top 10 hits and more than 30 albums. This video can not be played David Sillito looks back at Des O'Connor's career O'Connor appeared on stages around the world including hundreds of shows at the London Palladium. His fame soared when he was hired to host The Des O'Connor Show, which ran on ITV from 1963 to 1971. In 1977 he began hosting Des O'Connor Tonight, which started on BBC Two before moving to ITV, where it stayed until it ended in 2002. He later hosted the Channel 4 quiz show Countdown alongside Carol Vorderman, with the pair bowing out together in 2008, and was made a CBE for his services to entertainment and broadcasting in that year's birthday honours. This video can not be played Gyles Brandreth: ""I don't think you'll find anybody...who's got a thing to say against Des O'Connor"" O'Connor was married four times, and has described the end of his first three relationships as casualties of his obsession with work. In 2007, he married long-term girlfriend Jodie Brooke Wilson, who was 37 years his junior and gave birth to their son Adam when O'Connor was 72. O'Connor also had four daughters, Karin, TJ, Samantha and Kristina from his previous marriages. Tributes have been paid following his death, with Countdown co-host Vorderman saying he was a born entertainer and it had been a ""complete joy to work with him"". She told BBC News: ""I grew up throughout the Des O'Connor years, when he was on the television all the time, on Des O'Connor Tonight and the Morecambe and Wise shows. O'Connor was made a CBE in the 2008 Birthday Honours ""Up to 20 million people would sit around the television and watch and laugh, and I mean laugh until they cried. ""He was the king; he was one of the very great British television entertainers."" Fellow Countdown star Susie Dentdescribed him as a ""true gent"",externalwhile Call the Midwife star Stephen McGann said O'Connor ""never took himself too seriously"". Melanie Sykes, who hosted TV show Today With Des And Mel alongside O'Connor, said it was an ""education and a privilege to work with him"". She wrote on Instagram: ""He had talent in every fibre of his being and was stubborn as a mule. He was the full ticket as a friend and colleague."" Broadcaster Tony Blackburn said ""he was a great entertainer and more importantly a very nice person"", and TV presenter Gyles Brandreth described him as ""the ultimate professional"". Speaking about his sketches with Morecambe and Wise, comedian David Baddiel said: ""RIP Des O' Connor. It's worth remembering how brilliant he is at his own expense in these sketches."" Northampton Town Football Club alsojoined the tributes,externalto their former reserve player. The club said: ""We are very sorry to learn of the passing of Des O'Connor. Des famously played for our reserve team on a few occasions just after World War Two. Our thoughts are with all who knew Des."" Violinist Sue Croot told the BBC she had always treasured a signed photograph O'Connor gave to her father Ronald Croot, who was helping out on a production of Cinderella at the Grand Theatre in Swansea in the late 1950s. ""Dad said that Des was just such fun to be around and that he was such a down-to-earth person,"" she said.

"The blaze on Saturday evening ripped through the intensive care unit at the hospital At least 10 people have been killed and several others seriously injured in a fire at a hospital treating coronavirus patients in Romania, officials say. The blaze broke out in the intensive care unit of the public hospital in the north-eastern city of Piatra Neamt. One doctor who tried to rescue patients is said to be in a critical condition after suffering serious burns. Romania's Health Minister Nelu Tataru told local media the fire was ""most likely triggered by a short circuit"". Austria locks down as new wave grips Europe How new lockdowns are changing life across Europe Mr Tataru said that other Covid patients being treated at the hospital were being transferred to another facility in the city of Iasi. The injured doctor, who is said to have suffered severe burning to most of his body, was being transferred to the capital, Bucharest, by a military plane, local media report. ""There are other medical staff who suffered burns, not only the doctor on duty,"" Mr Tataru said, adding that he was heading to Piatra Neamt following the incident at the hospital on Saturday evening. Eight of the victims were reportedly killed in the room where the fire broke out on the second floor, and two others in a room next to it. All were said have been receiving treatment for coronavirus. Many in the ward were on ventilators. The fire was believed to have spread quickly after it was fed oxygen by the supplies used to intubate patients, the health ministry said.

"Here are five things you need to know about the coronavirus pandemic this Sunday morning. We'll have another update for you on Monday. Suspicion of vaccines has been around almost as long as modern vaccines themselves. But now Labour is calling on the government to outlaw anti-vaccination ""fake news"" online. The partyis demanding financial and criminal penalties for social media firmsthat do not remove anti-vaccine misinformation from their platforms. Meanwhile, our Reality Check team looked into some of the most widely shared false claims about vaccines: about alleged plots to put microchips into people,the supposed re-engineering of our genetic code, and about safety. Bradford's main Muslim cemetery has been struggling to keep up with burials as the second wave of the pandemic has gathered pace. It will take some medical detective work to determine the cause of this increase in deaths, says Dr John Wright of Bradford Royal Infirmary,but multi-generational homes could be a factor. With non-essential shops in England due to reopen from 2 December,will there be a rush to buy Christmas cards?Or will we keep in touch in other ways? Experts predict fewer cards will be sold this year - but the allure of handwriting will mean they retain their charm amid lockdowns Bruniquel is one of France's most beautiful villages and about an hour north of Toulouse. Now, gone are the tourists and the streets are quiet, as the village,like the rest of France, endures a second Covid lockdown.

"Elon Musk said at the start of the pandemic that the ""panic"" could ""cause more harm than the virus"" Tech entrepreneur Elon Musk says he ""most likely"" has a ""moderate case"" of Covid-19 but has been ""getting wildly different results from different labs"". The boss of Tesla and SpaceX, who is 49, tweeted his symptoms were those of a ""minor cold"". On Friday he said he had been tested four times, with two positive and two negative results. Mr Musk appeared to play down concerns about the pandemic when it first hit. Covid-19 has now infected nearly 10.9 million people in the US. More than 245,000 people have died there, and more than 67,000 people are currently in hospital. Some 35 US states now require face coverings to be worn in public and many are urging residents to stick to social distancing amid fears their health care systems will be swamped with infected patients.

"This video can not be played Ephraim, a British-Nigerian activist at the heart of the End Sars protests in Lagos, talks about what he saw The Nigerian army has rejected claims it killed unarmed protesters at a rally in Lagos in October, saying its soldiers were firing blank bullets. Brigadier General Ahmed Taiwo presented video evidence to back up his claims made to a panel of inquiry. Amnesty International says 12 people were killed when soldiers opened fire on a protest about police brutality in the wealthy Lagos suburb of Lekki. Multiple eyewitnesses have told the BBC they saw soldiers shoot people. Some 1,000 protesters had gathered at the Lekki toll gate on 20 October to prevent cars using a major motorway. Soldiers were reportedly seen barricading the protest site moments before the shooting started. In video footage shared on social media at the time, shots could be heard as protesters sat down, locked arms and sang the national anthem together. Live footage was also streamed from the scene showing protesters tending to the wounded. The attack had followed days of protests against the much-hated police unit, the Special Anti-Robbery Squad (Sars), which had morphed into greater calls for better governance. Nigerian horror over #EndSars protest shootings In pictures: Nigeria's End Sars protests Brig Gen Taiwo told the judicial panel investigating alleged historic abuses by Sars there had been ""a lot of misinformation"" about his troops. Their ""only crime was to report for duty to protect us all"". Brig Gen Ahmed Taiwo vigorously defended his troops against accusations they killed unarmed protesters He pointed to video showing what appeared to be soldiers at the scene. ""You can see they are firing in the air, and firing blank ammunitions."" Responding to a claim that a witness had seen a dead body at the scene, he said ""the casualty she saw had been overcome by shock"", AFP news agency reports. It is not clear if he will respond to the many other accounts from eyewitnesses. Since the shooting those involved in the protests say they are being targeted by the government, the BBC's Mayeni Jones reports. A number of protesters and companies say their bank accounts have been frozen and others have been arrested. The passport of a lawyer who organised legal aid for the protesters was seized as she tried to leave the country, although it has now been returned to her. The protests which have changed Nigeria forever The young Nigerians who forced the president to back down Nationwide protests erupted on 8 October calling for an end to the Special Anti-Robbery Squad, which had been accused of widespread human rights violations, including illegal detention, torture and extrajudicial killings. President Muhammadu Buhari disbanded the squad a few days later, but the protests continued with demands for more changes in the security forces and reforms to the way the country is run.

Following the 20 October attack, Amnesty International Nigeria said it had evidence from hospital records and witnesses to show that ""the Nigerian military opened fire on thousands of people who were peacefully calling for good governance and an end to police brutality"". The Lagos state government said 30 people had been injured with one fatality. Lagos and other parts of Nigeria have seen buildings torched, shopping centres looted and prisons attacked since the shooting.

"Emergency laws to ""stamp out dangerous"" anti-vaccine content online should be introduced, Labour has said. The party is calling for financial and criminal penalties for social media firms that do not remove false scare stories about vaccines. It follows news of progress on the first effective coronavirus vaccine. The government said it took the issue ""extremely seriously"" with ""a major commitment"" from Facebook, Twitter and Google to tackle anti-vaccine content. Many social media platforms label false content as misleading or disputed - and all remove posts that contravene terms of service. But Labour said a commitment by platforms to remove content flagged by the government was not enough. Shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth said such content was ""exploiting people's fears, their mistrust of institutions and governments and spreading poison and harm"". He told BBC Breakfast his party wanted to work with the government on a cross-party basis to build trust and help promote take-up of the vaccine. Microchips, 'altered DNA' and other false vaccine rumours He said people would have legitimate questions about what the vaccine means for them, levels of immunity and whether the vaccine was appropriate for those with chronic health conditions. ""There's nothing wrong with asking those questions and strong public health messaging from the government, reinforced by us, will allay those fears,"" he said. Baseless conspiracy theories about a coronavirus vaccine have been spreading on social media for months - and the latest vaccine news rekindled these pre-existing narratives online. These includes false claims that the vaccine is a means of inserting microchips into the population, altering our DNA, or are even a weapon of genocide. Within hours of news breaking about the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine, comments and memes suggesting it will deliberately harm us were popping up in local Facebook groups, parent chats and on Instagram. This kind of disinformation is worlds away from legitimate concerns that a vaccine is safe and properly tested. Despite commitments to tackle falsehoods from social media sites and the government, a constant bubbling of conspiracies online looks to have already eroded trust for some in an effective vaccine. The anti-vax movement, which pre-dates the pandemic, is not the only thing responsible for the spread of this disinformation online. Pseudoscience figures with large online followings - who have spread other false claims such as linking coronavirus to 5G or suggesting the pandemic is a hoax - have also turned their attention to vaccines. There is no truth to the false and harmful claims they make - but that hasn't stopped them spilling into the average social media feed for weeks and impacting those who come across them. Meanwhile, a member of the government's scientific advisory group, Sage, has criticised ministers' strategy of ""flip-flopping"" between encouraging people to socialise and spend money - and tough lockdown restrictions in England. Professor John Edmunds said: ""We need to take a long-term view and be sensible and realise that we're going to have to have restrictions in place for some time. ""Yes, we can lift them when it's safe to do so, which will be primarily when large numbers of people have been vaccinated. ""But flip-flopping between encouraging people to mix socially, which is what you're doing by encouraging people to go to restaurants and bars, versus then immediately closing them again, isn't a very sensible way to run the epidemic."" How close are we to a coronavirus vaccine? Who will get the vaccine first and when can you have it? The national lockdown in England is currently due to end on 2 December, with a return to the tiered system of local restrictions. Prof Edmunds also criticised that system of lower to higher restrictions, saying it was not ""very well thought through"". Scotland has moved to a five-tier system of coronavirus restrictions. Wales has now ended a ""circuit breaker"" while Northern Ireland has extended its own temporary lockdown. A further 26,860 UK coronavirus cases were recorded on Saturday and 462 more deaths within 28 days of a positive test were reported. Suspicion of vaccines has been around almost as long as modern vaccines themselves. But in recent years, the anti-vaccination - or ""anti-vax""- movement has gained traction online. Social media has been blamed for allowing unfounded claims about vaccines to spread more easily. In 2019, the UKlost its measles-free statusdesignated by the World Health Organization - and there has been a marked decline in vaccination rates for all 13 diseases covered in jabs for children. Since the pandemic, anti-vaccination campaigners have moved their focus to the coronavirus. This video can not be played Health Correspondent Laura Foster explains what the latest Covid-19 vaccine news means In the letter to Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden, Labour said there were dedicated anti-vaccination groups online with hundreds of thousands of followers who were ""churning out disinformation"" on the issue. Last week,the government announced,externalthat social media companies had agreed a package of measures - including that no company should be profiting from Covid vaccine fake news. But Labour warned that the measures do not go far enough and has questioned why anti-vax groups are not being closed down. ""The announced collaboration with social media companies last week was welcome but feels grossly inadequate with a promise by them to remove only the content which is flagged by government and which generates profit,"" Labour said. Labour called for emergency legislation that would see financial and criminal penalties for a continued failure to act, and said they would vote for it. This video can not be played Research shows a number of young people may choose not to have a Covid-19 vaccination On Monday, news of a potential vaccine made headlines after preliminary results from Pfizer and BioNTech showed their vaccine could prevent more than 90% of people from catching Covid. The vaccine is one of 11 vaccines that are currently in the final stages of testing. Pfizer and BioNTech companies now plan to apply for emergency approval to use the vaccine by the end of November and a limited number of people may be given the vaccine this year. The UK has bought enough doses for 20 million people. But it will not be released for use in the UK until it passes final safety tests and gets the go-ahead from the MHRA - the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency. Thehead of the MHRA said this weekit will not lower its safety standards despite the need to get a Covid vaccine quickly.

"After the euphoria of a vaccine breakthrough, it did not take long for the virus to provide a reality check. Within days of the news that an effective vaccine may have been found, it was being announced the UK was the first European country to pass the grim milestone of 50,000 deaths. This was quickly followed by a record rise in new caseswith 33,400 reported on Thursday. Both are a clear reminder, if we needed one, that there are many more difficult days to come. So what's in store? Health Secretary Matt Hancock has promised the NHS will be ready to start rolling out the vaccine from 1 December if its passes its final regulatory hurdles. But that doesn't mean the epidemic will be brought to a sudden halt. There is a huge logistical exercise in vaccinating large numbers of people - the UK has bought enough for 20 million people. And don't forget, unlike the flu vaccine, this one requires two doses. Health and care workers along with older age groups will be prioritised. But given it takes a month from the first dose for an individual to get the full protection and the fact there are 12 million over 65s - nine in 10 deaths have been in this age group - winter is likely to be well gone by the time significant numbers are protected. England's deputy chief medical officer Prof Jonathan Van-Tam was unequivocal this week when he said he didn't see the vaccine ""making any difference"" this winter. Who will get the vaccine first and when can you have it? How the UK reached 50,000 coronavirus deaths In the meantime infection rates remain high. Despite seeing over 30,000 cases on Thursday, the UK is averaging over 20,000 confirmed infections a day. However, estimates from the government's surveillance run by the Office for National Statisticssuggests the true figure may be double that,external. The situation has left hospitals dangerously close to capacity in the most hard-hit regions. NHS trusts in Birmingham, Liverpool, Leeds, Nottingham and Bradford have all announced the cancellation of non-urgent work to free up beds. Chris Hopson, of NHS Providers, which represents hospital managers, warns staff are ""exhausted"" and ""traumatised"". If hospital cases keep rising it will quickly begin to affect non-Covid work even more, he says. We were always warned lockdown, which is under way in England, would take time to have an impact. The good news is that cases had started to stabilise before it came in, with strong evidence the regional tiers had begun to have an impact. If the rise in cases on Thursday is a blip - there are suggestions it may be linked to a last bout of socialising before lockdown came in - the expectation is the number of infections will soon start to drop. Friday's figures were 6,000 cases down on the day before, Prof Tim Spector, who runs the Covid Symptom Study, an app which one million people use, believes the crucial R number - the measure of how many people an infected person passes the virus on to on average - is now below one. This would mean the epidemic should start to shrink. But no-one knows exactly what sort of impact lockdown will have. There have been suggestions the number of infections could be reduced by three-quarters. But the early evidence from Wales' 17-day fire-break is that it stemmed the rise in cases rather than significantly shrinking it. There could be a delayed impact and England's lockdown is longer, but clearly nothing is guaranteed. Northern Ireland, meanwhile, has just extended some of its national restrictions because of concern about infection levels. And the problem is that once lockdown is lifted in England, cases are likely to take off again. It is, after all, winter, when respiratory viruses tend to thrive. Does that mean another lockdown in a few months? This is the nagging fear. Ministers are just ""deferring the problem"", says Prof Mark Woolhouse, an expert in infectious diseases at Edinburgh University, who sits on the government's committee on modelling. Even if we had had the lockdown earlier, as some scientists had argued, we would have already been talking about the next one. Those backing lockdown argued it could be used to fix the test-and-trace system, which identifies close contacts of infected individuals and asks them to isolate. Each nation runs its own tracing service, but all have faced the same problem - such high rates of infection make test-and-trace more difficult and less effective. In England, councils are working hard to set up local teams to support the national system. But most of these are in their infancy and will take some time to bed in. The government has started piloting mass testing in the hope it could be a way of containing the virus given significant numbers of infected people show very mild, or even no, symptoms. The first pilot in Liverpool has been followed by others being set up inmore than 60 local authority areas. Soldiers have been brought in to help with the mass testing programme in Liverpool But some question how effective this approach will be. The rapid tests being used are ""not fit for purpose"" says Prof John Deeks, an expert in testing at Birmingham University. He points to evidence suggesting they may miss up to half of Covid cases. He also says identifying previously undetected cases only works if those that test positive isolate. Evidence on those going through the standard testing process is that they are not always doing this. A need to work and earn money is, understandably, a key issue. This brings us back to vaccination. While the breakthrough is great news, the jury is still out as to how much impact it will have. For example, we don't know how well it works in the elderly, whether it stops people passing it on or simply stops them getting ill or how long immunity lasts. Even with the vaccine the virus is ""not going away"", says Sir Jeremy Farrar, a member of the government's Sage advisory group. It is, he says, now part of humanity and here to stay. Instead, the most we can hope for is providing some protection to those who are most at risk. The sad reality is that, despite the vaccine breakthrough, we are still going to have to learn to live with Covid this winter - and beyond.

"The number of school-age children with coronavirus has risen ""significantly"" in the second wave compared with the first, according to the government's scientific advisers. Children are now more likely than adults to be the person bringing a Covid infection into a household. But families with children are at no higher risk of severe illness. The National Education Union (NEU) said it was ""troubled"" by the number of children testing positive. The exact role children play in transmitting coronavirus has long been an open question. It's clear young people as a group are at very low risk of becoming seriously ill from the virus themselves. R number for UK has fallen closer to 1 There is also some evidence younger children are less likely to even contract it in the first place. But when it comes to older children, their role in passing on the virus has been much less clear. A review presented to government and published on 13 November outlines the growing evidence older children can catch and transmit Covid-19 at similar rates to adults. From around the time schools reopened in September, a rising number of children have been testing positive for coronavirus, according to the advisory group. But the paper said the extent to which transmission was occurring in schools was ""unproven and difficult to establish"". Two major surveillance studies by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) and Imperial College London show infections among people aged 16-24 were increasing in September. By October increases could be seen throughout the 2-24-year-old age bracket. There were signs of rising infection in the wider population before schools went back, however. The government's Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) has previously said reopening schools was likely to increase transmission of the virus. Chief Medical Officer for England Chris Whitty also acknowledged this, but said trade-offs would have to be made to allow schools to remain open while controlling the virus. The 13 November advisory paper said there were ""significant educational, developmental and mental health harms from schools being closed"". Schoolchildren and young adults have experienced a much faster rise in infections than other age groups in the second wave. Prof Mark Woolhouse at the University of Edinburgh said this was ""not surprising given that schools are operating much closer to normality than most other parts of society"". The review made clear it was not possible to separate contacts in school from contacts around school including travelling to and from, and socialising afterwards. UK coronavirus cases up by 27,301 on Friday However, teachers were no more likely to test positive for coronavirus than other workers, according to ONS data. Dr Sarah Lewis, an epidemiologist at the University of Bristol, said this was ""reassuring"" and suggested ""the measures in place to reduce transmission in schools are working"". People living with secondary-school-age children were 8% more likely to catch the virus. Butresearch by the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and the University of Oxfordfound that people living with under-18s had no increased risk of becoming seriously ill from Covid. The NEU said it was concerned by the ""finding that children aged 12-16 played a 'significantly higher role' in introducing infection into households in the period after schools reopened their doors to all students"". The union suggested this was down to ""the difficulty of social distancing, the absence of face masks inside classrooms, the problems of ventilation, the size of 'bubbles' and the cross mixing on school transport, as well as of secondary pupils mixing outside school"".

"The R number for the UK has fallen to between 1 and 1.2, the closest it's been to 1 since early September. It comes asthe Office for National Statistics,externalsays the number of people infected with coronavirus is slowing down. Data up to 6 November, the day after England's second lockdown began, shows infections falling in the north west but rising in the south and Midlands. In Northern Ireland, infection rates were levelling off, the ONS says. But in Wales rising infection levels were still continuing. And it's too early to say if they were stabilising a week ago in Scotland. Although growth may be slowing in some parts of the country, the government's scientific advisers say ""significant levels of healthcare demand and mortality will persist until R is reduced to and remains well below 1 for an extended period of time"". An estimate of the R number, or reproduction number, of the virus is published every week and based on a number of different sources of data, including the ONS infection survey. The ONS figures are based on thousands of swab tests in random households across the UK, thought to be one of the most reliable ways of judging how many people are infected with the virus - not just those with symptoms. The data for the week to 6 November shows: 1 in 85 people had the virus - or around 620,000 people in England 1 in 85 - or 35,300 people in Wales 1 in 105 - or 18,000 people in Northern Ireland 1 in 135 - or 40,000 people in Scotland In England, the number of new cases is stabilising at 50,000 per day, the ONS says. But infection rates appeared to be increasing in the south east, south west and East Midlands during that week where they had previously been low. Among teenagers and young adults, who have seen the highest levels of the virus, infection rates appear to be levelling off or even falling. Year-long waits for hospital care worst since 2008 How many confirmed cases are in your area? How the UK reached 50,000 coronavirus deaths Data fromthe Covid symptom app,external, based on one million people reporting symptoms, suggests cases are coming down across most areas of the UK - although numbers are still high. Their figures are based on 13,000 swab tests carried out by users during the two weeks up to 8 November. Government figures on lab-confirmed cases show a picture of rising cases in many regions of England, but falling in the north west. On Friday, there were 27,301 new confirmed cases of the virus in the UK - down froma record-high of 33,470 on Thursday. These represent people with symptoms who've received positive tests. Health officials said Thursday's rise could be a result of people being infected while socialising in the days before England's second lockdown started on 5 November. According to the latest data from Public Health England, infection rates are rising quickly in the over-80s, who are most at risk from Covid-19. PHE said limiting contact with others ""will help to stop the spread of the virus and protect the people we love"".

Microchips, 'altered DNA' and other false vaccine rumours He said people would have legitimate questions about what the vaccine means for them, levels of immunity and whether the vaccine was appropriate for those with chronic health conditions. ""There's nothing wrong with asking those questions and strong public health messaging from the government, reinforced by us, will allay those fears,"" he said. Baseless conspiracy theories about a coronavirus vaccine have been spreading on social media for months - and the latest vaccine news rekindled these pre-existing narratives online. These includes false claims that the vaccine is a means of inserting microchips into the population, altering our DNA, or are even a weapon of genocide. Within hours of news breaking about the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine, comments and memes suggesting it will deliberately harm us were popping up in local Facebook groups, parent chats and on Instagram. This kind of disinformation is worlds away from legitimate concerns that a vaccine is safe and properly tested. Despite commitments to tackle falsehoods from social media sites and the government, a constant bubbling of conspiracies online looks to have already eroded trust for some in an effective vaccine. The anti-vax movement, which pre-dates the pandemic, is not the only thing responsible for the spread of this disinformation online. Pseudoscience figures with large online followings - who have spread other false claims such as linking coronavirus to 5G or suggesting the pandemic is a hoax - have also turned their attention to vaccines. There is no truth to the false and harmful claims they make - but that hasn't stopped them spilling into the average social media feed for weeks and impacting those who come across them. Meanwhile, a member of the government's scientific advisory group, Sage, has criticised ministers' strategy of ""flip-flopping"" between encouraging people to socialise and spend money - and tough lockdown restrictions in England. Professor John Edmunds said: ""We need to take a long-term view and be sensible and realise that we're going to have to have restrictions in place for some time. ""Yes, we can lift them when it's safe to do so, which will be primarily when large numbers of people have been vaccinated. ""But flip-flopping between encouraging people to mix socially, which is what you're doing by encouraging people to go to restaurants and bars, versus then immediately closing them again, isn't a very sensible way to run the epidemic."" How close are we to a coronavirus vaccine? Who will get the vaccine first and when can you have it? The national lockdown in England is currently due to end on 2 December, with a return to the tiered system of local restrictions. Prof Edmunds also criticised that system of lower to higher restrictions, saying it was not ""very well thought through"". Scotland has moved to a five-tier system of coronavirus restrictions. Wales has now ended a ""circuit breaker"" while Northern Ireland has extended its own temporary lockdown. A further 26,860 UK coronavirus cases were recorded on Saturday and 462 more deaths within 28 days of a positive test were reported. Suspicion of vaccines has been around almost as long as modern vaccines themselves. But in recent years, the anti-vaccination - or ""anti-vax""- movement has gained traction online. Social media has been blamed for allowing unfounded claims about vaccines to spread more easily. In 2019, the UKlost its measles-free statusdesignated by the World Health Organization - and there has been a marked decline in vaccination rates for all 13 diseases covered in jabs for children. Since the pandemic, anti-vaccination campaigners have moved their focus to the coronavirus. This video can not be played Health Correspondent Laura Foster explains what the latest Covid-19 vaccine news means In the letter to Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden, Labour said there were dedicated anti-vaccination groups online with hundreds of thousands of followers who were ""churning out disinformation"" on the issue. Last week,the government announced,externalthat social media companies had agreed a package of measures - including that no company should be profiting from Covid vaccine fake news. But Labour warned that the measures do not go far enough and has questioned why anti-vax groups are not being closed down. ""The announced collaboration with social media companies last week was welcome but feels grossly inadequate with a promise by them to remove only the content which is flagged by government and which generates profit,"" Labour said. Labour called for emergency legislation that would see financial and criminal penalties for a continued failure to act, and said they would vote for it. This video can not be played Research shows a number of young people may choose not to have a Covid-19 vaccination On Monday, news of a potential vaccine made headlines after preliminary results from Pfizer and BioNTech showed their vaccine could prevent more than 90% of people from catching Covid. The vaccine is one of 11 vaccines that are currently in the final stages of testing. Pfizer and BioNTech companies now plan to apply for emergency approval to use the vaccine by the end of November and a limited number of people may be given the vaccine this year. The UK has bought enough doses for 20 million people. But it will not be released for use in the UK until it passes final safety tests and gets the go-ahead from the MHRA - the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency. Thehead of the MHRA said this weekit will not lower its safety standards despite the need to get a Covid vaccine quickly. This video can not be played Boris Johnson: âAnti-vax is total nonsense, you should definitely get a vaccine."" Earlier this year, Prime Minister Boris Johnson called people who oppose vaccinations ""nuts"". And this week, he said he had ""no inhibitions"" about getting one, adding: ""Anti-vax is total nonsense, you should definitely get a vaccine."" A government spokesperson said: ""Letting vaccine disinformation spread unchecked could cost British lives. ""We take this issue extremely seriously andhave secured a major commitment,externalfrom Facebook, Twitter and Google to tackle it by not profiting from such material, and by responding to flagged content more swiftly.

"This video can not be played ''We fled from death and murder'' The 12-day conflict between Ethiopia's government and forces in the country's Tigray region has escalated. The Tigrayan forces fired rockets across the border into neighbouring Eritrea, after claiming Ethiopian soldiers were using an Eritrean airport to attack Tigray. Ethiopia's prime minister appeared to deny the accusationsin a tweet,external. But analysts say the latest attacks mark a major uptick in a conflict which has displaced thousands of civilians. How Ethiopia's conflict could destabilise its neighbours Marooned by conflict: 'My little brother needs medicine' Ethiopia has been through big changes since Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed came to power in 2018. He was awarded the Nobel peace prize last year after reaching out to make peace with neighbouring Eritrea, with whom Ethiopia had fought a bloody war two decades ago. But the widespread reforms he pushed through sidelined the Tigrayans of the Tigray People's Liberation Front party (TPLF) who had long dominated the political scene - and in recent weeks, tensions between the party and the federal government seriously escalated. Animosity between the government in Tigray and Eritrea goes back a long way, according to the BBC's Africa regional editor Will Ross, who says much of it stems from that border war of 20 years ago which left tens of thousands of soldiers dead. On Sunday, the Ethiopian Human Rights Commission said gunmen had killed at least 34 people on a passenger bus on Saturday night in the western region of Benishangul-Gumuz. The region has seen other acts of violence recently and there has so far been no known link with the Tigray region. On Saturday night, residents of Asmara - Eritrea's capital - reported hearing loud explosions, amid reports of rockets landing near the city's airport. No casualties have been reported yet. Tigrayan leader Debretsion Gebremichael has suggested that his forces have been fighting 16 divisions of the Eritrean army on several fronts for the past few days. The Tigrayans have also accused Eritrean forces of crossing into Ethiopia to back federal forces there. On Sunday,in a tweet,external, Mr Abiy appeared to deny that Ethiopian national forces were working with Eritreans, saying that Ethiopia was ""more than capable of attaining the objectives of the operation by itself"". But while Eritrea and Ethiopia have denied co-operating in the conflict, our regional editor says reports of fighting along the border, and of Ethiopian soldiers being treated in Eritrean hospitals, suggest the opposite is true. By Will Ross, BBC Africa regional editor With missiles being fired into Eritrea this conflict has now become far more serious and is likely to be harder to stop. The repercussions could now cause instability in the whole region. But many people familiar with recent political developments had predicted trouble was brewing when Ethiopia's Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed  became a strong ally of Eritrea's authoritarian leader, Isaias Afwerki. Now the two men have a common enemy - the Tigrayan politicians of the TPLF who dominated Ethiopia's political scene for years, including the time when Ethiopia and Eritrea fought a border war that left tens of thousands dead. International calls for dialogue have so far been ignored and thousands of civilian refugees continue to flee the fighting into Sudan. Hundreds have died in Ethiopia since the fighting began, with reports of a civilian massacre emerging this week. Human rights groupAmnesty International said it had confirmed that ""scores, and likely hundreds, of people were stabbed or hacked to death"" in the town of Mai-Kadra (May Cadera),externalon Monday. Why there are fears of civil war in Ethiopia Fake news being shared over Ethiopia conflict Read more about life in Tigray Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed has accused forces loyal to Tigray's leaders of carrying out the mass killings, while the TPLF has denied involvement. Ethiopia's human rights commission said it would send a team to investigate. The TPLF dominated Ethiopia's military and political life for decades before Mr Abiy took office in 2018 and pushed through major reforms. Last year, Mr Abiy dissolved the ruling coalition, made up of several ethnically based regional parties, and merged them into a single, national party, which the TPLF refused to join. This video can not be played Four things that explain the crisis in the Tigray region of Ethiopia The feud escalated in September, when Tigray held a regional election, defying a nationwide ban on all polls imposed because of the coronavirus pandemic. Mr Abiy responded by calling the vote illegal. Tigray's administration sees Mr Abiy's reforms as an attempt to hand his central government more power and weaken regional states. It also resents what it calls the prime minister's ""unprincipled"" friendship with Eritrean President Isaias Afwerki. Mr Abiy won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2019 for his efforts to bring peace with Eritrea. The prime minister believes TPLF officials are undermining his authority. Mr Abiy ordered the military operation against the TPLF after he said its fighters had crossed ""the last red line"".  He accused them of attacking a military camp hosting federal troops on 4 November, calling the action ""treasonous"". The TPLF has denied attacking the camp.

"This video can not be played President Trump drove through the protest on his way to his golf course Thousands of supporters of US President Donald Trump turned out in Washington DC to back his unsubstantiated claims of voter fraud in the election. Flag-carrying demonstrators were joined by members of far-right groups including the Proud Boys, some wearing helmets and bullet-proof vests. The largely peaceful demonstration saw some violence later in the evening, as Trump supporters and counter-protesters clashed in several skirmishes. Joe Biden won the 3 November election. On Friday, he solidified his victory with a projected win in the state of Georgia - making him the first Democratic candidate to take the state since 1992. He now has 306 votes in the electoral college - the system the US uses to choose its president - which far exceeds the 270 threshold to win. US Election results in full The 'dead voters' who are still alive How will this endless US election end? However, Mr Trump has so far refused to concede. He has launched a flurry of legal challenges in key states and made unsubstantiated allegations of widespread electoral fraud - but his efforts have so far been unsuccessful. This video can not be played What do Trump supporters think of a Biden presidency? Mr Trump's supporters kicked off the demonstrations at about noon local time (17:00 GMT) on Saturday near Freedom Plaza, just east of the White House, and later headed towards the Supreme Court. As well as more mainstream Trump supporters, members of the far-right Proud Boys and the Oath Keepers militia group were among the marchers. Conspiracy theorist Alex Jones addressed the crowd. Who are Proud Boys? Members of far-right, anti-immigrant group Proud Boys marched through downtown Washington Mr Trump's motorcade passed the gathering demonstrators on Saturday morning and did a circuit of nearby Freedom Plaza, but he carried on to his golf club in Sterling, Virginia without addressing the crowds. He laterretweeted video of protesters, posted by White House official Dan Scavino, vowing ""We will WIN!,external"" While the daytime event was largely orderly, Trump supporters clashed with counter-demonstrators in the night. Video footage posted on social media showed fights breaking out. Officials said 20 people had been arrested on a variety of charges, including assault and weapons possession. One stabbing was reported. Two police officers were also injured. At the scene - Will Grant, BBC News, Washington DC A gradual stream of pro-Trump supporters made its way towards Freedom Plaza, adorned with T-shirts and carrying placards which read ""Stop the Steal"" and ""Trump 2020"". The demonstrators were also identifiable by their lack of face-masks as many participants rejected measures to contain the spread of coronavirus. In that regard alone, this pro-Trump rally was seen by its critics as reckless and irresponsible. It took place with the United States grappling with some of its worst Covid-19 infection rates since the pandemic began, with more than 180,000 new cases and 1,400 deaths recorded in the country over the past 24 hours. None of that appeared to matter much to the participants who excitedly greeted President Trump's motorcade as it made an impromptu pass around the plaza. They are desperate to see this election result overturned and fully back his unsubstantiated claims of election fraud and his refusal to concede. Still, although they may deny it, there is a growing sense of a fight losing its energy and that - like it or not - these supporters will see President-elect Joe Biden in the White House in January. The president continues to dispute the election result. In a slew of tweets on Saturday, he said checks on ballots in Georgia were a ""waste of time"", alleging problems with signatures but without giving evidence. A manual recount is to be carried out in Georgia because of the narrow margin between the two candidates, but this is not expected to change the results there. On Friday,election officials said the vote was the ""most secure in American history"", the most direct rebuttal from federal and state authorities of the president's claims. This video can not be played President Trump: ""Who knows which administration it will be. I guess time will tell"" On Friday, White House spokeswoman Kayleigh McEnany told Fox News: ""President Trump believes he will be President Trump, have a second term."" However, Mr Trump's efforts to overturn the result suffered three setbacks on Friday: In Arizona, his team dropped a lawsuit seeking a review of ballots cast on Election Day after it became clear his rival's lead was unassailable. The challenge was based on a claim that some legal votes had been rejected In Michigan, a judge rejected a request by two Republican poll watchers - who had alleged fraud in Wayne County - to block the certification of election results in Detroit In Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, the Trump campaign's requests to invalidate several batches of mail-in ballots were rejected This video can not be played Obama: Claims of election fraud are ""delegitimising"" democracy Pressure is growing on Mr Trump to acknowledge Mr Biden's victory and help prepare the transition from one administration to another. The General Services Administration (GSA), the government agency tasked with beginning the process, has yet to recognise Mr Biden and his running mate Kamala Harris as winners. The Biden team have not been given access to classified security briefings, federal agencies and funding needed to ensure a smooth transition of power. Biden spokesperson Jen Psaki said this lack of access could affect Mr Biden's ability to govern. ""You need real-time information to deal with crises of the moment,"" she said, highlighting the impact of the pandemic. ""It's imperative that our team and our experts have that access."" Adding his voice to those calls, President Trump's former chief of staff, John Kelly, said the delay in starting the transition was hurting national security.""It's not a process where you go from zero to 1,000 miles per hour,"",externalhe told Politico. A small but growing number of Republicans are also backing calls for the president-elect to be given daily intelligence briefings. What happens now?
