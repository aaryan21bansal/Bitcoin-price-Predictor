"Colin Spencer has been working as a lollipop man for 14 years A ban stopping an 83-year-old lollipop man from high-fiving schoolchildren has been lifted in a council U-turn. Colin Spencer has worked as a lollipop man for St George's Primary School in Heaviley, Stockport, for 14 years. Stockport Councilangered parents last weekwhen it ordered him to stop the high-fives to ""concentrate on ensuring highway safety"". However, the council has now apologised and admitted it was ""clearly wrong"" to impose the ban. Parents had described how they were sent a text message on Tuesday via the school asking them to tell their children not to high-five Mr Spencer on the road. A text the following day said children could high-five Mr Spencer - but only on the pavement. Block of ice crashes to earth near Kew Gardens - BBC News The Quaker dwarf who fought slavery Compensation claim over 'sonic boom' Mr Spencer had previously said the decision had left some pupils in tears, unable to understand why he could no longer high-five them on the road. In its latest statement the council said: ""Following the recent reports surrounding Stockport Council's lollipop man, Colin Spencer, we want to apologise for the unnecessary concern caused by the issuing of an instruction that was clearly wrong"". The council said it was ""clearly wrong"" to impose the ban on the high-fives Sheila Bailey, the council's executive member for communities and housing, added: ""Colin has been an outstanding public servant and a popular member of his community for many years. ""It's fantastic that he works with a smile on his face and brightens up the day for so many children."" Ms Bailey added: ""We try to make the service as safe as possible as well as maintaining the unique personalities that each member of the team brings to their school. We are sorry, that on this occasion, the council got it wrong."" Dawn St Clare, whose children go to the school, told the BBC last week she thought the ruling was ""ridiculous"" and had annoyed parents and upset pupils.

"Labour's proposal to bring services such as water, energy and rail into public ownership would be ""cost free"", John McDonnell has said. The shadow chancellor says he wants to put public services ""irreversibly in the hands of workers"" so they can ""never again be taken away"". In a speech in London, Mr McDonnell said privatisation had failed. However, the Conservatives said his plan would cost taxpayers billions of pounds and lead to worse services. Earlier, Mr McDonnell told BBC Radio 4's Today programme taking services into public ownership would not ultimately increase the burden on taxpayers because government bonds could be swapped for shares in a revenue-producing company. ""It would be cost free. You borrow to buy an asset and when that asset is producing profits like the water industry does, that will cover your borrowing cost,"" he said. A report earlier this week by the Social Market Foundation, commissioned by a group of water companies, estimated thatthe up-front costs of renationalisation would be Â£90bn,external. 'I want to break the stigma of painful sex' Pence skips Olympic meal with North Koreans French Muslim quits talent show amid row But Mr McDonnell said utilities could be managed more efficiently under public ownership, because they would no longer have to fund dividends for shareholders. ""They've given out Â£18bn of dividends to their shareholders - sometimes they've actually given out more in dividends than they've made in profits,"" he told the BBC. In his speech to Labour's Alternative Models of Ownership conference, Mr McDonnell said the best way to protect public services for the long term was for them to be owned by the public. This video can not be played Labour to help local councils bring public services in-house He said: ""The next Labour government will put democratically owned and managed public services irreversibly in the hands of workers and of those who rely on their work."" Public services could be made more responsive and effective by bringing together the people who use them, workers and expert managers, the shadow chancellor said. He said: ""We aren't going to take back control of these industries in order to put them into the hands of a remote bureaucracy, but to put them into the hands of all of you - so that they can never again be taken away. ""Public ownership is not just a political decision, it's an economic necessity. ""We'll move away from the failed privatisation model of the past, developing new democratic forms of ownership, joining other countries, regions and cities across the world in taking control of our essential services."" by Joe Lynam, BBC business correspondent It's not unusual for private companies in trouble to do a ""debt for equity swap"". To save the business, those investors who own shares (equity) lose everything, and those investors who own the company's less risky bonds (debt) get those shares. Swapping government debt for private company shares is unusual though. In theory, the Treasury could issue new government bonds - known as gilts - and hand them over to the private owners of water or electricity companies. That would then make taxpayers shareholders in the utility in question. But all the existing contracts would continue in force. So salaries and bonuses would have to be honoured, as would contracts with all other private sector suppliers. The new owners (taxpayers) would also need to retain experienced staff to do often very specialised work. If those skilled staff thought they'd earn more in the private sector, that may be an issue. Treasury Chief Secretary Liz Truss said: ""Labour would put politicians in charge of running everything from the phone lines to electricity supply, meaning people have nowhere to turn when things go wrong. That didn't work last time and won't work this time."" And UK business group the CBI said Labour's calls for nationalisation would ""wind the clock back on our economy"". Its managing director for people and infrastructure Neil Carberry said: ""If Labour turns its back on good collaboration between the government and the private sector, public services, infrastructure and taxpayers will ultimately pay the price."" In the speech, Mr McDonnell also announced the creation of a working group to look at how co-operatives can grow, expand and access funding, including the possibility of giving employees a greater right to own shares in the company they work for.

"The Israeli F-16 jet crashed near a village in northern Israel An Israeli F-16 fighter jet has crashed after being hit by Syrian air defences during an offensive in Syria, the Israeli military says. The two pilots parachuted to safety before the crash in northern Israel. It is believed to be the first time Israel has lost a jet in the Syrian conflict. The plane was hit during air strikes in response to an Iranian drone launch into Israeli territory, Israel says. The drone was shot down. Israel later launched further strikes in Syria. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) say they hit aerial defence batteries and Iranian military sites in the latest strikes. Israeli air strikes in Syria are not unusual, the BBC's Middle East correspondent Tom Bateman says, but the loss of an Israeli fighter jet marks a serious escalation. Israel 'strikes Damascus military complex' Why is there a war in Syria? In other developments in the Syrian conflict on Saturday: A Turkish helicopter was shot down as the country continued its offensive against Kurdish fighters in northern Syria. Two soldiers on board were killed, the Turkish military says UN Human Rights Commissioner Zeid Ra'ad al-Hussein said the past week was one of the bloodiest in Syria since the conflict began in 2011 - with at least 277 civilian deaths reported The Israeli military says a ""combat helicopter successfully intercepted an Iranian UAV [unmanned aerial vehicle] that was launched from Syria and infiltrated Israel"".

In a further response, the IDF ""targeted Iranian targets in Syria"", according to the military. The mission deep inside Syrian territory was successfully completed, it said. After coming under Syrian anti-aircraft fire, the F-16's two crew members ejected and were later taken to hospital. One of them was ""severely injured as a result of an emergency evacuation"", the IDF said. It is the first time Israel has lost an aircraft in combat since 2006,externalwhen an Israeli helicopter was shot down over Lebanon by a Hezbollah rocket, the Jerusalem Post reports. All five crew on board - including a female flight mechanic - were killed in that incident. Anti-aircraft fire smoke over the Syrian-Israeli border in the Golan Heights Alert sirens sounded in areas of northern Israel and the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights because of Syrian anti-aircraft fire. Residents reported hearing a number of explosions and heavy aerial activity in the area near Israel's borders with Jordan and Syria. The fighter jet was carrying out strikes on Iranian targets in Syria, the Israelis say (file picture) Syrian state media quoted a military source as saying that the country's air defences had opened fire in response to Israeli ""aggression"" against a military base on Saturday, hitting ""more than one plane"". Israel launched its second wave of strikes in Syria. Eight of the Syrian targets belonged to the fourth Syrian division near Damascus, IDF spokesman Jonathan Conricus said. All the Israeli aircraft from this sortie returned safely. ""Syrians are playing with fire when they allow Iranians to attack Israel,"" the spokesman warned. He added that Israel was willing to exact a heavy price in response but was ""are not looking to escalate the situation"". Meanwhile Iran and the Tehran-backed Hezbollah movement in Lebanon - which are allied with the Syrian government - dismissed reports that an Iranian drone had entered Israeli airspace as a ""lie"". Russia expressed ""serious concern"" over the Israeli air strikes and called for all sides to show restraint. Iran is Israel's arch-enemy, and Iranian troops have been fighting rebel groups since 2011. Tehran has sent military advisers, volunteer militias and, reportedly, hundreds of fighters from its Quds Force, the overseas arm of the Iranian Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC). It is also believed to have supplied thousands of tonnes of weaponry and munitions to help President Bashar al-Assad's forces and the pro-Iranian Hezbollah, which is fighting on Syria's side. Tehran has faced accusations that it is seeking to establish not just an arc of influence but a logistical land supply line from Iran through to Hezbollah in Lebanon. Analysis by BBC's diplomatic correspondent Jonathan Marcus For years Israel has been striking at weapons stores and other facilities in Syria with a single goal - to disrupt and, as far as possible, to prevent advanced Iranian missiles being delivered to Hezbollah in Lebanon. Syria has often been the conduit for these shipments, but the changing balance of power there, with the Assad regime's survival bolstered by Iranian help, has introduced a powerful new element - a direct Iranian role in the crisis. A more confident Iran is alleged by Israel to be setting up bases in Syria(whether for its own or its proxy Shia Muslim militia forces is unclear). But it is also alleged to be developing missile factories, both there and in Lebanon, to make the supply lines to Hezbollah less vulnerable. Israel's campaign to disrupt missile supplies is becoming ever more complex. And Iran risks becoming a direct actor in this conflict, ever closer to Israel's own borders.

It is also believed to have supplied thousands of tonnes of weaponry and munitions to help President Bashar al-Assad's forces and the pro-Iranian Hezbollah, which is fighting on Syria's side. Tehran has faced accusations that it is seeking to establish not just an arc of influence but a logistical land supply line from Iran through to Hezbollah in Lebanon. Analysis by BBC's diplomatic correspondent Jonathan Marcus For years Israel has been striking at weapons stores and other facilities in Syria with a single goal - to disrupt and, as far as possible, to prevent advanced Iranian missiles being delivered to Hezbollah in Lebanon. Syria has often been the conduit for these shipments, but the changing balance of power there, with the survival of the regime of President Bashar al-Assad bolstered by Iranian help, has introduced a powerful new element - a direct Iranian role in the crisis. A more confident Iran is alleged by Israel to be setting up bases in Syria(whether for its own or its proxy Shia Muslim militia forces is unclear). But it is also alleged to be developing missile factories, both there and in Lebanon, to make the supply lines to Hezbollah less vulnerable. Israel's campaign to disrupt missile supplies is becoming ever more complex. And Iran risks becoming a direct actor in this conflict, ever closer to Israel's own borders.

"This video can not be played Myanmar must find a safe and dignified way for Rohingya Muslims to return, Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson has said. Myanmar must find a safe and dignified way for Rohingya Muslims to return, the UK foreign secretary has said, after meeting the government of Bangladesh. Boris Johnson has been visiting camps on the Bangladesh border that hold the refugees who fled Myanmar to escape a military crackdown. Nearly 700,000 people have left since the action began last August. Mr Johnson will now fly to Myanmar, where he is due to meet de facto leader Aung San Suu Kyi on Sunday. More than 500,000 refugees are currently living in Cox's Bazar camp in Bangladesh - equivalent in size to Leicester. Mr Johnson toured the camp and afterwards said the ""horrendous living conditions"" further strengthened his commitment to finding a solution. Boris Johnson visited Cox's Bazar refugee camp as part of the first official trip to Bangladesh by a foreign secretary in a decade The foreign secretary paid tribute to the ""hospitality and compassion"" of the Bangladeshi government in providing humanitarian assistance to the Rohingya community, but emphasised refugee rights must be respected. ""It is vital that the Rohingya refugees must be allowed to their homes in Rakhine voluntarily, in safety and with dignity, under international oversight, and when the conditions in Burma are right,"" he said. Rohingya crisis: Repatriation timeframe agreed Seeing through the official story in Myanmar What you need to know about the crisis Earlier Mr Johnson met Bangladeshi Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina and Foreign Minister Abul Hassan Mahmud Ali. ""I was really struck by how Bangladesh and the UK really share a common analysis of what needs to be done. We need to make those points together to the government in Nay Pyi Daw,"" he said. The United Nations has described the exodus of Rohingya people from Rakhine state, and the military offensive which provoked it, as a ""textbook example of ethnic cleansing"". Neighbouring Bangladesh has agreed a timeframe with Myanmar for repatriating Rohingya people. But aid agencies have expressed concern over the projected figures for the transfer - Myanmar has agreed to accept 1,500 Rohingya each week; Bangladesh says it aims to return everyone within two years. And the refugees are worried about the conditions and their rights upon their return. Mr Johnson met young refugees at the camp ahead of diplomatic talks to attempt to resolve the crisis When Mr Johnson meets Ms Suu Kyi on Sunday he is expected to discuss the Rakhine crisis and press for the safe return of refugees. Mr Johnson will also meet the chair of the Advisory Board on the Rakhine Advisory Commission, Surakiart Sathirathai. It is looking at the problems in Rakhine state. Britain is one of the biggest direct donors of aid for the humanitarian effort to help the refugees. The foreign secretary's trip to Bangladesh is the first such official visit in a decade. He will go on to Bangkok, Thailand, for talks with Thai Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha.

FT: England 12-6 Wales England full-back Mike Brown talking to ITV Sport:""The effort to a man was unbelievable - Sam Underhill in the corner saving us, Maro Itoje hitting people around the corner - it was special, particularly from the forwards. ""We always want to hit teams first and take the momentum away from them. We maybe knocked off a bit in the middle but we will look at that again. Asked about Gareth Anscombe's disallowed score:""You work hard and you get your luck. The TMO is there to make those calls."" #bbcsixnations or text 81111 Llwchwrjack:England had a lot of ball but the fact remains if Anscombes try was given, which it should have been, we might have won. Matthew Thorne:What. A. Game. That was test match rugby at its finest. Nothing but 100% intensity for the whole match. This is why the six nations is the greatest sporting event in the world! A gutsy England win. Chrissymitch:England very lucky to won there, TMO cost Wales a perfect try that would of been it. Plus Wales left 2 or 3 tries out there. Hang your head in shame TMO. FT: England 12-6 Wales Matt DawsonFormer Lions and England scrum-half on BBC Radio 5 live Itâs been a cracking game today. A really good England-Wales Test match. The difference between the sides was that England didnât make mistakes and were very disciplined.
Is that a good enough performance to build on to go towards a Grand Slam though? I'm not
sure. England 12-6 Wales England were sweating it in the end, but Wales' rally came too little too late. Jonny May's double-whammy of first-half tries left them with too much ground to make up ultimately. FT: England 12-6 Wales Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"This video can not be played Mary Lou McDonald succeeds Gerry Adams as Sinn FÃ©in leader Mary Lou McDonald has been formally elected as leader of Sinn FÃ©in, replacing Gerry Adams who led the party for almost 35 years. Mr Adams, 69,announced his intention to quit the role in Novemberin a move that signalled a generational shift in the Sinn FÃ©in leadership. Ms McDonald, 48, said she was ""humbled"" to lead ""Ireland's oldest and greatest political party"". Michelle O'Neill, 41, has also been installed as Sinn FÃ©in vice president. The elections took place at a special ard fhÃ©is (party conference) in Dublin. McDonald set to be new Sinn FÃ©in president 'Marmite' Mary Lou McDonald O'Neill set to become new Sinn FÃ©in VP Mary Lou McDonald and Michelle O'Neill at their party conference in Dublin Ms McDonald paid tribute to Mr Adams, saying there would have been no peace process and no Good Friday Agreement without him. She described him as her political mentor, an ""inspirational"" leader and a ""great friend"". In her first speech as leader, she warned that Brexit represents a real threat to the prosperity and political life of Ireland. ""There can be no imposition of a border on the island of Ireland, that message must go loud and clear from our ard fhÃ©is today.  Ireland will not be the collateral damage in the political games and antics of the Tories in London."" Mary Lou McDonald described Gerry Adams as her mentor and friend Turning to the talks at Stormont, she pledged that her party was up for a deal. ""The Sinn FÃ©in team is committed to a positive outcome.  As UachtarÃ¡n Shinn FÃ©in (Sinn FÃ©in leader) I look forward to working with the DUP and with the other parties in the north."" Michelle O'Neill told the ard fhÃ©is that she expected the talks to restore devolution at Stormont to conclude next week. ""I believe that the issues which caused the collapse of Stormont can be resolved with political will and mutual respect,"" she said. ""Issues like marriage equality, an Irish language act, legacy inquests, rights, respect and integrity in government should not be politically contentious. Michelle O'Neill and Mary Lou McDonald at the ard fhÃ©is in Dublin ""A restored executive with genuine power-sharing at its heart and acting in the interests of all people."" Mrs O'Neill said it was vital to heal the pain of the past. ""Part of reconciliation involves recognising everyone's right to remember their dead,"" she said. ""But what's required is a unionist partner to help lead this crucial effort together."" Gerry Adams pictured in the audience at the ard fhÃ©is Mrs O'Neill called for a referendum on a united Ireland. ""We must face outwards and listen to those who don't want a united Ireland,"" she said. ""It is our task to persuade those people, sectors and communities of why it's in their best economic and political interests to share power across this island."" Saturday's elections were a formality as both women ran unopposed for the leadership roles. Mr Adams is one of the most prominent and controversial Irish politicians and his political legacy will divide opinion sharply. This video can not be played Gerry Adams: In his own words Speaking on Friday night, he said he was ""confident"" that the new leadership would ""help make Sinn FÃ©in even bigger and stronger in the time ahead"". ""Fifty years ago when I joined Sinn FÃ©in, it was a banned party,"" he said. Gerry Adams with Michelle O'Neill and Mary Lou McDonald ""The nationalist people of the north had been abandoned and were subject to discrimination and inequality. We were on our knees. We are now off our knees. ""We have a Good Friday Agreement. It is in some difficulty at this time. But it offers the way forward."" The leadership change comes almost 20 years after the 1998 Good Friday Agreement, but it also comes at a time of great political uncertainty. Northern Ireland has been without a devolved government sinceMartin McGuiness quit as deputy first minister in January 2017, in a move which caused the assembly to collapse. Gerry Adams pictured leaving Stormont on his last night as leader of Sinn FÃ©in He pulled Sinn FÃ©in out of its power-sharing coalition with the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), objecting to their handling ofa scandal over green energy scheme. Several rounds of talks aimed at restoring devolution have failed, but there is nowgrowing speculation that a deal could be unveiled as early as next week. Ms McDonald and Mrs O'Neill have been present all week at talks in Stormont which have been described as a last ditch attempt to restore power-sharing. Mrs O'Neill has been the party's leader north of the Irish border for just over a year, havingtaken over from the late Martin McGuiness in January 2017. Mary Lou McDonald (left) and Michelle O'Neill ran unopposed for their new roles Sinn FÃ©in sources have said that the talks are at a crucial stage. They are taking place against the complicated backdrop of Brexit and the way it impinges on economic and political matters, both in Anglo-Irish relations and in cross-border co-operation. As Mr Adams left the Stormont talks on Friday night - for the last time as Sinn FÃ©in leader - he said: ""It isn't sorted out as we speak. ""We have made some progress but there are still considerable obstacles. But, as I said to our unionist friends, this is the last chance agreement.""

"If I had Elon Musk-type money, I would hire a top-notch art gallery curator to clean my house. I would happily be the assistant, undertaking the most menial tasks while the duster-wielding curator concentrated on doing what curators do better than anyone else in the world, which is to arrange things really nicely. Making the shabby chic, transforming a total mess into a harmonious, tonal, soul-calming, eye-pleasing composition is the curator's art. It is a form of alchemy that is genuinely a wonder to behold. You will know this if you've ever been to Kettle's Yard in Cambridge, the former home of one-time Tate Gallery curator Jim Ede and his wife Helen. Jim Ede bought Kettle's Yard in the 1950s From the leather roundel you pull to gain entry, to the Brancusi sculpture of a reclining head placed casually on the lid of a grand piano, every inch, every sightline, has been meticulously considered and intricately planned to deliver the ultimate aesthetic experience. Prometheus by Brancusi Jim gave as much curatorial care and attention to arranging the pebbles he picked up on the beach as he did to his splendid collection of modernist art. Everything mattered. For instance, in the front room there is a small Joan Miro surrealist painting hanging above a spiralled, totemic wooden cider press, to the side of which is a large pewter plate. On that plate is a single fresh lemon, placed on the outer rim and positioned at precisely nine o'clock. Why? Because the fruit's bright yellowness accentuates the solemn greyness of the pewter while also echoing the small lemon shape in Miro's painting, which is at about three o'clock in the picture. As far as the Edes were concerned, the devil wasn't in the detail, beauty was. Tic Tic (1927) by Joan Miro There are hundreds of similar curatorial touches to enjoy as you make your way around the house, which was once four small slum cottages before Jim and Helen bought and renovated them into one dwelling in 1957. Their attention to detail didn't stop at the objects, or even the display thereof; it encompassed the entire experience, most particularly how light affects everything we see and sense. Their idea was to keep ""open house"" every afternoon of the academic term for students and anyone else so inclined to visit ""a living place where works of art could be enjoyed, inherent to the domestic"". It was ""in no way meant to be an art gallery or museum"". That was in the late 50s. In 1966, while still living at Kettle's Yard, the Edes gave the house, its contents, and the majority of their art collection to the University of Cambridge. Before long, the initial trickle of one or two interested students a day had turned into mass of tens, then hundreds, and eventually many thousands of visitors a year. A sympathetic, Le Corbusier-inspired extension was built in 1970 by Sir Leslie Martin and David Owers to accommodate the ever-expanding number of artworks, artefacts and art lovers. The Edes left in 1973 to live in peace and quiet in Scotland. Since then, Kettle's Yard has continued to develop in a slightly haphazard fashion, until the decision was made a few years ago to employ Jamie Fobert (the go-to art world architect for sensitive design projects) to bring some order to the site by creating a new suite of galleries, education spaces, and offices. On Saturday, they open to the public, who will be the first beneficiaries of a proper reception area, cafe and shop. Kettleâs Yard is reopening after an Â£11.3 million redevelopment by architect Jamie Fobert The new galleries are fine, and they have some nice touches, and I'm sure lots of modern art will look good in them. But I have to admit to being just a little bit disappointed by the rather hackneyed combination of concrete floor, smooth white wall and double-height ceiling. Such spaces are two-a-penny nowadays. They are like Prada stores and Range Rovers, classy but now irritatingly ubiquitous; chilly corporate spaces beloved by big-shot art dealers and major modern art museums. They struck me to be at odds with the Edes' founding principle of seeing art in a domestic setting. It's probably my fault for being a hopeless romantic, and I'm sure I'll enjoy many exhibitions held in them over the coming years (the inaugural show, Actions. The Image of the World Can Be Different feels like a limbering up exercise), but I can't help wondering if they are an opportunity missed. The Edes' taste was for mottled walls, light timber, and local brick. Domestic materials. I didn't detect an obvious love for polished concrete or austere environments. But this is only a small gripe about one of the great oases of culture in an increasingly vulgar world. The updating of Kettle's Yard was necessary and it has been done lovingly and thoughtfully by a team who care passionately about it - and us. Rana Begum's installation of bamboo baskets, No. 764 Baskets at St Peter's Church, Cambridge When you go, and I urge you to do so, make the time to pop into the small church by the house which has a sculptural installation made from baskets by the artist Rana Begum. It is quiet and sensitive with an inherent warmth that completely captures the spirit of Kettle's Yard.

Since then, Kettle's Yard has continued to develop in a slightly haphazard fashion, until the decision was made a few years ago to employ Jamie Fobert (the go-to art world architect for sensitive design projects) to bring some order to the site by creating a new suite of galleries, education spaces, and offices. On Saturday, they open to the public, who will be the first beneficiaries of a proper reception area, cafe and shop. Kettleâs Yard is reopening after an Â£11.3 million redevelopment by architect Jamie Fobert The new galleries are fine, and they have some nice touches, and I'm sure lots of modern art will look good in them. But I have to admit to being just a little bit disappointed by the rather hackneyed combination of concrete floor, smooth white wall and double-height ceiling. Such spaces are two-a-penny nowadays. They are like Prada stores and Range Rovers, classy but now irritatingly ubiquitous; chilly corporate spaces beloved by big-shot art dealers and major modern art museums. They struck me to be at odds with the Edes' founding principle of seeing art in a domestic setting. It's probably my fault for being a hopeless romantic, and I'm sure I'll enjoy many exhibitions held in them over the coming years (the inaugural show, Actions. The Image of the World Can Be Different feels like a limbering up exercise), but I can't help wondering if they are an opportunity missed. The Edes' taste was for mottled walls, light timber, and local brick. Domestic materials. I didn't detect an obvious love for polished concrete or austere environments. But this is only a small gripe about one of the great oases of culture in an increasingly vulgar world. The updating of Kettle's Yard was necessary and it has been done lovingly and thoughtfully by a team who care passionately about it - and us. Rana Begum's installation of bamboo baskets, No. 764 Baskets at St Peter's Church, Cambridge When you go, and I urge you to do so, make the time to pop into the small church by the house which has a sculptural installation made from baskets by the artist Rana Begum. It is quiet and sensitive with an inherent warmth that completely captures the spirit of Kettle's Yard.

IMO the try shouldâve been given but wouldâve been different game. Itâs NOT the reason you didnât win. England by far superior team. Welsh defence offside a lot but no complaint from England. You win some and lose some get over it !

Don't know what the referee was doing - Wales had 
their hands all over the ball at every breakdown and twice forgot he'd 
given England advantage after a knock on, then allowed the Welsh to 
affect a turnover after England lost 10 metres. Still, he helped keep it tight, and the TMO decision (poor) balanced it up! Ian Herbert:Lucky or not,England won and that's all that matters. Ireland won't be worried!!?That same Irish team that scraped past France? James in London:Very good win by England.

 build a Grand Slam from? Definitely. It's a win, same as Ireland last 
week and it was hard-earned! FT: England 12-6 Wales Eddie Jones speaking to BBC Radio 5 live: ""It was a good old-fashioned arm wrestle today but we're getting good at winning those arm wrestles.

sure. England 12-6 Wales England were sweating it in the end, but Wales' rally came too little too late.

"Haiti has never fully recovered from the 2010 earthquake that killed thousands of people Oxfam's chief executive has denied there was any cover-up after it was revealed some of its aid workers used prostitutes in Haiti in 2011. Mark Goldring said the UK-based charity was ashamed of what it had got wrong but had taken action and been proactive about going public on the matter. At the time, the charity only referred to it as ""serious misconduct"". The Department for International Development, which gave Oxfam nearly Â£32m last year, is reviewing funding. Mr Goldring toldBBC Radio 4's Today programmethe charity did ""anything but"" cover the incident up, adding: ""We were very open with the public that we were ashamed of the behaviour of our staff. We still are."" However, he said a report released by the charity did not give details of the allegations. The chief executive said: ""With hindsight, I would much prefer that we had talked about sexual misconduct. ""But I don't think it was in anyone's best interest to be describing the details of the behaviour in a way that was actually going to draw extreme attention to it when what we wanted to do was get on and deliver an aid programme."" He added: ""I am absolutely committedâ¦ to wipe out that kind of behaviour from Oxfam and rebuild that relationship of trust [with the public]."" Oxfam denies cover-up over 'Haiti prostitutes' Head of Oxfam in Haiti resigns amid inquiry Four staff members were dismissed over the revelations and three, including the country director for Haiti, were allowed to resign before the end of the charity's own investigation, it said. The director was Roland Van Hauwermeiren, whoaccording to the Times,external, used prostitutes at a villa rented for him by Oxfam. The staff had been inHaitias part of the relief effort following the devastating magnitude 7.0 earthquake that killed more than 200,000 people there in 2010. The government's review of its relationship with Oxfam comes amid fresh allegations in the paper that the charity failed to alert other aid agencies about the staff members' behaviour. Mr Van Hauwermeiren went on to work elsewhere in the sector. 'I want to break the stigma of painful sex' Pence skips Olympic meal with North Koreans French Muslim quits talent show amid row Meanwhile an Oxfam spokeswoman has said the charity would not have provided a positive reference for any of those who were dismissed or resigned. But she said: ""Unfortunately, there is nothing we can do to stop individuals falsifying references, getting others that were dismissed to act as referees and claiming it was a reference from Oxfam, or former or current Oxfam staff that worked with the individual providing a reference in a personal capacity."" In a statement on Friday, the charity said: ""The behaviour of some members of Oxfam staff uncovered in Haiti in 2011 was totally unacceptable, contrary to our values and the high standards we expect of our staff. ""Our primary aim was always to root out and take action against those involved and we publicly announced, including to media, both the investigation and the action we took as a result."" By Emma Vardy, BBC political correspondent Public confidence in the way Britain's foreign aid money is spent has been undermined by a number of scandals. DfID will now be under pressure to ensure there is zero tolerance of sexual misconduct within agencies that receive government aid funds. It is unclear to what extent DfID may have been made aware of the Oxfam incident back in 2011. Similar cases involving UN peacekeeping soldiers were brought to the attention of the then International Development Secretary Andrew Mitchell. The UK currently spends Â£13bn on aid each year and there have long been calls from some Conservative MPs for cuts to this budget. But Theresa May says she is ""proud"" of the UK's record on foreign aid and remains committed to the UK's requirement to spend 0.7% of the country's gross national income on overseas assistance. Labour, the Liberal Democrats, SNP, Greens and Plaid Cymru also agree that figure should remain. A DfID spokesman said the way ""appalling abuse of vulnerable people"" had been dealt with raised serious questions for Oxfam. He said the department acknowledged that hundreds of Oxfam staff had done nothing wrong, ""but the handling by the senior team about this investigation and their openness with us and the charity commission showed a lack of judgement"". ""We have a zero tolerance policy for the type of activity that took place in this instance, and we expect our partners to as well,"" the spokesman said. ""We often work with organisations in chaotic and difficult circumstances. If wrongdoing, abuse, fraud, or criminal activity occur we need to know about it immediately, in full.""

Dame Barbara Stocking, who was the head of Oxfam in 2011, told the BBC that the charity had a long record of having a very good code of conduct.

"Haiti became the world's first black-led republic and the first independent Caribbean state when it threw off French colonial control and slavery in the early 19th Century. But independence came at a crippling cost. It had to pay reparations to France, which demanded compensation for former slave owners. The 19th Century ""independence debt"" was not paid off until 1947. There have been recent calls for France to repay the money. Chronic instability, dictatorships and natural disasters in recent decades have left it as the poorest nation in the Americas. A 2010 earthquake killed some 300,000 people and caused extensive damage to infrastructure and the economy. A UN peacekeeping force was put in place in 2004 to help stabilize the country, and only withdrew in 2019. In 2021, President Jovenel MoÃ¯se was assassinated by unidentified gunmen in Port-au-Prince. Since then the country has been wracked by economic chaos, little functioning political control, and increasingly violent gang warfare. Read morecountry profiles,external- Profiles byBBC Monitoring,external Capital:Port-au-Prince Area:27,800 sq km Population:11.3 million Languages:French, Haitian Creole Life expectancy:62 years (men) 66 years (women) Acting Prime Minister: Michel Patrick Boisvert In April 2024, Haiti's prime minister Ariel Henry resigned and a nine-member transitional council was sworn in, with former finance minister Michel Patrick Boisvert serving as interim prime minister. Mr Boisvert said the country was at a ""crossroads"" in its search for solutions to overcome the political crisis, which was harming the population, property and infrastructure. The council was set up amid months of gang violence, the UN said more than 1,500 people had been killed and 800 injured in the first three months of 2024. Its aim is to restore order and democratic rule, and is backed by other Caribbean nations and the US. It will set the agenda of a new Cabinet, form a national security council and appoint an electoral commission to pave the way for a vote. Its mandate will expire on 7 February 2026, when a new president is expected to be sworn in. One of Haiti's most powerful gang leaders, Jimmy ChÃ©rizier, also known as Barbecue, said he would consider laying down weapons if armed groups were allowed to take part in talks to establish the new government. ChÃ©rizier is the most prominent figure in a loose alliance of gangs known as Viv Ansanm (Live Together), which controls around 80% of Port-au-Prince. He warned the crisis could continue if groups like his - which rail against ""corrupt politicians"" - were not part of a future government. Aid groups have reported difficulties in getting food and water into the capital, warning that millions are unable to find sustenance - with some on the verge of famine. Numerous local radio stations, such as this one, were destroyed in the 2010 quake Radio is Haiti's leading news medium and there are hundreds of local, privately-owned stations. The media reflect a range of views but the work of journalists is hampered by threats and violence, press watchdogs say. Read full media profile Haiti is the most populous country in the Caribbean Some key dates in Haiti's history: 1492- Christopher Columbus lands and names the island Hispaniola, or Little Spain. 1496- Spain establishes first European settlement in western hemisphere at Santo Domingo, now capital of Dominican Republic. 1697- Spain cedes western part of Hispaniola to France, and this becomes Haiti. 1801- A former black slave who became a guerrilla leader, Toussaint Louverture, conquers Haiti, abolishing slavery and proclaiming himself governor-general of an autonomous government over all Hispaniola. 1804-06- First Empire of Haiti. General Jean Jacques Dessalines proclaims the independent black republic of Haiti after rebel slaves defeat French troops dispatched by Napoleon Bonaparte. Haiti is the first nation ever to successfully gain independence through a slave revolt.

"Oxfam has worked to prevent new cases of cholera The director of Oxfam's operations in Haiti has resigned amid an inquiry into allegations of misconduct by staff. The UK-based aid agency said Roland Van Hauwermeiren felt he needed to resign as he had been in charge at the time. A small number of Oxfam workers in Haiti have been suspended, pending the outcome of an inquiry, it added. The charity raised $98m (Â£60m) for relief operations after last year's massive earthquake but Oxfam said the allegations were not linked to fraud. Oxfam has used the money to try to improve sanitation in the face of a cholera outbreak, said to have killed almost 6,000 people and made 420,000 ill. The staff suspended are not thought to be British nationals. Under Mr Van Hauwermeiren's direction, Oxfam was one of the few international aid agencies to openly criticise relief efforts. On the anniversary of the quake in January, it said in areport,externalthat ""the Haitian state, together with the international community, [was] making little progress in reconstruction"". ""Too many donors from rich countries have pursued their own aid priorities and have not effectively co-ordinated amongst themselves or worked with the Haitian government,"" Mr Van Hauwermeiren said at the time. Oxfam has been working in Haiti, the poorest country in the Americas, since 1978. Quake-hit Haiti still under rubble.

"This video can not be played Kim Yo-jong presented President Moon Jae-in with a folder holding a handwritten note from her brother, the leader of North Korea North Korea's leader Kim Jong-un has invited South Korea's President Moon Jae-in to Pyongyang. It would be the first summit in more than a decade between Korean leaders. Mr Moon said the Koreas should ""make it happen"" and encouraged the north to return to negotiations with the US. The handwritten invitation was delivered by Mr Kim's influential sister, Kim Yo-jong, at a landmark meeting in the presidential palace in Seoul, as the Winter Olympics opened. Ms Kim and the North's ceremonial head of state Kim Yong-nam made up the most senior delegation from the North to visit the South since the Korean War in the 1950s. North v South: A history of sport, bombs and diplomacy North Korea's cheerleading charm offensive The figures from the two Koreas shared kimchi (Korean pickled cabbage) and soju rice liquor, and spoke for three hours. Ms Kim invited Mr Moon to visit ""at the earliest date possible"", a spokesman for South Korea's presidential palace said. According toa tweet by the Washington Post's Tokyo bureau chief,external, Ms Kim left a note at the palace expressing hope that ""Pyongyang and Seoul will become closer in the heart of Koreans"" and for ""unification and prosperity in the near future"". The meeting comes after the US warned against engagement with Pyongyang. The Trump administration is cautious of Seoul falling for North Korea's charm offensive during the Winter Olympics, which are taking place amid tension over Pyongyang's nuclear programme. Correspondents say the invitation puts Mr Moon in a difficult position as he campaigned on a promise to engage with the North, but his moves in that direction go contrary to the wishes of his US ally Kim Yo-jong was seated near Mike Pence at the opening ceremony of the Games Earlier, US Vice-President Mike Pence briefly encountered Kim Yong-nam at the Games but the two tried to avoid directly facing each other, Yonhap news agency reports. At the opening ceremony for the Games, Mr Pence, Kim Yo-jong and Kim Yong-nam were seated in close proximity to each other. How potent are North Korea's threats? North Korea-US tension: Should you worry? Mr Pence stayed seated when the athletes of the host nation marched into the arena alongside those from the North. On Saturday,he tweeted that the US would not ""allow the propaganda charade by the North Korean regime to go unchallenged,externalon the world stage"". ""President Moon responded by saying that the two sides should work on establishing the right conditions to realise the meeting,"" the South Korean spokesman Kim Eui-kyeom said. The South Korean president requested both that North Korea re-open dialogue with the US, and that the Koreas hold talks. Mr Moon's office said the two Koreas ""shared an understanding that they should continue the positive mood for peace and recognition"" from the Olympic Games. But Pyongyang's nuclear programme will hang over any attempts to bring the countries closer together. North Korea crisis in 300 words Mr Moon has previously said he will need reassurance from the North that it would help resolve the nuclear crisis. However, analyst Robert E Kelly of Pusan National University tweeted thatthe inter-Korean relations would ""return to form"",external. Mr Moon may also, analysts said, demand a chance for families divided by the border to reunite. There have been some such meetings in the past, but they are rare. The highest profile member of the North Korean delegation to the Games, she is the first immediate member of the North's ruling family to visit the South since the 1950-1953 Korean war. Ms Kim, who is said to be very close to her brother, was promoted to the powerful politburo last year.N Korea invites South president for visit She is on a US sanctions list over alleged links to human rights abuses in North Korea. Ms Kim is thought to be about 30 years old, around four years younger than her brother.

"David Sorensen was a speechwriter who worked at the Council on Environmental Quality A speechwriter has become the second White House aide this week to resign amid allegations of domestic abuse. David Sorensen denies his former wife's allegations he was violent and emotionally abusive. His departure comes just days after another Trump official, Rob Porter, quit over allegations of abuse from two ex-wives, something he denies. Questions have been raised over how long it took the White House to act on the accusations facing Mr Porter. White House regret over abuse claims Mr Sorensen's ex-wifeJessica Corbett told the Washington Post that he was physically abusive to her while they were married,external. She said that on separate occasions her former husband ran a car over her foot, threw her against a wall and extinguished a cigarette on her hand. In response, Mr Sorensen released a statement in which he said he had ""never committed violence of any kind against any woman in my entire life"" and that instead it was he who had been physically abused. He said he was considering legal action, but said he quit because he ""didn't want the White House to have to deal with this distraction"". No longer all the president's men White House officials said they learned of the accusations by Mr Sorensen's wife late on Thursday. ""We immediately confronted the staffer, he denied the allegations and he resigned today,"" deputy press secretary Raj Shah said. Allegations of domestic abuse against Mr Porter involving two ex-wives surfaced on Tuesday. It is alleged that the former White House staff secretary gave one ex-wife a black eye while another filed a restraining order. He denies the allegations. On Friday, Mr Trump paid tribute to Mr Porter, who quit his White House position on Wednesday. This video can not be played Trump on Porter: 'We absolutely wish him well' Speaking in the Oval Office Mr Trump said: ""We found out about it recently and I was surprised by it, but we certainly wish him well and it's a tough time for him."" But Mr Trump did not refer to Mr Porter's accusers. His comments sparked criticism from Democrats, with former Vice-President Joe Biden saying Mr Trump had downplayed the allegations against Mr Porter. ""That's like saying: 'That axe murderer out there, he's a great painter'"", Mr Biden said. The case has put pressure on Mr Trump's Chief-of-Staff John Kelly, who has denied reports he offered to resign over his handling of the accusations. After initially praising Mr Porter as a man of ""integrity"", Mr Kelly later released a statement saying he was shocked by the claims and stressed domestic violence was unacceptable. US media report that Mr Kelly and other White House officials were aware for several months of the domestic abuse accusations because they were holding up Mr Porter's security clearance application. Mr Shah said that Mr Trump was not aware of any security issues before Tuesday and was ""disheartened"" and ""saddened"" by the accusations. White House communications director Hope Hicks' (C) handling of the controversy has reportedly displeased Mr Trump White House communications director Hope Hicks' handling of the controversy has also reportedly displeased Mr Trump. The 29-year-old aide has recently been in a relationship with Mr Porter, a Harvard graduate and former Oxford Rhodes Scholar. Mr Trump was reportedly not consulted when Ms Hicks helped draft an initial statement defending Mr Porter. According to CBS News, Mr Porter approached White House Counsel Don McGahn in January 2017 to inform him his ex-wives might say unflattering things about him to background check investigators. In June 2017, Mr Porter's preliminary file was sent from the FBI to the White House security office, containing the abuse allegations. In November, Mr McGahn received a call from an ex-girlfriend of Mr Porter alleging physical violence by the aide. Mr McGahn told the White House chief of staff there was an issue with Mr Porter's security clearance, although he was vague, reports CBS. Mr Porter told Mr Kelly his ex-wives were saying false things about him. A White House spokesman said on Thursday that Mr Kelly did not realise the extent of the claims until a photo of one of Mr Porter's former wives, Colbie Holderness, suffering a black eye, emerged on Wednesday.

"This video can not be played Mary Lou McDonald succeeds Gerry Adams as Sinn FÃ©in leader Mary Lou McDonald has been formally elected as leader of Sinn FÃ©in, replacing Gerry Adams who led the party for almost 35 years. Mr Adams, 69,announced his intention to quit the role in Novemberin a move that signalled a generational shift in the Sinn FÃ©in leadership. Ms McDonald, 48, said she was ""humbled"" to lead ""Ireland's oldest and greatest political party"". Michelle O'Neill, 41, has also been installed as Sinn FÃ©in vice president. The elections took place at a special ard fhÃ©is (party conference) in Dublin. McDonald set to be new Sinn FÃ©in president 'Marmite' Mary Lou McDonald O'Neill set to become new Sinn FÃ©in VP Mary Lou McDonald and Michelle O'Neill at their party conference in Dublin Ms McDonald paid tribute to Mr Adams, saying there would have been no peace process and no Good Friday Agreement without him. She described him as her political mentor, an ""inspirational"" leader and a ""great friend"". In her first speech as leader, she warned that Brexit represents a real threat to the prosperity and political life of Ireland. ""There can be no imposition of a border on the island of Ireland, that message must go loud and clear from our ard fhÃ©is today.  Ireland will not be the collateral damage in the political games and antics of the Tories in London."" Mary Lou McDonald described Gerry Adams as her mentor and friend Turning to the talks at Stormont, she pledged that her party was up for a deal. ""The Sinn FÃ©in team is committed to a positive outcome.  As UachtarÃ¡n Shinn FÃ©in (Sinn FÃ©in leader) I look forward to working with the DUP and with the other parties in the north."" Michelle O'Neill told the ard fhÃ©is that she expected the talks to restore devolution at Stormont to conclude next week. ""I believe that the issues which caused the collapse of Stormont can be resolved with political will and mutual respect,"" she said. ""Issues like marriage equality, an Irish language act, legacy inquests, rights, respect and integrity in government should not be politically contentious. Michelle O'Neill and Mary Lou McDonald at the ard fhÃ©is in Dublin ""A restored executive with genuine power-sharing at its heart and acting in the interests of all people."" Mrs O'Neill said it was vital to heal the pain of the past. ""Part of reconciliation involves recognising everyone's right to remember their dead,"" she said. ""But what's required is a unionist partner to help lead this crucial effort together."" Gerry Adams pictured in the audience at the ard fhÃ©is Mrs O'Neill called for a referendum on a united Ireland. ""We must face outwards and listen to those who don't want a united Ireland,"" she said. ""It is our task to persuade those people, sectors and communities of why it's in their best economic and political interests to share power across this island."" Saturday's elections were a formality as both women ran unopposed for the leadership roles. Mr Adams is one of the most prominent and controversial Irish politicians and his political legacy will divide opinion sharply. This video can not be played Gerry Adams: In his own words Speaking on Friday night, he said he was ""confident"" that the new leadership would ""help make Sinn FÃ©in even bigger and stronger in the time ahead"". ""Fifty years ago when I joined Sinn FÃ©in, it was a banned party,"" he said. Gerry Adams with Michelle O'Neill and Mary Lou McDonald ""The nationalist people of the north had been abandoned and were subject to discrimination and inequality. We were on our knees. We are now off our knees. ""We have a Good Friday Agreement. It is in some difficulty at this time. But it offers the way forward."" The leadership change comes almost 20 years after the 1998 Good Friday Agreement, but it also comes at a time of great political uncertainty. Northern Ireland has been without a devolved government sinceMartin McGuiness quit as deputy first minister in January 2017, in a move which caused the assembly to collapse. Gerry Adams pictured leaving Stormont on his last night as leader of Sinn FÃ©in He pulled Sinn FÃ©in out of its power-sharing coalition with the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), objecting to their handling ofa scandal over green energy scheme. Several rounds of talks aimed at restoring devolution have failed, but there is nowgrowing speculation that a deal could be unveiled as early as next week. Ms McDonald and Mrs O'Neill have been present all week at talks in Stormont which have been described as a last ditch attempt to restore power-sharing.

Mary Lou McDonald (left) and Michelle O'Neill ran unopposed for their new roles Sinn FÃ©in sources have said that the talks are at a crucial stage. They are taking place against the complicated backdrop of Brexit and the way it impinges on economic and political matters, both in Anglo-Irish relations and in cross-border co-operation. As Mr Adams left the Stormont talks on Friday night - for the last time as Sinn FÃ©in leader - he said: ""It isn't sorted out as we speak.

"British fighters Alexanda Kotey (left) and El Shafee Elsheikh were captured by Syrian Kurdish forces Two captured British fighters should be tried in an international criminal court, rather than sent to Guantanamo Bay, a defence minister has said. Tobias Ellwood told two newspapers it was important that ""terrorists from any origin are transparently and fairly held account for their actions"". The fighters, Alexanda Kotey and El Shafee Elsheikh, were captured by Syrian Kurdish forces in Syria. The BBC understands the pair have been stripped of their UK citizenship. Where should the IS 'Beatles' be tried? They were the last two of four UK IS members known as""the Beatles"", so called because of their British accents. The cell became infamous for its high-profile executions of Western hostages. The Syrian fighters who captured them say they are yet to receive a request from any country to hand them over. It has been suggested they could be sent to the US military prison at Guantanamo Bay. Alternatively, they could be put on criminal trial in the US or at the International Criminal Court, The Hague, which can prosecute people for genocide, war crimes, crimes against humanity and aggression. Mr Ellwood, who lost his brother in a terrorist attack in Bali in 2002 and who himselfwas caught up in the Westminster attacklast year, said Kotey and Elsheikh should be tried at The Hague. Mr Ellwood demanded ""an agreed international process"" for captured fighters, in interviews withThe Times,externaland theDaily Telegraph,external. ""Guantanamo Bay created a new combatant status that bypassed the Geneva convention, used torture and failed to address a wider global jihadist insurgency that continues today,"" he said.

"Labour's proposal to bring services such as water, energy and rail into public ownership would be ""cost free"", John McDonnell has said. The shadow chancellor says he wants to put public services ""irreversibly in the hands of workers"" so they can ""never again be taken away"". In a speech in London, Mr McDonnell said privatisation had failed. However, the Conservatives said his plan would cost taxpayers billions of pounds and lead to worse services. Earlier, Mr McDonnell told BBC Radio 4's Today programme taking services into public ownership would not ultimately increase the burden on taxpayers because government bonds could be swapped for shares in a revenue-producing company. ""It would be cost free. You borrow to buy an asset and when that asset is producing profits like the water industry does, that will cover your borrowing cost,"" he said. A report earlier this week by the Social Market Foundation, commissioned by a group of water companies, estimated thatthe up-front costs of renationalisation would be Â£90bn,external. 'I want to break the stigma of painful sex' Pence skips Olympic meal with North Koreans French Muslim quits talent show amid row But Mr McDonnell said utilities could be managed more efficiently under public ownership, because they would no longer have to fund dividends for shareholders. ""They've given out Â£18bn of dividends to their shareholders - sometimes they've actually given out more in dividends than they've made in profits,"" he told the BBC. In his speech to Labour's Alternative Models of Ownership conference, Mr McDonnell said the best way to protect public services for the long term was for them to be owned by the public. This video can not be played Labour to help local councils bring public services in-house He said: ""The next Labour government will put democratically owned and managed public services irreversibly in the hands of workers and of those who rely on their work."" Public services could be made more responsive and effective by bringing together the people who use them, workers and expert managers, the shadow chancellor said. He said: ""We aren't going to take back control of these industries in order to put them into the hands of a remote bureaucracy, but to put them into the hands of all of you - so that they can never again be taken away. ""Public ownership is not just a political decision, it's an economic necessity. ""We'll move away from the failed privatisation model of the past, developing new democratic forms of ownership, joining other countries, regions and cities across the world in taking control of our essential services."" by Joe Lynam, BBC business correspondent It's not unusual for private companies in trouble to do a ""debt for equity swap"". To save the business, those investors who own shares (equity) lose everything, and those investors who own the company's less risky bonds (debt) get those shares. Swapping government debt for private company shares is unusual though. In theory, the Treasury could issue new government bonds - known as gilts - and hand them over to the private owners of water or electricity companies. That would then make taxpayers shareholders in the utility in question. But all the existing contracts would continue in force. So salaries and bonuses would have to be honoured, as would contracts with all other private sector suppliers. The new owners (taxpayers) would also need to retain experienced staff to do often very specialised work. If those skilled staff thought they'd earn more in the private sector, that may be an issue. Treasury Chief Secretary Liz Truss said: ""Labour would put politicians in charge of running everything from the phone lines to electricity supply, meaning people have nowhere to turn when things go wrong. That didn't work last time and won't work this time."" And UK business group the CBI said Labour's calls for nationalisation would ""wind the clock back on our economy"". Its managing director for people and infrastructure Neil Carberry said: ""If Labour turns its back on good collaboration between the government and the private sector, public services, infrastructure and taxpayers will ultimately pay the price."" In the speech, Mr McDonnell also announced the creation of a working group to look at how co-operatives can grow, expand and access funding, including the possibility of giving employees a greater right to own shares in the company they work for.

"The Israeli F-16 jet crashed near a village in northern Israel An Israeli F-16 fighter jet has crashed after being hit by Syrian air defences during an offensive in Syria, the Israeli military says. The two pilots parachuted to safety before the crash in northern Israel. It is believed to be the first time Israel has lost a jet in the Syrian conflict. The plane was hit during air strikes in response to an Iranian drone launch into Israeli territory, Israel says. The drone was shot down. Israel later launched further strikes in Syria. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) say they hit aerial defence batteries and Iranian military sites in the latest strikes. Israeli air strikes in Syria are not unusual, the BBC's Middle East correspondent Tom Bateman says, but the loss of an Israeli fighter jet marks a serious escalation. Israel 'strikes Damascus military complex' Why is there a war in Syria? In other developments in the Syrian conflict on Saturday: A Turkish helicopter was shot down as the country continued its offensive against Kurdish fighters in northern Syria. Two soldiers on board were killed, the Turkish military says UN Human Rights Commissioner Zeid Ra'ad al-Hussein said the past week was one of the bloodiest in Syria since the conflict began in 2011 - with at least 277 civilian deaths reported The Israeli military says a ""combat helicopter successfully intercepted an Iranian UAV [unmanned aerial vehicle] that was launched from Syria and infiltrated Israel"". It tweeted footage which it says shows the drone flying into Israeli territory before being hit. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

In a further response, the IDF ""targeted Iranian targets in Syria"", according to the military. The mission deep inside Syrian territory was successfully completed, it said. After coming under Syrian anti-aircraft fire, the F-16's two crew members ejected and were later taken to hospital. One of them was ""severely injured as a result of an emergency evacuation"", the IDF said. It is the first time Israel has lost an aircraft in combat since 2006,externalwhen an Israeli helicopter was shot down over Lebanon by a Hezbollah rocket, the Jerusalem Post reports. All five crew on board - including a female flight mechanic - were killed in that incident. Anti-aircraft fire smoke over the Syrian-Israeli border in the Golan Heights Alert sirens sounded in areas of northern Israel and the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights because of Syrian anti-aircraft fire. Residents reported hearing a number of explosions and heavy aerial activity in the area near Israel's borders with Jordan and Syria. The fighter jet was carrying out strikes on Iranian targets in Syria, the Israelis say (file picture) Syrian state media quoted a military source as saying that the country's air defences had opened fire in response to Israeli ""aggression"" against a military base on Saturday, hitting ""more than one plane"". Israel launched its second wave of strikes in Syria. Eight of the Syrian targets belonged to the fourth Syrian division near Damascus, IDF spokesman Jonathan Conricus said. All the Israeli aircraft from this sortie returned safely. ""Syrians are playing with fire when they allow Iranians to attack Israel,"" the spokesman warned. He added that Israel was willing to exact a heavy price in response but was ""are not looking to escalate the situation"". Meanwhile Iran and the Tehran-backed Hezbollah movement in Lebanon - which are allied with the Syrian government - dismissed reports that an Iranian drone had entered Israeli airspace as a ""lie"". Russia expressed ""serious concern"" over the Israeli air strikes and called for all sides to show restraint. Iran is Israel's arch-enemy, and Iranian troops have been fighting rebel groups since 2011. Tehran has sent military advisers, volunteer militias and, reportedly, hundreds of fighters from its Quds Force, the overseas arm of the Iranian Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC). It is also believed to have supplied thousands of tonnes of weaponry and munitions to help President Bashar al-Assad's forces and the pro-Iranian Hezbollah, which is fighting on Syria's side. Tehran has faced accusations that it is seeking to establish not just an arc of influence but a logistical land supply line from Iran through to Hezbollah in Lebanon. Analysis by BBC's diplomatic correspondent Jonathan Marcus For years Israel has been striking at weapons stores and other facilities in Syria with a single goal - to disrupt and, as far as possible, to prevent advanced Iranian missiles being delivered to Hezbollah in Lebanon. Syria has often been the conduit for these shipments, but the changing balance of power there, with the Assad regime's survival bolstered by Iranian help, has introduced a powerful new element - a direct Iranian role in the crisis. A more confident Iran is alleged by Israel to be setting up bases in Syria(whether for its own or its proxy Shia Muslim militia forces is unclear). But it is also alleged to be developing missile factories, both there and in Lebanon, to make the supply lines to Hezbollah less vulnerable. Israel's campaign to disrupt missile supplies is becoming ever more complex. And Iran risks becoming a direct actor in this conflict, ever closer to Israel's own borders.

"Haiti has never fully recovered from the 2010 earthquake that killed thousands of people Oxfam's chief executive has denied there was any cover-up after it was revealed some of its aid workers used prostitutes in Haiti in 2011. Mark Goldring said the UK-based charity was ashamed of what it had got wrong but had taken action and been proactive about going public on the matter. At the time, the charity only referred to it as ""serious misconduct"". The Department for International Development, which gave Oxfam nearly Â£32m last year, is reviewing funding. Mr Goldring toldBBC Radio 4's Today programmethe charity did ""anything but"" cover the incident up, adding: ""We were very open with the public that we were ashamed of the behaviour of our staff. We still are."" However, he said a report released by the charity did not give details of the allegations. The chief executive said: ""With hindsight, I would much prefer that we had talked about sexual misconduct. ""But I don't think it was in anyone's best interest to be describing the details of the behaviour in a way that was actually going to draw extreme attention to it when what we wanted to do was get on and deliver an aid programme."" He added: ""I am absolutely committedâ¦ to wipe out that kind of behaviour from Oxfam and rebuild that relationship of trust [with the public]."" Oxfam denies cover-up over 'Haiti prostitutes' Head of Oxfam in Haiti resigns amid inquiry Four staff members were dismissed over the revelations and three, including the country director for Haiti, were allowed to resign before the end of the charity's own investigation, it said. The director was Roland Van Hauwermeiren, whoaccording to the Times,external, used prostitutes at a villa rented for him by Oxfam. The staff had been inHaitias part of the relief effort following the devastating magnitude 7.0 earthquake that killed more than 200,000 people there in 2010. The government's review of its relationship with Oxfam comes amid fresh allegations in the paper that the charity failed to alert other aid agencies about the staff members' behaviour. Mr Van Hauwermeiren went on to work elsewhere in the sector. 'I want to break the stigma of painful sex' Pence skips Olympic meal with North Koreans French Muslim quits talent show amid row Meanwhile an Oxfam spokeswoman has said the charity would not have provided a positive reference for any of those who were dismissed or resigned. But she said: ""Unfortunately, there is nothing we can do to stop individuals falsifying references, getting others that were dismissed to act as referees and claiming it was a reference from Oxfam, or former or current Oxfam staff that worked with the individual providing a reference in a personal capacity."" In a statement on Friday, the charity said: ""The behaviour of some members of Oxfam staff uncovered in Haiti in 2011 was totally unacceptable, contrary to our values and the high standards we expect of our staff. ""Our primary aim was always to root out and take action against those involved and we publicly announced, including to media, both the investigation and the action we took as a result."" By Emma Vardy, BBC political correspondent Public confidence in the way Britain's foreign aid money is spent has been undermined by a number of scandals. DfID will now be under pressure to ensure there is zero tolerance of sexual misconduct within agencies that receive government aid funds. It is unclear to what extent DfID may have been made aware of the Oxfam incident back in 2011. Similar cases involving UN peacekeeping soldiers were brought to the attention of the then International Development Secretary Andrew Mitchell. The UK currently spends Â£13bn on aid each year and there have long been calls from some Conservative MPs for cuts to this budget. But Theresa May says she is ""proud"" of the UK's record on foreign aid and remains committed to the UK's requirement to spend 0.7% of the country's gross national income on overseas assistance. Labour, the Liberal Democrats, SNP, Greens and Plaid Cymru also agree that figure should remain. A DfID spokesman said the way ""appalling abuse of vulnerable people"" had been dealt with raised serious questions for Oxfam. He said the department acknowledged that hundreds of Oxfam staff had done nothing wrong, ""but the handling by the senior team about this investigation and their openness with us and the charity commission showed a lack of judgement"". ""We have a zero tolerance policy for the type of activity that took place in this instance, and we expect our partners to as well,"" the spokesman said. ""We often work with organisations in chaotic and difficult circumstances. If wrongdoing, abuse, fraud, or criminal activity occur we need to know about it immediately, in full."" International Development Secretary Penny Mordaunt had requested a meeting with Oxfam's senior team ""at the earliest opportunity"", the spokesman said. This video can not be played Andrew Mitchell 'can't be sure' he knew about the Oxfam case Andrew Mitchell, who was international development secretary in 2011, told BBC's Newsnight it was a ""shudderingly awful tale"" that was ""terrible on every single level"". But he said he could not recall being told about the incident. Dame Barbara Stocking, who was the head of Oxfam in 2011, told the BBC that the charity had a long record of having a very good code of conduct. When it happened, she said, new whistle-blowing procedures, safeguarding practises and training were put in place. She said Oxfam often worked in very difficult locations ""where the rule of law isn't going on"".

"If I had Elon Musk-type money, I would hire a top-notch art gallery curator to clean my house. I would happily be the assistant, undertaking the most menial tasks while the duster-wielding curator concentrated on doing what curators do better than anyone else in the world, which is to arrange things really nicely. Making the shabby chic, transforming a total mess into a harmonious, tonal, soul-calming, eye-pleasing composition is the curator's art. It is a form of alchemy that is genuinely a wonder to behold. You will know this if you've ever been to Kettle's Yard in Cambridge, the former home of one-time Tate Gallery curator Jim Ede and his wife Helen. Jim Ede bought Kettle's Yard in the 1950s From the leather roundel you pull to gain entry, to the Brancusi sculpture of a reclining head placed casually on the lid of a grand piano, every inch, every sightline, has been meticulously considered and intricately planned to deliver the ultimate aesthetic experience. Prometheus by Brancusi Jim gave as much curatorial care and attention to arranging the pebbles he picked up on the beach as he did to his splendid collection of modernist art. Everything mattered. For instance, in the front room there is a small Joan Miro surrealist painting hanging above a spiralled, totemic wooden cider press, to the side of which is a large pewter plate. On that plate is a single fresh lemon, placed on the outer rim and positioned at precisely nine o'clock. Why? Because the fruit's bright yellowness accentuates the solemn greyness of the pewter while also echoing the small lemon shape in Miro's painting, which is at about three o'clock in the picture. As far as the Edes were concerned, the devil wasn't in the detail, beauty was. Tic Tic (1927) by Joan Miro There are hundreds of similar curatorial touches to enjoy as you make your way around the house, which was once four small slum cottages before Jim and Helen bought and renovated them into one dwelling in 1957. Their attention to detail didn't stop at the objects, or even the display thereof; it encompassed the entire experience, most particularly how light affects everything we see and sense. Their idea was to keep ""open house"" every afternoon of the academic term for students and anyone else so inclined to visit ""a living place where works of art could be enjoyed, inherent to the domestic"". It was ""in no way meant to be an art gallery or museum"". That was in the late 50s. In 1966, while still living at Kettle's Yard, the Edes gave the house, its contents, and the majority of their art collection to the University of Cambridge. Before long, the initial trickle of one or two interested students a day had turned into mass of tens, then hundreds, and eventually many thousands of visitors a year. A sympathetic, Le Corbusier-inspired extension was built in 1970 by Sir Leslie Martin and David Owers to accommodate the ever-expanding number of artworks, artefacts and art lovers. The Edes left in 1973 to live in peace and quiet in Scotland. Since then, Kettle's Yard has continued to develop in a slightly haphazard fashion, until the decision was made a few years ago to employ Jamie Fobert (the go-to art world architect for sensitive design projects) to bring some order to the site by creating a new suite of galleries, education spaces, and offices. On Saturday, they open to the public, who will be the first beneficiaries of a proper reception area, cafe and shop. Kettleâs Yard is reopening after an Â£11.3 million redevelopment by architect Jamie Fobert The new galleries are fine, and they have some nice touches, and I'm sure lots of modern art will look good in them. But I have to admit to being just a little bit disappointed by the rather hackneyed combination of concrete floor, smooth white wall and double-height ceiling. Such spaces are two-a-penny nowadays. They are like Prada stores and Range Rovers, classy but now irritatingly ubiquitous; chilly corporate spaces beloved by big-shot art dealers and major modern art museums. They struck me to be at odds with the Edes' founding principle of seeing art in a domestic setting. It's probably my fault for being a hopeless romantic, and I'm sure I'll enjoy many exhibitions held in them over the coming years (the inaugural show, Actions. The Image of the World Can Be Different feels like a limbering up exercise), but I can't help wondering if they are an opportunity missed. The Edes' taste was for mottled walls, light timber, and local brick. Domestic materials. I didn't detect an obvious love for polished concrete or austere environments. But this is only a small gripe about one of the great oases of culture in an increasingly vulgar world. The updating of Kettle's Yard was necessary and it has been done lovingly and thoughtfully by a team who care passionately about it - and us. Rana Begum's installation of bamboo baskets, No. 764 Baskets at St Peter's Church, Cambridge When you go, and I urge you to do so, make the time to pop into the small church by the house which has a sculptural installation made from baskets by the artist Rana Begum. It is quiet and sensitive with an inherent warmth that completely captures the spirit of Kettle's Yard.

"This video can not be played Kim Yo-jong presented President Moon Jae-in with a folder holding a handwritten note from her brother, the leader of North Korea North Korea's leader Kim Jong-un has invited South Korea's President Moon Jae-in to Pyongyang. It would be the first summit in more than a decade between Korean leaders. Mr Moon said the Koreas should ""make it happen"" and encouraged the north to return to negotiations with the US. The handwritten invitation was delivered by Mr Kim's influential sister, Kim Yo-jong, at a landmark meeting in the presidential palace in Seoul, as the Winter Olympics opened. Ms Kim and the North's ceremonial head of state Kim Yong-nam made up the most senior delegation from the North to visit the South since the Korean War in the 1950s. North v South: A history of sport, bombs and diplomacy North Korea's cheerleading charm offensive The figures from the two Koreas shared kimchi (Korean pickled cabbage) and soju rice liquor, and spoke for three hours. Ms Kim invited Mr Moon to visit ""at the earliest date possible"", a spokesman for South Korea's presidential palace said. According toa tweet by the Washington Post's Tokyo bureau chief,external, Ms Kim left a note at the palace expressing hope that ""Pyongyang and Seoul will become closer in the heart of Koreans"" and for ""unification and prosperity in the near future"". The meeting comes after the US warned against engagement with Pyongyang. The Trump administration is cautious of Seoul falling for North Korea's charm offensive during the Winter Olympics, which are taking place amid tension over Pyongyang's nuclear programme. Correspondents say the invitation puts Mr Moon in a difficult position as he campaigned on a promise to engage with the North, but his moves in that direction go contrary to the wishes of his US ally Kim Yo-jong was seated near Mike Pence at the opening ceremony of the Games Earlier, US Vice-President Mike Pence briefly encountered Kim Yong-nam at the Games but the two tried to avoid directly facing each other, Yonhap news agency reports. At the opening ceremony for the Games, Mr Pence, Kim Yo-jong and Kim Yong-nam were seated in close proximity to each other. How potent are North Korea's threats? North Korea-US tension: Should you worry? Mr Pence stayed seated when the athletes of the host nation marched into the arena alongside those from the North. On Saturday,he tweeted that the US would not ""allow the propaganda charade by the North Korean regime to go unchallenged,externalon the world stage"". ""President Moon responded by saying that the two sides should work on establishing the right conditions to realise the meeting,"" the South Korean spokesman Kim Eui-kyeom said. The South Korean president requested both that North Korea re-open dialogue with the US, and that the Koreas hold talks. Mr Moon's office said the two Koreas ""shared an understanding that they should continue the positive mood for peace and recognition"" from the Olympic Games. But Pyongyang's nuclear programme will hang over any attempts to bring the countries closer together. North Korea crisis in 300 words Mr Moon has previously said he will need reassurance from the North that it would help resolve the nuclear crisis. However, analyst Robert E Kelly of Pusan National University tweeted thatthe inter-Korean relations would ""return to form"",external. Mr Moon may also, analysts said, demand a chance for families divided by the border to reunite. There have been some such meetings in the past, but they are rare. The highest profile member of the North Korean delegation to the Games, she is the first immediate member of the North's ruling family to visit the South since the 1950-1953 Korean war. Ms Kim, who is said to be very close to her brother, was promoted to the powerful politburo last year.N Korea invites South president for visit She is on a US sanctions list over alleged links to human rights abuses in North Korea. Ms Kim is thought to be about 30 years old, around four years younger than her brother.

"The Israeli F-16 jet crashed near a village in northern Israel An Israeli F-16 fighter jet has crashed after being hit by Syrian air defences during an offensive in Syria, the Israeli military says. The two pilots parachuted to safety before the crash in northern Israel. It is believed to be the first time Israel has lost a jet in the Syrian conflict. The plane was hit during air strikes in response to an Iranian drone launch into Israeli territory, Israel says. The drone was shot down. Israel later launched further strikes in Syria. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) say they hit aerial defence batteries and Iranian military sites in the latest strikes. Israeli air strikes in Syria are not unusual, the BBC's Middle East correspondent Tom Bateman says, but the loss of an Israeli fighter jet marks a serious escalation. Israel 'strikes Damascus military complex' Why is there a war in Syria? In other developments in the Syrian conflict on Saturday: A Turkish helicopter was shot down as the country continued its offensive against Kurdish fighters in northern Syria. Two soldiers on board were killed, the Turkish military says UN Human Rights Commissioner Zeid Ra'ad al-Hussein said the past week was one of the bloodiest in Syria since the conflict began in 2011 - with at least 277 civilian deaths reported The Israeli military says a ""combat helicopter successfully intercepted an Iranian UAV [unmanned aerial vehicle] that was launched from Syria and infiltrated Israel"".

In a further response, the IDF ""targeted Iranian targets in Syria"", according to the military. The mission deep inside Syrian territory was successfully completed, it said. After coming under Syrian anti-aircraft fire, the F-16's two crew members ejected and were later taken to hospital. One of them was ""severely injured as a result of an emergency evacuation"", the IDF said. It is the first time Israel has lost an aircraft in combat since 2006,externalwhen an Israeli helicopter was shot down over Lebanon by a Hezbollah rocket, the Jerusalem Post reports. All five crew on board - including a female flight mechanic - were killed in that incident. Anti-aircraft fire smoke over the Syrian-Israeli border in the Golan Heights Alert sirens sounded in areas of northern Israel and the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights because of Syrian anti-aircraft fire. Residents reported hearing a number of explosions and heavy aerial activity in the area near Israel's borders with Jordan and Syria. The fighter jet was carrying out strikes on Iranian targets in Syria, the Israelis say (file picture) Syrian state media quoted a military source as saying that the country's air defences had opened fire in response to Israeli ""aggression"" against a military base on Saturday, hitting ""more than one plane"". Israel launched its second wave of strikes in Syria. Eight of the Syrian targets belonged to the fourth Syrian division near Damascus, IDF spokesman Jonathan Conricus said. All the Israeli aircraft from this sortie returned safely. ""Syrians are playing with fire when they allow Iranians to attack Israel,"" the spokesman warned. He added that Israel was willing to exact a heavy price in response but was ""are not looking to escalate the situation"". Meanwhile Iran and the Tehran-backed Hezbollah movement in Lebanon - which are allied with the Syrian government - dismissed reports that an Iranian drone had entered Israeli airspace as a ""lie"". Russia expressed ""serious concern"" over the Israeli air strikes and called for all sides to show restraint. Iran is Israel's arch-enemy, and Iranian troops have been fighting rebel groups since 2011. Tehran has sent military advisers, volunteer militias and, reportedly, hundreds of fighters from its Quds Force, the overseas arm of the Iranian Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC). It is also believed to have supplied thousands of tonnes of weaponry and munitions to help President Bashar al-Assad's forces and the pro-Iranian Hezbollah, which is fighting on Syria's side. Tehran has faced accusations that it is seeking to establish not just an arc of influence but a logistical land supply line from Iran through to Hezbollah in Lebanon. Analysis by BBC's diplomatic correspondent Jonathan Marcus For years Israel has been striking at weapons stores and other facilities in Syria with a single goal - to disrupt and, as far as possible, to prevent advanced Iranian missiles being delivered to Hezbollah in Lebanon. Syria has often been the conduit for these shipments, but the changing balance of power there, with the Assad regime's survival bolstered by Iranian help, has introduced a powerful new element - a direct Iranian role in the crisis. A more confident Iran is alleged by Israel to be setting up bases in Syria(whether for its own or its proxy Shia Muslim militia forces is unclear). But it is also alleged to be developing missile factories, both there and in Lebanon, to make the supply lines to Hezbollah less vulnerable. Israel's campaign to disrupt missile supplies is becoming ever more complex. And Iran risks becoming a direct actor in this conflict, ever closer to Israel's own borders.

In a further response, the IDF ""targeted Iranian targets in Syria"", according to the military. The mission deep inside Syrian territory was successfully completed, it said. After coming under Syrian anti-aircraft fire, the F-16's two crew members ejected and were later taken to hospital. One of them was ""severely injured as a result of an emergency evacuation"", the IDF said. It is the first time Israel has lost an aircraft in combat since 2006,externalwhen an Israeli helicopter was shot down over Lebanon by a Hezbollah rocket, the Jerusalem Post reports. All five crew on board - including a female flight mechanic - were killed in that incident. Anti-aircraft fire smoke over the Syrian-Israeli border in the Golan Heights Alert sirens sounded in areas of northern Israel and the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights because of Syrian anti-aircraft fire. Residents reported hearing a number of explosions and heavy aerial activity in the area near Israel's borders with Jordan and Syria. The fighter jet was carrying out strikes on Iranian targets in Syria, the Israelis say (file picture) Syrian state media quoted a military source as saying that the country's air defences had opened fire in response to Israeli ""aggression"" against a military base on Saturday, hitting ""more than one plane"". Israel launched its second wave of strikes in Syria. Eight of the Syrian targets belonged to the fourth Syrian division near Damascus, IDF spokesman Jonathan Conricus said. All the Israeli aircraft from this sortie returned safely. ""Syrians are playing with fire when they allow Iranians to attack Israel,"" the spokesman warned. He added that Israel was willing to exact a heavy price in response but was ""are not looking to escalate the situation"". Meanwhile Iran and the Tehran-backed Hezbollah movement in Lebanon - which are allied with the Syrian government - dismissed reports that an Iranian drone had entered Israeli airspace as a ""lie"". Russia expressed ""serious concern"" over the Israeli air strikes and called for all sides to show restraint. Iran is Israel's arch-enemy, and Iranian troops have been fighting rebel groups since 2011. Tehran has sent military advisers, volunteer militias and, reportedly, hundreds of fighters from its Quds Force, the overseas arm of the Iranian Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC). It is also believed to have supplied thousands of tonnes of weaponry and munitions to help President Bashar al-Assad's forces and the pro-Iranian Hezbollah, which is fighting on Syria's side. Tehran has faced accusations that it is seeking to establish not just an arc of influence but a logistical land supply line from Iran through to Hezbollah in Lebanon. Analysis by BBC's diplomatic correspondent Jonathan Marcus For years Israel has been striking at weapons stores and other facilities in Syria with a single goal - to disrupt and, as far as possible, to prevent advanced Iranian missiles being delivered to Hezbollah in Lebanon. Syria has often been the conduit for these shipments, but the changing balance of power there, with the Assad regime's survival bolstered by Iranian help, has introduced a powerful new element - a direct Iranian role in the crisis. A more confident Iran is alleged by Israel to be setting up bases in Syria(whether for its own or its proxy Shia Muslim militia forces is unclear). But it is also alleged to be developing missile factories, both there and in Lebanon, to make the supply lines to Hezbollah less vulnerable. Israel's campaign to disrupt missile supplies is becoming ever more complex. And Iran risks becoming a direct actor in this conflict, ever closer to Israel's own borders.

"If I had Elon Musk-type money, I would hire a top-notch art gallery curator to clean my house. I would happily be the assistant, undertaking the most menial tasks while the duster-wielding curator concentrated on doing what curators do better than anyone else in the world, which is to arrange things really nicely. Making the shabby chic, transforming a total mess into a harmonious, tonal, soul-calming, eye-pleasing composition is the curator's art. It is a form of alchemy that is genuinely a wonder to behold. You will know this if you've ever been to Kettle's Yard in Cambridge, the former home of one-time Tate Gallery curator Jim Ede and his wife Helen. Jim Ede bought Kettle's Yard in the 1950s From the leather roundel you pull to gain entry, to the Brancusi sculpture of a reclining head placed casually on the lid of a grand piano, every inch, every sightline, has been meticulously considered and intricately planned to deliver the ultimate aesthetic experience. Prometheus by Brancusi Jim gave as much curatorial care and attention to arranging the pebbles he picked up on the beach as he did to his splendid collection of modernist art. Everything mattered. For instance, in the front room there is a small Joan Miro surrealist painting hanging above a spiralled, totemic wooden cider press, to the side of which is a large pewter plate. On that plate is a single fresh lemon, placed on the outer rim and positioned at precisely nine o'clock. Why? Because the fruit's bright yellowness accentuates the solemn greyness of the pewter while also echoing the small lemon shape in Miro's painting, which is at about three o'clock in the picture. As far as the Edes were concerned, the devil wasn't in the detail, beauty was. Tic Tic (1927) by Joan Miro There are hundreds of similar curatorial touches to enjoy as you make your way around the house, which was once four small slum cottages before Jim and Helen bought and renovated them into one dwelling in 1957. Their attention to detail didn't stop at the objects, or even the display thereof; it encompassed the entire experience, most particularly how light affects everything we see and sense. Their idea was to keep ""open house"" every afternoon of the academic term for students and anyone else so inclined to visit ""a living place where works of art could be enjoyed, inherent to the domestic"". It was ""in no way meant to be an art gallery or museum"". That was in the late 50s. In 1966, while still living at Kettle's Yard, the Edes gave the house, its contents, and the majority of their art collection to the University of Cambridge. Before long, the initial trickle of one or two interested students a day had turned into mass of tens, then hundreds, and eventually many thousands of visitors a year. A sympathetic, Le Corbusier-inspired extension was built in 1970 by Sir Leslie Martin and David Owers to accommodate the ever-expanding number of artworks, artefacts and art lovers. The Edes left in 1973 to live in peace and quiet in Scotland. Since then, Kettle's Yard has continued to develop in a slightly haphazard fashion, until the decision was made a few years ago to employ Jamie Fobert (the go-to art world architect for sensitive design projects) to bring some order to the site by creating a new suite of galleries, education spaces, and offices. On Saturday, they open to the public, who will be the first beneficiaries of a proper reception area, cafe and shop. Kettleâs Yard is reopening after an Â£11.3 million redevelopment by architect Jamie Fobert The new galleries are fine, and they have some nice touches, and I'm sure lots of modern art will look good in them. But I have to admit to being just a little bit disappointed by the rather hackneyed combination of concrete floor, smooth white wall and double-height ceiling. Such spaces are two-a-penny nowadays. They are like Prada stores and Range Rovers, classy but now irritatingly ubiquitous; chilly corporate spaces beloved by big-shot art dealers and major modern art museums. They struck me to be at odds with the Edes' founding principle of seeing art in a domestic setting. It's probably my fault for being a hopeless romantic, and I'm sure I'll enjoy many exhibitions held in them over the coming years (the inaugural show, Actions. The Image of the World Can Be Different feels like a limbering up exercise), but I can't help wondering if they are an opportunity missed. The Edes' taste was for mottled walls, light timber, and local brick. Domestic materials. I didn't detect an obvious love for polished concrete or austere environments. But this is only a small gripe about one of the great oases of culture in an increasingly vulgar world. The updating of Kettle's Yard was necessary and it has been done lovingly and thoughtfully by a team who care passionately about it - and us. Rana Begum's installation of bamboo baskets, No. 764 Baskets at St Peter's Church, Cambridge When you go, and I urge you to do so, make the time to pop into the small church by the house which has a sculptural installation made from baskets by the artist Rana Begum. It is quiet and sensitive with an inherent warmth that completely captures the spirit of Kettle's Yard.

"People are warned not to approach Mark Woolley (seen now, left, and in 2001) A convicted killer who ran a woman over as she tried to stop him stealing her handbag has gone on the run after being released from prison on licence. Mark Woolley was jailed for life at the Old Bailey in 2001 for the murder of 42-year-old costume designer Elizabeth Sherlock. He has not been seen since a probation meeting on 31 January, Scotland Yard said. Woolley, 52, was released from HMP Ranby in Nottinghamshire in November. The former heroin addict was convicted of killing Mrs Sherlock after she chased his then-girlfriend Jackie Moorehouse, who stole her bag from a cafe at Euston station. A Metropolitan Police spokesman said: ""He was last seen at a probation meeting in Hackney and breached his conditions on 1 February. ""Woolley is described as a white man, 5ft 4ins in height, of slim build with greying hair and various tattoos and scars on his forehead, jaw and left ear."" Police urged people not to approach him, but to call 999. Elizabeth Sherlock died in the roadside after trying to stop Woolley driving off with her bag Mrs Sherlock chased Moorehouse after her bag - containing just Â£20 in cash, a mobile phone and bank cards - was snatched on 16 April 2001 as she waited with her husband to catch a train to Wigan for her father's birthday. Mrs Sherlock jumped on the bonnet of the then 35-year-old Woolley's Ford Fiesta and clung on to the wiper blades, pleading for her life. As the car sped off she was thrown into the air and run over by a smiling Woolley. Mrs Sherlock was left dying on the roadside, her husband a few feet away. Both Woolley and Moorehouse had scores of previous drug-related convictions and stole to fuel their heroin habit. The couple, from north London, had both denied murder. Moorehouse, then 24, was cleared of the murder and manslaughter but jailed for three years after she admitted snatching the handbag.

"The Israeli F-16 jet crashed near a village in northern Israel An Israeli F-16 fighter jet has crashed after being hit by Syrian air defences during an offensive in Syria, the Israeli military says. The two pilots parachuted to safety before the crash in northern Israel. It is believed to be the first time Israel has lost a jet in the Syrian conflict. The plane was hit during air strikes in response to an Iranian drone launch into Israeli territory, Israel says. The drone was shot down. Israel later launched further strikes in Syria. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) say they hit aerial defence batteries and Iranian military sites in the latest strikes. Israeli air strikes in Syria are not unusual, the BBC's Middle East correspondent Tom Bateman says, but the loss of an Israeli fighter jet marks a serious escalation. Israel 'strikes Damascus military complex' Why is there a war in Syria?

Two soldiers on board were killed, the Turkish military says UN Human Rights Commissioner Zeid Ra'ad al-Hussein said the past week was one of the bloodiest in Syria since the conflict began in 2011 - with at least 277 civilian deaths reported The Israeli military says a ""combat helicopter successfully intercepted an Iranian UAV [unmanned aerial vehicle] that was launched from Syria and infiltrated Israel"".

"This video can not be played Bethany Haines said the men should face justice for her father's murder The families of some of the victims of an Islamic State group that beheaded hostages have said two captured fighters should face trial. British fighters Alexanda Kotey and El Shafee Elsheikh were captured by Syrian Kurdish forces. Bethany Haines - whose father David, a British aid worker, was beheaded by the cell - said she hoped theydie a ""slow, painful death"". Kotey and Elsheikh were two of four UK IS members known as ""the Beatles"". ""They should be locked up and throw away the key,"" Ms Haines said. Should there be a trial, she said she would attend and ""look them in the eye and let them know I am who I am and they have certainly destroyed a big part of my life. Hopefully there will be some justice."" Alexanda Kotey, left, and El Shafee Elsheikh were the last two members of the cell at large Diane Foley - whose son James, an American journalist, was beheaded by the cell - said she wanted the two men to face life imprisonment. She told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""Their crimes are beyond imagination."" Who were the Islamic State 'Beatles'? The gangster who ditched drugs for jihad Which countries have fleeing IS fighters gone to? Mrs Foley said that she would like the men to face trial in the US but she would be ""most grateful"" so long as ""they are brought to fair trial and detained and justice is served"". ""It doesn't bring James back, but hopefully it protects others from this kind of crime,"" she said. Kotey and Elsheikh were the last two of ""the Beatles"", so-called because of their British accents. Kotey, from west London, was a guard for the group that was described by US authorities as an execution cell. The US State Department says hetook part in the torture of hostages,externaland acted as a recruiter for IS. Elsheikh""earned a reputation for waterboarding, mock executions, and crucifixions"",externalwhile serving as the cell's guard, the US state department says. Both are designated terrorists by the US, which says they have used ""exceptionally cruel torture methods"". They worked with the cell's alleged ring-leader, Mohammed Emwazi. Dubbed Jihadi John, he was the masked militant from west London who featured in gruesome IS videos, taunting Western powers before beheading hostages. Mr Foley was one of the victims whose death was seen in those videos. Others were British aid workers David Haines and Alan Henning, US journalist Steven Sotloff, and American aid worker Peter Kassig. Mr Haines was working for a French aid agency when he was captured by Islamic State militants Emwazi waskilled in a drone strike in 2015 in Raqqa, the former de facto IS capital in Syria. Aine Davis, also from west London and the fourth member of the cell, was convicted of being a senior IS member.He was jailed in Turkey last year on terrorism chargesafter being arrested near Istanbul in 2015. The father of Aine Davis has told the BBC that his son had nothing to do with the cell. Nicolas Henin, a French journalist who spent 10 months as an IS captive, told Today that he wanted justice and not revenge. He stressed that any attempt to deny the men of their civil rights would only feed IS's claims of victimisation by the West. ""I will be extremely frustrated if they were not offered a fair trial and I don't think the local authorities in northern Syria or detention in Guantanamo Bay would be justice,"" he said. US officials said the ""execution cell"" had beheaded at least 27 hostages and tortured many more. They confirmed the latest arrests. Officials quoted by US media said the two men had been captured by members of the US-backed Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), who are targeting remnants of IS. A Kurdish official from the SDF has said Kotey was on his way to Turkey when he was captured. ""He was intending to escape towards Turkey with co-operation and co-ordination with friends of his on the Turkish side. He is now under investigation with us,"" Redur Xelil said. A Turkish security official called the claim ""nonsense"". By Gordon Corera, BBC security correspondent The Home Office will not comment on individual cases but it is understood that the two men have been stripped of their British citizenship. In recent years, there has been an increased use of this power, largely in response to those travelling out to Syria and Iraq. The home secretary can deprive someone if that is considered conducive to the public good and doing so would not make them stateless. But there is also the power to remove it if a person obtained their citizenship fraudulently or through naturalisation and there are ""reasonable grounds"" to believe the person is able to become a national of another country. The home secretary has to personally decide to carry out a deprivation.

"British fighters Alexanda Kotey (left) and El Shafee Elsheikh were captured by Syrian Kurdish forces Two captured British fighters should be tried in an international criminal court, rather than sent to Guantanamo Bay, a defence minister has said. Tobias Ellwood told two newspapers it was important that ""terrorists from any origin are transparently and fairly held account for their actions"". The fighters, Alexanda Kotey and El Shafee Elsheikh, were captured by Syrian Kurdish forces in Syria. The BBC understands the pair have been stripped of their UK citizenship. Where should the IS 'Beatles' be tried? They were the last two of four UK IS members known as""the Beatles"", so called because of their British accents. The cell became infamous for its high-profile executions of Western hostages. The Syrian fighters who captured them say they are yet to receive a request from any country to hand them over. It has been suggested they could be sent to the US military prison at Guantanamo Bay. Alternatively, they could be put on criminal trial in the US or at the International Criminal Court, The Hague, which can prosecute people for genocide, war crimes, crimes against humanity and aggression. Mr Ellwood, who lost his brother in a terrorist attack in Bali in 2002 and who himselfwas caught up in the Westminster attacklast year, said Kotey and Elsheikh should be tried at The Hague. Mr Ellwood demanded ""an agreed international process"" for captured fighters, in interviews withThe Times,externaland theDaily Telegraph,external. ""Guantanamo Bay created a new combatant status that bypassed the Geneva convention, used torture and failed to address a wider global jihadist insurgency that continues today,"" he said. Who were the Islamic State 'Beatles'? Which countries have fleeing IS fighters gone to? ""The horror of 9/11 meant we briefly lost sight of the standards and rule of law that took centuries to develop and fundamentally distinguish us from the terrorist."" He added: ""Given the scale of foreign fighters we should consider an agreed international process involving The Hague, which ensures terrorists from any origin are transparently and fairly held account for their actions."" This video can not be played Bethany Haines, whose father David was killed by the cell, on the capture of the IS duo The families of some of the cell's victims have also said the two captured fightersshould face trial. The US Department of Defence spokesman said they were ""still considering options"". ""Rest assured our intention is to hold anyone accountable who commits acts like those they are alleged to have committed,"" Major Adrian Rankine-Galloway from the department said. He confirmed the captured fighters were being held by US-backed Syrian Democratic Forces in a ""detention location"" in Syria. The four members of the IS cell all grew up in west London. Kotey, a guard for the group,took part in the torture of hostages,externaland acted as a recruiter for IS, according to the US State Department. It saidElsheikh ""earned a reputation for waterboarding, mock executions, and crucifixions"",externalwhile serving as the cell's guard.

"Haiti has never fully recovered from the 2010 earthquake that killed thousands of people One of the UK's biggest charities has denied allegations it covered up the use of prostitutes by its aid workers in Haiti. Responding to a report in The Times newspaper, Oxfam admitted that the behaviour of some of its staff had been ""totally unacceptable"". But the charity said it had publicly announced an investigation into the allegations when they surfaced in 2011. Several senior aid workers were dismissed following the investigation. ""The behaviour of some members of Oxfam staff uncovered in Haiti in 2011 was totally unacceptable, contrary to our values and the high standards we expect of our staff,"" a spokeswoman said in a statement. ""Our primary aim was always to root out and take action against those involved and we publicly announced, including to media, both the investigation and the action we took as a result."" Head of Oxfam in Haiti resigns amid inquiry Oxfam said four members of staff were dismissed and three, including the country director, were allowed to resign before the end of the investigation. The director was Roland Van Hauwermeiren, who The Times alleges used prostitutes at a villa rented for him by Oxfam. At the time, the charity said he had left because of serious breaches of its code of conduct. But reports say Oxfam failed to specify the men had been using prostitutes.,externalThe charity denies this, and says it disclosed sexual misconduct to the charities regulator. Oxfam has been working in Haiti, the poorest country in the Americas, since 1978 Dame Barbara Stocking, who was the head of Oxfam in 2011, told the BBC that the charity had a long record of having a very good code of conduct. ""Of course when that happened we looked at it all again,"" she said. ""New whistleblowing procedures were put in place, [there was] more safeguarding work and more training. You just have to have eternal vigilance."" She said Oxfam often worked in very difficult locations ""where the rule of law isn't going on"". UK culture secretary Matt Hancock told the BBC that the allegations were ""abhorrent and completely unacceptable"". ""Oxfam must now provide the Charities Commission with all the evidence they hold of events that happened in Haiti as a matter of urgency,"" he said. ""Charities must ensure that they have the highest standards of transparency and safeguarding procedures in place to protect vulnerable people and maintain the trust of the public."" A spokeswoman for the Charities Commission said: ""In August 2011, Oxfam made a report to the Commission about an ongoing internal investigation into allegations of misconduct by staff members involved in their Haiti programme. ""At the time, and based on the information provided, we were satisfied that the trustees were handling matters appropriately and did not have regulatory concerns."" The spokeswoman added: ""We will expect the charity to provide us with assurance that it has learnt lessons from past incidents"".

"If I had Elon Musk-type money, I would hire a top-notch art gallery curator to clean my house. I would happily be the assistant, undertaking the most menial tasks while the duster-wielding curator concentrated on doing what curators do better than anyone else in the world, which is to arrange things really nicely. Making the shabby chic, transforming a total mess into a harmonious, tonal, soul-calming, eye-pleasing composition is the curator's art. It is a form of alchemy that is genuinely a wonder to behold. You will know this if you've ever been to Kettle's Yard in Cambridge, the former home of one-time Tate Gallery curator Jim Ede and his wife Helen. Jim Ede bought Kettle's Yard in the 1950s From the leather roundel you pull to gain entry, to the Brancusi sculpture of a reclining head placed casually on the lid of a grand piano, every inch, every sightline, has been meticulously considered and intricately planned to deliver the ultimate aesthetic experience. Prometheus by Brancusi Jim gave as much curatorial care and attention to arranging the pebbles he picked up on the beach as he did to his splendid collection of modernist art. Everything mattered. For instance, in the front room there is a small Joan Miro surrealist painting hanging above a spiralled, totemic wooden cider press, to the side of which is a large pewter plate. On that plate is a single fresh lemon, placed on the outer rim and positioned at precisely nine o'clock. Why? Because the fruit's bright yellowness accentuates the solemn greyness of the pewter while also echoing the small lemon shape in Miro's painting, which is at about three o'clock in the picture. As far as the Edes were concerned, the devil wasn't in the detail, beauty was. Tic Tic (1927) by Joan Miro There are hundreds of similar curatorial touches to enjoy as you make your way around the house, which was once four small slum cottages before Jim and Helen bought and renovated them into one dwelling in 1957. Their attention to detail didn't stop at the objects, or even the display thereof; it encompassed the entire experience, most particularly how light affects everything we see and sense. Their idea was to keep ""open house"" every afternoon of the academic term for students and anyone else so inclined to visit ""a living place where works of art could be enjoyed, inherent to the domestic"". It was ""in no way meant to be an art gallery or museum"". That was in the late 50s. In 1966, while still living at Kettle's Yard, the Edes gave the house, its contents, and the majority of their art collection to the University of Cambridge. Before long, the initial trickle of one or two interested students a day had turned into mass of tens, then hundreds, and eventually many thousands of visitors a year. A sympathetic, Le Corbusier-inspired extension was built in 1970 by Sir Leslie Martin and David Owers to accommodate the ever-expanding number of artworks, artefacts and art lovers. The Edes left in 1973 to live in peace and quiet in Scotland. Since then, Kettle's Yard has continued to develop in a slightly haphazard fashion, until the decision was made a few years ago to employ Jamie Fobert (the go-to art world architect for sensitive design projects) to bring some order to the site by creating a new suite of galleries, education spaces, and offices. On Saturday, they open to the public, who will be the first beneficiaries of a proper reception area, cafe and shop. Kettleâs Yard is reopening after an Â£11.3 million redevelopment by architect Jamie Fobert The new galleries are fine, and they have some nice touches, and I'm sure lots of modern art will look good in them. But I have to admit to being just a little bit disappointed by the rather hackneyed combination of concrete floor, smooth white wall and double-height ceiling. Such spaces are two-a-penny nowadays. They are like Prada stores and Range Rovers, classy but now irritatingly ubiquitous; chilly corporate spaces beloved by big-shot art dealers and major modern art museums. They struck me to be at odds with the Edes' founding principle of seeing art in a domestic setting. It's probably my fault for being a hopeless romantic, and I'm sure I'll enjoy many exhibitions held in them over the coming years (the inaugural show, Actions. The Image of the World Can Be Different feels like a limbering up exercise), but I can't help wondering if they are an opportunity missed. The Edes' taste was for mottled walls, light timber, and local brick. Domestic materials. I didn't detect an obvious love for polished concrete or austere environments. But this is only a small gripe about one of the great oases of culture in an increasingly vulgar world. The updating of Kettle's Yard was necessary and it has been done lovingly and thoughtfully by a team who care passionately about it - and us. Rana Begum's installation of bamboo baskets, No. 764 Baskets at St Peter's Church, Cambridge When you go, and I urge you to do so, make the time to pop into the small church by the house which has a sculptural installation made from baskets by the artist Rana Begum. It is quiet and sensitive with an inherent warmth that completely captures the spirit of Kettle's Yard.

"Haiti has never fully recovered from the 2010 earthquake that killed thousands of people Oxfam's chief executive has denied there was any cover-up after it was revealed some of its aid workers used prostitutes in Haiti in 2011. Mark Goldring said the UK-based charity was ashamed of what it had got wrong but had taken action and been proactive about going public on the matter. At the time, the charity only referred to it as ""serious misconduct"". The Department for International Development, which gave Oxfam nearly Â£32m last year, is reviewing funding. Mr Goldring toldBBC Radio 4's Today programmethe charity did ""anything but"" cover the incident up, adding: ""We were very open with the public that we were ashamed of the behaviour of our staff. We still are."" However, he said a report released by the charity did not give details of the allegations. The chief executive said: ""With hindsight, I would much prefer that we had talked about sexual misconduct. ""But I don't think it was in anyone's best interest to be describing the details of the behaviour in a way that was actually going to draw extreme attention to it when what we wanted to do was get on and deliver an aid programme."" He added: ""I am absolutely committedâ¦ to wipe out that kind of behaviour from Oxfam and rebuild that relationship of trust [with the public]."" Oxfam denies cover-up over 'Haiti prostitutes' Head of Oxfam in Haiti resigns amid inquiry Four staff members were dismissed over the revelations and three, including the country director for Haiti, were allowed to resign before the end of the charity's own investigation, it said. The director was Roland Van Hauwermeiren, whoaccording to the Times,external, used prostitutes at a villa rented for him by Oxfam. The staff had been inHaitias part of the relief effort following the devastating magnitude 7.0 earthquake that killed more than 200,000 people there in 2010. The government's review of its relationship with Oxfam comes amid fresh allegations in the paper that the charity failed to alert other aid agencies about the staff members' behaviour. Mr Van Hauwermeiren went on to work elsewhere in the sector. 'I want to break the stigma of painful sex' Pence skips Olympic meal with North Koreans French Muslim quits talent show amid row Meanwhile an Oxfam spokeswoman has said the charity would not have provided a positive reference for any of those who were dismissed or resigned. But she said: ""Unfortunately, there is nothing we can do to stop individuals falsifying references, getting others that were dismissed to act as referees and claiming it was a reference from Oxfam, or former or current Oxfam staff that worked with the individual providing a reference in a personal capacity."" In a statement on Friday, the charity said: ""The behaviour of some members of Oxfam staff uncovered in Haiti in 2011 was totally unacceptable, contrary to our values and the high standards we expect of our staff. ""Our primary aim was always to root out and take action against those involved and we publicly announced, including to media, both the investigation and the action we took as a result."" By Emma Vardy, BBC political correspondent Public confidence in the way Britain's foreign aid money is spent has been undermined by a number of scandals. DfID will now be under pressure to ensure there is zero tolerance of sexual misconduct within agencies that receive government aid funds. It is unclear to what extent DfID may have been made aware of the Oxfam incident back in 2011. Similar cases involving UN peacekeeping soldiers were brought to the attention of the then International Development Secretary Andrew Mitchell. The UK currently spends Â£13bn on aid each year and there have long been calls from some Conservative MPs for cuts to this budget. But Theresa May says she is ""proud"" of the UK's record on foreign aid and remains committed to the UK's requirement to spend 0.7% of the country's gross national income on overseas assistance. Labour, the Liberal Democrats, SNP, Greens and Plaid Cymru also agree that figure should remain. A DfID spokesman said the way ""appalling abuse of vulnerable people"" had been dealt with raised serious questions for Oxfam. He said the department acknowledged that hundreds of Oxfam staff had done nothing wrong, ""but the handling by the senior team about this investigation and their openness with us and the charity commission showed a lack of judgement"". ""We have a zero tolerance policy for the type of activity that took place in this instance, and we expect our partners to as well,"" the spokesman said. ""We often work with organisations in chaotic and difficult circumstances. If wrongdoing, abuse, fraud, or criminal activity occur we need to know about it immediately, in full."" International Development Secretary Penny Mordaunt had requested a meeting with Oxfam's senior team ""at the earliest opportunity"", the spokesman said. This video can not be played Andrew Mitchell 'can't be sure' he knew about the Oxfam case Andrew Mitchell, who was international development secretary in 2011, told BBC's Newsnight it was a ""shudderingly awful tale"" that was ""terrible on every single level"". But he said he could not recall being told about the incident. Dame Barbara Stocking, who was the head of Oxfam in 2011, told the BBC that the charity had a long record of having a very good code of conduct. When it happened, she said, new whistle-blowing procedures, safeguarding practises and training were put in place.

"David Sorensen was a speechwriter who worked at the Council on Environmental Quality A speechwriter has become the second White House aide this week to resign amid allegations of domestic abuse. David Sorensen denies his former wife's allegations he was violent and emotionally abusive. His departure comes just days after another Trump official, Rob Porter, quit over allegations of abuse from two ex-wives, something he denies. Questions have been raised over how long it took the White House to act on the accusations facing Mr Porter. White House regret over abuse claims Mr Sorensen's ex-wifeJessica Corbett told the Washington Post that he was physically abusive to her while they were married,external. She said that on separate occasions her former husband ran a car over her foot, threw her against a wall and extinguished a cigarette on her hand. In response, Mr Sorensen released a statement in which he said he had ""never committed violence of any kind against any woman in my entire life"" and that instead it was he who had been physically abused. He said he was considering legal action, but said he quit because he ""didn't want the White House to have to deal with this distraction"". No longer all the president's men White House officials said they learned of the accusations by Mr Sorensen's wife late on Thursday. ""We immediately confronted the staffer, he denied the allegations and he resigned today,"" deputy press secretary Raj Shah said. Allegations of domestic abuse against Mr Porter involving two ex-wives surfaced on Tuesday. It is alleged that the former White House staff secretary gave one ex-wife a black eye while another filed a restraining order. He denies the allegations. On Friday, Mr Trump paid tribute to Mr Porter, who quit his White House position on Wednesday. This video can not be played Trump on Porter: 'We absolutely wish him well' Speaking in the Oval Office Mr Trump said: ""We found out about it recently and I was surprised by it, but we certainly wish him well and it's a tough time for him."" But Mr Trump did not refer to Mr Porter's accusers. His comments sparked criticism from Democrats, with former Vice-President Joe Biden saying Mr Trump had downplayed the allegations against Mr Porter. ""That's like saying: 'That axe murderer out there, he's a great painter'"", Mr Biden said. The case has put pressure on Mr Trump's Chief-of-Staff John Kelly, who has denied reports he offered to resign over his handling of the accusations. After initially praising Mr Porter as a man of ""integrity"", Mr Kelly later released a statement saying he was shocked by the claims and stressed domestic violence was unacceptable. US media report that Mr Kelly and other White House officials were aware for several months of the domestic abuse accusations because they were holding up Mr Porter's security clearance application. Mr Shah said that Mr Trump was not aware of any security issues before Tuesday and was ""disheartened"" and ""saddened"" by the accusations. White House communications director Hope Hicks' (C) handling of the controversy has reportedly displeased Mr Trump White House communications director Hope Hicks' handling of the controversy has also reportedly displeased Mr Trump. The 29-year-old aide has recently been in a relationship with Mr Porter, a Harvard graduate and former Oxford Rhodes Scholar. Mr Trump was reportedly not consulted when Ms Hicks helped draft an initial statement defending Mr Porter. According to CBS News, Mr Porter approached White House Counsel Don McGahn in January 2017 to inform him his ex-wives might say unflattering things about him to background check investigators. In June 2017, Mr Porter's preliminary file was sent from the FBI to the White House security office, containing the abuse allegations. In November, Mr McGahn received a call from an ex-girlfriend of Mr Porter alleging physical violence by the aide. Mr McGahn told the White House chief of staff there was an issue with Mr Porter's security clearance, although he was vague, reports CBS. Mr Porter told Mr Kelly his ex-wives were saying false things about him. A White House spokesman said on Thursday that Mr Kelly did not realise the extent of the claims until a photo of one of Mr Porter's former wives, Colbie Holderness, suffering a black eye, emerged on Wednesday.

"This video can not be played Bethany Haines said the men should face justice for her father's murder The families of some of the victims of an Islamic State group that beheaded hostages have said two captured fighters should face trial.

Bethany Haines - whose father David, a British aid worker, was beheaded by the cell - said she hoped theydie a ""slow, painful death"". Kotey and Elsheikh were two of four UK IS members known as ""the Beatles"". ""They should be locked up and throw away the key,"" Ms Haines said. Should there be a trial, she said she would attend and ""look them in the eye and let them know I am who I am and they have certainly destroyed a big part of my life. Hopefully there will be some justice."" Alexanda Kotey, left, and El Shafee Elsheikh were the last two members of the cell at large Diane Foley - whose son James, an American journalist, was beheaded by the cell - said she wanted the two men to face life imprisonment. She told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""Their crimes are beyond imagination."" Who were the Islamic State 'Beatles'? The gangster who ditched drugs for jihad Which countries have fleeing IS fighters gone to? Mrs Foley said that she would like the men to face trial in the US but she would be ""most grateful"" so long as ""they are brought to fair trial and detained and justice is served"". ""It doesn't bring James back, but hopefully it protects others from this kind of crime,"" she said. Kotey and Elsheikh were the last two of ""the Beatles"", so-called because of their British accents. Kotey, from west London, was a guard for the group that was described by US authorities as an execution cell. The US State Department says hetook part in the torture of hostages,externaland acted as a recruiter for IS. Elsheikh""earned a reputation for waterboarding, mock executions, and crucifixions"",externalwhile serving as the cell's guard, the US state department says. Both are designated terrorists by the US, which says they have used ""exceptionally cruel torture methods"". They worked with the cell's alleged ring-leader, Mohammed Emwazi. Dubbed Jihadi John, he was the masked militant from west London who featured in gruesome IS videos, taunting Western powers before beheading hostages. Mr Foley was one of the victims whose death was seen in those videos. Others were British aid workers David Haines and Alan Henning, US journalist Steven Sotloff, and American aid worker Peter Kassig. Mr Haines was working for a French aid agency when he was captured by Islamic State militants Emwazi waskilled in a drone strike in 2015 in Raqqa, the former de facto IS capital in Syria. Aine Davis, also from west London and the fourth member of the cell, was convicted of being a senior IS member.He was jailed in Turkey last year on terrorism chargesafter being arrested near Istanbul in 2015. The father of Aine Davis has told the BBC that his son had nothing to do with the cell. Nicolas Henin, a French journalist who spent 10 months as an IS captive, told Today that he wanted justice and not revenge. He stressed that any attempt to deny the men of their civil rights would only feed IS's claims of victimisation by the West. ""I will be extremely frustrated if they were not offered a fair trial and I don't think the local authorities in northern Syria or detention in Guantanamo Bay would be justice,"" he said. US officials said the ""execution cell"" had beheaded at least 27 hostages and tortured many more. They confirmed the latest arrests. Officials quoted by US media said the two men had been captured by members of the US-backed Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), who are targeting remnants of IS. A Kurdish official from the SDF has said Kotey was on his way to Turkey when he was captured. ""He was intending to escape towards Turkey with co-operation and co-ordination with friends of his on the Turkish side. He is now under investigation with us,"" Redur Xelil said. A Turkish security official called the claim ""nonsense"". By Gordon Corera, BBC security correspondent The Home Office will not comment on individual cases but it is understood that the two men have been stripped of their British citizenship. In recent years, there has been an increased use of this power, largely in response to those travelling out to Syria and Iraq. The home secretary can deprive someone if that is considered conducive to the public good and doing so would not make them stateless. But there is also the power to remove it if a person obtained their citizenship fraudulently or through naturalisation and there are ""reasonable grounds"" to believe the person is able to become a national of another country. The home secretary has to personally decide to carry out a deprivation.

"Joy Neville was named World Rugby Referee of the Year in November A female referee has taken charge of a top-level men's rugby union match in the UK for the first time. Joy Neville - a former Irish rugby international - officiated atFriday's Pro14 game between Ulster and Southern Kingsat the Kingspan stadium in Belfast. She was named World Rugby Referee of the Year in November, after turning professional in 2013. Before kick-off, Neville said the match was not the end of her ambitions. In a post on Twitter, she expressed her ""excitement"" and described the historic moment as the ""next opportunity"". The 34-year-old, from Limerick, previously oversaw a Challenge Cup match between Bordeaux-BÃ¨gles and Enisei-STM in December - the first woman to do so. That followed a match between Norway and Denmark in October, in the second tier of international rugby union. Bitcoin arrests at Russian nuclear lab Quiz of the week: What killed royal swans? Eurostar launches London-Amsterdam route She also took charge of the women's 2017 World Cup final between England and New Zealand. Speaking to the BBC, Neville said she had ""never intended"" to be a referee, but considered the move after retiring from playing the sport, following her grand slam with Ireland in 2013. She said a less-than-encouraging conversation with a senior rugby official had only strengthened her determination to succeed. This video can not be played How Neville became the World Rugby Referee of the Year ""I said 'look, I want your opinion on something, I have one question - do you think it's possible for a female referee to ref in division 1A in Ireland', and he said 'Joy, not in my lifetime'"". Her appointment to referee the Pro14 match between Ulster and South Africa's Southern Kings has cemented her place in history. The Pro14 involves teams from Ireland, Italy, Scotland, Wales and, from the start of this season, South Africa. Ulster ran out clear winners in the match,scoring nine tries in a one-sided 59-10 victory. Neville says her ambitions do not end at refereeing Pro14 games, and that ultimately she would like to officiate in the Six Nations tournament. ""To be involved with the Six Nations on the line as an official would be a dream come true. Whether that's achievable...I don't know, but I'll try,"" she said.

"Cristina Garcia has previously said alcohol is not an acceptable excuse for sexual misconduct A California state assemblywoman who rose to national prominence as a campaigner against sexual assault is now herself accused of misconduct. The state legislature is investigating Democrat Cristina Garcia, who featured in a Time magazine profile of #MeToo victims last year. Ms Garcia denies groping another lawmaker's male aide and attempting to fondle a lobbyist. She said she would take a leave of absence during the inquiry. When the allegations first emerged, Ms Garcia said she had ""zero recollection of engaging in inappropriate behaviour"". ""Such behaviour is inconsistent with my values,"" she added. Ms Garcia, who was elected in 2012 and chairs the Legislative Women's Caucus and the Natural Resources Committee. pledged to participate in any investigation. ""Every complaint about sexual harassment should be taken seriously,"" she said. But in a follow-up statement,external, the influential Los Angeles-area lawmaker added: ""Upon reflection of the details alleged, I am certain I did not engage in the behaviour I am accused of.""

She says she volunteered for an unpaid leave of absence ""so as not to serve as a distraction or in any way influence the process of this investigation"", adding that she looks forward to returning to work. The first accusation comes from Daniel Fierro, who said a drunken Ms Garcia cornered him after an annual legislative softball game in 2014 in the team dugout. He said Ms Garcia stroked his back, squeezed his buttocks and attempted to grab his crotch. Mr Fierro told Politico,externalhe did not originally report the incident. He said he was 25 years old at the time. He is not the only man accusing Ms Garcia of unwanted sexual advances. Another accuser, whom Politico described as a prominent lobbyist at California's state capital, claims the lawmaker tried to fondle him at a fundraiser last year. The man, who wished to remain anonymous because he represents a major industry association, said Ms Garcia had leaned in close enough to him that he could smell alcohol on her breath. She whispered that she had ""set a goal"" for herself to have sex with him and used a vulgarity, he said. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The accuser said he stopped Ms Garcia from grabbing his genitals, and told her ""that ain't gonna happen"". The claims come months after the lawmaker told the New York Times she had experienced sexual harassment. ""Multiple people have grabbed my butt and grabbed my breasts,"" she said about alleged incidents in the state capital of Sacramento. ""We're talking about senior lobbyists and lawmakers."" Her story later featured inTime magazine's issue honouring ""silence breakers"". Both Mr Fierro and the lobbyist said Ms Garcia was heavily inebriated at the time of the alleged assaults. In a November interview with the Associated Press news agency about alcohol at political fundraisers, Ms Garcia said that blaming drink is not an acceptable excuse for inappropriate sexual behaviour. ""I would say that most of the public realises that our job is based on relationships, and so we are expected to go out there and socialise,"" she said.
